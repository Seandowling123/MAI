LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it completed the acquisition of Laudamotion 
GmbH in late December.
The Irish budget airline plans to increase Laudamotion's fleet to 25 aircraft by summer, up from 19 aircraft it had in 
the summer of 2018. In addition, Laudamotion has signed agreements with a number of lessors to increase its fleet 
by summer 2020 to 30 aircraft. 
As a result, Ryanair expects Laudamotion's traffic to grow to six million people by March 2020 and to 7.5 million by 
March 2021. 
In Vienna, Austria, Laudamotion's fleet will grow to eight aircraft from four this summer, while the company will also 
operate seven aircraft from Dusseldorf, three from Stuttgart, and two from Palma, Spain.
In winter next year, the Vienna base will increase further to 11 aircraft, making Laudamotion Vienna's second 
largest airline, just behind Austrian Airlines, Ryanair highlighted.
In addition, Laudamotion will hire additional pilots, cabin crew, and engineers, and will move to a new head office at 
Concorde business park, Manchester, in March.
"With the backing of Ryanair, Laudamotion is set to grow strongly over the next three years to carry ten million 
passengers per annum," said Laudamotion Chief Executive Andreas Gruber.
"We are currently negotiating new routes and handling agreements with more than 50 new airports, all of whom 
want to share in Laudamotion's exciting growth plans for the coming years," added Laudamotion Deputy CEO Colin 
Casey.
Ryanair shares were trading 0.3% higher on Tuesday at EUR10.84 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday confirmed its cabin crews in Spain have voted in 
favour of a recognition agreement with the SITCPLA and USO unions.
The Irish budget airline, SITCPLA, and USO are now progressing a collective labour agreement, which is expected 
to conclude before the end of April. 
Ryanair shares were trading flat on Tuesday at EUR10.80 each.
Ryanair has been talking with unions across Europe in recent months. In November, it recognised Portuguese 
union SNPVAC, and the same month signed a labour agreement covering all German cabin crews. 
It has also signed similar agreements with Italian crews, and has been in talks with Greek and Swedish staff.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday reduced its profit guidance, blaming 
lower fares over the winter period.
For its financial year ending March, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion. 
Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion. 
Profit after tax in its previous financial year was EUR1.5 billion, meaning profit will be down as much as 50% in 
financial 2019. The previous year's figure had been up 10% on financial 2017.
Winter fares are expected to fall 7%, Ryanair said, compared to prior guidance of 2%. 
However, the company did guide 9% growth in traffic to 142 million passengers in the current year, stronger 
ancillary sales, and a "slightly" better second-half unit cost performance so far. 
Profit guidance excludes expected EUR140 million start-up losses from Austrian budget carrier Lauda.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "While we are disappointed at this slightly lower full year guidance, the fact it 
is the direct result of lower than expected second half air fares, offset by stronger than expected traffic growth, a 
better than expected performance on unit cost and ancillary sales is positive for the medium term. 
"There is short haul over capacity in Europe this winter, but Ryanair continues to pursue our price passive/load 
factor active strategy to the benefit of our customers who are enjoying record lower air fares," he continued.
"We believe this lower fare environment will continue to shake out more loss making competitors, with WOW, Flybe, 
and reportedly Germania for example, all currently for sale."  
O'Leary also said though there is "reasonable" visibility for fourth-quarter bookings, Ryanair cannot rule out further 
cuts to air fares or another cut to guidance "if there are unexpected Brexit or security developments".

LONDON (Alliance News) - Peel Hunt on Friday said it expects online travel agency On The Beach to benefit from 
current weakness in the European airlines market. 
The broker highlighted On The Beach's share price has jumped 19% over the past month. The stock was trading 
1.7% higher on the day Friday at 438.69 pence a share. 
"Reviewing recent industry news flow we believe the rally can continue ahead of the annual general meeting trading 
statement on February 7,"  said Peel Hunt analyst Ivor Jones.
Irish budget airline Ryanair cut its post-tax profit guidance on Friday, guiding for profit after tax between EUR1.0 
billion and EUR1.1 billion for its financial year ending in March. 
Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion. 
Ryanair expects winter fares to fall 7% compared to prior guidance of 2%. However, the company did guide 9% 
growth in traffic to 142 million passengers in the current year, stronger ancillary sales, and a "slightly" better 
second-half unit cost performance so far.
"Since On The Beach's customers buy Ryanair flights, we assume lower flight prices will help On The Beach sell 
more holidays," said Jones.
In addition, Ryanair has discontinued its Holiday services, which, the broker believes, was a major player in On The 
Beach's market. 
However, Peel Hunt noted the closure of Ryanair Holiday suggests there is more to running an online package 
holiday business than meets the eye and that, perhaps, the new package travel regulations are making life even 
harder for On The Beach's competitors.
IN THE KNOW: On The Beach To Gain From Ryanair Challenges - Peel Hunt
The new regulation was effective from July 1 last year, when more holiday travel arrangements were classified as 
packages. These now include tailor-made trips on websites, where customers select the different elements such as 
flight and hotel. 
Turning to Brexit uncertainty, Peel Hunt said EU Brexit contingency plans were published in December and provide 
for UK to EU flights to continue for a year post a no-deal Brexit. 
The broker believes these plans will remove the risk of UK holiday flights not being able to operate in summer. In 
addition, it lowers the risk of disruption from holidaymakers putting off bookings until certainty emerges. 
"We believe On The Beach's February statement will have an upbeat tone, with growth in bookings despite Brexit, a 
report on the implementation of the long haul strategy and an update on classic package holidays, the product for 
the offline market," added Jones.
Peel Hunt reiterated its Buy rating, saying growth in On The Beach's share price was one of the sharpest bounces 
off the December trough in the sector.

LONDON (Alliance News) - JPMorgan remained positive on European airlines despite concerns about Europe's 
slowing economy and the significant unknowns surrounding Brexit.
With the UK set to leave the European Union on March 29, sentiment on the aviation sector has taken a hit as 
investors weigh up the potential harm to UK businesses. The form of that Brexit is still unclear after Prime Minister 
Theresa May's plans were overwhelmingly rejected by Parliament earlier this week.
Specific arrangements that airlines have with the EU and their ability to trade will be influenced heavily by the high-
level political, trade and customs agreements - if any - put in place. Brexit has created uncertainty over how airlines 
would operate in the EU once the UK departs from the bloc. 
What's more, the opposition Labour party's push for a general election and competing calls for a second 
referendum have compounded this uncertainty. 
JPMorgan's David Perry said Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings remain the most attractive stocks in the 
airline sector, amid all this short-term uncertainty. However, the bank downgraded easyjet on valuation grounds. 
"We consider all three to be long-term winners in the airline industry, with solid structural growth prospects," the 
analyst said. 
JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Ryanair but cut its price target to EUR13.00 from EUR19.75. Ryanair 
shares were down 1.9% at EUR9.83 on Friday after a pre-market profit warning.
Perry highlighted that Ryanair shares have halved from the highs reached in late 2017, and this share price 
weakness presents a significant buying opportunity for investors. 
Ryanair on Friday lowered its annual profit guidance, blaming lower-than-expected winter airfares due to over-
capacity in Europe.
IN THE KNOW: JPMorgan Prefers Ryanair And Wizz Air Over easyJet
For its financial year ending March, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion. 
Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion. 
In October the airline said profit would be dented a spate of air crew strikes and rising fuel prices. 
Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary on Friday also warned that he cannot rule out further downgrades 
to profit guidance.
"While we have reasonable visibility over forward quarter four bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares 
and/or slightly lower full-year guidance if there are unexpected Brexit or security developments which adversely 
impact yields between now and the end of March," O'Leary said.
However, JPMorgan remained positive on Ryanair saying the carrier remains the clear market leader in European 
aviation sector with "best-in-class profitability and a strong balance sheet".
"On our new earnings per share estimates, Ryanair trades on a 10% price-to-earnings ratio premium to easyJet, 
versus an average premium of 20% since 2005. We believe Ryanair deserves a bigger premium to easyJet due to 
its superior profit margins and return of capital employed," Perry said. 
The analyst said it is "very rare" to be able to buy shares in Ryanair at current valuation levels and he sees better 
prospects for the coming summer due to soft comparatives. 
JPMorgan downgraded easyJet to Neutral from Overweight and cut its price target to 1,450 pence from 1,800 
pence. The stock was down 2.6% at 1,138.50p, the worst performer in the FTSE 100 on Friday.
Perry highlighted that based on its historic and expected financial results easyJet was a "good" airline, while 
Ryanair and and Wizz Air were "very good". 
"easyJet currently trades on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10 times, a 30% discount to its long-term 
average of 14 times. If the UK achieves a "soft Brexit" (which isn't guaranteed) then we see meaningful medium-
term upside for the shares. However, as noted above, easyJet's historic valuation discount to Ryanair has largely 
disappeared, and mean reversion is now likely," Perry noted.
JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Wizz Air and kept its price target at 3,750p. Wizz Air was down 1.2% 
at 3,001.00p on Friday. 
Perry highlighted that Wizz Air is the premier airline in Central & Eastern Europe and expects trend growth of 15% 
through to the late 2020s due to low travel penetration and economic growth prospects of the CEE region.
"Wizz has an exceptionally low cost base, with unit costs very similar to Ryanair. Its strong market position and high 
growth potential also make it a valuable strategic asset in our view," the analyst added.

and give Beijing an incentive to make deeper concessions. People close to internal deliberations told the Journal 
that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin proposed the idea of lifting some or all tariffs in a series of strategy 
meetings. They said the aim of easing the tariffs is to advance trade talks and win China's support for longer-term 
reforms. The report followed an earlier WSJ article indicating federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal 
investigation of China's Huawei Technologies for allegedly stealing trade secrets from US partners.

US President Donald Trump has retaliated against his rival, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, saying he was 
postponing her planned trip to Belgium and Afghanistan, citing the ongoing partial shutdown of the US federal 
government. Shortly thereafter, the White House said the US administration's delegation to the World Economic 
Forum in Davos would not head to Switzerland for the annual gathering of world leaders and business elites. The 
measures add to the turmoil of the shutdown, which is now in its fourth week, with no sign of it ending, despite 
increasing warnings about the impact on the economy and the functionality of the federal government.

from 0.9% in the previous month.

Rio Tinto said it delivered a pleasing operational performance in the last quarter of 2018, with copper production a 
particular highlight. Pilbara iron ore shipments of 87.4 million tonnes in the fourth quarter were down 3% on a year 
ago, but 7% higher than the third quarter of 2018. For 2018 as a whole, shipments totalled 338.2 million tonnes, up 
2% on 2017. Bauxite production in 2018 of 50.4 million tonnes was down 1% on last year, while aluminium 
production of 3.5 million tonnes was down 3%. Mined copper was up 33% year-on-year at 633,500 tonnes and 
titanium dioxide slag was down 15% at 1.1 million tonnes. Aluminium output fell due to ongoing labour disruptions 
at the non-managed Becancour smelter in Canada, Rio Tinto said, while copper came in above guidance due to a 
strong performance Escondida in Chile and higher grades at Rio Tinto Kennecott in Utah. "We delivered a solid 
operational performance in the final quarter of 2018, in particular across our copper assets. During the year, we 
further strengthened our asset portfolio, continuing to invest in high quality growth," said Chief Executive Jean-

added, but Lloyds is expected to have all regulatory approvals in place by March 29.

Several London-listed property firms may face rent cuts as troubled retailer Debenhams looks to restructure its 
store portfolio, the Financial Times reported. Debenhams is in talks with landlords to negotiate changes to its store 
portfolio, including 50 store closures, the newspaper said. There is also the possibility of instituting a company 
voluntary arrangement, which would lead to forced rent cuts at some stores and further store closures. Out of 
Debenhams's 165 stores, 30 are owned by listed property companies, with British Land and Intu Properties having 
the highest exposure to the retailer by owning eight stores and six respectively, the FT reported, citing data from

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings reduced its profit guidance, blaming lower fares over the winter period. For its 
financial year ending March, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion. Its 
prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion. Profit after tax in its previous financial year was EUR1.5 
billion, meaning profit will be down as much as 50% in financial 2019. The previous year's figure had been up 10% 
on financial 2017. Winter fares are expected to fall 7%, Ryanair said, compared to prior guidance of 2%. However, 
the company did guide 9% growth in traffic to 142 million passengers in the current year, stronger ancillary sales, 
and a "slightly" better second-half unit cost performance so far. Profit guidance excludes expected EUR140 million 
start-up losses from Austrian budget carrier Lauda.
----------
Rio Tinto said it delivered a pleasing operational performance in the last quarter of 2018, with copper production a 
particular highlight. Pilbara iron ore shipments of 87.4 million tonnes in the fourth quarter were down 3% on a year

----------
Sophos Group fell to the bottom of the FTSE 250 as it reported a "subdued billings performance" for the third 
quarter of its financial year, which is expected to continue into the final quarter. For the three months to the end of 
December, billings dipped by 0.6% to USD193.7 million from USD194.0 million. For the nine-month period, billings 
increased slightly by 1.9% to USD546.4 million from USD536.3 million. Sophos attributed the subdued performance 
to a "modest decline" in billings from new customers, and a decline in hardware billings. This led to earnings before 
interest, taxes, deprecation and amortisation declining by 8.3% for the nine-month period to USD103.9 million from 
USD113.3 million. The group expects third quarter trends to continue into the final quarter of its financial year, 
which would lead to a modest decline in constant currency billings.
----------
Bakkavor Group reiterated expectations for 2018 as it reported 1.8% like-for-like revenue growth for its core UK 
division despite weak consumer confidence. The company, which makes salads, pizza, ready meals and soups on 
behalf of UK supermarkets like Tesco, J Sainsbury, WM Morrison Supermarkets and Waitrose, recorded 3.2% year-
on-year growth in group like-for-like revenue for the 52 weeks to December 29. Reported revenue increased 2.2%. 
Bakkavor's international division, comprising businesses in the US and China, delivered "good" volume growth 
leading to a 16% year-on-year jump in like-for-like revenue. 
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were higher amid progress in US-China trade talks. ITV was the best blue chip performer, 
rebounding from sharp losses on Friday after being hit by a broker downgrade. The pound was marginally higher 
against the dollar despite disappointing UK retail sales data. Wall Street was pointed to a higher open with oilfield 
services company Schlumberger reporting earnings before the market open in New York.

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK retail sales slowed in December from the prior month, as Black Friday sales shifted consumer spending away 
from the previously all-important Christmas season, the latest UK retail sales figures released by the Office for 
National Statistics showed. Data released from the ONS on Friday showed during the five weeks from November 
25 to December 29, the overall quantity bought decreased by 0.9% on the prior month, as all sectors excluding food 
and fuel declined. The time period excluded Black Friday but included the technology sales day Cyber Monday. If

compared with the same period a year earlier, December 2018 sales were up 3.7% in value and 3.0% in quantity. 
Meanwhile, in the three months to December, sales dipped 0.2% by volume and 0.1% by amount spent on the 
previous three months, with declines across all main sectors except fuel.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are set for a higher open Friday, as lower air fares over the 
winter led Ryanair to cut its profit guidance for its current financial year. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 32 points higher at 6,866.30. The blue-chip index closed down 
27.76 points, or 0.4%, at 6,834.92 on Thursday.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed 1.3% higher Friday. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 1.4%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is 1.2% higher in late trade.
On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported US officials are "debating ratcheting back tariffs" as a way to bring 
some calm to markets and give China an incentive to make further concessions.
"Only yesterday we were discussing the weaker sentiment from increased US-Sino tensions, as the US took aim at 
Huawei. Overnight rumours went into reverse," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler.
"Talk of easing tensions were helping lift riskier assets. It seems almost impossible to sensibly gauge where US-
China relations stand. Yet the market hangs on each headline, highlighting just how sensitive it is to the ongoing 
trade issue."
"Last night, Wall Street surged higher on reports US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing for rolling back 
some tariffs levied on Chinese imports. Trade tensions have been weighing on investor sentiment for months, 
dragging equity, and more specifically industrials, on a roller coaster ride," he added. 
In the US on Thursday Wall Street ended in the green, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 0.7% higher, 
the S&P 500 0.8% higher, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.7%.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Ryanair In Profit Warning On Fare Cuts
In early UK corporate news, Irish budget airline Ryanair has reduced its profit guidance, blaming lower fares over 
the winter period.
For its financial year ending March, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion. 
Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion.
Profit after tax in its previous financial year was EUR1.5 billion, meaning profit will be down as much as 50% in 
financial 2019. The previous year's figure had been up 10% on financial 2017.
Winter fares are expected to fall 7%, Ryanair said, compared to prior guidance of 2%.
However, the company did guide 9% growth in traffic to 142 million passengers in the current year, stronger 
ancillary sales, and a "slightly" better second-half unit cost performance so far.
Profit guidance excludes expected EUR140 million start-up losses from Austrian budget carrier Lauda.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "While we are disappointed at this slightly lower full-year guidance, the fact it 
is the direct result of lower-than-expected second-half air fares, offset by stronger than expected traffic growth, a 
better-than-expected performance on unit cost and ancillary sales is positive for the medium term." 
In the FTSE 100, Rio Tinto had a "pleasing" operational performance in the last quarter of 2018, with copper 
production a particular highlight.
Pilbara iron ore shipments of 87.4 million tonnes in the fourth quarter were down 3% on a year ago, but 7% higher 
than the third quarter of 2018. For 2018 as a whole, shipments totalled 338.2 million tonnes, up 2% on 2017.
Bauxite production in 2018 of 50.4 million tonnes was down 1% on last year, while aluminium production of 3.5 
million tonnes was down 3%. Mined copper was up 33% year-on-year at 633,500 tonnes and titanium dioxide slag 
was down 15% at 1.1 million tonnes.
Aluminium output fell due to ongoing labour disruptions at the non-managed Becancour smelter in Canada, Rio 
Tinto said, while copper came in above guidance due to a strong performance Escondida in Chile and higher 
grades at Rio Tinto Kennecott in Utah.
Safety, health, and environmental technology firm Halma has bought Rath Communications for USD32.6 million in 
cash. Rath provides emergency communication systems for Refuge Areas in the US. 
In the FTSE 250, IT firm Sophos reported 2% growth in constant currency billings for the third quarter ended 
December, with growth also 2% in the nine months year-to-date.
Sophos said "continued subdued performance" is partly due to a strong comparative period a year prior, and it 
expects trends in the third quarter to continue into the quarter ending March. 
Revenue is up 14% year-to-date, with subscription revenue 18% higher year-to-date and up 15% in the third quarter 
year-on-year at constant currency. 
Adjusted operating profit more than doubled year-to-date, Sophos said, due to strong revenue growth while it has 
posted a year-to-date operating profit of USD51 million from a loss of USD25 million year-on-year. 
Fresh and prepared food firm Bakkavor said revenue for its that year ended December 29 rose 2.2%, and 3.2% 
like-for-like, with "good" progress made across the company. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Ryanair In Profit Warning On Fare Cuts
In the UK, despite weak consumer confidence, like-for-like revenue increased 1.8%. Internationally, like-for-like 
revenue climbed 16% due to "good" volume growth. 
Overall, Bakkavor said this is a "robust" performance with expectations for the recently completed year unchanged. 
Elsewhere, property and construction firm Henry Boot said real estate activity met expectations for 2018. Excluding 
a one-off pension provision, it would have beaten expectations. 
This came despite "more challenging" conditions, Henry Boot said, with Brexit uncertainty hurting the real estate 
market in the UK.
The company's Hallam Land Management business did "exceptionally well", Henry Boot said, though uncertainty 
did hinder the performance of the Developments arm. 
Eddie Stobart Logistics posted 35% growth in revenue for its year ended November to around GBP843 million, 
beating market expectations. Like-for-like revenue rose 18%.
Eddie Stobart won GBP162 million of new contracts for the year, while margins have improved and are expected to 
improve further in its current financial year.
Underlying earnings before interest and tax are guided to meet market expectations. 
Back in the US, President Donald Trump has retaliated against his rival, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, 
saying he was postponing her planned trip to Belgium and Afghanistan, citing the ongoing partial shutdown of the 
US federal government.
Shortly thereafter, the White House said the US administration's delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos 
would not head to Switzerland for the annual gathering of world leaders and business elites next week. 
The measures add to the turmoil of the shutdown, which is now in its fourth week, with no sign of it ending, despite 
increasing warnings about the impact on the economy and the functionality of the federal government. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May also has cancelled her planned attendance at Davos, as she battles to save her 
Brexit deal. "She won't be going to Davos," a Downing Street spokeswoman told dpa by telephone. "She will be 
staying to deal with other issues here."
Other government officials will still represent the UK in Davos, the spokeswoman added.
In the UK on Friday are retail sales figures for December at 0930 GMT.
"In November UK retail sales surged 1.4%, surpassing the most optimistic of expectations, largely as a result of 
Black Friday promotions and discounting," noted CMC's Hewson.
"The picture for December is unlikely to be anywhere near as good and given other similar surveys its quite likely 
that any spending could well have been left quite late, if it came at all," he continued.
The pound was higher quoted at USD1.2965 early Friday, compared to USD1.2920 at the London equities close on 
Thursday.
The international economic events calendar on Friday has eurozone current account numbers at 0900 GMT.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London were higher at midday on Friday on hopes of a breakthrough 
surrounding the US-China trade talks.
There is some progress in US-China trade talks, with reports suggesting that the US is considering lifting tariffs on 
Chinese imports to calm volatile stock markets and encourage Beijing to make concessions in ongoing trade talks.
The Wall Street Journal newspaper on Thursday reported the US is considering lifting tariffs on Chinese goods in 
an effort to calm markets and give Beijing an incentive to make deeper concessions. People close to internal 
deliberations told the Journal that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin proposed the idea of lifting some or all tariffs 
in a series of strategy meetings. 
The FTSE 100 was up 81.58 points, or 1.2%, at 6,916.50, while the FTSE 250 was 125.81 points higher, or 0.7%, 
at 18,663.41. The AIM All-Share was up 0.7% at 910.40.
The Cboe UK 100 was up 1.3% at 11,751.28, while the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.9% at 16,672.33 and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies up 0.3% at 11,080.08.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.4%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt 1.1% was higher at midday.
"The WSJ article yesterday describing talks within the government of a potential easing in tariffs currently imposed 
on Chinese imports has helped boost market sentiment. Ultimately, with the US seeking concessions from the 
Chinese, they are clearly becoming aware that they will need to show good faith, and markets are clearly taking this 
potential move as a step closer to finding a deal between the two sides," said IG market analyst Joshua Mahony.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Stocks Higher On US-China Trade Optimism
On the London Stock Exchange, ITV was the best blue chip performer, up 3.6% with shares in the broadcaster 
rebounding after being hit by a broker downgrade on Thursday. The stock closed down down 5.9% on Thursday.
At the other end of the large cap index, airlines were lower suffering a negative read-across after Irish carrier 
Ryanair Holdings issued a profit warning.
Ryanair shares were down 1.9%.
easyJet was the worst performer, down 2.4% and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group 
was down 1.0%. easyJet was downgraded to Neutral from Overweight by JPMorgan.
For its financial year ending March, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax of between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 
billion. Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion.
Profit after tax in its previous financial year was EUR1.5 billion, meaning profit will be down as much as 50% in 
financial 2019. The previous year's figure had been up 10% on financial 2017. Winter fares are expected to fall 7%, 
Ryanair said, compared to prior guidance of 2%. 
ThinkMarkets analyst Naeem Aslam commented; "if you want to keep your investors happy, you need to make sure 
that you are running your affairs correctly. You cannot just afford battles with unions, or strikes as both of these 
effect company's growth number and most importantly you want to show that your customer service policies and 
the image is friendly and Ryanair really needs to get a good grip on this."
In the FTSE 250, Greencoat UK Wind was up 4.7% after the UK wind farms investor raised its annual payout 
following an increase in net asset value per share over 2018. 
The mid-cap company reported NAV of GBP1.39 billion as at December 31, or 123.1 pence per share. As at the 
end of 2017, Greencoat's NAV was GBP1.14 billion, or 111.2p a share. 
Greencoat declared a dividend of 1.69p per share for the final quarter of 2018, taking the total payout for the year to 
6.76p per share, up from 6.49p paid the year prior. For 2019, the company is targeting a dividend of 6.94p per 
share.
At the other end of the midcap index, Sophos Group was the worst performer, down 24% after the cyber security 
company reported a "subdued billings performance" for the third quarter of its financial year, which is expected to 
continue into the final quarter. 
For the three months to the end of December, billings dipped by 0.6% to USD193.7 million from USD194.0 million. 
For the nine-month period, billings increased slightly by 1.9% to USD546.4 million from USD536.3 million. 
Sophos attributed the subdued performance to a "modest decline" in billings from new customers, and a decline in 
hardware billings. This led to earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation and amortisation declining by 8.3% for the 
nine-month period to USD103.9 million from USD113.3 million. 
Notably, the group expects third quarter trends to continue into the final quarter of its financial year, which would 
lead to a modest decline in constant currency billings.
The pound was marginally higher, quoted at USD1.2955 at midday compared to USD1.2920 at the London equities 
close on Thursday, despite disappointing UK retail sales data. 
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Stocks Higher On US-China Trade Optimism
UK retail sales slowed in December from the prior month, as Black Friday sales shifted consumer spending away 
from the previously all-important Christmas season, the latest UK retail sales figures released by the Office for 
National Statistics showed. 
Data released from the ONS on Friday showed during the five weeks from November 25 to December 29, the 
overall quantity bought decreased by 0.9% on the prior month, as all sectors excluding food and fuel declined. The 
time period excluded Black Friday but included the technology sales day Cyber Monday. 
If compared with the same period a year earlier, December 2018 sales were up 3.7% in value and 3.0% in quantity. 
Meanwhile, in the three months to December, sales dipped 0.2% by volume and 0.1% by amount spent on the 
previous three months, with declines across all main sectors except fuel.
Stocks in New York are seen opening higher taking cues from Asia and Europe amid the positive trade sentiment. 
The DJIA was called up 0.5% and the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite were both called up 0.3%.
After the US closing bell on Thursday, credit card provider American Express reported quarterly earnings that 
missed Wall Street expectations, while online video streaming company Netflix topped fourth quarter subscriber and 
profit estimates.
In the US earnings calendar, the world's largest oilfield services firm Schlumberger will report fourth quarter 
earnings before the opening bell in New York. 
Financial markets in the US are closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Day while world leaders will gather in 
Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum starting on Tuesday.

IN THE KNOW: Pricing Hurts Ryanair While Wizz Air Shines - Berenberg

LONDON (Alliance News) - Berenberg on Tuesday cut Ryanair to Sell from Hold due to elevated short-haul pricing 
risks, but retained its Buy recommendation for Wizz Air shares.
The broker said it downgraded Ryanair as the Irish budget airline faces sustained competitive pressure to its 
pricing, while its cost progress remains highly uncertain. 
"Sustained challenges from lower fares and non-headline fuel costs lead us to lower our financial 2019 net income 
estimate to below the company's guidance range," explained Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik.
The broker now expects Ryanair to report net income, or profit after tax, of EUR1.02 billion for the year to the end of 
March, down 30% from GBP1.45 billion reported in financial 2018.
In October, Ryanair cut its annual guidance due to higher oil prices and now expects to report profit after tax of 
between EUR1.10 billion and EUR1.20 billion. It had previously expected to deliver profit after tax in a range of 
EUR1.25 billion and EUR1.35 billion.
Looking further ahead, the investment bank said it expects another down year in net income in Ryanair's financial 
2020 as it sees "fewer paths" to grow. 
Berenberg assumes that Ryanair's profit after tax in financial 2020 will fall by 4.2% on financial 2019 to EUR980 
million. 
The analyst explained that Ryanair's LaudaMotion acquisition in Vienna gave it desirable slots from central Europe 
on key leisure routes, but competitors, including Wizz Air, have back-filled capacity at record speed. 
"We expect growing pricing pressure," said Yanoshik. "Growth by both Wizz Air and Lufthansa's Eurowings will 
continue to strain yields as Ryanair's LaudaMotion fights a strategic battle in Vienna with a not-yet-Ryanair cost 
structure."
IN THE KNOW: Pricing Hurts Ryanair While Wizz Air Shines - Berenberg
Ryanair acquired the remaining 75% interest in Austrian airline Laudamotion GmbH in July last year for less than 
EUR50 million. LaudaMotion holds the assets of former Austrian airline Niki.
Berenberg lowered its price target on Ryanair shares to EUR9.75 from EUR12.60 forecast previously. Ryanair 
shares were trading 0.6% lower on Tuesday at EUR10.60 each. The stock declined 32% in 2018.
Meanwhile, the broker continued to rate Wizz Air a Buy due to its unique ability to fight unit revenue pressure and 
further grind down unit costs.
"We view Wizz Air as more insulated than its peers to pricing concerns due to its isolated network, with more than 
half of its capacity operating without market competition," said Yanoshik.
Berenberg believes that while Ryanair, International Consolidated Airlines and Lufhansa will strain yields in Vienna, 
Wizz Air's operations in Romania and Bulgaria have a potential to offer pricing upside. IAG opened operations in 
Vienna for its Level budget carrier in July.
In addition, the broker expects Wizz Air to generate cost savings of USD1.5 million per aircraft per annum on new 
leases, while larger A321 aircraft also will contribute 20% in unit cost improvements.
"Wizz Air offers clearer, stronger growth prospects at higher earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, 
amortization, and restructuring or rent costs margins than Ryanair," said Yanoshik.
Despite its positive stance, Berenberg cut its price target on Wizz Air shares to 3,600 pence from 3,800p earlier. 
Wizz Air shares were down 1.1% on Tuesday at 2,896.00p each. The stock was down 20% in 2018.

Ryanair Named Worst UK Airline For 6th Year In Row By Consumer Survey
Ryanair Named Worst UK Airline For 6th Year In Row By Consumer Survey

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been named the worst airline serving UK airports for the 
sixth year in a row.
An annual survey by consumer group Which? found that passengers gave the Dublin-based carrier the lowest 
possible rating for boarding, seat comfort, refreshments and cabin environment.
This lead to an overall customer score of just 40%.
Of those who said there was one airline with which they would never travel, more than two out of three (70%) 
named Ryanair.
Which? recorded 12,459 flying experiences from 7,901 of its members.
In December the Civil Aviation Authority launched enforcement action against Ryanair over its decision not to pay 
compensation for flight disruption resulting from industrial action by its staff during summer 2018.
The airline has also faced criticism for changing its hand luggage policy twice last year, resulting in charges for 
passengers flying with small wheelie suitcases.
One passenger told Which?: "There are too many rules. I worry about getting caught with hidden costs."
The consumer group also highlighted that Ryanair made GBP1.75 billion last year from extras, such as assigned 
seating, priority boarding and luggage fees.
Other names at the bottom of the ranking for short-haul flights were Thomas Cook Airlines (52%) - part of Thomas 
Cook Group PLC - Wizz Air Holdings PLC (54%), and Vueling Airlines (54%) and British Airways (56%), both part of 
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.
easyJet PLC came in the middle of the ranking at 63%.
Ryanair Named Worst UK Airline For 6th Year In Row By Consumer Survey
The highest scores for airlines making short-haul trips were earned by Aurigny (81%), Swiss Airlines (80%) and 
Jet2 (75%).
A Ryanair spokeswoman said the research did not take into account the cost of fares – which is "the single most 
important factor for UK consumers" – and described it as "totally unrepresentative" compared with its 141 million 
annual passengers.
She added that the airline's average fare of GBP35 is "a fraction of the high fares charged by Which's 
'recommended' airlines".
Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel magazine, said: "Airfares might seem to be getting cheaper, but only if you 
don't fancy sitting with your family and children or taking even a small cabin bag on-board.
"Increasingly you need a calculator to work out what the final bill will be, especially with Ryanair.
"It has spent the last two years cancelling thousands of flights, ruining hundreds of thousands of holidays and 
flouting the rules on compensation as well.
"The results of our survey show passengers are fed up. They should switch to one of their rivals, who prove that 
budget prices don't have to mean budget service."
– Here are the top three airlines for short-haul flights, according to Which? research (customer score in brackets):
1. Aurigny (81%)
2. Swiss Airlines (80%)
3. Jet2 (75%)
– Here are the worst three:
1. Ryanair (40%)
2. Thomas Cook Airlines (52%)
=3. Wizz Air (54%)
=3. Vueling Airlines (54%)
– Here are the top three airlines for long-haul flights:
1. Singapore Airlines (85%)
2. Emirates (81%)
3. Qatar Airways (80%)
– Here are the worst three:
1. American Airlines (52%)
2. United Airlines (55%)
3. Thomson/Tui Airways (56%)

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday confirmed its British unit has secured an air 
operator certificate from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
The Irish budget airline said the certificate will allow it to operate UK domestic and UK to non-EU routes in a post-
Brexit environment, if necessary.
Looking ahead, Ryanair continues to call on the UK and EU to agree a transition deal from March 31, so any 
disruption to flights and British consumer summer holidays in 2019 can be avoided.
"We welcome the Civil Aviation Authority's decision to grant our UK based airline, Ryanair UK, with a UK air 
operator certificate," said Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer Juliusz Komorek. 
"The risk of a 'no deal' Brexit in March is rising, and despite our robust post-Brexit structures, including our post-
Brexit plan around European ownership, we continue to call for the UK and EU to agree a transition deal from 
March 31," added Komorek.
Ryanair shares were trading 0.1% lower on Thursday at EUR10.50 each.
Earlier on Thursday, Ryanair said December passenger numbers totalled 10.3 million, up 11% from 9.3 million 
passengers a year before. Its load factor remained unchanged at 95%.
The airline operated 57,000 flights in December, of which 81% arrived on time. According to the company, this 
meant it delivered "the best punctuality of any major EU airline" for the period.
On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair's traffic was up 8.0% to 139.2 million from 128.9 million.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are set to open lower on Thursday after a volatile session on 
Wednesday, which saw the FTSE 100 rally from substantial early losses to close in the green.
However, sentiment was dented overnight by a downbeat outlook from iPhone maker Apple after the US market 
close. Apple blamed a weak Chinese market for its lower-than-expected sales, compounding fears over a slowdown 
in China after the world's second largest economy reported some weak manufacturing data earlier in the week.
In early company news, Next said Christmas sales were in line with forecasts but nudged down its annual profit 
guidance. Drugmaker Vectura said it expects to beat earnings consensus forecasts. Ryanair and Wizz Air both 
reported a rise in December passenger numbers. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open down 35.63 points at 6,698.60 on Thursday. The 
index closed up 6.10 points, or 0.1%, at 6,734.23 on Wednesday after hitting a low of 6,599.48 in early dealings.
"European stock markets saw a major swing yesterday, and they endured a severe sell-off at the start of the 
session, but there was rally in the afternoon, and the FTSE 100 and DAX managed to end the day slightly in 
positive territory. The major US indices also saw a volatile session, whereby it also endured heavy losses initially, 
but managed to eke out a small gain in in the end," commented David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.
He continued: "In after-hours trading on Wall Street, Apple lowered its first-quarter guidance due to weaker sales in 
China. The update sent the stock lower, and it put pressure on US index futures."
Apple shares shed nearly to 8% in post-market trade after the iPhone maker said it now expects first-quarter 
revenue of around USD84 billion, down from its prior estimate of between USD89 billion to USD93 billion.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Next Festive Sales In Line But Outlook Lowered
Apple said it did not expect the magnitude of the economic deceleration in emerging markets, particularly in China. 
The company said most of its revenue shortfall compared to guidance, and over 100% of year-over-year worldwide 
revenue decline, occurred in China across its iPhone, Mac and iPad products.
Worrying manufacturing data from China earlier on Wednesday and also on Monday had heightened fears over an 
economic slowdown, as the country's two manufacturing PMI scores both fell below the neutral mark of 50 into 
contraction.
In the US on Wednesday, prior to the Apple update, Wall Street had ended in positive territory, with the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average closing slightly higher, up 0.1%, the S&P 500 also up 0.1% and Nasdaq Composite rising 0.5%.
US futures are pointed to a sharply lower open on Thursday, however, with the Dow Jones pointed down 1.6%, the 
S&P 500 also down 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite - of which Apple is a constituent - down 2.6%.
In Asia on Thursday, markets in Japan remain closed. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed flat, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.2%.
In UK company news, Next nudged its annual profit guidance slightly lower as Christmas trading came in line with 
forecasts but with higher sales of seasonal products, squeezing margins. 
Full-price sales in the Christmas trading period were up 1.5% on last year, in line with guidance. Strong sales in the 
three weeks prior to Christmas helped to make up for a disappointing performance in November, the company said. 
For the full year, ending later in January, the company expects full price sales growth of 3.2%, in line with previous 
guidance. However, central guidance for full-year profit is now GBP723 million, 0.6% lower than previous guidance 
of GBP727 million. 
This difference is a result of two factors, the company said, the first being higher sales on seasonal lines, such as 
personalised gifts and beauty ranges. While these categories make a "healthy" net margin, it is lower than that 
achieved in clothing ranges and thus reduced profit by GBP1.5 million. 
The remaining GBP2.5 million gap between previous profit guidance and the new forecast was due to the increased 
operational costs associated with higher-than-expected Online sales, Next said. 
For the 2020 financial year, Next's full-price sales growth guidance is 1.7%, in line with the second half performance 
of its current financial year. Within this forecast, Retail sales are expected to fall 8.5% while Online sales are to rise 
11%. 
"Any sales forecast made in January comes with a high degree of uncertainty. This year uncertainty around the 
performance of the UK economy after Brexit makes forecasting particularly difficult. We have not factored into our 
sales estimates the potential benefits of a smooth transition or the downsides of a disorderly Brexit," the company 
noted. 
Budget carrier Wizz Air reported a rise in passengers and an improvement in load factor for December.
Passengers in December were up 18% on last year, while load factor improved 1.3 percentage points to 88.8% 
from 87.5%. Capacity for the month rose 17% to 3.0 million seats. 
Meanwhile, larger peer Ryanair reported 12% growth in passengers in December at 10.3 million. Load factor was 
unchanged at 95%.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Next Festive Sales In Line But Outlook Lowered
Vectura said it expects annual revenue in line with market consensus but earnings to be "materially above".
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation is expected to be "materially" ahead of 
market consensus, which the company put down to revenue mix, productivity initiatives and margin improvements. 
Research & development investment for the full year is expected to be at, or around, the bottom of its GBP55 
million to GBP65 million guidance range. 
DNO said it has decided to extend its hostile takeover offer for Faroe Petroleum for another fortnight after receiving 
acceptances from just over 13% of the UK and Norway-focused oil and gas company's shares. 
DNO already owns just below a 30% stake in the company, taking the level of acceptances to 43%, below its 
acceptance condition of securing one share more than 57.5% of Faroe's share capital.
If the offer lapses, DNO warned it will not be able to make a new offer for another 12 months.
"Whether DNO achieves its acceptance condition or not, its goal will continue to be to safeguard DNO's significant 
investment in Faroe. DNO will redouble efforts to replace entrenched directors and achieve appropriate board 
representation for the owners of Faroe to achieve greater transparency and scrutiny," DNO added. 
Faroe - which has consistently deemed the offer "opportunistic" - on Wednesday published an independent 
valuation of its assets, of which the findings implied a valuation for Faroe itself in the range of 186 pence to 225p 
per share, representing a 22% to 48% premium to DNO's offer price of 152 pence.
In the economic calendar on Thursday is the UK's construction PMI, due at 0930 GMT. The reading is expected to 
come in at 52.9 for December, down from the 53.4 reported in November. 
In the US, private payroll processor ADP releases employment change figures for November at 1315 GMT, a 
precursor to Friday's monthly nonfarm payrolls report. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been urged to delay the "meaningful vote" on her Brexit deal for a second 
time.
Former Brexit secretary David Davis has speculated the vote could be put off if May looks likely to lose it. The vote, 
which was delayed at the last minute in December, is currently scheduled for the week beginning January 14.
His comments come as the prime minister prepares to meet EU leaders and seek further "clarifications" in a bid to 
persuade sceptical MPs to back her deal.
She is expected to speak this week to EU leaders including German chancellor Angela Merkel, Dutch prime 
minister Mark Rutte and European Council president Donald Tusk in an attempt to break the Brexit logjam, the 
Financial Times has reported.
A Downing Street source told the Press Association that talks between May's negotiators and their counterparts in 
Brussels have continued over the Christmas period.
May's ongoing talks with her EU counterparts comes as the UK government launches a publicity drive to prepare 
the public for a possible no-deal Brexit.
Whitehall departments and the health regulator are to begin publishing guidance on how the public can get ready 
for potential issues that may arise from a disorderly break from Europe, the Brexit Secretary has said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Next said trading in the key Christmas period came in line with the company's expectations, though the retailer 
lowered its annual profit guidance. Next, the first London-listed retailer to reveal its performance for the important 
festive trading period, said strong sales in the three weeks prior to Christmas along with a good half-term holiday 
week at the end of October made up for disappointing sales in November. For the period from October 28 to 
December 29, the retailer recorded full price sales growth of 1.0% on the year ago period, with online sales rising 
15% and retail sales declining 9.2%. Total full price sales including interest income for the period grew 1.5% on the 
prior year, in line with the company's September guidance.
----------
Budget airline Ryanair said its traffic grew in December, while smaller peer Wizz Air experienced an even sharper 
rise. Ryanair said its December passengers totalled 10.3 million, up 11% from 9.3 million passengers a year before. 
Its load factor remained unchanged at 95%. Wizz Air posted a 18% increase in passenger traffic to 2.660 million 
from 2.248 million the year before. Wizz Air's load factor increased 1.3 percentage points to 88.8% from 87.5% 
year-on-year and its capacity increased to 3.0 million seats from 2.6 million.
----------
Shares of US tech giant Apple plunged 7% in after-hours trade in New York on Wednesday after the tech giant 
lowered its first-quarter guidance. California-based Apple now expects first-quarter revenue of about USD84 billion, 
down from its prior estimate of between USD89 billion to USD93 billion. Apple now expects gross margin of about 
38%, down from previous estimate of between 38% and 38.5%. Apple said it did not expect the magnitude of the 
economic deceleration in emerging markets, particularly in China. The company said most of its revenue shortfall to 
guidance, and over 100% of year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in China across the iPhone, Mac 
and iPad products.
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Apple Sours Markets With iPhone Sales Warning
----------
Tesla Motors shares closed down 6.8% on Wednesday after missing market expectations for deliveries and 
announcing price cuts for its luxury electric cars. The steep drop comes after the firm, headed up by Elon Musk, 
reported fourth-quarter deliveries of 90,700 vehicles, up 8% from the third quarter but below analyst estimates for 
about 92,000. Tesla also said it is reducing the price of Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles in the US by 
USD2,000 to partially absorb a reduction of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles.
----------
MARKETS
----------
Stocks in Europe were lower with US futures also pointing to a downbeat start after tech giant Apple, after Wall 
Street closed on Wednesday, fanned fears of an economic slowdown in China as it blamed the region for 
disappointing sales and cut its outlook. Retailers were the best performers in London after Next's reassuring 
Christmas update, with shares in peers such as Marks & Spencer and Associated British Foods higher.

FTSE 100: down 0.4% at 6,705.24
FTSE 250: down 0.1% at 17,562.33

(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK construction sector expanded at the slowest rate in three months at the end of 2018, though it remained in 
growth territory for the ninth consecutive month, the IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index showed. The 
PMI reading came in at 52.8 in December, down from 53.4 in November and slightly below consensus forecasts of 
52.9. The score remained above the neutral mark of 50, which separates expansion from contraction. December's 
score signalled only a modest rate of expansion, Markit said, as it was the weakest pace seen since September. 
The slowdown in construction growth mainly reflected softer rises in commercial and housing activity during 
December, said Markit. However, a bright spot was civil engineering activity, which rose at the fastest pace since 
May 2017.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been urged to delay the "meaningful vote" on her Brexit deal for a second 
time. She is expected to speak this week to EU leaders including German chancellor Angela Merkel, Dutch prime 
minister Mark Rutte and European Council president Donald Tusk in an attempt to break the Brexit logjam, the 
Financial Times has reported. A Downing Street source told the Press Association that talks between May's 
negotiators and their counterparts in Brussels have continued over the Christmas period. The talks come as the UK 
government prepares to launch a publicity drive to prepare the public for a possible no-deal Brexit. Whitehall 
departments and the health regulator are to begin publishing guidance on how the public can get ready for potential 
issues that may arise from a disorderly break from Europe, the Brexit Secretary has said.
----------
The UK economy ended last year stuck in a "weak holding pattern", with uncertainty over Brexit hitting sales and 
recruitment, according to a new report. Problems hiring staff are at near-record highs, a survey of 6,000 firms 
suggested. The British Chambers of Commerce said its study indicated that growth in the economy had 
"stagnated." Four out of five manufacturers are struggling to recruit suitably skilled workers, with almost as many 
services companies having similar problems, the BCC said.

TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Apple Sours Markets With iPhone Sales Warning
President Donald Trump and Congressional leaders met at the White House on Wednesday but made no 
meaningful progress toward ending the partial government shutdown. Trump said in a post on Twitter after the 
meeting that Democrats and Republicans must work together to pass a funding bill that protects the nation and its 
people, which he called the "first and most important duty of government." "I remain ready and willing to work with 
Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps 
America Safe. Let's get it done!" Trump tweeted. Despite expressing willingness to work with Democrats, Trump 
continues to stand by his demand that a spending bill include USD5 billion for the construction of controversial 
border wall. In remarks to reporters ahead of the meeting, Trump indicated the partial government shutdown will 
continue for "as long as it takes" to get the money for the wall.
----------
Trump said Wednesday he received "a great letter" from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the New Year's 
holiday. Trump didn't reveal its content but said other people who have read it told him that Kim had never written a 
letter like it. "We really established a very good relationship," Trump said. "A lot of good things are happening." The 
president didn't elaborate except to say that he and Kim will probably have another meeting, but Trump added that 
he is "not in any rush."

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The majority of the European markets ended Thursday's 
session in the red. 
Global growth concerns weighed on investor sentiment after US company Apple lowered its first quarter revenue 
forecast. The lower guidance was attributed to a significantly greater than expected impact from economic 
weakness in some emerging markets.
Disappointing US manufacturing data also contributed to the negative mood among investors. Traders are looking 
ahead to the release of the all important US jobs report on Friday.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened 1.0%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
decreased 1.3%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.6%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 1.6% and the CAC of France fell 1.7%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 0.6%, but 
the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.4%.
Chipmakers were under heavy pressure following the warning from Apple. AMS plunged 23% in Zurich, 
STMicroelectronics sank 12% in Paris and Dialog Semiconductor tumbled 9.7% in Frankfurt.
In Paris, drug giant Sanofi slid 1.0% after it decided not to extend its collaboration with MyoKardia beyond the initial 
research term, which ended on December 31.
In London, fashion retailer Next jumped 4.3%. The company cut its full year profit guidance, but posted strong sales 
in the three weeks prior to Christmas.
Acacia Mining shares advanced 3.9%. The new Barrick Gold Corp is considering options for its stake in the 
company including possible sale, Chief Executive Mark Bristow reportedly said.
Ryanair Holdings lost 1.7% after its passenger traffic increased 12% in December from a year ago.
European Markets Finish Mostly Lower After Apple Revenue Warning
Industrial equipment rental company Ashtead Group fell 2.3%. The company has extended the maturity of its senior 
credit facility to December 2023 and increased it to USD4.1 billion.
British construction sector growth was the weakest in three months in December amid a slower rise in commercial 
work, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday. The CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to 52.8 
from 53.4 in November. The latest reading was in line with economists' expectations.
Partly reflecting favorable weather, payroll processor ADP released a report on Thursday showing much stronger 
than expected US private sector job growth in the month of December. ADP said private sector employment surged 
up by 271,000 jobs in December after climbing by a downwardly revised 157,000 jobs in November.
Economists had expected an increase of about 178,000 jobs compared to the addition of 179,000 jobs originally 
reported for the previous month.
A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a bigger than expected increase in first-time 
claims for US unemployment benefits in the week ended December 29. The report said initial jobless claims 
climbed to 231,000, an increase of 10,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 221,000.
Economists had expected jobless claims to edge up to 220,000 from the 216,000 originally reported for the previous 
month.
Indicating a notable slowdown in the pace of growth in US manufacturing activity in the month of December, the 
Institute for Supply Management released a report on Thursday showing a much bigger than expected drop by its 
index of activity in the manufacturing sector.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index tumbled to 54.1 in December after rising to 59.3 in November, 
slumping its lowest level since hitting 53.4 in November of 2016. While a reading above 50 still indicates growth in 
manufacturing activity, economists had expected the index to show a more modest drop to a reading of 57.9.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The UK Civil Aviation Authority on Wednesday said it started enforcement action 
against Ryanair Holdings PLC, after the budget airline refused to compensate customers affected by a long streak 
of summer strikes. 
The regulator said that passengers who have made claims for compensation directly to the airline have seen them 
be rejected, as Ryanair decided that under European Commission Regulation 261/2004 "financial compensation is 
not payable" with regards to its staff's industrial action. 
The CAA said that passengers have been able to escalate their complaints to AviationADR, a body in charge of 
providing resolutions for complaints. However, the CAA said that Ryanair has now terminated its agreement with 
AviationADR, resulting in the regulator deciding to take action. 
Reiterating its view at the time of the strikes, the CAA said that in its opinion, "the strikes were not "extraordinary 
circumstances" and were not exempt, meaning consumers should be compensated in accordance with Regulation 
EC261/2004".
Ryanair responded in a statement: "Courts in Germany, Spain and Italy have already ruled that strikes are an 
"extraordinary circumstance" and EU261 compensation does not apply. We expect the UK CAA and Courts will 
follow this precedent."
Passengers will have to wait until the outcome of the enforcement action to see whether their disputes are resolved, 
the CAA said Wednesday.
Ryanair shares were trading flat at EUR11.43 on Wednesday.

LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Stagecoach Ups Outlook Despite Interim Loss
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Stagecoach Ups Outlook Despite Interim 
Loss

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are set to open sharply lower on Wednesday following a slump in 
New York overnight that was tracked by Asian markets, with the optimism seen at the start of the week fading. 
In company news, Stagecoach said its interim results were ahead of expectations as it swung to a statutory loss, 
the UK civil aviation regulator has started enforcement action against Ryanair, and Patisserie Holdings has hired a 
new chief financial officer as the cafe chain works "tirelessly" to move on from its accounting scandal.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 50.06 points lower at 6,972.70 on Wednesday. 
The FTSE 100 closed down 39.65 points, or 0.6%, at 7,022.76 on Tuesday.
"Monday's stock market relief rally rather surprisingly ran out of legs fairly quickly yesterday, with some blaming the 
differences over the detail between the US version of what transpired at the weekend and the lack of any detail 
from the Chinese side with which to confirm it," said CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
He added: "This weakness strikes me as being overdone, particularly when you look at recent US data, however 
along with concerns about slowing global growth in China and Europe, along with rising geopolitical risk in Europe 
as well as last night's events in the UK parliament, its perhaps not surprising that investor nerves are a little frayed."
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended deep in the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 3.1%, 
the S&P 500 3.2% and the Nasdaq Composite 3.8%.
In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index ended down 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite 
closed down 0.6%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is 1.7% lower in late trade.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Stagecoach Ups Outlook Despite Interim Loss
The declines came despite positive economic data from China.
The services sector in China continued to expand in November, and at a faster-than-expected pace, data showed. 
The latest survey from Caixin showed a PMI score of 53.8, beating expectations for the reading to be unchanged 
from October's 50.8.
The reading for November continued to rise further above the 50-mark, which indicates expansion in the sector. 
Individually, November marked the steepest increase in services activity in five months, while manufacturing 
production remained stable.
Japan's services PMI for November also remained above the 50-line but weakened from October. The services 
reading of 52.3 was down marginally from 52.4 in October. Individually, business activity continued to grow at a 
solid rate as demand conditions remained supportive. Confidence strengthened to a 10-month peak.
Shareholders of Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical approved the proposed acquisition of Irish drugmaker Shire.
The acquisition remains subject to approval by Shire shareholders at a meeting to be held later on Wednesday. It is 
expected that completion of the acquisition will take place on January 8. The last day of dealings for Shire shares 
on the London Stock Exchange will be Friday, January 4. Shire will be removed from the FTSE 100 index on 
Monday, January 7, according to index provider FTSE Russell.
In other company news, transport operator Stagecoach said adjusted earnings for its half-year were ahead of 
expectations, due to its Virgin Rail operations and a resolution to its former South West Trains franchise, though the 
firm swung to a loss on a statutory basis. 
Revenue for the half-year to October 27 was GBP1.23 billion, down from GBP1.79 billion a year ago, as adjusted 
pretax profit fell to GBP87.0 million from GBP96.7 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 12.9p, down from 
13.6p a year before. 
On a statutory basis, Stagecoach swung to a pretax loss of GBP22.6 million for the half from a GBP96.7 million 
profit last year. 
Operating profit for UK Rail was highlighted as being ahead of forecasts, despite profit for the unit falling 47% to 
GBP11.5 million from GBP21.7 million a year ago. The company said the fall reflected the expiry of the South West 
Trains franchise.
"The group is focused on making further progress in the second half of the year and we have increased our 
expectation of full-year adjusted earnings per share to reflect the above-forecast rail earnings in the first half of the 
year," said Chief Executive Martin Griffiths.
Stagecoach kept its interim dividend unchanged at 3.8 pence per share.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority said it has started enforcement action against Ryanair, following the budget airline's 
decision that compensation is not payable for the flight disruptions caused by industrial action by its staff members 
over the summer. 
Ryanair passengers have made claims for compensation directly to the airline, but these have been rejected, the 
CAA said. Passengers had been able to escalate their complaints to AviationADR, a body approved by the CAA, to 
provide alternative resolutions for these complaints. 
However, Ryanair has now informed the CAA that it has terminated its agreement with AviationADR.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Stagecoach Ups Outlook Despite Interim Loss
CAA reiterated its view at the time of the industrial action that the strikes were not "extraordinary circumstances", 
which means consumers should be compensated in accordance with European Commission Regulation 261/2004.
John Wood Group said it has been awarded at USD43 million contract by a "large-cap midstream company" to 
construct 80 miles of steel pipeline in west Texas. 
Monks Investment Trust said it underperformed the FTSE World Index in its first half, with media investor Naspers 
and financial services firm Prudential among the larger drags on the portfolio. 
Monks Investment said it produced a negative net asset value total return of 0.9% in the six months to October 31, 
compared with a 4.5% increase for the FTSE World Index. Health insurer Anthem and online retail platform Amazon 
were "notable positive contributors" to absolute returns, while Naspers and Prudential dragged. 
Embattled cake maker Patisserie Holdings has appointed former CVS Group Finance Director Nick Perrin as 
interim chief financial officer.
"I am pleased to welcome Nick to Patisserie Holdings. He brings with him the necessary experience to help 
strengthen the team as the company works tirelessly to put the events of the past months behind it and look forward 
to the future," said Chief Executive Steve Francis. 
The cafe chain has been struggling since discovering in October a GBP20 million black hole in its financial accounts 
due to potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities. Former Finance Director Chris Marsh was suspended by the 
company after the irregularities were found. He since was arrested and released on bail. Marsh subsequently 
resigned from Patisserie.
To come in the economic calendar on Wednesday, there are services PMIs from France, Germany, the eurozone 
and the UK at 0850 GMT, 0855 GMT, 0900 GMT and 0930 GMT respectively. There are also eurozone retail sales 
at 1000 GMT.
Markets in the US will be closed on Wednesday in honour of former US President George HW Bush, whose funeral 
is taking place.
In the UK, Theresa May is battling to keep her Brexit agenda on track as MPs are again set to clash over the UK 
prime minister's EU withdrawal plan after inflicting major defeats on the government.
As the Commons prepares for a second of five days of debate on May's controversial Brexit deal on Wednesday, a 
Tory former chief whip broke ranks and said he would vote against the proposals.
Mark Harper, who backed Remain in the referendum, insisted the EU agreement would leave the UK worse off. 
Forecasting that May would lose the crunch Brexit vote next Tuesday by more than 80 votes, Harper urged the PM 
to renegotiate the deal.
The comments came in the wake of a humiliating set of Commons defeats for May which saw the government 
forced to allow MPs to have a say in what happens next if the Brexit deal is voted down next week.
Ministers also had to agree to publish the "final and full" legal advice to Cabinet on the withdrawal agreement as the 
government was found to be in contempt of Parliament for not already doing so.

Theresa May is battling to keep her Brexit agenda on track as MPs are again set to clash over the UK prime 
minister's EU withdrawal plan after inflicting major defeats on the government. As the Commons prepared for a 
second of five days of debate on May's controversial Brexit deal on Wednesday, a Tory former chief whip broke 
ranks and said he would vote against the proposals. Mark Harper, who backed Remain in the referendum, insisted 
the EU agreement would leave the UK worse off. Forecasting that May would lose the crunch Brexit vote next 
LONDON BRIEFING: UK Regulator Takes Enforcement Action Against Ryanair
Tuesday by more than 80 votes, Harper urged the PM to renegotiate the deal. The comments came in the wake of 
a humiliating set of Commons defeats for May which saw the government forced to allow MPs to have a say in what 
happens next if the Brexit deal is voted down on Tuesday. Ministers also had to agree to publish the "final and full" 
legal advice to Cabinet on the withdrawal agreement as the government was found to be in contempt of Parliament 
for not already doing so.

The services sector in China continued to expand in November, and at a greatly accelerated rate, the latest survey 
from Caixin revealed with a PMI score of 53.8. That beat expectations for 50.8, which would have been unchanged 
from the October reading. It also moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from 
contraction. Also, the composite index jumped to 51.9 in November, up from 50.5 a month earlier.

The services sector in Japan continued to expand in November, albeit at a fractionally slower pace, the latest 
survey from Nikkei showed with a PMI score of 52.3. That's down from 52.4 in October, although it remains well 
above the line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. The composite index eased to 52.4 in November 
from 52.5 in October.

US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he is open to extending the deadline for tariff negotiations under way 
between the US and China. Trump said that he set a 90-day deadline for the talks when he and Chinese President 
Xi Jinping met over the weekend at a dinner meeting during the G20 summit. "The negotiations with China have 
already started," Trump tweeted. "Unless extended, they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very 
warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina." Trump announced after the meeting that no new tariffs would be added 
for 90 days, averting a further escalation of a trade war. In return, China pledged to increase imports from the US to 
reduce a trade imbalance. US negotiators are exploring whether a "REAL deal" can be reached, Trump said. He 
and Xi want the deal to happen and it "probably will", he tweeted. But if not, "Remember, I am a Tariff Man," he 
said.

BT Group will strip Huawei Technologies Co's equipment from its core 4G network as government pressure to 
boycott the Chinese firm mounts, the Financial Times reported. BT's decision will bring its mobile network in line 
with an internal policy designed to keep the Chinese firm out of its telecoms infrastructure, the FT said. BT will, 
within two years, remove Huawei's technology from unit EE's network, which relied on the Chinese firm's kit to build 
its 3G and 4G network. World governments have started to become wary of Huawei, with the US, Australia and 
New Zealand blocking the use of the Chinese company's 5G equipment on "security grounds", as they are afraid of 
possible interference by China, the newspaper noted.

Transport operator Stagecoach said adjusted earnings for its half-year were ahead of expectations, due to its Virgin 
Rail operations and a resolution to its former South West Trains franchise, though the firm swung to a loss on a 
statutory basis. Revenue for the half-year to October 27 was GBP1.23 billion, down from GBP1.79 billion a year 
ago, as adjusted pretax profit fell to GBP87.0 million from GBP96.7 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 
12.9p, down from 13.6p a year before. On a statutory basis, Stagecoach swung to a pretax loss of GBP22.6 million 
for the half from a GBP96.7 million profit last year. Operating profit for UK Rail was highlighted as being ahead of 
forecasts, despite profit for the unit falling 47% to GBP11.5 million from GBP21.7 million a year ago. The company 
said the fall reflected the expiry of the South West Trains franchise. "The group is focused on making further 
progress in the second half of the year and we have increased our expectation of full-year adjusted earnings per 
share to reflect the above-forecast rail earnings in the first half of the year," said Chief Executive Martin Griffiths. 
Stagecoach kept its interim dividend unchanged at 3.8 pence per share.

months behind it and look forward to the future," said Chief Executive Steve Francis. The cafe chain has been 
struggling since discovering in October a GBP20 million black hole in its financial accounts due to potentially 
fraudulent accounting irregularities. Former Finance Director Chris Marsh was suspended by the company after the 
irregularities were found. He since was arrested and released on bail. Marsh subsequently resigned from

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.

The UK Civil Aviation Authority said it started enforcement action against Ryanair Holdings, after the budget airline 
refused to compensate customers affected by a long streak of summer strikes. The regulator said passengers who 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Government To Publish Full Brexit Legal Advice
have made claims for compensation directly to the airline have seen them be rejected, as Ryanair decided under 
European Commission Regulation 261/2004 "financial compensation is not payable" with regards to its staff's 
industrial action. The CAA said passengers have been able to escalate their complaints to AviationADR, a body in 
charge of providing resolutions for complaints. However, the CAA said that Ryanair has now terminated its 
agreement with AviationADR, resulting in the regulator deciding to take action. Ryanair responded in a statement: 
"Courts in Germany, Spain and Italy have already ruled that strikes are an "extraordinary circumstance" and EU261 
compensation does not apply. We expect the UK CAA and Courts will follow this precedent."
----------
Stagecoach Group said it swung to a loss in the first half of its current financial year, but adjusted earnings were 
ahead of expectations. The transport operator swung to a pretax loss of GBP22.6 million in the six months to 
October 27 from GBP96.7 million profit reported for the same period a year earlier. Adjusted pretax profit declined 
by 10% to GBP87.0 million from GBP96.7 million year-on-year. The result was hurt by lower revenue, which fell by 
a third to GBP1.23 billion from GBP1.79 billion year-on-year due to the expiry of South West Trains franchise in 
August last year and the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise in June. Revenue in the UK Rail division was down 
63% to GBP335.1 million from GBP899.2 million year-on-year. Like-for-like revenue, which includes East Midlands 
Trains and Sheffield Supertram businesses, rose by 0.4% to GBP202.1 million from GBP201.3 million. Stagecoach 
maintained its interim payout at 3.8 pence a share. 
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were sharply lower amid trade concerns and fears over a possible slowdown in the US economy 
after the US Treasury curve inverted for the first time in more than a decade. The pound was flat against the dollar 
after disappointing UK services PMI data. Oil prices rose ahead of the OPEC meeting on Thursday. Financial 
markets in the US are closed for the funeral of former president George HW Bush.

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Output in the UK's dominant services sector slumped to its lowest level since the Brexit vote in November as the 
country's EU divorce continues to drag on the economy. The closely watched IHS Markit/CIPS UK services 
purchasing managers' index showed a reading of 50.4 last month. This was lower than the 52.2 recorded in 
October and below the 52.2 reading economists were expecting. A figure above 50 indicates growth. November 
saw the worst performance since July 2016, when business sagged following the result of the referendum on 
Britain's membership of the EU. Excluding July 2016, it was also the worst performance since February 2013. The 
survey suggests that Brexit anxiety has weighed on business activity and sentiment with companies more risk 
averse when making spending and investment plans following reports that Britain could crash out of the EU with no 
deal.
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal will face fresh scrutiny when the Cabinet's full legal advice is 
published, following one of the most punishing days in the Commons for a sitting government in recent memory. 
Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the advice on the Withdrawal Agreement from Attorney General Geoffrey 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Government To Publish Full Brexit Legal Advice
Cox would be published on Wednesday morning, after MPs on Tuesday found the government to be in contempt of 
Parliament for the first time in modern history. Wednesday is the second of five days of debates on the deal before 
the December 11 vote, and follows a first day which saw a series of dramatic defeats for the prime minister's 
struggling administration. As well as losing the contempt vote, the government was also forced to allow MPs to 
have a say in what happens next if the Brexit deal is voted down on Tuesday. Leadsom told BBC Radio 4's Today 
programme that the government would release the legal advice, but "not without some regret".
----------
Fewer than four in 10 Britons, or 38%, now think the UK was right to vote for Brexit, while almost half, 49%, believe 
it was the wrong decision. The 11% gap is the widest recorded by pollsters YouGov in a regular series of monthly 
surveys for the Times, while the number believing Brexit was right is at its lowest and those seeing it as wrong at its 
highest. Virtually every poll in the sequence since the summer of 2017 has found a majority believing that the wrong 
decision was made in the EU referendum of 2016. The results came as MPs were embroiled in five days of debate 
over the EU withdrawal deal reached by the prime minister in Brussels last month. The poll found just 23% of those 
questioned support May's Brexit deal, against 46% who oppose it.
----------
Demand for new cars fell by 3.0% in the UK last month, figures show. Some 158,600 new cars were registered in 
November compared with 163,500 during the same month in 2017, the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders 
said. Registrations are down 6.9% this year compared with the first 11 months of last year. Sales of petrol models 
increased by 3.5% last month, while diesels fell 17%. Demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and 
pure electrics increased by 25% to take a market share of 6.8%.
----------
The services sector in China continued to expand in November, and at a greatly accelerated rate, the latest survey 
from Caixin revealed with a PMI score of 53.8. That beat expectations for 50.8, which would have been unchanged 
from the October reading. It also moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from 
contraction. Also, the composite index jumped to 51.9 in November, up from 50.5 a month earlier.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday reported 
a rise in passenger traffic in November, compared to a year before, while Ryanair said it signed a labour agreement 
in Germany.
Ryanair said group traffic rose by 11% to 10.4 million from 9.3 million reported in October last year. The result 
includes 300,000 passengers carried by Laudamotion. 
In July, Ryanair acquired the remaining 75% interest in Austrian airline Laudamotion GmbH.
Excluding Laudamotion, Ryanair's traffic grew 8.6% to 10.1 million customers in November. 
The result was helped by lower fares and the successful launch of its Winter schedules, Ryanair said.
Ryanair's load factor remained unchanged year-on-year at 96%. 
"We operated over 56,000 scheduled flights in November with over 88% of flights arriving on time, as Ryanair 
continues to deliver the lowest fares, with the best punctuality of any major EU airline," said Ryanair Chief 
Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs. 
In addition, Ryanair said it signed an agreement with the German pilot union VC, which will deliver basic pay 
increases and apply German labour law for all Ryanair's German-based pilots. 
The four-year deal covers pay, pension and pilot allowances and includes seniority, annual leave and base transfer 
systems benefits. 
Separately, rival Wizz Air said it continued to grow its network, enhance its operations and improve its customer 
offering.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair And Wizz Air Report Passenger Growth In November
As a result, the airline increased capacity, measured in available seat kilometres, by 7.7% to 2.6 million from 2.4 
million a year prior. Load factor advanced by 2.9 percentage points to 91.2% from 88.3%.
Wizz Air carried a total number of 2.4 million passengers in November, which was up 11% year-on-year from 2.2 
million. The group's traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, rose by 14% to 3.9 million from 3.5 million 
reported in November last year.
For the 12 months to November-end, passenger numbers improved by 20% to 33.4 million, with capacity increasing 
by 19% to 36.2 million. Load factor was 0.9 percentage point higher at 92.3%.
Looking ahead, Wizz Air said it is planning a fleet expansion with the delivery of an additional new Airbus A321, 
which will take its fleet to 105 aircraft. 
Ryanair shares were up 0.3% at EUR11.68 each on Monday, while Wizz Air shares were 2.8% lower  at 2,902.00 
pence each.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets ended Tuesday's session in the red. 
Following yesterday's rally, investors took an opportunity to lock in some profits. Traders reacted positively to the 
trade war truce reached by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit over the 
weekend.
However, uncertainty about whether the 90-day truce will give the US and China enough time to reach a long-term 
trade agreement appears to have inspired traders to cash in on Monday's strong upward move.
News that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, one of Trump's more hawkish advisors on trade with China, 
has been tapped to lead the negotiations has added to the skepticism.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened 0.8%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
decreased 0.8%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.4%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 1.1% and the CAC of France fell 0.8%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 0.6% and 
the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.2%.
In Paris, JCDecaux sank 2.9% after a brokerage downgrade.
In London, low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings fell 1.8% after reporting positive traffic figures for November.
Ferguson, a specialist distributor of plumbing and heating products, tumbled 4.3% despite the company posting 
solid first-quarter results.
IG Group Holdings sank 9.7% after the online trading company said it expects revenue in the first half to be around 
6.0% lower than last year.
European Markets Down On Profit Taking And Trade War Uncertainty
Danske Bank AS slid 0.1% in Copenhagen. The bank said it has built a capital buffer of as much as USD2.7 billion 
to absorb potential fines in a money laundering case.
Eurozone producer price inflation accelerated further in October, defying expectations, figures from Eurostat 
showed Tuesday. Producer prices rose 4.9% year-on-year after a revised 4.6% in September. Economists had 
expected the rate to remain unchanged at September's original figure of 4.5%.
British construction sector expanded at the fastest pace in four months in November, thanks to an increase in new 
work and consequent gains in job creation, though Brexit concerns damped expectations for the months ahead.
The CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 53.4 from 53.2 in October, survey data from IHS 
Markit showed on Tuesday. Economists had forecast a score of 52.5.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stobart Group Ltd said Monday it intends to reduce its fourth-quarter dividend - 
resulting in a lower total dividend - to invest in "value-creating opportunities" and maintain a "strong" balance sheet.
The infrastructure and support services company - which owns Southend airport - will reduce its fourth-quarter 
dividend to 1.5 pence from 4.5p in the same period last year. 
As a result, Stobart Group said it will pay a total dividend of 15p in the current financial year, down from 16.5p it 
said on Monday it had paid in the previous financial year.  
The company also said it has continued its growth plans for Stobart Aviation and Stobart Energy with trading in the 
second half in line with expectations.
The commercial agreements signed by Southend airport with Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC give the 
company confidence it will record "significantly" increased passenger numbers from next year.
Stobart Group said it is targeting 5 million passengers from 2022 at GBP10 earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation per passenger.
The company is currently undergoing a "detailed capital review" and intends to update the market on the results 
with its pre-closing trading statement in March 2019.
Shares in Stobart Group were down 8.1% Monday morning at 181.60 pence each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Furious passengers blasted budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC for slapping them with 
GBP55 fees for not being able to check-in online after its website crashed.
Jetsetters took to social media to vent their anger with the budget airline on Monday night when they could not 
access its website for hours.
Some were left fuming when they could not book flights, but others barraged the airline with complaints that they 
had been handed late fees for not checking-in in advance.
One user @TotallydubbedHD said he was handed a bill for an extra GBP110 for late check-ins on two GBP46 
return flights.
The YouTube technology reviewer and blogger tweeted at about 5.20pm London time that the firm's customer 
service refused to acknowledge the website was down.
He added: "Was charged GBP55/pp (on a @Ryanair flight that cost GBP46/pp return).
"Customer service, both online and on the phone, refused to acknowledge the website being down and/or having 
the ability to check in online."
Another user @HeatherMatthews said she was also hit with a GBP55 fine at Liverpool for not being able to check in 
online.
She added: "Charged GBP55 fee at Liverpool airport due to not being able to check in because Ryanair website 
was down.
"Tried to use the online complaint form and this is showing an error message too. What do I do? @Ryanair."
Passengers Voice Fury Over Fines Caused By Ryanair's Website Crashing
Other users questioned whether Ryanair would charge people the fine even though its website and app were not 
working.
@dorianlj10 said: "@Ryanair Any chance of you sorting out your website and app? Surely you can't be charging a 
check in fee tomorrow!"
But some users said they would not be paying any fines. @RyanRolph_Tryka said: "@Ryanair great work, GBP55 
fee for not checking in online… website crashes, app down and no way to check-in… safe to say i WILL NOT be 
paying upon check-in tomorrow if you try and charge me for it!!"
The budget airline told the Press Association at about 9pm that its website was working normally, following a "brief" 
server issue.
A spokesman added: "The website is working normally. There was a brief server issue earlier this evening which 
was quickly resolved."
But when the PA checked the site it was still saying the site was "down for maintenance", and it was still not 
working at 10.20pm.

Theresa May's DUP allies have delivered a warning shot across the bows after accusing the UK prime minister of 
breaking fundamental promises on Brexit. The party joined with Labour to cut the government's majority to just five 
in a Commons vote on the Budget. They also abstained on a series of other amendments to the Finance Bill on 
Monday night in a move intended to send a "political message" to May. Their actions appeared to call into question 
the future of the "confidence and supply" arrangement by which the DUP props up May's minority Conservative 
Government. Under the terms of the deal, agreed after May lost her Commons majority in last year's general 
election, the Northern Ireland party is supposed to back the government on Budget matters and on confidence 
votes. But DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said May's deal with Brussels breached a "fundamental" 
assurance that Northern Ireland would not be separated constitutionally or economically from the rest of the UK.

Negotiators from EU member states failed to reach an agreement over the 2019 eurozone budget by the deadline 
of midnight on Monday, ensuring that further discussions will have to be scheduled in coming weeks. The budget 
covers everything from agricultural subsidies and support for poorer regions to research and education 
programmes. Most money flows back to member states. The European Commission is now required to submit a 
fresh proposal for talks later this month or early in December, according to a spokesperson for the Austrian 
government, which holds the rotating EU presidency through December.

Three US senators challenged the appointment of Matthew Whitaker to the job of acting attorney general in a 
lawsuit that claims the appointment is unconstitutional. The senators say the appointment violates the US 
Constitution's clause on the appointment process, specifically the requirement that the US Senate provide "advice 
and consent" on presidential appointments for principal federal offices. In their 17-page complaint filed in US District 
Court in Washington they say he cannot be appointed because the US Senate did not confirm him to his prior post. 
Whitaker was chief of staff under former attorney general Jeff Sessions.

Catering firm Compass Group said it had a strong year with healthy revenue growth, driven by an excellent 
performance in North America, an acceleration in Europe and good progress in Rest of World. For the financial year 
ended September 30, revenue increased 1.7% to GBP22.96 billion from GBP22.57 billion last year and operating 
profit rose to GBP1.69 billion from GBP1.67 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 5.5% to GBP23.24 billion 
from GBP21.84 billion last year and operating profit was up 7.1% to GBP1.74 billion from GBP1.63 billion. The 
company-supplied consensus also had expected underlying profit of GBP1.74 billion. The company's underlying 
operating margin remained flat at 7.4%. Compass noted statutory basis earnings were lower than underlying results 
mainly due to the adverse foreign exchange movements during the year. Compass reported that annual underlying 
organic revenue growth was 5.5%, accelerating from 4.0% last year. This beat the company-supplied consensus 
estimate of 5.3%. The company raised its annual dividend 13% to 37.7p from 33.5p last year.

French bank Societe Generale has agreed to pay some USD1.34 billion in fines for "unsafe and unsound practices" 
regarding violations of sanctions on Cuba, the US Federal Reserve said. The Federal Reserve said it "fined Societe 
Generale for having insufficient policies and procedures to ensure that the activities conducted at its offices outside 
of the US complied with US sanctions laws". The measures against the bank were largely expected. The bank said 
in September that it was in intense dialogue with US officials. The fine comes on top of other scandals involving the 
bank, including the fixing of the Libor rate, the interest-rate benchmark. The bank also settled a probe into its 
dealings in Libya.

IN THE KNOW: Wizz Air Still Berenberg Top Pick Despite Profit Warning
IN THE KNOW: Wizz Air Still Berenberg Top Pick Despite Profit Warning

LONDON (Alliance News) - Berenberg on Monday reduced its annual targets for Wizz Air, but said the airline 
remains its Top Pick and maintained its Buy recommendation. 
FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air previously expected net profit for the year to the end of March 2019 to be in the range of 
EUR310 million to EUR340 million.
However, last Wednesday, this has been reduced to between EUR270 million and EUR300 million as a result of 
higher fuel price and disruptions in summer, with the cancellation of 251 flights by the budget airline.
For the six months to the end of September, Wizz Air reported a pretax profit of EUR295.5 million, down 1.7% from 
EUR300.7 million a year before, as fuel costs rose by 43% to EUR349.5 million and staff costs were 36% higher, at 
EUR98.7 million. 
"With Wizz Air's expected guidance cut now behind it, investors can refocus on the positive
near-term and long-term fundamentals offering share price upside," said Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik.
The broker believes that Wizz Air is more insulated than its peers as more than half of its capacity is operating 
without market competition. As a result, Berenberg expects over 3% revenue per available seat kilometres growth 
in financial 2020, which is in line with peer low-cost airline Ryanair and above easyJet. 
In the half-year report, Wizz Air said it aims to deliver another year of profitable growth in financial 2020, adding 
around 15% of additional seat to its markets. The company's unit costs are expected to decline on the significant 
benefits of the A321 NEO aircraft. Wizz Air said it plans to operate 12 A321 NEO aircraft by the end of the financial 
year.
These larger and well-priced aircraft operate game-changing technology that burn at least 16% less fuel compared 
to Wizz Air's existing technology and have a potential to deliver 20% lower unit costs when compared to the A320 
CEO aircraft. 
IN THE KNOW: Wizz Air Still Berenberg Top Pick Despite Profit Warning
As a result, Berenberg concluded that new leases offer cost savings of USD1.5 million per aircraft per year, up from 
previously calculated USD1 million savings. 
Although the broker lowered its estimates for financial 2019, capacity discipline drove up its financial 2020 and 2021 
forecasts. 
For financial 2019, Berenberg cut Wizz Air's sales estimates by 1.5% to EUR2.35 billion and adjusted net profit 
estimate by EUR15 million to EUR296 million. 
More positively, Berenberg upped its adjusted net profit target for financial 2020 by 4% to EUR359 million. Sales 
estimate remained unchanged at EUR2.79 billion.
The broker said Wizz Air offers clearer growth prospects at higher earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, 
amortization, and restructuring or rent costs margins compared with Ryanair.
Thus Berenberg reiterated its Buy recommendation and 3,800 pence a share price target.
Wizz Air shares were trading 1.6% lower on Monday at 2,908.00p each and the stock is down 22% so far in 2018.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair has paid EUR525,000 in subsidies back to French authorities to end a tarmac 
stand-off that forced 149 passengers to disembark from an impounded plane.
The French civil aviation authority said it had seized the plane at Bordeaux-Merignac airport as a "last resort" after 
France repeatedly tried to get Ryanair to pay back regional funds to the airline in 2008/09.
The European Commission later ruled those funds illegal, saying they gave Ryanair an unfair economic advantage.
The aviation authority called it "regrettable the state was forced" to evacuate the plane on Thursday. It said the 
passengers were put on another Ryanair flight five hours later.
Ryanair did not publicly comment on the seizure.
Aviation authority spokesman Eric Heraud said the airline had paid back the funds and the plane would be 
released.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it has signed a collective 
labour agreement framework and social plan with Ver.di, the German cabin crew union.
The agreement covers all of Ryanair's German based cabin crew and confirms the application of German labour 
law to Ryanair's cabin crew. It also delivers pay increases and other benefits for all Ryanair German based cabin 
crew over the next two years.
"We are pleased to sign this collective labour agreement agreement with Ver.di, which will lead to pay 
improvements and other benefits for our German based cabin crew, subject to them voting in favour of this 
agreement over the coming week," said Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson.
"This follows a very successful collective labour agreement ballot in Italy and recent cabin crew recognition 
agreements in Greece and Sweden," added Wilson. 
In addition, Ryanair said its Italian cabin crew have voted overwhelmingly in favour of the cabin crew union 
recognition agreement, signed recently between Ryanair and the three main cabin crew unions in Italy. The main 
three cabin crew unions in Italy are ANPAV, ANPAC, and FIT CISL.
Under the pact, pay and benefits improvements will now apply to all of Ryanair's cabin crew in Italy for the next 
three years.
The airline said it signed new recognition agreements with cabin crew unions in Greece and Sweden over the past 
week. Ryanair now intends to work with these unions on long-term collective labour agreements to cover cabin 
crew in Greece and Sweden.
Ryanair shares were trading 1.0% lower on Thursday at EUR12.85 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is to operate 11 new routes from Edinburgh Airport beginning in 
summer 2019.
A service to Luxembourg and Billund in Denmark will run all year through while new summer routes include Lisbon, 
Stockholm and Tallinn.
The low-cost airline said its 58 routes would deliver 3.5 million passengers through Edinburgh Airport next year.
A spokesman said: "We will also base an additional aircraft at Edinburgh as we continue to grow traffic, routes, 
tourism and jobs."
The other new routes are Berlin, Derry, Memmingen, Riga, Seville and Sofia.
Meanwhile, British Airways has announced an expansion of its Inverness to Heathrow service.
The airline will operate two daily return services from Monday to Friday and three return services at weekends from 
next summer.
The route from London to the Highland capital was reinstated in 2016.
The expanded schedule means business people will be able to travel between the two cities and complete a full 
working day before returning home the same day.
BA said it had been able to increase flights to Inverness because the hub, run by Highlands and Islands Airports, is 
exempt from air passenger duty.
Phyllis Stuart, British Airways' airport manager in Inverness, said: "Since we reintroduced the daily service between 
Inverness and Heathrow we have seen steady growth in passenger numbers at both ends of the route and this

further expansion is testament to the support our partners at Inverness Airport, and the people and business 
community of the Highlands and Islands, have given us over the past two years.
"The new schedule will bring greater economic benefits to the region and the extra flights on Saturdays and 
Sundays will cater for the number of leisure passengers travelling to the Highlands and Islands during the summer 
months."

NEW YORK (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC and its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, 
are being sued for allegedly providing misleading information to investors on the company's relations with some 
workers.
A pension fund in Alabama accuses Ryanair of deceiving investors about conflicts with pilots and other employees, 
which caused clear losses in the company's stock market value, according to a complaint lodged at a New York 
court.
Ryanair rejected the accusations levelled against it on Wednesday, saying that the "claims are doomed to fail as 
they have no basis in fact or reality".
The pension fund is seeking compensation for damages due to the decline in share prices. It wants to pursue the 
case as a class action lawsuit, hoping that other investors will follow suit.
It remains to be seen whether the court will approve or throw out the legal complaint.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a rise in October passenger traffic despite 
over 300 flight cancellations due to bad weather, strikes and ATC staff shortages.
The Irish low-cost airline reported 11% rise in traffic, including Lauda, to 13.1 million for October, up from 11.8 
million the year before. Load factor for the month remained flat year-on-year at 96%.
On a month-on month basis, traffic remained flat, while load factor dipped by one percentage point from 97% in 
September.
"Ryanair's Oct traffic (which includes Lauda) grew by 11% to 13.1 million customers, due to lower fares and 
continuing success of Lauda's summer schedule. During October, we were forced to cancel just over 300 flights 
because of a five day airport handler strike at Brussels Zaventem, some adverse weather (winter storms) and 
continuing ATC staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France," said Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs. 
"We operated over 71,400 scheduled flights with over 80% of these flights arriving on time, as Ryanair continues to 
deliver the lowest fares, with the best punctuality of any major EU airline," Jacobs added.

Micro Focus International extended its share buyback programme as it reported the departure of its finance head. 
The business software company appointed Brian McArthur-Muscroft to replace current Chief Financial Officer Chris 
Kennedy, who will be leaving in the first quarter of 2019 to join broadcaster ITV. McArthur-Muscroft is currently a 
senior independent director at recruitment firm Robert Walters. Previously he has served as CFO at telecom firm 
TeleCity Group and online payments company Paysafe Group. The company also announced its intention to 
recommence its share buyback programme, with any shares bought back to be held in treasury. In addition, Micro 
Focus highlighted that it traded in line with the board's expectations in the year to the end of October, as it saw 
revenue improvements in the second half. On a constant currency basis, the company expects revenue to come in

Hiscox said it enjoyed "strong" growth in an "active" third quarter which saw the insurer's total gross written 
premiums increase, as it prepares for Brexit with its European subsidiary expected to start writing business from 
next year. For the nine months ended September, Hiscox reported a 14% year-on-year increase in total gross 
written premiums to USD3.04 billion from USD2.66 billion. "We have had strong growth, but as the market remains 
challenging, we will remain disciplined, and I expect our growth to moderate over the balance of the year. It has 
been an active third quarter for claims across the group, both from large losses and catastrophes, and I am pleased 
with how we have responded," said Chief Executive Bronek Masojada. Hiscox said both natural catastrophe and 
large claims increased in the third quarter after a "benign" first half. In particular, the company said catastrophes in 
the US and Far East represented a "more active environment".

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK service sector registered the slowest rate of expansion since March, survey results from IHS Markit and 
Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply showed. The Purchasing Managers' Index dropped by more than 
expected to 52.2 in October from 53.9 in September. The expected level was 53.4. Although the headline index has 
remained above the 50.0 no-change value in each of the past 27 months, the latest reading was the second lowest 
since July 2016. Respondents noted that heightened economic uncertainty and a soft patch for new work had held 
back business activity growth. It was the weakest rate of expansion since March, when the 'Beast from the East' 
snowstorm sent a chill over the sector, and the second lowest since July 2016.
----------
Ireland's service sector expanded at the slowest pace since March amid a slowdown in new order growth and 
strong inflationary pressures, data from IHS Markit showed. The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 57.2 in 
October from 58.7 in September. The pace of expansion was the weakest in seven months. The composite output 
index posted 56.1 in October, down from 58.4 in September. Nonetheless, any reading above 50 indicates 
expansion in the sector.
----------
China's private sector expanded at the weakest pace in more than two years in October with both services and 
manufacturing noting weaker performances, survey results from IHS Markit showed. The Caixin composite output 
index fell to a 28-month low of 50.5 in October from 52.1 in September. Service sector activity rose only marginally, 
with the Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a 13-month low of 50.8 from 53.1 in September. 
Meanwhile, manufacturing production stagnated, following increases in each of the preceding 27 months.

policy, explicitly oppose protectionism and unilateralism and strive to enhance the level of opening up". "Openness

brings progress, while seclusion leads to backwardness," Xi said in his keynote speech at the China International 
Import Expo in Shanghai.
----------
Former UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson has denounced a mooted Brexit deal with the EU as an "absolute 
stinker" and urged MPs to reject it. The Brexit figurehead was responding to reports that Prime Minister Theresa 
May is close to striking a deal with Brussels which would allow the creation of a whole-UK customs union, avoiding 
the need for the Northern Ireland border "backstop" that has been at the heart of the impasse in negotiations. 
Cabinet minister James Brokenshire rejected suggestions that final agreement has been reached, saying 
negotiations are "still very firmly continuing", with 95% of issues resolved. May is expected to brief the Cabinet on 
progress in talks when members gather for their weekly meeting at 10 Downing Street on Tuesday.
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has reportedly secured a deal that will allow the UK to remain in the customs union 
after Brexit and avoid a hard Irish border, resolving the biggest stumbling block in negotiations with the EU. A 
government spokesman in London, however, described as "speculation" the Sunday Times report which claimed 
May had made concessions to Brussels to resolve the so-called Irish question. The spokesman merely told dpa that 
"good progress" had been made in the negotiations. London and Brussels are currently at odds over how to prevent 
the return of a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will leave the EU with 
Britain at the end of March 2019. The Times reported that according to the deal, remaining in the EU customs union 
will only be temporary. May is planning to discuss the plan with cabinet on Tuesday, the newspaper added.
----------
The annual Confederation of British Industry/Pearson education and skills report showed two-thirds of businesses 
are worried there is a lack of skilled workers to fill their vacancies. This concern comes as more than three-quarters 
of businesses, 79%, expect to increase the number of higher-skilled roles over the coming years. The report 
represents 28,000 businesses and showed 85% of firms are expecting to maintain or increase investment in 
training in their workforce.
----------
Iran has greeted the re-imposition of US sanctions with air defence drills and an acknowledgement from President 
Hassan Rouhani that the nation faces an "economic war" and will be "proud to break" the sanctions. "We are in an 
economic war and with unity and joint efforts against the hostile enemy [the US], we can master this crisis as well," 
Rowhani said to reporters on Monday. He also added that Iran would continue to sell oil despite the sanctions. "We 
are proud to break the sanctions because these sanctions are illegal and unfair and against UN resolutions. 
Therefore all countries should break these sanctions," he said. The US move has raised tensions in the Middle East 
as America's maximalist approach to the Islamic Republic takes hold.
----------
The White House sent conflicting messages on Friday about the prospect of a trade deal with China, with US 
markets reacting negatively to concerns over whether an agreement can soon be reached and tariffs lifted. 
President Donald Trump's key economic adviser said the US is not on the verge of inking a trade deal with Beijing. 
However, the president himself later told a campaign rally in West Virginia that an agreement was likely. The 
leaders of the world's two largest economies are set to meet next month in Argentina on the sidelines of the G-20

earlier told CNBC, sending markets lower.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are seen opening marginally lower on Monday, tracking Asian 
markets lower, as the US downplayed hopes of an imminent trade deal with China.
Enterprise software firm Micro Focus said its decline in annual revenue is expected to be at the better end of its 
previously guided range and it extended its share buyback programme, while also announcing the departure of its 
chief financial officer to broadcaster ITV. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open down 4.02 points at 7,090.10. The blue chip index closed 0.4% 
lower, or 20.54 points, at 7,094.12 on Friday. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.5%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 2.1%.
Asian stocks were lower on trade concerns after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow downplayed the 
potential for a quick trade deal between the US and China.
In early UK corporate news, Micro Focus International said trading has been in line with the company's 
expectations, with an "improved revenue trajectory" in the second half of the year.
The software firm said that, at constant currency, revenue will be around the upper end of the guidance of 6% to 9% 
decline for the financial year to the end of October, which was reiterated at the interim results in July.
Micro Focus said it will return a further USD229 million to shareholders via an extension of its share buyback 
programme.

Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Chris Kennedy will leave the company to join broadcaster ITV in the same role in 
first quarter of 2019. Micro Focus has appointed former Paysafe Group CFO as its new CFO, joining the company 
this month.
Ryanair Holdings said that in October traffic grew 11% to 13.1 million passengers from 11.8 million at the same time 
last year. The Irish carrier reported a 96% load factor for October, which is up from 95% a year before. 
"During October, we were forced to cancel just over 300 flights because of a five day airport handler strike at 
Brussels Zaventem, some adverse weather and continuing ATC staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France. 
We operated over 71,400 scheduled flights with over 80% of these flights arriving on time," Chief Marketing Officer 
Kenny Jacobs said. 
FTSE 250-listed outsourcer Capita said it completed the sale of its parking management business, ParkingEye, to 
Macquarie Principal Finance for GBP235 million.
FTSE 250-listed RPC Group said it extended the deadline for private equity firms Apollo Global Management and 
Bain Capital to make a firm offer for the plastic products maker to December 3. 
In economic news, China's private sector expanded at the weakest pace in more than two years in October with 
both services and manufacturing noting weaker performances, survey results from IHS Markit showed Monday.
The Caixin composite output index fell to a 28-month low of 50.5 in October from 52.1 in September. Service sector 
activity rose only marginally. The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a 13-month low of 50.8 from 
53.1 in September. Meanwhile, manufacturing production stagnated, following increases in each of the preceding 
27 months.
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4%, S&P 500 down 
0.6% Nasdaq Composite down 1.0%. 
The US focus this week will be the US midterm elections on Tuesday and the US Federal Reserve's latest 
monetary policy decision, due on Thursday.
"The headline risk this week is the US mid-term elections, where the Democrats are widely expected to flip the 
House of Representatives. The resultant political deadlock could weigh on US indices and the dollar alike. This is a 
huge risk event for the market. We expecting to see investors selling out of positions and taking risk off the table 
ahead of the midterm elections," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler.
In addition, the Fed is due to announce its interest rate decision on Thursday. The US central bank is widely 
expected to leave rates unchanged, although the accompanying statement may provide clues about the anticipated 
rate hike next month. 
The pound was higher quoted at USD1.3006 early Monday against USD1.2964 at the London equities close Friday. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has reportedly secured a deal that will allow Britain to remain in the customs union 
after Brexit and avoid a hard Irish border, resolving the biggest stumbling block in negotiations with the EU.
A government spokesman in London, however, described as "speculation" the Sunday Times report which claimed 
May had made concessions to Brussels to resolve the so-called Irish question.
The spokesman merely told dpa that "good progress" had been made in the negotiations.

London and Brussels are currently at odds over how to prevent the return of a hard border between the Republic of 
Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will leave the EU with Britain at the end of March 2019.
The Times reported that according to the deal, remaining in the EU customs union will only be temporary. May is 
planning to discuss the plan with cabinet on Tuesday, the newspaper added.
The economic events calendar on Monday has services PMI readings from the UK at 0930 GMT and US at 1445 
GMT.

Ryanair Changes Luggage Rules For 2nd Time In Year, Adding New Charge
Ryanair Changes Luggage Rules For 2nd Time In Year, Adding New Charge
Alliance News

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has changed its hand luggage rules for the second time this 
year.
From Thursday, the Dublin-based airline introduced charges for passengers flying with a small suitcase.
It said the measure is necessary to reduce delays.
In January, Ryanair began a policy which saw passengers who had not bought priority boarding permitted to take a 
"personal bag" – such as a handbag – on board while a second, larger bag – such as a wheelie suitcase weighing 
up to 10kg – could be put in the hold free of charge.
But this resulted in up to 120 bags being tagged at boarding gates for each flight, meaning departures were 
disrupted.
Ryanair has responded by no longer allowing any luggage in the hold free of charge.
Passengers have to pay GBP8 to check in a 10kg bag. The previous lowest price for checked luggage was GBP25 
for up to 20kg, which remains an option for those with heavier cases.
The maximum size of "personal bags" allowed on board has been increased by 40%.
Passengers who pay for priority boarding – which costs GBP6 – will continue to be allowed to take both a "personal 
bag" and small suitcase as hand baggage.
Ryanair believes some customers may prefer the GBP8 checked luggage option because they do not want to drag 
a wheelie case through airport security.
It claimed most passengers will be unaffected by the changes, as 30% already buy priority boarding and a further 
30% travel with only a "personal bag".
Ryanair Changes Luggage Rules For 2nd Time In Year, Adding New Charge
A statement on the airline's website read: "Main benefits of this new policy will be reduced flight delays and cheaper 
checked bag option. Pack more liquids into a 10kg checked wheelie bag. Walk to the boarding gate hands free."
Ryanair insists it does not expect to make more money from the new rules, as it will lose revenue from passengers 
with checked bags switching from the GBP25 fee to the GBP8 option.

Dublin/BERLIN (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC rejected on Thursday claims that it 
illegally employs hundreds of contract workers in Germany.
Some 700 of Ryanair's 1000 flight attendants in Germany signed their employment contracts with two companies 
based in Ireland, in contradiction with German law, German parliamentarian Pascal Meiser said on Wednesday.
The accusations are not true, Ryanair communications director Robin Kiely said, adding that the company and its 
service providers comply fully with EU law.
The two companies in question, Crewlink Ireland and Workforce International Contractors, are based in Dublin.
Meiser, who belongs to the hard-left Die Linke party, says the companies lack the necessary authorization for 
contract labour.
Ryanair has in recent times confronted labour law issues in a number of European countries. Trade unions are 
calling for the application of national labour law, rather than just Irish employment rules.
On Thursday, Ryanair said it has signed collective labour agreements with two Belgian trade unions.
The deals are with CNE-CSC and LBC-NVK, covering all of its directly-employed pilots and cabin crew in Belgium.
This follows, Ryanair said, similar deals in Spain, Portugal, and the UK.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - The European Commission said it has opened an in-depth investigation to assess 
whether measures in favour of Ryanair at the German airport of Frankfurt-Hahn are in line with State aid rules. The 
Commission will also investigate certain measures in favour of the airport operator FFHG.
Frankfurt-Hahn airport is a regional airport located in the German State of Rhineland-Palatinate, approximately 120 
kilometres west of Frankfurt am Main. It handles around 2.5 million passengers per year, as well as significant 
freight traffic.
 The airport is operated by the company Flughafengesellschaft Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH, which between 2009 and 
2017 was controlled by the State of Rhineland-Palatinate. On March 1 2017, the HNA Group purchased 82.5% of 
FFHG.
The Commission said it received a complaint concerning certain measures in favour of Ryanair with respect to its 
operations at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, as well as other measures in favour of airport operator FFHG. The 
complainant alleged that these measures amounted to illegal State aid in favour of Ryanair and FFHG respectively.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it has signed collective labour 
agreements with two Belgian trade unions.
The deals are with CNE-CSC and LBC-NVK, covering all of its directly-employed pilots and cabin crew in Belgium. 
This follows, Ryanair said, similar deals in Spain, Portugal, and the UK.
Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said: "We are pleased to have signed this latest CLA covering all of our directly 
employed pilots and cabin crew in Belgium. 
"These signed union agreements in Belgium, Spain, Portugal and the UK again demonstrate the considerable 
progress we're making in concluding union agreements with our people in our major EU markets."
Wilson continued: "We expect these new agreements will encourage the cabin crew unions in both Spain and 
Portugal to remove competitor airline employees (who have been blocking progress) and to quickly conclude cabin 
crew agreements in those two countries, as that's what our Portuguese and Spanish cabin crew are now 
demanding."
Shares closed 0.8% lower on Thursday at EUR12.205.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stobart Group Ltd on Wednesday said it swung to a loss in the first half of its financial 
year, despite a 21% increase in revenue. 
Stobart shares were trading down 6.8% at 200.41 pence each, the worst performer on the FTSE 250 index. 
For the six months to August 31, the infrastructure & support services company, which owns London Southend 
airport, posted a pretax loss of GBP18.8 million compared with a GBP111.6 million profit in the same period a year 
ago. 
The company's profit was hurt by the lack of income generated by the sale of its 49% interest in the parent of Eddie 
Stobart, Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Ltd, which resulted in a GBP123.8 million profit figuring in its interim 
balance sheet a year ago. 
The company's interim revenue increased to GBP151.3 million from GBP124.6 million a year ago. 
The company's Aviation business reported a earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation loss of 
GBP2.7 million, due to a GBP18.0 million investment in London Southend Airport route development and 
marketing.
The airport saw passengers up 37% to 838,742 from 610,492 in the half, with agreements reached with easyJet 
PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC. 
Meanwhile, the company's Energy division Ebitda increased to GBP6.5 million from GBP2.5 million a year prior, 
driven by customer mix, benefits of increased volume and tight cost control. 
Chief Executive Officer Warwick Brady said: "We have remained focused on operational progress in our Aviation 
and Energy divisions, which have both performed well in the period.
TOP NEWS: Stobart Swings To Interim Loss Despite Revenue Increase
"Having invested in the infrastructure for these divisions, we are now well placed to accelerate our commercial 
growth plans and demonstrate the value of the group's excellent operating businesses."
Currently, Stobart is engaged in a courtroom battle against former chief executive Andrew Tinkler who had its 
employment with the group terminated in June for "breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty" after Stobart 
accused him to have "jeopardised" the future success of the group.
Tinkler also tried to oust Chairman Ian Ferguson, a move that "totally" countered the company's interests and 
threatened to destabilise it, Stobart said. 
Tinkler denies wrongdoing saying he was removed for no good reason.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has signed a recognition agreement with a 
Spanish pilot union SEPLA, covering all of its directly employed pilots in Spain.
The budget airline said negotiations on a full collective labour agreement will begin in early November and will apply 
to all Ryanair's pilots in Spain by the end of January.
The move aligns with Ryanair's agreements with the SPAC union in Portugal and the BALPA union in the UK, as 
well as ANPAC in Italy.
Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said the move demonstrates the airline's progress toward concluding 
union agreements in its major EU markets.
"We expect that these agreements will encourage the cabin crew unions in both Spain and Portugal in particular to 
remove competitor airline employees (who have been blocking progress) and to quickly conclude cabin crew 
agreements in those countries, as that's what our Portuguese and Spanish cabin crew are now demanding," said 
Wilson.
Shares in Ryanair were up 2.4% at EUR12.62 on Wednesday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said profit decreased in the first half of its current 
financial year due to the higher fuel costs and compensation of passengers affected by flight delays and 
cancellations. 
The Irish budget airline said pretax profit for the six months ended September 30 declined 13% to EUR1.26 billion 
from EUR1.45 billion reported for the same period a year earlier, despite revenue improving by 8.1% to EUR4.79 
billion from EUR4.43 billion.
Ryanair said higher fuel, staff and compensation costs offset the strong revenue growth. In  addition, average fares 
declined 3% to EUR46 due to excess capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in the first quarter, and repeated air 
traffic controllers' strikes. 
Meanwhile, traffic improved by 6% on year during the period to 76.6 million, while load factor remained flat at 96%. 
The budge carrier also noted it returned EUR540 million in the first half to shareholders through a share buybacks.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it now expects annual traffic growth of 6% to 138 million passengers - slightly down on 
previous guidance of 139 million - following a 1% reduction in winter capacity. The airline's fuel bill is expected to 
come in about EUR460 million higher year-on-year, while other costs will grew on passenger compensations.
It guided after tax profit for all of financial 2019 to the end of March to be between EUR1.10 billion and EUR1.20 
billion, excluding recent acquisition Laudamotion.
However, Ryanair noted that this guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further, and the the 
absence of unforeseen strikes and negative Brexit developments.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Analysts were positive on "long-term winner" Ryanair's interim results, with a lower 
profit broadly in line with consensus and coming exactly three weeks after a profit warning.
Ryanair shares were up 4.8% at EUR12.00 on Monday, though they remain 21% lower in the year to date. Fellow 
London-listed airlines easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines were up 3.1% and 1.8% respectively in a 
read-across from Ryanair's results.
The Irish budget airline on Monday said pretax profit for the six months ended September 30 declined 13% to 
EUR1.26 billion from EUR1.45 billion reported for the same period a year earlier, despite revenue improving by 
8.1% to EUR4.79 billion from EUR4.43 billion.
Ryanair said higher fuel, staff and compensation costs offset the strong revenue growth. In addition, average fares 
declined 3% to EUR46 due to excess capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in the first quarter, and repeated air 
traffic controllers' strikes. 
The company's net margin for the period was 25%, down 4 percentage points from the 29% achieved a year ago.
"The recent profit warning meant there were no surprises in these results," said Liberum.
Ryanair at the start of October lowered its profit guidance for its current financial year due to strikes, reduced traffic 
and higher oil prices.
Profit guidance for the year to the end of March 31, 2019, was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to EUR1.20 
billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion. This guidance was maintained on Monday.
Liberum continued: "Margins continue to be squeezed by falling average fares on the one side and higher fuel and 
staff costs on the other, despite strong growth in ancillary revenues. However, margins remain at industry-leading 
levels, and we do not see these being fundamentally undermined by the move to recognise unions."
IN THE KNOW: Analysts Positive On "Winner" Ryanair Despite Profit Slip
While there may be short-term downside ahead through the seasonally weaker winter period, Liberum said it sees a 
softer share price as an opportunity to invest in the industry's "long-term winner".
Davy was similarly positive on the airline, with Ryanair expected to be an "undoubted beneficiary" of industry 
troubles, such as oil prices and excess capacity.
The Irish broker added that Ryanair's second quarter net profit of EUR877.1 million was modestly ahead of 
consensus of EUR856.5 million, though undershooting Davy's forecast of EUR913.6 million.
For the second quarter, revenue before exceptional items came in at EUR2.71 billion, in line with consensus at 
EUR2.70 billion.
Davy said that Ryanair's capital expenditure is likely to peak in 2020 at around EUR1.9 billion, as investments and 
aircraft come through.
Davy said it is likely to keep its forecasts for the current financial year and the one ahead - seeing revenue of 
EUR7.7 billion and EUR8.7 billion respectively for the years ending in March 2019 and 2020 - as Ryanair readies 
for summer next year.
Davy kept its Outperform rating on the stock, while Liberum kept its Buy rating with a EUR14.50 price target.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May will insist the Brexit deal is 95% complete as she faces MPs after a weekend of 
vicious attacks from within her own ranks. In a Commons statement after talks with EU leaders in Brussels, the 
prime minister will say the "shape of the deal across the vast majority" of the withdrawal agreement is now clear. 
She will tell MPs that since last month's fractious summit in Salzburg, "important progress" has been made on 
issues like security, transport and services. Protocols have been developed on how Brexit will impact Gibraltar and 
the UK's military base in Cyprus. May will tell the Commons that "taking all of this together, 95% of the withdrawal 
agreement and its protocols are now settled".

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to provide a full account of the killing of journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi, as Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince reportedly called his family to offer their condolences. King 
Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and effective ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz telephoned 
the dissident's son, Salah Khashoggi, who "expressed his sincere thanks" to the royals, the Saudi Press Agency 
LONDON BRIEFING: Compensation And Fuel Costs Sap Ryanair Profit
said. Many observers have expressed the belief that Khashoggi's killing, which was described for the first time as 
"murder" by a Saudi official on Sunday, could not have been carried out without the crown prince's approval. The 
report of their phone call came shortly after Erdogan pledged that he would go into the case "in detail" during a 
speech before members of his Justice & Development Party planned for Tuesday.

Italy's populist government was due Monday to reply to a letter from the European Commission, after it warned the 
country against an "unprecedented" deviation from eurozone budget rules. Rome's ruling populist parties are 
planning to raise next year's deficit to 2.4% of gross domestic product, from the 0.8% set by a previous government. 
On Sunday, Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio, leader of the ruling Five Star Movement, said Italy would respond to 
Brussels by standing up for its decisions. "We believe in the 2.4 [percent deficit target], we believe in the budget 
that we have drafted," Di Maio said in an interview with RAI state television.

President Donald Trump said he will pull the US from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty because 
Russia has violated the agreement. The 1987 pact, which helps protect the security of the US and its allies in 
Europe and the Far East, prohibits the US and Russia from possessing, producing or test-flying a ground-launched 
cruise missile with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. "Russia has violated the agreement. They have been violating it 
for many years," President Trump said after a rally in Elko, Nevada.

amortisation guidance to USD480 million from USD465 million. "2019 guidance will also point towards continuation 
of strong organic growth on the back of sustained ramp-up at key facilities, integration and expansion of acquired 
entities as well as strong operational performance," said NMC. Revenue in 2019 is forecast to increase by 22% to

development and chief medical officer, said: "The remarkable results of the SOLO-1 trial, which showed that 60% of

Miner Lonmin said it has secured a new financing facility, while annual production was also "pleasing". The new 
USD200 million metal purchase agreement is with Pangaea Investments Management , an associate of Jiangxi

financing deal. Lonmin is to settle its pre-existing term loan of USD150 million, and also cancel all undrawn debt. 
The firm said the deal will improve short-term liquidity, but will not address "fundamental business challenges". In 
December, Sibanye Gold offered to acquire Lonmin in an all-share deal in which Lonmin investors will receive 0.967 
of a Sibanye share for each Lonmin share held. Following completion, Sibanye shareholders will hold an 89% stake 
in the enlarged firm with the remainder held by Lonmin shareholders. Lonmin's platinum sales were above guidance 
at 681,500 ounces for the 12 months to September 30, though they did fall 3.5% year-on-year. Lonmin's total

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are set to open higher on Monday, despite growing global political 
tensions.
In early company news, budget airline Ryanair saw interim profit fall as average fares slid due to "excess capacity" 
in Europe and strikes.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 6.9 points higher at 7,056.70 on Monday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed closed up 0.3%, or 22.81 points at 7,049.80 on Tuesday.
"Asian shares bounced higher on Monday, as Chinese stocks extended their rebound for a second straight session, 
pulling European futures higher in the process. Beijing's pledge of support for the economy is overshadowing 
geopolitical concerns over Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit," said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital 
Group.
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index is up 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is climbing a 
sharp 4.6%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 2.5%.
Lawler continued: "Saudi Arabia will remain in focus on Monday as relations with foreign governments continue to 
deteriorate. Riyadh's hands are looking increasingly dirty following the disappearance of journalist Jamal 
Kasshoggi. This has encouraged investors to price in a changing relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia."
Over the weekend, a ruling party spokesman said Turkey is committed to uncovering all details on dissident 
journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, hours after the Saudi leadership confirmed 
the death.
"Turkey will reveal whatever happened. No one should have a doubt about it," said Omer Celik, from President 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice & Development Party, according to state news agency Anadolu.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Higher Call; Ryanair Hit By Decline In Fares
Early Saturday, Riyadh claimed that Khashoggi died at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul following a "fist fight," 
according to the state-run news agency SPA.
In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May will insist the Brexit deal is 95% complete as she faces MPs after a 
weekend of vicious attacks from within her own ranks.
In a Commons statement after talks with EU leaders in Brussels, the prime minister will say the "shape of the deal 
across the vast majority" of the withdrawal agreement is now clear.
She will tell MPs that since last month's fractious summit in Salzburg, "important progress" has been made on 
issues like security, transport and services.
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3% but the 
S&P 500 slightly lower and Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.5%.
In the economic calendar on Monday is Ireland wholesale price index at 1100 BST and the Chicago Fed National 
Activity index at 1330 BST.
In a thin corporate calendar scheduled for Monday, budget airline Ryanair reported a fall in first half profit as 
average fares slid due to "excess capacity" in Europe.
Total operating revenue - including Laudamotion - rose to EUR4.84 billion in the six months to September 30 from 
EUR4.43 billion a year ago. However, the airline's pretax profit slipped to EUR1.26 billion from EUR1.45 billion. 
Excluding Lauda - the former Air Berlin subsidiary in which Ryanair secured approval from the EU in July to 
increase its stake to 75% from 24.9% - revenue came in at EUR4.79 billion and profit at EUR1.32 billion.
While traffic grew 6% in the period to 76.6 million customers, average fares fell 3% to below EUR46.00.
"While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27%, these were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs. Our 
traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC disruptions on record, grew 6% at an 
unchanged 96% load factor," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
The company said its annual guidance is "heavily dependent" on air fares not declining further, while Ryanair also

GSK165 proving effective throughout the every-other-week phase, proving statistically significant at week 24. GSK 
said that the improvement in patient-based measures such as joint pain and swelling were "particularly marked".
QinetiQ said it has agreed to take a majority stake in a military operational training provider, with an option to 
acquire the remainder of the firm after two years, for GBP23.5 million.
QinetiQ will buy a 85% stake in Inzpire Group, which is expected to expand the FTSE 250-listed defence firm's 
operational training offering and should create a "leading position" in mission data and advice for the F35 and 
Typhoon aircraft.
Elsewhere on the London Main Market, Lonmin said platinum sales for its recently-ended financial year exceeded 
guidance despite "tough market conditions".
The miner sold 681,580 ounces of platinum during the year to September 30, ahead of guidance of 650,000 to 
680,000. The average rand full basket price for the fourth quarter was up 26% on a year ago.
Tonnes mined by its Generation 2 shafts for the year increased 1.6% to 7.6 million tonnes, reflecting a "consistent 
performance" at core shafts.
"Despite tough market conditions, except the favourable rand, we have delivered more than we promised in all 
areas of our business. These pleasing results demonstrate once again that despite these uncertain times, we can 
dig deep and use all levers within our control to maintain our net cash position," said Chief Executive Ben Magara.
Budget airline Ryanair reported a fall in first half profit as average fares slid due to "excess capacity" in Europe.
Total operating revenue - including Laudamotion - rose to EUR4.84 billion in the six months to September 30 from 
EUR4.43 billion a year ago. However, the airline's pretax profit slipped to EUR1.26 billion from EUR1.45 billion. 
Excluding Lauda - the former Air Berlin subsidiary in which Ryanair secured approval from the EU in July to 
increase its stake to 75% from 24.9% - revenue came in at EUR4.79 billion and profit at EUR1.32 billion.
While traffic grew 6% in the period to 76.6 million customers, average fares fell 3% to below EUR46.00.
"While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27%, these were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs. Our 
traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC disruptions on record, grew 6% at an 
unchanged 96% load factor," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
The company said its annual guidance is "heavily dependent" on air fares not declining further, while Ryanair also 
continues to monitor "significantly higher" oil prices on its unhedged exposures.
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3% but the S&P 
500 slightly lower and Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.5%.
In the economic calendar on Monday is Ireland wholesale price index at 1100 BST and the Chicago Fed National 
Activity index at 1330 BST.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings said profit fell in the first half of its current financial year due to the higher fuel costs and 
compensation of passengers affected by flight delays and cancellations. The Irish budget airline said pretax profit 
for the six months ended September 30 declined 13% to EUR1.26 billion from EUR1.45 billion reported for the 
same period a year earlier, despite revenue improving by 8.1% to EUR4.79 billion from EUR4.43 billion. Ryanair 
said higher fuel, staff and compensation costs offset the strong revenue growth. In addition, average fares declined 
3% to EUR46 due to excess capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in the first quarter, and repeated air traffic 
controllers' strikes. Meanwhile, traffic improved by 6% on year during the period to 76.6 million, while load factor 
remained flat at 96%.
----------
NMC Health lifted its annual guidance due to "positive developments" in the second half of 2018. The UAE-based 
private healthcare company has raised its 2018 revenue growth expectations to 24% from 22%. Earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation guidance was lifted to USD480 million from USD465 million. In 
calendar 2017, the FTSE 100 listed company recorded revenue of USD1.60 billion and Ebitda of USD353.4 million. 
The revenue growth guidance suggests 2018 revenue of GBP1.98 billion. NMC Health also predicts continuation of 
strong organic growth in 2019 on the back of the ramp-up of key facilities, integration and expansion of acquired 
entities, and a strong operational performance. For 2019, revenue is forecast to increase by between 22% and 24% 
and Ebitda by 18% to 20%. 
---------- 
BP said it has received UK regulatory approval to develop a new offshore oil and gas development near the 
Shetland Islands. The FTSE 100-listed oil major explained the UK Oil & Gas Authority had approved its request to 
develop the 20 million barrels of oil equivalent Alligin project in the North Sea. Alligin - operated by BP, which owns 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair Profit Slides On Strikes And Fuel Costs
half of the project with peer Royal Dutch Shell holding the remainder - is 140 kilometres off the coast of the 
Shetland Islands and its expected to produce 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at its peak. It is expected to 
come on-stream in 2020 after an expected GBP230 million in investment spend.
---------- 
GlaxoSmithKline said a phase two study of its rheumatoid arthritis drug showed promising results. The drug, 
GSK3196165, is also known as GSK165 and was studied in a randomised controlled trial of 222 patients with 
moderate to severe forms of arthritis. Results showed that the drug was effective as early as week 1 for all doses 
above 22.5 milligrams, continuing throughout the weekly dosing and statistically significant at week 12. Patients 
were given five weekly injections with the drug, followed injections every other week until week 50, with GSK165 
proving effective throughout the every other week phase, proving statistically significant at week 24. GSK said that 
the improvement in patient-based measures such as joint pain and swelling were "particularly marked".
---------- 
AstraZeneca said its Lynparza drug substantially reduced the risk of disease progression or death in patients with 
ovarian cancer. The drug, Lynparza, inhibits a type of protein that helps repair damaged cells called PARP or poly-
ADP ribose polymerase. The goal of this type of inhibitor is to stop PARP from repairing cancer cells. Lynparza is 
the only PARP inhibitor to have improved progression-free survival as a maintenance treatment in advanced 
ovarian cancer. The results emerged from Astra's SOLO-1 phase three randomised placebo-controlled trial of 391 
advanced ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, who were newly diagnosed and had already been given 
chemotherapy.
----------
Lloyds Banking Group is planning to buy back almost GBP2 billion in shares in 2019, the Financial Times reported. 
The FT reported the plans were at an "early stage" and would not be finalised until a board meeting in February. 
The plan would need to be approved by a regulator and could be derailed by a hard Brexit. Lloyds also could 
decide to keep the capital and use it for acquisitions, the newspaper noted. According to the FT, Lloyds hopes to be 
able to return about GBP4.5 billion in 2019 via a higher dividend and the share buyback. If it goes ahead as 
planned, the GBP2 billion buyback in 2019 will be double the GBP1 billion conducted in the current year.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were higher amid strong gains in Asia with NMC Health the best blue chip performer, up 9.1%. Wall 
Street was pointed to a higher open with oilfield services firm Halliburton, personal care company Kimberly-Clark 
and toy maker Hasbro reporting earnings before the market open in New York.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will insist the Brexit deal is 95% complete as she faces MPs after a weekend of 
vicious attacks from within her own ranks. In a Commons statement after talks with EU leaders in Brussels, the 
prime minister will say the "shape of the deal across the vast majority" of the withdrawal agreement is now clear. 
She will tell MPs that since last month's fractious summit in Salzburg, "important progress" has been made on 
issues like security, transport and services. Protocols have been developed on how Brexit will impact Gibraltar and 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair Profit Slides On Strikes And Fuel Costs
the UK's military base in Cyprus. May will tell the Commons that "taking all of this together, 95% of the withdrawal 
agreement and its protocols are now settled".
----------
A majority of British firms said Brexit had a negative effect on investment decisions, according to a new research on 
business preparations by the Confederation of British Industry. Eight out of ten firms said Brexit hit investment as 
the speed of talks was outpaced by the reality firms face on ground. The majority of firms said they will implement 
damaging contingency plans in the absence of greater certainty on Brexit by December. "The situation is now 
urgent," Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said. "Unless a withdrawal agreement is locked down by 
December, firms will press the button on their contingency plans. Jobs will be lost and supply chains moved."
----------
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to provide a full account of the killing of journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi, as Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince reportedly called his family to offer their condolences. King 
Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and effective ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz telephoned 
the dissident's son, Salah Khashoggi, who "expressed his sincere thanks" to the royals, the Saudi Press Agency 
said. Many observers have expressed the belief that Khashoggi's killing, which was described for the first time as 
"murder" by a Saudi official on Sunday, could not have been carried out without the crown prince's approval. The 
report of their phone call came shortly after Erdogan pledged that he would go into the case "in detail" during a 
speech before members of his Justice & Development Party planned for Tuesday.
----------
Italy's populist government was due Monday to reply to a letter from the European Commission, after it warned the 
country against an "unprecedented" deviation from eurozone budget rules. Rome's ruling populist parties are 
planning to raise next year's deficit to 2.4% of gross domestic product, from the 0.8% set by a previous government. 
On Sunday, Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio, leader of the ruling Five Star Movement, said Italy would respond to 
Brussels by standing up for its decisions. "We believe in the 2.4 [percent deficit target], we believe in the budget 
that we have drafted," Di Maio said in an interview with RAI state television.
----------
China has criticized US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from a nuclear arms treaty with Russia and 
to point at China as a reason for doing it. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed in 1987 by Ronald 
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, is still "greatly significant," a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on 
Monday. "This treaty has played an important role in easing international relations, advancing the process of 
nuclear disarmament, and even maintaining a global strategic balance and stability," said spokeswoman Hua 
Chunying. "What needs to be emphasized is that it is completely wrong to involve the Chinese side into the 
withdrawal from the treaty," she said. US officials have said the treaty limits what the US can do in response to 
Chinese medium-range missiles.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Friday it signed an agreement with the Portuguese pilot 
union SPAC, to cover all the airline's employed pilots in Portugal.
Under the deal, the union will provide for seniority and base transfer agreements. 
The Irish-based budget airline said it signed similar agreements with BALPA in the UK and ANPAC in Italy, earlier 
this week.
Furthermore, following negotiations in Madrid, Ryanair expects to ink similar deals with the Spanish pilot union, 
SEPLA, "shortly". 
Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said: "These signed agreements with our pilot unions in Portugal, the UK, Italy 
and shortly in Spain, demonstrate the considerable progress we're making in concluding union agreements with our 
people in our major EU markets." 
"Ryanair's pilots and cabin crew recognise that they enjoy better pay, better rosters, and significantly better job 
security than their counterparts at many other EU airlines, and we for our part, are recognising and working with 
unions to conclude agreements which address the major issues of concern to our pilots and cabin crew in all our 
major EU markets."
Ryanair shares were trading 0.7% higher at EUR11.72 each.

Budget Carrier Ryanair To Create Base At Berlin's Tegel Airport
Budget Carrier Ryanair To Create Base At Berlin's Tegel Airport

BERLIN (Alliance News) - Dublin-based Ryanair is to make Berlin's Tegel airport its 10th base in Germany from 
April next year, taking over four planes already stationed there by its partner airline Laudamotion, the budget carrier 
announced on Wednesday.
Making the announcement in Berlin, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sketched out plans to expand the 
airline's routes, but said he expected no growth in Germany, partly because of continuing conflict with German 
unions over pay and conditions.
For as long as there was no clarity with the unions, there would be no further investment in additional planes, he 
said.
Ryanair owns three quarters of Laudamotion, which has taken over take-off and landing slots at Tegel from the 
bankrupt Air Berlin subsidiary Niki.
Ryanair recently announced the closure of its base in Bremen in north-western Germany, where two planes are 
based. It also said it would withdraw two of the five planes it has at Weeze on the Dutch border, in what German 
trade union officials saw as a "declaration of war."
O'Leary denied this, insisting that fuel prices were to blame. "Oil is at 85 dollars, you idiots," said the chief 
executive, who has a reputation for combative language. Further rises in the price could lead to further closures, he 
added.
Nevertheless, O'Leary said talks with the Verdi trade union and the pilot's Cockpit association were going well, with 
meetings set for this week and next and agreement possible by Christmas.
In charge at Ryanair since 1993, O'Leary has expanded the former loss-maker to being Europe's largest budget 
airline. He indicated his intention to step down within three years.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Anglo-Spanish airline International Consolidated Airlines Group SA could lose its EU 
operating licence in a no-deal Brexit scenario, according to the Financial Times.
Under EU law, IAG, which owns both British Airways and Spain's Iberia, must be more than 50% EU-owned in 
order to maintain its operating licence within the bloc. In the event of a hard Brexit, IAG's UK nationals will stop 
counting toward this percentage. 
However, reducing its percentage of UK ownership could cause IAG to run afoul of US operating requirements on 
transatlantic routes.
Violeta Bulc, transport commissioner, was interviewed by the FT and told the newspaper than the airline has no 
reason to be caught out, as it has had ample warning.
"We've been asking everyone to take it seriously and to prepare for different scenarios," Bulc told the FT.
"If there is no deal [between the EU and UK], I don't need to point out which side the EU will be on," she added. "It's 
Spain that we will have in mind."
IAG also owns regional carrier Vueling in Spain and Aer Lingus in Ireland, which like Spain will remain part of the 
EU.
IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh has previously dismissed fears around post-Brexit ownership, according to the 
newspaper.
"We have every confidence that the US and UK will sign a deal that is in everyone's interests. All parties have a 
shared interest in ensuring that existing rights continue under new bilateral arrangements. This allows airlines on 
both sides of the Atlantic to operate existing services and seek to develop new ones," IAG told the FT.
PRESS: IAG Could Lose EU Operating Licence In Hard Brexit Event - FT
According to the Financial Times a majority of airlines, such as Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, have 
provisions enabling them to forcibly buy out non-EU investors to keep their licences.
However, the FT said that because IAG runs "the world's busiest long-haul route" with its flights from London to 
New York, any agreement between the US and UK would likely require the company to be majority-owned and 
controlled by UK parties.
https://www.ft.com/content/d7e6f5f2-cd3c-11e8-9fe5-24ad351828ab
Last Thursday, the UK Competition & Markets Authority announced that it will probe the transatlantic pact between 
IAG and American Airlines Group Inc in relation to this route.
Following an EU competition investigation in 2010, commitments were signed in relation to routes from London to 
New York, Chicago, Miami, Dallas, and Boston. These commitments are set to expire in 2020, making landing and 
take-off slots available to competitors.
The CMA said it had based its decision to review the deal on the fact that the European Commission may no longer 
be responsible for UK competition in 2020 once Brexit occurs.
Shares in IAG were up 0.8% at 587.40 pence on Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has launched 15 new routes despite the "worst-summer ever" 
and threats to air service in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Ryanair launched its Ireland Summer 2019 schedule in Dublin on Thursday with their chief marketing officer Kenny 
Jacobs warning that no agreement between the UK and EU about the UK's exit from the EU would make flights to 
the UK impossible.
Echoing Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary's statement last month, Jacobs said that the risk of a no-deal 
Brexit grounding flights across Europe is being "underestimated".
"Brexit we should all be worried about and talking about.
"There is no real progress until the transition agreement is signed and that gives us 20 more months of the status 
quo, but in the meantime there is a risk that in April next year it will not be possible to fly between the UK and 
Ireland," he said.
Ryanair have blamed "staff shortages and union disputes" for 2018's performance as the worst year on record for 
flight disruptions and cancellations.
Services in Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and Belgium were just some of the areas that saw strikes 
over the summer in a conflict between the airline's management and staff.
"It's not because the skies are too busy, it's because of a shortage of staff, particularly at the weekend," Jacobs 
said.
"Summer of 2019 could also be bad, so we will continue to make noise about this because we don't want mistakes 
to be repeated.
"We've made good progress on union agreements, and we're targeting to have more done by Christmas."
Ryanair Presses On With 15 New Routes Despite Brexit Worries
Jacobs also warned that weaker airlines are set to go bust, due to additional costs such as air fuel now at USD85 a 
barrel, a 50% increase in the price of aviation fuel since this time last year.
Jacobs said: "Oil makes up about half the cost base of any airline.
"Primerva, a Scandinavian airline have already gone bust. I think its probably fair to say, industrial relations at 
Ryanair was the news story, in the coming months it will be about fuel and consolidation and which airlines go bust.
"Airlines will go out of the market and capacity will be cut, which we're already seeing in the industry."
Despite the "turbulent" industry forecast, Ryanair were keen to stress they are confident in their new summer 
schedule and passenger growth.
15 new routes were launched, including connections to Gothenburg and Thessaloniki, which will deliver 16.4 million 
customers through Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Knock and Shannon airports, which will grow the company's Irish traffic by 
3%.
"This passenger growth, if you take that 16.4 million in Ryanair in Ireland alone, that would be the world's 23rd 
biggest airline, so if Ryanair Ireland was it's own separate airline, it would be bigger than Swiss, Thai, it's now the 
same size as Qantas," Jacobs added.
"This gives you an idea about the importance of Ireland and the size of Ryanair's Irish operation."
The group now offers 150 routes in total in Ireland, with over 1,000 weekly flights and 12,500 on-site jobs.

EasyJet Boss Predicts More Airline Failures After Primera Air Collapse
EasyJet Boss Predicts More Airline Failures After Primera Air Collapse

LONDON (Alliance News) - More airlines are likely to fail due to rising fuel costs, the boss of easyJet has warned.
Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said "weaker players" face increasing pressure amid the price of oil reaching 
around USD85 a barrel, compared with USD69 in April.
He made the comments just nine days after the collapse of Primera Air, which left thousands of passengers 
scrambling to find alternative flights home and customers with future bookings having to seek refunds from credit 
and debit card companies.
Lundgren expects more consolidation in the aviation industry, with successful airlines or airline groups taking over 
struggling carriers.
He told the annual convention of travel trade association Abta in Seville, Spain: "The fuel price being up there and 
perhaps continuing to increase will put some of those weaker players in a more difficult situation.
"I think there will be a consolidation from the fact that we're going to see more failures."
He went on: "If you are exposed to fuel in the way that you haven't hedged and you have a weakness in your model 
which means you don't have resilience … then you should be worried."
In April, British Airways owner IAG acquired a 5% stake in Norwegian with a view to starting takeover discussions.
Norwegian has struggled to contain costs amid its rapid expansion, and had around GBP2 billion of net debt at the 
end of last year.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary recently predicted it would "go bust this winter", but the Scandinavian carrier insisted 
his comment has "no root in reality".
EasyJet Boss Predicts More Airline Failures After Primera Air Collapse
Icelandic operator Wow – which operates low-cost flights to North America via its Reykjavik hub – told the Financial 
Times last month it is aiming to raise up to 300 million US dollars by selling "less than half" of the loss-making 
company through an initial public offering.
EasyJet bought Air Berlin's operations at the German capital's Tegel airport in December and is in discussions 
about taking over cash-strapped Italian airline Alitalia.
But Lundgren insisted easyJet has "plenty of room to grow organically" and will not rely on mergers and acquisitions 
to expand.
He noted that the Luton-based carrier is the second largest airline in Europe but "only has 10% market share".

IN THE KNOW: Liberum Cuts Ryanair Forecasts On Short Term Challenges
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Cuts Ryanair Forecasts On Short Term Challenges

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum on Friday cut its estimates and target price for Ryanair, despite growth 
passenger numbers in September.
The broker lowered its target price to EUR14.50 per share from EUR18.50, but retained Buy recommendation. 
Liberum believes that the best buying opportunities arise when market confidence in the company or the industry 
falters.
Ryanair shares were trading 0.6% higher on Friday at EUR11.79 each. The stock is down 29% over the last six 
months and down 24% in the year-to-date.
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo explained that Ryanair is facing short-term pressure from both industry-wide 
challenges and the fallout from its own industrial relations situation. 
"Weaker unit revenue trends are the main driver of the cuts to our current year forecasts," said Khoo.
"The continuing threat of industrial action in some of Ryanair's countries of operation is having an outsized impact 
on forward bookings," added Khoo.
In September pilot strikes caused almost 400 flights cancellations during, Ryanair reported on Tuesday.
Despite that, the Irish budged airline's September traffic was up 11% to 13.1 million, including recent acquisition of 
Lauda, which brought an extra 500,000 passengers. Load factor stood at 97%.
However, the analyst believes that potential passengers who want to avoid the uncertainty and risk of flight 
cancellation or disruption will avoid booking with Ryanair. 
Meanwhile, the company also said it now expects its fares to fall by 3% in the second quarter and by 2% in the 
second half of its financial year. Previously, Ryanair expected to deliver 1% growth in fares in the second quarter.
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Cuts Ryanair Forecasts On Short Term Challenges
Liberum also noted that fuel prices rose 43% in US dollar terms in the past year. The broker said that Ryanair would 
need a 12% average fare increase to offset in full the post-hedge price headwind next year, without load factor 
dilution. 
"Such a significant improvement in average fares is unlikely with Ryanair still guiding to a 10% capacity increase, 
albeit with some of this reflecting the recovery of capacity lost to strikes and operational disruption rather than 
outright growth," said Khoo.
As a result, Liberum cut its earnings per share estimates by 12% to 96 Euro cents in the year to the end of March 
2019. For financial 2020 and 2021, the broker lowered its forecasts by 22% to 90 cents and by 24% to 92 cents, 
respectively.
In profit after tax terms for 2019 financial year, Liberum moved to the bottom end of new EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 
billion guidance range, from the bottom end of old EUR1.26 billion to EUR1.31 billion range.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Barclays maintained its bullish stance on Ryanair, believing the airline remains a 
"structural winner" despite Monday's profit warning due to its cost and productivity advantages over rivals.
Shares in the budget airline were down 1.0% at EUR11.32 on Tuesday, having tumbled 13% on Monday. The stock 
is down 26% in the year-to-date.
Ryanair on Monday lowered its profit guidance for its current financial year due to strikes, lower traffic and higher oil 
prices.
Profit guidance for the current financial year - ending March 31, 2019 - was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to 
EUR1.20 billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion forecast previously.
For Ryanair's previous financial year, pretax profit came in at EUR1.61 billion.
"The earnings downgrade was widely anticipated, yet the share price reaction reminds us that we are in uncharted 
territory for the group," said Barclays.
The guidance downgrade comes amidst a flurry of strikes - Ryanair cancelling 400 flights in September alone due 
to worker action - as well as higher oil prices, with Brent oil currently trading around four-year highs, pushing the 
cost of fuel up. 
While the bank acknowledged there are still deals to be completed and the risk of more strikes lingers, Barclays 
kept its Overweight rating ahead of the "less disruptive" winter season. The bank did, however, lower its price target 
to EUR15.80 from EUR18.30.
Barclays highlighted that labour accounts for around 13% to 14% of Ryanair's cost base and with a "disciplined" 
focus on other expenses, the airline should be able to maintain its cost advantage against rivals. 
IN THE KNOW: Barclays Keeps The Faith In "Structural Winner" Ryanair
The same can be applied to productivity, said Barclays, which should remain "far superior" to peers in terms of both 
aircraft and labour utilisation.
Following the profit warning, the broker moved its estimates down to now see pretax profit for the current financial 
year at EUR1.26 billion, from EUR1.38 billion previously. 
For the year after, Barclays predicts profit will remain broadly flat, coming in at EUR1.27 billion compared to its 
forecast of EUR1.44 billion previously.
"We think the model has been softened not broken, and that the group's competitive advantages in its cost base 
and productivity will remain, leaving Ryanair as a structural winner," the broker said.

Wizz Air And Ryanair September Passengers Increase Despite Strikes
Wizz Air And Ryanair September Passengers Increase Despite Strikes

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline companies Wizz Air Holdings PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC said 
Tuesday that passenger numbers increased year-on-year in the month of September, despite continued cabin crew 
strikes resulting in cancelled flights.
Eastern-Europe focused carrier Wizz Air said the number of passengers carried in September increased 18% on 
the same period a year ago to 3.2 million from 2.7 million. On a rolling 12-month basis, Wizz Air saw passenger 
numbers up 22% to 32.8 million.
In August, Wizz Air added three new routes including flights to and from Poland and Norway which boosted the 
month's capacity numbers by 16% to 3.4 million. For the year-to-date, the airline's capacity grew 21% to 35.6 million 
seats.
Ryanair's September traffic was up 11% to 13.1 million, including recent acquisition Lauda, from 11.8  million in the 
same month a year prior.
The increase came despite staff shortages and pilot strikes causing almost 400 flights cancellations during the 
month.
Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said: "Regrettably, over 400 flights were cancelled in September because of 
two days of unnecessary pilot and cabin crew strikes in 5 countries, and repeated ATC staff shortages in the UK, 
Germany and France."
"During the entire month of September, while we cancelled just over 400 flights, we completed over 68,000 
scheduled flights with more than 80% of these flights arriving on time, as Ryanair continues to deliver the lowest 
fares, with the best punctuality of any major EU airline." 
Wizz Air's September load factor was up by 1.2 percentage point to 94.1% while Ryanair's was unchanged at 97%.
Wizz Air And Ryanair September Passengers Increase Despite Strikes
On Monday, Ryanair lowered its profit guidance for its current financial year due to strikes, lower traffic and higher 
oil prices.
Profit guidance for the year to the end of March was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to EUR1.20 billion, from 
EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion.
For 2018 financial year, pretax profit increased 10% year-on-year to EUR1.61 billion from EUR1.47 billion in 2017 
financial year.
The budget airline also attributed the cut in profit guidance to increased care and re-accommodation expenses as a 
result of strikes and fall in forward bookings.
Fuel costs also rose as oil prices increased to USD82 per barrel, affecting 10% of volumes and unit Laudamotion's 
fuel bill. Fuel costs for the second half of the year are expected to be EUR460 million higher than the year before.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.9% Tuesday morning at EUR11.32, while Wizz Air shares were trading down 0.5% 
at 2,635.87 pence each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are set to open lower on Tuesday amid political uncertainty in Europe 
and soft trading in Asia overnight.
In focus on Tuesday is the latest UK construction Purchasing Managers' Index reading for September, due at 0930 
BST, which is forecast to dip slightly from August.
In early company news, Ferguson reported a rise in annual revenue though profit dipped, while Royal Dutch Shell 
took a final investment decision on LNG Canada and airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air both saw passenger numbers 
grow in September.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 27.57 points lower at 7,468.10 on Tuesday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2%, or 14.53 points, at 7,495.67 on Monday.
"European markets underwent a mixed start to the week and Q3 yesterday with fairly decent gains for the German 
DAX, however the FTSEMib remained under pressure as political rhetoric out of Italy with respect to the recent 
budget pointed to the prospect of a showdown with the EU, as well as concerns about possible downgrades in the 
coming weeks," said CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
He added: "This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this morning with 
a lower open expected."
Attention in the UK will lie on the construction Purchasing Managers' Index reading for September, seen slipping to 
52.5 from 52.9 last month. The construction data comes following Monday's manufacturing beat, which showed the 
sector's pace of expansion unexpectedly accelerated in September.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Shell To Proceed With LNG Canada; UK PMI Due
However, Societe Generale sees the index falling further than this.
"We see downward pressures on all three components of the construction PMI; housing, commercial and civil 
engineering. We expect the overall construction PMI to fall from 52.9 to 52.1," said analysts at Societe Generale.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3007 early Tuesday ahead of the construction PMI, lower compared to USD1.3040 at 
the London equities close on Monday.
In company news, plumbing and heating products supplier Ferguson said revenue rose in its recently-ended 
financial year, though profit dipped, with its order book indicating growth in the coming months.
Revenue for the year to July 31 rose 7.6% to USD20.75 billion, though pretax profit fell to USD1.19 billion from 
USD1.42 billion. Before exceptional items, pretax profit grew to USD1.27 billion from USD1.21 billion. 
Ongoing trading profit rose 15% to USD1.51 billion.
The US business saw ongoing revenue increase of 9.9% on an organic basis, with acquisitions contributing a 
further 1.4%. In the UK, like-for-like revenue was up 0.7% though organic revenue was 5.3% lower due to the 
closure of branches and the exit of low margin wholesale business.
The company proposed a final dividend of 131.9 cents, up from 73.33 cents a year ago. This brings the total payout 
for the year to 189.3 cents, up 21% year-on-year.
"In the first eight weeks of our new financial year organic revenue growth has been broadly in line with the overall 
growth rate last year, though growth in September was slightly lower than August. The growth in our order books 
suggests continued growth in the months ahead," said Chief Executive John Martin. 
Shell Canada Energy, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell, on Tuesday said it has taken a final investment decision on 
LNG Canada.
LNG Canada is a major liquified natural gas project in Kitimat, in which Shell has a 40% working interest. With LNG 
Canada’s joint venture participants also having taken a final investment decision, construction is to start 
immediately, with first liquified natural gas expected "before the middle of the next decade".
Shell said its 40% share of the project's capital cost is within its capital investment guidance of USD25 billion to 
USD30 billion per year.
"LNG Canada is well positioned to help Shell meet the growing needs of customers at a time when we see an LNG 
supply shortage in our outlook. With significant integration advantages from the upstream through to trading, LNG 
Canada is expected to deliver Shell an integrated internal rate of return of some 13%, while the cash flow it 
generates is expected to be significant, long life and resilient," said Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden.
In other oil news on Tuesday, Brent oil hit its best level since late 2014 overnight of USD85.42 a barrel.
Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said a move in oil to USD100 per barrel could be on the 
cards.
"Concerns over tighter supply ahead of the Iran embargo are keeping the bulls firmly in control. Iran supplies almost 
3% of the world's daily oil consumption, so any sanctions on Iran will hit the supply side of the equation, and hard. 
Supply is looking fragile and when you then throw in Venezuela's declining output, the price looks well supported," 
said Lawler.

Back in company news, Ryanair and Wizz Air both reported a growth in passenger numbers for September.
Ryanair said total customers grew 11% in the month to 13.1 million, with load factor flat at 97%. This includes 
Lauda, which recorded 500,000 passengers in September. The month included two days of "unnecessary" strikes 
which resulted in over 400 flight cancellations, the budget airline highlighted.
Wizz Air meanwhile saw passengers grow 18% in September to 3.2 million, as load factor improved to 94.1% from 
92.9%.
Defence firm Meggitt said it has been awarded a five-year contract worth USD323 million with the US Defense 
Logistics Agency to supply wheels, brakes and related spare parts. The contract includes a further five-year option 
period and replaces a prior five year Indefinite Demand/Indefinite Quantity agreement, which expired on Sunday.
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended mostly in the green, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 
0.7%, the S&P 500 rising 0.4% but Nasdaq Composite closing 0.1% lower.
In Asia on Tuesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.1%. Markets in China are closed this week for the 
National Day Golden Week holiday, though the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong opened from Monday's holiday to 
trade 2.40% lower on Tuesday.
The economic events calendar on Tuesday has eurozone producer prices at 1000 BST.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ferguson said revenue was bolstered by strong trading in the US, however profit fell due to the impairment of an 
interest in an associate. For the year to the end of July, pretax profit fell to USD1.19 billion from USD1.42 billion the 
year before, due to a USD122 million impairment in its holding in Meier Tobler Group, which saw difficult trading 
conditions and has suspended dividends until 2020. Trading profit for the year rose by 15% to USD1.51 billion from 
USD1.31 billion, due to strong performances in the US and Canada & Central Europe regions, the former due to a 
strong residential, commercial and industrial market. Revenue was USD20.75 billion, up 7.6% from USD19.28 
billion the prior year. Although the US and Canada & Central Europe regions have performed well, UK trading profit 
continued to drop in a challenging market, Ferguson said, as a restructuring programme continues in that segment. 
----------
Royal Dutch Shell said its affiliate Shell Canada Energy has taken a final investment decision on LNG Canada, a 
liquefied natural gas project in Kitimat, Canada. Shell said its 40% share in the project's capital costs is within its 
current capital investment guidance, which stands in the range of USD25 billion and USD30 billion per year. The 
company said the other LNG Canada joint venture partners have also taken a final investment decision. 
Construction, therefore, will start immediately with first liquefied natural gas estimated "before the middle of the next 
decade". Shell said it expects to export 14 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per annum from two processing 
units of the project, with the potential to expand to four processing units in the future.
---------
Meggitt said it secured an indefinite demand/indefinite quantity deal with the US Defense Logistics Agency to 
supply wheels, brakes and related spare parts. The contract is worth USD323 million over the five-year period and 
covers the supply of depot-level spares for a number of defence platforms including F-16 Falcon, H-60 Blackhawk 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Construction Sector Growth Weakest In Six Months
and CH-47 Chinook. The contract also includes a further five year option period and replaces a prior five-year 
agreement which expired on Sunday.
----------
Ryanair said total customers grew 11% in September to 13.1 million, with load factor flat at 97%. This includes 
Lauda, which recorded 500,000 passengers in September. The month included two days of "unnecessary" strikes 
which resulted in over 400 flight cancellations, the budget airline highlighted.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were lower with Royal Mail the worst blue chip performer, down 9.5% following the postal operator's 
profit warning late Monday. The pound was down against the dollar after data showed UK construction industry 
slowed to its weakest output in six months in September. Wall Street was pointed to a lower open. 
----------
FTSE 100: down 0.6% at 7,447.64
FTSE 250: down 0.7% at 20,260.02
AIM ALL-SHARE: down 0.6% at 1,094.60
GBP: down at USD1.2959 (USD1.3040)
EUR: down at USD1.1517 (USD1.1566)
GOLD: up at USD1,192.57 per ounce (USD1,188.75)
OIL (Brent): down at USD84.44 a barrel (USD84.70)
(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK construction sector unexpectedly grew at the weakest pace in six months in September, as all three sub-sectors 
lost momentum, survey data from IHS Markit showed. The IHS Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers' 
index fell to 52.1 from 52.9 in August. In contrast, economists had expected the index to rise to 53.1. A PMI reading 
above 50 suggests growth in activity. Civil engineering was the worst performing sub-sector. Activity growth slowed 
in house building and commercial construction.
----------
UK house prices logged steady growth in September, data from Nationwide Building Society showed. House prices 
grew 2% year-on-year in September, the same rate as seen in August. Prices were expected to climb 1.9%. On a 
monthly basis, house prices gained 0.3%, in contrast to a 0.5% fall in August. This was slightly faster than the 
expected 0.2% rise. "Looking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, 
especially in the labor market, but also with respect to interest rates," Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief 
economist, said.
----------
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has issued a fresh warning to Theresa May that there must 
be agreement on the Irish border if she wants a Brexit deal. Despite the rejection of key elements of May's 
Chequers blueprint for Brexit at last month's informal summit in Salzburg, Juncker insisted the EU still wanted an 
agreement. However, addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg ahead of the next EU summit in Brussels 
later this month, he stressed the EU would not compromise on key principles. "We will have an interesting meeting 
as far as Brexit is concerned. We want to have a deal. Those who think a no-deal would be a better solution are not 
aware of the difficulties such a scenario would imply," he said.
----------
High-skilled workers will be given priority over those who head to the UK for low-paid jobs under new immigration 
rules after Brexit, May said. The prime minister confirmed that EU countries will be treated the same as those 
across the rest of the world when the new system is introduced after the Cabinet agreed the move last month. 
Tourists and visitors making short trips to the UK from low-risk countries would be dealt with swiftly through 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Construction Sector Growth Weakest In Six Months
electronic visa checks. May said the long-awaited Tory immigration plans would be fair for "ordinary working 
people".
----------
Chancellor Philip Hammond has predicted a "deal dividend" which could fund tax cuts and public service spending 
once a Brexit deal is reached. Hammond's forecast came as he called on Conservatives to stand "four-square" 
behind Theresa May as she enters the final weeks of negotiations ahead of a hoped-for deal in November. In a 
scathing attack on Boris Johnson, the Chancellor dismissed the former foreign secretary's Brexit proposals as 
"fantasy world" and said he does not believe he will ever be prime minister.
----------
President Donald Trump claimed Monday he wants the FBI to conduct a "very comprehensive" investigation of 
sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The remarks by Trump from the 
White House Rose Garden come amid reports the White House is limiting the scope of the investigation. "I want 
them to do a very comprehensive investigation," Trump said of the FBI. "Whatever that means, according to the 
senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority, I want them to do that." At the same time, Trump said 
he wants the investigation to "go quickly," calling the process "unfair" to Kavanaugh and his family. Trump agreed to 
allow the FBI to conduct a supplemental background investigation of Kavanaugh after undecided Senators 
indicated they would withhold their support for the Supreme Court nominee without a new probe.
----------
The Senate will vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the US Supreme Court this week, the body's top 
Republican, Mitch McConnell, said Monday. In a floor speech, McConnell, the majority leader, accused the 
Democrats of delaying Kavanaugh's confirmation as he announced the vote. "The time for endless delay and 
obstruction has come to a close," McConnell said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday lowered its profit guidance for its current financial 
year due to strikes, lower traffic and higher oil prices.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings opened down 9.4% at EUR11.88 on the profit outlook cut.
Profit guidance for the year to the end of March 31, 2019, was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to EUR1.20 
billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion, as a result of lower traffic and weaker fares in September, caused 
by two years of coordinated strikes across Europe.
For 2018 financial year, pretax profit increased 10% year-on-year to EUR1.61 billion from EUR1.47 billion in 2017 
financial year.
The budget airline also attributed the cut in profit guidance to increased care and re-acommodation expenses as a 
result of strikes and fall in forward bookings.
Fuel costs also rose as oil prices rose to USD82 per barrel, affecting 10% of volumes and unit Laudamotion's fuel 
bill. Fuel costs for the second half of the year are expected to be EUR460 million higher than the year before.
Fares for the second half of the year are guided to be down 2.0%, from its previous expectation of remaining flat 
from the year before, and slower traffic growth is expected to cut traffic for the full year to 138 million, from the 
previous guidance of 139 million.
In response to the lower fares, Ryanair will implement certain cuts to its winter capacity, with the closure of two 
bases in Germany, and a trimming of one bases from five aircraft to three.
Ryanair said it cannot rule out further disruptions in the third quarter ending December, which could see its profit 
guidance lowered even more.

"While we successfully managed 5 strikes by 25% of our Irish pilots this summer, 2 recent coordinated strikes by 
cabin crew and pilots across 5 EU countries has affected passenger numbers, close in bookings and yields, and 
forward air fares into Q3. While we regret these disruptions, we have on both strike days operated over 90% of our 
schedule. However, customer confidence, forward bookings and Q3 fares has been affected, most notably over the 
Oct school mid-terms and Christmas, in those 5 countries where unnecessary strikes have been repeated," said 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London stocks were mixed early Monday, with a profit warning from Ryanair leading to 
bumpy trade for FTSE 100-listed airline stocks easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines.
In focus in the UK on Monday is September's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which is expected to 
decline slightly from August.
The FTSE 100 was down 0.1%, or 8.30 points, at 7,501.90. The FTSE 250 was up 0.3%, or 51.86 points, at 
20,358.90 while the AIM All-Share was up 0.1% at 1,099.55.

Small Companies down 0.1% at 12,133.50.
Over in mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris and DAX 30 in Frankfurt were up 0.1% and 0.3% higher respectively. 
Sinking 7.7% in early trade was Ryanair after cutting its annual profit guidance by 12% due to higher oil prices and 
strikes.
Profit guidance for its current financial year ending March 31, 2019, was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to 
EUR1.20 billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion seen previously, as a result of lower traffic and weaker 
fares in September, caused by two years of coordinated strikes across Europe.
Fares for the second half of the year are guided to be down 2%, from its previous expectation of remaining flat from 
the year before, and slower traffic growth is expected to cut traffic for the full year to 138 million, from the previous 
guidance of 139 million.

The budget Irish airline added that it cannot rule out further disruptions in the third quarter ending December, which 
could see its profit guidance lowered even more.
The update from Ryanair hit easyJet in a negative read-across, down 4.5% and the FTSE 100's worst performer 
early Monday, while British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines was down 2.5%.
Towards the other end of the index, United Utilities gained 1.3% after Deutsche Bank raised the water firm to Buy 
from Hold.
RSA Insurance was also benefiting from a broker rating upgrade, 1.3% higher after Berenberg raised the stock to 
Buy from Hold.
Just Group was at the bottom of the mid-caps, down 7.6% after announcing its chief financial officer of 12 years will 
be stepping down. 
Simon Thomas is to step down as chief financial officer at the end of October. David Richardson, currently deputy 
chief executive officer and managing director of UK corporate business, be appointed interim CFO in addition to his 
current responsibilities. The search for a permanent replacement for Thomas is now underway, Just Group said.
The economic calendar on Monday has manufacturing PMIs from France, Germany, the eurozone and the UK at 
0850 BST, 0855 BST, 0900 BST and 0930 BST respectively. In the US, the Markit manufacturing PMI is at 1445 
BST while the ISM manufacturing PMI is at 1500 BST.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3039 early Monday ahead of the manufacturing data, soft compared to USD1.3048 at 
the London equities close on Friday.
The UK manufacturing reading is seen declining slightly to 52.5 in September from the 52.8 posted for last month.
Already released, manufacturing data from China overnight showed the country's manufacturing sector weakened 
in September amidst an ongoing trade war with the US.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers index stood at 50.8 in September, a drop from August's 51.3, 
according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, and below consensus of 51.2.
The independent Caixin manufacturing PMI fell from 50.6 in August to 50, the lowest level in more than one year. 
Any score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, while a reading below the mark indicates contraction.
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.5%. Markets in China are closed this week for the 
National Day holiday, though Hong Kong will re-open on Tuesday.
Back in the UK, the Conservative Party conference kicked off on Sunday amid intense debate over Prime Minister 
Theresa May's "Chequers" strategy.
The four-day event, taking place in Birmingham, comes with speculation that eurosceptics could challenge May's 
leadership in order to steer Britain towards a Canada-style free-trade deal after Brexit.
In an interview published in the Sunday Times just hours before the conference kicked off, former foreign secretary 
Boris Johnson described May's plan for leaving the EU as "deranged" and "preposterous."

Johnson will be speaking at a conference fringe event on Tuesday, while May delivers a closing speech on 
Wednesday. In the address, she is expected to urge the party to rally behind her Brexit deal as well as focusing on 
immigration.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair lowered its profit guidance for its current financial year due to air strikes, lower traffic and higher oil prices. 
Profit guidance for the year to the end of March 31, 2019, was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to EUR1.20 
billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion, as a result of lower traffic and weaker fares in September, caused 
by two years of coordinated strikes across Europe. For 2018 financial year, pretax profit increased 10% year-on-
year to EUR1.61 billion from EUR1.47 billion in 2017 financial year. The budget airline also attributed the cut in 
profit guidance to increased care and re-acommodation expenses as a result of strikes and fall in forward bookings. 
In addition, Ryanair said it could not rule out further disruptions in the third quarter ending December, which could 
see its profit guidance lowered even more.
----------
Rio Tinto said, along with joint venture partners Mitsui & Co and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp, it will invest 
USD1.55 billion to "sustain production capacity" at the Robe River project in western Australia. Rio Tinto will invest 
a total of USD820 million in the iron ore project in the Pilbara region of Australia. The investment forms part of Rio 
Tinto's existing replacement capital guidance of about USD2.7 billion for 2018 to 2020. The FTSE 100-listed mining 
giant, along with its two Japanese partners, will invest USD967 million to develop the Mesa B, C and H deposits at 
Robe Valley, of which USD513 million will be paid by Rio Tinto. 
----------
Tesco on Friday said its banking unit agreed to pay GBP16.4 million penalty to the Financial Conduct Authority 
related to a 2016 cyber attack. Back in November 2016, Tesco Bank was the victim of a criminal fraud attack, it 
said, which did not involve the theft or loss of any customers' data. However, the incident has led to 34 transactions 
where funds were debited from customers' accounts, and other customers having normal service disrupted. The 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair Warns On Profit Amid Air Strikes, Fuel Costs
news was first reported by Sky News on Tuesday last week, which said that Tesco Bank was contesting the scale 
of the proposed GBP30 million penalty and was in active negotiations with the watchdog about it. "We are very 
sorry for the impact that this fraud attack had on our customers," said Tesco Bank Chief Executive Gerry Mallon.
----------
Just Group said Chief Financial Officer Simon Thomas will step down from his role at the end of October. Thomas 
will be replaced by Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of UK Corporate Business David 
Richardson in an interim capacity. Richardson was previously chief financial officer of Partnership Assurance Group 
from 2013 to 2016. The FTSE 250-listed financial services company said the search for Thomas' successor is 
underway and an announcement will be made in due course.
----------
AstraZeneca said it agreed to sell commercial rights for Atacand and Atacand Plus in Europe to Cheplapharm 
Arzneimittel. Atacand is a receptor antagonist blocker for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Under the 
terms of the agreement, the FTSE 100-listed pharmaceutical company said it has received a payment of USD200 
million from Cheplapharm. In addition to that, AstraZeneca said it will secure a time-bound payment of USD10 
million as well as sales-contingent milestones. AstraZeneca said it will continue to manufacture and supply Atacand 
and Atacand Plus under the agreement and will continue to commercialise the medicines in all markets where it still 
holds the rights.
----------
Aston Martin Lagonda cut the top end of its initial public offering price range, the Financial Times reported, 
potentially keeping the luxury carmaker out of the FTSE 100. The FT reported that Aston Martin has cut the top end 
of its IPO price range to GBP20 from GBP22.50 previously. The company has also increased the bottom end of its 
range to GBP18.50 from GBP17.50. The new range gives Aston Martin an expected valuation of GBP4.2 billion to 
GBP4.5 billion, down from its previously expected valuation of between GBP4.5 billion and GBP5.1 billion. If the 
values of the current FTSE 100 constituents remain broadly the same until the next reshuffle in December, the 
James Bond carmaker would miss out on a spot in the blue chip index.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were higher amid optimism after Canada and the US reached a trade agreement. The pound was 
flat against the dollar as data showed manufacturing sector activity in the UK saw an upturn in the month of 
September. Wall Street was pointed to a higher open. 
----------
FTSE 100: up 0.1% at 7,517.27
FTSE 250: up 0.8% at 20,472.73
AIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.1% at 1,100.05
GBP: flat at USD1.3050 (USD1.3048)
EUR: flat at USD1.1616 (USD1.1619)
GOLD: down at USD1,185.72 per ounce (USD1,192.70)
OIL (Brent): up at USD83.21 a barrel (USD82.85)
(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in September, survey data from IHS Markit and Chartered 
Institute of Procurement & Supply showed. The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.8 in 
September from 53.0 in August, which was revised up from 52.8. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the 
sector. "On the price front, both output charges and input costs rose at faster rates in September, which may exert 
further upward pressure on consumer prices in future," Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, said.
----------
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair Warns On Profit Amid Air Strikes, Fuel Costs
Unemployment in the eurozone dropped to 8.1% in August, the lowest rate since November 2008, according to 
figures released. Across the 19-country currency bloc, 13.2 million people were without a job in August, according 
to the data from the EU's statistics agency Eurostat. The figure represents a fall of 0.1 percentage point from July. 
Youth unemployment remained at 16.6% in August, plateauing after several months of decline.
----------
Optimism in the UK financial services sector ebbed away in the third quarter of 2018, amid worries about Brexit and 
headcount cuts within the banking sector, according to the latest survey by the Confederation of British Industry and 
accountancy firm PwC. The quarterly survey of 100 financial firms has declined in every quarter but one - the first 
quarter of 2017 - since the start of 2016. The decline in sentiment was particularly marked in banking and 
investment management, the CBI and PwC said. Across the entire sector net optimism registered negative 30% 
among respondents to the recent survey. Overall business volumes increased slightly in the three months to the 
end of September, with business volumes higher for UK insurers, stable for banks and lower for investment 
managers. In the coming quarter, overall business volumes are expected to be unchanged, with the survey 
managers said represented the weakest growth expectations since 2009.
----------
Philip Hammond has launched a scathing attack on Boris Johnson, saying he does not expect the former foreign 
secretary to become prime minister. After a day in which Theresa May and senior Tories lined up to heap criticism 
on her most high-profile critic, the Chancellor launched his own attack on his former Cabinet colleague. Asked by 
the Daily Mail whether Johnson could become prime minister, Hammond said "I don't expect it to happen" and 
suggested Johnson could not do "grown-up politics". He went on to attack the flamboyant Brexiteer for having "no 
grasp of detail" on complex subjects like Brexit, suggesting his greatest achievement to date had been introducing 
the "Boris Bike" cycle scheme while London mayor. The attack came at the end of the first day of the Conservative 
Party's annual conference in Birmingham in which its fault lines over Brexit, already exposed, started to crack open 
with just weeks to go to settle a withdrawal deal with Brussels.
----------
China's manufacturing sector weakened in September amidst an ongoing trade war with the US, according to two 
closely monitored government figures. The official manufacturing purchasing managers index stood at 50.8 in 
September, a slight drop from August, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The figure was 
slightly lower than the median estimate of 51.2, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The independent 
Caixin manufacturing PMI fell from 50.6 in August to 50, the lowest level in more than one year. The survey queried 
430 purchasing managers. A measurement of 50 marks the dividing line between expansion and contraction.
----------
After tough negotiations, the US and Canada have agreed on a new trade deal with Mexico that replaces the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) but remains a trilateral bloc. The agreement, announced late Sunday, was 
reached at the last minute - just before a deadline was set to arrive at midnight local time. The deal was hailed by 
Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Twitter as "a good day for Canada & our closest trading partners." The 
new trade agreement will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London ended mixed on Monday, as sharp falls from Royal Mail, airlines and 
housebuilders stocks saw the FTSE 100 slip below the 7,500 mark.
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2%, or 14.53 points at 7,495.67. The FTSE 250 ended up 0.5%, or 94.17 
points, at 20,401.21, and the AIM All-Share closed up 0.3%, or 3.11 points, at 1,101.61.
The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.3% at 12,727.98, the Cboe 250 closed up 0.4% at 18,514.60, and the Cboe Small 
Companies ended 0.1% lower at 12,135.16.
On the London Stock Exchange, Rentokil Initial ended up 3.6% as the pest control firm acquired outsourcer Mitie 
Group's pest control unit for GBP40 million in cash.
RSA Insurance closed up 2.8% after Berenberg raised the insurer to Buy from Hold, believing there was an "over-
reaction" to last week's weather-battered trading update.
Languishing at the other end of the large cap index, Royal Mail ended the the worst performer down 18% after the 
postal operator forecast lower full-year profit amid challenging conditions in the UK. 
Royal Mail revised its adjusted operating profit before transformation costs down to between GBP500 million and 
GBP550 million for its full financial year ending March. This compares to a GBP694 million adjusted operating profit 
the year before.
Royal Mail's UK productivity performance was "significantly below plan" at just 0.1% in the first half of its financial 
year with full year performance expected to be "significantly below target" at the upper end of the 2% to 3% range.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Royal Mail And Ryanair Profit Warnings Sink FTSE
As such, cost savings targets have subsequently been dropped to GBP100 million from GBP230 million with plans 
to implement "a range of short-term cost actions" being enacted.
"This is a cause for concern for many investors despite the fact that management have stated that the attractive 
dividend will be unaffected. We would hope that the parcels and GLS business can continue with their rapid growth. 
A stalling here, caused by perhaps industrial action or competitive pressures, will surely result in further troubles for 
the group," said Share Centre analyst Helal Miah.
Blue chip airlines were also reeling in the wake of a profit warning from Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings, which cut its 
forecast for full-year profit, citing rising oil prices and the impact of recent coordinated strikes across Europe.
Ryanair shares closed down 13% while peers easyJet and British Airways parent International Consolidated 
Airlines Group ended down 7.0% and 2.6% respectively. 
Ryanair's profit guidance for the year to the end of March 31, 2019, was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to 
EUR1.20 billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion. For 2018 financial year, pretax profit increased 10% year-
on-year to EUR1.61 billion from EUR1.47 billion in 2017 financial year. 
The Irish budget airline also attributed the cut in profit guidance to increased care and re-acommodation expenses 
as a result of strikes and fall in forward bookings. 
In addition, Ryanair said it could not rule out further disruptions in the third quarter ending December, which could 
see its profit guidance lowered even more.
In addition, housebuilders also ended among the worst blue chip performers after UK Prime Minister Theresa May 
over the weekend announced plans for a stamp duty surcharge of between 1% and 3% to be imposed on sales of 
property to foreign nationals who do not pay UK tax. 
Berkeley Group closed down 3.4%, Persimmon down 1.9%, Barratt Developments down 1.6%, Taylor Wimpey 
down 2.0%. 
The capital raised would go towards measures to tackle rough sleeping, and is designed to ease pressure on the 
housing market and make homes more affordable. 
Analysts at Shore Capital called the idea "ill-judged" and a move that plays on the idea that overseas house buyers 
leave the properties empty.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3040 at the London equities close, compared to USD1.3048 at the close on Friday, 
despite data showing that UK manufacturing sector activity saw an unexpected upturn in the month of September.
The UK manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in September, survey data from IHS Markit and Chartered 
Institute of Procurement & Supply showed. 
The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.8 in September from 53.0 in August, which was revised 
up from 52.8. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
"The reaction in the forex market has been very much mute as the bigger focus remains on the Brexit related 
issues. But the silver lining is that the manufacturing data is still above the critical level of 50 which shows 
expansion but the net lending numbers are dropping and this shows that credit conditions are not becoming better 
in the country," said ThinkMarkets analyst Naeem Aslam.

As the Conservative Party conference rolled on in Birmingham, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond 
used his keynote speech as a rallying cry to urge fellow party members to "stand together" as Prime Minister 
Theresa May seeks to secure a Brexit deal based on her Chequers plan.
The chancellor promised he would maintain "enough fiscal firepower" to support the economy in the case of a no-
deal Brexit.
Declaring that the Conservatives remained "the party of business", Hammond announced reforms of the 
apprenticeship levy to meet companies' concerns as well as a GBP125 million package to boost the number of well-
paid jobs across the UK.
Hammond could not resist making a few jibes at the Labour party's expense as he denounced the opposition as a 
"backward-looking party" which is "totally unfit to govern", he said.
The Runnymede and Weybridge MP won applause from activists as he declared: "Jeremy Corbyn boasts that 
Labour are a government-in-waiting. Well, I say let's keep him waiting, this year, next year and every year".
In Paris the CAC 40 ended up 0.2%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended up 0.8%. 
The euro stood at USD1.1566 at the European equities close, against USD1.1619 late Friday, despite the jobless 
rate in the eurozone falling to its lowest level in a decade. 
Unemployment in the eurozone dropped to 8.1% in August, the lowest rate since November 2008, according to 
data from the EU's statistics agency Eurostat.
Across the 19-country currency bloc, 13.2 million people were without a job in August, according to the figures from 
Eurostat. The figure represents a fall of 0.1 percentage point from July.
Stocks in New York were higher at the London equities close amid optimism over US and Canadian officials 
agreeing a trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement shortly before a midnight deadline.
The DJIA was up 1%, the S&P 500 index up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.5%.
The new trade deal, called the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will reportedly provide more market 
access to US dairy farmers and effectively cap Canadian automobile exports to the US.
In a joint statement US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia 
Freeland said the agreement will "strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new 
opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home".
US President Donald Trump, a harsh critic of NAFTA, praised the USMCA as a "historic transaction" in a post on 
Twitter on Monday.
The leaders of the US, Canada, and Mexico are expected to sign the new agreement before the end of November, 
although it will still need to be approved by Congress.

its highest level since November 2014. 
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Royal Mail And Ryanair Profit Warnings Sink FTSE
Investors widely expect the North Sea benchmark to hit USD100 per barrel for the first time since 2015's crash 
amid rising geopolitical risks, including looming US sanctions on Iran, which will come into effect on November 4.
The sanctions would squeeze Iranian crude exports, hitting the market despite other exporters increasing supply.
Oil prices also remain supported by supply disruptions in places such as Venezuela and the recent decision of the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to leave production steady.
Gold was quoted at USD1,188.75 an ounce at the London equities close against USD1,192.70 late Friday.

a stamp duty surcharge of between 1% and 3% to be imposed on sales of property to foreign nationals who do not 
pay UK tax. The money raised would go towards measures to tackle rough sleeping, and is designed to ease 
pressure on the housing market and make homes more affordable. Analysts at Shore Capital called the idea "ill-

OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
Ryanair, down 8.5%. The Irish airline lowered its profit guidance for its current financial year due to strikes, lower 
traffic and higher oil prices. Profit guidance for the year to the end of March 31, 2019, was lowered to a range of 
EUR1.10 billion to EUR1.20 billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion, as a result of lower traffic and weaker 
fares in September, caused by two years of coordinated strikes across Europe. For 2018 financial year, pretax profit 
increased 10% year-on-year to EUR1.61 billion from EUR1.47 billion in 2017 financial year. The company also 
attributed the cut in profit guidance to increased care and re-acommodation expenses as a result of strikes and fall 
in forward bookings. Shares in blue chip rivals easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines Group were down 
3.6% and 1.0% respectively, while midcap peer Wizz Air was down 3.6%. 
----------
Big Sofa Technologies, down 57% at 3.0p. The video analytics provider announced plans to raise GBP1.7 million 
through a subscription of 56.2 million shares at 3.0 pence per share. Novum Securities will unconditionally 
subscribe for 33.3 million shares, and will be appointed as a joint broker to the company. Ipsos has subscribed for 
11.4 million shares, which is conditional on the resolutions being approved at Big Sofa next general meeting on 
October 18. Proceeds will go towards funding the company's working capital requirements, in particular funding 
investment into research & developments, as well as expanding Big Sofa's sales and marketing activities, 
especially in the US. In addition, for the first half of 2018, Big Sofa reported a narrowed pretax loss of GBP1.8 
million from GBP2.2 million the year before, due to fall in administrative expenses to GBP2.2 million from GBP2.5 
million.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Striking staff have forced Ryanair Holdings PLC to cancel around 250 flights on Friday, 
potentially affecting tens of thousands of passengers across Europe.
A dispute over pay and conditions between the Irish budget airline and staff in six European countries will see them 
walk out for 24 hours.
Ryanair had cancelled 150 flights due to an "unnecessary" strike in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
Italy.
On Thursday the airline said pilots in Germany would also be going on strike, with up to 100 flights shelved as a 
result.
Ryanair Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew said the action was "deeply regrettable".
"It is deeply disappointing that some of our customers and our people in Germany tomorrow will have their flights 
disrupted by an unnecessary strike called at short notice," he said.
The strikes are the latest in a series of walkouts by staff at Europe's largest low-cost airline.
On September 12 dozens of flights were cancelled in Germany after pilots and flight attendants refused to work for 
24 hours.
In August several days of strikes involving staff in Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands saw 
hundreds of flights cancelled.
Earlier this month Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said strikes by pilots were necessary to keep air fares 
down.

He insisted industrial disputes with the airline's staff have caused "minimal disruption" as he pledged not to "roll 
over".

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC on Friday said it expects to deliver a strong performance in final quarter of 
2018 financial year and profit for the year will be the upper at end of the company's guidance, partly helped by one-
off events such as the bankruptcies of rivals Monarch and Air Berlin and the flight cancellations suffered by Ryanair 
Holdings PLC.
The British low-cost carrier added, however, that disruption across Europe continues to be an industry wide issue 
and is having an impact on revenue, cost and operational performance, with the main causes being European 
industrial action and air traffic restrictions.
easyJet expects headline pretax profit for the year to September-end to be between GBP570 million and GBP580 
million and revenue, including Berlin Tegel airport, to be around GBP5.89 billion.
easyJet bought some assets from insolvent German airline Air Berlin in December last year, and commenced flights 
from Tegel in January.
Passenger numbers for the financial year, excluding Tegel, are expected to increase by 5.4% to 84.6 million, driven 
by an expected increase in capacity of 4.2% to 90.3 million seats. The capacity was kept lower than originally 
planned due to the flight disruptions. Load factor for the full year is expected to increase by 1.0 percentage points to 
93.6%.
Total headline cost, excluding fuel and including Tegel, is expected to be around GBP4.14 billion. easyJet's total 
fuel cost, including Tegel, for the financial year is expected to be around GBP1.19 billion, including an additional 
GBP15 million cost relating to dollar movement and carbon emissions costs.
easyjet, in addition, expects to record a GBP65 million exceptional charge relating to investments in improving its 
commercial technology platform
TOP NEWS: easyJet Says Annual Profit To Be At Upper End Of Guidance
For 2019, the airliner predicts capacity to grow by 10% to around 105 million seats. Revenue per seat for the first 
half of the new financial year at constant currency is estimated to fall by the low to mid-single digits due to the 
absence of one-off revenue benefits recorded in the previous period.
easyJet's fuel bill for 2019 financial year is likely to increase by GBP55 million to GBP105 million, with the total bill 
expected to be around GBP1.48 billion. Forex movements are expected to dent adjusted pretax profit for the new 
year by GBP10 million.
easyJet intends to declare a full year dividend consistent with its stated policy of paying a dividend equivalent to 
50% of headline earnings per share. 
The company is slated to release its 2018 financial year results on November 20. Shares were trading 0.2% lower 
at 1,322.50 pence each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
RSA Insurance Group reported its UK business suffered an underwriting loss for the third quarter of 2018. UK 
premiums are lower, RSA said, as it takes pricing and re-underwriting action, but international business, such as in 
Scandinavia and Canada, is more positive, it said. The UK made an underwriting loss of around GBP70 million 
during the third quarter, recording a 110% combined ratio. A ratio over 100% represents underwriting losses. The 
company blamed increased weather, large losses, and attritional claims for the disappointing UK performance, with 
its Marine portfolio the worst hit. "RSA's international businesses performed well in the third quarter, making strong 
progress against our best-in-class ambitions," said Chief Executive Stephen Hester, "However, our UK and 'London 
market' business reported an underwriting loss which is disappointing. Actions to improve in the UK are well 
underway and we are determined to restore satisfactory performance whilst continuing our progress internationally."

easyJet expects to deliver a strong performance in final quarter of 2018 financial year and profit for the year will be 
the upper at end of the company's guidance, partly helped by one-off events such as the bankruptcies of rivals

Germany would also be going on strike, with up to 100 flights shelved as a result.
---------
United Utilities said trading in the first half of its financial year was in line with expectations but hot weather drove up 
costs. United Utilities said that in the six months to September its revenue was above the same period last year, 
reflecting regulatory revenue changes. The company incurred higher operating costs during the period, which the 
water and wastewater utility expects to record as an adjusted item. As such, underlying profit for the first half of its 
year is likely to exceed the previous year despite higher-than usual infrastructure renewals expenditure. Net group 
debt is expected to be slightly higher at September 30 than at March 31. However, underlying net finance expense 
is likely to be around GBP30 million below its previous half year. United Utilities said it expects to invest a further 
GBP80 million to safeguard its water supplies. This includes GBP40 million in operating costs and infrastructure 
and GBP40 million in capital expenditure.
----------
Serco said trading in the first few months of the second half will result in a better outcome for 2018, one which will 
be "meaningfully ahead" of current market expectations. The outsourcing company said a strong operating 
performance along with several non-recurring trading items, such as end-of-contract settlements, and other 
commercial negotiations will contribute to the better than expected outcome. Serco is predicting underlying trading 
profit of GBP90 to GBP95 million on revenue of about GBP2.8 billion. Serco's previous guidance for revenue was 
GBP2.7 billion to GBP2.8 billion with underlying trading profit expected to be about GBP80 million. The FTSE 250-
listed company is also expecting its net debt to be towards the lower end of its range, GBP200 million to GBP250 
million, from having previously expected it to be at the mid-to-upper end.
----------
Peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle confirmed it has priced its initial public offering at 440 pence per share. On 
Wednesday last week, Funding Circle set a price range for the IPO between 420p and 530p, so the final price is 
near the bottom of that range. The 440p price will see the company raise gross proceeds of GBP300 million from 
68.2 million new shares. Current shareholders also will sell 32.0 million existing shares, which will raise GBP141 
million for them. Funding Circle expects unconditional dealings to start on the London Stock Exchange on 
Wednesday next week, though conditional dealings began on Friday. The company will have a market capitalisation 
of around GBP1.50 billion, making it a candidate for the FTSE 250 index.
----------
MARKETS
----------
Stocks were mixed in London, with RSA Insurance the worst large-cap performer, down 9.6%. The pound was 
lower against the dollar after a report that the UK economy had its poorest half-year of growth for seven years. Wall 
Street was called for a lower open, having ended higher Thursday after positive economic data.

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK economy has suffered its weakest six-month growth period since 2011, as the figure for the first quarter 
was revised lower. While the second reading for gross domestic product confirmed initial estimates of 0.4% growth 
in the second quarter from the quarter before, the Office for National Statistics said growth was weaker than 
originally thought in the first three months of the year. The ONS has revised quarter-on-quarter GDP growth down 
from 0.2% to 0.1% for the period from January to March this year – a period that saw the UK hit by extreme wintry 
weather brought in by the Beast from the East. The 0.4% quarter-on-quarter estimate for second quarter GDP was 
in line with economist estimates. The annual rise for the second quarter was revised down to 1.2% from 1.3%.
----------
UK consumer confidence weakened in September amid heightened uncertainty surrounding Brexit, survey data 
from GfK showed Friday. The consumer sentiment index dropped to -9 in September from -7 in August. The 
expected score was -8. Four sub-components of the index deteriorated in September and one stayed unchanged. 
The index measuring changes in past personal finances decreased three points to +1. Likewise, the forecast for 
personal finances over the coming 12 months dropped to +5 from +8 a month ago. The measure for the general 
economic situation during the last 12 months fell two points to -28, this was at the same level as September 2017, 
GfK said. Expectations for the general economic situation over the next 12 months edged down one point to -27. 
Meanwhile, the major purchase index stayed the same this month at +6.
----------
Boris Johnson has issued a blistering attack on Theresa May's Brexit strategy just days before the Conservative 
Party conference. The former foreign secretary, who sensationally quit the Cabinet in July, described the prime 
minister's Chequers plan as "a moral and intellectual humiliation for this country" that will "cheat the electorate" if 
implemented. Johnson, in a Telegraph op-ed, accused the government and civil service of a "pretty invertebrate 
performance" in negotiations and said there had been "a collapse of will by the British establishment to deliver on 
the mandate of the people". In a 4,500-word column, entitled "A better plan for Brexit", Johnson also set out an 
alternative vision which he says would make Britain "rich, strong and free". As a priority, the former London mayor 
urged the government to ditch Chequers and negotiate a Canada-style free deal which would "fulfil the instruction of 
the people".
----------
Eurozone inflation accelerated in September on food and energy prices, flash data from Eurostat showed. Inflation 
rose marginally to 2.1%, in line with expectations, from 2% a month ago. The European Central Bank targets 
"below, but close to 2%" inflation. Core inflation that excludes food, alcohol and tobacco, slowed unexpectedly to 
0.9% from 1% in August. The core rate was expected to edge up to 1.1%. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices 
advanced 2.7% in September, following a 2.4% rise in August. Likewise, the increase in energy cost increased to 
9.5% from 9.2%. Non-energy industrial goods prices logged a steady growth of 0.4%. Similarly, services cost 
gained 1.3%, the same rate as seen in August.
----------
Italy will run a higher-than-expected deficit next year, after its economy minister, Giovanni Tria, surrendered 
Thursday to demands to fund expensive tax and welfare programmes via extra borrowing. Deputy Premiers Luigi Di 
Maio and Matteo Salvini, who respectively lead the Five Star Movement and League parties, said a deal was struck 
"with all the government" to set the 2019 deficit at 2.4% of gross domestic product. "We are satisfied, this is a 
budget for change," they said in a joint statement. Tria, a technocrat with no formal political affiliation who was seen 
as a bulwark against reckless spending, wanted to limit the deficit to 1.6% of GDP, keeping Italy's huge public debt 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: RSA Insurance Suffers Storm-Tossed UK Underwriting
in check, as recommended by the EU. The country's public debt is equal to more than 130% of GDP, against a 
eurozone target of 60%. The decision to run a higher deficit is likely to result in a confrontation with EU authorities.

German Cabin Crew Urged To Join Ryanair Strike Amid Cancellations

Frankfurt/DUBLIN (Alliance News) - German cabin crew are being urged to join a day-long strike targeting Ryanair 
flights, trade union Verdi said on Thursday.
It called on some 1,000 Ryanair staff to join pilots on a countrywide strike on Friday in support of higher pay and 
better working conditions at the Dublin-based budget carrier.
"Europe's largest low-cost airline refuses to grant its employees a decent income and a corporate culture free of 
fear as before," Verdi executive Christine Behle said in Berlin.
Several unions across the EU have called for a strike to halt Ryanair flights. Almost 200 flights have been cancelled 
as a result.
The company, long known for its opposition to the unionization of its workforce, has faced repeated strike action 
since the beginning of the year by pilots and cabin crew.
Employees are striking for more pay and better conditions, in line with national law in various countries.
Earlier Thursday, Ryanair marketing head Kenny Jacobs said in Dublin the decision by Germany's Cockpit pilot's 
union to participate would result in 35 to 45 flights to and from Germany not taking off.
The cancelled flights make up some 10% of the Germany schedule. The Dublin-based budget carrier earlier 
announced the cancellation of 150 out of 2,400 European flights for the day.
Ryanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew noted that several workers' rallies were planned.
Ryanair employees from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany are participating in the 
strike, the second pan-European action to hit the company.
German Cabin Crew Urged To Join Ryanair Strike Amid Cancellations
Ryanair has laid a complaint with EU competition authorities alleging that its competitors are behind the coordinated 
action.
The company expressed disappointment that Germany's VC was joining the strike, noting progress made in talks 
with VC on Tuesday, including the appointment of a German mediator.
Bellew said Ryanair was keen to strike a deal within six weeks, with a view to concluding conditions and pay 
contracts by the end of the year.
On Tuesday, the airline said it had signed a new contract with its cabin crew in Italy that will begin on October 1 and 
run for three years.
In Belgium meanwhile, the CNE trade union accused Ryanair of acting "irresponsibly" by failing to cancel enough 
flights on Friday.
Ryanair's behaviour "could create tensions and insecurity for all staff at the airport, at Ryanair and for the 
passengers concerned," the union said in a statement.
Conditions could be particularly bad at Charleroi, Belgium's main airport for low-cost carriers, where 20,000 airline 
passengers could be expected on Friday, CNE said, warning of potential "chaos."
The European Consumer Organization, BEUC, warned that the strikes could leave many passengers without 
compensation.
"We call on Ryanair to compensate consumers caught up in the latest wave of mass cancellations according to EU 
passenger rights rules," said Monique Goyens of BEUC, arguing that many passengers had no "realistic option to 
defend their rights."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it is set to open two new

Ryanair will launch the two new bases in the French cities of Bordeaux and Marseille. Each airport will attract 
USD200 million investment with two based aircraft at each. 
At Bordeaux, 16 new routes will be added taking its total to 24 by the summer of 2019. Meanwhile, the 11 new 
routes introduced at Marseille will see its total grow to 40 routes by summer 2019. 
"We are pleased to open two new French bases in Bordeaux and Marseille, as we base 4 aircraft and invest 
USD400 million at the airports," Ryanair Chief Commericial Officer David O'Brien said. "Our growth will deliver 1.1 
million customers per annum at Bordeaux Airport and 2.4 million customers at Marseille Aiport, while creating 120 
Ryanair jobs across both bases and supporting over 2,500 ancillary jobs in the regions."
Shares in Ryanair were 0.4% lower at EUR13.06 on Thursday.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - The European Commission warned Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on 
Wednesday that the airline must comply with EU rules, as cabin crew members gear up for a mass strike on Friday 
to demand better work conditions.
EU Employment Commissioner Marianne Thyssen and O'Leary had a "frank and open discussion" about 
employment conditions at Ryanair and the current social tensions, commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said. 
Wednesday's meeting had taken place at O'Leary's request.
Thyssen called upon O'Leary to "ensure full compliance with all applicable EU rules and legislation, as it is the case 
for all EU airline companies," Schinas added.
"Respecting EU law is not something over which workers should have to negotiate, nor is it something which can be 
done differently from country to country. I made this very clear to O'Leary today," Thyssen said in a statement.
"I am not against Ryanair or against the low-cost business model. But with great success also comes great 
responsibility," she added.
Staff across Europe have long been at loggerheads with Ryanair due to its practice of employing them under Irish 
labour law. Trade unions in Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands argue that they would receive better 
conditions under their domestic laws.
Ryanair cancelled 150 European flights scheduled for this Friday due to the planned strike, which is the latest in a 
series of industrial actions.
It had originally expected 190 cancellations but issued an updated figure on Wednesday.
The airline argues that the strike is "unnecessary" since it has improved its offer in recent weeks to pilots and cabin 
crews in Ireland, Britain, Italy and Germany.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it has signed a collective labour 
agreement with the main crew unions that cover Ryanair's Italian-based cabin crew, effective from October 1.
The agreement is with unions FIT CISL, ANPAC and ANPAV and will run for three years until the end of 2021.
Governed by Italian law and the Italian courts, the agreement will allow the crew's transition to local contracts over 
an agreed period with immediate access to Italian benefits such as paternity and maternity leave.
In addition, pay will be delivered in a new structure, under which crews will benefit from increased tax free 
allowances. Also, an Italian pension scheme will be introduced.
"We have signed a CLA with the three Italian cabin crew unions, which will cover all of our Italian based cabin crew, 
will lead to significant pay improvements and other benefits for our Italian based cabin crew, and will start from next 
month. This follows recent cabin crew agreements in Ireland with FORSA and in the UK with UNITE," said Chief 
People Officer Eddie Wilson.
"This is a further sign of the significant progress Ryanair is making in reaching agreements with our people and 
their unions in different EU countries, and disproves false claims made by smaller unions not involved in these 
negotiations, and who are threatening strikes, which will either not take place or be unsuccessful," Wilson added.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were down 1.0% at EUR12.91 on Tuesday.

because of strikes by cabin crew in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy and Germany, it said Tuesday.
The flights represent 8% of the 2,400 originally scheduled.
The airline said in a statement that all affected customers have received emails or text messages informing them of 
the cancellation.
About 30,000 customers are likely to be affected out of 450,000 set to travel.
Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs apologised to customers affected by strikes, "which we have done our 
utmost to avoid".
Ryanair cancelled hundreds of flights last year due to problems with pilot scheduling, and strikes have led to more 
cancellations this summer.
The budget airline and pilots have wrangled over working conditions, base transfers and annual leave.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.4% Tuesday afternoon at EUR12.98.

UK Government Warns Of Travel Disruption After A No-Deal Brexit
UK Government Warns Of Travel Disruption After A No-Deal Brexit

LONDON (Alliance News) - Passengers could face flight disruption as well as bus & coach services to EU countries 
being suspended in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK government has warned. 
If the UK withdraws from the EU without an agreement then airlines will have to obtain individual permissions to 
operate between the UK and the EU, according to new guidance.
The warning was contained in a tranche of 24 technical papers released by government departments on Monday 
advising businesses and consumers on potential impacts of a no-deal Brexit.
The document states that the UK "would envisage" allowing EU airlines to continue flying and "we would expect EU 
countries to reciprocate in turn", according to the document.
It added: "It would not be in the interest of any EU country or the UK to restrict the choice of destinations that could 
be served, though if such permissions are not granted, there could be disruption to some flights."
Bus and coach services could also be suspended in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
UK coach operators have been advised to consider subcontracting "all or part of the coach travel" on the continent 
to EU-based operators as no deal would mean operators could no longer rely on automatic recognition by the EU of 
UK-issued community licences.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has repeatedly warned that flights could be grounded if an aviation deal is not 
reached as part of the Brexit negotiations.
The government insists a no-deal Brexit "remains unlikely given the mutual interests of the UK and the EU".
Luton-based carrier easyJet created an Austrian division in July 2017 to allow it to fly between EU countries after 
Brexit.
UK Government Warns Of Travel Disruption After A No-Deal Brexit
Flights between the UK and 17 non-EU countries, such as the US, Canada, Switzerland and Iceland, currently 
operate due to the UK being a member of the EU.
The guidance states that "replacement arrangements will be in place before exit day".
The UK has already reached agreements with a number of these countries and is "confident the remaining 
agreements will be agreed well in advance of the UK leaving the EU".
The notice for coach operators says ministers are seeking to negotiate continued membership of the Interbus 
Agreement, which would allow occasional services for the likes of holiday operators, but this "cannot be 
guaranteed".
The paper says: "The government considers the likelihood of failing to achieve UK membership of Interbus by 
March 29 2019, or very soon thereafter, to be low. But if this occurs for any reason, it would be likely that no UK 
operators would be able to take coach services into the EU at least in the short term.
"UK operators who are taking travel bookings which involve coach travel in Europe after March 29 2019 may wish 
to consider contractual terms with their customers that allow them to subcontract all or part of the coach travel to 
EU-based operators if necessary."
The technical notice says the UK will permit EU buses and coaches to continue bringing passengers into and out of 
the UK to minimise any potential disruption to passengers.
"This will ensure, for example, that EU tourists and students would not be stopped from visiting the UK if there is 
any delay to joining the Interbus Agreement."
Operators are also warned there are likely to be new requirements at borders with the EU in the event of no deal, 
and there could be impacts for coaches using EU ports.
The paper says: "In the event of delays, caused by increased checks at EU ports, the UK Government would 
implement contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic."
The notice says further communications will be issued later in the autumn.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Aberdeen Standard Investments warned at Ryanair Holdings PLC's annual general 
meeting on Thursday it could vote against the re-election of certain directors in the future.
Aberdeen Standard Investments manages around 11 million shares in the low-cost airline, equivalent to a 0.9% 
stake.
Alison Kennedy, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said the asset manager has been a 
"long term and supportive" shareholder in the company and instructed its proxy to vote in favour of all resolutions at 
Thursday's AGM.
"Ryanair is a highly successful business and has managed to sustain a high rate of growth which has benefitted 
passengers, employees and shareholders alike. To achieve this, the company has had to change and evolve but it 
is currently going through a period when that evolution is proving more challenging," said Kennedy.
The resolutions Aberdeen Standard Investments voted in favour of included those to re-elect Non-Executive 
Chairman David Bonderman and Senior Independent Director Kyran McLaughlin, who have served on the board for 
22 and 17 years respectively. 
"We thought long and hard before reaching that decision. The length of time both have been on the board suggests 
a lack of focus on board succession planning; excessive tenure also calls into question an individual's 
independence and objectivity," said Kennedy.
She added that Aberdeen Standard Investments's engagement on governance matters suggests the board is not 
listening "carefully" enough to shareholder views.
However, the asset manager was aware of the "unintended consequences" that could follow should the two 
members be voted off the board at this time.
Aberdeen Standard Investments Warns Of Future Ryanair AGM Dissent
Kennedy said: "That said, given the challenges the company faces, for example in union and labour relations, it is 
clear that governance needs to evolve. Strong, independent and visible board leadership is more important than 
ever."
Aberdeen Standard Investments therefore expects Ryanair to make "clear progress" on succession for these two 
"key" board positions by the AGM next year.
If not, Kennedy cautioned, Aberdeen Standard Investments will vote against the re-election of Bonderman, 
McLaughlin and the other members of the nominations committee.
At Thursday's AGM, 70.5% of votes were in favour of the re-election of Bonderman and 66.8% in favour of the re-
election of McLaughlin.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.1% at EUR13.60 on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Chief Executive Michael O'Leary on Thursday warned of a rising 
risk of a no-deal Brexit, claiming the Irish border backstop was "undeliverable".
O'Leary predicted potential political "chaos" in Britain and said if the UK crashed out, flights would need to be 
cancelled a month in advance of next March's withdrawal.
He said: "We are selling tickets between the UK and Europe … on flights that may not take place."
Ireland believes last December's agreement in principle between the UK and EU will keep Northern Ireland within 
the EU's regulatory arrangements if negotiations fail.
Mr O'Leary focused his comments on Britain's role in the negotiations, rather than Ireland's.
The outspoken Ryanair chief has been strongly critical of Brexit. He thought a deal would be done eventually but 
reiterated that there was a real danger of no-deal by omission.
Risk factors included if Theresa May was replaced as Prime Minister, or a general election was called.
"There is a rising risk, if the deal is not done by about November then, frankly, it will not get done at all," said 
O'Leary.
"Doing a deal is going to be very difficult," he added.
O'Leary expressed concern about the Irish border.
"The backstop agreement is undeliverable, there is no way you can deliver a frictionless border if you are leaving a 
common market – it is not deliverable."
He added: "There are going to be real and serious consequences, both in the UK economy and in the European 
economy.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary Warns Over Rising Risk Of No-Deal Brexit
"From my narrow perspective all I want to see is a continuation of open skies and free flights, cheap flights."
The British cannot deliver what they have proposed unless they have a border down the Irish Sea, he said.
"It is not Leo (Varadkar), it is not the Irish Government's challenge to come up with a resolution, it is the British 
Government's."
O'Leary addressed other challenges ahead for the airline – including costs.
He said: "Oil is still going to be the most significant cost for every airline, but I would like to see oil prices go higher 
this winter because I think it would speed up the inevitable bankruptcy of a number of other European airlines.
"It would create more opportunity for us to grow."

Stobart Southend Airport Passenger Number Rises By 37% In First Half
Stobart Southend Airport Passenger Number Rises By 37% In First Half

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stobart Group Ltd said Thursday that passenger numbers at London Southend Airport 
increased by 37% in the first half of its financial year.
The infrastructure & support services company, which owns Southend airport, said it focused on improving 
awareness through branding and marketing, route development, and airline deals.
A new agreement with Ryanair Holdings PLC will see the Irish budget airline start flying from Southend in Spring 
2019. The deal is expected to add "at least" one million passengers in the first year.
Furthermore, a deal with the Restaurant Group PLC to add six new food & beverage brands "will help maximise the 
commercial value" of the increased number of passengers.
"The agreement with Ryanair gives us further confidence that we will deliver on our aim to welcome five million 
passengers a year to the airport by 2022," Stobart said, as it expects the Aviation division to deliver broadly in line 
with the board's views. 
Meanwhile, the company expects the results of its Energy division to be "slightly below expectations in the short 
term" on the back of delays in commissioning of third-party energy plants which put pressure on the supply chain. 
"However, the investment in best in class infrastructure, including cutting-edge IT systems, means that Stobart 
Energy is well positioned to deliver strong profitability per tonne when energy plants are operating to target," it 
added.
The company's Rail & Civils arm is expected to deliver results lower than expectations after the company reviewed 
its revenue recognition on long-term contracts and adopted a more prudent approach.
Chief Executive Officer Warwick Brady said: "We are reviewing all aspects of the group to ensure we are well 
placed to deliver the ambitious growth targets set by the board to double the value of the business. 
Stobart Southend Airport Passenger Number Rises By 37% In First Half
"We are confident that we can meet our commitment to shareholders to unify the business and provide the 
framework for the delivery of the company's strategy to the benefit of all stakeholders."
The company will publish its interim results for the six months to August 31 on October 24. 
Stobart shares were trading down 0.8% at 240.56 pence each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holding PLC on Thursday said Chairman David Bonderman was re-elected 
with 70.5% of votes, compared to 89% votes in favour last year.
Meanwhile, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary was supported by 98.5% of shareholders, slightly down from 99% of 
votes in favour that he get last year.
Ryanair shares were trading 0.3% lower on Thursday at EUR13.72 each.
According to the media reports, several investors, including Royal London Asset Management and Britain's Local 
Authority Pension Fund Forum, said that they will vote against Bonderman's re-election, citing Ryanair's poor 
treatment of staff and the need for the company's board renewal.
During the year, the company saw a series of industrial actions across Europe, organised by its cabin crew and pilot 
unions, who tried to push for better pay and conditions for their members.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said the French Supreme Court has forced 
French authorities to accept and respect the Irish E101 tax certificates held by its Marseilles-based pilots. 
The FTSE 250-listed budget airline said the French Supreme Court also cancelled all convictions against Ryanair 
and returned the case to the Paris Court of Appeal for rehearing. 
The French court decision follows a ruling by the European Court of Justice upholding EU rules on social insurance 
payments for international transport workers. In April last year, Ryanair said it has paid in "double taxes" in Ireland 
and France during the period between 2006 and 2010.
The company said it now expects the repayment of up to EUR13 million of social tax payments, which it was 
required to put into escrow to cover two criminal cases in 2014 and 2017.
"We welcome this French Supreme Court ruling, which now paves the way for Ryanair to consider re-entering the 
French market," said Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson.
"We are already in discussions with a number of French airports, and the French Ministry of Labour, which we hope 
will lead to Ryanair announcing some bases in France in the near future," added Wilson. 
Shares in Ryanair were trading 1.4% higher on Wednesday at EUR13.78 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC shareholders are being urged to replace the airline's chief 
executive and chairman at the company's annual meeting on Thursday.
The British Airline Pilots Association said the relationship between Ryanair management and pilots has become 
"utterly dysfunctional", risking the continued success of the company.
Ryanair has been hit by strikes by pilots across Europe in a long running dispute over working practices.
Balpa said in a statement that Chief Executive Michael O'Leary and Chairman David Bonderman should be 
replaced.
The statement read: "Management's actions to date are often perceived by pilots as being frequently intimidating 
and antagonistic. It is also seen as generating operational disruption and industrial unrest rather than creating a 
positive and cohesive working environment for the future.
"As professional pilots, critical to the future and fortunes of our airline, many have lost all confidence in Michael 
O'Leary and his ability to lead the company as CEO.
"This failure of leadership is compounded by an apparent lack of oversight from the board, from its chairman and 
from non-executive directors, which has allowed the current negative situation and ongoing uncertainty to grow.
"Accordingly, as stakeholders in Ryanair, with shared interest in the health and success of the company, Ryanair's 
pilots urge shareholders to immediately replace the CEO Michael O'Leary and chairman David Bonderman at the 
annual general meeting."
Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said: "The industrial unrest in Ryanair across Europe and among pilots and 
cabin crew is, in my opinion, likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
Pilots Urge Ryanair Shareholders To Oust Chairman And Chief Executive
"The reason is as follows – there is a lot of pent up frustration in Ryanair over a management style that has been 
seen as bullying and aggressive. The staff want that to end and they want respect.
"Ryanair's announcement last December that they would recognise unions should have been the opportunity to 
make a break from the past but the trust in management isn't there to support the words.
"For many pilots and cabin crew it seems to me that they do not believe in the intentions of Ryanair's leaders and 
unfortunately O'Leary is usually cited as the cause of this.
"I think that while he is still there as the embodiment of Ryanair's values the distrust among many staff is likely to 
continue and with it the industrial unrest."

FRANKFURT (Alliance News) - Deutsche Lufthansa AG on Friday recalled nine planes it has leased to 
Laudamotion, a day after Ryanair Holdings PLC was given the go-ahead by EU competition authorities to take over 
the Austrian budget carrier.
Justifying the step, Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, said Laudamotion had "repeatedly 
failed to make the agreed payments." The recall has yet to take effect.
The nine planes make up almost half the fleet of Laudamotion, the former Air Berlin subsidiary that used to be 
known as Niki.
Lufthansa, which had wanted to buy Niki from Air Berlin but withdrew from the bidding in December last year, said it 
could make good use of the planes in its own budget carrier, Eurowings.
Speaking to Austrian news agency APA, Laudamotion Chief Executive Andreas Gruber insisted it had paid all its 
bills related to the planes.
The payments for July had been met at the end of June, and all nine planes were in full use, Gruber said.
Dublin-based Ryanair accused Lufthansa of delaying payments of EUR1.5 million to Laudamotion, terming the 
cancellation of the leases as yet another attempt by Lufthansa "to destabilize and cause damage."
It also said Lufthansa had failed to make available all the planes promised. Lufthansa rejected this.
The European Commission gave the takeover the go-ahead without setting any conditions.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said it agreed a set of principles with three major 
Italian cabin crew unions after a meeting in Rome.
The budget airline signed the principles, which form part of a collective labour agreement covering Ryanair's Italian 
cabin crew, on Thursday. The main three cabin crew unions in Italy, ANPAV, ANPAC, and FIT CISL, were involved 
in the deal.
Under the new agreement, which will be governed by Italian law and spans three years, Italian cabin crew workers 
will be able to transition to local contracts and will see increased pay under a new structure. An Italian pension 
scheme will be also be introduced as part of the agreement.
"This agreement follows recent cabin crew agreements in Ireland with FORSA and in the UK with UNITE," said 
Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson.
"This agreement is a further sign of the significant progress Ryanair is making in reaching agreements with our 
people and their unions in different EU countries, and disproves false claims made by smaller unions not involved in 
these negotiations, and who are threatening strikes later this winter, which will either not take place or be 
unsuccessful," Wilson added.
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.9% at 13.30 pence on Friday.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets remained stuck in a sideways pattern 
throughout Friday's session. 
Despite the lackluster trading action, the majority of the markets ended the day with slight gains.
Traders were encouraged by reports that another round of talks between the US and China could take place in the 
near future.
Concerns about emerging markets also eased somewhat after Turkey's central bank raised its key interest rate 
sharply in a dramatic bid to control rocketing inflation and prevent a currency crisis.
The Bank of France on Friday cut its economic growth forecast for this year through 2020 amid the less dynamic 
and more uncertain external situation.
GDP growth would be 1.6% this year, next year and in 2020, the bank said.
Previously, the bank projected 1.8% growth for 2018 and 1.7% expansion in 2019.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.4%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks

Friday. Hourly labor cost advanced 2.2% from previous year following a 2.1% rise in the first quarter.
China's industrial production and retail sales growth improved in August, while investment growth slowed down, 
indicating the weakness in the economic momentum.
Industrial production climbed 6.1% year-on-year in August, in line with expectations, but slightly faster than the 6% 
increase seen in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed Friday.
Retail sales growth improved to 9% in August from 8.8% in July. The rate was expected to remain unchanged at 
8.8%.
Partly reflecting a drop in sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, the Commerce Department released a report on 
Friday showing retail sales in the US increased by much less than expected in the month of August.
The Commerce Department said retail sales inched up by 0.1% in August after climbing by an upwardly revised 
0.7% in July. Economists had expected retail sales to rise by 0.4% compared to the 0.5% increase originally 
reported for the previous month.
Import prices in the US fell by much more than expected in the month of August, according to a report released by 
the Labor Department on Friday.
The Labor Department said import prices dropped by 0.6% in August after edging down by a revised 0.1% in July.

BERLIN (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC was set to resume operations on Thursday 
following a 24-hour strike that caused the carrier to cancel 150 of its 400 flights to and from Germany the previous 
day.
Operations chief Peter Bellew was optimistic that most of Ryanair's 400 flights to and from Germany would resume 
on Thursday after strike action ended at 2.59 am (0059 GMT).
German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit and German workers union Verdi organized the strike in an effort to push 
for better pay and conditions for their members.
Ryanair's hubs at Frankfurt (Hahn) and Berlin-Schoenefeld were most affected by the cancellations.
The airline dismissed the industrial action as unjustified, citing offers it has already put on the table. German 
Ryanair employees had also walked out for a day in August.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary Wednesday said Ryanair would not "roll over" because of a one-day 
strike which he termed "somewhat unsuccessful."
O'Leary accused the unions of making a "ludicrous demand" earlier this year for a 42% pay increase.
Strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of this 
year's summer holiday season.
Italy, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are among the other countries where 
Ryanair pilots and cabin staff have taken strike action.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday rejected "false" claims made 
by Belgian union CNE that strike action by its "small minority" of cabin crew would cause "travel chaos".
The strike action is expected to take place on September 28 across Europe. 
Ryanair highlighted that it expects the "vast majority" of its cabin crew in Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and 
Portugal to work "normally", despite another "limited" cabin crew strike.
"Repeated false claims made by these unions about 'travel chaos' have proven to be unfounded," said Chief 
Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs.
The company referred to its experience during previous strikes in the summer, which included five days of strikes 
by less than 25% of its Irish pilots. On each of the strike days Ryanair said it completed 280 of its 300 flights to and 
from Ireland, as over three quarters of its Irish pilots continued to work normally.
"While we regret the limited strike actions that have taken place this summer, in all cases we have judiciously pre-
cancelled a small number of our 2,500 daily flights in order to minimise customer disruption and inconvenience," 
Jacobs added.
On Wednesday, German pilots unions Vereinigung Cockpit and Verdi  took strike action, which a union 
spokesperson said was attended by majority of Ryanair's 400 pilots in Germany and around 1,000 flight attendants. 
However, Ryanair on Thursday said over 70% of Ryanair's German-based pilots and cabin crew reported for work 
on Wednesday, and it completed over 250 of its daily schedule of 400 flights. The company said 150 flights had 
been pre-cancelled on Tuesday, with the "small group" of affected passengers being re-accommodated or 
refunded.
"If there is a further unsuccessful cabin crew strike on September 28 next then, as we demonstrated in Germany 
yesterday, Ryanair will pre-advise customers of a small number of flight cancellations, and the overwhelming

majority of Ryanair’s flights and services that day will operate as normal, and we will carry the overwhelming 
majority of the 400,000 passengers who will be scheduled to fly with us that day," said Jacobs.
Ryanair shares were trading down 0.4% on Thursday at EUR13.14 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is 
being underestimated and could lead to flights being grounded for days or weeks. 
"We remain concerned at the increasing risk of a hard no-deal Brexit in March 2019," Chief Executive Officer 
Michael O'Leary said.
He added: "While we hope that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 will be agreed, recent events in 
the UK have added uncertainty, and we believe that the risk of a hard Brexit is being underestimated." 
Furthermore the company said it added 23 new routes to and from London in its "biggest ever" S2019 schedule.
The airline said the schedule, which now includes 180 routes from London, will deliver 26 million customers per 
year across its four London airports, Stansted, Luton, Southend and Gatwick.
Last week, the company complained to the European Commission over "discrimination" by NATS at Stansted 
airport after the British air traffic controller refused to explain why 52% of all London air traffic control delays in the 
first quarter were at Stansted. 
"In the same period there were zero such delays at Heathrow and just 10% at Gatwick where NATS' shareholders 
BA and Easyjet PLC are the main airlines," Ryanair said.
"We call on the UK Government and EU to take prompt action against NATS who continue to deliver an atrocious 
service to airlines despite having amongst the highest air traffic control fees in the EU, and who are blatantly 
protecting Heathrow at the expense of all other London airports, especially Stansted," the airline concluded.
Ryanair was forced to cancel 150 of its 400 flights to and from Germany on Wednesday due to a 24-hour strike by 
German pilots and flights attendants. The strike is being organized by German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit and 
German workers union Verdi in an effort to push for better pay and conditions for their members.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are set to open broadly flat on Wednesday, with trade tensions 
rumbling on in the background but oil majors poised to benefit from an overnight rise in oil prices.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 1.06 points higher at 7,274.60 on Wednesday. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.1%, or 5.76 points at 7,273.54 on Tuesday.
"Wall Street traded higher overnight shrugging off trade tensions, amid rallying tech stocks led by Apple and a 2% 
gain in oil prices, Meanwhile Europe is looking to take the lead from the US with European bourses broadly looking 
to start the session on the front foot," said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended higher after a slightly negative start, with the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average rising 0.4%, the S&P 500 also gaining 0.4% and Nasdaq Composite advancing 0.6%.
Meanwhile, oil was quoted at USD79.35 a barrel early Wednesday, up from USD78.65 late Tuesday.
Lawler explained: "A combination of falling oil inventories, looming Iranian sanctions hitting output and hurricane 
Florence which is expected to hit the US east coast and disrupt the energy market boosted oil in early trade."
US sanctions against Iran are set to come into effect in the first week of November, with exports from Iran expected 
to fall by nearly 40%. In addition, hurricane Florence - which is is expected to strengthen into a near-Category 5 
storm as it approaches North and South Carolina - could cause flooding and power interruptions and result in the 
shutting down of Colonial Pipeline.
In UK political news, Theresa May's roles as UK prime minister was under fresh pressure after Tory MPs spent 
nearly an hour war-gaming how to oust her at a private meeting.
Around 50 MPs discussed ways and means of getting rid of the UK prime minister at a gathering of the European 
Research Group, the Press Association understands.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Flat Call; Supply, Florence Worries Lift Oil
A number of MPs told how they had already submitted letters of no confidence to Graham Brady, chairman of the 
1922 Committee, and others discussed plans to follow suit. If 48 letters are handed over a vote of no confidence 
would be triggered.
The flurry of activity came after former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launched a fresh attack on May's Brexit 
plan, claiming it would be "substantially worse than the status quo" for British businesses.
In early UK company news, Ryanair pilots and flights attendants are taking part in a 24-hour strike that started at 
3.01 am local time in Germany on Wednesday, which has caused the budget airline to cancel 150 of its 400 flights 
to and from Germany.
The strike is being organized by German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit and German workers union Verdi in an 
effort to push for better pay and conditions for their members.
In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index is down 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 
0.2%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is 0.4% lower.
In the corporate calendar on Wednesday, housebuilder Galliford Try and home furnishings retailer Dunelm publish

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish discount airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Friday that it will restore six Dublin-
based aircraft which were due to be transferred to Poland in November, after reaching an agreement with an Irish 
pilots union on Wednesday.
"The related protective notices issued to 300 Dublin pilots and cabin crew in July have also been withdrawn today," 
the company said.
The decision was taken in response of a favourable "mediation agreement" which ended "five days of unsuccessful 
but damaging strikes" by less than 25% of Ryanair's Irish-based pilots in July and August, the company said.
Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said: "We regret that mediation became necessary after five days of 
unsuccessful strikes which, despite causing minimal damage to Ryanair's schedules, did damage our forward fares 
and yields to and from Ireland because of the perception of possible disruptions."
Wilson continued: "Since December last year, when the board announced that we would recognise unions, 
Ryanair's people have enjoyed significant pay increases, improved terms and conditions, and we have agreed to 
improved seniority structures, base transfers and annual leave. We have done this in a year when we expect profits 
to fall by 15% due to a combination of higher fuel prices and higher staff costs."
In July, the company announced it was cutting six planes from its Dublin-based fleet for the winter 2018 season, 
leading to potential 300 jobs losses.
On Wednesday, however, the Irish Airline Pilots' Association voted to accept Ryanair's agreement, potentially 
ending a long-running labour dispute that resulted in several strikes this summer.
The union accused Ryanair of attempted "union busting" in July after the airline warned that it could cut 100 pilots 
and 200 cabin crew from its staff in Ireland as it reduces its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.
Ryanair shares were trading down 1.7% at EUR13.34 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - An Irish pilots union voted to accept an agreement with budget airline Ryanair Holdings 
PLC on Wednesday, potentially ending a long-running labour dispute that resulted in several strikes this summer.
The Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) said its members voted unanimously to accept the deal, which follows 
mediated negotiations between the two sides last month.
The pilots had objected to Ryanair's plans to change seniority rules and were unhappy with its procedures for 
annual leave, transfers, and promotions.
The union said the deal could be "the first step towards providing transparency and fairness for Ryanair pilots while 
also assisting Ryanair in recruiting and retaining pilots in the future."
"While our members fully respect Ryanair's operational model, they no longer accept the company's highly 
problematic employment model," IALPA spokesman Joe May said.
The union accused Ryanair of attempted "union busting" in July after the airline warned that it could cut 100 pilots 
and 200 cabin crew from its staff in Ireland as it reduces its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.
In a statement on Wednesday, Ryanair welcomed the union's vote and said it would ask the company's board to 
"reconsider their decision to re-base six aircraft away from Dublin this winter."
Strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights this summer.
Italy, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are among the other countries where 
Ryanair pilots and cabin staff have taken strike action.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline companies Wizz Air Holdings PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC said 
Tuesday that passenger numbers increased year-on-year in the month of August, despite continued pilot strikes 
and air traffic controller staff shortages across Europe.
Eastern-Europe focused carrier Wizz Air said the number of passengers carried in August increased 20% on the 
same period a year ago to 3.5 million from 2.9 million. On a rolling 12-month basis, Wizz Air saw passenger 
numbers up 23% to 32.3 million.
In August, Wizz Air added 20 new routes including flight to and from Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Kosovo, Hungary, 
Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, which boosted the month's capacity numbers by 20% to 3.6 million. For the year-
to-date, the airline's capacity grew 22% to 35.2 million seats.
Ryanair's August traffic was up 9% to 13.8 million, including recent acquisition Lauda, from 12.7 million compared 
to the same month a year prior, despite staff shortages and pilot strikes causing almost 550 flights cancellations 
during the month. In August 2017 only 27 flights were cancelled.
"Regrettably, over 100,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in August because of repeated air traffic 
control staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France, and one day of unnecessary pilot strikes," the Irish low-cost 
airline said.
It continued: "Ryanair, together with other European airlines, calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and 
Governments to correct these ATC staff shortages which are disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe's 
consumers this summer."
Lauda, Ryanair's Austrian airline in partnership with Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda, saw traffic at 500,000 
passengers with a 92% load factor. This was the first time Lauda's figures were included in Ryanair's reports after 
announcing the deal to buy an initial 24.9% stake in March.

Wizz Air August load factor was up by 0.2 percentage point to 95.6% while Ryanair's was unchanged at 97% on the 
back of "even lower fares", the airline said.
Ryanair shares were trading up 1.1% at EUR14.28, while Wizz Air shares were trading up 0.7% at 3,185.00 pence 
each early Tuesday.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European markets ended Tuesday's session firmly in negative 
territory as traders were in a cautious mood due to continued worries over global trade. 
Recent reports have suggested that US President Donald Trump plans to move ahead with tariffs on USD200 
billion worth of Chinese imports as early as this week.
US and Canadian officials failed to reach an agreement on trade last week, with talks expected to resume this 
week. Trump threatened on Saturday that the US would go it alone with Mexico on a revised agreement or to 
terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement entirely.
"There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal," he tweeted, "If we don't make a fair deal 
for the US after decades of abuse, Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere with these negotiations or I 
will simply terminate NAFTA entirely & we will be far better off," he added.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.70%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 1.06%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.76%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 1.10% and the CAC of France fell 1.31%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 0.62% 
and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.57%.
In Frankfurt, wind turbines maker Nordex Group jumped 1.17% after winning an order for 99 MW project from 
Argentina.
In Paris, re-insurer Scor soared 9.53% after it rejected a friendly takeover offer by Covea.
In London, advertising giant WPP sank 6.27% after it expressed concern about underperforming operations in the 
US.
Low-cost airline Ryanair declined 2.44% after its August total traffic grew by 9% to 13.8 million customers.

Eurozone producer price inflation accelerated on energy prices in July, figures from Eurostat showed Tuesday. 
Producer prices advanced 4% year-on-year in July, following a 3.6% rise in June. Prices were expected to gain 
3.9% in July.
UK construction activity expanded at the weakest pace in three months in August largely mirroring lack of new work 
on infrastructure projects, survey data from IHS Markit showed Tuesday.
The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell notably 
to 52.9 in August from July's 14-month peak of 55.8. The score was also below the expected 54.9.
UK like-for-like sales increased slightly in August, figures from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG showed 
Tuesday. Like-for-like sales rose slightly by 0.2% year-on-year in August. At the same time, total sales advanced 
1.3% annually.
Activity in the US manufacturing sector unexpectedly grew at a faster rate in the month of August, according to a 
report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index climbed to 61.3 in August from 58.1 in July, with a reading above 50 
indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had expected the index to dip to 57.7.
A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed a modest uptick in construction spending in 
the US in the month of July. The Commerce Department said construction spending inched up by 0.1% to an 
annual rate of USD1.315 trillion in July after falling by 0.8% to a revised rate of USD1.314 trillion in June.
Economists had expected construction to rise by 0.5% compared to the 1.1% slump originally reported for the 
previous month.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Citi took a bullish stance on easyJet, Ryanair Holdings and International Consolidated 
Airlines Group citing favourable demand saying the UK airlines can thrive amid a challenged outlook for the sector.
Citi said the economic cycle is key for cyclical sectors such as airlines as it influences levels of demand for airline 
company's services. 
In addition, Citi said airlines are behaving like classic "cyclical" stocks and think their performance in relation to the 
sector will continue to be closely aligned to dollar moves.
"Share prices are sensitive to a variety of influences, including macro forces and bottom-up fundamentals. Airlines' 
share prices are sensitive to the economic cycle, ie Buy early/start, Sell late/end. But, in the last 2 to 3 years, the 
relative performance of the sector has been most closely tied to USD index movements," Citi analysts said. 
Citi's house view is for further strength in the dollar for the remainder of 2018 and reversing in 2019. As such, the 
bank took a positive view on easyJet, Ryanair and IAG.
Citi started coverage on easyJet with a Buy rating over the budget airline's strong pricing momentum, aggressive 
cost-cutting drive and synergies from Air Berlin fleet acquisition.  
The US bank placed a 1,800 pence price target on the stock. Shares in easyJet were up 0.2% at 1,532.00p on 
Friday.
"We see strong near-term growth potential for easyJet, driven by a combination of a material reduction in 
competitor growth on its network driving strong pricing, and its fuel hedging," Citi analysts said. 
Citi suggested the market is underestimating the benefits from easyJet's purchase of assets of German airline Air 
Berlin in December. As a result of the acquisition, easyJet now operates 25 aircraft from Berlin Tegel Airport. 
IN THE KNOW: Citi Backs easyJet , Ryanair And IAG To Fly High
"We see the company in 2019 producing cost savings of GBP30 million due to efficiencies related to wet leases 
migration and other cost savings. Moreover, we see revenue and yield management (via route changes) resulting in 
a further GBP80 million upside to revenue. Both these factors, we feel, are being overlooked by consensus to a 
degree," the analysts said. 
Moreover, Citi feels easyJet management will likely be conservative over its targets for its 2019 financial year, 
underpinned by concerns about potential pricing dilution from the Berlin deal and the CEO's
strategy of investing for growth, as opposed to focusing on cost.
"We feel this conservatism around pricing will ultimately prove to be flawed, in light of the favourable supply 
dynamics impacting easyJet's core UK market," the analysts said.
Citi started coverage on Ryanair with a Buy rating over the Irish carrier's better than expected top-line growth 
momentum, market share gains and reshaped strategic approach. 
The US bank placed a EUR16.80 price target on the stock. Ryanair shares were down 0.4% at EUR14.22.
Earlier this month, Ryanair reported annual revenue of EUR7.20 billion, up from EUR6.50 billion the prior year. 
Pretax profit grew to EUR1.60 billion from EUR1.40 billion.
Notably, in terms of passenger volume terms and profitability, Ryanair is Europe's largest short-haul airline.
Citi said Ryanair has a strong business model for a European airline in terms of its lowest-cost advantage, 
continued growth prospects and strong balance sheet. The bank's analysts also highlighted that Ryanair's growth 
prospects are enhanced by its outstanding orders for 275 Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737-8 MAX future 
technology aircraft.
"The UK and Western European markets are nearing maturity in terms of the penetration of low-fare
airlines and Ryanair's ability to stimulate volume with low prices; however, there are still opportunities throughout 
the rest of Europe, which we expect Ryanair to exploit, taking market share from weaker airlines and down-sizing 
flag carriers," the bank's analysts said.
Citi also expects Ryanair to generate strong good earnings per share growth to financial 2021 and sustainable free 
cash flow generation, resulting in expected special dividends and share buybacks.
"Moreover away from fare pricing, we see the recent acceleration in ancillary revenues as being sustained through 
a number of near-term initiatives, in particular, the new incentive structure at Ryanair Rooms, baggage handling fee 
changes and legacy seat charging," the analysts added.
Citi started coverage on IAG with a Buy rating saying the British Airways parent company over its robust North 
Atlantic corporate pricing. 
In addition to BA, the company also owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling and Ireland's Aer Lingus. It is the 
second-largest European airline group in terms of revenue.  
Citi predicated its positive stance on IAG's pricing still going strong in the North Atlantic corporate market, which is a 
core driver of profitability for BA and IAG as a whole. 
IAG also has a unique structural position in a capacity constrained UK market, in particular flying from its Heathrow 
airport base, which the analysts identified as a further positive. 
Earlier this month, IAG posted half year pretax profit of EUR1.65 billion, up from the EUR758 million reported in the 
comparative period a year ago.

Furthermore, in July IAG's traffic - measured in revenue passenger kilometres - increased to 26.60 billion from 
24.74 billion the same month in 2017. The highest traffic improvement was reported in North America, up 12%.
The US bank also placed a EUR9.07 price target on the stock. IAG shares were flat at 695.00p. 
"Our target price is driven by upside earnings revision potential of 15%, with the major underpinnings being better 
than expected revenue momentum. Beyond vanilla earnings momentum, we substantiate the target prices further 
via an asset based multiples," the analysts said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it now recognised an Ireland-
based cabin crew as it continues the process of engaging with unions more closely.
Ryanair recognised Forsa which will now be the representative body for all directly employed cabin crew operating 
on its aircraft in Ireland.
"We are pleased to sign this cabin crew recognition agreement with Forsa in Ireland," said Chief People Officer 
Eddie Wilson. 
The Forsa move follows Ryanair's recognition of a number of unions following a decision to do so in December last 
year for the purposes of agreeing collective labour agreements.
"This is a further sign of the progress Ryanair is making with trade unions since our December 2017 decision to 
recognise unions, with over 65% of our cabin crew now covered by recognition agreements, and we hope to sign 
more agreements in the coming weeks," added Wilson.
In early June, Ryanair signed a recognition deal with Italian unions ANPAV for cabin crew operating in that country. 
Shortly after, Ryanair also signed a similar pact with UK union Unite.
Back in July, the airline recognised the Ver.di Union which covers the German market.
Shares in Ryanair were trading 0.3% lower on Thursday at EUR14.42 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said Italian pilots have voted 
"overwhelmingly" in favour of a new collective labour agreement.
The CLA was agreed by Ryanair and the Italian Airline Pilots Association earlier in August. 
This comes after Irish trade union FORSA reached an agreement with Ryanair last Thursday, with Irish pilots set to 
vote on the deal shortly. 
Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said: "We welcome this first CLA with our Italian pilots and hope it will be 
shortly followed by a similar agreement covering our Irish pilots. We have invited our UK, German and Spanish 
unions to meet with us in the coming days so we can negotiate and hopefully agree similar pilot CLAs in these other 
larger markets. 
"These agreements demonstrate the real progress being made by Ryanair in its negotiations with its pilots and their 
unions across different EU markets."
Ryanair shares were 3.0% higher Tuesday at EUR14.30 apiece.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London ended mixed on Thursday, as a fall in heavyweight mining stocks 
impeded gains in the FTSE 100, as the US and China's tit-for-tat trade war intensified.
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2%, or 11.02 points at 7,563.22. The FTSE 250 ended up 0.1%, or 22.97 
points, at 20,665.47, and the AIM All-Share closed up 0.1%, or 7.75 points, at 1,092.55.
The Cboe UK 100 closed down 0.2% at 12,818.30, the Cboe UK 250 closed up 0.2% at 18,771.98, and the Cboe 
UK Small Companies closed down 0.1% at 12,330.33.
"Despite briefly spiking above 7,600, the FTSE 100 was unable to retain its strength and moved into negative 
territory towards the end of the session. An escalation of trade tensions between the US and China hit metal prices 
pulling miners lower," said City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta.
China retaliated in the same measure against the US government's decision to impose 25% import duty on 
additional Chinese products worth USD16 billion, escalating a trade war between the two economic powerhouses.
The US has applied new tariffs to a vast range of goods in 279 product categories, including children's cots and 
bedding, animal medicines, semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, shrimps and shrimp 
products, handbags and fridges.
China responded immediately with tariffs on 333 US products worth USD16 billion. They include coal, copper scrap, 
fuel, buses, cars, medical equipment, Harley motorcycles, bourbon and orange juice.
US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tried to downplay the counter-effects in an interview on CNBC.

"Naturally they'll retaliate a little bit. But at the end of the day, we have many more bullets than they do. They know 
it," Ross said.
On the London Stock Exchange, miners were weighing on the large cap index with Anglo American, down 2.7%, 
Antofagasta, down 1.0% and Rio Tinto down 1.0%. 
Imperial Brands and Carnival closed down 1.8% and 1.1% respectively after the stocks went ex-dividend meaning 
new buyers no longer qualify for the latest dividend payout. 
In the FTSE 250, TalkTalk Telecom Group ended as the best performer, up 8.4% after Barclays upgraded the home 
phone and broadband provider to Overweight from Equal Weight saying its operating trends are set to improve 
following years of losing market share. 
Elsewhere, Ryanair Holdings closed up 5.5% after the Irish carrier reached an agreement with its Irish pilot union in 
a labour dispute, both sides have announced.
"Following a 22-hour negotiating session, which began on Wednesday morning and concluded Thursday morning, 
agreement has been reached between Forsa and Ryanair in the pilots' dispute," the pilots' trade union Forsa said.
The pilots now have to vote to approve the deal, with the union recommending that they accept it. In the dispute 
over holiday time, transfers and promotions, 100 of Ryanair's 350 Irish-based pilots took part in five days of strike 
action.
Elsewhere, the Saudi government remains committed to an initial public offering of the state oil giant Aramco, but at 
a "time of its own choosing," Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said. His remarks come in response to speculation that 
Saudi authorities called off plans to list the company on the stock exchange, expected to be one of the biggest in 
history. 
The Aramco listing is thought to be part of an ambitious economic reform plan, known as Vision 2030, launched by 
Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the kingdom's oil-reliant economy. 
"The government remains committed to the IPO of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are 
optimal," Aramco chairman Al Falih said in a statement, according to the official Saudi news agency SPA. 
The pound was lower against the dollar quoted at USD1.2830 at the London equities close, compared to 
USD1.2906 at close Wednesday. Sterling hit an intraday high of USD1.2917 in afternoon trade before giving back 
gains. 
In domestic political news, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab reiterated the UK government's conviction that it can and 
will agree a deal with the EU.
Raab told reporters that plans were being made to recruit an extra 9,000 staff into the civil service to deal with 
Brexit, in addition to 7,000 currently working on preparations.
A further 1,000 more Border Force staff are to be recruited, more than triple the additional 300 previously planned 
for. Raab dismissed "misinformation" about what may happen in the event no deal is reached by March, saying his 
stress levels were "fine".
The government published 24 technical papers setting out preparations and scenarios that could play out if a Brexit 
deal cannot be agreed before Britain leaves the EU in March.

The key points from the first set of papers cover several aspects of British life and trade including the removal of an 
EU ban on credit and debit card surcharges. UK citizens living in Europe facing the possibility of losing access to 
their pensions and consumers facing a potential cost increase for shopping online.
"The game of poker between the UK and EU goes on, but it is clear that the UK's journey after a 'no deal' will be 
much harder than the EU's. With this in mind, the pound was a little jittery, but the references to 'progress' in Raab's 
speech helped to calm the currency for a brief period before the US economic strength-related selling resumed," 
said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp.
On the economic front, UK retailers reported an above-average sales growth in the year to August but the outlook 
was less positive with declines in employment, investment intention and business optimism, a closely watched 
survey showed Thursday.
A net balance of 29% said their sales volumes increased in August, according to the latest quarterly Distributive 
Trades Survey from the Confederation of British Industry. However, the balance for the next month fell to 22%.
Further, a net 8% of retailers expected their overall business situation to deteriorate slightly over the next three 
months.
In Paris the CAC 40 ended flat while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended down 0.1%. 
The euro was a touch lower against the dollar at USD1.1569 at the European equities close, against USD1.1599 
late Wednesday. 
In economic news from the continent, the euro area private sector continued to expand in August, albeit with the 
rate of expansion remaining one of the weakest seen over the past 18 months, flash data from IHS Markit showed.
The composite output index rose marginally to 54.4 in August from 54.3 in July. But the score was slightly below the 
forecast of 54.5.
The services Purchasing Managers' Index also came in at 54.4, up from 54.2 a month ago. The score came in line 
with expectations.
Meanwhile, the manufacturing PMI fell unexpectedly to a 21-month low of 54.6 from 55.1 in July. The reading was 
expected to rise slightly to 55.2.
Within the eurozone, growth accelerated in France and Germany but slowed across the rest of the single-currency 
area.
Stocks in New York were lower at the London equities close. The DJIA was down 0.4%, the S&P 500 index down 
0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.1%.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump dodged a question in an interviewed broadcast Thursday about pardoning 
his one-time campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was convicted this week on federal tax and bank fraud 
charges.
Without saying whether he is weighing a pardon, Trump minimized the charges against Manafort, 69, who faces 
decades in prison.
"I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's gone through," Trump told Fox News, a cable channel 
that he frequently praises.

"I would say what he did, some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in 
Washington probably does."
Brent oil was firm quoted at USD74.56 a barrel at the London equities close from USD74.26 at the close 
Wednesday. 
Gold was lower quoted at USD1,189.30 an ounce at the London equities close against USD1,195.95 late 
Wednesday.
The UK corporate calendar on Friday has half year results from IT services provider Computacenter, construction 
and property development company Henry Boot and agriculture and engineering firm Camellia. 
The economic events calendar on Friday has inflation data from Japan at 0030 BST, Germany GDP readings at

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it has reached an agreement with its Irish 
pilots following a series of strikes.
In a statement posted on the airline's Twitter account, Ryanair said it has reached agreement with Irish trade union 
FORSA and its committee of Irish pilots.
The proposals, it continued, will be taken to the Ryanair board once pilots vote on it. Mediator Kieran Mulvey has 
asked both sides not to comment on the matter until the pilot ballot has been carried out. 
Irish pilots went on strike for a fourth time earlier in August. Pilots have been unhappy about the company's plans to 
change seniority rules and its plans for annual leave, transfers, and promotions. 
Ryanair shares were 5.5% higher on Thursday at a price of EUR13.87 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Talks aimed at resolving the long-running dispute between Ryanair Holdings PLC and 
its Irish pilots have got under way.
The budget airline and Forsa, which has been representing the Irish pilots, are attempting to seek a resolution over 
conditions under mediator Kieran Mulvey.
Mulvey, the former head of the Workplace Relations Committee, has set aside three days for the negotiations.
The dispute resulted in a fifth day of strike action on Friday.
About 100 of Ryanair's 350 Irish-based pilots joined colleagues in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden 
in a series of strikes.
The airline said 396 flights were cancelled as a result, disrupting thousands of passengers.
A spokesman for Forsa said Mulvey had asked both parties to refrain from public comment while the process is 
under way.
A Ryanair spokesman said mediation was required after five strikes failed to achieve "anything other than to 
regrettably disrupt some customers".
He added 95% of the airline's flights and the majority of its pilots had operated on those days.
"Mediation should ensure Forsa takes control of their side of the process, take these negotiations more seriously 
and remove unwanted interference," the spokesman said.
"Talks, not strikes, will move this forward and allow Ryanair to make the same progress we are making with other 
unions elsewhere in Europe."
Forsa has not served notice of further strike action while the process of mediation is under way.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Hundreds of Ryanair Holdings PLC flights will not take off as planned on Friday due to 
pilot strikes in five countries.
Staff in Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands are holding a 24-hour walkout over pay and 
conditions.
Around 250 flights have been cancelled as a result, forcing passengers who planned on travelling on Friday to 
rebook or take different routes.
The cancellations constitute about a sixth of Ryanair's 2,400 scheduled flights on Friday, affecting some 55,000 
passengers, dpa reported.
Most of those affected - about 42,000 - will be in Germany, where strike action began at 03:01 am local time and 
comes at the height of the summer holiday season.
The affected passengers have been given the option to reschedule their flights free of charge or get their money 
back. Ryanair will not compensate passengers beyond that.
The only people not to be affected by Ryanair cancellations in Germany are those flying to and from 
Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airport. The pilots stationed there are not participating in the strike, which was called by 
pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit earlier this week.
The Irish budget airline said the strikes were "regrettable and unjustified" and called for unions to come back to the 
negotiating table.
Despite the walkouts, 85% of its scheduled flights, more than 2,000, will operate as normal, Ryanair said.
"Ryanair took every step to minimise the disruption and we notified our customers as early as possible advising 
them of their free move, refund or reroute options," the carrier said.
Pilot Strikes See About 250 Ryanair Flights Cancelled Friday
"The majority of customers have already been accommodated on another Ryanair flight.
"We want to again apologise to customers affected by this unnecessary disruption and we ask the striking unions to 
continue negotiations instead of calling anymore unjustified strikes."

AMSTERDAM (Alliance News) - The biggest industrial action by pilots in Ryanair's history got under way on Friday, 
with nearly 400 flights across Europe cancelled due to the 24-hour stoppage.
The cancellations constitute about a sixth of the Irish budget airline's 2,400 scheduled flights on Friday, affecting 
some 55,000 passengers at the peak of the European holiday season.
Customers in Germany were the hardest hit, with 250 flights cancelled and 42,000 customers affected. Pilots in 
Belgium, Sweden, Ireland, and the Netherlands were also striking.
The affected passengers have been given the option to reschedule their flights free of charge or get their money 
back. Ryanair will not compensate passengers beyond that.
The only people not to be affected by Ryanair cancellations in Germany are those flying to and from 
Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airport. The pilots stationed there are not participating in the strike.
The strike began in Germany at 3.01 am local time and is set to end on Saturday at 2.59 am.
Pilots and crew are seeking new contracts that include better pay and working conditions.
In a statement late Thursday, Ryanair said it had taken "every step to minimize the disruption." It called the strike 
"regrettable and unjustified" and called on unions to continue negotiations.
Ryanair has only recognized pilots unions since last year, taking the step during negotiations to ward off a previous 
threat of strikes.
However last month cabin crews in Portugal, Spain and Belgium went on strike for two days, causing the 
cancellation of 600 flights.

The Japanese economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.9% in the April-to-June quarter, for the first growth in 
two quarters amid a recovery in business spending and private consumption, the government said. The reading

Donald Trump's efforts to cut the chronic US trade deficit.

Senior Zimbabwean opposition politician Tendai Biti was charged with inciting violence and released on bail on 
Thursday, with the country still on edge following a disputed election and violent protests. "Tendai Biti was released 
earlier today following my intervention," said Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who won the 
elections on July 30. "No one is above the law," he added on Twitter. "Thus due to the serious nature of the 
allegations of incitement, due process will continue." Biti was also charged with contravening Zimbabwe's electoral 
law by claiming "unofficial or false results" in the recent election. He was released from a Harare court on bail. 
Authorities in Zambia had deported Biti, a former finance minister and member of the opposition Movement of 
Democratic Change alliance, to Zimbabwe in defiance of a court order, leading to his arrest, his lawyer said.

LONDON BRIEFING: 400 Flights Hit By Biggest Strike Against Ryanair
Nationwide Building Society said the absence of a one-off disposal gain, competitive market conditions and a 
continuing trend of borrowers switching to lower priced products resulted in a year-on-year drop in first quarter 
profit. The unlisted British mutual financial institution also that its full year outlook remains unchanged and that the 
UK economy is expected to grow at a modest pace over the next 12 months. "We are observing consumers 
adapting their behaviours in response to the pressure on disposable income. The housing market looks set to 
remain relatively subdued with house prices broadly flat in 2018. Against this background, we also expect intense 
competition to persist in our core markets," Chief Executive Joe Garner said. Nationwide is the largest building 
society in the UK. It recorded statutory pretax profit of GBP281 million for the three months to June-end, down from 
GBP322 million recorded a year ago, which included an exceptional gain of GBP26 million from disposal of 
payment systems provider VocaLink. Adjusted profit for the first quarter fell year-on-year to GBP270 million from 
GBP301 million, in line with the company's target range.
---------
Volution Group said its annual results are expected in line with board forecasts, with revenue to rise 11% to 
GBP206 million, comprising organic growth of 2.9%. "Organic growth benefited from a stronger performance in our 
UK sector, most notably in Residential New Build," said the ventilation products supplier.
----------
Vitec Group said revenue for the first half of 2018 grew, driving a rise in profit. Revenue for the half rose 11% to 
GBP183.3 million, as pretax profit gained 20% to GBP19.7 million, compared to GBP16.4 million last year. The 
company subsequently bumped up its interim dividend by 11% to 11.5p per share from the 10.4p paid a year 
before. Looking ahead, the broadcast and photographic services provider said its expectations for the full-year are 
unchanged. "We remain on track in the second half of the year; we expect to deliver organic revenue growth and 
year-on-year margin improvements, and to identify businesses to acquire in core and adjacent niche markets," 
Vitec said in a statement.

Sky News, citing sources, reported department store House of Fraser could appoint administrators as soon as 
Friday following days of talks over a rescue deal. On Thursday, Sky News had reported bidders for the troubled

Group Philip Day - were asked to submit "best and final offers" before lunchtime on Thursday. Sports Direct holds 
an 11.1% stake in House of Fraser.

Poundworld UK is set to be acquired by a Dublin retailing family, the Hendersons, in a deal that would salvage part 
of the budget retailer's store estate. David Henderson, whose family opened Ireland's original Poundworld store in 
1984, confirmed an offer had been accepted by administrators Deloitte on Thursday to purchase the best and 
remaining stores for an undisclosed sum. All Poundworld stores will close on Friday as planned but the family will 
begin to reopen some after the deal is rubber-stamped, likely to be next week. Poundworld UK, which was bought 
by private equity firm TPG Capital in 2015 for GBP150 million, collapsed into administration in June, closing over 
250 stores, resulting in the loss of 4,000 jobs.

COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL
----------
News Corp, the publishing company owned by Rupert Murdoch, reported fourth-quarter earnings that trumped Wall 
Street estimates, as revenue surged nearly 30% and surpassed expectations. The New York-based media 
company reported a fourth-quarter loss of USD372 million or USD0.64 per share, compare to last year's loss of 
USD430 million or USD0.74 per share. Adjusted earnings were USD45 million or USD0.08 per share, down from 
USD65 million or USD0.11 per share. Revenue for the quarter rose to 29% to USD2.69 billion from USD2.08 billion 
last year. Analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of USD2.68 billion. Revenue growth reflects the inclusion of 
Foxtel's results, continued strong growth in the Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services segments and a 
USD29 million positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Revenue at key news and information services

segment, which includes Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal, rose 1% from a year ago to USD1.29 billion. 
Among smaller segments, book publishing rose 20%; digital real estate jumped 19%.

Steinhoff International Holdings is facing a more than ZAR185 billion lawsuit from shareholders, Business Day 
reported. On Wednesday, a group of legal firms applied to the High Court in Johannesburg in what the newspaper

increase in EBITDA in 2018. The group noted that this range misses the current market expectations. For the 
second quarter, EBITDA was EUR105.1 million, compared to EUR101.9 million in the previous year. K+S continues 
to pursue the target of a positive free cash flow in 2019, it said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Sports Direct International has acquired 169-year-old British department store chain House of Fraser for GBP90 
million in cash, saving around 17,000 jobs. The sports clothing and equipment retailer will buy the business and 
assets of House of Fraser from administrator Ernst & Young of the company's main operating units - House of 
Fraser Ltd, House of Fraser (Stores) Ltd and James Beattie Ltd. Under the deal, Sports Direct has acquired the 
House of Fraser brand, all of its UK stores and all of the stock in the business. This came after House of Fraser was 
plunged into crisis following C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, pulling its investment into the troubled retail 
chain. C.banner was planning to buy a 51% stake in House of Fraser and plough GBP70 million into the ailing 
retailer, but scrapped the move last week.

Nationwide Building Society said the absence of a one-off disposal gain, competitive market conditions and a 
continuing trend of borrowers switching to lower priced products resulted in a year-on-year drop in first quarter 
profit. The unlisted British mutual financial institution also that its full year outlook remains unchanged and that the

----------
The biggest industrial action by pilots in Ryanair's history got under way on Friday, with nearly 400 flights across 
Europe cancelled due to the 24-hour stoppage. The cancellations constitute about a sixth of the Irish budget 
airline's 2,400 scheduled flights on Friday, affecting some 55,000 passengers at the peak of the European holiday 
season. Pilots and crew are seeking new contracts that include better pay and working conditions. In a statement 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Quarterly UK GDP Gains 1.3% In Line With Forecasts
late Thursday, Ryanair said it had taken "every step to minimize the disruption." It called the strike "regrettable and 
unjustified" and called on unions to continue negotiations. Ryanair has only recognized pilots unions since last year, 
taking the step during negotiations to ward off a previous threat of strikes.
----------
News Corp, the publishing company owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, reported that its fourth quarter 
earnings trumped Wall Street estimates, as revenue surged nearly 30% and surpassed expectations. The New 
York-based media company reported a fourth-quarter loss of USD372 million or USD0.64 per share, compare to 
last year's loss of USD430 million or USD0.74 per share. Adjusted earnings were USD45 million or USD0.08 per 
share, down from USD65 million or USD0.11 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of 
USD0.06 per share. Revenue for the quarter rose to 29% to USD2.69 billion from USD2.08 billion last year. 
Analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of USD2.68 billion.

MARKETS
----------
Stocks in London were lower with Evraz the worst performer in the FTSE 100, while the pound traded around its 
worst levels since August last year despite the latest UK GDP reading coming in in line with expectations. Ahead, 
focus is on the US consumer price index at 1330 BST. Before the data, Wall Street was pointed to a lower open 
with the Dow Jones called down 0.4%.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK economic growth doubled in the second quarter driven by stronger growth in both services and construction 
sectors, first quarterly estimate from the Office for National Statistics showed. Gross domestic product rose 0.4%, 
faster than the 0.2% expansion seen in the first quarter. The rate came in line with expectations. The dominant 
services output expanded 0.5%, and construction logged a quarterly growth of 0.9%. However, production dropped 
0.8%. On a yearly basis, UK GDP advanced 1.3% versus 1.2% growth seen a quarter ago.
----------
The Japanese economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.9% in the April-to-June quarter, for the first growth in 
two quarters amid a recovery in business spending and private consumption, the government said Friday. The 
reading beat the 1.3% growth forecast by analysts polled by the Nikkei business daily and followed a 0.6% 
contraction in the previous three months. Moderate growth was seen in corporate investment in the April-to-June 
period, which rose 1.3%, following a 0.5% increase in the previous quarter. GDP private consumption was up 0.7% 
on quarter, topping forecasts for 0.2% after easing 0.1% in the three months prior.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks fell sharply on Friday as a banking crisis in 
Turkey coupled with lingering worries over a trade war between the world's two biggest economies dent demand for 
riskier assets.
The Turkish lira tumbled more than 14% in early trade to hit a new low amid a deepening rift with the US and 
intensifying worries about the state of the economy.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.9% at 386.37 in late opening deals after closing up 0.1% 
on Thursday.
The German DAX was down as much as 1.7%, France's CAC 40 index was losing 1.3% and the UK's FTSE 100 
was declining 0.7%.
Spanish lender BBVA slumped 4.2% and Italy's UniCredit tumbled 3.4% on worries about the contagion effects of a 
dramatic fall in the Turkish lira.
Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas lost 2-4% after the European Bank reportedly expressed 
concerns over the impact of a weak Turkish lira on European banks.
Miners Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore were down about 2% while energy firms BP PLC, Tullow Oil and 
Total SA fell between 0.7% and 1.5%.
Biotechnology firm Novozymes declined 2.8% after its second-quarter results came in below expectations.
Budget carrier Ryanair Holdings declined 1.8% after grounding 400 flights amid a coordinated 24-hour workers 
strike.
Diageo was little changed after announcing it would start buying back up to 1.4 billion pounds ($1.79 billion) of its 
shares until Jan. 31.
European Shares Tumble As Lira Crisis Spreads
In economic releases, UK economic growth doubled in the second quarter driven by stronger growth in both 
services and construction sectors, first quarterly estimate from the Office for National Statistics showed.
Gross domestic product rose 0.4%, matching expectations and faster than the 0.2% expansion seen in the first 
quarter.
UK industrial production also expanded in June after falling for three straight months. Output climbed 0.4% month-
on-month, reversing a 0.2% fall in May. This marked the first increase in four months.
France's industrial and manufacturing output rebounded in June, driven by a recovery in petroleum output.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets ended Friday's session firmly in the red. 
Concerns over global trade and the banking crisis in Turkey weighed on sentiment at the end of the trading week.
The Turkish Lira nose-dived against the US dollar in the European session on Friday, plunging to an all-time low, 
following a news report that the European Central Bank has raised concerns over the impact of a weak lira on 
European banks.
The ECB is more concerned about the exposure of some banks in France, Italy and Spain to Turkey's problems, 
according to a report in the Financial Times.
Those banks are particularly BBVA of Spain, Italy's UniCredit and BNP Paribas of France.
The currency has been falling amid widening rift between the US and Turkey and intensifying worries about the 
state of the economy.
Diplomatic talks between Washington and Ankara in Washington to resolve issues appeared to break down this 
week. Both the nations were at logger-heads over the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson in Turkey on 
terrorism charges, as well as US sanctions on Turkish ministers.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday played down concerns over the falling currency, calling citizens to 
"ignore campaigns against Turkey."
"Don't forget, if they have their dollars, we have our people, our God. We are working hard. Look at what we were 
16 years ago and look at us now," he told supporters in the Black Sea province of Rize.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 1.1%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 2.0%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 1.2%.
European Markets Sank Due To Banking Crisis In Turkey
The DAX of Germany dropped 2.0% and the CAC of France fell 1.6%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 1.0% and 
the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 1.3%.
In Frankfurt, energy group Innogy dropped 0.5% after reporting a 10% fall in first-half operating profit.
In London, budget carrier Ryanair Holdings declined 3.7% after grounding 400 flights amid a coordinated 24-hour 
workers strike.
Diageo finished marginally lower after announcing it would start buying back up to GBP1.4 billion (USD1.79 billion) 
of its shares until Jan 31.
Biotechnology firm Novozymes declined 3.3% in Copenhagen after its second-quarter results came in below 
expectations.
France's industrial and manufacturing output rebounded in June driven by a recovery in petroleum output, data from 
the statistical office Insee showed Friday. Industrial output climbed 0.6% month-on-month in June, reversing a 0.2% 
fall in May. Production was expected to gain 0.5%.
UK economic growth doubled in the second quarter driven by stronger growth in both services and construction 
sectors, first quarterly estimate from the Office for National Statistics showed Friday. Gross domestic product rose 
0.4%, faster than the 0.2% expansion seen in the first quarter. The rate came in line with expectations.
UK industrial production expanded in June after falling for three straight months, data from the Office for National 
Statistics showed Friday. Industrial production climbed 0.4% month-on-month, reversing a 0.2% fall in May. This 
was the first increase in four months. Output was expected to climb 0.3%.
The UK's visible trade deficit narrowed in June, while the surplus in services grew, leading to a smaller total trade 
gap, data from the Office for National Statistics showed Friday. The visible trade deficit decreased to GBP11.38 
billion from GBP12.52 billion in May. Economists had forecast a shortfall of GBP11.90 billion.
Consumer prices in the US showed a modest increase in the month of July, according to a report released by the 
Labor Department on Friday. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.2% in July after 
inching up by 0.1% in June. The increase in prices matched economist estimates.

LONDON BRIEFING: TUI , Ryanair Shares Down Amid Mixed Travel Industry

LONDON (Alliance News) - There was decidedly mixed news for the travel industry on Thursday, as holiday 
operator TUI Group reported lower profit but retained a confident outlook, while budget airline Ryanair continued to 
struggle with strikes and received a broker downgrade.
TUI reiterated its annual earnings guidance as it posted a 27% drop in third-quarter pretax profit.
The Anglo-German travel operator also said that summer bookings for the current year are up 4%, with 86% of the 
programme sold, in line with prior year.
For the three months to June-end, TUI recorded pretax profit of EUR147.5 million, down from EUR203.3 million 
recorded in the comparative year ago period, on a revenue of EUR5.02 billion and EUR4.78 billion, respectively.
The drop in quarterly pretax profit was blamed upon a decline in financial income and increased cost of sales. The 
rise in revenue was credited to 5% growth in customer volumes, good portfolio performance, and additional hotel 
and cruise ship capacity.
Adjusted earnings before income, taxes and amortisation - the company's preferred profit measure - fell 18% to 
EUR193.4 million in the quarter from EUR235.8 million a year ago.
For the 2018 financial year, ending in September, TUI said it expects to record at least 10% underlying Ebita growth 
over the year earlier, with revenue growth of around 3%. In the 2017 financial year, TUI posted underlying Ebita of 
EUR1.10 billion and revenue of EUR18.54 billion.
The stock was down 4.7% early Thursday in London, the worst FTSE 100 performer.
LONDON BRIEFING: TUI , Ryanair Shares Down Amid Mixed Travel Industry
Meanwhile, Ryanair has cancelled 250 flights scheduled for Friday in response to an announcement from the 
German pilots' union that its members would join a strike by Ryanair pilots in Sweden, Ireland and Belgium.
The move comes on top of 146 other cancellations announced several days ago due to the coinciding pilot strikes 
in three other countries, taking the total number of cancellations to nearly 400. It will be the biggest strike in the 
airline's history.
Raymond James downgraded the stock to Market Perform from Outperform. Ryanair shares were down 1.3% early 
Thursday in London.

The US announced fresh sanctions on Moscow, citing Russia's responsibility for an assassination attempt on a 
former double agent, Sergei Skripal and his daughter in an English city earlier this year with a nerve agent. The 
sanctions, which will likely come into effect on August 22, would affect a range of security and defence goods. 
Certain exceptions would be made for commercial aviation and space flight materials. The State Department said 
the US had determined Russia had used weapons banned under a chemical and biological weapons act, a law 
which mandates the imposition of sanctions. The law has been used twice before, on Syria and North Korea. Britain 
has long blamed Russia for the attack, though Moscow denies involvement. The US had previously expelled 
Russian diplomats in a sign of solidarity with Britain.

USD87.3 million a year prior, as costs rose. Revenue for the three months to June increased to USD283.7 million 
from USD273.3 million, with gold sales rising 5% quarter-on-quarter to USD411.5 million. Cash costs were 4% 
higher on the first quarter and 15% higher year-on-year due to higher throughput at several mines, while total cash 
costs per ounce of gold rose 21% year-on-year. Randgold's gold output for the quarter was 313,302 ounces, 9%

work stoppages, negotiations over the Democratic Republic of the Congo's new mining code, as well as a 
permitting delay.
----------
Russian miner and steel maker Evraz reported "strong" cash flow for the six months to June, rising to USD661 
million from USD549 million. Revenue increased 24% to USD6.34 million for the period, while pretax profit soared 
to USD1.54 billion from USD294 million due to both the increase in revenue and a foreign exchange gain. Earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation increased 66% year-on-year to USD1.15 billion, with the Ebitda 
margin climbing to 30% from 23% on the back of higher vanadium, steel, and coal prices as well as lower costs. 
Total debt has fallen by some USD646 million to USD4.79 billion, while cost savings of USD117 million were made 
in the period due to productivity improvements and cost-cutting, the company said. Evraz is paying a 40 US cent 
interim dividend, compared to 30 cents a year prior, when it restored its interim payout.

COMPANIES - FTSE 250
----------
Cineworld's revenue for the first half rose to USD1.86 billion from USD528.7 million, with the results including its 
Regal Entertainment acquisition in February. Pretax profit for the six months to June more than doubled to 
USD160.2 million from USD60.5 million, while adjusted pretax profit has likewise soared to USD152.4 million from 
USD54 million. Admissions for the period rose 4.9% on a pro forma basis, with pro forma revenue up 11% to 
USD2.46 billion and adjusted Ebitda up 14% pro forma to USD553.8 million. Cineworld is paying an interim 
dividend of 4.85 US cents per share, compared to 6p a year prior - the company has switched to reporting in dollars 
following the Regal takeover.
----------
Brickmaker Ibstock confirmed it is paying a special dividend alongside its normal interim payout, following a strong 
six months to June of cash generation and a positive market. Ibstock is paying a supplementary dividend of 6.5p for 
the period, alongside an interim dividend of 3.0p compared to 2.6p a year prior. The company had said at the time 
of its 2017 results in 2017 it was mulling extra shareholder returns and that it would be similar to the final dividend 
of that year, which was 6.5p. Revenue nudged up 0.7% to GBP229.9 million, while pretax profit was up 31% to 
GBP50.9 million but adjusted Ebitda fell 2.2% to GBP58.4 million due to previously cited bad weather and higher 
energy costs. Ibstock said brick demand in the UK was strong in the half, but maintenance spending in brick making 
assets will hit short-term financial performance. However, the market remains strong, it said, and it is well placed for 
a good second half.
----------
Estate agent Savills reported 2% revenue growth for the six months to June, rising 5% at constant currency, to 
GBP727.8 million. However, underlying pretax profit fell 12%, and 10% constant currency, to GBP42.4 million, with 
the reported figure falling 18% to GBP26.7 million. Savills is paying an interim dividend of 4.8p per share, from the 
4.65p it paid a year before. The company said full-year expectations remain unchanged, and that is has been 
"resilient" in the face of difficult market conditions with a good pipeline for the second half of the year.

Property firm Derwent London increased its net rental income for the six months to June to GBP80.6 million, a 1.6% 
rise. Derwent London's net asset value fell 0.1% after dividends to 3,713p from December's figure, while it has 
raised its interim dividend 10% to 19.10p. New lettings rose 8.2% on December to GBP8.4 million, and Derwent 
London's portfolio value has risen 1.3% to GBP5.0 billion. Derwent London is confident in can grow earnings over 
the medium term with London's occupier demand "robust".

Card Factory reported total first half sales growth, for the six months to July 31, of 3.2%, but like-for-like sales fell 
0.2% due to the weak consumer environment and "extreme" weather. This like-for-like sales growth compares to 
the 3.1% recorded in the same period a year prior. In its Getting Personal business, sales fell 8.5% year-on-year. 
The first half a year ago had reported 5% sales growth on the year before that. Due to weather, and the uncertain

UK consumer environment, Card Factory expects underlying Ebitda for its year ending January to be between 
GBP89 million and GBP91 million, with the figure in its last financial year GBP94.0 million. However, it does expect 
a return of surplus cash towards the end of its year of between 5p and 10p a share.

AA said it is on track to deliver its Ebitda guidance despite poor weather in the six months to July. Paid 
memberships have fallen 1% to 3.3 million, as expected, as AA's retention rate decreased, hit by higher 
competitiveness and regulation. AA's Insurance business has done well, with motor policies rising 7% year-on-year, 
while cash generation is strong, it said.

The US Securities & Exchange Commission has inquired with Tesla regarding CEO Elon Musk's announcement 
that he might take the company private, according to a newspaper report. The Wall Street Journal said the SEC has 
asked whether Musk's announcement on Tuesday was factual. The regulator also asked Tesla why the disclosure 
was made on Twitter rather than in a regulatory filing. On Tuesday, Musk tweeted that he is "considering" to take 
the luxury electric car maker private at about USD70 billion. Musk, who has often complained about constraints of a 
public company because investors and analysts focus more on quarterly results than on long-term goals, said he 
already has secured the funding. "Am considering taking Tesla private at USD420. Funding secured," Musk 
tweeted.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
TUI reiterated its annual earnings guidance as it posted a 27% drop in third-quarter pretax profit. The Anglo-
German travel operator also said that summer bookings for the current year are up 4%, with 86% of the programme 
sold, in line with a year prior. For the three months to June-end, TUI recorded pretax profit of EUR147.5 million, 
down from EUR203.3 million recorded in the comparative year ago period, on a revenue of EUR5.02 billion and 
EUR4.78 billion, respectively. The drop in quarterly pretax profit was blamed upon a decline in financial income and 
increased cost of sales. The rise in revenue was credited to 5% growth in customer volumes, good portfolio 
performance, and additional hotel and cruise ship capacity.
----------
Legal & General Group reported a drop in interim profit but upped its dividend. The FTSE 100-listed life insurance 
and financial services company said pretax profit decreased 19% to GBP942 million over the first half of the year 
from GBP1.16 billion a year before, due to "lower positive investment variance" as a result of volatility in global 
financial markets to GBP33 million from GBP175 million the year before. This includes a GBP90 million loss from a 
GBP52 million gain from the company's Legal & General Capital traded assets portfolio. The company is proposing 
an interim dividend of 4.60 pence per share, a 7.0% increase from the 4.30p paid last year.
----------
G4S reported a large drop in interim profit and revenue due to currency movements and business disposals. The 
security services company's statutory pretax profit decreased 37% in the six months ended June to GBP139 million 
from GBP219 million the year before. Revenue decreased 7.5% to GBP3.67 billion from GBP3.97 billion. Currency 
movements contributed a GBP10 million loss to profit and a GBP173 million loss to revenue year-on-year. 
Excluding the effects of currency movements, profit fell due to weaker trading in the company's Europe & Middle 
East Secure Solutions division as well as lower revenue and increased business costs in its Cash Solutions 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Card Factory Sales Hit By "Extreme" UK Weather
division. G4S's revenue also suffered from business disposals in Hungary, Israel and its Youth Services business in 
the US.
----------
Ryanair Holdings is seeking a temporary injunction in the Netherlands to block a strike scheduled to start on Friday. 
A Haarlem court will rule Thursday on whether the national pilot union may go ahead with the strike, which is set to 
last one day. Pilots and crew are seeking a new contract on wages that includes better working conditions. The 
union announced Wednesday that its members would join their counterparts in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and 
Sweden in the strike. It is scheduled to take place between 3:01 am local time Friday and 2:59 am Saturday.
----------
Card Factory said its interim results showed a strong performance in seasonal ranges but a decline in non-seasonal 
sales, as "extreme weather" dented UK high-street footfall. For the first half to July 31, total group sales grew by 
3.2% compared to a 6.1% growth a year before. Like-for-like sales were down by 0.2% compared to 3.1% growth in 
the first half of the year before. However, non-seasonal like-for-like sales fell by 0.7% in the first half compared to a 
rise of 3.0% a year before. The company said: "Due to the weather impact and continuing uncertainty around the 
UK consumer environment, the board expects underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization for the year ending January 2019 to be within the range of GBP89 million to GBP91 million". 
----------
MARKETS
----------
The FTSE 100 was lower on Thursday amid a raft of ex-dividend stocks weighing on the blue-chip index, including 
BT Group which was down 4.2%, Direct Line Insurance Group down 2.9% and Diageo down 1.9%. Wall Street is 
seen opening marginally higher, with earnings from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp due after markets in the US 
close.

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
China's consumer inflation accelerated on higher food and non-food prices, but remained well within the 
government's target and producer price inflation slowed in July, giving space for monetary policy adjustment. 
Consumer price inflation rose to 2.1% in July from 1.9% in June, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed 
Thursday. A similar higher rate was last seen in March. The rate was forecast to rise marginally to 2.1%. 
Nonetheless, inflation remains well below the government's target of around 3%. Core inflation excluding volatile 
food and energy prices held steady at 1.9% in July. Meanwhile, producer price inflation eased slightly to 4.6% from 
4.7% in June, another report from NBS showed. The annual increase was slower than the expected 4.5%.
----------
Rent prices are predicted to rocket 15% in the UK over the next five years as the supply of new property onto the 
market continues to dry up while demand increases. A survey carried out by the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors showed 22% more respondents reporting a fall in new landlord instructions in the last three months. It is 
the eighth consecutive quarter the number of rental properties has fallen, RICS added. A dearth of properties 
means that expectations for rental growth are on the rise, with rents projected to increase by a little short of 2% 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Card Factory Sales Hit By "Extreme" UK Weather
nationally over the next 12 months. However, RICS said the longer-term outlook will see a mammoth 15% added to 
rents by 2023.
----------
A no-deal Brexit would be a "nightmare scenario" for the insurance industry and must be avoided "at all costs" to 
safeguard the future of the sector, a new report has warned. The report by global law firm Kennedys said that slow 
progress in Brexit negotiations has forced many insurance companies to draw up - and in some cases implement - 
plans to move part of their business out of the UK, with Dublin a favoured destination. Interviews with senior 
industry figures revealed a "gulf" between their preferred Brexit outcome and Theresa May's Chequers plan, with 
"serious concerns" over the Prime Minister's decision to ditch UK demands for mutual recognition of British and EU 
regulations in the service sector.
----------
The US announced fresh sanctions on Moscow Wednesday, citing Russia's responsibility for an assassination 
attempt on a former double agent, Sergei Skripal and his daughter in an English city earlier this year with a nerve 
agent. The sanctions, which will likely come into effect on August 22, would affect a range of security and defence 
goods. Certain exceptions would be made for commercial aviation and space flight materials. The State Department 
said the US had determined Russia had used weapons banned under a chemical and biological weapons act, a law 
which mandates the imposition of sanctions.A Downing Street spokesman welcomed the move saying the "strong 
international response to the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury sends an unequivocal message 
to Russia that its provocative, reckless behaviour will not go unchallenged".
----------
North and South Korea plan to hold high-level talks next week to prepare for a possible third meeting between their 
leaders, the Unification Ministry in Seoul said on Wednesday. The talks are also aimed at implementing previous 
agreements, the ministry said. Kim Jong Un of North Korea and Moon Jae In of South Korea met for the first time in 
April and agreed on steps towards nuclear disarmament. They met again in May for a second time. The next 
meeting is expected to take place on the northern side of the border in the so-called truce village of Panmunjom in 
the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.

FRANKFURT (Alliance News) - German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit  is preparing to announce strike action, 
with a spokesman saying on Tuesday that a midnight deadline passed without the union receiving an improved 
offer for pay and conditions from budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC.
The spokesman said a strike plan would be announced at 11 am local time on Wednesday. The stoppage is 
expected to include all 400 German Ryanair pilots, who could walk out at 24 hours' notice.
Last week, 96% of the VC union's members voted in favour of industrial action.
The deadline comes three days after Irish Ryanair pilots held a 24-hour strike. It also comes ahead of a strike on 
Friday organized by pilots unions in Sweden, Belgium and Ireland that has prompted Ryanair to cancel 146 of its 
2,400 planned flights that day.
The airline said last week that it had issued notices of possible redundancy to 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew after 
its board approved a plan to cut its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair urged an Irish pilots' union to agree to mediation of a long-
running dispute, as the pilots held their fourth 24-hour strike on Friday.
The airline said the strike had "no effect" on passengers since it had cancelled 24 of Friday's 300 Ryanair flights to 
and from Ireland more than a week ago.
It accused the Irish public sector trade union Forsa, which represents the pilots, of refusing to "engage or explain" 
its position on two outstanding issues, saying the two sides had broadly agreed on other points.
"Given the non-engagement by Forsa ... [and] that unsuccessful strikes keep repeating, Ryanair now feels the only 
way to introduce common sense is by way of third-party mediation," said Eddie Wilson, the airline's chief personnel 
officer.
Wilson proposed Kieran Mulvey, a former government labour official, for the role of mediator.
Forsa, which has announced a fifth strike for August 10, said Ryanair's mediation offer was an "unexpected and 
positive development."
It said the union would "consult with its members in the company, and looks forward to talking to Kieran Mulvey 
about when a process could begin."
The pilots are unhappy about Ryanair's plans to change seniority rules and its procedures for annual leave, 
transfers and promotions.
The union accused Ryanair of attempted "union busting" last month after it warned that it could cut 100 pilots and 
200 cabin crew from its staff in Ireland as it reduces its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in International Consolidated Airlines Group fell on Friday after interim profit fell 
short of analysts expectations - despite jumping 24%. 
Shares in the airline group, which unites airlines Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, were trading 2.8% 
lower at 665.60 pence each, making them the worst performers in the FTSE 100 index.
"Sometimes profits rising by the best part of 20% just isn't enough. Unfortunately for IAG, this is one of those times. 
Simply put, expectations were higher," said George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
For the six months ended June 30, IAG posted pretax profit of EUR1.65 billion, up from the EUR758 million 
reported in the comparative period a year ago.
A reduction in net non-operating costs, which dropped 30% to EUR80 million, and engineering and aircraft costs, 
down 11% to EUR822 million, helped the profit increase.
Total revenue increased by 3.1% to EUR11.20 billion from EUR10.86 billion, with passenger revenue up 3.6% to 
EUR9.93 billion, cargo up 3.5% to EUR557 million and other revenue down 3.7% to EUR711 million.
For the second quarter of the year, IAG's total revenue increased 4.0% to EUR6.18 billion from EUR5.94 billion, 
while profit climbed 6.3% to EUR770 million from EUR684 million year-on-year.
In the half-year, the company's operating profit increased 17% to EUR1.73 billion from EUR873 million. British 
Airways and Iberia both generated operating profit up 17%. Aer Lingus profit was up a whopping 96%.
Spanish discount carrier Vueling however, widened its loss to EUR11 million from EUR7 million a year ago, mainly 
due to a EUR20 million blow from air traffic control strikes in the second quarter.
Vueling was forced to cancel more than 900 flight in the month of June, impacting around 150,000 passengers, the 
Press Association reported in July. 
IN DEPTH: IAG Interim Profit Jumps 24% But Fails Analysts Expectations
"Unfortunately, French air traffic control strikes continued to challenge our airlines' operations causing disruption to 
our customers. Vueling was particularly affected and incurred an additional EUR20 million of disruption costs in the 
quarter," IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said.
He added: "These strikes are also having a significant negative impact on the Spanish economy and tourism."
At the end of July, Walsh said that France's air traffic control strikes risk damaging passenger confidence and 
bookings if they do not end soon.
IAG has joined forces with rivals easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC to complain to the 
European Commission about the strikes.
"This is an example of where fierce rivals come together on a matter of common concern and the interests of our 
industry," Walsh told the Press Association when the complaint was filed last month.
Walsh said he was "optimistic" that the complaint will lead to change, but added that the airlines are prepared to 
pursue legal action if the issue was not resolved.
They claim that France's strikes are breaching the principle of freedom of movement within the EU as they are 
denying passengers the right to travel between member states.
During the second quarter, the airline reduced non-fuel costs by 4.5%. However, fuel costs increased 6.7% as a 
result of currency movements.
"Fuel prices rose significantly in the six-month period, partially offset by a weaker US dollar against both the euro 
and the pound sterling," IAG explained.
With IAG "at the mercy of the ups and downs of the oil price", Salmon believes that the company's focus should be 
on its cost base, and especially on its non-fuel operating costs. 
"These are the ones IAG can control. There's some good news on this front, with costs falling at a faster rate than 
we've seen recently," he added.
In June, IAG, expanded its low-cost operations by launching a new short-haul Austrian subsidiary called LEVEL, 
which started flying from Vienna in July. 
Earlier in the year, IAG's effort to expand in the low-cost long-haul market by acquiring Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA 
were crushed after the Nordic airline rejected two takeover offers. 
In May, Norwegian said it received two separate conditional proposals from IAG, which were unanimously rejected. 
"IAG has its eyes set on the expanding market for low-cost long-haul. That means another approach for Norwegian 
Air can't be ruled out," Salmon said.
He added: "There's clear upside to combining the two groups, but as ever, whether it's a good idea or not will 
depend on price. IAG has been rebuffed twice before, so it's unlikely to get Norwegian on the cheap."
For all of 2018, the company expects, at current fuel prices and exchange rates, its operating profit to "show an 
increase" compared to 2017.
"Both passenger unit revenue and non-fuel unit costs are expected to improve at constant currency," IAG added.
In a separate release, the airline group posted figures for its July performance, showing a 7.5% increase year-on-
year in group traffic.
In July, traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, increased to 26.60 billion from 24.74 billion the same 
month in 2017.
IN DEPTH: IAG Interim Profit Jumps 24% But Fails Analysts Expectations
The highest traffic improvement was reported in North America, up 12%, with Domestic - including routes within the 
UK, Spain, Ireland and Italy - runner up at 10%.
Latin America & Caribbean traffic was up 7.5% while Europe, Africa & Middle East, and Asia Pacific followed up 
6.4%, 2.1% and 1.8% respectively.
Taking into consideration the year-to-date, traffic was up 7% year-on-year at 153.97 billion.
In July the company's airlines carried 11.5 million passengers, 6.9% more year-on-year from 10.7 million while the 
total number of passengers in the half-year increased 8% to 52 million.
By airline, the best July performer was Iberia, which grew traffic 10% on last year. Aer Lingus closely followed at 
9.5%. British Airways' traffic grew 6.4% with Vueling traffic up 5.3%.
However, if considering performance for the year to-date, Vueling was second best up 11% versus Iberia's 12%. 
IAG's group load factor increased by 1.6 percentage points to 88% from 86.4% in the comparative month a year 
ago.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday reported a 4% growth in passenger traffic in July, 
despite being forced to cancel over 1,000 flights. 
During the past month, the Irish budget airline grew traffic by 4% to 13.1 million passengers from 12.6 million a year 
ago.
Load factor remained unchanged at 97% on the back of lower fares, the airline added.
In July, Ryanair said it cancelled over 1,000 flights, affecting almost 200,000 passengers, due to air traffic control 
staff shortages, adverse weather and "unnecessary" pilot and cabin crew strikes.
"Ryanair, together with other European airlines, calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European 
governments to address the effect of these ATC staff shortages which are disrupting the travel plans of millions of 
Europe's consumers this summer," the company said.
Last week, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, easyJet PLC, Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings PLC issued 
a joint statement to complain to the European Commission against France's industrial action.
Meanwhile, according to the airline's annual report, issued on Monday, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary decided to 
voluntarily renounce to his bonus for financial 2018 following the cancellation of flights in September last year due 
to scheduling errors.
O'Leary was paid a base salary of EUR1.1 million in respect of the past financial year and was entitled to a bonus 
of up to the same amount again.
He decided however to voluntarily give up the hefty bonus in light of the the pilot rostering failure, which led to the 
cancellation of 2,000 flights.
Ryanair Traffic Grows 4% In July Despite Over 1,000 Cancellations
For the year to March 31, Ryanair reported revenue of EUR7.2 billion, up from EUR6.5 billion the prior year. Pretax 
profit grew to EUR1.6 billion from EUR1.4 billion.
In its most recent results, for the first quarter of financial 2019 to June 30, Ryanair reported profit down 20% year-
on-year to EUR319 million from EUR397 million, on a revenue of EUR2.08 billion and EUR1.91 billion, respectively. 
Ryanair shares were trading down 2.5% at EUR13.13 on Thursday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - German pilots at budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC have voted to strike unless a 
dispute over pay is resolved in the coming days.
The Vereinigung Cockpit union said 96% of the pilots who voted supported the stoppage.
It accused the airline of "playing for time" in talks since January on a collective pay agreement.
The union said it is "offering Ryanair a final deadline to submit a workable proposal by August 6 2018".
Europe's second-biggest airline by passenger numbers has seen staff in Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Belgium strike 
over pay in recent months.
Ryanair said it has invited union representatives to meet next week.
A strike next week would coincide with the end of summer holidays in parts of Germany.

IAG CEO Optimistic Over Legal Bid To End Air Traffic Strike Misery

LONDON (Alliance News) - The boss of British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA has 
said he is "optimistic" over a legal challenge to end crippling strikes, but warned over long-term disruptions for fliers 
if it does not succeed.
IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh told the Press Association that France's air traffic control strikes risk damaging 
passenger confidence and bookings if they do not end soon.
He said last week's co-ordinated action by IAG, easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC to 
complain to the European Commission against France's industrial action showed the level of concern among 
carriers.
"This is an example of where fierce rivals come together on a matter of common concern and the interests of our 
industry," he said.
"When you get the likes of IAG, Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air coming together saying the same thing and arguing 
for the same thing, people do take notice."
He added he was "optimistic" the complaint will effect change, and said "the fact we are prepared to make a formal 
complaint and pursue legal channels demonstrates the concern".
The four airlines claim France's strikes breach the "fundamental principle of freedom of movement within the EU", 
having already caused tens of thousands of flights to be cancelled this year, impacting millions of passengers.
They allege that France is breaking EU law by not enabling flights over the country during strikes, denying 
passengers their fundamental freedom to travel between member states not affected by strike action.
The air traffic control strikes are costly for airlines and hugely disruptive for passengers, especially in France, as 
many UK flights need to use the country's air space or fly longer routes to avoid it.
IAG CEO Optimistic Over Legal Bid To End Air Traffic Strike Misery
Mr Walsh said the industrial action has been particularly disruptive for IAG's Spanish low-cost airline Vueling, which 
was forced to cancel more than 900 flights in June as a result of the strikes, impacting around 150,000 passengers.
BA has been impacted to a lesser extent, with 45 flights cancelled as a result in June, but the cost to IAG will be 
revealed in its half-year results on Friday.
"It's impacted on business people, families travelling on holidays and people who have had the need to travel for 
urgent requirements, so it's hugely disruptive and could be avoided," said Mr Walsh.
Ryanair and easyJet have also laid bare the impact of the strikes in recent weeks, with around 2,000 flights 
cancelled between them both in June alone as a result of the action.
Luton-based easyJet revealed in July it had taken a GBP25 million hit from the disruption as it was forced to pay 
passengers compensation.
French ATC strikes have increased by 300% so far this year.
More than 16,000 flights were delayed in the first half of 2018 alone due to ATC strikes, affecting more than two 
million passengers, according to Eurocontrol figures.
Mr Walsh said there has been some respite in July, with France suspending its ATC strikes, but warned it will only 
be brief.
"This year has been a very bad year for ATC strike delays, but if we don't do something about it, it's only going to 
get worse," he said.
"This problem will reoccur."
The airlines want the Commission to insist France allows overflights during its strikes so that the disruption is not 
more widespread.
They believe there is legal precedent to this case, dating back to 1997, when the Spanish complained to the 
European Commission after French farmers prevented their fruit and vegetable exports into the EU.
The European Court ruled against France as the French authorities did not address the farmers' actions and failed 
to ensure the free movement of goods.
Mr Walsh admitted the legal avenue they have pursued is "not a quick process", but should prevent future 
disruption on such a devastating scale.
"It's important that we lodge this case and see action being taken," he said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday refused to compensate passengers 
whose flights were cancelled due to strikes by Ryanair staff this week, because it deems the action "unreasonable".
The airline cancelled 600 flights scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday due to a strike by cabin crew in Belgium, 
Spain and Portugal, affecting some 50,000 passengers.
Under EU legislation for flight cancellations, an airline should pay EUR250 to each passenger, subject to conditions.
"Ryanair fully complies with all EU...legislation. However, as these flight cancellations were caused by extraordinary 
circumstances, no compensation is due," the airline said.
It argued that no compensation is payable "when the union is acting unreasonably and totally beyond the airline's 
control".
Ryanair faces another one-day strike next week by Irish-based pilots, as a European pilots' union on Thursday 
accused it of attempted "union busting" by warning that it could cut up to 300 staff in Ireland this winter.
The airline said it issued notices of possible redundancy to 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew after its board approved a 
plan to cut its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.
"This unfortunate and entirely avoidable decision by Ryanair can be interpreted at best as a very immature 
response to legitimate strike action," said Dirk Polloczek, president of the European Cockpit Association.
"At worst as a bold attempt at union busting and an effort to put maximum pressure on pilots to stop industrial 
action," Polloczek added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair on Thursday refused to compensate passengers whose flights 
were cancelled due to strikes by Ryanair staff this week because it deems the action "unreasonable."
The airline cancelled 600 flights scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday due to a strike by cabin crew in Belgium, 
Spain and Portugal, affecting some 50,000 passengers.
Under EU legislation for flight cancellations, an airline should pay EUR250 to each passenger, unless they are 
informed at least two weeks in advance or are offered alternative flights arriving at their destination the same day.
An airline can withhold compensation if it can show that the cancellation is "caused by extraordinary circumstances 
which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken," according to the rules.
"Ryanair fully complies with all EU...legislation. However, as these flight cancellations were caused by extraordinary 
circumstances, no compensation is due," the airline said.
It argued that no compensation is payable "when the union is acting unreasonably and totally beyond the airline's 
control."
Ryanair faces another one-day strike next week by Irish-based pilots, as a European pilots' union on Thursday 
accused it of attempted "union busting" by warning that it could cut up to 300 staff in Ireland this winter.
On Thursday, the airline cancelled 20 of its 300 scheduled flights to and from Ireland on August 3, saying the Irish 
pilots' union had rejected its offer to hold talks.
The airline said it issued notices of possible redundancy to 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew after its board approved a 
plan to cut its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.
"This unfortunate and entirely avoidable decision by Ryanair can be interpreted at best as a very immature

"At worst as a bold attempt at union busting and an effort to put maximum pressure on pilots to stop industrial 
action," Polloczek added.
Philip von Schoeppenthau, the ECA's secretary general, said the airline's "provocation and unnecessary behaviour 
will only encourage even more pilots to leave Ryanair for competitor airlines."
"The myth of union-friendly Ryanair is falling apart," von Schoeppenthau said, accusing the airline of "reverting to its 
previous anti-union tactics, while claiming publicly to constructively engage with its unions."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish discount airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday it will cut six planes from 
its Dublin-based fleet for the winter 2018 season, leading to potential 300 jobs losses.
The company will cut the fleet by 20% to 24 from 30, as it claimed Irish pilot strikes resulted in a downturn in 
forward bookings as consumers lost confidence in the airline's reliability.
The growth in Ryanair's Polish chartered airline, which is growing profitably in 2018, also is behind the recent 
decision.
"Ryanair's Polish airline, Ryanair Sun, will now offer over 10 aircraft to Polish tour operators, more than double the 
five aircraft offered in summer 2018. We expect few route closures from Dublin, although some routes may suffer 
frequency reductions," the airline said.
Due to the fleet reduction, Ryanair said it issued letters of protective notice to over 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew 
employees as their services "may not be required" from the end of October. 
"Ryanair will now begin the consultations with its people on redundancy, which, if redundancies are necessary, will 
be determined by Ryanair's assessment of flight performance, productivity, attendances, and base transfer 
requests," the company added. 
Dublin-based pilots and cabin crew member will be offered transfers to Poland for the winter season. 
Ryanair shares were trading up 1.8% at EUR14.23 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Investec said Wizz Air's first quarter results were "a little disappointing" as strikes 
pushed up cancellations and the central and eastern Europe-focused airline disappointed on ancillary revenue.
Investec kept its Hold rating on the stock with a 3,558p price target. Shares in Wizz Air were 3.5% lower at 3,440.00 
pence early Wednesday, among the worst performers in the FTSE 250.
Net income for the period was EUR50.0 million, down 14% on last year and sharply lower than Investec's forecast 
of EUR69.1 million.
The broker said the timing of Easter and air traffic control played a large role this in decline, with cancellations up 
more than five-fold to 145 in the period from 34 last year.
"We did not factor in enough of an impact from the timing of Easter and the impact on services, both through 
cancellations and delays, caused a 203% increase in compensation costs to EUR9.1 million, roughly double what 
we expected," said analyst Alex Paterson.
Wizz Air's results on Wednesday come after it, along with peers International Consolidated Airlines Group, Ryanair 
Holdings, easyJet, submitted complaints to the European Commission against France over the air traffic controller 
strikes.
The airlines, in a joint statement on Tuesday, claimed that France is breaking EU law by not enabling flights over 
the country during strikes, denying passengers the freedom to travel to unaffected member states.
In 2018 to date, French air strikes have nearly tripled from levels in 2017, and in June the French Senate confirmed 
that France alone is responsible for 33% of flight delays in Europe.
Wizz Air's revenue for the quarter of EUR553.4 million was also below Investec's forecast of EUR579 million, due to 
a EUR28.6 million shortfall in ancillary revenue. Passenger revenue was a bright spot, slightly ahead at EUR330.4 
million against Investec's expectation of EUR327.3 million.
IN THE KNOW: Strikes, Ancillary Sales Miss See Soft Wizz Air Results
The broker said it is comfortable with its forecasts, though said it sees downside risk to consensus, which lies at the 
top of Wizz Air's guided range for net profit in the year ending March 31 between EUR310 million to EUR340 
million. Investec forecasts EUR327 million.

Flights Cancelled During Another Strike By Ryanair Irish -Based Pilots

LONDON (Alliance News) - Dozens of Ryanair Holdings PLC's Irish-based pilots are staging their third 24-hour 
strike in an ongoing dispute over working arrangements including annual leave and promotions.
The industrial action has led to the cancellation of 16 flights affecting some 2,500 customers.
The 24-hour stoppage began at 1am on Tuesday as pilots picketed the airline's headquarters in Swords, Co Dublin.
The budget airline criticised the strikes as unnecessary and warned that if they continue, there could be job losses.
Trade union Forsa, which represents the pilots, hit out at the airline company.
A spokesman for the union said: "This kind of threatening statement is not conducive to building trust and reaching 
a resolution to the dispute, and Forsa doesn't accept that jobs or expansion in the airline need be put at risk by 
company management."
The union said that the pilots continue to seek a "fair and transparent method" to govern base transfers and related 
matters which they say is common practice in the industry.
The spokesman added: "At present, company management has total discretion on transfers, which can see pilots 
moved to bases thousands of miles from their homes and families.
"Most other airlines have a fair and transparent criteria, based on seniority, to govern pilot relocations."
Forsa and Ryanair management have met twice in the last two weeks, for some nine hours.
The union said that the discussions found common ground on the possibility of establishing a joint working group to 
thrash out the disputed issues, however the parties couldn't agree on terms of reference for such a group.
In a statement, Ryanair said that it is available to meet Forsa "at any time".
Flights Cancelled During Another Strike By Ryanair Irish -Based Pilots
"After three months and two meetings lasting over nine hours, Forsa still haven't responded to our written proposals 
on seniority, base transfers and annual leave, which addresses their claimed requirements.
"Sadly Forsa prefer to strike first rather than use strikes as a last resort.
"When Ryanair has already agreed pilot recognition deals in bigger markets like Italy and the UK, clearly it's for 
Forsa and 25% of the Irish pilots that are causing these problems in Ireland, not Ryanair."
Meanwhile, Ryanair cabin crew in Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Italy are going on strike on Wednesday and 
Thursday, leading to the cancellation of 600 flights over two days and affecting 100,00 passengers.
The airline will have to either refund the passengers or arrange alternative flights.
Unions in the countries say they want Ryanair staff to be employed according to the national legislation of the 
country they operate in, rather than that of Ireland.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, Ryanair Holdings PLC, easyJet PLC and 
Wizz Air Holdings PLC all have submitted complaints to the European Commission against France over the air 
traffic controller strikes, according to a joint statement issued Tuesday.
The airlines have claimed that France is breaking EU law by not enabling flights over the country during strikes, 
denying passengers the freedom to travel to unaffected member states.
The airlines stressed however that they were not questioning the right to strike.
In 2018 to date, French air strikes have nearly tripled from levels in 2017, and in June the French Senate confirmed 
that France alone is responsible for 33% of flight delays in Europe.
More than 16,000 flights have been delayed in June due to air traffic controller strikes, according to Eurocontrol.
"Europe’s ATC providers are reaching the point of meltdown with hundreds of flights being cancelled and delayed 
daily either because of ATC strikes or because Europe’s ATC don’t have enough staff. When Greece and Italy have 
ATC strikes, overflights continue as normal. Why won’t France do the same? ATC providers are hiding behind 
adverse weather and euphemisms such as "capacity restrictions" when the truth is they are not rostering enough air 
traffic controllers to cater for the number of flights that are scheduled to operate," said Ryanair Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary.
"These disruptions are unacceptable, and we call on Europe’s Governments and the EU Commission to take urgent 
and decisive action to ensure that ATC providers are fully staffed and that overflights are not affected when national 
strikes take place, as they repeatedly do in France," O'Leary added.
Shares in IAG were up 1.5% at 686.80 pence, Ryanair was down 1.4% at EUR14.31, easyJet up 1.0% at 1,604.50p 
and Wizz Air up 0.1% at 3,604.00 pence on Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC were trading lower on Monday after the Irish airline 
reported a 20% decline in profit while warning about a hard Brexit, pilot strikes and rising oil prices . 
Shares in Ryanair were down 5.8% at EUR14.60 on Monday.
For the three months ended June 30, the airline recorded profit after tax of EUR319 million, down from EUR397 
million in the comparative year ago period, on a revenue of EUR2.08 billion and EUR1.91 billion, respectively. 
The fall in profit was largely due to the timing of Easter, higher oil prices and pilot costs. Pretax profit including 
exceptional items came in at EUR345.4 million, down 22% from EUR443.7 million a year before. 
"The airline has certainly done a very good job so far at sweating its assets and making money from passengers 
beyond the price of an airline ticket. Yet first-quarter results would suggest it needs to do more to cope with higher 
oil prices, higher pilot costs and yet another bout of strikes," said broker AJ Bell's Russ Mould.
Last week, Ryanair said in a Twitter post that it will cancel up to 300 of its 2,400 daily flights. The cancellations will 
take place on Wednesday and Thursday to minimize disruption to customers from "unnecessary" strikes by some 
cabin crew in Belgium, Portugal and Spain.
Cabins Crew United, the union of Ryanair's European Network, announced earlier in the month that it will go on 
strike in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Belgium on Wednesday. The Union has been asking for an improvement in 
employee terms.
"We continue to see overcapacity in the European market, with Germany in particular very price competitive this 
summer. First quarter fares fell 4% to under EUR39 and we expect this weaker pricing environment (due to the 
World Cup, the Northern European heat wave and customer uncertainty about pilot strikes) to continue," Ryanair 
said on Monday.
IN DEPTH: Brexit, Pilot Strikes, Oil Woes Send Ryanair Into Tailspin
However, further strikes are expected as Ryanair is not prepared to concede to demands that will compromise its 
low-cost business model and lower airfares.
The company warned jobs could be at risk in light of the strike action.
"If these unnecessary strikes continue to damage customer confidence and forward prices/yields in certain country 
markets then we will have to review our winter schedule, which may lead to fleet reductions at disrupted bases and 
job losses in markets where competitor employees are interfering in our negotiations with our people and their 
unions. We cannot allow our customers flights to be unnecessarily disrupted by a tiny minority of pilots," Ryanair 
said. 
The Irish carrier said Monday it will retain its annual profit after tax guidance range of EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 
billion, but noted that the guidance was heavily depended on second-quarter fares, crew strikes, continuing air 
traffic control staff shortages and strikes, the absence of unforeseen security events, and no negative Brexit 
developments.
"With almost zero second half visibility, our second half guidance of broadly flat fares remains unchanged at this 
time," the company said. 
In light of Ryanair's murky outlook Investec placed its price target and recommendation on the stock Under Review.
The airline warned that it remained concerned over the danger of a "no-deal" Brexit in March 2019.
"While there is a view that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be 
implemented (and extended), recent events in the UK political sphere have added to this uncertainty, and we 
believe that the risk of a hard Brexit is being underestimated. It is likely that in the event of a hard Brexit our UK 
shareholders will be treated as non-EU," Ryanair noted. 
As such, the company said it could be forced to restrict the voting rights of all non-EU shareholders in the event of a 
hard Brexit, to ensure that it remains majority controlled by EU shareholders.
Shares in peers easyJet PLC and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines SA were lower in a read 
across from Ryanair, down 2.2% and 2.0% respectively. 
Last week, rival easyJet painted a rosy picture as it increased its guidance for full-year profit and capacity following 
an increase in third-quarter revenue. For the quarter ended June 30, total revenue increased by 9.4% to GBP1.51 
billion from GBP1.39 billion for the same period the year before, citing a benign competitive environment as a result 
of unfilled capacity left by collapsed holiday carrier Monarch Airlines. 
"You could argue that easyJet is more immune to the crew disruption angle, given its better relations with unions. 
However, it's difficult to argue that the other issues 'CEO'Leary' points to aren't applicable to such a close peer. 
Hence why the sector as a whole is having a bad day," said Mike Van Dulken, head of research at Accendo 
Markets.
In May, easyJet identified a "significant" opportunity to bolster its holiday offerings. The company said it would 
develop "closer and strong relationships" with selected hotel operators. 
"easyJet recently made plans to bulk up its package holidays business in order to capitalise on its strong brand and 
squeeze more money out of its customers. Ryanair also has a holiday business albeit not one it talks about much - 
perhaps this situation may change if easyJet makes progress with its proposition," Mould noted. 
Ryanair also bemoaned surging oil prices, with Brent rising to USD80 a barrel from USD50 a barrel within the space 
of eight months. 
The North Sea benchmark currently is trading at USD73.94. 
IN DEPTH: Brexit, Pilot Strikes, Oil Woes Send Ryanair Into Tailspin
The company said fuel and oil costs rose by 23% to EUR630.9 million due to higher fuel prices and an increase in 
the cost of carbon credits.
Elsewhere, Ryanair has been engaged in a spat with Deutsche Lufthansa AG after the German airline recalled nine 
planes it has leased to Laudamotion, a day after Ryanair was given the go-ahead by EU competition authorities to 
take over the Austrian budget carrier, which had been founded by race car driver Niki Lauda.
Ryanair estimates first-year losses for Laudamotion will increase to around EUR150 million from EUR100 million, 
due to capacity growth in Germany and Lufthansa not delivering aircraft as it was required.
The company's target is now to breakeven in three years, compared to Investec's expectation of 2 to 3 years 
previously.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said lower fares,  the earlier timing of Easter, and 
higher fuel and pilot costs resulted in a 20% drop in first quarter profit.
The Irish budget carrier also said it will retain its annual profit after tax guidance range of EUR1.25 billion to 
EUR1.35 billion, but noted that the guidance was heavily depended on second-quarter fares, crew strikes, 
continuing air traffic control staff shortages and strikes, the absence of unforeseen security events, and no negative 
Brexit developments.
For the three months ended June 30, the airline recorded profit after tax of EUR319 million, down from EUR397 
million in the comparative year ago period, on a revenue of EUR2.08 billion and EUR1.91 billion, respectively. 
"As previously guided, Q1 profit after tax fell by 20% to EUR319 million due to lower fares, the absence of half of 
Easter in the quarter, higher oil prices and pilot costs. Traffic grew 7% to 37.6 million, despite over 2,500 flight
cancellations caused by ATC staff shortages and ATC strikes," said Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary. 
Average fares in the quarter fell 4% to EUR38.68.
Pretax profit including exceptional items came in at EUR345.4 million, down 22% from EUR443.7 million a year 
before. 
Ryanair said it remains concerned by the danger of a hard, or no-deal, Brexit and may be forced to restrict the 
voting rights of all non-EU shareholders in the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure that Ryanair remains majority 
owned and controlled by European Union shareholders.
Ryanair in July secured European Union approval to raise its stake in the Austrian airline LaudaMotion to 75% from 
24.9%. The company expects LaudaMotion to lose around EUR150 million in its first year of operations due to 
substantial costs headwinds.  especially in fuel. LaudaMotion results will improve substantially to break even by 
year 3 of operations, the company said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum highlighted that Ryanair Holdings's first-quarter results were actually above 
consensus forecasts, despite being sharply lower year-on-year, though the broker noted that the weaker second-
quarter fare guidance from the Irish carrier is likely to be ill-received by investors.
Ryanair shares were down 4.5% at EUR14.80 Monday morning, with peers easyJet and British Airways owner 
International Consolidated Airlines down 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively.
Liberum said the first-quarter outturn, despite being sharply lower on last year, was above consensus - though light 
on the broker's own above-consensus forecasts.
For the three months ended June 30, the airline recorded profit after tax of EUR319 million, down from EUR397 
million a year ago, on a revenue of EUR2.08 billion and EUR1.91 billion respectively. 
The fall in profit was largely due to the timing of Easter, higher oil prices and pilot costs. Pretax profit including 
exceptional items came in at EUR345.4 million, down 22% from EUR443.7 million a year before. 
Liberum had seen revenue of EUR2.01 billion for the quarter, with consensus lying at EUR2.03 billion. The broker 
had forecast net profit of EUR326 million, though Ryanair beat consensus of EUR305 million with its EUR319 
million result.
The budget carrier held its annual profit after tax guidance range of EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but noted 
that this is heavily dependent on second-quarter fares, crew strikes, continuing air traffic control staff shortages, the 
absence of unforeseen security events, and no negative Brexit developments.
However, despite holding its full-year guidance Ryanair did say that second quarter fares are now only expected to 
rise by approximately 1%, previously guided to grow 4%. This is due to "the recent weaker fare environment" and 
the expected hit from crew strikes on forward pricing.
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Above Consensus, Second Quarter Outlook Drags
With "almost zero" second half visibility, the airline said its guidance of broadly flat fares over this period remains 
unchanged. Ancillary revenue continues to perform well, Ryanair added, but will not offset a EUR430 million higher 
fuel bill or a 6% increase in ex-fuel unit costs. 
Liberum said ancillary revenue was stronger than expected, though costs were higher than forecast, offsetting the 
ancillary performance. Averages fares fell 4%, with management citing overcapacity in the market, and Liberum 
estimating that non-fuel cost per passenger rose by more than 7%.
"We expect consensus to be little changed from its current level of net profit of EUR1.31 billion, slightly above the 
midpoint of management's guidance. However, we see the balance of risks being on the downside and the weaker 
unit revenue guidance for Q2 is likely to be taken poorly by the market, in our view," said Liberum.
Nonetheless, the broker said Ryanair current trades on a justified premium to the European airline sector. Ryanair 
trades at price-earnings ratio of 13.8 times, it noted, versus 8.6 times for the sector as a whole.
The budget airline is set to continue delivering "industry leading" margin and returning cash to shareholders despite 
a "substantial" capital expenditure programme. In addition, Liberum said Ryanair's decision to recognise unions 
should not take away its competitive advantage.
"Industrial action is clearly unwelcome, but it does not dilute Ryanair's sound and attractive long-term 
fundamentals," said Liberum.
The broker kept its Buy rating on the stock with a EUR18.50 price target unchanged.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Sentiment in Europe was soft at the start of the week, with the FTSE 100 lower at 
midday on Monday after US President Trump switched his focus to Iran from his ever-escalating tariff threats 
toward China. 
Airlines were among the worst performers in the blue-chip index following budget carrier Ryanair's first-quarter 
results, while Ascential was the biggest loser in the FTSE 250.
The FTSE 100 index was down 0.4%, or 31.92 points, at 7,646.87 Monday midday. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index 
was down 0.6%, or 114.32 points lower, at 20,811.36. The AIM All-Share index was down 0.4% at 1,090.16.
The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.4% at 12,959.79, the Cboe UK 250 was down 0.5% at 18,954.93, and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies was down 0.4% at 12,425.25.
In mainland Europe on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 0.6% and 0.2% 
respectively at midday.
"The FTSE is leading European markets lower, with Donald Trump driving risk aversion amid talk of further tariffs 
on China and war with Iran," said IG market analyst Joshua Mahony.
As markets were rattled on Friday by Trump's announcement he is "ready to go" to USD500 billion in import tariffs 
on Chinese goods, the US president over the weekend ramped up his rhetoric towards another country, Iran.
Following comments from Iranian President Hassan Rowhani on war and a threat to blockade Gulf oil, Trump 
addressed the Iranian leader in an all-capitalized message on Twitter.

"NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE US AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH 
FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE," he wrote.
Trump drew criticism from his European allies in May when he pulled out of the 2015 international nuclear 
agreement with Tehran and announced a resumption of US economic sanctions, which are still being restored.
Earlier Sunday, Rowhani had warned Trump not to escalate tensions with Iran: "Americans should know that peace 
with Iran is the mother of all peace...likewise a war would be the mother of all wars."
Markets in New York are set for a flat to lower open on Monday, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 seen unchanged 
but the tech-heavy Nasdaq set to fall 0.3%.
Before the US open on Monday, oilfield services firm Halliburton reported second-quarter earnings. The company's 
bottom line came in at USD511 million, or USD0.58 per share. This compares with USD28 million, or USD0.03 per 
share, in last year's second quarter. Revenue for the quarter rose 24% to USD6.15 billion from USD4.96 billion last 
year.
After the New York close Monday, Google parent Alphabet reports. Later in the week come results from the likes of 
Amazon, McDonald's, Twitter and Boeing.
In the economic calendar on Monday, the Chicago Fed national activity index is at 1330 BST, with US existing 
home sales at 1500 BST. Eurozone consumer confidence is also at 1500 BST.
In London, advertising agency WPP was up 2.2% after Sky News on Saturday reported the company is in early 
stage discussions to sell a minority 20% stake in its Chinese operations to Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent 
Holdings and China Media Capital Holdings. 
Sources told the news agency that the talks could take several months to conclude and is expected to value WPP 
China at between USD2 billion and USD2.5 billion.
GlaxoSmithKline was up 0.8% after the Financial Times late Friday said several top-ten investors" have been 
urging the drugmaker's board to spin off its Consumer division.
According to a newspaper source, Chairman Philip Hampton has been in talks over the possible creation of a 
stand-alone pharmaceuticals and vaccines company.
Towards the bottom of the FTSE 100 were airlines, with easyJet down 1.6% and International Consolidated Airlines 
down 1.6%. In the FTSE 250, Wizz Air was down 1.8%.
The companies were suffering from a negative read-across after budget carrier Ryanair reported a fall in first 
quarter profit and a cautious outlook for the second quarter. 
Ryanair was down 4.1% at midday.
For the three months ended June 30, the Irish airline recorded profit after tax of EUR319 million, down from 
EUR397 million a year ago, on revenue of EUR2.08 billion and EUR1.91 billion respectively. 
The budget carrier held its annual profit after tax guidance range of EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but noted 
that this is heavily dependent on second-quarter fares, crew strikes, continuing air traffic control staff shortages, the 
absence of unforeseen security events, and no negative Brexit developments.

In the FTSE 250, Ascential was the worst performer, down 4.3%.
The business events organiser recorded a pretax profit of GBP23.1 million for the six months ended June 30, down 
14% from GBP26.8 million last year. Revenue, however, rose to GBP188.9 million for the half from GBP165.1 
million. 
Ascential's group margin dipped to 32.0% from 36.8%. Exhibitions & Festivals margins fell to 49.7% from 55.5%, 
while information services unit recorded margins of 25.1% versus 28.8%.
Plastic products maker RPC was up 1.9% after the Telegraph over the weekend said Standard Life Aberdeen, a 
major shareholder in the plastic products maker, believes the company's low share price could spark bid interest 
from overseas rivals and private equity firms.
While the company was among the best performers in the FTSE 250 on Monday, its share price remains down 12% 
since the start of 2018.
Elsewhere on the London Main Market, retailer McColl's Retail Group dropped 12% after supply chain disruption hit 
its first-half results.
For the 26 weeks ended May 28, McColl's reported pretax profit of GBP2.3 million, nearly halved from the GBP4.5 
million posted last year. First half like-for-likes sales were down 2.7% due to supply chain disruption caused by the 
demise of wholesaler Palmer & Harvey.
Revenue, however, saw double-digit growth, rising by 19% to GBP601.2 million from GBP504.8 million the prior 
year. This was driven by the GBP117.0 million acquisition of 300 stores from The Co-operative Group.
The fall in interim profit was attributed to costs relating to the collapse of P&H, as well as health and safety breach 
fines and an unprofitable store closure programme.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London eased off their intraday lows as Monday's session progressed, 
though still started the week on a subdued note.
Investors continued to digest the prospect of further US-China tariffs, as well as heightened tensions between the 
US and Iran.
Airlines in London were dragged down by a first quarter update from Ryanair, while Hargreaves Lansdown fell on a 
broker rating downgrade and Ascential on its interim results.
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.3%, or 23.00 points at 7,655.79, having hit an intraday low of 7,621.75 earlier 
in the session. 
The FTSE 250 ended down 0.7%, or 155.30 points, at 20,770.38, and the AIM All-Share closed 0.5%, or 5.94 
points, at 1,088.63.
The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.3% at 12,973.38, the Cboe UK 250 closed 0.8% lower at 18,905.19, and the Cboe 
Small Companies ended down 0.5% at 12,406.09.
In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 0.4%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended 
down 0.1%.
"A tentative recovery has been seen today, with markets moving off the lows, particularly in Europe and the UK. A 
packed calendar for the rest of the week has meant that bullish moves have been limited in scope," said IG chief 
market analyst Chris Beauchamp.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Stocks Pare Losses Amid Subdued Start To Week
Risk-off trade dominated on Monday as investors continued to digest US President Donald Trump's announcement 
on Friday that he is "ready to go" to USD500 billion in import tariffs on Chinese goods.
In the UK, the pound was largely unchanged at the London equities close Monday, quoted at USD1.3104 compared 
to USD1.3107 at the close on Friday.
New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned during a visit to Germany on Monday of the rising threat of a no-deal 
Brexit "by accident".
Hunt called on EU negotiators to take a more constructive role in Brexit negotiations with Britain, which is scheduled 
to leave the 28-member bloc on March 29 next year.
There is now "a very real threat of a Brexit no-deal by accident, and this is because many people in the EU are 
thinking that they just have to wait long enough and Britain will blink," Hunt said after a meeting with German 
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.
"The UK government seems to have decided on this kind of tough talk approach ahead of the next round of 
negotiations, both for home consumption and in order to send a strong message to the EU. It looks like we are in for 
a difficult few weeks," said IG's Beauchamp.
In data from the eurozone, consumer confidence suffered less-than-expected in July. The consumer confidence 
index eased to minus 0.6 from minus 0.5 in June, an improvement on the forecast of minus 0.7. July's reading still 
marked the lowest level in nine months.
The euro stood at USD1.1702 at the European equities close Monday, against USD1.1707 at the same time on 
Friday.
Stocks in New York were lower at the London equities close, with the Down Jones down 0.1%, the S&P 500 index 
0.1% lower, and the Nasdaq Composite shedding 0.2%. 
To come after Wall Street closes are earnings from Google parent Alphabet.
Oilfield services firm Halliburton, having published results before the market opened, was 7.6% lower in New York 
after reporting a set of second quarter figures which were in line with analyst expectations. 
Halliburton posted adjusted earnings per share of USD0.58, above USD0.03 last year. The company's revenue for 
the quarter rose 24% to USD6.15 billion from USD4.96 billion last year.
Brent oil was quoted at USD73.87 a barrel at the London equities close Monday from USD72.86 late Friday.
Oil was higher as Trump, taking a break from escalating tensions with China, turned his focus to Iran over the 
weekend on Twitter.
Following comments from Iranian President Hassan Rowhani on war and a threat to blockade Gulf oil, Trump 
addressed the Iranian leader in an all-capitalised message on Twitter.
"NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE US AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH 
FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE," he wrote.
Trump drew criticism from his European allies in May when he pulled out of the 2015 international nuclear 
agreement with Tehran and announced a resumption of US economic sanctions, which are still being restored.

In other commodities, gold was quoted at USD1,224.19 an ounce at the London equities close Monday against 
USD1,228.31 at the close on Friday.
In London, WPP closed 3.1% higher after Sky News over the weekend reported the advertising firm is in early stage 
discussions to sell a 20% stake in its Chinese operations to Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and China 
Media Capital Holdings.
Sources told Sky that the talks could take several months to conclude, and are expected to value WPP China at 
between USD2 billion and USD2.5 billion.
GlaxoSmithKline also rose on a press report, gaining 0.8% after the Financial Times on Friday said the drugmaker 
is considering a spin-off of its Consumer unit, which includes brands such as Aquafresh toothpaste, Theraflu flu 
treatment and Panadol pain relief.
According to the newspaper, "several top-ten investors" have been urging the company's board to spin off Glaxo's 
consumer division. According to a newspaper source, Chairman Philip Hampton has been in talks over the possible 
creation of a stand-alone pharmaceuticals and vaccines company.
Towards the other end of the index were airlines, with easyJet ending down 1.9% and International Consolidated 
Airlines off 1.6%. 
This was due to a negative read-across from budget carrier Ryanair, which reported a fall in first quarter profit and a 
subdued second quarter outlook.
For the three months ended June 30, the airline recorded profit after tax of EUR319 million, down from EUR397 
million a year ago, on a revenue of EUR2.08 billion and EUR1.91 billion respectively.
The fall in profit was largely due to the timing of Easter, higher oil prices and pilot costs. Pretax profit including 
exceptional items came in at EUR345.4 million, down 22% from EUR443.7 million a year before.
Despite holding its full-year guidance, Ryanair said that second quarter fares are now only expected to rise by 
approximately 1%, previously guided to grow 4%. This is due to "the recent weaker fare environment" and the 
expected hit from crew strikes on forward pricing.
Ryanair closed down 6.4%.
Fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown ended 1.6% lower after Jefferies downgraded its rating on the company 
to Underperform from Hold.
In the FTSE 250, Ascential closed 4.1% lower as the worst performer in the index as first half profit slipped.
The business events organiser recorded a pretax profit of GBP23.1 million for the six months to June 30, 14% lower 
than GBP26.8 million last year. This was despite revenue climbing 14% to GBP188.9 million from GBP165.1 
million.
The group margin dipped to 32.0% from 36.8%. Exhibitions & Festivals margins fell to 49.7% from 55.5%, while 
information services unit recorded margins of 25.1% versus 28.8%.
Outsourcer Capita shed 2.7% after the Financial Times reported on Monday its British military's fire and rescue 
services contract has been suspended after a challenge from Serco.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Stocks Pare Losses Amid Subdued Start To Week
Capita in June won the fire and rescue services contract, but a UK government assessment of the company had 
given the outsourcer the riskiest possible rating. Citing documents, the FT reported that Capita scored 10 out of 10 
for risk, with 1 indicating the lowest probability of distress and 10 the highest. Serco scored seven out of 10 for risk 
in the assessment.
The UK defence ministry confirmed that the contract award has been suspended until a legal challenge is resolved, 
the FT reported. Serco closed down 1.2%.
Elsewhere on the Main Market, newsagent operator McColl's Retail Group tumbled 13% as interim profit halved.
For the 26 weeks ended May 28, McColl's reported pretax profit of GBP2.3 million, nearly halved from the GBP4.5 
million posted last year. First half like-for-likes sales were down 2.7% due to supply chain disruption caused by the 
demise of wholesaler Palmer & Harvey.
Revenue, however, saw double-digit growth, rising by 19% to GBP601.2 million from GBP504.8 million the prior 
year. This was driven by the GBP117.0 million acquisition of 300 stores from The Co-operative Group.
The fall in interim profit was attributed to costs relating to the collapse of P&H, as well as health and safety breach 
fines and an unprofitable store closure programme. 
"Investors will want reassurance that it is only experiencing short term pains and that the strategic developments in 
the business will result in longer term gains," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
In the economic events calendar on Tuesday there are manufacturing and services PMI readings from France, 
Germany, eurozone and the US at 0800 BST, 0830 BST, 0900 BST and 1445 BST respectively. 
The CBI industrial trends survey is at 1100 BST. Before this, the latest grocery share figures from Kantar 
Worldpanel for the 12 weeks ending July 15 are due at 0800 BST.
In the UK corporate calendar there are full year results from personal care products maker PZ Cussons and online 
spreadbetting firm IG Group. There are also half year results from retail property investors Hammerson, precision 
instruments supplier Spectris and tonic water maker Fevertree Drinks.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings said lower fares, the earlier timing of Easter, and higher fuel and pilot costs resulted in a 20% 
drop in first quarter profit. The Irish budget carrier also said it will retain its annual profit after tax guidance range of 
EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but noted that the guidance was heavily depended on second-quarter fares, 
crew strikes, continuing air traffic control staff shortages and strikes, the absence of unforeseen security events, 
and no negative Brexit developments. Ryanair said it remains concerned by the danger of a hard, or no-deal, Brexit 
and may be forced to restrict the voting rights of all its non-EU shareholders in the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure 
that Ryanair remains majority owned and controlled by EU shareholders.
----------
BHP Billiton confirmed it has received notice of a class action lawsuit in Australia over the Samarco dam failure, 
responding to media reports. The class action, which was reported by the Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday, was 
filed in the Federal Court of Australia in the State of Victoria. The SMH said around 3,000 investors had signed up 
to the class action, which alleges the miner breached disclosure obligations and "engaged in misleading and 
deceptive conduct". The Samarco dam, in Brazil's Minas Gerais state, failed in November 2015, flooding the 
surrounding area and causing multiple deaths. 
----------
Ascential said lower margins and earnings for its core exhibitions and festivals business led to a drop in first half 
profit. The business events organiser recorded pretax profit of GBP23.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 
down 14% from GBP26.8 million in the comparative year ago period, on revenue of GBP188.9 million and 
GBP165.1 million, respectively. Group margins dipped to 32.0% from 36.8%. Exhibitions & Festivals margins fell to 
49.7% from 55.5%, while information services unit recorded margins of 25.1% versus 28.8%

Hammerson said it has sold two UK retail parks for a combined GBP164 million. The first is the Imperial retail park 
in Bristol, and the second is the Fife Central park in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, with both being sold to real estate firm 
Capreon. Hammerson said the sales price represents an initial net yield of 7%, and a discount of around 10% to its 
December book value. The Imperial retail park was bought by Hammerson in 2012, and covers 32,200 square 
metres. Fife Central was purchased in 2005, and covers 30,200 square metres.
----------
McColl's Retail Group said first half profit nearly halved on the back of supply chain disruptions. For the 26 weeks 
ended May 28, McColl's reported pretax profit of GBP2.3 million, down from GBP4.5 million for the same period the 
year before. The drop in profit was primarily attributed to costs relating to the collapse of wholesaler Palmer & 
Harvey, health and safety breach fines and an unprofitable store closure programme. First half like-for-likes sales 
were down 2.7% due to supply chain disruption caused by the demise of Palmer & Harvey. The company 
separately said Chief Financial Officer Simon Fuller will be leaving the company to join newspaper publisher Reach 
in the same role.

MARKETS
----------
London shares were lower as global trade tensions persist. The pound was firm against the dollar after after US 
President Donald Trump accused the EU and China of manipulating their currencies. Wall Street was pointed to a 
lower open with Google parent Alphabet reporting earnings after the New York market close.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Europe must "show much more flexibility and creativity" to avoid a 'no deal 
by accident' situation post-Brexit. Hunt is meeting German Foreign Secretary Heiko Maas to discuss a range of 
issues including Britain's leaving of the European Union, Nato, the Western Balkans and Iran. Britain will leave the 
EU in less than 250 days following the triggering of Article 50 in March 2017. The former health secretary said: "I 
will…be clear that our European partners must show much more flexibility and creativity in negotiations if we are to 
avoid a 'no deal by accident' scenario."
----------
The UK could refuse to pay its GBP39 billion divorce bill to Brussels if it does not get a trade deal, Brexit Secretary 
Dominic Raab has signalled. Raab said there had to be "conditionality" under the Article 50 withdrawal mechanism 
between settling Britain's exit payment and creating a new relationship with the EU.
----------
British households' finance outlook turned positive for the first time since March 2016, while their financial pressures 
softened in July, results of a survey by IHS Markit and financial information provider Ipsos Mori revealed. The 
seasonally adjusted Household Finance Index rose to 44.6 in July from 43.6 in June. However, a score below 50 
suggests pessimism regrading finances among the UK households. The index measuring the outlook for financial 
well-being over the next twelve months, climbed to 51.3 in July from 48.2 in the previous month. A continued solid 
increase in income from employment and softer inflationary pressures combined to help ease the perceived strain 
on current finances.

The International Monetary Fund warned Saturday that the growing trade war between the US, China and the EU 
could significantly harm the global economy. "The impact that it could have on GDP, which in the worst case 
scenario under current measures...is in the range of 0.5% of GDP on a global basis," IMF chief Christine Lagarde 
said at a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Buenos Aires. The IMF calculated various 
scenarios emanating from the US' decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, and punitive tariffs in response 
from China and the EU. Under the worst scenario of the tariffs shattering investor confidence, worldwide growth in 
2020 could be reduced by 0.5%, or approximately USD430 billion less than previously forecast, the IMF 
determined. Although all countries would be negatively impacted by the trade war, the US economy would be 
particularly hard hit as scores of American products could be hit with retaliatory tariffs, IMF experts said.
----------
US President Donald Trump gave an emphatic warning late Sunday to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, as US 
top diplomat Mike Pompeo urged the world to join Washington in re-introducing sanctions on Iran. Following 
comments from Rowhani on war and a threat to blockade Gulf oil, Trump addressed the Iranian leader in an all-
capitalized message on Twitter. "NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE US AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER 
CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE," 
he wrote. He said that the US was "NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED 
WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!" Meanwhile, in a speech in Los Angeles, Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo highlighted ongoing protests in Iran to urge international support for Washington's effort to 
economically pressure the Iranian government.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings said Monday that lower fares, the earlier timing of Easter, and higher 
fuel and pilot costs resulted in a 20% drop in first quarter profit.
For the three months ended June 30, the airline recorded profit after tax of EUR319 million, down from EUR397 
million in the comparative year ago period, on a revenue of EUR2.08 billion and EUR1.91 billion, respectively.
The Irish budget carrier said it will retain its annual profit after tax guidance range of EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 
billion, but noted that the guidance was heavily depended on second-quarter fares, crew strikes, continuing air 
traffic control staff shortages and strikes, the absence of unforeseen security events, and no negative Brexit 
developments.
However, Ryanair said it remains "concerned by the danger of a hard ('no-deal') Brexit in March 2019", adding:
"We believe that the risk of a hard Brexit is being underestimated. It is likely that in the event of a hard Brexit our UK 
shareholders will be treated as non-EU. We may be forced to restrict the voting rights of all non-EU shareholders in 
the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure that Ryanair remains majority owned and controlled by EU shareholders."
"We have applied for a UK AOC to protect our domestic UK routes and hope to receive it before the end of 2018."

Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton confirmed it has received notice of a class action lawsuit in Australia over the 
Samarco dam failure, responding to media reports. The class action, which was reported by the Sydney Morning 
Herald on Sunday, was filed in the Federal Court of Australia in the State of Victoria. The SMH said around 3,000 
investors had signed up to the class action, which alleges the miner breached disclosure obligations and "engaged 
in misleading and deceptive conduct".

Anglo American Platinum reported a swing to an interim profit, while also reintroducing its halfway-point dividend. 
Amplats, majority-owned by Anglo American PLC, reported a pretax profit of ZAR3.20 billion for the six months to 
June, compared to a ZAR1.16 billion loss a year earlier. It also has, as of June 30, returned to a positive net cash 
position of ZAR500 million, compared to net debt of ZAR1.8 billion a year earlier. As a result, Amplats is paying a 
ZAR3.74 per share dividend for the period, having not paid one a year prior. Amplats also said Monday it has 
bought Glencore's 39% interest in their Motololo joint venture for ZAR800 million up front, approximately.

The chief executive of Airbus suggested in an interview with the Sunday Times merging the Airbus jet fighter 
business with that of BAE Systems to create a pan-European military aircraft company that could compete with US 
aerospace giants. Tom Enders told the newspaper it is time to "seriously look at consolidating and coalescing 
efforts eventually to one". BAE unveiled its concept for a sixth-generation jet fighter last week at the Farnborough 
International Airshow and called for international help to turn the Tempest concept into reality. The UK government 
has committed GBP2 billion to the project, but that is a fraction of the total GBP10 billion or more needed to build 
the aircraft, the Sunday Times noted.

Events and publishing firm Ascential said it made strong strategic progress and achieved organic growth in the first 
half of its financial year. For the half year ending June 30, revenue increased 14% to GBP188.9 million from 
GBP165.1 million the year before. Pretax profit came in at GBP35.3 million down from GBP42.7 million the year 
before. Ascential declared an interim dividend of 1.9 pence up from 1.8p last year. "In the last six months we have 
made considerable progress with our strategic vision: enabling our customers to succeed in the digital economy. It 
is particularly pleasing that we have delivered strong organic growth from our products in both their live and digital 
formats," said CEO Duncan Painter.

Paragon Banking Group said it continues to operate in line with the board's expectations. The lender said that, for 
its financial third quarter ended June 30, mortgage lending totalled GBP409.4 million and GBP1.13 billion so far in 
financial 2018. The company also said it completed the purchase of residential property development finance 
business Titlestone. Paragon said Titlestone will enhance profits by a high single-digit percentage in 2019 and 
accelerate and broaden Paragon's prospects within the residential property lending space. "The core buy-to-let

business continues to see strong demand from professional landlords and the addition of Titlestone is expected to 
accelerate the growth of our Commercial Lending arm. We remain on track to achieve our 2018 targets and the 
business is well-placed to make further strong progress in 2019," said Chief Executive Nigel Terrington.

Online estate agency Purplebricks Group confirmed it is eyeing German and European firms for acquisition as it 
continues to expand its overseas footprint. Chief Executive Michael Bruce, who founded the firm with his brother 
Kenny in 2012, told the Press Association the group is hoping to replicate the success of a recent deal in Canada, 
which has propelled it into that market. It has Germany and Europe in its sights following a GBP125 million 
investment boost from German publishing giant Axel Springer when it took an 11.5% stake in Purplebricks in 
March. But Bruce said the group is not planning to launch into a new market from scratch for the time being while it 
concentrates on bedding in existing operations across the UK, Australia and north America.

COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL
----------
Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne is stepping down from the Italian-American carmaker 
due to health issues, the company's board said Saturday. The 66-year-old is unable to return to work as a result of 
unexpected complications following surgery on his shoulder, Fiat-Chrysler said in a statement. In charge since 
2004, Marchionne is credited with saving Fiat from bankruptcy and overseeing its merger with Chrysler. Fiat-
Chrysler includes other brands such as Ram, Dodge, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. Mike Manley, who has been 
among the carmaker's top leadership ranks for several years, will take over as chief executive. Marchionne said 
earlier this year that he planned to retire in 2019. He will also be stepping down from his role at the helm of luxury 
sports car manufacturer Ferrari.
----------
Tesla has asked some suppliers to refund a portion of what the electric-car company has spent previously, an 
appeal that reflects the auto maker's urgency to sustain operations during a critical production period, the Wall 
Street Journal reported citing a memo that was sent to a supplier last week. The Silicon Valley electric-car company 
said it is asking its suppliers for cash back to help it become profitable, according to the newspaper. Tesla 
requested the supplier return what it calls a meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016.
----------
Dutch consumer electronics giant Philips Electronics reported its second-quarter net income was EUR2 million, 
compared to EUR289 million a year ago. Earnings per share were breakeven, compared to earnings of EUR0.27 a 
year ago. The prior year results included operating results of Signify, formerly Philips Lighting, and the combined 
Lumileds and Automotive businesses, which have subsequently been de-consolidated. Net income from continuing 
operations was EUR186 million or EUR0.30 per share, higher than prior year's EUR161 million or EUR0.20 per 
share. Sales in the quarter were EUR4.29 billion, slightly lower than prior year's EUR4.294 billion. Comparable 
sales growth was 4%, and comparable order intake increased 9%.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks fell on Monday as trade tensions persisted 
and investors braced for a busy week of corporate earnings.
The US dollar slumped after US President Donald Trump accused the EU and China of manipulating their 
currencies.
In addition, Trump talked of more tariffs on China and continued his attack on the Federal Reserve for raising 
interest rates, saying tightening penalizes the US for doing well.
Meanwhile, the weekend's G20 meeting of finance ministers in Argentina did little to allay fears of a global trade 
war.
Investors looked ahead to an important meeting on trade between Trump and European Commission President 
Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House on Wednesday, with EU officials saying they have low expectations for a 
positive outcome.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.1% at 385.16, on track for its third straight session of 
losses.
The German DAX was down about 0.1%, while France's CAC 40 index and the UK's FTSE 100 were down around

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Monday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
GlaxoSmithKline, up 0.5%. The pharmaceutical company is considering splitting the pharmaceutical company due 
to pressure from investors, the Financial Times reported late on Friday. According to the newspaper, "several top-
ten investors" have been urging the company's board to spin off Glaxo's consumer division. According to a 
newspaper source, Chairman Philip Hampton has been in talks over the possible creation of a stand-alone 
pharmaceuticals and vaccines company.
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
easyJet, down 1.8%, International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 1.7%. The airlines were suffering a negative 
read-across from peer Ryanair Holdings' first quarter results. The Irish carrier said lower fares, the earlier timing of 
Easter, and higher fuel and pilot costs resulted in a 20% drop in first quarter profit. Ryanair said it remains 
concerned by the danger of a hard, or no-deal, Brexit and may be forced to restrict the voting rights of all non-EU 
shareholders in the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure that Ryanair remains majority owned and controlled by 
European Union shareholders. For the three months ended June 30, the airline recorded profit after tax of EUR319 
million, down from EUR397 million in the comparative year ago period, on a revenue of EUR2.08 billion and 
EUR1.91 billion, respectively. Ryanair shares were down 5.2%. Midcap peer Wizz Air was down 2.5%.
----------
Hargreaves Lansdown, down 1.0%. The fund supermarket was cut to Underperform from Hold by Jefferies. 
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: McColl's Retail Sinks After Profit Slumps
----------
Ascential, down 4.2%. The business events organiser said lower margins and earnings for its core exhibitions and 
festivals business led to a drop in first half profit. Ascential recorded pretax profit of GBP23.1 million for the six 
months ended June 30, down 14% from GBP26.8 million in the comparative period a year ago, on revenue of 
GBP188.9 million and GBP165.1 million, respectively. Group margins dipped to 32.0% from 36.8%. Exhibitions & 
Festivals margins fell to 49.7% from 55.5%, while information services unit recorded margins of 25.1% versus 
28.8%. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation dipped to GBP60.4 million from 
GBP60.8 million. 
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Keras Resources, up 18%. The miner said it has secured permission to undertake a bulk sampling metallurgical 
testwork programme at the Nayega manganese project in northern Togo. Keras said the bulk sampling will include 
processing of 10,000 tonnes of beneficiated manganese ore, by a major producer of manganese-based alloys, for 
large scale metallurgical testwork, to assess the suitability of the ore in their manganese smelting facilities. The test 
work is estimated to cost USD1.5 million and will be fully funded by the unnamed third-party manganese end-user. 
Keras Resources is targeting a 10 millimetre to 75 mm manganese product from a simplified washing, scrubbing 
and screening operation. This will provide real-time data with respect to the operating costs and logistics of 
exporting beneficiated manganese to third party end-users, the company said.
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
McColl's Retail Group, down 12%. The convenience store chain said first half profit nearly halved on the back of 
supply chain disruptions. For the 26 weeks ended May 28, McColl's reported pretax profit of GBP2.3 million, down 
from GBP4.5 million for the same period the year before. The drop in profit was primarily attributed to costs relating 
to the collapse of wholesaler Palmer & Harvey, health and safety breach fines and an unprofitable store closure 
programme. First half like-for-likes sales were down 2.7% due to supply chain disruption caused by the demise of 
Palmer & Harvey. The company separately said Chief Financial Officer Simon Fuller will be leaving the company to 
join newspaper publisher Reach in the same role. In addition, Liberum cut the stock to Hold from Buy.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are seen opening lower on Monday as global trade tensions refused 
to dissipate, while Ryanair reported a substantial drop in first-quarter profit.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index will open down 21.79 points at 7,657.00. The blue chip index closed down 
0.1% at 7,678.79 on Friday.
Worries about trade wars weighed on investor sentiment as G20 finance ministers issued a warning on Sunday that 
"heightened trade and geopolitical tensions" posed an increased risk to global growth.
In addition, the International Monetary Fund warned Saturday that the growing trade war between the US, China 
and the EU could significantly harm the global economy.
"The impact that it could have on GDP, which in the worst case scenario under current measures...is in the range of 
0.5% of GDP on a global basis," IMF chief Christine Lagarde said at a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central 
bank governors in Buenos Aires.
"No progress at the G20 over trade issues means trade jitters are being sent through the markets. Asian equity 
markets dropped lower as traders took risk off the table, whilst flows into safe haven assets were once again on the 
increase. European futures are also pointing to a lower start after the opening bell," said London Capital Group's 
Jasper Lawler.
The economic events calendar in Monday has US existing home sales figures and eurozone consumer confidence 
data at 1500 BST.

Sterling was firm against the dollar, quoted at USD1.3142 early Monday, against USD1.3107 at the London equities 
close on Friday.
UK households' finance outlook turned positive for the first time since March 2016, while their financial pressures 
softened in July, results of a survey by IHS Markit and financial information provider Ipsos Mori revealed.
The seasonally adjusted Household Finance Index, or HFI, rose to 44.6 in July from 43.6 in June. However, a score 
below 50 suggests pessimism regrading finances among the UK households.
In early corporate news, Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton confirmed it has received notice of a class action 
lawsuit in Australia over the Samarco dam failure, responding to media reports.
The class action, which was reported by the Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday, was filed in the Federal Court of 
Australia in the State of Victoria.
The SMH said around 3,000 investors had signed up to the class action, which alleges the miner breached 
disclosure obligations and "engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct".
The chief executive of Airbus suggested in an interview with the Sunday Times merging the Airbus jet fighter 
business with that of BAE Systems to create a pan-European military aircraft company that could compete with US 
aerospace giants.
Tom Enders told the newspaper it is time to "seriously look at consolidating and coalescing efforts eventually to 
one".
BAE unveiled its concept for a sixth-generation jet fighter last week at the Farnborough International Airshow and 
called for international help to turn the Tempest concept into reality. The UK government has committed GBP2 
billion to the project, but that is a fraction of the total GBP10 billion or more needed to build the aircraft, the Sunday 
Times noted.
Ryanair Holdings said lower fares, the earlier timing of Easter, and higher fuel and pilot costs resulted in a 20% 
drop in first quarter profit.
The Irish budget carrier also said it will retain its annual profit after tax guidance range of EUR1.25 billion to 
EUR1.35 billion, but noted that the guidance was heavily depended on second-quarter fares, crew strikes, 
continuing air traffic control staff shortages and strikes, the absence of unforeseen security events, and no negative 
Brexit developments.
For the three months ended June 30, the airline recorded profit after tax of EUR319 million, down from EUR397 
million in the comparative year ago period, on a revenue of EUR2.08 billion and EUR1.91 billion, respectively. 
Events and publishing firm Ascential said it made strong strategic progress and achieved organic growth in the first 
half of its financial year.
For the half year ending June 30, revenue increased 14% to GBP188.9 million from GBP165.1 million the year 
before. Pretax profit came in at GBP35.3 million down from GBP42.7 million the year before.
Ascential declared an interim dividend of 1.9 pence up from 1.8p last year. 
"In the last six months we have made considerable progress with our strategic vision: enabling our customers to 
succeed in the digital economy. It is particularly pleasing that we have delivered strong organic growth from our 
products in both their live and digital formats," said CEO Duncan Painter.

Paragon Banking Group said it continues to operate in line with the board's expectations. 
The lender said that, for its financial third quarter ended June 30, mortgage lending totalled GBP409.4 million and 
GBP1.13 billion so far in financial 2018. The company also said it completed the purchase of residential property 
development finance business Titlestone. Paragon said Titlestone will enhance profits by a high single-digit 
percentage in 2019 and accelerate and broaden Paragon's prospects within the residential property lending space.
"The core buy-to-let business continues to see strong demand from professional landlords and the addition of 
Titlestone is expected to accelerate the growth of our Commercial Lending arm. We remain on track to achieve our 
2018 targets and the business is well-placed to make further strong progress in 2019," said Chief Executive Nigel 
Terrington.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.4%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.8%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.2%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said it has signed a cabin crew union recognition 
agreement with FIT CISL, which will join ANPAC and ANPAV as a joint representative body for directly employed 
cabin crew in Italy.
FIT CISL is a national Italian organisation, which represents the employees working in the transport industry.
"We are pleased to sign this cabin crew recognition agreement today with FIT CISL in Italy," said Chief People 
Officer Eddie Wilson.
The agreement follows Ryanair's December announcement that it was willing to recognise unions for collective 
bargaining purposes. To-date, over 66% of the company's cabin crew is covered by recognition agreements,
Italy accounts for over 80 of Ryanair's 400 plus aircraft fleet and 20% of Ryanair's cabin crew.
In March, Ryanair signed a union recognition agreement with ANPAC, the Italian Airline Pilots Association, which 
will be the sole representative body for Ryanair pilots in Italy. Also, in June, Ryanair signed a deal with ANPAV, the 
Professional National Flight Assistants Association. 
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.7% at EUR15.62 on Friday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it now recognised a German-
based cabin crew as it continues the process of engaging with unions more closely.
Ryanair now recognises the Ver.di Union which covers the German market. Ver.di will now be the representative 
body for all directly employed cabin crew operating on its aircraft in Germany.
"We are pleased to sign this cabin crew recognition agreement with Ver.di in Germany," Ryanair Chief People 
Officer Eddie Wilson said. "This is a further sign of the progress Ryanair is making with trade unions since our 
December 2017 decision to recognise unions, with over 60% of our cabin crew now covered by recognition 
agreements."
The Ver.di move follows Ryanair's recognition of a number of unions following a decision to do so in December for 
the purposes of agreeing collective labour agreements or CLA deals. 
In early June, Ryanair signed a recognition deal with Italian unions ANPAV for cabin crew operating in that country. 
Shortly after, Ryanair also signed a similar pact with UK union Unite.
"We hope to announce further agreements over the coming weeks, in those countries where unions have 
approached these negotiations in a practical and positive manner," Wilson added. 
"As this growing number of pilot and cabin crew recognition agreements confirms, we are making progress and 
confounding those sceptics who claimed that our December 2017 decision was not real or genuine, Wilson 
continued. "We look forward to working closely with both Ver.di, and their Company Council in negotiating a CLA for 
our directly employed German based cabin crew." 
Shares in Ryanair were 0.2% lower at EUR15.88 on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Unilever said a truckers strike in Brazil, weakening of economic conditions in Argentina, and adverse currency 
movements resulted in a year-on-year drop in sales and profit for the first half of 2018. The Anglo-Dutch consumer 
goods giant also said it will hold general meetings for Unilever NV and for Unilever PLC shareholders on October 
25 and 25, respectively, to vote on the company's previously announced business simplification plan, which 
includes abandoning its current dual-headed corporate structure and rebasing the company in the Netherlands. For 
the six months to June-end, the company recorded pretax profit of EUR4.34 billion, down 6.3% from EUR4.63 
billion in the year-ago period. Revenue fell 5.0% to EUR26.35 billion from EUR27.73 billion.
----------
Anglo American reported a solid increase in overall production for the second quarter of 2018. On a copper 
equivalent basis, production for the three months to June rose 6% year-on-year, which excludes the stoppage at its 
Minas-Rio mine in Brazil due to pipeline leaks. Anglo American's copper production for the second quarter was 12% 
higher year-on-year to 158,000 tonnes, while for the first six months of 2018 it rose 10% to 313,000 tonnes. The 
company, listed in both Johannesburg and London, has held its 2018 copper output guidance at between 630,000 
tonnes and 660,000 tonnes. 
----------
SSE said that its first quarter performance was hurt by the recent "warmer than average" UK temperatures, leading 
to a 10% drop in gas demand. The hot weather reduced first-quarter operating profit by GBP80 million and could 
"potentially" harm full-year results, the company added. In the three months to June 30, the energy company said 
that the temperature - being 1.5 degrees centigrade warmer than the thirty-year average - affected domestic gas 
demand. In addition to lower demand, gas prices were "persistently high" resulting in a "higher cost of energy" 
being consumed at lower volumes, the FTSE 100-listed company said.

----------
Ryanair Holdings said it now recognised a German-based cabin crew as it continues the process of engaging with 
unions more closely. Ryanair now recognises the Ver.di Union which covers the German market. Ver.di will now be 
the representative body for all directly employed cabin crew operating on its aircraft in Germany. "We are pleased 
to sign this cabin crew recognition agreement with Ver.di in Germany," Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson 
said. "This is a further sign of the progress Ryanair is making with trade unions since our December 2017 decision 
to recognise unions, with over 60% of our cabin crew now covered by recognition agreements."
----------
Sports Direct International said its "strategic investment" in department store chain Debenhams hurt profit in its 
recently-ended financial year. The retailer said pretax profit for the year to April 29 fell 73% to GBP77.5 million from 
GBP281.6 million reported a year earlier, while revenue rose 3.5% to GBP3.36 billion from GBP3.25 billion. On an 
underlying basis, pretax profit increased by 35% to GBP152.9 million from GBP113.7 million reported a year prior. 
The steep profit drop was largely driven by a GBP85.4 million hit following a reduction in value of Debenhams. 
During the year, Sports Direct increased its holding in Debenhams to 29.7%.
----------
Babcock International Group said it expects "low single digit" adjusted annual revenue growth as its defence 
revenue is hit by the creation of a new submarine agency by the UK government. The engineering services 
company said that the UK Defence Equipment & Support organisation created a new submarine delivery agency 
(SDA), with this restructuring taking a "temporary" blow at the company's defence revenue. This impact will result 
on "low single digit" revenue growth for the year to March 2019.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were mixed, with Unilever leading the blue chip risers and Babcock and Sports Direct weighing in 
the midcap index. The pound fell below the USD1.30 mark following disappointing UK retail sales data. Wall Street 
was pointed to a lower open with tobacco firm Philip Morris International reporting earnings before the opening bell 
and software giant Microsoft reporting after the market close. 
----------
FTSE 100: up 0.2% at 7,689.51
FTSE 250: down 0.5% at 20,885.31
AIM ALL-SHARE: down 0.2% at 1,095.23
GBP: down at USD1.2994 (USD1.3058)
EUR: down at USD1.1600 (USD1.1642)
GOLD: down at USD1,216.64 per ounce (USD1,223.17)
OIL (Brent): down at USD71.99 a barrel (USD72.21)
(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK retail sales unexpectedly declined in June, but the quarterly growth rate was the fastest since 2015, preliminary 
data from the Office for National Statistics showed. Retail sales dropped 0.5% from the previous month, while 
economists' were looking for a 0.2% increase. The decline came after a two months of strong growth. In May, sales 
rose 1.4%. Continued growth in food sales was offset by declining spending in many other shops as consumers 
stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave, ONS senior statistician Rhian 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Unilever Sales, Profit Down Before Head Office Move
Murphy said. In the three months to June, sales rose 2.1%, marking the fastest growth since February 2015. On a 
year-on-year basis, retail sales grew 3% in June after 4.5% rise in May. Economists had forecast 3.5% growth.
----------
A senior official at the UK Financial Conduct Authority told leading financial services firms they should be prepared 
for a "hard" Brexit as the UK prepares to leave the EU in March 2019. FCA Executive Director of International 
Nausicaa Delfas - in post since February - told an event in London organised by Bloomberg and TheCityUK that 
"with eight months until we exit the European Union in March 2019, it is important we all – regulators and industry - 
continue to plan for a range of scenarios." Delfas emphasised the FCA "takes no position on whether Brexit is a 
good or bad thing in itself" but was focused on making financial markets "work well". The FCA is working on the 
assumption that an initial transition period operates between March 2019 - when Brexit is enacted - and the end of 
2020. 
----------
UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab holds talks in Brussels with the EU's chief negotiator as the government 
attempts to try and steady its withdrawal strategy after two weeks of turmoil rocked the Tory party. Raab's 
encounter with Michel Barnier on Thursday will be his first in the role of Brexit Secretary after David Davis quit the 
post in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Chequers Cabinet compromise on withdrawal aims. The meeting 
comes as Tory former Cabinet minister Lord Chris Patten predicted there could be an emergency Brexit general 
election in the autumn. The talks follow an extraordinary fortnight for the government in which the Cabinet agreed a 
compromise deal on Brexit only for Davis and Boris Johnson to quit May's top team as a result. After Johnson used 
his resignation statement in the Commons to call for the PM to abandon her "miserable" version of Brexit, May's 
former joint chief of staff Nick Timothy said the current situation was "deeply depressing".
----------
The UK prime minister makes her first visit to the Irish border since the Brexit referendum. Theresa May has been 
criticised for not hearing first-hand the concerns of locals living and working near what is to become the UK's only 
land border with the European Union. The border remains a crucial sticking point in Brexit negotiations with the EU, 
amid a stand-off between the UK and Brussels on how to maintain free flow of movement across the 310-mile 
frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. May will meet business representatives on the Northern 
Ireland side of the border on Thursday afternoon. On Friday, she will deliver a speech in Belfast focusing on how 
her vision of Brexit, outlined in last week's Government white paper, will impact Northern Ireland and the border.
----------
The US Commerce Department is investigating the national security impact of uranium imports, launching a 
process that could lead to tariffs. The formal probe, which follows a petition filed by US uranium mining companies, 
is to examine whether the current "quantity and circumstances" of imports of uranium ore and uranium products 
threaten national security, the department said in a statement. The investigation will cover the entire uranium 
sector, including mining, enrichment and uses in defence and industrial applications.

Lufthansa And Ryanair In Spat Over Planes Leased To Laudamotion
Lufthansa And Ryanair In Spat Over Planes Leased To Laudamotion

FRANKFURT (Alliance News) - Lufthansa AG on Friday recalled nine planes it has leased to Laudamotion, a day 
after Ryanair Holdings PLC was given the go-ahead by EU competition authorities to take over the Austrian budget 
carrier.
Justifying the step, Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, said Laudamotion had "repeatedly 
failed to make the agreed payments." The recall has yet to take effect.
The nine planes make up almost half the fleet of Laudamotion, the former Air Berlin subsidiary that used to be 
known as Niki.
Lufthansa, which had wanted to buy Niki from Air Berlin but withdrew from the bidding in December last year, said it 
could make good use of the planes in its own budget carrier, Eurowings.
Speaking to Austrian news agency APA, Laudamotion chief executive Andreas Gruber insisted it had paid all its 
bills related to the planes.
The payments for July had been met at the end of June, and all nine planes were in full use, Gruber said.
Dublin-based Ryanair accused Lufthansa of delaying payments of 1.5 million euros to Laudamotion, terming the 
cancellation of the leases as yet another attempt by Lufthansa "to destabilize and cause damage".
It also said Lufthansa had failed to make available all the planes promised. Lufthansa rejected this.
The European Commission gave the takeover the go-ahead without setting any conditions.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks rose on Friday and remained on track for a 
second week of gains as China refrained from detailing retaliation plans against the latest US tariffs.
Amid little economic news, traders looked forward to earnings results from US financial giants for direction.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.2% at 385.22 in late opening deals after climbing 0.8% on 
Thursday.
The German DAX and France's CAC 40 index were up around 0.3%, while the UK's FTSE 100 was gaining 0.6%.
The British pound drifted lower against its major opponents after a warning from US President Donald Trump that 
Prime Minister Theresa May's current 'soft-Brexit' proposal with the EU would probably "kill" any future trade deals 
with the US.
In an interview with The Sun, Trump said that PM's "soft Brexit" strategy would "affect trade with the US, 
unfortunately in a negative way."
"If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the EU instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the 
deal," Trump told the paper.
Ryanair Holdings rose about 1% after it received EU approval to buy a 75% interest in Austrian airline, 
Laudamotion, in which it already owns 24.9%.
Ashmore Group rallied 3.4%. The specialist Emerging Markets asset manager reported a drop in assets under 
management despite net inflows in its fourth quarter.
Recruitment firm Hays jumped more than 5% after its Group net fees for the fourth quarter increased 14% on a 
headline basis and 15% on a like-for-like basis against the prior year.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets got off to a positive start Friday, but 
pared their early gains over the course of the morning. 
The markets settled into a sideways patter in the afternoon and ended the session with small increases. 
Traders have been keeping a close eye on the UK as they host a visit from US President Trump.
The British pound weakened Friday, after Trump remarked that Prime Minister Theresa May's current 'soft-Brexit' 
proposal with the EU would probably "kill" any future trade deals with the US.
In an interview with The Sun, Trump said that PM's "soft Brexit" strategy would "affect trade with the US, 
unfortunately in a negative way."
"If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the EU instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the 
deal," Trump told the paper.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.17%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.26%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 0.21%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.38% and the CAC of France rose 0.43%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 0.14% 
and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.49%.
In London, Ryanair Holdings rose 0.38% after it received EU approval to buy a 75% interest in Austrian airline, 
Laudamotion, in which it already owns 24.9%.
Ashmore Group rallied 0.86%. The specialist Emerging Markets asset manager reported a drop in assets under 
management despite net inflows in its fourth quarter.
European Markets Cling To Small Gains After Early Strength Recedes
Recruitment firm Hays jumped 8.58% after its Group net fees for the fourth quarter increased 14% on a headline 
basis and 15% on a like-for-like basis against the prior year.
China's exports increased more-than-expected in June and its trade surplus with the US reached a record high in 
the midst of escalating trade disputes between the two countries.
Data from the General Administration of Customs showed that exports increased 11.3% year-on-year in June, 
bigger than the expected 9.5%, but slower than the 12.6% rise seen in May.
At the same time, annual growth in imports slowed to 14.1%. Economists had forecast a sharp growth of 21.3% 
after May's 26% increase.
Consequently, the overall trade surplus surged to USD41.61 billion in June from about USD24.9 billion in May. The 
surplus with the US came in at record USD28.97 billion, Reuters and Bloomberg reported, citing their own 
calculations.
Germany's wholesale price inflation accelerated further in June to the highest level in nine months, data from 
Destatis showed Friday. Wholesale prices climbed 3.4% year-on-year in June, faster than the 2.9% increase seen 
in May.
A report released by the Labor Department on Friday showed an unexpected decrease in US import prices in the 
month of June, although the report also showed a slightly bigger than expected increase in export prices during the 
month.
The Labor Department said import prices fell by 0.4% in June after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.9% in May.
The pullback surprised economists, who had expected import prices to inch up by 0.1% compared to the 0.6% 
increase originally reported for the previous month.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department also said export prices rose by 0.3% in June following a 0.6% increase in May. 
Economists had expected export prices to edge up by 0.2%.
Reflecting concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, the University of Michigan released a report on Friday 
showing an unexpected deterioration in US consumer sentiment in the month of July.
The preliminary report said the consumer sentiment index dipped to 97.1 in July from the final June reading of 98.2. 
Economists had expected the index to come in unchanged.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said European Union Commission has approved its 
proposed acquisition of a 75% interest in Austrian airline Laudamotion GmbH.
The company currently holds 25% interest in Laudamotion.
The budget airline said the majority of Laudamotion services take place in Austria, Germany and Spain, and offers 
competition, lower fares, and more choice for consumers in the region.
However, Laudamotion is currently under threat by Lufthansa which is attempting to remove the nine aircraft it was 
obliged by the European Commission to provide.
"We welcome the EU Commission's decision to approve Ryanair's proposed acquisition," said Juliusz Komorek, 
Ryanair's chief legal & regulatory officer. 
"Ryanair remains committed to bringing competition, choice and low fares to the Austrian, German and Spanish 
markets through our investment in Laudamotion," added Komorek.
Shares in Ryanair opened 1.2% higher on Friday at 15.78 pence each.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - EU competition authorities have given the go-ahead for Dublin-based Ryanair to take 
over Austrian budget carrier Laudamotion, the European Commission announced on Thursday.
The authorization was issued without any conditions, as there were no grounds for reservations on competition 
grounds, the commission said.
Ryanair, which operates throughout Europe, is to take a 75% stake in the Austrian carrier, which flies primarily from 
Germany, Austria and Switzerland to holiday destinations in the Mediterranean and Canaries.
Austrian entrepreneur and former Formula One racer Niki Lauda originally founded the airline under the name Niki 
in 2003 and sold it to the Air Berlin group in 2011. Following Air Berlin's bankruptcy last year, he bought it back in 
January and re-established it as Laudamotion with the help of British travel company Thomas Cook.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sees the investment as a way to expand business in the German-speaking 
market, which is dominated by Lufthansa.
Lufthansa earlier wanted to buy Niki from Air Berlin but withdrew in December last year.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is to cancel up to 30 flights between Ireland and the UK on 
Thursday over a planned strike by its pilots.
The budget airline said that all Ireland to Europe flights will operate as normal.
The cancellations follow a decision by Ryanair pilots to hold a strike earlier this month.
Members of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association at the budget airline voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial 
action.
The union says the Dublin-based carrier is not taking its demands seriously over pay and conditions, issues over 
seniority and how annual leave is dealt with.
Customers were notified of the cancellations by text and email on Tuesday and will also receive a refund.
The company said it will help customers travelling to the UK with alternative transport – both flights and ferries – 
where there is space available.
Management and unions are due to meet on Wednesday at Dublin Airport in a bid to minimise disruption.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stobart Group Ltd on Friday reported the departure of its Chief Financial Officer 
Richard Laycock and said it remains on track to deliver medium-term objectives.
At its annual general meeting on Friday, the infrastructure & support services company said Laycock will not be 
putting himself forward for election, but will continue "to support" the business.
Stobart has started a search to identify a suitable interim replacement for the role, it said.
Also, the company said it is doing well on growing London Southend airport in order to bring in 5 million passengers 
annually by 2022. Back in June, the company signed a five-year deal with low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC.
Under the contract, Ryanair agreed to invest USD300 million to open a new base at Southend airport with 
operations commencing in summer 2019.
In addition, the company aims to supply over 3 million tonnes of renewable energy fuel per annum by 2022. Stobart 
said its Energy division performed well as tonnages rose 54% year-on-year since March due to new contracts 
becoming operational.
Meanwhile, Stobart said its Infrastructure unit generated cash of GBP25.5 million in the year to-date from March. 
The result was achieved after the sale & leaseback of properties and land at its Widnes site north-west England.
"Since stepping into my role last year, we have made significant progress across our business divisions, and 
continue to focus on delivering on our ambition to double the value of the business by 2022," said Chief Executive 
Warwick Brady.
Shares in Stobart were trading 1.1% higher on Friday morning at 231.10 pence each.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - The European Commission said it has opened an in-depth investigation to assess 
whether marketing agreements concluded between the Association for the Promotion of Touristic and Economic 
Flows and Ryanair at the airport of Montpellier in France are in line with EU State aid rules.
Montpellier airport is a regional airport located in the French region of Occitanie. The airport is one of the twenty 
largest in France and served 1.9 million passengers in 2017.
The Commission received a complaint concerning marketing agreements between the Association for the 
Promotion of Touristic and Economic Flows and Ryanair and its subsidiary AMS. The complainant alleged that the 
agreements amounted to illegal State aid in favour of Ryanair.
Since 2010, the APFTE has concluded various agreements with Ryanair, under which Ryanair has received 
substantial payments in exchange for promoting Montpellier and the surrounding area as a touristic destination on 
its website. 
The APFTE is an independent association, unrelated to the airport operator, and is funded almost entirely by 
regional and local public entities. The Commission has therefore concluded on a preliminary basis that the 
agreements with Ryanair are financed through State resources and attributable to the State.
At this stage, the Commission has concerns that the terms of the agreements may give Ryanair an undue economic 
advantage vis-a-vis its competitors, because the conditions are too favourable and no private operator would have 
accepted to enter into similar arrangements with Ryanair to purchase marketing services.
The Commission will now investigate further to find out whether its initial concerns are confirmed.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC cabin staff have agreed to go on strike on July 25 and 26 in 
Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain, a consortium of trade unions announced on Thursday, following talks in 
Brussels.
Employees at Europe's largest budget airline have long demanded better pay and working conditions.
Trade unions from Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy convened Thursday's talks after Ryanair missed an end-of-
June deadline to apply national labour laws, enter into negotiations with them and apply the same conditions to all 
cabin crew, the unions said in a statement.
"Regretfully, Ryanair chose to continue to ignore its workforce and gave these unions no other choice but to call for 
a national 24 hours strike action," the statement said.
Ryanair cabin crews are due to strike in all four countries on July 25, with Italian staff resuming work on July 26 
while the Belgian, Spanish and Portuguese workforce continue their industrial action.
Unions in other European countries might also take action in the coming weeks, the statement said, noting that 
"legal restrictions and extensive bureaucratic procedures," were currently preventing them from doing so.
The statement calls on the European Commission and EU governments to act against Ryanair's labour practices, 
while urging the European Aviation Safety Agency and its national counterparts to be "more vigilant with Ryanair 
and make them abide by the law."
The statement was signed by the CNE and LBC unions in Belgium, SITCPLA and USO in Spain, the SNPVAC in 
Portugal and Italy's Uiltrasporti union.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are called for a slightly lower open on Thursday, with investors 
continuing to err on the side of caution as the US and China look set to proceed with reciprocal tariffs on Friday.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 5.69 points lower at 7,567.40 on Thursday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed down 0.3%, or 20.20 points, at 7,573.09 on Wednesday.
Markets are pointing to a "lower but uninspiring open" on Thursday, said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London 
Capital Group. Reciprocal tariffs from the US and China on the other's goods are due to come in on Friday.
"With the continued uncertainty as to what the actual next move will be, from either power, traders were opting to sit 
on the side lines," said Lawler.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said she will make "every effort" to avoid a trade war with the US and repeated her 
pledge to increase defence spending, addressing two major points of contention in the US-German relationship.
Speaking in the German parliament on Wednesday, Merkel said "it is worth making every effort to try to deescalate 
this conflict so that it does not become an all-out war ... Germany is definitely committed to it as is the entire EU."
But, speaking at an economics event organized by the Munich-based Ifo institute, EU commissioner Guenther 
Oettinger predicted: "There will be a trade war."
In the UK, Theresa May faced fresh warnings and pressure over the shape and content of the final Brexit deal as 
crunch cabinet talks at Chequers loom.
With little more than a day to go before senior ministers meet in Buckinghamshire to thrash out a white paper, 
ministers are said to be sceptical about the so-called "third way" to solve the customs issue on the Irish border.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Lower Open Seen With Friday's Tariffs Eyed
The proposed "facilitated customs arrangement" would see technology used to determine where goods arriving into 
the UK will ultimately end up. This would allow the correct tariff to be paid – either at the UK or EU rate.
According to the Financial Times, Brussels will express concern about the reliance of this plan on untested 
technology and will question how it is not "an open invitation to smugglers".
Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover warned that a "bad" deal on Brexit could cost it GBP1.2 billion every year. It follows 
similar warnings in recent weeks from Airbus and BMW who have voiced concerns about the impact of a no-deal 
Brexit on UK jobs and investment.
Elsewhere, the European Commission said it has opened an in-depth investigation to assess whether marketing 
agreements concluded between the Association for the Promotion of Touristic and Economic Flows and Ryanair at 
the airport of Montpellier in France are in line with EU State aid rules.
Montpellier airport is a regional airport located in the French region of Occitanie. The airport is one of the twenty 
largest in France and served 1.9 million passengers in 2017.
The Commission received a complaint concerning marketing agreements between the Association for the 
Promotion of Touristic and Economic Flows and Ryanair and its subsidiary AMS. The complainant alleged that the 
agreements amounted to illegal State aid in favour of Ryanair.
In Asia on Thursday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index is down 0.8%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 
0.9%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 1.2%.
Markets in the US were closed on Wednesday for the Independence Day holiday, and re-open on Thursday.
In Thursday's corporate calendar, Primark-owner Associated British Foods, electronic products distributor 
Electrocomponents, and housebuilders Bovis Homes and Persimmon all release trading updates. Fashion retailer 
Superdry and online estate agent Purplebricks release annual results.
In the economic calendar on Thursday, German factory orders are at 0700 BST, while in the US there is ADP 
employment change at 1315 BST followed by initial and continuing jobless claims at 1330 BST. The Markit 
composite PMI is at 1445 BST, with the ISM non-manufacturing PMI at 1500 BST.
In the central bank events calendar on Thursday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will speak at 1100 BST 
while in the US, the minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee will be released at 1900 BST.
"The June FOMC Minutes should shed some light on the Fed's level of conviction behind a fourth rate hike later this 
year. We will also watch for the Fed's assessment of various risks to the outlook, especially on the trade front, as 
well as officials' views on underlying inflation," said analysts at Societe Generale.

Traders were encouraged by the stronger than expected German factory orders data and easing trade concerns.
Automakers were among the top performing stocks amid reports that the Trump administration might suspend 
threats to impose tariffs on cars imported from the EU if the block lifted duties on US cars.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.41%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.84%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 0.31%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 1.19% and the CAC of France rose 0.86%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 0.40% 
and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.12%.
In Frankfurt, Daimler advanced 3.80%, BMW gained 3.60% and Volkswagen added 3.69%.
In Paris, Renault climbed 2.90% and Peugeot rose 3.54%.
Sodexo advanced 8.69%. The food services and facilities management group has maintained its full-year goals 
after posting Q3 sales that topped forecasts.
In London, fashion retailer SuperDry soared 6.59% after announcing a special dividend.
Primark-owner Associated British Foods sank 4.16% after it released a trading update for the 40 weeks to 23 June 
2018.
Ryanair Holdings dropped 2.44% after the European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into marketing 
agreements with regional and local authorities in France.
Insurance group Assicurazioni Generali climbed 1.86% in Milan after it entered into an agreement with Generali 
Deutschland to sell the 89.9% stake in Generali Leben to Viridium Gruppe.
European Markets Climb On Growing Strength Of Automakers
Germany's factory orders expanded for the first time in five months in May, largely on robust domestic demand. 
Factory orders grew 2.6% month-on-month in May, in contrast to a revised 1.6% drop in April, data from Destatis 
showed Thursday. Orders were expected to climb moderately by 1.1%.
Germany's construction sector growth remained robust in June, despite easing from the previous month, survey 
data from IHS Markit showed Thursday. The construction Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 53.0 in June 
from 53.9 in May. However, any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
Private sector employment in the US increased by less than expected in the month of June, according to a report 
released by payroll processor ADP on Thursday. ADP said private sector employment climbed by 177,000 jobs in 
June after jumping by an upwardly revised 189,000 jobs in May.
Economists had expected employment to rise by about 190,000 jobs compared to the addition of 178,000 jobs 
originally reported for the previous month.
A day ahead of the release of the more closely watched monthly jobs report, the Labor Department released a 
report on Thursday showing a modest uptick in first-time claims for US unemployment benefits in the week ended 
June 30th.
The report said initial jobless claims inched up to 231,000, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's revised 
level of 228,000. The modest increase came as a surprise to economists, who had expected jobless claims to edge 
down to 225,000 from the 227,000 originally reported for the previous week.
A report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday showed growth in activity in the US service 
sector unexpectedly accelerated in the month of June.
The ISM said its non-manufacturing index rose to 59.1 in June after climbing to 58.6 in May, with a reading above 
50 indicating growth in the service sector. Economists had expected the index to edged down to 58.3.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - Ryanair staff have agreed to go on strike on July 25 and 26 in Belgium, Italy, 
Portugal and Spain, the CNE trade union told dpa on Thursday, confirming Belgian media reports.
Employees at Europe's largest budget airline have long demanded better pay and working conditions.
Trade unions had convened Thursday's talks in Brussels following an end-of-June ultimatum for Ryanair to accept 
local regulations, as other airlines do, according to the CNE, one of Belgium's largest trade unions.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC pilots have voted to back strike action in their dispute over terms 
and conditions.
Members of the Irish airline pilots' association at the budget airline voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial 
action.
The strike is planned for Thursday next week, for 24 hours.
The union says the Dublin-based carrier is not taking its demands seriously over pay and conditions, issues over 
seniority and how annual leave is dealt with.
The outcome of the ballot could leave holidaymakers facing disruption over the busy summer period.
It came hours after the airline revealed another month of travel misery as air traffic control strikes left more than 
210,000 passengers with cancelled flights in June.
It said more than 1,100 flights were axed for the second month running due to air traffic control strikes over four 
weekends in June, as well as staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France.
A spokesman for the Irish airline pilots' association said: "Our member pilots directly employed by Ryanair complain 
that there is no transparent system for the determination of important matters including voluntary/involuntary base 
transfer/allocation, command upgrade, allocation of annual leave and promotion.
"When a pilot receives notice of a mandatory base change, or is denied a request for a change of base, such 
management decisions can have a devastating effect on family life."
The union said it remained available and willing to engage on the issues identified in the notice of strike action.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC both reported 
increased passenger numbers for the month of June.
In June, Ryanair said traffic grew by 7% to 12.6 million customers from 11.8 million a year ago, while rolling annual 
traffic to June grew 7% to 132.9 million customers.
Load factor remained the same at 96%, on the back of lower fares, the company said.
The Irish low-cost airline said that Air Traffic Control (ATC) strikes and staff shortage affected flights causing over 
1,100 cancellations for the month of June. In the same month a year ago, only 41 flights were cancelled.
The cancellations affected over 210,000 passengers. 
"Ryanair calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European governments to ameliorate the effect of ATC 
strikes and staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France from disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe's 
consumers this summer," Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said.
Ryanair shares closed at EUR15.56 each on Monday.
In a separate announcement, eastern-Europe focused carrier Wizz Air said its passenger numbers for the month of 
June increased 22% to 3.0 million from 2.5 million in the same month a year ago.
Rolling annual traffic to June increased 23% to 31.0 million from 25.2 million year-on-year.
Load factor increased to 93% from 92% year-on-year.
Wizz Air shares closed at 3,491.00 pence on Monday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in International Consolidated Airlines fell on Tuesday after the UK government 
won a vote on controversial plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport late Monday.
Support from Labour MPs helped push through the proposals to expand Europe's busiest airport with an 
overwhelming Commons majority of 296.
British Airways parent IAG was 1.3% lower at 688.60 pence on Tuesday, making it the second worst performer in 
the FTSE 100.
British Airways' main base is at London's Heathrow airport. IAG has previously spoken out against expansion at 
Heathrow, with Chief Executive Willie Walsh in May saying: "A three runway Heathrow will be the most expensive 
hub airport in the world and the UK economy and consumers will suffer at the hands of a rapacious landlord."
Michael van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said a third runway will mean more competition for IAG, 
both short haul and long haul.
"The green light is logically aimed at relieving pressure on an airport which has continued to grow over the years. 
The flip side for IAG, however, is that expansion may end up putting pressure on both IAG and peers - typically flag 
carriers, which have benefited from being able to charge a premium for using Heathrow - as new capacity makes 
each slot less valuable and more economically viable," said van Dulken.
"Unless, of course, there is so much competition that the new capacity is hoovered up at current prices, perhaps 
even at a premium, keeping the budget players away. In the meantime though, might the airlines even have to pay 
a bit more for slots to help fund some of the GBP14 billion project? They've already complained of higher charges 
to fund Terminal 2 and 5," the Accendo analyst continued.
Shares in budget carriers easyJet and Ryanair also were lower in London Tuesday, though but less. easyJet was 
down 0.4% and Ryanair by 0.6%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish stockbroker Davy has reiterated its preference for low-cost carriers in the 
European airline industry - in particular, Ryanair and Wizz Air.
Entering the peak summer period, Davy has added Ryanair to its Conviction List, with an unchanged price target of 
EUR18 and Outperform rating , and upgraded Wizz Air to "outperform".
Davy has retained its "outperform" rating for Ryanair due to it remaining the "market leader in the European low-
cost airline market". Its balance sheet is "pristine", said Davy analysts.  
Ryanair's "strong cash flows support capital expenditure requirements and provide the potential for significant share 
buybacks/special dividends".
The casualty of Ryanair's addition: EasyJet. The British airline has been downgraded to a "neutral" rating and fallen 
off of Davy's Conviction List. 
Davy analysts said: "EasyJet is up 30% since inclusion in our Conviction List and 23% year-to-date and is 
approaching our 1850 price target."
Wizz Air has been upgraded to "outperform" - with a revised price target of GBP42.0, up from GBP34.0 - due to its 
"scope for 15% capacity and earnings growth over the next decade". Davy "takes comfort" from the Hungarian 
airline's "efforts to scale the business proactively".
Taking a broader view at the industry, Davy analysts said: "Our latest capacity analysis suggests a broadly flat out-
turn in the fourth quarter for the first time since the first quarter of 2013. The big topic in the space currently is the 
industry's elasticity of supply to a change in the oil price, this is clearly an encouraging sign.
"It should also support pricing at the airlines under coverage and therefore valuation multiples. A rising oil price will 
also speed up the pace of consolidation in Europe. The airline profit pool within Europe is shared among a select 
few and there is scope for these operators to improve competitive positioning and market share."

Shares in Ryanair were up 2.3% Wednesday at EUR16.38 each. 
Wizz Air shares were trading up 2.9% at 3,763.00p each and easyJet shares were up 1.8% at 1,801.00p each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London share prices were higher at midday on Wednesday, with the FTSE 100 
supported by weakness in the pound, which slipped following uninspiring UK inflation data.
The FTSE 100 index was up 0.4%, or 28.63 points, at 7,732.44 at midday. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was up 
0.2% at 21,291.95. The AIM All-Share index was flat at 1.101.55.
The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.3% at 13,112.24, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.3% at 19,468.81, and the Cboe UK Small 
Companies was down 0.2% at 12,907.68.
"The pound continued to stumble over every obstacle placed in its way this week, the currency falling following a 
disappointing - if expected - inflation reading," said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
On the London Stock Exchange, Glencore was among the best blue-chip performers, up 2.7% after the miner and 
commodities trader reached a settlement with the Democratic Republic of the Congo's state mining company.
The Switzerland-headquartered miner said its subsidiary Katanga Mining has agreed with Gecamines a number of 
remedies which will see the latter drop all legal proceedings. Gecamine had been seeking either a wind-up of the 
Kamoto Copper Co joint venture, held 75% by Katanga and the rest by Gecamines, due to the partnership's capital 
issues. 
To remedy this, Katanga and Gecamines have agreed USD5.60 billion out of Kamoto's USD9 billion debt will be 
converted into equity. Further, Kamoto will waive its entitlement to replacement reserves and incurred drilling costs 
on Gecamines' behalf, amounting to a total of USD342 million.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: FTSE Boosted After UK Inflation Data Disappoints
At the other end of the large cap index, online takeaway platform Just Eat was the worst performer, down 10%, 
amid UK expansion plans by rival Deliveroo. 
The Guardian newspaper reported late Tuesday that Deliveroo intends to sign up 5,000 more UK eateries. 
Just Eat recently said it was planning to launch its own delivery fleet in the UK, Canada, Australia and New 
Zealand, competing with Deliveroo. Until now, Just Eat has relied on restaurants to make their own deliveries, 
whereas Deliveroo is know for its ubiquitous bicycle couriers.
Deliveroo fired back with its own UK expansion plans expecting to add 5,000 UK eateries to its network as well as 
employ "thousands" of more couriers to its existing team of 15,000 riders.
In addition, Deliveroo plans to offer restaurants with their own delivery the option of using Deliveroo's couriers at 
busy times. As such, Deliveroo's new service would enable users to choose from 50% more restaurants, The 
Guardian noted.
In the FTSE 250, Stobart Group was the best performer at midday up 8.3% after Irish budge airline Ryanair 
Holdings said it will open a new base at London Southend Airport from April next year to deliver one million guests 
annually. 
Ryanair inked a five-year deal with the midcap support services firm - which owns the airport in Essex, east of 
London. The contract can be extended to ten years.
The airline plans to invest USD300 million into three aircraft based at London Southend Airport and introduce 13 
new routes to eight European countries. Ryanair shares were up 0.3%.
TalkTalk Telecom Group shares were up 7.5% after Merrill Lynch double upgraded the home phone and internet 
services provider to Buy from Underperform. 
At the other end of the midcaps, Dixons Carphone was down 3.9% after the mobile phone and electrical goods 
retailer admitted to a data breach of its payment processing systems.
Dixons Carphone said it added extra security measures and engaged with cyber security experts after hackers 
attempted to gain unauthorised access to its systems and data.
The company said there was an attempt to compromise 5.9 million bank cards in one of the processing systems of 
its Currys PC World and Dixons Travel stores. As a result, the company said about 105,000 non-EU issued 
payment cards which do not have chip and pin protection have been compromised. Dixons currently has no 
evidence that any fraudulent activity took place, but it informed the relevant authority about the incident.
In addition, 1.2 million records containing non-financial personal data, such as names, residential addresses and 
email address, were accessed. 
The pound was marginally lower against the dollar at USD1.3340 compared to USD1.3354 at the London equities 
close Tuesday, following lacklustre UK inflation data.
UK inflation remained stable in May, the Office for National Statistics reported.
Consumer price inflation held steady at 2.4%, the lowest since March 2017, and in line with expectations. Month-
on-month, consumer prices gained 0.4% in May, matching economists' expectations.
Core inflation excluding energy, food, alcoholic beverages and tobacco also remained stable in May, at 2.1%.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: FTSE Boosted After UK Inflation Data Disappoints
At the same time, output price inflation climbed to 2.9% annually, as expected, from 2.5%. Month-on-month, prices 
registered a steady increase of 0.4%, while economists had forecast a 0.3% rise.
"[Bank of England] Governor Mark Carney will remain hopeful that inflation will return to target without the need for 
any further tightening of policy and with the inflationary pressures of the sterling's post-Brexit vote drop still 
expected to decline in the coming months the bank may well stand pat for the foreseeable future," said XTB chief 
market analyst David Cheetham.
In addition, UK house price inflation eased further in April to the lowest level in just over a year, figures from the 
Office for National Statistics showed.
The house price index climbed 3.9% year-over-year in April, slower than March's 4.2% rise. The average UK house 
price was GBP227,000 in April, which was GBP9,000 higher than in the same month of the prior year and 
GBP3,000 lower than a month ago.
On a regional basis, London remained the region with the highest average house price at GBP485,000, followed by 
the South East and the East of England.
In Paris the CAC 40 was up 0.3%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.2%. 
The euro was a touch lower against the dollar at USD1.1762 compared to USD1.1783 at the European equities 
close Tuesday.
In economic news, eurozone industrial production fell more sharply than expected in April at 1.7% compared to 
3.0% in March, on an annual basis. Economists had expected the figure to come in at 2.8%. 
Stocks in New York are set to open higher ahead of the interest rate decision from the US Federal Reserve at 1900 
BST followed by a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points as its two-day policy meeting draws to a close. 
With the hike, the federal funds rate is expected to be in a range of 1.75% to 2.0%.
"Markets have almost fully priced in a rate hike today which, assuming the central bank does as expected, should 
draw attention instead to the new economic projections. The central bank has previously indicated that three rate 
hikes this year is likely but with the inflation picking up, the economy performing well and tax reforms having added 
an additional stimulus this year, a fourth could be on the cards," said Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam.
The DJIA was called up 0.1%, the S&P 500 index up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.2%.
Still to come in the economic events calendar are US producer prices at 1330 BST and EIA crude oil stocks at 1530 
BST.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC late Monday said it has signed the second 
cabin crew union recognition agreement with Unite the Union, who will be the representative body for Ryanair 
directly employed cabin crew in the UK.
"We are pleased to sign this cabin crew recognition agreement with Unite the Union in the UK," said Chief People 
Officer Eddie Wilson. "We hope to announce further agreements over the coming weeks, in those countries where 
unions have approached these negotiations in a practical and positive manner."
The agreement follows Ryanair's December announcement that it was willing to recognise unions for collective 
bargaining purposes. The UK currently accounts for 25% of Ryanair's fleet. 
The company has signed a similar union recognition agreement with the British Airline Pilots Association, which will 
be the sole representative body for the company's UK pilots.
"As this growing number of pilot and cabin crew recognition agreements confirms, we are making progress and 
confounding those sceptics who claimed that our December 2017 decision was not real or genuine," Wilson 
continued. "We look forward to working closely with both Unite the Union, and their company council to address 
issues of concern to our UK based cabin crew." 
Shares in Ryanair closed up 0.4% at EUR16.12 on Monday.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - Markets in Europe got off to a positive start Thursday, but 
quickly gave back their early gains before settling into a sideways pattern. The markets ended the session with 
mixed results, but remained little changed overall.
Bank stocks performed well on reports that the European Central Bank will discuss winding down their bond-buying 
program when it meets next week.
The opening of the London Stock Exchange was delayed by an hour Thursday due to a technical glitch.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.16%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 0.03%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.14%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 0.15% and the CAC of France fell 0.17%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 0.10%, 
but the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.04%.
In Paris, Rémy Cointreau sank 4.78% after posting disappointing annual results.
In London, J Sainsbury decreased 0.78% after going ex-dividend.
Ryanair fell 2.30% after Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the stock to "Hold" from "Buy."
Drug-maker Lundbeck dropped 0.98% in Copenhagen after it agreed to settle a US probe into its financial support 
of patient assistance charitable foundations.
The euro area economy expanded as initially estimated in the first quarter, the latest estimate from Eurostat 
showed Thursday. Gross domestic product grew 0.4% sequentially in the first quarter, slower than the 0.7% 
expansion seen a quarter ago. The rate came in line with the estimate released on May 15.
European Markets Finish Mixed After Giving Back Early Gains
Germany's factory orders declined unexpectedly in April on weak domestic demand, figures from Destatis revealed 
Thursday.
Factory orders slid 2.5% month-on-month in April, bigger than the revised 1.1% decrease seen in March and 
confounded expectations for an increase of 0.8%. This was the fourth consecutive decline in orders.
France's trade deficit remained stable in April, as the increase in exports was offset by that of imports, figures from 
the Customs Office showed Thursday. The trade deficit came at EUR 5.0 billion in April, unchanged from March. 
The expected shortfall was EUR 5.1 billion.
UK house prices rebounded at a faster than expected pace in May, data from the Lloyds bank subsidiary Halifax 
and IHS Markit showed Thursday. House prices grew 1.5% month-on-month, reversing a 3.1% fall in April. Prices 
were forecast to rise 1% in May.
First-time claims for US unemployment benefits saw a modest decrease in the week ended June 2nd, according to 
a report released by the Labor Department on Thursday. The Labor Department said initial jobless claims edged 
down to 222,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's revised level of 223,000.
Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 225,000 from the 221,000 originally reported for the previous 
week.

"We are delighted to be welcoming someone of Sean's calibre to Origin Enterprises as we prepare for our next 
phase of growth," said Origin Chairman Rose Hynes. 
The stock was trading 5.2% higher at 5.69 pence per share on Thursday. UDG shares were down 1.0% at 885.00p.
UDG had issued no statement about the Coyle mid-morning Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) -  Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has signed a cabin 
crew union recognition agreement with ANPAC and ANPAV, who will be the representative body for Ryanair 
directly employed cabin crew in Italy. 
"This is our first cabin crew union recognition agreement (which follows recognition agreements with pilot unions in 
the UK and Italy earlier this year) and further demonstrates Ryanair's progress on recognising and negotiating with 
unions across Europe for our people. We are making good progress with other cabin crew unions across Europe 
and we hope to sign more recognition agreements with both pilot and cabin crew unions in the coming weeks," 
Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said.
The agreement follows Ryanair's December announcement that it was willing to recognise unions for collective 
bargaining purposes. Italy currently accounts for over 80 of Ryanair's 400 plus aircraft fleet and 20% of Ryanair's 
cabin crew. 
In March, Ryanair signed a union recognition agreement with ANPAC, the Italian Airline Pilots Association, which 
will be the sole representative body for Ryanair pilots in Italy. 
The company has signed a similar union recognition agreement with the British Airline Pilots Association, which will 
be the sole representative body for the company's UK pilots. 
Shares in Ryanair were broadly flat at EUR16.70 on Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Air traffic control strikes pose more of a threat to European airlines than a rise in fuel 
prices according to the Chief Executive of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA Willie Walsh, Reuters 
reported on Tuesday.
Moreover, Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was forced to cancel flights in May due to air traffic control strikes. 
The company noted ATC strikes and staff shortages caused the cancellation of over 1,100 flights in May compared 
to 43 in the same period last year.
"Regrettably over 200,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in May because of ATC strikes (mostly 
French), ATC staff shortages and thunderstorms. Ryanair calls for immediate EU Commission action to prevent 
more ATC strikes and staff shortages disrupting the travel plans of Europe's consumers this summer," said Ryanair 
Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs on Tuesday.
IAG shares were down 2.4% and peer easyJet PLC shares were down 1.6% on Tuesday, with Ryanair shares up 
0.4% at EUR16.87.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
The UK government completed its sale of a 7.7% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland Group, at a more than GBP2 
billion loss to the UK taxpayer. The Treasury sold the 925.0 million RBS shares in an accelerated bookbuild 
announced after the London market close on Monday, raising GBP2.51 billion cutting its holding in the FTSE 100-
listed bank to 62%. The shares were sold at a price of 271 pence each, a 3.6% discount to the 281.18 pence 
closing price on Monday. The government had paid an average of 502p per share during its bailout of RBS during 
the financial crisis of 2008.
----------
UK Culture Secretary Matt Hancock will deliver his verdict on Twenty-First Century Fox's GBP11.7 billion takeover 
of Sky on Tuesday. He will make a statement to Parliament on whether the UK government will block the merger, 
wave it through or permit it subject to certain conditions. Rupert Murdoch's Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky 
it does not already own, but the bid has been complicated by competition concerns and a rival offer by US cable-
television firm Comcast.
----------
Ryanair Holdings said in the month of May it recorded an increase in customers and an increased load factor due to 
lower fares. In May 2018, Ryanair saw its customer numbers grow 6% to 12.5 million from 11.8 million in May 2017. 
Load factor, a measure of capacity utilization, increased one percentage point to 96% in May 2018 from 95% in 
May 2017. "Regrettably over 200,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in May because of ATC strikes 
(mostly French), ATC staff shortages and thunderstorms. Ryanair calls for immediate EU Commission action to 
prevent more ATC strikes and staff shortages disrupting the travel plans of Europe's consumers this summer," said 
Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs.

MARKETS
----------
London shares were mixed with RBS among the blue chip fallers, down 3.5%. The pound was firm against the 
dollar after solid services figures from the UK. Wall Street was pointed to a higher open with major stock indices 
pointed to 0.2% to 0.3%. 
----------
FTSE 100: down 0.6% at 7,697.75

(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
British service sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in three months in May, survey data from IHS Markit 
showed. The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index, rose to 54.0 in 
May from 52.8 in April. The index was forecast to increase to 53.0. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the 
sector. However, new business volumes continued to rise at a relatively subdued pace in May.
----------
UK car demand increased in May as market continued to re-balance following large declines in 2017, the Society of 
Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. Car sales grew 3.4% year-on-year to 192,649 units in May.
----------
Like-for-like sales in the UK were up 2.8% on year in May, the British Retail Consortium said. That beat 
expectations for an increase of 1% following the 4.2% contraction in April. In the three months to May, food sales 
added 2.0% and non-food sales fell 4.1% on a like-for-like basis. Total sales climbed 4.1% on year in May. "The FA 
Cup Final and Royal Wedding may have got the nation in the mood for celebration but the day itself was a 
distraction for shoppers as they stayed at home to watch the festivities," BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
----------
Campaigners have reacted with concern to reports the UK government will give the go-ahead for a third runway at 
Heathrow on Tuesday. The divisive issue is said to be on the agenda when the prime minister chairs a meeting of 
ministers on the Cabinet's economic sub-committee on Tuesday morning. The committee is expected to sign off the 
Airports National Policy Statement before putting it before the full Cabinet for approval, BBC News reports. 
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is likely to then make a statement to MPs, who are expected to be given a vote 
on the NPS in the coming weeks.
----------
Business leaders were told plans for future trade relations with the EU will be set out in greater detail "shortly" in a 
meeting with Theresa May. The promised document may not be published before the June summit of EU leaders 
and concerns have been raised about the progress being made on Brexit. But No 10 insisted company chiefs 
"expressed their support" for the approach set out by the prime minister at the talks in No 10. Bosses from firms 
including BAE Systems, GlaxoSmithKline and Tesco were at the business advisory council meeting, along with the 
heads of organisations including the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors. A Downing 
Street spokesman said: "The prime minister provided an update on the negotiations with the EU alongside the 
Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, setting out plans to provide greater detail of the Future Relationship in a White 
Paper due to be published shortly."
----------
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Sells Down RBS Stake, Set To Rule On Sky Takeover
China's private sector expanded at a steady pace in May amid broad-based upturn in both manufacturing and 
services, data from IHS Markit showed. Nonetheless, growth remained slower than that seen at the start of 2018. 
The Caixin composite output index remained unchanged at 52.3 in May, signalling a steady and moderate pace of 
expansion. The services Purchasing Managers' Index also remained stable in May, at 52.9. A score above 50 
indicates expansion in the sector. Both manufacturers and services companies reported increases in output during 
May.
----------
The Singapore summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is starting to 
take shape, with the doubts over whether the meeting will actually take place apparently dispelled once and for all. 
A week before before the historic head-to-head, US allies are reacting with caution and scepticism. This weekend 
South Korea expressed optimism, while Japan cautioned against making hasty concessions to the North. Following 
talks with North Korean negotiator Kim Yong Chol at the White House, Trump stated on Friday that the summit 
would go ahead in Singapore as planned on Tuesday June 12, with the key issue being nuclear disarmament on 
the Korean peninsula.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are set to open lower on Tuesday, ahead of the UK services PMI 
reading at 0930 BST, after the UK government successfully sold part of its holding in Royal Bank of Scotland 
Group, though at a discount.
Meanwhile, airline Ryanair reported an increase in passenger traffic in May, retailer AO World suffered a widened 
loss for its recently ended financial year, despite growth in revenue, and St Modwen Properties reported a good 
start to its financial year.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 19.39 points lower at 7,721.90 on Tuesday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed up 0.5% at 7,741.29 on Monday.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3317 early Tuesday ahead of the PMI reading, lower than USD1.3325 at the London 
equities close on Monday.
Tuesday's service sector indicator follows a reading on the construction industry on Monday.
UK construction activity logged a moderate growth in May with the pace of expansion matching that seen in April, 
survey data from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply had showed Monday.
The construction Purchasing Managers' Index held steady at 52.5 in May. A score above 50 indicates expansion. 
Economists had forecast the index to drop to 51.8.
"Whilst both the manufacturing and the construction PMI headline figures have been better than expected, 
scratching beneath the surface of both data sets painted a less rosy picture. Today is the turn of the service sector. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Lower Call As UK Government Sells RBS Stake
Investors will want to see signs that the service sector continued to rebound in May after harsh weather kept 
consumers inside earlier in the year. If the BRC retail sales figures and the Barclaycard figures are anything to go 
by then we could be in for a bumper month," says Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital.
Like-for-like sales in the UK were up 2.8% on year in May, the British Retail Consortium said on Tuesday. That beat 
expectations for an increase of 1% following the 4.2% contraction in April.
In the three months to May, food sales added 2.0% and non-food sales fell 4.1% on a like-for-like basis. Total sales 
climbed 4.1% on year in May.
The UK government sold 925.0 million shares in RBS through an accelerated bookbuild at a price of 271.0 pence 
per share, a discount of 3.6% from the closing price on Monday of 281.18p, bring proceeds from the sale of 
GBP2.51 billion.
The sale of the 7.7% stake reduces the government's holding in RBS from 70.1% to 62.4%.
"With the decision to press ahead with the sale likely to provoke the usual partisan political background noise those 
who oppose the sale really need to ask themselves what they hope to achieve by insisting the government holds on 
to a stake that is highly unlikely to see the tax payer ever get its money back," says Michael Hewson, chief market 
analyst at CMC Markets.
FTSE 250-listed housebuilder St Modwen Properties reported a strong start to 2018. St Modwen Homes sales 
volumes for the period to the end of May rose by 31% from the same period the year before. However, it expects 
the division's sales growth to slow to 25% in the full financial year ending November 30.
St Modwen said that its expectations for its full-year performance remain unchanged.
Low cost airline Ryanair reported that for May, traffic increased by 6.0% on a year-on-year basis, with customers 
rising to 12.5 million from 11.8 million, and the load factor increasing by a percentage point to 96% from 95%.
This was in spite of ATC strikes during the month, which led to the cancellation of around 1,100 flights in May 
compared to 43 in the same month the year before, Ryanair said.
Electrical retailer AO World reported a widened pretax loss for the end of March at GBP13.5 million from GBP7.0 
million the year before, due to substantially higher costs of sales at GBP655.0 million from GBP572.0 million.
This was despite double-digit revenue growth of 14% at GBP796.8 million from GBP701.2 million the prior year, 
with higher sales in the UK and Europe despite weaker market conditions. 
Berenberg lowered its rating for FTSE 100-listed advertising firm WPP to Sell from Hold, and the price target was 
lowered to 1,075 pence from 1,275p.
The international economic events calendar on Tuesday has services PMI readings from Italy, France, Germany 
and the eurozone at 0845 BST, 0850 BST, 0855 BST and 0900 BST respectively. There are also eurozone retail 
sales figures at 1000 BST and South Africa first-quarter GDP data at 1030 BST.
Bank of England policymaker Jon Cunliffe will speak at the Futures Industry Association International Derivatives 
Expo in London at 1100 BST. 
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 0.7%, the S&P 
500 up 0.5% and Nasdaq Composite closing 0.7% higher.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Lower Call As UK Government Sells RBS Stake
In Asia on Tuesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.4%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.4%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC reported Monday that revenue in its recent financial year 
increased on the back of lower fares and traffic growth, despite September's "rostering management failure".
The Irish budget airline's revenue reached EUR7.15 billion, a 7.7% increase year-on-year from EUR6.64 billion in 
2017.
For the financial year that ended in March, Ryanair said pretax profit rose 10% to EUR1.61 billion, up from EUR1.47 
billion the prior year. The company said this was due to lower fares increasing passenger traffic by 9%.
In the past year, Ryanair lowered fares by 3% with the average flight cost at EUR39.4, it said. 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary confidently declared that "no other EU airline can compete with Ryanair 
prices". 
"Average fares last year declined by 3%, which was good news for our guests but bad news for competitors," he 
added.
Germany, Italy and Spain were the airline's largest growth markets, and the company said it expects "above 
average EU capacity" to continue in the new year.
To continue on the tide of positive results and increased passenger numbers, the budget airline announced the 
opening of over 200 new routes over the coming summer, including to Jordan, Turkey and Ukraine.
However, Ryanair said it expects prices to be pressured by higher oil prices, with fuel costs expected to add more 
than EUR400 million to the company's fuel bill in the current financial year.
For the past financial year, Ryanair's fuel bill amounted to EUR1.9 billion.
EXTRA: Ryanair Reports Profit Growth Amid Brexit Worry, Pilot Shortage
Last September, Ryanair was forced to cancel 20,000 flights after a rota mix-up led to pilot shortage, disrupting the 
travel plans of more than 700,000 passengers. 
The cancellations, and the subsequent EUR25 million spent under the EU261 compensation scheme, added to the 
airline ex-fuel unit costs, which increased 3% year-on-year.
"We expect the market for experienced pilots in Europe to remain tight for the next 12 months, and accordingly, this 
will continue to put upward pressure on staff costs for all EU airlines," Ryanair said.
However the budget airline said it reached agreements with pilot unions in the UK and Italy, and made progress in 
its negotiations with cabin crew. 
"Our combination of higher pay, improved rosters, and unmatched job security will, we believe, continue to make 
Ryanair an employer of choice in the EU airline sector," O'Leary said.
A hard Brexit remains a concern for the airline as its UK shareholders could be treated as non-EU, restricting 
Ryanair's licencing and flight rights.
Ryanair declared itself "on the pessimistic side of cautious" for 2019, with expected traffic growth of 7% and profit 
between EUR1.3 billion and EUR1.4 billion.
Ryanair shares were trading 2.2% higher at EUR15.84 on Monday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Davy maintained its Outperform rating on Ryanair after the low-cost airline released a 
strong set of annual results but looked to its year ahead "on the pessimistic side of cautious".
Shares in Ryanair were up 2.6% at EUR15.90 on Monday, having dipped as low as EUR15.20 in early trade.
Davy said Ryanair's net profit of EUR1.45 billion topped consensus of EUR1.44 billion, and the broker's own 
forecast of EUR1.42 billion. Pretax profit for the year came in at EUR1.61 billion, up 10% year-on-year, as revenue 
climbed 7.7% to EUR7.15 billion.
However, Davy said, the focus on Monday will lie on the airline's guidance.
The airline said its outlook for the year ahead is "on the pessimistic side of cautious". The company expects to grow 
traffic by 7% to 139 million, at a flat load factor of 95%. Unit costs in the current year will rise 9%, amid a continued 
shortage of pilots in Europe.
Net profit guidance of between EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion for the current year ending in 2019 is below 
consensus of EUR1.37 billion, Davy noted.
The broker maintained its 2019 net profit forecast for Ryanair of EUR1.31 billion, but lowered its 2020 forecast by 
5% to EUR1.35 billion.
"However, we view this as investing now for a 200 [million]-plus customer business and assume 'flat or slightly 
declining nonfuel unit costs' to resume thereafter. We believe Ryanair's industry-leading competitive advantage 
remains," Davy said.
While ancillary revenue growth is not expected to fully offset higher costs and lower fares, Davy said it should see 
growth at an "accelerated" rate per guest in the high single-digits.
IN THE KNOW: Davy Remains Bullish On Ryanair Despite Cautious Guidance
"Ryanair remains, and will continue to be, one of the largest, most efficient, European consumer growth plays. 
Despite the share volatility, we do not see the 14x multiple as expensive. We retain our 'Outperform' rating," said 
Davy.

British households' current financial pressures softened in May, helped by a combination of lower inflation and 
higher income from employment this spring, survey by IHS Markit and market research company Ipsos Mori 
revealed. The seasonally adjusted Household Finance Index, of HFI, rose to 44.7 in May from 43.4 in April. The 
figure signalled a softer budget squeeze, with the latest deterioration being the least marked since the end of 2016. 
However, any score below 50 suggests pessimism regarding finances among the UK households. The index 
reflecting households' financial expectations over the next year reached a 21-month high of 49.1 in May from 47.1 
in the previous month.

House prices in the UK were up 0.8% on month in May, property tracking website Rightmove said. That followed

previous month.

minister, League chief Matteo Salvini told journalists in Fiumicino on Sunday. "I'm not going to name names,"

to present their programme and the name of their prime minister to President Sergio Mattarella on Monday.

A top Trump administration official on Sunday took a step back from the threat of tariffs on Chinese products, with 
the US president's chief adviser saying they were still a possibility. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US 
is "putting the trade war on hold" and won't impose tariffs for now while it works on a framework for trade with 
China. Mnuchin, speaking on US broadcaster Fox News, made the comments a day after Chinese and US 
delegations cited progress on easing trade tensions. However, when asked whether the threat of tariffs against 
China was off the table, Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he didn't believe negotiations were "at that 
stage yet". Sunday's comments follow talks Thursday and Friday between US and Chinese negotiators in 
Washington that produced a joint statement saying China would begin buying more US goods and services.

Japan logged a trade surplus of JPY626.0 billion, about USD5.6 billion, in April, government data showed, boosted 
by strong demand for Japanese cars and manufacturing equipment overseas. Exports were up 7.8% to JPY6.822 
trillion, outpacing a 5.9% rise in imports to JPY6.196.3 trillion, according to a preliminary report by the Finance 
Ministry. By region, Japan saw its trade surplus against the US rising 4.7% to JPY615.7 billion thanks to a rise in 
car exports.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected on Monday to outline a new US strategy for dealing with Iran in his 
first major speech since becoming the top US diplomat last month. Pompeo will present a "diplomatic road map" for 
reaching a new nuclear deal with Iran in a speech at 9 am local time at the conservative Heritage Foundation in 
Washington. The new strategy will seek to create a framework that will address the totality of Iran's threats, a State 
Department official said last week. It comes two weeks after US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the 
US from the Iran nuclear deal announced in 2015 and reinstated economic sanctions against Tehran.
----------
Trump said he will demand the Department of Justice investigate whether the FBI or the department "infiltrated or 
surveilled" his presidential campaign for political purposes. The investigation should also look into whether any such 
requests were made by people in the administration of his predecessor, Barack Obama, Trump said on Twitter.
----------
The special counsel investigation into Trump allegedly obstructing an inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 
election will finish by September 1, his lawyer said late Sunday. Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian 
interference and possible links with Trump's campaign began in May last year after Trump fired FBI director James 
Comey, who at the time was examining Moscow's influence on the ballot. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the 
New York Times that Mueller's office had informed him the obstruction part of the investigation would conclude by 
September 1, though he added that the date depends on whether the president agrees to be interviewed. A 
spokesman for Mueller declined to respond to Giuliani's comment, which the Times said appeared to be an attempt 
to publicly pressure the special counsel amid negotiations about interviewing Trump.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The FTSE 100 is set to open at an all-time high on Monday, coming after trade tensions 
between the US and China eased over the weekend.
In early UK company news on Monday, AstraZeneca said the US Food & Drug Administration has approved 
Lokelma, NewRiver REIT confirmed it is in talks to buy Hawthorn Leisure Holdings, and Ryanair reported a strong 
rise in annual profit but was cautious on its outlook for the year ahead.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 41.01 points higher at 7,819.80 on Monday. The 
blue-chip index closed down 0.1%, or 9.18 points, at 7,778.79 on Friday. 
The index's current record intraday high stands at 7,792.56, a level which was reached in January of this year.
"The continued buoyancy in European markets is being helped in no small part by the weakness in both the euro 
and the pound against the US dollar, while concerns about an escalation in tensions between China and the US 
appear to have been deferred in the short term after progress in trade talks at the weekend," says CMC Markets 
chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
In early UK company news on Monday, drugmaker AstraZeneca said the US FDS has approved Lokelma, formerly 
ZS-9, for the treatment of adults with hyperkalaemia.
Hyperkalaemia is characterised by elevated potassium levels in the blood, associated with cardiovascular, renal 
and metabolic diseases. The FDA approval is supported by data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials 
and two open-label trials.

"We are pleased by today's FDA approval of Lokelma as it enables us to help address a long-standing clinical need 
with a new medicine that offers rapid and sustained treatment for adults with hyperkalaemia," said Sean Bohen, 
executive vice president, global medicines development and chief medical officer at AstraZeneca.
Seperately, the blue-chip pharmaceutical firm said it has submitted a supplemental new drug application to Japan's 
Pharmaceuticals & Medical Devices Agency for the use of Forxiga - a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 
inhibitor - as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with type-1 diabetes.
Forxiga is also under regulatory review in Europe.
Noting press reports, FTSE 250-listed NewRiver REIT confirmed it has entered a period of exclusivity with pub 
company Hawthorn Leisure Holdings and its major shareholder regarding a potential acquisition of the business. 
"A transaction, if completed, would be funded from NewRiver's existing resources. There can be no certainty that a 
transaction will be concluded and a further announcement, as appropriate, will be made as soon as practicable," 
NewRiver said.
Online gaming firm Playtech said it has received formal consent from the Italian gaming regulatory authority, 
Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli, for its purchase of a 70.6% stake in Snaitech.
The deal, first announced in April, will see Playtech subsequently make a mandatory takeover offer for the 
remaining shares in Snaitech after buying its 70.6% stake.
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported a 10% increase in annual profit after tax to EUR1.45 billion, saying that 
lower fares - which were down 3% - stimulated 9% traffic growth to over 130 million passengers. 
Full year 2018 total operating revenue from continuing operations rose 8% year-over-year to EUR7.15 billion. 
Traffic grew 9% with Germany, Italy and Spain being the company's largest growth markets.
However, the airline said its outlook for the year ahead is "on the pessimistic side of cautious". The company 
expects to grow traffic by 7% to 139 million, at flat load factors of 95%. Unit costs in the current year will rise 9%.
In addition, Ryanair said it has "limited" first half and "zero" second half fare visibility, with forward booking strong 
but pricing soft.
"Since only half of Easter fell in April, we expect a 5% fare decline in Q1 but a 4% rise in Q2 fares. While still too 
early to accurately forecast close-in summer bookings or H2 fares, we are cautiously guiding broadly flat average 
fares for FY19," Ryanair said.
Elsewhere on the Main Market, 4D Pharma said the UK Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has 
cleared a Clinical Trial Application for MRx0518, a live biotherapeutic cancer treatment. 
Enrolment in the Phase 1b study is expected to commence in the second half of 2018, 4D said.
"This groundbreaking study is set to be the world's first live biotherapeutic clinical trial in oncology and the first of a 
number of studies we have planned to investigate MRx0518 in multiple cancer settings," said Chief Executive 
Duncan Peyton
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended mostly lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending flat, the S&P 
500 down 0.3% and Nasdaq Composite closing 0.4% lower.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu, who travelled to the US on Tuesday for negotiations, told Chinese news outlet Xinhua 
that both countries had agreed to "not to engage in a trade war" and "stop slapping tariffs against each other".
He said that both countries had pledged to cooperate further in a "win-win choice" that would promote the "high-
quality development of the Chinese economy".
Liu's comments follow a joint statement released by the White House Saturday that China would begin buying more 
US goods and services to reduce the US trade deficit and meet Chinese consumption needs.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said the US is "putting the trade war on hold" and won't impose 
tariffs for now while it works on a framework for trade with China. 
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.8%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.9%.
Released early Monday, Japan's trade surplus for April came in at JPY626.0 billion, or around USD5.6 billion, 
boosted by strong demand for Japanese cars and manufacturing equipment overseas.
Exports were up 7.8% to JPY6.822 trillion, outpacing a 5.9% rise in imports to JPY6.196 trillion, according to a 
preliminary report by the Finance Ministry. By region, Japan saw its trade surplus against the US rising 4.7% to 
JPY615.7 billion thanks to a rise in car exports.
In the UK on Monday, Rightmove said house prices were up 0.8% on month in May, which follows a 0.4% rise in 
April. On a yearly basis, house prices advanced 1.1%, slowing from 1.6% in the previous month.
Meanwhile, a survey by IHS Markit and Ipsos Mori showed British households' current financial pressures softened 
in May, helped by a combination of lower inflation and higher income from employment this spring.
The seasonally adjusted Household Finance Index, or HFI, rose to 44.7 in May from 43.4 in April. The figure 
signaled a softer budget squeeze, with the latest deterioration being the least marked since the end of 2016. 
However, any score below 50 suggests pessimism regarding finances among the UK households.
"Following the accurate prediction by the majority of households of no base rate change in May, the forecast has 
since remained broadly unchanged," Sam Teague, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
"Over half of all households are expecting a rate hike over the course of 2018, though only one-in four expect to 
see rates rise by August."
To come in a thin economic events calendar on Monday there is the Chicago Fed National Activity Index at 1330 
BST. Markets in Germany and Switzerland are closed for the Whit Monday holiday on Monday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Monday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Marks & Spencer, up 2.3%. Shares in the food, clothing and homewares retailer were higher ahead of its annual 
results on Wednesday. M&S said on Monday it appointed Katie Bickerstaffe and Pip McCrostie in the role of non-
executive directors. The two will be formally appointed to the board following the company's annual general meeting 
on July 10. Bickerstaffe has experience in retail transformation, having worked in a variety of functions in leading 
UK retailers, M&S said, and will help in the first phase of its transformation programme. McCrostie, who worked in 
finance for accountants Ernst & Young, will bring financial and analytical skills, it said.
----------
AstraZeneca, up 2.0%. The pharmaceutical company said the US Food & Drug Administration approved its 
hyperkalaemia drug Lokelma. Lokelma, formerly known as ZS-9, is used to treat adults with hyperkalaemia, a 
condition characterised by elevated potassium levels in the blood, associated with cardiovascular, renal and 
metabolic diseases. The FDA approval follows three double-blind, placebo controlled trials and two open label 
clinical trials providing data to support the efficacy of the drug.
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
Randgold Resources, down 0.2%. The gold miner was tracking spot gold prices lower quoted at USD1,284.50 an 
ounce compared to USD1,291.72 at the London equities close Friday. Gold prices were lower as the dollar firmed 
and investors shunned safe haven assets as trade tensions between the US and China eased. 
----------
WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: Ryanair Earnings Rise Despite Pilot Shortage
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Ryanair Holdings, up 3.5%. The Irish budget airline reported that revenue in its recent financial year increased on 
the back of lower fares and traffic growth, despite September's "rostering management failure". Ryanair's revenue 
reached EUR7.15 billion, a 7.7% increase year-on-year from EUR6.64 billion in 2017. For the financial year ended 
March, Ryanair said pretax profit rose 10% to EUR1.61 billion, up from EUR1.47 billion the prior year. The company 
said this was due to lower fares increasing passenger traffic by 9%. In the past year, Ryanair lowered fares by 3% 
with the average flight cost at EUR39.4, it said. Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary confidently declared that 
"no other EU airline can compete with Ryanair prices". However, the company declared its outlook as "on the 
pessimistic side of cautious" for 2019

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks were broadly higher at midday on Monday, 
with UK markets hitting a record high, as easing trade war worries boosted the dollar against major currencies and 
helped lift exporters.
After two days of high-level talks, the US and China have agreed to put the trade war on hold and set up a 
framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.4% at 396.40 in late opening deals after falling around 0.3% on 
Friday on concerns over geopolitics and trade.
France's CAC 40 index was rising 0.7% and the UK's FTSE 100 was up 0.9% to reach a record high, while the 
German DAX was down about 0.3%.
French energy group EDF rallied 1.7% on reports that it is in talks to sell part of its UK wind farms.
British power company Drax climbed 2.5%. The company said its bioenergy carbon capture storage (Beccs) project 
of its type in Europe would eventually make it carbon negative.
Airline Ryanair Holdings jumped 3.7% after posting a record annual profit.
AstraZeneca advanced 2.3%. The company has submitted a supplemental new drug application to Japan's 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for use as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with type-1 
diabetes.
International Consolidated Airlines Group gained 1.2% on the buzz that the British Airways-parent plans to offer 
EUR1.52 billion for Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Commodities trader Glencore edged lower following reports that it is facing a bribery probe over its Congolese 
operations.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European markets ended the first session of the new trading 
week with gains. Investors were encouraged by the easing trade tensions between the US and China. The 
countries will refrain from new tariffs that may have sparked a trade war.
"To meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic 
development, China will significantly increase purchases of US goods and services," China and the US said. "This 
will help support growth and employment in the US."
Trading was a bit thinner in Europe today, with several markets closed for the Whit Monday holiday. Economic data 
was also scarce both in the Eurozone and in the US.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.35%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
decreased 0.03%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 0.26%.
The CAC of France rose 0.41% and the FTSE 100 of the UK gained 1.03%. The DAX of Germany and the SMI of 
Switzerland were closed for the holiday.
In Paris, EDF slid 0.12% on reports that it is in talks to sell part of its UK wind farms.
In London, power company Drax climbed 2.23%. The company said its bioenergy carbon capture storage (Beccs) 
project of its type in Europe would eventually make it carbon negative.
Airline Ryanair Holdings jumped 4.97% after posting a record annual profit.
AstraZeneca advanced 3.36%. The company has submitted a supplemental new drug application to Japan's 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for use as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with type-1 
diabetes.
European Markets Climb As Trade War Concerns Ease
International Consolidated Airlines Group gained 1.58% on the buzz that the British Airways-parent plans to offer 
EUR1.52 billion for Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Commodities trader Glencore rose 1.93% following reports that it is facing a bribery probe over its Congolese 
operations.
House prices in the UK were up 0.8% on month in May, property tracking website Rightmove said on Monday. That 
followed the 0.4% monthly increase in April.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC reported Monday a 10% increase in annual profit after tax to 
equity holders of parent to EUR1.45 billion, saying that lower fares - which were down 3% - stimulated 9% traffic 
growth to over 130 million passengers. 
Load factor was 95% for the full year. 
Earnings per share was EUR1.20 compared to EUR1.05.
Full year 2018 total operating revenue from continuing operations rose 8% year-over-year to EUR7.15 billion. 
Traffic grew 9% with Germany, Italy and Spain being the company's largest growth markets.
Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said: "We are pleased to report a 10% increase in profits, with an 
unchanged net margin of 20%, despite a 3% cut in air fares, during a year of overcapacity in Europe, leading to a 
weaker fare environment, rising fuel prices, and the recovery from our Sept. 2017 rostering management failure."
Ryanair said its outlook for financial 2019 is on the pessimistic side of cautious. The company expects to grow 
traffic by 7% to 139 million, at flat load factors of 95%. Unit costs in the current year will rise 9%.

LONDON (Alliance News) -  Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Friday that it has appointed Roisin

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday reported growth in April passengers

"Ryanair customers can look forward to more low fares and an improved customer experience in 2018 as we roll

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Boeing Co and Ryanair Holdings PLC announced Tuesday they have finalized an order 
by Ryanair Holdings PLC of 25 additional high-capacity 737 MAX 8 airplanes.
The USD3 billion order, at current list prices, was previously listed as unidentified on Boeing's Orders & Deliveries 
website.
Ryanair expects to take delivery of the first of what it calls its "Gamechanger" 737 Max 200 aircraft in spring 2019.
Ryanair launched the high-capacity 737 MAX 8 in late 2014 with an order for 100 airplanes, followed by an 
additional order for 10 airplanes at the 2017 Paris Air Show. The airplane will provide Ryanair with 197 seats, 
increasing revenue potential and delivering up to 14% lower fuel consumption than today's Next-Generation 737s.
The Dublin-based carrier is the largest 737-800 customer in the world and the largest Boeing operator in Europe.
Boeing noted that Ryanair took delivery of its 500th Next-Generation 737-800 last month and has now ordered 
more than 650 Boeing airplanes.
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said: "We are pleased to announce the exercise of 25 Boeing 737 
"Gamechanger" options, bringing our firm order to 135 737 MAX 8s. The Gamechanger has eight more seats than 
our current 189-seat Boeing 737-800NG and incorporates the latest technology engines and winglets which reduce 
fuel consumption and noise emissions, ensuring we remain Europe's greenest, cleanest airline and lowest cost 
airline."
Ryanair shares were down 0.2% at EUR15.62 in London early Tuesday.

misconduct against Chief Executive Martin Sorrell, while airlines Wizz Air and Ryanair saw a rise in passengers and 
load factor in March and Smith & Nephew appointed a new CEO.
"The trade war between the US and China is still bubbling away in the background," notes David Madden, market 
analyst at CMC Markets.
"Beijing were measured in their response in relation to the tariffs, and now the ball is in Donald Trump's court. Trade 
disputes aren't solved quickly so it is likely to be in the headlines for some time," Madden adds.

in response to an allegation of personal misconduct against Chief Executive Martin Sorrell.
The investigation is ongoing, WPP said, and the allegations "do not involve amounts which are material to WPP".

assets, as well as investing allegations of improper personal behavior. 
Smith & Nephew said it has appointed Namal Nawana as Chief Executive, and will join the company on May 7. 
Most recently, Namal was CEO of medical diagnostics company Alere Inc. Prior to Alere, Namal spent more than

and realised cost savings.
Reported revenue for the full year is expected to be around 50% higher than the prior year, with a "similar trend" in 
underlying Ebitda.

licensed products in China driving further growth in the period," Entertainment One said.
The second half of the financial year saw the retail landscape affected by Toys R Us store closures in the US and 
UK. Entertainment One said it expects there to be some impact for its brands in the short term and "is monitoring 
the situation closely with its partners".
"This impact is not anticipated to be significant. Overall, eOne's brands performed well in Q4 2017 with strong sell-
through outside of Toys R Us stores," the company said.

management expectations, with its overall regard to underlying trading and cash performance for the year similarly

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
The so-called Beast from the East's cold snap in the UK failed to freeze grocery sales as retailers lost out on just 
GBP22 million in sales, according to the latest UK grocery market share figures published by Kantar Worldpanel. 
Sales at German retailers Lidl and Aldi grew around 10% year-on-year in the 12 week period to March 25, with both 
retailers competing to become the country's fastest growing supermarket chain. This compares to sales growth for 
the big four UK supermarkets of 2.4% for Tesco, 0.6% for J Sainsbury, 2.4% for WM Morrison Supermarkets and 
1.8% for Asda, part of Wal-Mart Stores. Meanwhile, Waitrose recorded growth of 1.5% and online grocer Ocado 
Group of 9.3%. Tesco's market share remained steady at 27.6% in the 12-week period. Sainsbury's market share 
fell by 0.3 percentage point to 15.8%. Asda's market share fell back by 0.2 percentage point to 15.6%, while 
Morrisons' share fell to 10.4% from 10.5% a year ago.

Advertising giant WPP said that it has appointed independent counsel to conduct an investigation in response to an 
allegation of personal misconduct against Chief Executive Martin Sorrell. The investigation is ongoing, WPP said, 
and the allegations "do not involve amounts which are material to WPP". The Wall Street Journal had reported 
earlier that WPP's board was looking into whether Sorrell misused company assets, as well as investigating 
allegations of improper personal behavior made against the CEO.
----------
Smith & Nephew said it appointed former Alere boss Namal Nawana as its new chief executive officer from May 7. 
Nawana will replace current CEO Olivier Bohuon who said in October he planned to retire by the end of 2018. 
Bohuon has headed the FTSE 100-listed medical devices firm since 2011. Nawana most recently served as chief 
executive at US medical diagnostics firm Alere between 2014 and October 2017 when it was acquired by Abbott in

a USD5.30 billion deal. This was after he joined the firm in 2012 and chief operating officer. Prior to Alere, Nawana 
had spent more than 15 years at Johnson & Johnson where he chiefly worked in its medical devices and 
diagnostics unit.

Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air both said they saw rises in passenger numbers and load factor in March. Ryanair 
said customers rose 6% in March to 10.0 million from 9.4 million a year earlier, as load factor improved to 95% from 
94% "on the back of lower fares". Rolling annual traffic to March grew 9% to 130.3 million customers, the company

MARKETS
----------
London shares were down on trade war fears as China retaliated against the US as it revealed a fresh round of 
tariffs on 106 US products. The euro was slightly higher against the dollar after data showed inflation picked up in 
March, while unemployment rate fell. Wall Street was pointed to a lower open. 
----------
FTSE 100: down 0.4% at 7,000.20
FTSE 250: down 0.6% at 19,284.45

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK construction activity contracted unexpectedly in March following five months of marginal growth, survey data 
from IHS Markit showed. The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing 
Managers' Index fell to 47.0 in March from 51.4 in February. The reading was expected to ease to 51.0. The score 
fell below the 50.0 no-change threshold for the first time in six months. Moreover, the latest reading signaled the 
fastest decline in construction output since July 2016. Unusually bad weather conditions had been a key factor 
behind the drop in construction output. Business activity expectations and job creation both picked up in March, 
which provides a clear signal that construction firms anticipate a rebound in activity during the months ahead. The 
overall reduction in construction output was driven by the sharpest drop in civil engineering work for five years. 
Commercial activity also decreased in March.
----------
Annual inflation in the eurozone jumped to 1.4% in March, ending several months of decline, according to an initial 
estimate. The European Central Bank's annual inflation target is just below 2%. The rise was led by food, alcohol 
and tobacco prices, which increased by 2.2% compared to March 2017, according to the European Union's 
statistics agency, Eurostat. Energy prices rose by 2% year on year, followed by smaller increases in the cost of 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: 'Beast From The East' Fails To Freeze Grocery Sales
services and non-energy industrial goods. Overall inflation stood at 1.1% in February, following three consecutive 
months of decline.
----------
Seasonally-adjusted unemployment in the 19-member eurozone dropped to 8.5% in February, down from 8.6% the 
month before, the EU's statistical office said. The figure in February marks the lowest level of unemployment since 
December 2008, Eurostat said, noting that the number of people without jobs fell to just over 13.9 million in the euro 
area. Joblessness in the EU as a whole stood at 7.1% in February, which is a decrease from 7.2% in January. The 
February figure is the lowest since September 2008.
----------
China's Commerce Ministry announced plans for retaliatory tariffs on USD50 billion worth of US products including 
cars, chemical products, soybeans and aircraft. China will raise tariffs of 25% on a total of 106 US products, the 
government said. The move is the latest in a series of tit-for-tat measures between the economic giants, with 
investors fearing an imminent trade war. The announcement came hours after the US published a list of USD50 
billion worth of Chinese imports that could be subject to punitive tariffs. The list of 1,300 products published by the 
US Trade Representative will undergo further review over the next 60 days before a final decision is made on which 
of them will be subject to the additional 25% duties. The Chinese tariffs will be implemented at a later date, 
depending on when the US will impose its own tariffs, the Beijing government said.
----------
The service sector in China continued to expand in March, albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Caixin 
revealed on Wednesday with a services PMI score of 52.3. That's down from 54.2 in February, and it missed 
expectations for 54.5 - although it remains above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from 
contraction.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline firm Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday it was preparing to acquire 
a 75% stake in LaudaMotion - which acquired the assets of former Austrian airline Niki - for less than EUR50 
million.
LaudaMotion was created when former Formula One racing driver Niki Lauda in January acquired the assets of the 
insolvent holiday airline which had founded originally.  
Ryanair will acquire an initial 24.9% stake in LaudaMotion. Subject to regulatory approval, Ryanair plans to increase 
this to 75% "as soon as possible". 
If approved, Ryanair said the 75% stake would cost less than EUR50 million to buy. Ryanair will, however, also 
provide a further EUR50 million for first year start up and operating costs.
For the year ended March 2017, Ryanair generated EUR1.47 billion in pretax profit on revenue of EUR6.65 billion.
LaudaMotion is expected to reach profitability by the third year of its operations. That is assuming their plan to grow 
its fleet to at least 30 Airbus aircraft is successful, Ryanair added.
"We look forward to working in partnership with Niki Lauda to successfully develop his vision for a successful 
Austrian low fares airline to service the schedule and charter markets," Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael 
O'Leary said. "The LaudaMotion AOC will support a fleet of Airbus aircraft which is something we have hoped to 
develop within the Ryanair Group for some years."
"LaudaMotion will benefit from this partnership between Niki Lauda and Ryanair", O'Leary added. "With access to 
the Ryanair fleet and financial resources, LaudaMotion will now grow more rapidly, as it seeks to compete in a 
market which is dominated by Lufthansa's high airfares with its Swiss and Austrian subsidiaries."
"This LaudaMotion partnership is good news for Austrian and German consumers/visitors who can now look 
forward to real competition, more choice and lower fares", O'Leary continued. "It is also great news for

LaudaMotion's people who can look forward to improved job security and more promotional opportunities in Vienna 
and other bases as we work with Niki Lauda and his team to accelerate growth of LaudaMotion - Austria's low fares 
airline."
In January, Niki Lauda won the bidding process to acquire the assets of the former Niki airline over British Airways-
owner International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC, which had bid EUR20 million.
Shares in Ryanair were 1.1% lower at EUR16.38 in early trading in London on Tuesday.

Berlin/FRANKFURT (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair's marketing director warned on Tuesday that 
unions may disrupt their move to fill the gap in the market left by insolvent flight company Air Berlin.
"When you now have unions and you have union recognition, you can have some disruption," said Kenny Jacobs at 
a press conference in Berlin.
"We haven't had that yet, but we are saying it can happen at some point in the future."
Ryanair is planning to expand the number of services it runs to and from German airports from 24 to 243 by next 
winter.
This year the company aims to see a 13% increase of passengers flying from German airports, with the total rising 
to 19.7 million.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary is due to meet German aviation union Vereinigung Cockpit.
In December, Ryanair agreed to recognize pilot unions for the first time as part of efforts to avoid planned strike 
action during the Christmas holiday season.
Various European budget airlines have made overtures to fill the gap left by the dissolution of German flight 
company Air Berlin after it stopped trading last October.
According to Lufthansa sister company Eurowings' own information, the firm plans to roll its service out with another 
70,000 flights carrying an additional 8 million passengers this year.

reported Tuesday, with 300 jobs to potentially be axed.
Ryanair is to also cut the number of routes out of Glasgow to just three from 32, the BBC said.
The company has blamed the change on the cost of air passenger duty. The only services to survive the cut are 
those to Dublin in Ireland and the Polish cities of Wroclaw and Krakow. However, 11 new routes will be added from 
Edinburgh.
The closing of the base, expected to occur this November, will put 300 jobs at risk with a potential 500,000 drop in 
passenger numbers, the BBC said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Monday it will operate from two new airports in Germany 
from summer 2018 amid a wider expansion of German routes to Palma de Mallorca in Spain.
The Irish budget airline said it would operate from two new airports in Germany for the first time in summer 2018: 
Berlin's Tegel and Dusseldorf. 
Ryanair also said four new German peak summer routes to Mallorca have been announced from Tegel, Dusseldorf, 
Nuremberg and Stuttgart. Further flights have also been introduced from Cologne and Dortmund.
"Ryanair is pleased to announce two new German airports on its S18 network with new Palma de Mallorca flights 
from Berlin (Tegel) and Dusseldorf," Ryanair Chief Commercial Officer David O'Brien said. "More German 
customers can now book their summer flights to Mallorca with new routes also operating from Nuremburg and 
Stuttgart. These new routes and extra flights will operate from June to August and are on sale from today on 
Ryanair.com."
In December 2017, rival budget airline easyJet PLC gained access to Tegel airport through its acquisition of part of 
defunct Air Berlin's operations at the Berlin airport. As part of the deal, FTSE 100-listed easyJet gained access to 
slots at Tegel.
Shares in Ryanair were 0.3% higher at EUR16.32 on Monday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Analysts expect International Consolidated Airlines Group to report a rise in operating 
profit for 2017, as the airline operator had originally anticipated. 
IAG owns airlines including British Airways, Spain's Iberia and Vueling as well as Ireland's Aer Lingus.
IAG shares are up 0.6% at 620.40 pence. The stock has risen 23% over the past 12 months. 
Over the past year, UK-listed airlines such as IAG, easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air, have benefitted from reduced 
competition in the sector following the collapse of holiday airline Monarch in October, when it became the biggest 
UK airline ever to cease trading. Monarch's troubles followed those of European carriers such as Italy's Alitalia and 
Germany's Air Berlin.
In October, IAG had said it expects adjusted operating profit for 2017 to surge higher to around EUR3.00 billion, 
after reporting substantial growth over the first nine months of the year. 
The group said operating profit before exceptional items for the nine months to end of September rose 27% to 
EUR2.43 billion from EUR1.91 billion the year before. Revenue climbed 1.3% to EUR17.50 billion from EUR17.27 
billion. 
For the full year, IAG had said it expects adjusted operating profit - which excludes exceptional items - to come in at 
around EUR3.00 billion based on current fuel prices and currency rates, compared to 2016's result of EUR2.54 
billion.
According to the analyst consensus for 2017, IAG is expected to record an operating profit before exceptional items 
of EUR3.04 billion. IAG made an operating profit of EUR2.48 billion in 2016, up 7.2% from the EUR2.32 billion it 
made a year before.
Analysts at Barclays expect revenue for 2017 to come in at EUR22.94 billion. Total revenue for 2016 dipped 1.3% 
to EUR22.57 billion from EUR22.86 billion the year before.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC faces a four hour strike in Italy on Saturday after 
three unions confirmed their call for action despite Italy's main pilot union stating it would not participate, Reuters 
reported Friday.
Italian unions CGIL, CISL and UIL - which mainly represent cabin and ground crew - recommended the strike after 
they were not included in contract negotiations with Ryanair. The strike will be for four hours on Saturday.
In December, Ryanair confirmed it would recognise unions for all staff. However, the Irish firm said it wanted to 
formalise relations with pilots unions first. It is, Reuters reported, struggling to do this in some countries.
In the UK, Ryanair has agreed a deal with pilot union BALPA. In Spain, however, SEPLA said Ryanair's 
management was not negotiating in good faith earlier this week.
In Italy, however, the pilot union ANPAC said it would not participate in the current proposed strike. Its reasoning 
was that it was currently in talks with Ryanair which include the possibility of a pay increase.
"Talks are proceeding with a good attitude," ANPAC official Riccardo Canestrari said. "We are slowly solving all the 
problems."
Shares in Ryanair closed 0.3% lower at EUR15.72 on Friday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been cleared to describe itself as "Europe's No. 1 airline" 
following complaints that widespread cancellations last year made the claim misleading.
The TV and radio ads in September and October included voice-overs saying: "Discover why more and more 
people are choosing Europe's number one airline" and "Discover why we're Europe's number one airline".
A poster ad, seen on the London Underground on October 2, featured the headline claim: "Europe's No.1 Airline".
The Advertising Standards Authority received 13 complaints from people who claimed the ads were misleading in 
light of Ryanair cancelling tens of thousands of flights last year because of errors in how pilots were rostered for 
work.
Ryanair said the number one claim was a statement of fact, supported by a third-party statistical report, and 
therefore not misleading.
It said the claim was based on the most recent International Air Transport Association World Air Transport Statistics 
2017 report for air travel in 2016, which found Ryanair was the world's largest airline for international flights and 
Europe's largest airline for international and domestic flights combined.
Ryanair said the recent cancellation of flights, which affected less than 0.5% of their 129 million customers last 
year, did not materially alter this fact.
The ASA said consumers were likely to understand the number one claim to mean that Ryanair had carried more 
passengers than any other European airline over a reasonable time before the ads were produced.
It said: "While we acknowledged some of the complainants' views of Ryanair were that it was not their personal 
number one airline due to the recent flight cancellations, we considered they would nevertheless still interpret the 
claim to be an objective statement about the number of passengers who had travelled on Ryanair flights compared 
to all other European airlines.
Ryanair Cleared To Advertise Itself As "Europe's No. 1 Airline"
"Because the most recent available figures showed Ryanair had carried more passengers than any other European 
airline, we concluded that the claim 'Europe's No.1 Airline' was unlikely to mislead consumers."
Ryanair shares were down 0.6% at EUR16.03 early Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Spanish trade union SEPLA is to take action against Ryanair Holdings PLC over 
contracts they say fail to comply with Spanish law, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
SEPLA, Reuters said, has accused Ryanair of failing to negotiate in good faith since the airline opened union 
recognition talks. 
It is to submit two lawsuits to Spain's High Court. The union represents some 500 of the 800 Ryanair pilots based in 
Spain, Reuters said. 
The airline has said it fully complies with all EU and Spanish employment law, and said an appeal court ruling in 
Valencia in January means Spanish courts have no jurisdiction over Ryanair employment.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday kept a cautious outlook for its full financial year 2018 
despite reporting growth in profit and revenue for the third quarter.
The budget airline said it still expects full-year profit in the range of EUR1.40 billion to EUR1.45 billion, but said this 
guidance depends heavily on several events not taking place, including the absence of union disruption, 
unforeseen security events, and close-in Easter bookings.
Ryanair added that it remained concerned about the continued uncertainty surrounding the terms of Brexit, with the 
risk of serious disruption to UK to EU flights from April 2019 unless some arrangement is agreed to before 
September. 
As part of its contingency planning, Ryanair said it has applied to the UK Civil Aviation Authority for a UK air 
operator's certificate, confident that the process will complete before the September deadline.
For the third quarter to the end of December,  Ryanair reported growth in customers carried at 30.4 million, up 6.0% 
from the same quarter the year before.
Profit before tax rose by 12% to EUR112.9 million from EUR106.2 million, on revenue that grew to EUR1.40 billion 
from EUR1.35 billion the prior year.
In addition, the airline said it has approved a EUR750.0 million buyback of shares which will start in February and is 
expected to be conclude by the end of October.
"Our outlook for the remainder of 2018 is cautious. As we finalise union discussions along similar lines to that 
agreed in the UK, we expect some localised disruptions and adverse PR so investors should be prepared for same. 
In certain jurisdictions unions representing competitor airlines will wish to test our commitment to our low cost, high 
pay/high productivity model to disrupt our operations. We are fully prepared to face down any such disruption if it 
means defending our cost base or our high productivity model," sad Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Cautious On Outlook Despite Quarterly Profit Rises
Looking further out to financial 2019, Ryanair said: "While we have practically zero visibility on FY19 fares, and our 
budget is not yet finalised, we do not share the optimism of competitors and market commentators for summer 2018 
fare rises. Our traffic will grow by 6% in FY19 to 138 million but very early indications are that summer 2018 fares 
will remain under pressure."
"Costs will rise next year as our fuel bill increases by over EUR300 million and a further EUR100 million is added to 
staff costs (as up to 20% pilot pay increases annualise). The lack of clarity on Brexit continues to overhang fares 
and pricing on routes to/from the UK. We would, even at this early date, urge extreme caution on investor & analyst 
assumptions for fares in FY19."

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Monday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Kingfisher, up 2.3%. Shares in the DIY retailer - which owns the B&Q store chains in the UK - were higher after 
Australian DIY retailer, which owns Homebase in the UK, announced executive changes at Bunnings, its 
underperforming UK hardware business that was responsible for the majority of its AUD1.30 billion in first-half 
writedowns and impairments. "Once identified as the great strategic threat to other traditional DIY players, 
Bunnings/Homebase's lacklustre performances have actually proved to be a benefit to the likes of Wickes (Travis 
Perkins) and B&Q (Kingfisher)," analysts at Davy said. Travis Perkins shares were up 0.3%.

FTSE 100 - LOSERS

easyJet, down 2.6%. Shares in the budget airline were suffering a negative read-across after peer Ryanair Holdings 
maintained a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. "While we have practically zero visibility on 2019 fares, 
and our budget is not yet finalised, we do not share the optimism of competitors and market commentators for 
summer 2018 fare rises. Our traffic will grow by 6% in 2019 to 138 million but very early indications are that summer 
2018 fares will remain under pressure," Ryanair said. Ryanair shares were down 2.8%. 
Randgold Resources, down 1.7%. The gold miner said sales and profit grew in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 
strong year, but noted that a "draconian" mining code is being considered by the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
The company said pretax profit increased by 18% for the fourth quarter to USD114.3 million, from USD96.8 million 
in the third quarter, and by 19% for the year to USD480.9 million, from USD402.6 million in 2016. However,

Randgold warned it is currently engaging at the highest level with the government of Congo to head off the 
enactment of a new mining code, which it believes will severely limit the growth of the mining industry in the 
country. The new code was passed last week by both houses of Congo's parliament, but still has to be signed into 
law by the president.

FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
Electrocomponents, up 1.6%. The electrical parts supplier said it experienced "strong" underlying revenue growth in 
the start of its second half, with all regions experiencing double-digit growth as it continues to look for cost savings. 
Underlying revenue for the four months ended January grew 14%. This was helped by 22% growth from its Asia 
Pacific region with the Americas and Europe growing 12% and 13% respectively. The firm explained the market 
backdrop remains "positive" and it continues to execute well with its improvements. For the year ending March 
2018, Electrocomponents expects to deliver "stable" gross margins. In the year prior, gross margins stood at 
43.4%. 
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Veltyco Group, up 13%. The online marketing firm said it expects 2017 results to be "significantly ahead" of market 
expectations after "strong" trading at the end of the year. The group anticipates net revenue to be in excess of 
EUR14.5 million, more than double the EUR6.1 million reported the year prior. Operating earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation are expected to be in excess of EUR8.0 million, almost four times the EUR2.1 
million the year before. The firm said this was after December trading continued to be "strong".

MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
Shield Therapeutics, down 51%. The pharmaceutical firm said its Feraccru treatment failed to demonstrate efficacy 
in an initial clinical trial. The company said Feraccru failed to meet the study's primary endpoint of demonstrating a 
statistical difference in the change of haemoglobin from baseline compared to a placebo at 16 weeks. The response 
at 8 weeks demonstrated separation of the treatment arms, which was not sustained to week 16. The Feraccru 
AEGIS-CKD study was a pivotal phase III trial with a primary endpoint evaluating haemoglobin response compared 
to a placebo in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia patients with chronic kidney disease. Top-line data was 
based on the 16-week primary endpoint, with 168 subjects enrolled in 30 renal centres across the US. Feraccru is a 
novel oral ferric iron therapy that has been approved and marketed in Europe since 2016 for the treatment of iron 
deficiency anemia, initially in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

The owner of British Airways is calling for an end to Heathrow's "monopoly" on the airport's terminals, saying 
competition between third operators would lower costs for passengers. International Consolidated Airlines Group 
was responding to a consultation related to Heathrow's expansion, saying the development provides "a great 
opportunity" for independent firms to design, build and run commercial facilities at the airport, including terminals. 
IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said: "Heathrow's had it too good for too long and the government must confirm 
the CAA's (Civil Aviation Authority) powers to introduce this type of competition. This would cut costs, diversify 
funding and ensure developments are completed on time, leading to a win-win for customers."
----------
Electrocomponents said it experienced "strong" underlying revenue growth in the start of its second half, with all 
regions experiencing double-digit growth as it continues to look for cost savings. Underlying revenue for the four 
months ended January grew 14%. This was helped by 22% growth from its Asia Pacific region with the Americas

Electrocomponents expects to deliver "stable" gross margins. In the year prior, gross margins stood at 43.4%. 
----------
Wizz Air said it saw significant growth in passenger numbers in January, though load factor declined slightly. 
Passengers were up 24% year-on-year to 2.3 million, from 2.1 million in January 2017, while capacity rose 25% to 
2.7 million seats. However, load factor fell 0.3 percentage points in January to 87.7% from 88.0% a year earlier. For 
the rolling 12 months to the end of January, passengers rose 24% to 28.7 million, while load factor improved by 1.9 
percentage points to 91.3% from 89.4%. Capacity in the period rose 22% to 31.5 million seats. Available seat 
kilometres rose 24% in January to 4.2 million, up 23% on a 12 month rolling basis, while revenue passenger 
kilometres rose 24% to 3.7 million in January and was up 26% on a rolling 12 month basis.

(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK service sector activity expanded at the slowest pace in nearly one-and-a-half years in January, survey data from 
IHS Markit showed. The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index, 
dropped more-than-expected to 53.0 in January from 54.2 in December. It was forecast to fall to 54.0. However, 
any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. Growth was reportedly curtailed by the loss of existing 
clients and lingering concerns surrounding the UK's exit from the EU. New orders increased at a slightly quicker 
pace in January, but the rate of growth weaker than 2017 average. Job creation nonetheless picked up as 
companies retained positive expectations surrounding the outlook.
----------
The euro area economy expanded at the fastest pace pace since mid-2006 in January, final data from IHS Markit 
showed. The final composite output index rose more than initially estimated to 58.8 in January from 58.1 in 
December. The flash score was 58.6. The headline index has signalled expansion for 55 successive months and 
the latest score was the highest since June 2006. "If this level is maintained over February and March, the PMI is 
indicating that first quarter GDP would rise by approximately 1.0% quarter-on-quarter," Chris Williamson, chief 
business economist at IHS Markit, said.
----------
Downing Street has insisted the UK will not be in a customs union after Brexit as Tory tensions over the 
government's plans continued to simmer. The move by Number 10 to "categorically" state the UK will be leaving the 
customs union came as UK Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit Secretary David Davis prepared to hold talks 
with Brussels' chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Confirmation of the government's approach may placate Tory 
MPs and ministers who are keen for a Brexit arrangement which allows the UK to strike trade deals around the 
world - something which a customs union could have prevented. But business leaders have urged the government 
to remain in a customs union and Tory Brexit rebel Anna Soubry urged Number 10 to "do the maths" and listen to 
company bosses. She claimed the "hard Brexit" European Research Group of Tory MPs, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, 
had a "deeply unattractive" plan which involved leaving the customs union "to chase unicorn trade deals" at the 
expense of existing relations with the EU.
----------
Ireland's service sector activity continued to expand strongly at the start of the year, survey data from IHS Markit 
showed. The services Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 59.8 in January from 60.4 in December. The overall 
growth in January was driven by new order growth and improving economic conditions.
----------
Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have delayed their formal 
decision on forming a new German government until Monday. Talks between between Merkel's Christian 
Democrats (CDU), her ally Christian Social Union (CSU), and the SPD will continue at 10 am local time at the 
SPD's offices, the centre-left party's General Secretary Lars Klingbeil said Sunday evening in Berlin. The top circle 
of negotiators decided to forgo a late-night meeting after they established that the parties stand apart from each 
other on several issues that require thorough, concentrated discussion, Klingbeil said. The central issues still to be 
decided include "two class medicine" in Germany and fixed-term employment contracts.
----------
China's private sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in seven years in January driven by accelerated rates of 
activity growth across both manufacturing and services. The Caixin composite Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 
53.7 in January from 53.0 in December, data from IHS Markit showed Monday. The services PMI came in at 54.7 at 
the start of the year compared to 53.9 in December. At the same time, manufacturers signalled the quickest upturn 
in production levels since December 2016.

Following the release of a controversial memo alleging misconduct by FBI and Justice Department officials, top 
Democratic lawmakers have warned US President Donald Trump against using the document as a pretext to fire 
either Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein or Special Counsel Robert Mueller.The top House and Senate 
Democrats sent a letter to Trump on Friday warning that firing Rosenstein or Mueller would be considered an 
attempt to obstruct justice and spark a constitutional crisis.

Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve for the past four years, will join the Brookings Institution as a fellow in 
economic studies, the think tank said. She follows in the footsteps of Ben Bernanke, her immediate predecessor, 
former vice chair Don Kohn, and Nellie Liang, former director of its division of financial stability. Yellen's term 
officially ended on Saturday, with Trump's appointee Jerome "Jay" Powell taking the helm.
----------
The US is considering sanctions against Venezuela's critical oil industry, Washington's top diplomat Rex Tillerson 
said in Argentina. The US would consider imposing restrictions on Venezuela's oil exports, Tillerson said in Buenos 
Aires, where he urged Argentinian Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie to take tougher action against the government of 
Nicolas Maduro in Caracas.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets ended the first trading day of the new 
week firmly in negative territory. The loss extended the recent losing streak across the pond to six straight sessions.
Global equity markets were under pressure after Friday's strong US employment report cemented the belief among

conservative party and the Social Democrats broke down over the weekend.

The euro area economy expanded at the fastest pace since mid-2006 in January, final data from IHS Markit 
showed Monday. The final composite output index rose more than initially estimated to 58.8 in January from 58.1 in 
December. The flash score was 58.6.

of retail trade dropped 1.1% month-on-month in December, in contrast to the 2% rise posted in November. Sales 
were forecast to drop 1%.
British service sector activity expanded at a slower pace in January, largely reflecting weak gains in new work as 
Brexit remains the main course of concern, survey data from IHS Markit showed Monday.
The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index, dropped more-than-
expected to 53.0 in January from 54.2 in December. The expected reading was 54.0.
China's private sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in seven years in January driven by accelerated rates of

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said it saw growth in both customers 
and load factor in January.
Customers rose 6% year-on-year to 9.3 million in January from 8.8 million a year earlier, while load factor rose by 
one percentage point to 91% from 90%. The carrier said the rise was due to lower fares.
Rolling annual traffic to January grew 9% to 129 million customers.
"Ryanair customers can look forward to more low fares and an improved customer experience in 2018 as we roll 
out more AGB improvements, so we urge all customers who wish to book their summer 2018 holidays to do so now 
on the Ryanair.com website or mobile app," said 
Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday that it has signed a formal union recognition 
agreement with the British Airline Pilots Association, who will now be the sole representative body for the 
company's UK pilots.
"Today's agreement between Ryanair and BALPA shows that Ryanair can work with unions that wish to work with 
us to promote the interests of both our pilots and our customers," said Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson.
The UK region accounts for almost 100 of Ryanair's 400 plus current aircraft fleet and over 25% of pilot body.
Earlier in January, the Irish budget airline said all of its UK pilots had agreed to accept a 20% rise in their 
paychecks, after pilots based at its biggest UK operation, London Stansted, initially had rejected the deal. The pilots 
had initially rejected the offer over concerns about pilot staffing, after Ryanair suffered shortages starting last 
Autumn, and about employment terms and conditions.
Ryanair also was in talks with the remaining 35% of Dublin pilots, who have yet to accept the pay increase. The 
majority of Ryanair's pilots in Ireland have agreed to the 20% pay increase, and the majority of pilots in Dublin, who 
are contractors or new joiners, have also already agreed them.
"This rapid progress in the UK is in marked contrast to some other EU countries where we are still waiting for a 
response to our recognition proposals and where some unions have failed to put these substantial pay increases to 
our pilots. We now call on these unions to stop wasting time and act quickly to deliver 20% pay increases to our 
pilots in February, and conclude formal recognition agreements, which they are presently sitting on," Wilson said.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.2% at 16.65 pence in early trade.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Informa said its takeover of UBM will lead to an events giant benefiting from increased scale and industry 
specialisation, after the two parties confirmed an almost GBP4 billion mixed cash-and-shares offer by Informa for 
UBM. Informa said the enlarged company, likely to have a market capitalisation of more than GBP9 billion, will 
create value for shareholders through "increased operating scale and industry specialisation". Informa expects 
operating synergies including at least GBP60.0 million of annual recurring pretax cost savings, with around 
GBP50.0 million of this to come in 2019, which will come from scale efficiencies and the reduction of duplicate 
costs. For each UBM share, Informa is to offer 1.083 Informa shares, plus 163.00 pence in cash. Based on the 
closing price of 746.00p per Informa share on January 15, the last business day before the offer was made, this 
values UBM at around GBP3.90 billion and 971.00p per UBM share. This would be a premium of 30% to UBM's 
747.50p closing price on January 15.

Miner Anglo American said its De Beers diamond business saw an encouraging sales performance in its first sales 
cycle of 2018, despite sales coming in lower than the first cycle of 2017. De Beers generated sales of USD665.0 
million in the sales cycle, 8.8% behind the USD729.0 million generated in the first cycle of 2017, but 46% ahead of 
the USD455.0 million reported for the tenth cycle of 2017. "Following positive early signs for diamond jewellery 
sales over the holiday season in the US, the need for the industry to restock led to increasing demand for our rough 
diamonds in the first sales cycle of 2018. This seasonal restocking demand does usually see a larger share of 
annual purchases being planned into the first sales cycle of the year by our customers, resulting in an encouraging 
sales performance," De Beers Chief Executive Bruce Cleaver said.
----------
PZ Cussons said profitability was hit in the first half of its financial year by reduced margins in Europe and Africa, 
despite strong performance in Asia, though revenue for the period rose. Pretax profit for the six months to 
November was up 37% to GBP34.2 million from GBP24.9 million. However, removing exceptional items, adjusted 
pretax profit fell 15% at reported exchange rates to GBP34.0 million from GBP40.2 million, falling 14% on a like-for-
like basis. For the half-year, PZ Cussons posted net exceptional income of GBP200,000. However, the previous 
year it incurred costs of GBP15.3 million due to foreign exchange losses in Nigeria and a reorganisation project. 
Revenue for the half rose 1.9% year-on-year to GBP385.4 million from GBP378.2 million, driven by a strong 
product pipeline, the company said. The personal care products maker has maintained its interim dividend at the 
same level as last year, paying out 2.67 pence per share.
----------
Domino's Pizza Group said it saw double-digit growth in sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, with its performance 
ahead of management expectations. Total systems sales rose 18% to GBP321.8 million in the fourth quarter from 
GBP272.4 million a year before, with organic growth of 10%. System sales were up by 8.9% in 2017 as a whole on 
an organic basis, with high growth in both established and newer markets. UK & Republic of Ireland systems sales 
for the quarter was GBP294.7 million, up 10% from GBP267.8 million the prior year, with new store openings and a 
strong like-for-like performance. Sales were up 9.9% in the quarter on an organic basis. For the full year this 
represented a 8.7% rise on an organic basis. Online sales in the UK were up 15% year-on-year representing 77% 
of sales in the quarter, and 37 new stores were opened, taking the total new stores opened in 2017 to 95.
----------
Diploma announced the appointment of Richard Ingram as its new chief executive, replacing long-serving outgoing 
Chief Executive Bruce Thompson. Ingram, who will join the board on April 23, will take over responsibilities as chief 
executive on May 8. Thompson is to retire by the end of September this year, and will remain between then and 
May to support the transition. The specialised technical product provider, which serves the Life Sciences, Seals and 
Control markets, said Ingram brings a "wide range of executive and leadership expertise". He is currently president 
of Smiths Detection, part of Smiths Group, and spent the early part of his career at Royal Dutch Shell. Thompson 
was appointed Diploma's CEO in 1996, having first joined the company in 1994.

MARKETS
----------
London shares were lower with the heavyweight mining sector weighing on the FTSE 100. The pound was firm 
against the dollar after data showed an increase in UK consumer and mortgage lending, although the number of 
mortgage approvals fell. Wall Street was pointed to a lower open following a sell-off overnight. Tuesday evening in 
Washington, US President Donald Trump will deliver his first State of the Union address.

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK mortgage approvals declined in December, figures from the Bank of England showed. The number of mortgage 
approvals fell to 61,039 in December from 64,712 in the previous month. This was the lowest since January 2015 
and also below the expected level of 63,500. Lending to individuals grew GBP5.20 billion in December. Within this, 
secured lending increased GBP3.70 billion or 0.3%, the same rate as logged in November. Similarly, consumer 
credit increased again by GBP1.50 billion in December, slightly bigger than the expected GBP1.40 billion.
----------
Theresa May is facing demands to publish the UK government's latest Brexit analysis following a report it had 
concluded Britain would be worse off, whatever deal is struck with Brussels. As the UK prime minister prepared to 
fly out on a three-day trade mission to China, opposition MPs said the public were entitled to know the true cost of 
leaving the EU. The mood in the party will not have been helped by the leak of latest economic impact assessment, 
drawn up for the Department for Exiting the EU showing growth, would be lower under a range of potential 
scenarios. Even if the UK is able to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement it estimated growth would be 
down 5% over the next 15 years, according to the document seen by the BuzzFeed News website. That would rise 
to 8% if Britain left without a deal and was forced to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules. Alternatively, if the 
UK were to retain access to the single market through membership of the European Economic Area the loss would 
be just 2%.
----------
Meanwhile, the UK government's flagship Brexit bill is set to begin its passage through the House of Lords on 
Tuesday. More than 190 peers are listed to speak in a marathon two-day second reading debate on the EU 
(Withdrawal) Bill .
----------
The euro area economy grew at a slightly slower pace in the fourth quarter, preliminary flash estimate from Eurostat 
showed. Gross domestic product expanded by seasonally adjusted 0.6% sequentially in the fourth quarter, following 
0.7% increase seen in the third quarter. The rate came in line with expectations. Year-on-year, economic growth 
eased marginally to 2.7% from 2.8% in the preceding three months. The EU28 grew 0.6% on quarter and by 2.6% 
on a yearly basis in the fourth quarter. Over the whole year 2017, GDP grew 2.5% in both zones.

The increased pay for UK pilots will be paid by the company in the January payroll. The company said the pay rise 
will see its pilots earnings 20% more than competitor 737 operators, such as Norwegian Airline and Jet2.
Ryanair is separately continuing talks with UK and Irish pilots union over their recognition. Shares in the company 
were up 3.0% at 16.58 pence on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Monday it "smashed" its weekly record 
bookings last week, taking over three million bookings.
Ryanair said it was the first time it has broken the three million bookings in a week barrier, and was a "direct" result 
of its low fares and 'Always Getting Better' customer experience programme. 
Last Wednesday was the busiest day, and the most popular destinations included Lanzarote, Tenerife, Milan, Porto, 
and Naples. 
Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs commented: "We are delighted to announce this new weekly record of over 
three million bookings made on the Ryanair.com website and app last week, the equivalent of: five bookings a 
second; the population of Lithuania; the population of Madrid; more than half of the total passengers Virgin Atlantic 
carry in an entire year."
Ryanair shares were up 0.6% in Monday's early trading in London at EUR16.06.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Next kicked off the post-Christmas retail reporting season with holiday cheer, raising its 
profit guidance for its current financial year after better-than-expected full-price sales in November and December.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 0.2 points lower at 7,647.90, amid a strong pound. The blue chip 
index closed down 0.5%, or 39.67 points at 7,648.10 on Tuesday.
Next, the first UK retailer to update on Christmas shopping, has increased its central guidance for pretax profit for 
the year ending in late January by GBP8.0 million to GBP725.0 million.
The profit guidance range is now between GBP718.0 million and GBP732.0 million. Its previous range, given at the 
start of November, was for profit in a range of GBP692.0 million to GBP742.0 million. The new profit estimate would 
represent a fall in profit from the previous year of 8.3%, compared to the 9.3% drop previously forecast.
Total full price sales for the year are expected to grow 0.3%, having been previously forecast to drop 0.3%.
The upgrade, Next said, comes after better-than-expected full-price sales in the 54 days to December 24. Brand 
total full price sales were up 1.5% in the period, and were up 0.2% in the year-to-date. This 1.5% growth is an 
improvement on the minus 0.3% forecast given in November for the period. 
Irish air carrier Ryanair Holdings reported traffic statistics for December with traffic growing 3% to 9.3 million 
customers and load factor rising by 1 percentage point to 95%. Ryanair also said its rolling annual traffic was up 
10% to 129 million customers.
FTSE 250-listed defence contractor Babcock International Group said it signed an AUD200 million agreement with 
Australian Navy to provide maintenance support services.

"I am delighted that we have successfully achieved the next stage of the contract to look after Australia's ANZAC 
fleet. Babcock has a long and successful history of working with the Australian Navy and we look forward to 
continuing that relationship over the next 14 years," said Chief Executive Archie Bethel.
FTSE 250 residential landlord Grainger said it has exchanged contracts with Abode Hallam to forward fund and 
acquire a private rented sector to build to rent development properties in Eccy Village, Sheffield comprising of 237 
new purpose built homes, for GBP32 million.
Grainger said it expects the investment to generate a gross yield on cost of over 7% with completion of the project 
anticipated by the end of 2019. 
Still to come is the UK construction Purchasing Mangers' Index for December at 0930 GMT.
The reading is expected to come in at 52.7, slightly below November's reading of 53.1. The construction data 
follows Tuesday's UK manufacturing PMI, which was below expectations at 56.3 for December, having been 
forecast at 58.0
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3607 early Wednesday, higher than USD1.3553 at the London equities close on 
Tuesday.
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4%, S&P 500 up 0.8% 
and Nasdaq Composite ending 1.5% higher. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices hit record intraday and closing 
highs.
In US economic news later Wednesday, there are MBA mortgage applications data at 1200 GMT and construction 
spending and ISM manufacturing PMI at 1500 GMT. In addition, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's December 
policy-setting meeting will be released at 1900 GMT, which could potentially shed light on the outlook for US 
interest rates in the new year.
"There has been a sense in markets that the Fed is gearing up to backtrack on its forecast for three rate hikes this 
year because of low inflation. The minutes could help explain how Fed members are juxtaposing lower inflation 
expectations with planning the same pace of rate increases," says David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.
In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.8%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.1%. In Tokyo, 
financial markets are closed for a holiday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Next said it is marginally upgrading profit guidance for its current financial year after better-than-expected full-price 
sales in November and December. Next, the first UK retailer to update on Christmas shopping, has increased its 
central guidance for group pretax profit for the year ending in late January by GBP8.0 million to GBP725.0 million. 
The profit guidance range is now between GBP718.0 million and GBP732.0 million. Its previous range, given at the 
start of November, was for pretax profit in a range of GBP692.0 million to GBP742.0 million. The new profit estimate 
would represent a fall in profit from the previous year of 8.3%, compared to the 9.3% drop previously forecast. Total 
full price sales for the year are expected to grow 0.3%, having been previously forecast to drop 0.3%.
----------
Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings reported growth in passenger numbers and load factor for the month of 
December. Irish carrier Ryanair said the number of customers carried rose by 3.0% to 9.3 million from 9.0 million in 
December 2016, while load factor rose to 95% from 94%. Its rolling annual traffic to December was up 10% to 129 
million customers. On Tuesday, Ryanair confirmed that it is seeking a license to operate in the UK to avoid 
disruptions in case of a hard Brexit. Eastern and Central Europe-focused airline Wizz Air saw a 20% rise in the 
number of passengers carried to 2.2 million from 1.9 million the year before, and a load factor at 87.5%, up from 
87.3%. Its rolling annual traffic was up 24% to 28.3 million customers.

who will develop the site to Grainger's specifications, to also forward fund the 237-home project. Grainger expects 
the investment to generate a gross yield on cost above 7.0% with completion by the end of 2019. Midlands-based

----------
Defence outsourcer Babcock International Group said its joint venture with UGL has been awarded a further five-
year contract worth around GBP115.0 million to provide maintenance support services to the Australian Navy. The 
contract will start this month and will see the naval ship management joint venture with Australian engineering firm 
UGL provide maintenance work on eight ANZAC class frigates, Babcock said. The joint venture will provide 
maintenance for both the ships and their support facilities on Australia's east and west coasts, helping ensure the 
frigates stay in service until at least 2031.
----------
Troubled support services company Carillion said the UK Financial Conduct Authority has started an investigation 
into announcements made by the company. Carillion said the FCA is to look into "the timeliness and content" of 
announcements made between December 7, 2016 and July 10 last year. The support services firm said it is 
cooperating "fully" with the financial regulator. Carillion had a difficult year in 2017, having issued its third profit 
warning in five months in November, though it received a boost in December after its financial covenant tests were 
pushed back from the end of December to April this year by its lenders. Chief Executive-Designate Andrew Davies 
is to join the company on January 22, having previously been expected to come aboard on April 2. 
----------
MARKETS
----------
London share prices were higher with retailers among the blue-chip gainers after Next reported stronger-than-
expected sales over Christmas. Next was up 6.8% near midday. The pound hit a fresh three-month high against the 
dollar in early trade of USD1.3613 but then retreated as data showed UK construction activity grew at a slower pace 
in December. Wall Street was pointed to a higher open following record closing highs on Tuesday. Attention will 
later turn to the minutes of the latest FOMC meeting, due at 1900 GMT. 
----------
FTSE 100: up 0.1% at 7,652.06
FTSE 250: up 0.3% at 20,752.03
AIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.8% at 1,059.41
GBP: firm at USD1.3578 (USD1.3553)

GOLD: flat at USD1,314.27 per ounce (USD1,312.62)
OIL (Brent): flat at USD66.65 a barrel (USD66.73)
(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK construction activity grew at a slower pace in December, survey results from IHS Markit showed. The IHS 
Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-
expected to 52.2 in December from 53.1 in November. The expected score was 53.0. Nonetheless, the indicator 
remained above the 50.0 no change threshold for the third successive month. Among sub sectors, house building 
remained a key engine of growth. In contrast, commercial construction fell moderately. At the same time, civil 
engineering work stabilized, ending a three-month period of decline. There were positive signals for the near-term 
business outlook, with new order growth reaching a seven-month high and job creation the strongest since June.
----------
German unemployment ended 2017 at a record low, with the numbers out of work falling more than twice as much 
as forecast amid robust growth in Europe's biggest economy. Unemployment in seasonally adjusted terms fell for 
the sixth consecutive month in December, dropping by 29,000 to 2.442 million last month, the Federal Labour 
Agency said. The December fall resulted in the unemployment rate coming in at 5.5%, the lowest level since 
German reunification in 1990. The agency also revised down the November rate to 5.5%.

TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Next Reports Jolly UK Christmas Shopping Season
Storm Eleanor has lashed the UK with violent storm-force winds of up to 100mph, leaving thousands of homes 
without power and hitting transport links. Widespread disruption is expected on Wednesday after the storm swept 
across the country overnight carrying heavy rain, hail and dramatic thunder and lightning. Several major bridges 
were closed due to high winds and there were numerous reports of fallen trees blocking roads including the M25. 
Overturned vehicles forced closures on the A1M near Hatfield in Hertfordshire, the M6 near Lancaster and M5 near 
Worcester, where a recovery operation was under way to clear up the contents of a lorry left spilled on the road. An 
object in the overhead lines between London Paddington and Hayes reduced the number of trains leaving the 
major hub, while power outages halted rail services between Letchworth Garden City and Cambridge.
----------
US President Donald Trump threatened to cut aid to the Palestinians, saying they are "no longer willing to talk 
peace". "We pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or 
respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel," he wrote on Twitter. "We have 
taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. 
But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future 
payments to them?" Trump last month drew international condemnation when he recognized the disputed city of 
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
----------
The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, described as "complete nonsense" claims from Iran's Supreme Leader 
that "foes of Iran" were behind the anti-government protests that have rocked the country over the past few days. 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said earlier: "The foes of Iran have supplied money and weapons, as well 
as political support, to those fomenting unrest in the last days, with the goal of hurting Iran." The remarks were 
Khamenei's first public reaction to the protests, which have left at least 19 people dead and led to hundreds of 
arrests across the country.
----------
North Korea will restore cross-border communications with South Korea, Seoul's Unification Ministry said, in a sign 
of thawing relations between the bitter rivals. The head of the North Korean agency handling cross-border relations 
said it will open the dialogue channel at the shared border village of Panmunjom in the afternoon, South Korea's 
Yonhap news agency reported. The countries had not used the communications channel since 2016 due to 
increasing tensions over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, a Unification Ministry 
spokeswoman said. South Korean media, citing a North Korean official, also reported that leader Kim Jong Un had 
welcomed Seoul's support for his peace offer.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Passengers have voiced their anger after having to spend the night at Stansted Airport 
after snow and ice forced dozens of Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Up to 300 passengers were waiting in the terminal on Wednesday evening, while images posted on social media 
showed people trying to sleep on seats in the arrivals hall in the early hours of Thursday.
One onlooker said there was "tension" in the terminal as frustrated travellers found themselves facing hours of 
delays "because of a few centimetres of snow".
There were reports of outgoing passengers having to wait for hours to reclaim their luggage after their flights had 
been axed, with some complaining of a "shocking" lack of communication by officials.
Staff are said to have resorted to using pen and paper to communicate with passengers after a hand-written poster 
was put up, pleading: "Please be patient."
Sophia Sleigh was on a New Year's Eve trip to Bulgaria after her Ryanair flight "disappeared" from departure 
screens, leaving her "stranded" at the airport.
She tweeted: "Hundreds of people waiting for baggage from cancelled flights from Stansted Airport! What a 
shambles @Ryanair I feel sorry for the elderly and those with kids. Incredibly stressful and expensive time to travel. 
Next available flights not for DAYS apparently..."
Sleigh said she had waited five hours before being told the flight had been cancelled and she would have to return 
to collect her luggage on Friday.
Airport officials said they would provide beds and blankets for people stuck at the airport, although this was 
disputed by one passenger.
Dozens Of Ryanair , EasyJet Flights Shelved Following Snow And Ice
Lucy Weyinmi tweeted: "Definitely no blankets or food or any support for passengers who have been stuck here for 
8 hours plus...."
She added: "8 hours later, still at #Stansted, waiting to get our luggage back so we can do this all again in 10 hours 
time....Shocking
lack of comms or support from airport or Ryanair..."
Meanwhile arrivals were also hit by long delays.
Joe Allen posted a video of the arrivals lounge packed with people at around 0400 GMT.
He said: "(It is) a little busier than you might expect. Some flights have been delayed up to five hours, the one I am 
waiting for is
currently over five hours delayed and is currently sitting on the tarmac with no staff able to offload it, even though 
it's been due to arrive for five hours which is obviously a little bit frustrating. The tension is quite high, people are 
sleeping here. I guess they have
been here for a while. Not very pleasant because of a few centimetres of snow."
Samir Hussein tweeted: "Stansted Airport a disgrace. Waiting for baggage for 3 hours & still told no idea when it will 
arrive. This follows 4 hour flight delay arriving at Stansted due to small amount of snow. Thousands in the same 
situation in baggage hall."
A London Stansted spokeswoman said on Wednesday: "Due to adverse weather conditions today Ryanair and 
easyjet cancelled a number of flights. There are up to 300 passengers in the terminal waiting to rebook flights.
"Passengers unable to return home are being looked after by Stansted Airport with beds and blankets, and 
additional help for elderly
passengers or those with young children. Free food and drinks have been provided to delayed passengers 
throughout the day.
"All passengers due to travel are advised to check the status of their flights with their airline before travelling to the 
airport."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are called to open marginally higher on Thursday, the FTSE 100 
looking to build on Wednesday's gains as the end of 2017 fast approaches.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 1.52 points higher at 7,622.20 on Thursday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed up 0.4%, or 28.02 points, at 7,620.68 on Wednesday, having hit a new all-time high of 
7,632.71 earlier in Wednesday's session.
The FTSE 250 closed up 0.8%, or 158.97 points, at 20,640.04 on Wednesday, which marked a record high for the 
index of midcap firms.
Amid a quiet day for UK company news, BGEO Group said its real estate subsidiary, m2 Real Estate, has signed its 
first major third-party construction contract, worth USD11.6 million.
m2 has been awarded the contract to construct the shell and core of a new shopping mall and business centre 
located in Tbilisi's Saburtalo district. m2's construction arm plans to carry out construction works over the sixteen 
months following the planned project commencement in January 2018.
Tritax Big Box REIT said it has acquired a national distribution facility at Hickling Road in  Staffordshire, for 
GBP44.3 million, excluding purchaser's costs. The unit is operated and let to Unilever UK.
Purpose-built in 2005 for Unilever and extended in 2012, the facility has a gross internal area of 541,157 square 
feet, extensive parking, and has benefited from significant capital investment.
The property has been acquired with a new 10 year lease, subject to a five yearly upward only rent review indexed 
to the Retail Price Index with a collar and cap in place, Tritax said.

"We are pleased to have acquired our second distribution centre let to the leading globally recognised consumer 
goods company; Unilever. This property plays a key role in Unilever's supply chain and has benefited from 
significant capital investment with a high level of automation," said Colin Godfrey, partner of Tritax.
Meanwhile, passengers have voiced their anger after having to spend the night at Stansted Airport after snow and 
ice forced dozens of Ryanair Holdings and easyJet flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Up to 300 passengers were waiting in the terminal on Wednesday evening, while images posted on social media 
showed people trying to sleep on seats in the arrivals hall in the early hours of Thursday.
In UK data released early Thursday, the Confederation of British Industry said Thursday private sector growth 
picked up in the fourth quarter.
According to the latest growth indicator, the balance of firms reporting a rise in output was positive 19%, compared 
with positive 6% in the three months to November. Looking ahead, the CBI said private sector growth is set to 
return to a more moribund pace of positive 4% over the next three months.
"Private sector firms are enjoying healthy activity levels as we approach the year end, but mediocre expectations for 
growth underline the ongoing challenges facing companies," Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said.
"Persistent cost pressures will ensure that inflation remains at a high level, perpetuating the squeeze on household 
spending, particularly impacting consumer-facing firms and retailers," she said.

Passengers have voiced their anger after having to spend the night at Stansted Airport after snow and ice forced 
dozens of Ryanair Holdings and easyJet flights to be cancelled or delayed. Up to 300 passengers were waiting in 
the terminal on Wednesday evening, while images posted on social media showed people trying to sleep on seats 
in the arrivals hall in the early hours of Thursday. One onlooker said there was "tension" in the terminal as frustrated 
travellers found themselves facing hours of delays "because of a few centimetres of snow". There were reports of 
outgoing passengers having to wait for hours to reclaim their luggage after their flights had been axed, with some 
complaining of a "shocking" lack of communication by officials.

UK mortgage approvals came in below expectations for November, data from UK finance showed, at 39,507. 
Consensus forecasts were for a reading of 40,472, while 40,417 mortgages were approved in October. Moreover, 
the November figure for mortgage approvals marked a 15-month low. The Bank of England early November raised 
interest rates for the first time in ten years, to 0.50% from 0.25%. Gross mortgage borrowing in November was 
GBP13.9 billion, which was 13% higher than in November 2016, while the annual growth in net mortgage borrowing 
came in at 2.8%. Credit card borrowing grew 5.3% versus 5% in October, and personal loans and overdrafts 
dropped 3.1% following a 2.8% drop in October. At the same time, overall consumer credit growth remained at 
0.9%.
----------
Data from the Confederation of British Industry showed the UK private sector growth picked up in the fourth quarter. 
According to the latest growth indicator, the balance of firms reporting a rise in output was +19%, compared with 
+6% in the three months to November. Looking ahead, the CBI said private sector growth is set to return to a more 
moribund pace of +4% over the next three months. "Private sector firms are enjoying healthy activity levels as we 
approach the year end, but mediocre expectations for growth underline the ongoing challenges facing companies," 
Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said. "Persistent cost pressures will ensure that inflation remains at

a high level, perpetuating the squeeze on household spending, particularly impacting consumer-facing firms and 
retailers," she said.
----------
Landlords seeking to rent flats and other smaller properties as house shares face new rules as the UK government 
aims to target "rogue" operators. Ministers are to seek approval from Parliament to widen the criteria for landlords in 
England who need to secure a licence when renting a house in multiple occupation. The Department for 
Communities and Local Government (DCLG) wants those offering a place to five or more people - from two or more 
different families - to be licensed. DCLG says the change will mean flats and one and two-storey properties are now 
subject to licensing, adding it predicts around 160,000 houses will be affected. The maximum number of people 
who can occupy a room should be specified in the licence while the government has brought forward minimum 
bedroom sizes as part of work to deal with overcrowding and poor accommodation. DCLG is also awaiting approval 
from Parliament for regulations it has already tabled in the Commons which outline the offences that will lead to a 
landlord being banned.

Two-thirds of British people surveyed, or 67%, feel that the EU is in a stronger position in the negotiations to 
withdraw Britain from the bloc. Only 10% of the British people asked by pollsters YouGov in results published on 
Wednesday felt that Britain had the upper hand in the negotiations. YouGov surveyed some 8,000 people in seven 
different EU countries between December 13 and 19, asking them one question: "Who do you think has the upper 
hand in the Brexit negotiations?" Possible answers were: Britain, Rest of the EU or Don't know. Almost a quarter of 
Britons, or 23%, did not know. People surveyed in other EU countries also saw the EU in the stronger position: In 
Denmark it was 61% of those asked, in Germany 50% and in both Sweden and Norway 44%.
----------
South Korea's government said it plans to implement special measures to control virtual currency speculation. The 
government has repeatedly warned that virtual currencies are not legal tender and its prices can fluctuate drastically 
causing great losses, the Office for Government Policy Coordination said in a statement. The virtual currency 
speculation has irrationally overheated in Korea, the government said. The government is not in a position to 
neglect these unusual speculation. New measures will require real-name cryptocurrency transactions and plans to 
ban cryptocurrency exchanges deemed necessary, a measure proposed by the Ministry of Justice. 
----------
Industrial output in Japan climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.6% on month in November, the Ministry of Economy, 
Trade and Industry said in a preliminary reading. That beat expectations for an increase of 0.5%, which would have 
been unchanged from the October reading. On a yearly basis, industrial production advanced 3.7% - again beating 
forecasts for 3.6% but down from 5.9% in the previous month. Meanwhile, retail sales in Japan were up a 
seasonally adjusted 1.9% on month in November. That beat forecasts for a gain of 0.7% following the downwardly 
revised 0.1% contraction in October. On a yearly basis, retail sales climbed 2.2% - again topping expectations for a 
gain of 1.0% following the 0.2% slide in the previous month. Sales from large retailers advanced an annual 1.4%, 
exceeding expectations for a gain of 1.0% after dipping 0.7% a month earlier.

A supermarket bombing in St Petersburg was a "terrorist attack," Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday, 
giving authorities the go-ahead to kill suspects if they resist arrest. Several people were injured on Wednesday in 
an explosion at a Perekryostok supermarket in Russia's second largest city. The blast was believed to have been 
caused by a device that contained shrapnel and had the power of about 200 grams of TNT. In comments released 
by the Kremlin, Putin said authorities should "act within the law," but that they should "eliminate the bandits on the 
spot" if there is a threat to their lives. A witness of Wednesday's explosion said it appeared to have come from a 
baggage locker at the supermarket's entrance.
----------
Russia's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in five months in December, driven by accelerated 
growth in output and new orders, survey data from IHS Markit showed. The Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 
52.0 in December from 51.5 in the previous month. That was in line with economists' expectations. Any reading 
above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. Output rose at the sharpest pace in four months in December. Greater 
demand from new and existing clients supported a solid increase in new orders received by Russian goods 
producers. New business growth quickened to a 5-month high, while export sales contracted for the first in four 
months, though marginally. At the same time, employment levels were broadly unchanged in December.

Ryanair Apologizes For Delays After "Unneccessary" Pilots' Strike

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airliner Ryanair Holdings PLC apologized to its customers that one in four 
of its flights had been delayed early Friday, following a four-hour pilots' strike that it referred to as "unneccessary".
The strike, organized by the German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit, lasted from 5 am local time (0400 GMT) to 9 
am, but only a small number of pilots participated, meaning that no flights had to be cancelled and only nine of 36 
were delayed, the airline said.
The action formed part of a long-running dispute over working conditions.
The pilots' decision in Germany came after Ryanair held its first-ever negotiations with unions on Wednesday, 
which helped to avert planned pan-European industrial action by the airline's pilots.
Ryanair shares were trading down 0.2% at EUR15.12 in London on Friday.

BERLIN (Alliance News) - Pilots in Germany employed by budget airline Ryanair Holdings plan to mount the first 
strike in the carrier's more than 30-year corporate history on Friday, just as the group enters the final days of the 
crucial Christmas holiday season.
The pilots plan to hold a warning strike between 5 am and 9 am (0400 and 0800 GMT) on all of the Irish carrier's 
services from German airports.
The action forms part of a long-running dispute over conditions, the pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said on 
Thursday.
"Ryanair continues to play for time and as a result prevents the launch of collective bargaining," said VC negotiator 
Ingolf Schumacher.
The pilots' decision in Germany came after Ryanair held its first-ever negotiations with unions on Wednesday, 
which helped to avert planned pan-European industrial action by the airline's pilots.
Earlier Thursday, Ryanair said it planned to hold more talks with the German union next month.
"Ryanair has written today to the VC union on a number of outstanding issues arising from the meeting in Dublin 
yesterday," the company said in a statement.
It agreed to meet the union in Frankfurt on January 5 to "progress and resolve these issues, which Ryanair expects 
will lead to a collective labour agreement (CLA) for Ryanair's pilots in Germany." 
The Ryanair pilots in Germany said they had wanted to join their counterparts in Ireland, Italy as well as Portugal 
and mount a strike on Wednesday.

However, the group cancelled the strikes after Ryanair's offer to talk about the trade unions' complaints, covering 
areas such as the carrier's strategy as well as pay and employment models in the fast-growing budget airline 
industry.
Ryanair said it had written to the Impact union in Ireland on Thursday to confirm recognition of the union and a joint 
council for Irish pilots.
The airline said it had tabled proposals on pay and conditions, procedures and dispute resolution for Irish-based 
pilots, and "looks forward to concluding an early agreement on these issues with its Irish Ryanair pilot company 
council."
Until Thursday, Ryanair had essentially refused to recognize trade unions as representatives of their employees.
Instead, the low-cost airline, which was founded in 1985, has only held talks with local pilot committees from across 
its European operations.
According to the German pilots' union, Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no 
guaranteed work schedule, no retirement planning and a widely used system of registering pilots as self-employed.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Pilots for Ryanair Holidngs PLC have suspended a pre-Christmas one-day strike, union 
bosses have announced.
Impact, which represents Irish-based pilots, has agreed to meet the London-listed low-cost carrier's management 
on Tuesday evening ahead of the planned strike on Wednesday.
Some 117 directly-employed Ryanair pilots are involved in the dispute, making up the majority of the firm's captains 
in Ireland - meaning any walkout would have severely affected flights.
The dispute is about winning independent representation for pilots in the company, Impact said.
In a statement, Impact said: "Impact has this evening suspended a planned one-day strike of Ryanair pilots next 
Wednesday after company management agreed to recognise the union as the representative of Irish-based pilots.
"The union has agreed to meet management on Tuesday evening, but says it is available to meet sooner.
"The union asked management to release its Ryanair pilot representatives to prepare for and attend the meeting.
"The union acknowledged the principled determination of Ryanair pilots, which it said had made this breakthrough 
possible, and said it looked forward to establishing a positive relationship with Ryanair company management.
"Impact added that it hoped the suspension of industrial action would remove any uncertainty for passengers 
intending to travel on Wednesday."
Impact said the union would make no further comment until after the meeting with Ryanair on Tuesday.
Ryanair said it would recognise unions for the first time as it also faces challenges from staff in Germany, Portugal, 
Britain and Italy.
The firm's chief operations officer, Peter Bellew, said: "Let's keep talking. Get people home quietly for Christmas.

"Union meetings planned next week and January."
It is the only time airline boss Michael O'Leary has extended such an invite to union leaders in the 32 years the 
company has been in business.
In October, O'Leary wrote to his airline's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions after Ryanair was forced to 
cancel thousands of flights.
The carrier admitted it had "messed up" the planning of its pilots' holidays.

LONDON (Alliance News) - While it was no surprise markets reacted badly to the news Ryanair Holdings will now 
recognise pilot unions, Deutsche bank said, the financial fallout from the decision is unlikely to dent the airline's cost 
advantage over budget short-haul peers.
Shares in Ryanair were down 3.3% at EUR14.50 on Monday, having closed down 8.1% on Friday after announcing 
the decision to recognise unions. The budget airline was also cut to Neutral from Outperform by Credit Suisse on 
Monday.
Ryanair agreeing to recognise its pilot unions is "unprecedented" in its history, Deutsche Bank said. The market 
"understandably reacted badly" to this surprise negative announcement, as speculation will be rife as to what this 
may mean for Ryanair's cost base and business model. 
Ryanair on Friday said it will change its long standing policy of not recognising unions, and called upon pilot unions 
to call off threatened industrial action and avoid "widespread customer disruptions" over the Christmas holiday 
period.
The budget airline said it has written to pilot unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal inviting 
them to talks to recognise these unions as the representative body for pilots in Ryanair in each of these countries, 
"as long as they establish Committees of Ryanair pilots to deal with Ryanair issues, as Ryanair will not engage with 
pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or elsewhere".
On Monday, union bosses announced pilots for Ryanair have suspended a pre-Christmas one-day strike. Impact, 
which represents Irish-based pilots, agreed to meet the London-listed low-cost carrier's management on Tuesday 
evening ahead of the planned strike on Wednesday.
Deutsche Bank said in "an immediate very negative scenario", recognising unions could add an EUR150 million in 
costs, representing 4.6% of Ryanair's operating costs per available seat kilometres excluding fuel. This would knock 
9.4% off from the German bank's annual net profit forecast of EUR1.41 billion for 2018.
IN THE KNOW: Deutsche Bank Says Ryanair Attractive Despite Union Costs
The EUR150 million cost, or 8 cents per available seat kilometre, is made up from a 5% decline in pilot productivity, 
costing EUR35,000 per pilot, a EUR3,000 per pilot increase in short-term benefits, and a EUR20,000 rise in social 
security and pension costs per pilot.
Deutsche Bank said there is "a reasonable risk" unions could push for reduced Ryanair pilot hours. Ryanair's pilots 
are currently amongst the most productive in Europe, the bank said, spending an average of 842 hours flying in the 
year ended March 31, close to the regulated maximum of 900 hours per year. 
For reference, Deutsche Bank said easyJet pilots average closer to 800 hours, with typical network carrier pilots in 
the 550 hours to 800 hours range.
Deutsche Bank also said it has already incorporated "substantive" pilot wage increases into forecasts following the 
airline's recent staffing issues.
By 2020, Ryanair's wage bill, under an "aggressive wage inflation scenario", could see pilot salaries rise by 
EUR28,000, or 27%. Deutsche Bank said it feels "reasonably confident" these prior forecasts should already reflect 
the bulk of potential union demands for higher pay.
"Although momentum is likely to be challenging in the near-term, we think the current share price offers a very 
attractive entry point for a business that is fundamentally still a winner, and generates over 75% of profits from 
ancillary revenues rather than fares," said Detusche Bank.
Deutsche Bank noted that the 8 cents increase in costs per available seat kilometre following the decision to 
recognise unions would "barely dent" Ryanair's cost advantage over its major European peers.
"An EUR0.08 increase is clearly not good, but it's also clearly not destroying Ryanair's economics as some bears 
are worried about," said Deutsche Bank.
Deutsche Bank maintained its Buy rating and EUR17.60 price target.

ROME (Alliance News) - Ryanair has taken a "great step change" with its decision to recognize pilots' unions, but is 
not prepared to go further and also recognize flight assistants' unions, a top executive said in a Saturday interview.
"We are not bluffing. [Yesterday] our shares lost 7% on the stock market and therefore we are very serious: for us 
this is a great step change compared to the past and we will not go back," Chief Operating Officer Peter Bellew told 
Italy's La Repubblica daily.
Ryanair's move was announced on Friday, after pilots' unions in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal 
threatened unprecedented industrial action in the run-up to the Christmas holidays against unsatisfactory working 
conditions.
Bellew, whose predecessor resigned in October amid flight cancellations chaos forced by pilot shortages, said the 
budget airline opted for "dialogue" because it did not "want to put at risk [its] customers' Christmas."
He said that talks with pilots' unions would start next week, or in January at the latest, in all of Ryanair's European 
hubs, but he also said the company was not prepared to extend talks to flight assistants, who also demand union 
recognition.
"We are only talking to pilots," Bellew said.
According to the German pilots' union, Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no 
obligatory work schedule, no retirement planning and a widely prevalent system of pseudo-self-employed pilots.
In the La Repubblica interview, Bellew insisted that self-employed pilots only make up 24% of Ryanair's total.

"Recognising unions will be a significant change for Ryanair, but we have delivered radical change before," O'Leary

Shares in Ryanair were down 0.6% at EUR16.30 shortly after the market open Friday.

Ryanair Holdings said it will change its long standing policy of not recognising unions, and called upon pilot unions 
to call off threatened industrial action and avoid "widespread customer disruptions" over the Christmas holiday 
period. The budget airline said it has written to pilot unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal 
inviting them to talks to recognise these unions as the representative body for pilots in Ryanair in each of these 
countries, "as long as they establish Committees of Ryanair pilots to deal with Ryanair issues, as Ryanair will not 
engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or elsewhere". Ryanair has called on these unions to call 
off the threatened strikes on December 20.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will continue meetings in Brussels while the European Council meeting of EU 
heads of state concludes. EU leaders are expects to give the go-ahead for Brexit talks to move on from settling the 
terms of Britain's departure from the EU to shaping future relations, at a two-day summit in Brussels that began 
Thursday. But May's arrival on Thursday was overshadowed by a vote in parliament late Wednesday, in which 
rebels from her Conservative party backed a motion giving lawmakers a final say on the EU Withdrawal Bill, a key 
legal text which will incorporate EU rules into British law.
----------
May has made clear she will not be deflected from delivering Brexit by her humiliating defeat at the hands of Tory 
rebels in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister told leaders of the remaining 27 EU states at a summit in 
Brussels that the UK remains committed to a smooth and orderly withdrawal and that she is personally keen to start 
discussions on building a close and friendly future relationship as soon as possible. Her comments came as 
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the setback would not "for one second" stop the Brexit process being 
completed in a "very successful and very timely way". "I can't believe for the life of me that Parliament will actually 
vote to stop or reverse the Brexit process or frustrate the will of the British people," said Johnson at a press 
conference in London. "That's just not going to happen".
----------
Japan on Friday stepped up its economic sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes. 
Tokyo said it will freeze the assets of 19 additional North Korean firms working in the finance, oil and coal sectors, 
the Japanese foreign ministry announced. A government spokesman said the fresh sanctions are in reaction to

North Korea's recent test of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile. Following the missile test at the end of 
November, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed to maximize pressure on North Korea.
----------
The EU's position on Jerusalem is "unchanged," one of the bloc's top officials said during a summit of EU leaders, 
following the controversial US decision to recognize the city as the capital of Israel. "EU leaders reiterate firm 
commitment to the two-state solution and, in this context, the EU position on Jerusalem remains unchanged," 
European Council President Donald Tusk wrote on Twitter late Thursday. The two-state solution foresees the 
existence of an Israeli and a Palestinian state with the final status of Jerusalem as the shared capital to be finalized 
in direct talks. US President Donald Trump sparked a diplomatic firestorm last week when he declared Jerusalem 
the Israeli capital and decided to move the country's embassy there, upending decades of US policy.
----------
Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed North Korea by phone Thursday, the White House 
confirmed. Trump thanked President Putin for acknowledging America's strong economic performance in his annual 
press conference, according to a statement issued by the White House press office. "The two presidents also 
discussed working together to resolve the very dangerous situation in North Korea," the statement said. The 
Russian news agency TASS also said the crisis in North Korea was discussed among other topics. The call was 
placed by Trump, TASS said.
----------
EU leaders have clashed over the migrant crisis at talks in Brussels which stretched into the early hours of Friday, 
with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying positions had not budged. The discussion on the first day of a two-
day summit was meant to re-energize efforts to solve the EU's migration crisis, which has led to deep divisions 
inside the bloc since the situation peaked in 2015. "Here we have a huge amount of work to do and the positions 
have not changed," Merkel said. "However, there is a clear mandate to continue working until June next year." 
Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern echoed Merkel's comments. "There is still no overall convergence - to put it in a 
friendly way," Kern said. "This is a huge topic that concerns Germany, that concerns Austria, that concerns Italy and 
Greece."
----------
EU leaders on Thursday extended economic sanctions against Russia for six months over the country's role in the 
Ukraine conflict. "EU united on roll-over of economic sanctions on Russia," European Council President Donald 
Tusk posted on Twitter. The sanctions were first adopted in July 2014 after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's 
Crimea peninsula and its support for separatists in the country's east.
The EU has tied easing the sanctions to Russia implementing the Minsk peace agreement, which calls for an 
unconditional ceasefire and for both sides to pull heavy weapons from the frontline in eastern Ukraine. After the 
summit, Merkel said that the sanction extension was debated "intensely" though there was overall support for it. 
She said that while "escalation" was avoided, there had not been enough progress to justify a lifting of the sanctions 
and it was agreed that more needed to be done to kick start the Minsk agreement. The restrictive measures target 
the financial, energy and defence industries, impeding Russian banks' access to EU markets and limiting Russian 
access to certain EU imports.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks were mostly lower in the mid-market trading 
Friday, weighed down by retailers H&M and Ferragamo with their weak trading updates. Investors are also 
concerned of uncertainty about the outlook for US tax reform plan and as they assess messages from the Federal 
Reserve and European Central Bank meetings.
Senator Marco Rubio, R-Fla., indicated his opposition to the legislation currently being negotiated.
On a positive note, data showed an unexpected increase in US retail sales and a drop in jobless claims.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index traded down 1.67 points or 0.43% to 387.24.
France's CAC 40 index traded down 22.48 points or 0.42% to 5,334.66.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100, UK's benchmark for blue-chip stocks, traded up 5.91 points or 0.08% at 7,454.03, 
erasing early losses.
In corporate news, Hennes & Mauritz AB or H&M were plunging around 15% after the Swedish retailer reported 
weak sales in its fourth quarter. The second largest fashion retailer's results were hurt by fewer shoppers visiting its 
stores.
Italian luxury goods company Ferragamo fell around 7% after it said it could not confirm earlier set three-year 
targets and that 2018 would be another year of transition.
Ryanair Holdings PLC were down 3% after it said the airline has invited pilot unions for talks to recognise them and 
that it will now change the long standing policy of not recognising unions in order to avoid any threat of disruption to 
its flights during Christmas week.

Further, CropEnergies's shares were down 6% after reporting weak operating profit in its third quarter.
However, cement giant LafargeHolcim's shares were gaining around 3% after it said its executive committee will be 
reduced to 9 members. The company said the 30 largest country organizations will directly report to the Executive 
Committee and the global business functions will be merged under one leadership.

London/FRANKFURT (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC faces the prospect of Europe-
wide pilot strikes for the first time in the company's history.
The German pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, said Tuesday the walkouts would take place in the airline's 10 
German hubs without naming exact dates. Passengers would be informed ahead of time and spared labour action 
during the Christmas holidays of December 23-26, VC President Ilja Schulz said in Frankfurt.
Unions in Portugal and Italy called for strikes earlier in the day, with Ryanair pilots in Italy threatening to walk off the 
job for four hours on Friday.
The Irish Airline Pilots' Association said Tuesday that a 24-hour strike involving dozens of Ryanair pilots would take 
place on December 20. It cited Ryanair's refusal to enter into direct negotiations with the European Employee 
Representative Council or IALPA as the sole representative body for pilots at the company.
The unions in Italy, Portugal and Ireland accuse Ryanair, founded in 1985, of operating with unsatisfactory working 
conditions under Irish law for around 4,000 pilots.
Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no obligatory work schedule, no retirement 
planning, and a widely prevalent system of pseudo self-employed pilots, VC's Schulz charged.
Ryanair categorically rejected negotiations with the IALPA and the VC despite the threat of strikes.

BERLIN (Alliance News) - Pilots employed by Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC in Germany plan to join 
their counterparts in other parts of Europe and launch industrial action just as the aviation industry gears up the

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC pilots in Dublin are to take strike action in a bid to win union 
recognition and better working conditions, the BBC reported on Tuesday.
The BBC said 79 pilots, around 28% of its Dublin-based captains, will strike for the whole of December 20, 
disrupting passenger's Christmas travel plans. 
Irish pilots' union Impact said the dispute was solely about winning independent representation for pilots in the 
company, according to the BBC, with Ryanair continuing in a policy of not recognising unions.
Colleagues in Germany, Italy, and Portugal are also planning strike action, though pilots in Germany have promised 
not to take any action which would disrupt Christmas travel. 
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.1% at EUR16.88.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - The European Commission has approved the takeover of certain assets from the 
insolvent airline Air Berlin by the British low-cost carrier Easyjet PLC.
The commissioner in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said Tuesday that Easyjet's plans will not 
reduce competition.
"Our decision enables Easyjet to grow its presence at Berlin airports and start competing on new routes to the 
benefit of consumers," Vestager said.
Easyjet's move to expand its German services follows Air Berlin's collapse in August, which subsequently freed up 
airport landing slots.
Easyjet proposed to acquire certain assets and rights held by Air Berlin as part of its previous operations at Berlin 
Tegel airport, including landing and take-off permission at a specific date and time at Tegel airport and at some 
destination airports, according to an EU statement.
The commission investigation concluded that Easyjet will continue to face strong competition from large carriers like 
Lufthansa AG and Ryanair Holdings PLC on routes from and to Berlin.
Shares in Easyjet were down 0.1% at 1,438.00 pence Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Reuters reported on Thursday Ryanair Holdings PLC is pressing the European 
Commission to make available take-off and landing slots in Germany left open by the failure of Air Berlin.
The Commission, it said, has extended a deadline for examining Lufthansa's planned acquisition of Air Berlin 
subsidiaries Niki and LGW over concerns about Lufthansa' potential dominance in Germany.
The Irish carrier's Chief Operating Officer David O'Brien told Reuters the airline believed regulatory authorities 
should ensure "sufficient" slots from Air Berlin should be made to Ryanair.
Ryanair did not enter bidding for the Air Berlin assets, Reuters said, but rival easyJet PLC is to start new German 
domestic routes after buying Air Berlin's operations at Berlin Tegel airport.
O'Brien is reported to have said Ryanair could station ten aircraft at Munich, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, and Berlin Tegel 
within a year and would look at domestic routes, though international destinations would be more likely.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Wednesday it will cut the pay and conditions of pilots if 
members of the Italian trade union ANPAC vote for industrial action, Reuters reported on Wednesday.  
ANPAC said a planned strike on December 15 - Friday next week - will last for four hours, and is one of several 
unions across Europe planning industrial action over demands for better conditions and an overhaul of Ryanair's 
collective bargaining system, Reuters said. 
Ryanair has never experienced a pilot strike. Reuters said a spokesman claimed the company does not expect 
Italian pilots to actually take action, with ANPAC and other Italian unions already cancelling six planned strikes. 
The airline sent a memo to Dublin pilots on Wednesday saying it would freeze promotions, cut cash allowances, 
and possibly move pilots if staff working out of the city support industrial action. 
Reuters said ANPAC represents around 280 of Ryanair's approximate 4,000 pilots, with 40% based in Italy.

ROME (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair  Holdings PLC risks a fine of up to EUR5 million for failing to 
properly inform customers hit by flight cancellations, Italy's antitrust regulator said Monday.
In September, Ryanair attracted widespread criticism as it was forced to cancel tens of thousands of flights to 
accommodate a backlog of holidays for pilots.
Italy's competition authority AGCM said it ordered the airline to clearly advertise to Italian customers affected by the 
cancellations the options available to them.
In such cases, passengers have a right to obtain refunds or be booked onto another flight for free, but may also 
claim financial compensation, the regulator recalled in a statement.
Since Ryanair did not meet a 10-day deadline to tell AGCM how it was going to comply with the regulator's October 
25 order, an infringement procedure against the airline was opened.
"The infringement procedure that was started can lead to the application of an administrative sanction ranging from 
EUR10,000 to EUR5 million," AGCM said.
Earlier Monday, Ryanair said it carried 5.6% more passengers in November than in the year-earlier month, as its 
load factor also improved.
Ryanair said it carried 9.3 million customers last month, up from 8.8 million in November 2016, raising its rolling 
annual traffic total to 128.7 million passengers, up 11% on a year before.
The increase came as Ryanair's load factor improved to 96% in November from 95% a year before.
Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs attributed the increases to the airline's lower fares. "Ryanair customers can 
look forward to even lower fares when they make advance bookings for winter or summer," he said.

Ryanair shares were up 1.2% on Monday at 17.66 pence.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Rio Tinto appointed Non-Executive Director Simon Thompson as its new chairman, effective from March 5 next 
year. Thompson will succeed outgoing Chairman Jan du Plessis, who will leave on the same date after stepping 
down in March to join BT Group as chairman, having served Rio Tinto for almost nine years. Thompson, a former 
Anglo American executive, has over 20 years' experience of the mining and metals industry, Rio noted. He is 
currently chairman of private equity firm 3i Group and was chairman of Tullow Oil between 2012 and this year. 
Former Xstrata boss Mick Davis had emerged as a frontrunner for the role, with other candidates including former 
Centrica Chief Executive Sam Laidlaw, who is currently on Rio Tinto's board and will become head of its 
remuneration committee. 
----------
Ryanair Holdings said it carried 5.6% more passengers in November than in the year-earlier month, as its load 
factor also improved. The Irish budget airline said it carried 9.3 million customers last month, up from 8.8 million in 
November 2016, raising its rolling annual traffic total to 128.7 million passengers, up 11% on a year before. The 
increase came as Ryanair's load factor improved to 96% in November from 95% a year before.
----------
Transport operator National Express Group said it continued to enjoy positive trading across all of its divisions 
during October and November and that it completed two small acquisitions in November. National Express acquired 
a school bus and coach business with 204 vehicles, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and a bus operator in Madrid, Spain 
with 73 vehicles. The group said it expects the acquisitions to deliver 15% to 20% returns from these two 
acquisition. "We are encouraged by strong early Christmas trading in both our UK and Spanish coach businesses, 
with advanced sales higher than last year," National Express said.

Euromoney Institutional Investor said it has acquired information and events business Seven Site Media Ltd, which 
trades as TowerXchange, for an undisclosed sum. The financial magazine publisher and events organiser said it 
acquired TowerXchange as part of the company's telecoms strategy to "facilitate industry collaboration" and trading 
in areas ranging from pricing to standards across the telecoms ecosystem.
----------
Walt Disney has re-engaged in discussions with Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox to purchase some of 
the media giant's assets, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. Comcast, the US 
cable group that owns NBCUniversal, and Verizon, the telecoms operator, have also expressed interest in Fox's 
entertainment assets and buying businesses, the newspaper noted. The talks centre on the Twentieth Century Fox 
movie and television studio, international assets such as Fox's 39% holding in UK satellite TV provider Sky and 
India's Star TV, along with some US cable networks, WSJ reported. Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and 
sports network FS1 aren't expected to be sold in any transaction, the report said.
----------
Drugstore giant CVS Health agreed to buy health care benefit company Aetna for about USD69 billion in cash and 
stock. Including the assumption of Aetna's debt, the total value is USD77 billion. The proposed merger is expected 
to shake up the US healthcare industry, which is facing potential competition from Amazon. According to CVS, the 
deal will provide a uniquely integrated, community-based health care experience for its customers. The combined 
company will also be able to better understand patients' health goals, guide them through the health care system, 
and help them achieve their best health. Under the terms of the merger deal, Aetna shareholders will receive 
USD145 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. The transaction values Aetna at 
approximately USD207 per share, versus its closing price in New York on Friday of USD181.31. Following the deal 
closure, Aetna shareholders will own approximately 22% of the combined company, while CVS Health shareholders 
will own approximately 78%.

MARKETS
----------
Optimism about both US tax reform and the UK's Brexit negotiations with the EU were pushing up London stock 
prices, while Wall Street was called higher, with key indices pointed up 0.4% to 0.8%. The dollar was on the rise, 
depressing gold prices.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The Irish government has made clear that the border issue remains unresolved ahead of a crunch round of Brexit 
talks involving UK Prime Minister Theresa May and key EU figures. Deputy Premier & Foreign Affairs Minister 
Simon Coveney insisted his administration would hold firm on its need for a written assurance from the UK that 
there would be no hardening of the border post-Brexit. He said some progress on the form of text had been made 
since last Thursday and expressed hope that an agreement could be reached on Monday, but he stressed there 
was still a distance to travel. May will meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald 
Tusk, the president of the European Council, later on Monday for negotiations that could have a crucial bearing on 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Rio Tinto Picks Ex-Anglo American Exec As New Chair
whether she is able to secure an overall Brexit deal. While the two sides appear to be moving closer on the UK's 
divorce bill and future citizens' rights, it is unclear whether they can bridge the gap on the Irish border - the third 
area where Brussels is demanding progress.
----------
British construction activity expanded at the fastest pace in five months in November, driven by solid rise in 
residential building work, survey data from IHS Markit showed. The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & 
Supply construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.1 in November from 50.8 in October. Any reading 
above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. "Business optimism across the construction sector remained relatively 
subdued, but picked up from the near five-year low seen in October," said Tim Moore, associate director at IHS 
Markit.
----------
Eurozone producer price inflation eased at a faster-than-expected pace in October, data from Eurostat showed. 
Producer prices climbed 2.5% year-over-year in October, slower than previous month's 2.8% rise, which was 
revised down from a 2.9% increase reported earlier. Economists had expected the PPI inflation to moderate to 
2.6%. Meanwhile, eurozone investor confidence declined in December on weak expectations, survey results from 
think tank Sentix showed. The investor sentiment index fell more-than-expected to 31.1 from 34.0 in November. 
The score was forecast to fall to 33.6.
----------
US President Donald Trump claimed Sunday that he never asked former FBI director James Comey to end a probe 
of former national security advisor Michael Flynn, as the president blasted the agency's handling of the 
investigation. "I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!" 
Trump tweeted, two days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, turning attention back to questions about 
Trump's dealings with Flynn and the FBI. Flynn emerged at the centre of an investigation by special counsel Robert 
Mueller into Russian interference in the US presidential election last year and into whether Trump's campaign may 
have colluded with the Russians. Flynn is cooperating with prosecutors. Trump said Saturday he "had to fire" Flynn 
for lying to his administration and the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential 
transition. That missive raised questions about whether Trump knew of Flynn's misconduct in relation to the FBI 
when Flynn was forced to step down.
----------
Republicans passed a USD1.5 trillion tax reform bill through the US Senate early Saturday after a long night of 
debate and amendments, handing Trump his first major legislative victory. The 51-49 vote came after minority 
Democrats complained bitterly that the tax reforms benefited wealthy taxpayers at the expense of middle income 
families. Republican Senator Bob Corker was the only lawmaker to vote against his party's line - more than two 
Republican dissenters would have sunk the bill. The bill, which represents the biggest tax reform in three decades, 
must now be reconciled with a version that passed the House of Representatives and then returned to both 
chambers for passage before being forwarded to Trump for his signature.
----------
Jordan warned Trump of "dangerous consequences" if he recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, amid 
speculation that such a move could come this week. Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said he had raised the 
matter with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. "Such a decision would trigger anger across Arab Muslim worlds, 
fuel tension & jeopardize peace efforts," he wrote on Twitter. Earlier on Sunday, Trump's adviser and son-in-law 
Jared Kushner, who has been tasked with leading US efforts to negotiate peace between Israel and the 
Palestinians, said the president had not yet made his mind up on the move.
----------
The Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers is due Monday to select its next president, with four of them vying to 
take over from incumbent Jeroen Dijsselbloem next month. The influential panel of eurozone finance ministers is 
responsible for charting the economic course of the 19-country currency area. In recent years it has agreed behind 
closed doors to huge bailout programmes for crisis-hit countries such as Greece. Dijsselbloem, the former Dutch 
finance minister, has presided over the group since 2013. His term ends on January 13. The candidates to succeed 
him are Portuguese Finance Minister Mario Centeno, Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, their 
Slovakian counterpart Peter Kazimir and Latvia's Dana Reizniece-Ozola.

Holiday Scheduling Leaves American Airlines With Too Few Pilots

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - American Airlines has granted leave to too many of its pilots over the Christmas 
holiday period, putting thousands of flights in danger of being cancelled, the union for the airline's pilots said on 
Wednesday.
The Allied Pilots Association said in a statement it has filed a grievance over the pilot scheduling problem, which it 
said the airline disclosed on Friday.
It said the airline updated the situation on Wednesday, detailing the "significant holes" in the operation and 
"unilaterally invoked a solution for crewing affected flights".
The union estimated 15,000 flights scheduled from December 17 to 31 will be affected, according to the Dallas 
Morning News.
An American Airlines spokesman declined to say how many potential flights could be affected. Matt Miller was 
quoted by the Dallas newspaper as saying the airline expects to correct the problem and avoid cancellations.
Pilots are being offered 150% of their normal hourly wage to pick up some of the flights, Miller said.
The union, which represents 15,000 pilots, said management "unilaterally created their solution in violation of the 
contract," meaning neither the union nor the contract itself is a guarantee that the promised premium will be paid.
The problems for American Airlines are an echo of the 2,100 flight cancellations that Ryanair Holdings PLC was 
forced to make in Europe in September and October, followed by a reduction of its winter flying schedule, after what 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary called a  "material failure" in its pilot rostering.

LONDON (Alliance News) - A trade union of German pilots has told its members that industrial action against 
Ryanair Holdings PLC is likely to be needed to force the Irish low-cost airlines management to overhaul the way its 
negotiates with its staff, Reuters reported on Friday.
The Vereinigung Cockpit union - which claims over half of Ryanair's pilots working from Germany are members - 
said in a memo sent to pilots and seen by Reuters that it hoped it would not be necessary to take strike action. 
However, the note argued, "realistically it probably will be, first to begin negotiations and later if the negotiation 
stalls."
At present, Ryanair does not recognise trade unions. Instead it negotiates directly with pilots using an internal 
collective bargaining system which it claims is recognised by Irish law.
Ryanair responded to the memo by saying "these German union claims are without foundation," Reuters reported.
Reuters reported that the airline added: "Ryanair and its pilots are continuing to use its collective bargaining 
procedures while German pilot unions waste their time issuing press releases."
The union has set up a company council composed of Ryanair pilots and one lawyer. This, Reuters explained, is 
what is legally required before a strike can be legally called. The union said it had asked the airline to start talks on 
a new labour agreement but had been rebuffed by Ryanair.
The European Employee Representative Council also suggested that industrial action may be necessary. The 
EERC is a pan-European pilots group founded by Ryanair pilots after the company cancelled around 20,000 flights 
in September.
Ryanair has said it will negotiate with the EERC. The EERC has called on pilots across Europe to join unions. 
Several other European pilot unions have announced the creation of a company council.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Royal Dutch Shell third-quarter results showed a huge improvement from last year, as expected, helping earnings 
in the first nine months of the year more than triple, but the oil major's shares struggled to gain ground as investors 
noticed that operational cashflow eased for the first time in almost two years. The largest London-listed company 
said current cost of supply earnings in the third quarter of 2017 amounted to USD3.69 billion, up from just USD1.44 
billion the year before. The rise on an adjusted basis that strips out exceptional items rose at a lesser rate, but was 
still 47% higher at USD4.10 billion from USD2.79 billion. "Earnings benefited mainly from stronger refining and 
chemicals industry conditions, increased realised oil and gas prices and higher production from new fields, 
offsetting the impact of field declines and divestments," Shell said. 
----------
BT Group maintained its interim dividend on Thursday as it also stuck to its full-year outlook after in-line half year 
trading, despite challenges in its enterprise units. For the six months ended September 30, pretax profit fell 22% to 
GBP1.08 billion from GBP1.39 billion the year prior. Revenue was broadly flat at GBP11.79 billion. Despite this the 
telecommunications firm said trading was "in line" and retained its full-year outlook of "broadly flat" underlying 
revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of between GBP7.5 billion and 
GBP7.6 billion and a "progressive" dividend. BT kept its interim dividend flat at 4.85 pence per share.
----------
Ryanair Holdings reported a rise in customer traffic and load factor in October, despite the flight cancellations it was 
forced to make in September. Ryanair reported an 8% rise in customers to 11.8 million in October compared to 10.9 
million the prior year, with load factor up 1 percentage point to 96% from 95% year-on-year.

Ingredients supplier Tate & Lyle shares rose after the company lifted its annual profit guidance on a strong 
performance in the first half of its financial year. Tate said it now expects, after a strong performance in the first half, 
underlying adjusted pretax profit to be "modestly" higher than previously anticipated. The company's sales for the 
half, which ended September 30, rose 6.0% to GBP1.40 billion from GBP1.32 billion the prior year, whilst statutory 
pretax profit rose 26% to GBP161.0 million from GBP128.0 million. Tate said it has approved a 2.4% rise in the 
interim dividend to 8.40 pence from 8.20p, reflecting its confidence in the business.
----------
RSA Insurance Group said its net internet premiums increased overall in the third quarter of 2017, and its profit in 
the year to date was ahead of the year before, despite underwriting results in the quarter. The general insurer 
reported its net written premiums for the nine months to September 30 across its entire operations were up 8.0% 
year-on-year at GBP5.08 billion from GBP4.82 billion for the same period the year before. RSA said its earnings per 
share for the year to date is "ahead of 2016", however the group noted that it was held back by underwriting results. 
----------
Lancashire Holdings turned to a loss in the third quarter as a result of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which 
swept across the US and Puerto Rico in the period, as well as an earthquake in Mexico. Gross premiums written 
amounted to USD143.0 million in the period, up 32% from USD108.2 million a year earlier. Net premiums written 
were 15% higher year-on-year at USD106.1 million in the third quarter. Pretax loss for the three months to 
September 30 was USD136.4 million, compared to a profit of USD42.9 million a year earlier. As a result of the 
natural disasters in the third quarter - including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as an earthquake in 
Mexico City - Lancashire's net loss ratio for the third quarter of 2017 was 175.4% compared to 25.3% for the same 
period in 2016.
----------
WM Morrison Supermarkets said sales grew for its third quarter year-on-year, but showed a slowdown from the 
previous two periods of its current financial year. Total sales excluding fuel for the company rose 2.3% year-on-year 
for the quarter, which ended October 29, whilst including fuel sales rose 3.2%. Morrisons' like-for-like sales 
excluding fuel were up 2.5% on the same period last year and including fuel 3.4%. This included 2.1% revenue 
growth in the retail sector and 0.4% growth in wholesale. The company said like-for-like transactions were up 2.1% 
as it drew in more customers. However, the like-for-like sales growth figure excluding fuel of 2.5% was lower than 
the second quarter figure of 2.6% and the first quarter growth recorded of 3.4%. Including fuel, the 3.4% figure fell 
from 4.1% growth in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first.
----------
Playtech said its full-year results are now expected to be below market consensus after tough trading conditions in 
Asia and underperformance from its Sun Bingo unit. Although the Gaming division continues to perform well, the 
firm said its Sun Bingo contract remains "challenging" due to lengthier seasonality and the re-launch of the new Sun 
Bingo site. Playtech signed a five-year contract with News UK to operate the Sun Bingo and Fabulous Bingo 
websites and mobile services in 2015. In addition, Playtech said trading has been hit by "recent changing market 
conditions" in "certain parts" of Asia.
----------
Intu Properties said it formed a partnership with LaSalle Investment Management to jointly own the Intu Chapelfield 
shopping centre in Norwich, and reported strong tenant demand in the third quarter of 2017. The property group 
said it is acting on behalf of Greater Manchester Pension Fund and West Yorkshire Pension Fund, and LaSalle will 
acquire a 50% stake in the property for GBP148 million, representing a net initial yield of 5.0%, in line with the 
valuation of GBP296.0 million as at December 31.
----------
Randgold Resources said said its third quarter results were lower than second quarter, but added it remains well-
positioned to achieve the top end of its full-year production guidance. The large-cap gold miner produced 310,618 
ounces of gold in the three months to September 30, down 9% on the prior quarter while total cost per ounce rose 
by 17% to USD667.
----------
Acacia Mining said Chief Executive Office Brad Gordon and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Wray have separately 
notified the company of plans to resign from their positions. Both will remain with the company until the end of the 
year to ensure a smooth transition, Acacia said. Gordon plans to return to Australia for family reasons, whilst Wray 
is pursuing an opportunity elsewhere. It has appointed Peter Geleta, currently head of organisation effectiveness,

as interim chief executive officer, and Jaco Maritz, currently general manager of finance as chief financial officer, 
both effective from the start of 2018.
----------
Facebook posted big gains in profit as the company continues to face scrutiny over misleading content paid for by 
Russia-based operations during last year's US presidential election. The social media giant said Wednesday it 
earned USD4.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 79% over the same quarter last year. Total revenue was 
up in the three months ending September 30 to USD10.3 billion, a 47% increase. The results were posted as 
representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google are questioned by US senators this week in Washington over 
online content paid for by Russia-based operations. In Wednesday's results announcement, the California-based 
company said it had earned USD10.1 billion from advertisements during the quarter.
----------
Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse Group reported that its third-quarter net income attributable to shareholders 
surged to CHF244 million from last year's CHF41 million, and earnings per share jumped to CHF0.09 from 
CHF0.02. Reported pretax income rose 80% to CHF400 million, and adjusted pre-tax income surged 90% to 
CHF620 million. Total operating expenses declined 11% compared to last year, reflecting lower general and 
administrative expenses and restructuring expenses. Net revenue for the third quarter, however, slid 8% to 
CHF4.972 billion, and adjusted net revenue were down 2% to CHF5 billion. The decrease in revenue primarily 
reflect lower net revenues in Swiss Universal Bank and Global Markets and increased negative net revenues in the 
Strategic Resolution Unit.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will have to appoint a new Defence Secretary after Michael Fallon became the first 
ministerial head to roll in the Westminster sleaze scandal. Fallon quit after admitting that his behaviour had "fallen 
below the high standards required" in the role and acknowledging that what might have been acceptable in the past 
was no longer appropriate. The resignation leaves the prime minister facing a reshuffle and deprives her of one of 
her most experienced and trusted colleagues. Fallon's shock announcement came after it emerged he had 
repeatedly put his hand on a journalist's knee at a dinner in 2002.
----------
British construction activity signalled a marginal upturn in October, driven by solid rise in residential building work, 
survey data from IHS Markit showed. The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction 
Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.8 in October from 48.1 in September. Economists had expected the index 
to improve to 48.5. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a score below 50 suggests contraction in the 
sector.

The Bank of England is widely expected to lift its key rate for the first time in a decade despite Brexit uncertainties, 
as inflation continues its upward trend on a weaker pound and the growth momentum looks set to run out of steam 
in coming months. The Monetary Policy Committee, headed by Governor Mark Carney, is forecast to raise the 
benchmark rate by 25 basis point to 0.50%. The decision is unlikely to be unanimous. The previous change in the 
rate was a quarter-point reduction in August 2016 after the Brexit vote.
----------
The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on the eve of US President Donald Trump's 
expected announcement of his choice to lead the US central bank. The Fed's monetary policy committee said the 
key rate for overnight loans to banks would stay in a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. In a statement, the Fed said 
that core inflation - excluding volatile food and energy prices - "remained soft". Inflation has remained persistently 
below the Fed's 2.00% target, even as the benchmark interest rate has been hiked by 1 percentage point since 
December 2015.
----------
Trump is expected to nominate Jay Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, the Financial Times reported. 
The newspaper said according to two White House officials an announcement will be made Thursday, ending 
months of speculation ahead of the end of Janet Yellen's term in February. The FT said Powell is a centrist on 
monetary policy, known as pragmatic and down-to-earth, with both private sector and government experience.
----------
Trump called for the death penalty for the suspect accused of a deadly New York terrorist attack, as the 29-year-old 
appeared in one of the city's courts in a wheelchair. The hearing came after terrorism charges were filed against 
Sayfullo Saipov, the man accused of driving a vehicle into pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path in Manhattan on 
Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring 12. The Uzbek national, who came to the US in March 2010 and is a legal 
permanent resident, was charged with providing material support or resources to extremist militia group Islamic 
State, according to New York court documents.
----------
Several members of Catalonia's deposed regional government have arrived at the National Court in Madrid to face 
questioning on possible charges of rebellion, sedition and misappropriation of funds. Former vice president Oriol 
Junqueras was the first to arrive, followed later by other sacked colleagues, including regional government 
spokesman Jordi Turull, external affairs minister Raul Romeva and interior minister Joaquim Forn. Catalonia's ex-
president Carles Puigdemont, who flew to Brussels on Monday, did not appear in court with his former colleagues. 
His lawyer said on Wednesday he would not return to Spain.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday reported a rise in customer traffic and load factor in 
October, despite the flight cancellations it was forced to make in September.
Ryanair reported an 8% rise in customers to 11.8 million in October compared to 10.9 million the prior year, with 
load factor up 1 percentage point to 96% from 95% year-on-year.
Rolling annual traffic to October grew 12% to 128.2 million, Ryanair said.
"Ryanair's October traffic grew by 8% to 11.8 million customers, while our load factor jumped 1% to 96%, on the 
back of lower fares. These figures include the flight cancellations announced in September. Ryanair customers can 
look forward to even lower fares when they make advance bookings for winter or summer, so there's never been a 
better time to book a low fare flight on Ryanair," said Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs in a statement.
Shares in Ryanair were up 0.4% at EUR17.43 on Thursday, shortly after the market open.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks are likely to open higher on Wednesday amid 
optimism over global growth after a gauge of US consumer confidence jumped to a near 17-year high in October 
and a private survey signaled improvement in manufacturing operating conditions across China.
The US Federal Reserve announces its monetary policy decision later today. While no policy changes are 
expected, investors may get some clues in the policy statement as to whether the US central bank is on track to 
raise rates in December.
The Bank of England will reveal its interest-rate decision on Thursday, with traders bracing for what could be the 
central bank's first rate increase in more than a decade.
According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the BoE is set to lift the policy rate by 25 basis 
points this month and again every six months until it reaches 2%.
Across the Atlantic, US President Donald Trump plans to announce his nominee as the next Fed Chair on 
Thursday. Media reports suggest that Trump intends to nominate Fed Governor Jerome Powell to replace current 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen.
The closely watched monthly jobs report due to be released on Friday is also likely to be in focus, with employment 
expected to jump by 300,000 jobs in October.
Meanwhile, data released earlier in the day showed that UK shop price deflation remained at a four-year low in 
October. The BRC-Nielsen shop price index dropped 0.1%, the same annual rate as seen in September.
Asian stocks are broadly higher and Brent oil prices hovered near two-year highs while the dollar gained ground 
ahead of the FOMC decision. The China Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI for October came in unchanged at 51.0, 
easing concerns of a slowdown.
European Shares Seen Up On Growth Optimism
US stocks rose overnight, driven by food companies as Kellogg and Mondelez reported better than expected third-
quarter results and upbeat consumer confidence data strengthened optimism about the economy.
The Dow and the S&P 500 inched up around 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4% to reach a fresh 
record closing high.
European markets also advanced on Tuesday, with well-received earnings updates from the likes of BP and 
Ryanair as well as polls suggesting rising support for Spanish unity in Catalonia helping underpin investor 
sentiment.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.3% to end at more-than-five-month high. France's CAC 40 index 
gained 0.2% and the UK's FTSE 100 inched up 0.1% while the German market was closed for the Reformation Day 
holiday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Tuesday its revenue and profit expanded in the first half 
despite pilot rostering issues, and against the backdrop of a spate of collapses amongst its peers.
For the six months ended September 30, pretax profit expanded 10% to EUR1.45 billion from EUR1.31 billion the 
year prior. Total operating revenue grew 7% to EUR4.43 billion from EUR4.13 billion the year before.  
Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said that the results were "strong" despite its "material failure" in its 
pilot rostering in early September. Prior to this, O'Leary added, the Irish budget airline was "on track" to deliver 
strong half year results.  
O'Leary explained that Ryanair opened three new bases and 80 new routes during the period. In addition, it took 
delivery of 35 new Boeing B737 aircraft.
September and October also saw a number of its peers collapse into bankruptcy. Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia - 
carrying a combined 58 million passengers - all suffered this fate. Ryanair argued that there were "other financially 
troubled EU airlines who will, we believe, follow them."
Ryanair said it is responding to the consolidation of the EU market as a result of this. It said it would add more 
aircraft to its UK passenger bases to "take up any slack" created by Monarch's collapse. 
It added that it was "poised" to be the main beneficiary of the "inevitable contraction" of Alitalia's short haul business 
and that it was continuing to grow strongly in Italy.
Ryanair also stated that Lufthansa's acquisition of Air Berlin offers Lufthansa an "anti-competitive" 95% market 
share in the "large" domestic German market.
O'Leary emphasised that Ryanair's own balance sheet "remained strong" with operations generating EUR935 
million in net cash. As a result of capital expenditure of EUR675 million, buybacks of EUR639 million and debt 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Ups Profit And Eyes Opportunities As Peers Collapse
repayments of EUR200 million, however, O'Leary did point out that net debt rose to EUR600 million at the end of 
the first half from EUR244 million on March 31.
The company said it expects to see second half traffic growth slow to 4% from the 11% seen in the first half of the 
year. This is as a consequence of the grounding of 25 aircraft. It therefore expects full year air traffic to slow to 129 
million passengers from 131 million the year before.
Ryanair did believe that fares would fall by between 4% and 6%, slightly better than the previous 5% to 7% fall 
forecast.
All told, Ryanair said it saw "no reason" to alter its full year post-tax profit forecast of between EUR1.40 billion and 
EUR1.45 billion. In 2016, pretax profit amounted to EUR1.40 billion. 
"This guidance, as always, remains heavily dependent on close-in second half bookings, the absence of any further 
security events, air traffic control strikes or negative Brexit developments", O'Leary said.
Shares in Ryanair were 4.6% higher in early trading at EUR16.54 on Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are called to open lower on Tuesday as the pound maintained 
gains overnight from Monday's rebound, ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy decision on Thursday.
In early UK company news, London-listed budget carrier Ryanair said pretax profit and operating revenue for the six 
months to September 30 both rose year-on-year.
Pretax profit was up 10% to EUR1.45 billion from EUR1.31 billion a year earlier, on a total operating revenue which 
increase 7% to EUR4.23 billion against EUR4.12 billion a year before.
The Irish airline maintained its full-year profit after tax guidance, within a range of EUR1.40 billion to EUR1.45 
billion.
Ryanair highlighted concerns surrounding Brexit, saying it remains "concerned" at the "continuing uncertainty" 
surrounding the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in March 2019. 
"There remains a worrying risk of a serious disruption to UK-EU flights in April 2019 unless a timely UK-EU bilateral 
is agreed in advance of September 2018," Ryanair said.
Ryanair additionally said it stands to be the main beneficiary of the "inevitable contraction" in Alitalia's short-haul 
services, and reiterated its negative stance towards Lufthansa's purchase of some of insolvent airline Air Berlin's 
assets, some of which also were bought by UK rival easyJet.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 7.91 points lower at 7,479.90 on Tuesday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2%, or 17.22 points, at 7,487.81 on Monday.
"The pound had a decent day yesterday after the sharp falls seen at the end of last week, over doubts that the 
monetary policy might bottle this week's rate decision," says CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Lower Call; Ryanair First Half Profit Rises
The BoE will announce its latest monetary policy decision, alongside the release of the Monetary Policy Committee 
meeting minutes and Inflation Report, on Thursday at midday.
"Markets still assign an 86% probability that the bank will raise rates for the first time in ten years this Thursday, 
which means the consequences of not doing so are likely to be brutal on the pound," Hewson notes.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3218 early Tuesday, firm against USD1.3198 at the London equities close 
Monday.
Meanwhile, survey data from GfK early Tuesday showed UK consumer confidence weakened in October on 
concerns about wider economic prospects, but willingness to buy improved for the third straight month.
The consumer sentiment index fell by one point to minus 10 in October.
The index measuring changes in personal finances during the last 12 months increased one point to zero. The 
forecast for personal finances over the next 12 months stayed at positive 4. The major purchase index gained two 
points to positive 3 in October. At the same time, the savings index held steady at positive 3.
"The latest Gfk consumer confidence did show a slight fall in October to minus 10 as consumers slowed their 
spending ahead of the Christmas period, though business confidence does appear to be holding steady for the time 
being," comments Hewson.
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending down 0.4%, the S&P 
500 down 0.3% and Nasdaq Composite closing slightly lower.
The US Federal Reserve commences its two-day meeting later today, announcing its monetary policy decision on 
Wednesday.
Overshadowing this meeting is the prospect of who will be at the helm of the US central bank next year. Current 
Chair Janet Yellen's term expires in February, 2018.
US President Donald Trump plans to announce his nominee as the next Federal Reserve Chair on Thursday, White 
House officials told the media on Monday.
Many media outlets have reported that Trump intends to nominate Fed Governor Jerome Powell to replace current 
Yellen. The nomination of Powell would purportedly provide continuity at the Fed, as he has previously supported 
Yellen's general direction in setting monetary policy.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed flat early Tuesday. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.1%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.2%.
The Bank of Japan kept its monetary stimulus unchanged as widely expected early Tuesday.
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his board members decided by an 8-1 majority vote to hold its target of raising the 
amount of outstanding JGB holdings at an annual pace of JPY80 trillion.
The bank will purchase government bonds so that the yield of 10-year JGBs will remain flat. The board also decided 
to maintain the minus 0.1% interest rate on current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the bank.
In China, data early Tuesday showed manufacturing sector growth softened more than expected in October largely 
due to weak new orders.
The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-expected to 51.6 in October from 52.4 in 
September, data published by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed.
This was the weakest reading in three months, having been expected to come in at 52.0. Nonetheless, a score 
above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Lower Call; Ryanair First Half Profit Rises
The non-manufacturing PMI dropped to 54.3 from 55.4 a month ago, which was the strongest since May 2014. A 
sub-index for the construction sector slid 2.6 points to 58.5 in October.
Yet to come in Tuesday's economic calendar, French third quarter GDP is at 0745 GMT, while eurozone GDP is at 
1000 GMT. In the US in the afternoon, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index is at 1300 GMT, and the Chicago 
PMI reading at 1530 GMT. The API weekly crude oil stock is at 2030 GMT.
Markets in Germany are closed on Tuesday for Reformation Day bank holiday.
Highlighting the UP corporate calendar on Tuesday are third-quarter results from oil major BP, a trading update 
from advertising giant WPP, and third-quarter results from engineer Weir Group and from online takeaway platform 
Just Eat.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget carrier Ryanair said pretax profit and operating revenue for the six months to 
September 30 both rose year-on-year.
Pretax profit was up 10% to EUR1.45 billion from EUR1.31 billion a year earlier, on a total operating revenue which 
increase 7% to EUR4.23 billion against EUR4.12 billion a year before.
The Irish airline maintained its full-year profit after tax guidance, within a range of EUR1.40 billion to EUR1.45 
billion.
Ryanair highlighted concerns surrounding Brexit, saying it remains "concerned" at the "continuing uncertainty" 
surrounding the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in March 2019.
"There remains a worrying risk of a serious disruption to UK-EU flights in April 2019 unless a timely UK-EU bilateral 
is agreed in advance of September 2018," Ryanair said.
On Monday, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, 
said Brexit is unlikely to ground flights between the UK and EU. Walsh said that such a move would bring the entire 
continent to a standstill, the Press Association reported. 
Walsh told the UK Commons Transport Committee: "The prospect of there being no flying between the UK and and 
Europe, I don't agree with at all. I think this would bring the whole of Europe to a standstill." 
The comments came after Chancellor Philip Hammond had said it is "theoretically conceivable" that all flights 
between the EU and the UK could be suspended on the day Britain leaves the EU.
LONDON BRIEFING: IAG Relaxed About Brexit Uncertainty; Less So Ryanair
Walsh said clarity on how the post-Brexit situation would impact on airlines would be helpful, but IAG could deal 
with uncertainty. He told MPs: "It would be nice to have certainty as soon as possible. I don't believe it's essential to 
have that by summer of next year. I think it becomes more relevant if it's by the end of October.
"To be honest with you, I'm happy to operate in an area of uncertainty right up until the last minute."
Meanwhile, Ryanair also said Tuesday it stands to be the main beneficiary of the "inevitable contraction" in Alitalia's 
short-haul services, and reiterated its negative stance towards Lufthansa's purchase of some of insolvent airline Air 
Berlin's assets, some of which also were bought by UK rival easyJet.
Ryanair shares were up 3.4% early Tuesday, while IAG shares were down 0.3%.

UK consumer confidence weakened in October on concerns about wider economic prospects but willingness to buy 
improved for the third straight month, survey data from GfK showed. The consumer sentiment index fell by one 
point to -10 in October. "As concerns about the wider economic prospects for the UK economy dampen our outlook, 
consumers are showing no real 'get-up-and-go'," Joe Staton, head of Market Dynamics at GfK, said. Both

US President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was charged with conspiracy and money 
laundering related to his lobbying work for a pro-Russian party in Ukraine, while a separate guilty plea revealed 
efforts by a Trump foreign policy aide to reach out to Moscow. A 12-count indictment handed down by a grand jury 
in Washington charges Manafort and his business associate Richard Gates with conspiracy to defraud the US, 
money laundering and violations of lobbying laws. Meanwhile, a former foreign policy adviser for Trump's 
presidential campaign has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, according to documents 
unsealed Monday. While working for the campaign, George Papadopoulos met with a professor with ties to the 
Russian government about "dirt" and "thousands of emails" that were supposedly damaging to Trump's Democratic 
rival Hillary Clinton, according to legal documents. He has admitted to lying to the FBI about the timing of his 
meetings with the Russians.

Powell, Yellen and Stanford University economist John Taylor were said to be among the leading candidates to be

China's manufacturing sector growth softened more than expected in October largely due to weak new orders, 
official survey data showed. The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-expected to 51.6 in 
October from 52.4 in September, data published by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed. This was the 
weakest reading in three months. The expected score was 52.0. Nonetheless, a score above 50 indicates 
expansion in the sector. The non-manufacturing PMI dropped to 54.3 from 55.4 a month ago, which was the 
strongest since May 2014. A sub-index for the construction sector slid 2.6 points to 58.5 in October.
----------
The Bank of Japan downgraded its inflation forecast for the current financial year, while maintaining its ultra-easing 
monetary policy to stimulate the world's third-largest economy. The central bank expects Japan's consumer price 
index to climb 0.8% this year, down from the 1.1% rise predicted three months ago, it said in a statement released 
after a two-day monetary policy meeting. The bank launched an aggressive monetary easing campaign in April 
2013 in order to achieve 2% inflation within two years, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed to lift the country out of 
a deflationary spiral. The bank, however, decided in July to once again postpone the timing for reaching the inflation 
target. It now expects to achieve the goal around fiscal year 2019 though it predicted that it would do so around 
fiscal year 2018.
----------
Japan's industrial production declined at a slower-than-expected pace in September, preliminary figures from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. Industrial production dropped a seasonally adjusted 1.1% month-
over-month in September, reversing a 2.0% rise in August. That was below the 1.6% decrease expected by 
economists.

South Korea and China have agreed to bring relations "back onto a normal track as soon as possible", the Foreign 
Ministry in Seoul announced Tuesday, after relations between the nations deteriorated over the deployment of a 
controversial US missile defence system. Both sides agreed to talks and South Korean President Moon Jae In will 
meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of next month's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in 
Vietnam.
----------
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis said Monday that US 
President Donald Trump could only use force against North Korea in the event of an imminent or actual attack on 
the US. Trump would otherwise need congressional approval, Mattis said, as the two men testified before the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on potential revisions to a 16-year-old law on authorizing the use of military 
force. "In this case of North Korea, it would be a direct imminent or actual attack on the US," Mattis said when 
asked about Trump's powers regarding authorization for military action in North Korea.

BP said its performance in the third quarter of 2017 was well ahead of the previous year, allowing it to turn to profit

quarterly dividend flat at 10 cents per share for the three months to the end of September, but said it plans to offer a

BHP Billiton and partner Vale have been given a time extension to strike a preliminary agreement with federal 
prosecutors in Brazil over the Samarco dam failure, the London-listed mining group said. Samarco's dam failure in 
2015 flooded a neighbouring village, contaminated a local river in the Minas Gerais state, and caused multiple 
deaths. In January of this year, the 50:50 partners in the project entered into a preliminary agreement with the 
Federal Prosecutors' Office in Brazil, outlining the timeline for negotiations over public civil claims, one worth 
BRL155 billion, about GBP35.7 billion, and the other BRL20 billion, about GBP4.6 billion. The extension runs until 
November 16, with all suspensions of legal proceedings and injunctions remaining in place in the interim. BHP and 
Vale had originally hoped to have a finalised deal in place by the middle of 2017.

Advertising and marketing blue-chip WPP warned like-for-like revenue and net sales growth over the full year are 
both expected to be broadly flat, as it reported third quarter revenue only rose due to weaker sterling and a boost

from the previous year's GBP10.15 billion. However, at constant currency revenue fell 0.4% and like-for-like 
revenue declined by 2.0%, with acquisitions providing 1.6% growth. Third quarter net sales rose 2.4% to GBP3.19 
billion, rising 0.9% at constant currency but falling 1.1% on a like-for-like basis, with acquisitions providing a 2.0% 
boost.

Chad is on a collision course with top creditor Glencore as it wants to divert oil from the Swiss trading house to US

The UK government is to take a "surprising" course of action in its triannual review of the gambling industry by 
failing to take decisive action over the size of stakes on betting terminals, the Daily Telegraph reported. The review, 
the newspaper said, is likely to offer a consultation period on how much gamblers can bet in one go on fixed-odds 
machines when it is released on Tuesday rather than take a firm stance on what the limit should be. The Telegraph 
said the industry expects three options in terms of maximum stakes, with many expecting a choice of either 
GBP2.00, GBP20.00, or GBP50.00. The current limit is GBP100.00.

Samsung Electronics reported third-quarter operating profit that more than doubled from last year. The South 
Korean company also said it will increase annual dividends in 2017 by 20%, which will be followed by a 100% rise 
in dividends in 2018. The 2019 and 2020 dividends will be kept at the same level with 2018. The company said 
strong demand for high-performance memory chipsets for servers and flagship mobile devices was a contributing 
factor to the company's overall robust performance in the third quarter. Operating profit for the third-quarter was

Japanese consumer electronics maker Sony Corp reported its second-quarter net income attributable to 
stockholders multiplied to JPY130.9 billion, or USD1.16 billion, from last year's JPY4.8 billion. Operating income 
was JPY204.2 billion, or USD1.81 billion, significantly higher than JPY45.7 billion a year ago. The big rise was 
mainly due to the improvements of operating results in the Semiconductors and G&NS segments. Sales and

operating revenue climbed 22% to JPY2.06 trillion, or USD18.25 billion, from the prior year's JPY1.69 trillion. 
Looking ahead, for fiscal 2018, Sony lifted its forecast.
----------
French bank BNP Paribas reported its third-quarter net income to equity holders were up 8.3% to EUR2.04 billion 
from EUR1.89 billion in the previous year. Excluding one-off items, net income was EUR2.05 billion, down 6.7% 
from the prior year. Third-quarter revenue was EUR10.39 billion, down 1.9% compared to EUR10.59 billion a year 
ago, due to an unfavourable foreign exchange effect. They were down 0.1% at constant scope and exchange rates.
----------
Aerospace and defence firm Airbus Group reported its third-quarter net income attributable to equity owners of the 
parent surged to EUR348 million from EUR50 million last year. Earnings before interest and tax or EBIT was 
EUR521 million, up 3% from EUR505 million a year ago. Adjusted EBIT dropped 4% to EUR697 million from 
EUR729 million a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter increased 2% to EUR14.24 billion from EUR13.95 billion in 
the prior year. Revenue growth was mainly driven by Commercial Aircraft, offset by lower revenue from fewer 
deliveries and services at Helicopters. Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said: "The strong backlog and a 
healthy market environment continue to support our commercial aircraft production ramp-up plans. We confirm our 
outlook even though this year's delivery schedule is extremely back-loaded, largely due to the well-known engine 
problems plaguing our A320neo Family."

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The majority of the European markets are set to end Tuesday's 
session with modest gains. Trading activity was on the light side, due to a public holiday in Germany.
Investors also remain in a cautious mood ahead of tomorrow's policy decision by the Federal Reserve and 
Thursday's announcement from the Bank of England.
In addition to the central bank announcements, traders are also looking forward to a number of important corporate 
earnings report and economic reports, including the US jobs report for October on Friday.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced about 0.40%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks increased around 0.40%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, 
added about 0.50%.
The DAX of Germany was closed for a holiday, but the CAC 40 of France rose about 0.25%. The FTSE 100 of the 
UK gained around 0.10% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by about 0.80%.
In Paris, Airbus rallied nearly 4% after reaffirming its 2017 guidance. BNP Paribas tumbled nearly 3% after the 
lender posted lower trading revenues in the third quarter.
In London, BP jumped nearly 2%. The oil giant reported a 9.2% increase in third-quarter earnings and announced it 
would launch a share buyback.
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings climbed almost 7%. The company maintained its full-year profit guidance after 
reporting an 11% increase in first-half profit.
Specialty chemicals firm Croda gained over 4% after a good performance across all three businesses in the third 
quarter.
European Markets Finished Mostly Higher In Cautious Trade
Packaging company DS Smith advanced about 1% after it delivered first-half trading results in line with 
expectations.
WPP rose nearly 3% despite the advertising giant lowering its full-year earnings forecasts, saying firms are 
reducing advertising spend.
Pumps specialist Weir Group dropped nearly 7% after a profit warning.
The euro area economy expanded at a faster than expected pace in the third quarter and the unemployment rate 
fell to a more than eight-year low, while inflation slowed unexpectedly, official data revealed Tuesday.
Gross domestic product climbed 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, but the rate was slightly slower than the revised 0.7% 
expansion seen in the second quarter, preliminary flash estimate published by Eurostat showed.
Economists had forecast the sequential growth rate to ease to 0.5% from the second quarter's initial estimate of 
0.6%.
Eurozone inflation eased unexpectedly in October, though marginally, flash data from Eurostat showed Tuesday. 
Inflation slowed to 1.4% in October from 1.5% in September. Economists had expected the inflation to remain 
stable at 1.5%.
The euro area unemployment rate reached its lowest level since January 2009, data from Eurostat showed 
Tuesday. The jobless rate fell to 8.9% in September from 9% in August. This was the lowest since January 2009. 
The rate was forecast to remain at 9%.
France's economy expanded as expected in the third quarter, first estimate from the statistical office Insee revealed 
Tuesday. Gross domestic product grew 0.5% sequentially, in line with expectations, but slightly slower than the 
revised 0.6% expansion posted in the second quarter.
France's inflation increased in October on higher food prices, provisional estimate from the statistical office Insee 
showed Tuesday. Consumer price inflation rose to 1.1% in October from 1% in September. Inflation was forecast to 
remain unchanged at 1%. Final data is due on November 15.
France's consumer spending increased in September after falling in the previous month, figures from the statistical 
office INSEE showed Tuesday. Consumer spending rose 0.9% month-over-month in September, reversing a 0.2% 
drop in August.
UK consumer confidence weakened in October on concerns about wider economic prospects but willingness to buy 
improved for the third straight month, survey data from GfK showed Tuesday. The consumer sentiment index fell by 
one point to -10 in October.
China's manufacturing sector growth softened more than expected in October largely due to weak new orders, 
official survey data showed Tuesday.
The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-expected to 51.6 in October from 52.4 in 
September, data published by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed. This was the weakest reading in three 
months. The expected score was 52.0.
Growth in Chicago-area business activity unexpectedly accelerated in the month of October, according to a report 
released by MNI Indicators on Tuesday.
MNI Indicators said its Chicago business barometer rose to 66.2 in October from 65.2 in September, with a reading 
above 50 indicating growth. The increase surprised economists, who had expected the barometer to drop to 61.0.
Consumer confidence in the US saw a significant improvement in the month of October, the Conference Board 
revealed in a report released on Tuesday.
European Markets Finished Mostly Higher In Cautious Trade
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped to 125.9 in October from an upwardly revised 
120.6 in September. Economists had expected the index to inch up to 121.0 from the 119.8 originally reported for

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks started trading in positive territory on Friday, with Royal Bank of Scotland Group 
surging to the top of London's blue-chip index after the bank, majority-owned by the UK government, turned to profit 
in the first nine months of the year. 
RBS turned to a pretax profit of GBP2.82 billion in the first nine months of the year from the GBP19 million loss a 
year earlier, as net interest income rose to GBP6.77 billion from GBP6.50 billion, and total revenue rose to 
GBP10.07 billion from GBP9.37 billion. 
The improvement was driven by a positive third quarter, when profit more than trebled.
RBS said that it expects to deliver its annual goals in 2017, and remain profitable in 2018. 
RBS was up 2.4% in early trade Friday. Barclays, having disappointed the market on Thursday despite reporting a 
huge jump in quarterly profit, was rebounding on Friday morning in sympathy, up 0.7%, while Lloyds Banking Group 
was up 0.6%, having been the first to release results earlier in the week. 
The last of the big four UK-listed banks, HSBC Holdings, is due to report its results early next Monday. 
The FTSE 100 index was up 0.2% early Friday, or 16.4 points higher at 7,503.72. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index 
was down 0.1%, or 20.05 points at 20,142.87, and the AIM All-Share index was up 0.2%, or 1.95 points at 1,028.65.
The BATS UK 100 index was up 0.3% at 12,755.17. The BATS 250 was down 0.1% at 18,375.00, while the BATS 
Small Companies was trading slightly higher at 12,490.28.
Compass Group was gaining ground, up 1.4%, after RBC Capital raised the services firm to Outperform while 
bumping up its price target. 
At the bottom of the blue chip index was International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 3.4%, despite forecasting 
an 18% jump in annual adjusted operating profit in 2017 to EUR3.00 billion from EUR2.54 billion in 2016. 
LONDON MARKET OPEN: RBS Rises On Return To Profit, IAG Sinks Airlines
Although its financial performance is on track, the British Airways, Vueling, Iberia and Aer Lingus owner also said 
passenger revenue per available seat kilometres fell 1.4%, countered by a 1.9% drop in non-fuel costs per seat. 
IAG's peers were being dragged down as well, with easyJet down 2.1%, while midcap Wizz Air Holdings was down 
1.5%. Ryanair Holdings was faring better, down just 0.4%.
Miners were the other major drag on the FTSE 100, with Anglo American down 2.4%, Antofagasta down 2.4%, Rio 
Tinto down 2.0%, BHP down 1.9% and Glencore trading 1.8% lower. 
In the FTSE 250, Elementis sat atop the index, up 3.7%, after it said trends seen in the first half continued into the 
third quarter, leaving it on course to grow operating profit across all three segments in 2017, despite experiencing 
some raw material cost inflation. 
Meanwhile, Tullow Oil sank to the bottom of the midcap index, down 4.0%, after its Araku-1 exploration well 
offshore Suriname came up dry as it failed to make a commercial discovery. However, some gas condensate was 
found in the well. 
Pharma giant Shire is still to release third-quarter results later on Friday, at around midday. 
In European equities, the CAC 40 index in Paris was up 0.5% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.7% early 
Friday. 
Europe remained centre stage early Friday following the European Central Bank's announcement on Thursday, 
when President Mario Draghi said the bank will drag out its  tapering of asset purchases, kicking expectations of 
any interest rate hike well into the future, possibly even beyond Draghi's scheduled departure at the end of October 
2019.
Early Friday, data from Destatis showed Germany's import price inflation rose to a four-month high in September, 
climbing 3% year-on-year and beating expectations for a 2.6% rise. This was faster than the 2.1% increase in 
August and represented the fastest pace of growth since May, when prices edged 4.1% higher. 
French consumer confidence weakened unexpectedly in October, survey data from the statistical office Insee 
showed. The consumer sentiment index fell to 100 in October from 101 in September.
This was the fourth consecutive decline and a similar lower score was last posted in April. The score was forecast 
to remain unchanged at 100 in October.
The euro was quoted at USD1.1624 early Friday, soft from USD1.1697 at the European equities close on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, the pound was at USD1.3098 in early trade, down sharply from USD1.3174  at the close on Thursday. 
The remaining economic news on Friday is US-focused, with GDP at 1330 BST, the Michigan consumer sentiment 
index at 1500 BST, and the Baker Hughes US oil rig count at 1800 BST. 
"We forecast that third quarter real GDP advanced at a robust 2.3% quarter-on-quarter annualized rate compared 
to the prior expectation of 1.5% quarter-on-quarter, as the net hurricane impact has turned out to be more muted 
than expected, with some affected sectors already rebounding in September," said Berenberg economist Mickey 
Levy. 
"Given the early rebound in September, fourth quarter GDP will show a smaller bounce back than previously 
expected. We now expect fourth quarter real GDP to increase by 2.8%, compared to 3.4% before. Second half 
2017 GDP is estimated to advance by 2.6%, and full-year real GDP is expected to increase by 2.2%," he added.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.3%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is still trading, currently up 0.6%.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: RBS Rises On Return To Profit, IAG Sinks Airlines
China's industrial profit growth accelerated further in September, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics 
showed. Industrial profits surged 28% year-over-year in September, faster than the 24% spike in August. Moreover, 
the latest rate of growth was the quickest since 2011.
Overall consumer prices in Japan climbed 0.7% on year in September, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
Communications said. That was in line with expectations and unchanged from the August reading. Core inflation 
also advanced an annual 0.7% - again matching forecasts and steady from the previous month.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The British Airline Pilots' Association, or Balpa, is consulting with Ryanair Holdings 
PLC’s UK-based pilots, many of whom are contractors, to see if there is support for a group legal action to establish 
employee or worker rights from either the employment agencies or Ryanair directly, the Financial Times reported 
Thursday.
"In response to calls from our pilots, we are currently looking at Ryanair’s contractor employment model and 
whether there’s anything that can be done about it. We are looking at whether it can be challenged in a similar way 
that Uber drivers challenged their status?," Balpa General Secretary Brian Strutton told the newspaper. 
"Many pilots who fly for Ryanair are not in fact employed by them but are agency workers, supplied through several 
different third, or even fourth-party companies," Strutton added.
As part of the consultation, which ends on November 6, Balpa is also asking whether pilots are prepared to support 
industrial action, the Financial Times reported.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday that the current Chief Executive of Malaysia 
Airlines Berhad, Peter Bellew, will re-join the company as chief operations officer, effective December 1. 
Bellew will take over responsibility for all Ryanair's flight operations, ground operations and engineering and will be 
specifically be responsible for pilot production, training and career development.  He previously was Ryanair's flight 
operations director until 2014.
The Irish low-cost airline earlier in September said that it will cancel up to 50 flights a day until end of October due 
to a pilot rostering error.
"Peter will lead a significant transformation in the way we reward and interact with our pilots, improve their working 
environment and career development over the coming years as we grow the fleet to some 600 aircraft and expand 
our traffic, at lower fares, to 200 million customers per annum," said Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.1% at EUR16.58 Tuesday.

Remnants Of Hurricane Ophelia Set To Batter UK And Ireland

LONDON (Alliance News) - Storm Ophelia is to batter the UK and Ireland with gusts of up to 80mph, with the Met 
Office warning of potential "danger to life".
Fears about the impact of strong winds have seen troops placed on standby and many public services in Ireland 
closed with schools, government buildings and courts among the services affected.
Remnants of Ophelia - which was previously classified as a hurricane as it made its way across the Atlantic - will 
reach home shores on Monday, resulting in "exceptional" weather - exactly 30 years after the Great Storm of 1987 
killed 18 people.
Schools and colleges will also be closed in Northern Ireland, which is covered with an amber weather warning - 
meaning there is a "potential risk to life and property", issued when forecasters believe people need to be prepared 
to change their plans and protect themselves from the impacts of severe weather.
Forecasters are warning of flying debris, such as tiles blown from roofs, as well as large waves around coastal 
districts with beach material being thrown on to coastal roads, sea fronts and properties.
"This leads to the potential for injuries and danger to life," the Met Office said.
Very windy weather is expected across the entire region, while a yellow warning is in place for much of Wales, 
Scotland, north east England, north west England, south west England and the West Midlands.
In Ireland, Met Eireann has issued a "status red" weather alert for Galway, Mayo, Clare, Cork and Kerry, warning of 
severe winds and stormy conditions.
Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said that while storms with these wind speeds tend to happen at this time of year, 
the one on its way is "quite a substantial system", adding that he would describe it as "pretty exceptional".
Remnants Of Hurricane Ophelia Set To Batter UK And Ireland
Mr Miall said Ophelia will have gone through a transition on its way across the Atlantic but will still bring "hurricane-
force" winds.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar tweeted: "Defence forces being deployed in Red weather alert areas and on standby for 
further action (on Monday).
"Please check in with older neighbours and those who need medical care."
Meanwhile, airports are advising passengers in Ireland to check the latest information, with a n umber of Aer Lingus 
flights cancelled due to severe weather and the prospect of further cancellations with other carriers.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC resisted moves by pilots to unionise on Thursday, after one 
demanded the Irish airline adopts a new approach to industrial relations, Reuters reported.
The European Cockpit Association, which represents pilot unions, said the demand by Imelda Comer represented 
the view of pilots in the majority of Ryanair's 86 bases, who are in the process of setting up a pan-European 
representative body.
After the airline said it would not respond to anonymous letters, Comer became the first Ryanair captain to speak 
publicly in a letter to Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, Reuters said. 
Ryanair, which does not recognise trade unions, dismissed Comer's letter as "disingenuous" and said it would not 
correspond with any newly formed pilot group. It said Comer had already resigned and was due to leave Ryanair on 
October 31, Reuters reported.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers has sparked outrage by cancelling thousands of flights after it did 
not have enough standby pilots to operate its schedule.
O'Leary responded by promising significant improvements for pilots, saying it would exceed rates paid by rivals and 
improve job security.
But the offer has received a cool response from some pilots who have been organising on social media in recent 
weeks to use the pilot shortage to press for better conditions, Reuters said.
Ryanair will only bargain with Employee Representative Councils, Reuters said. However, some pilots have 
complained that the ERCs do not provide them with the means to negotiate in any meaningful way and allow 
management to play different bases off against each other. 
They have demanded a new independent and pan-European representative body, pilots and unions have said, 
according to Reuters.

LONDON (Alliance News) - FTSE 100-listed budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is set to challenge a Deutsche 
Lufthansa AG deal to acquire parts of its failed German peer Air Berlin PLC, after calling it a "stitch-up", reported 
BBC News on Friday.
Lufthansa, the largest airline in Germany, signed a EUR210.0 million deal to buy assets from the insolvent Air Berlin 
on Thursday in order to quickly expands its own budget business, Eurowings. 
The deal would see Lufthansa pick up Austrian leisure travel airline Niki, LG Walter regional airline, and 20 further 
aircraft from Air Berlin which filed for bankruptcy in August after its largest shareholders, Etihad, refused to offer 
additional financial support.
Air Berlin flights have continued courtesy of a EUR150.0 million loan from the German government. 
Lufthansa Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said he expected to receive approval for the deal from the 
European Union by the end of 2017.
Ryanair had previously described the deal as a "stitch-up" in order to strengthen Lufthansa. A spokesman for the 
company said it would "be referring the matter to the EU competition authority in due course."
BBC News said that German Head of Cartel Office Andreas Mundt had stated that the European Commission 
would take a close look at the Lufthansa deal and that German authorities would be following the process closely.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC is looking into buying up the London 
Gatwick slots of recently-collapsed airline Monarch, IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh told Reuters on Friday, while 
also expressing concerns over Deutsche Lufthansa AG's Air Berlin PLC deal.
At the CAPA centre for aviation global summit, the IAG boss told Reuters: "With Monarch, I think everybody's 
interested in slots at Gatwick, and that would be principally our interest as well [...] If we can get more slots at 
Gatwick, we'll certainly be looking for more."
Luton-based Monarch entered into administration at 0400 BST on October 2, the biggest UK airline ever to cease 
trading.
In a separate Reuters article, the outlet reported Walsh expressed competition concerns following Lufthansa's 
purchase of multiple assets from Air Berlin. 
Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy on August 15 after its main shareholder, Etihad, said it would not give further financial 
support. The company continued its operations through a government loan.
Lufthansa agreed on Thursday to pay EUR210 million for 81 of Air Berlin's total of 140 aircraft and to hire 3,000 of 
its more than 8,000 employees. Air Berlin last year ran up a loss of about EUR782 million and has debts totalling 
nearly EUR1.2 billion.
"We did make a bid for Air Berlin, but our view was that Lufthansa was always going to get it," Walsh told Reuters at 
the CAPA summit in London.
"We will watch carefully because we think there are significant competition issues," he added.
BBC News on earlier on Friday reported budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is also set to challenge Lufthansa's 
Air Berlin deal.

The Irish low-cost airline had previously said Air Berlin's insolvency had been "set up" to allow Lufthansa to take 
over a "debt-free" Air Berlin, which would be in breach of German and EU competition rules.
Ryanair in August urged regulators to block the "stitch-up between the German government, Lufthansa and Air 
Berlin", which it defined as an "anti-consumer takeover".
Shares in IAG were down 0.5% at 623.50 pence on Friday, while Ryanair was down 0.4% at EUR16.84.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Wednesday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
easyJet, up 3.0%, International Consolidated Airlines Group, up 1.5%. Shares in the airline operators were higher 
following the conclusion of the latest French air traffic control strikes on Wednesday morning. The strikes, which 
started Monday, saw the cancellations of hundreds of flights and affected flights passing through French airspace. 
The disruptions also had knock-on delays to other flights as well as those coming to and from French airports. 
"Despite the disruption caused by yesterday's French air traffic control strike, the likes of easyJet and IAG remain 
amongst the market leaders this morning, with investors hoping there will be upside for such firms in the wake of 
the Ryanair cancellations and Monarch collapse," said IG Group analyst Josh Mahony. 
Paddy Power Betfair, up 1.0%. Macquarie started coverage on the bookmaker with an Outperform rating. 
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
Mondi, down 8.2%. The Anglo-South African paper and packaging company warned its underlying performance for 
the full financial year will be "modestly below" market expectations due to continuing cost pressures and negative 
currency movements. Mondi reported 8% rise in adjusted operating profit for the third quarter ended September 30 
to EUR245.0 million on the back of increased average selling prices and higher sales volumes. The quarterly 
results were dented by increased costs and negative currency movements. The company also recorded a charge of 
EUR30.0 million in the quarter relating to planned mill maintenance shut downs. Blue-chip peer Smurfit Kappa was 
down 2.6%, and midcap peer DS Smith was down 3.3%.

Next, down 1.0%. Morgan Stanley downgraded the clothing and homewares retailer to Underweight from Equal 
Weight. 
----------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
Dunelm Group, up 4.0%. The homewares retailer said it maintained the "good momentum" from the final quarter of 
its last financial year, with revenue in the first quarter rising by 25%. Dunelm said its revenue increased in the 13 
weeks ended September 30 to GBP247.9 million from GBP198.7 million in same period last year. The retailer said 
that its like-for-like revenue also grew by 9.3% to GBP214.3 million. Chairman Andy Harrison said "like-for-like 
sales were boosted by favourable weather comparatives" and Dunelm continues "to outperform the homewares 
market, with strong growth across the business, especially online". During the period Dunelm said it opened five 
new stores, increasing its portfolio to 165 stores, and is "legally committed" to a further five new stores, one of 
which is a relocation. "The retailer stated it continues to 'outperform' in the homewares market, which is impressive 
as companies like DFS have been finding trading tough. Dunelm's stock has hit a nine month high, and if the bullish 
sentiment continues it could target 816 pence – its 2017 high," said CMC Markets analyst David Madden. 
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
PageGroup, down 5.5%. The recruiter saw third quarter profit rise, though performance in its UK operations, which 
is its largest market, lagged behind the rest of the world. Total gross profit for the quarter, which ended September 
30, rose to GBP177.3 million from the comparative period's GBP158.6 million, a rise of 8.8% at constant currency 
and 12% at reported rates. However, UK gross profit fell by 7.6% at both rates to GBP34.9 million from GBP37.8 
million, with the company blaming the UK's withdrawal from the EU and general political uncertainty. PageGroup 
said its outlook for full-year operating profit remains in line with current consensus expectations.
Provident Financial, down 4.6%. Barclays downgraded the subprime lender to Underweight from Equal Weight. 
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Gulfsands Petroleum, up 9.6%. The oil and gas company announced a "significant" reset of its Putumayo-14 
licence in Colombia. Gulfsands said it received confirmation from Colombia's Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos 
that the licence will be reset to Phase 0, giving the company time to complete the consultation process with local 
indigenous communities. Once Phase 0 is complete it will re-enter the full three-year Phase 1 exploration period, 
meaning the licence will run until at least mid-2021. Gulfsands said the reset relieves any immediate time 
constraints for the company and any prospective partners. Managing Director John Bell said: "This is very 
significant news for Gulfsands' operations in Colombia. The approval of Phase 0 enables Gulfsands to continue in 
full compliance with the licence and to plan its strategy for Putumayo-14 without immediate time constraints. " 
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
Character Group, down 21%. The toys and games developer warned it expects performance for its full year ending 
in August 2018 will be significantly below current market estimates with "several" factors affecting the company. 
Though domestic sales in the UK are holding up at levels comparable to last year, international sales have been 
affected by one of the world's largest toy retailers filing for bankruptcy in the US and Canada, which has had a 
knock-on effect on every market in which it trades, Character said. Further, the company said international 
customers have taking a "very" conservative approach to purchases. The downgrade in expectations comes less 
than a month after the toy maker fired its Finance Director Mark Dowding after the board lost confidence in his 
ability to fulfil the role.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday promised its pilots significant improvements in pay 
and conditions, stating it would exceed rates paid by rivals and improve job security, according to a letter to pilots 
seen by Reuters.
The Irish airline, the largest in Europe by passenger numbers, has in recent weeks announced the cancellation of 
thousands of flights, saying it did not have enough standby pilots to ensure the smooth operation of its schedule.
Ryanair will deliver "significant improvements to your rosters, your pay, your basing, your contracts and your career 
progression over the next 12 months," Chief Executive Michael O‘Leary said in the letter addressed to all Ryanair 
pilots.
The letter said Ryanair would exceed the pay and job security offered by rivals like Jet2 and Norwegian Air Shuttle 
and that it would negotiate on any differences in conditions between Ryanair's Irish contracts and those offered by 
local laws at European bases.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Despite posting a "record" summer and narrowing its full-year profit guidance to the top 
end of its previously forecast range, easyJet sank to the bottom of the FTSE 100 Friday, with analysts highlighting 
the cost pressures and tough market the airline continues to face.
easyJet was the worst large-cap performer on Friday, down 2.8% at 1,247.60 pence.
The budget carrier on Friday said that it continued to drive passenger and load factor growth in the three months 
ended September 30, with "record" passenger numbers of 24.1 million and a load factor of 95.6%.
As a result of the positive summer, easyJet said it expects headline pretax profit to be between GBP405 million to 
GBP410 million, towards the upper end of its full-year guidance.
In July, easyJet said it expected headline pretax profit for the full year to be between GBP380 million and GBP420 
million, up 3.5% to 14% from its original target to deliver annual profit of GBP367 million. 
In the 2016 financial year, pretax profit amounted to GBP495 million, having sank 28% from the year before.
Liberum noted that this narrowing of its profit guidance for 2017 is only marginally above consensus figures of 
around GBP400 million, and below the broker's own estimate GBP419 million. 
"We believe the market has been pricing in a better outturn," Liberum added.
Liberum highlighted that revenue trends are improving, "but pricing remains under pressure" as revenue per seat 
fell by 3.7% in constant currency during the fourth quarter. 
"easyJet has a strong core business but growth is harder to come by in its capacity-constrained hubs," noted 
Panmure analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue.
IN THE KNOW: Bumpy Ride In Short-Haul Market Continuing For easyJet
Nonetheless, Ryanair's own-goal on flight cancellations and news of Monarch's administration on Monday - the 
latter of which airline sharing a route overlap with easyJet at Gatwick and Luton - should "make for a more benign 
near-term trading environment", said Panmure.
However, Liberum argued that despite these factors, it believes current trading conditions in the European short 
haul market remain tough. 
Even taking recent airline failures into account, such as Monarch's collapse into administration, and the subsequent 
opening up of greater expansion opportunities, "capacity growth seems likely to continue to outstrip undisturbed 
demand growth, implying ongoing downward pressure on pricing", Liberum said.
easyJet's financials remain under pressure, Liberum added. 
The broker said it expects margins to stabilise, with cheaper unit fuel costs from expensive hedges unwinding and 
balancing unit revenue pressure. 
Although easyJet's strategic positioning "remains attractive", Liberum said its capital expenditure programme 
means that free cash flow is to remain negative in the broker's forecasts, with leverage continuing to rise.
Cutting expenditure is unlikely to be an option, Liberum added, given that upgrading to larger aircrafts are an 
"important source of unit cost savings".
easyJet trades on at 13.8 times its 2018 price to earnings ratio, a "modest discount" to London-listed carrier 
Ryanair, "but a rating that does not adequately reflect the group's negative free cash flow and rising leverage", 
Liberum said. 
Liberum retained its Sell recommendation, with an 1,100p price target.
At 14 times its 2018 price to earnings ratio, according to Panmure estimates, the broker said it struggles to justify 
"the valuation premium" to a historic average of 11.5 times the ratio, given the firm's chief executive is "in limbo" 
and the uncertainty over UK flying rights post-Brexit. 
easyJet Chief Executive Carolyn McCall will join fellow FTSE 100-listed firm ITV in January.
Panmure kept its Sell recommendation with a price target of 1,050p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
easyJet said it saw "record" passenger numbers and load factors in the summer of 2017, and now expects full-year 
profit to be at the upper end of its previous guidance. However, the airline warned it expects ongoing pressure on 
yields as capacity in the wider market continues to grow, while foreign exchange will also have a material knock on 
profit for its recently-ended financial year. The budget carrier said that it continued to drive passenger and load 
factor growth in the three months ended September 30, with "record" passenger numbers of 24.1 million, which 
drove a load factor of 95.6%. easyJet said passengers benefited in the summer benefited from low fares across the 
network, particularly on beach markets from the UK. "easyJet has finished the year with continued positive 
momentum delivering both a strong final quarter and a strong second half. Passenger numbers and load factor in 
the final quarter set new records and the second half profit was over GBP100 million higher than summer 2016," 
said Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall.

planned for three days from October 12 and for four days from October 19. Brian Strutton, general secretary of 
British Airline Pilots Association told Sky News: "Our members voted to end this dispute by binding arbitration, 
which Thomas Cook has now agreed to." "I am pleased that we have been able to find a peaceful way of resolving 
the pilots' pay dispute without further disruption to passengers," Strutton added.

Glencore said it has entered into an agreement to buy a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa Proprietary and 
Chevron Botswana Proprietary. Glencore said it will pay USD973 million in cash from its existing resources for a 
75% stake Chevron South Africa and certain related interests, as well as the entire issued share capital of Chevron 
Botswana. Glencore said the agreement covers the interests of Chevron in its manufacturing, retail and industrial 
supply business in South Africa and Botswana. Glencore believes that these provide an attractive downstream 
opportunity for its oil business and the agreement includes the retention of the local management team and 
workforce.

CRH noted US-based cement firm Ash Grove's extension to obtain shareholder approval for a takeover by the 
London-listed building materials group. CRH said in late September it had agreed to buy Ash Grove for USD3.5 
billion, with the transaction expected to close before the end of the year. However, Ash Grove also announced on 
Thursday it received a preliminary competing proposal from a third party to acquire Ash Grove at an indicated 
enterprise value of USD3.7 billion to USD3.8 billion, potentially above CRH's bid.
----------
Ultra Electronics noted Sparton Corp shareholders approved the acquisition deal agreed earlier in the year. In July, 
Ultra said it planned to acquire Sparton for USD234.8 million, funded in part through a share placing. Sparton was a

own shareholders voted 96.8% in favour of the deal in August. The company said that although the transaction 
remains subject to "other customary closing conditions", it is still targeting a completion date by January 1, 2018.

Platinum in the project. Lonmin is currently raising its stake in the joint venture to 100% through various deals that 
were announced in May. It expects the acquisition of Anglo American Platinum and Northam Platinum's interests to 
be completed before the announcing its full-year results in November, it said. Lonmin currently holds a 50% stake in

TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK House Price Growth Accelerates In September
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK house prices increased at a faster pace in September, data from the mortgage lender Halifax and IHS Markit 
showed. House prices increased 4% year-on-year in three months to September, faster than the 2.6% rise seen in 
three months to August. This was the biggest annual growth since February and exceeded the expected rate of 
3.6%. The average house price was GBP225,109, the highest on record. On a monthly basis, growth in house 
prices eased to 0.8% from 1.5% in August. Prices were forecast to remain flat. UK house prices continue to be 
supported by an ongoing shortage of properties for sale and solid growth in full-time employment, Russell Galley, 
managing director of Halifax Community Bank said.
----------
Permanent job placements in the UK grew at the weakest pace in five months in September, a report compiled by 
the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and IHS Markit showed Friday. The number of people placed in 
permanent jobs increased again in September, but the rate of expansion was the the slowest since April. 
Temporary or contracts staff placements also registered a marked growth in September. The availability of both 
permanent and temporary workers continued to fall sharply during September. As a result, permanent starting 
salaries rose at the second-steepest rate in 22 months, while temp pay growth softened only slightly from August's 
16-month record. On a regional basis, the strongest rise in permanent placements was recorded in the Midlands 
and the South of England. Meanwhile, London logged a moderate decline in permanent placements.
----------
Ireland's consumer confidence rose to an 18-month high in September largely on improved outlook on household 
finances, survey data from KBC Bank and Economic and Social Research Institute showed. The KBC Bank/ESRI 
consumer sentiment index rose to 105.8 from 102.9 in August. This was the highest reading since February 2016. 
The indicator signaled that confidence among Irish households remains on a positive if somewhat uneven path. 
"The September survey suggests Irish consumers may now see the economic glass as half-full but a still uncertain 
environment and limited gains in incomes mean it is far from overflowing," Austin Hughes, KBC Bank Ireland, said. 
The index of current conditions improved to 123.4 from 117.0 a month ago. Likewise, the index of consumer 
expectations came in at 94.0 versus 93.3 in August.
----------
Total labor cash earnings in Japan increased at a faster-than-expected pace in August, preliminary report from the 
Ministry of Health, Labor & Welfare showed. Gross earnings climbed 0.9% year-over-year in August, faster than the 
0.4% rise in July, which was revised from a 0.3% fall estimated previously. Economists had expected a 0.5% rise 
for August. Contractual gross earnings grew 0.6% annually in August and special cash earnings rose notably by 
6.1%. Real cash earnings edged up 0.1% in August, the same rate of increase as in the preceding month.
----------
House Republicans narrowly approved a USD4.1 trillion budget resolution on Thursday, taking a key step in efforts 
to pass their US tax reform plan. The House voted 219 to 206 to pass the budget, with all of the votes in favour of 
the resolution coming from the GOP side of the aisle. 18 Republicans joined with all of the Democrats in the 
chamber in voting against the resolution. The budget resolution includes major spending cuts but is largely seen as 
a vehicle for Republicans to enact tax reform. The bill unlocks the reconciliation process, allowing Republicans to 
pass tax reform with a simple 51-vote majority in the Senate. The Senate Budget Committee is expected to pass a 
similar bill later in the day, with the resolution due to be brought to the Senate floor in two weeks.
----------
US President Donald Trump plans to "decertify" the international nuclear deal with Iran in an announcement he will 
make next week just ahead of a deadline to report on whether Iran is complying with the agreement, according to 
US media reports Thursday. Trump is expected to state the agreement, reached in 2015 after years of negotiations 
between Iran and six world powers, is not in the national interest of the US, according to the reports. The decision 
stops short of the US completely scrapping the deal, but would open the door to modifying it, the Washington Post 
reported, quoting unidentified sources who have been briefed on the plans. White House spokeswoman Sarah 
Sanders said the president had made a decision on the agreement and would announce it "at the appropriate time," 
adding that his focus has been a comprehensive strategy on how to deal with Iran.
----------
The Spanish Constitutional Court ruled Thursday that a special session of Catalonia's regional parliament, called to 
discuss independence from Spain after a disputed referendum, is not permitted to go ahead as planned next week. 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK House Price Growth Accelerates In September
The Socialist Party of Catalonia, which is opposed to secession, filed a writ of protection with the high court, on the 
grounds that a declaration of independence would violate the constitution and "destroy" regional deputies' rights. 
The judgement came a day after the Catalan governing coalition called for Monday's session, which would set out 
the way forward after a 90% majority voted for independence in an unauthorized October 1 referendum. On 
Wednesday, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont criticized the Spanish government's unwillingness to accept a

LONDON (Alliance News) - Large-cap airline easyJet on Friday said it saw "record" passenger numbers and load 
factors in the summer of 2017, and now expects full-year profit to be at the upper end of its previous guidance.
However, the airline warned it expects ongoing pressure on yields as capacity in the wider market continues to 
grow, while foreign exchange will also have a material knock on profit for its recently-ended financial year.  
The budget carrier said that it continued to drive passenger and load factor growth in the three months ended 
September 30, with "record" passenger numbers of 24.1 million, which drove a load factor of 95.6%. 
The summer trading update follows on from Thursday, when easyJet reported growth in passenger numbers and 
load factor in the month of September and in the rolling 12 month period. Passenger numbers were up 11% in 
September to 7.7 million from 7.0 million in a year ago, whilst load factor was also up to 93.6% in the month from 
91.1%.
easyJet's September trading figures followed on from peers International Consolidated Airlines SA, which on 
Wednesday reported growth across the board at Aer Lingus, Iberia and British Airways in September, with group 
traffic rising 3.1% year-on-year and capacity rising 1.3%. 
On Tuesday Ryanair Holdings PLC reported a 10% growth in monthly traffic for September traffic despite its flight 
cancellations. The Irish low-cost airline said September traffic grew to 11.8 million customers, versus 10.8 million 
customers in the comparative period the prior year. September load factor was up 2 percentage points at 97%.
FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air Holdings PLC also reported September traffic figures on Tuesday, showing 26.4% growth 
for the month compared to the prior year. Wizz Air, a European budget airline, said September passenger numbers 
totalled 2.7 million versus 2.1 million in the prior year period. Load factor for the month rose by 1.3 percentage 
points to 92.9%.

easyJet shares were down 3.0% on Friday at 1,245.67 pence, the worst performer in the FTSE 100. Meanwhile, 
IAG was down 1.0% at 611.44 pence, Ryanair was down 1.5% at 16.72 pence and Wizz Air was down 0.6% at 
3,114.00 pence. 
Returning to the update on Friday, easyJet said passengers benefited in the summer from low fares across the 
network, particularly on beach markets from the UK.
This is reflected in a year-on-year reduction in revenue per seat at constant currency of 3.7% in the fourth quarter, 
resulting in a 1.4% decline for the second half of the year. Despite the decline, the airline said this was "slightly 
better than guidance due to high load factors and strong ancillary revenue performance."
Meanwhile, the headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency for the whole financial year is expected to 
be around 1.0% higher than the year before, in line with expectations. Including fuel, the cost is expected to decline 
4.4%. 
Isolating the fuel bill alone, easyJet expects total fuel costs to be GBP230 million to GBP235 million lower than the 
last financial year. 
Capacity in the final three months of the financial year to the end of September grew by 8%, with easyJet continuing 
to build market share and number one and number two positions at key airports.
"easyJet remains focused on cost and has continued to drive structural improvements, such as longer-term 
capacity-related deals with Airports. Planned investment in resilience in operations in the summer months has 
delivered operational improvement, particularly at Gatwick Airport," said the airline. 
As a result of the positive summer, easyJet said it expects headline pretax profit to be between GBP405 million to 
GBP410 million, towards the upper end of its full-year guidance. That is expected despite warning that foreign 
exchange movements are to drag headline pretax profit down by GBP100 million for the year. 
In July, easyJet said it expected headline pretax profit for the full year to be between GBP380 million and GBP420 
million, up 3.5% to 14% from its original target to deliver annual profit of GBP367 million. 
In the 2016 financial year, pretax profit amounted to GBP495 million, having sank 28% from the year before.
Meanwhile, net cash at the end of September is expected to be around GBP357 million, as it enters "a year of 
significant investment in new aircraft." 
Carolyn McCall, easyJet Chief Executive, said: "easyJet has finished the year with continued positive momentum 
delivering both a strong final quarter and a strong second half. Passenger numbers and load factor in the final 
quarter set new records and the second half profit was over GBP100 million higher than summer 2016.  
"The market continues to be challenging and easyJet has had to absorb a significant currency impact of GBP100 
million in the year. However, easyJet continues to operate Europe's strongest network and the current turmoil in the 
sector provides easyJet with opportunities to capitalise on its strong customer proposition and grow and strengthen 
our positions in Europe's leading airports still further," McCall added.
Looking forward, easyJet said it plans to grow capacity by around 6% for the financial year ending 2018, and added 
that revenue momentum continues to improve. However, whilst revenue momentum continues to improve, the 
airline said it expects continued pressure on yields reflecting ongoing market capacity growth that is currently 
forecast to be around 5% in the first quarter. 
The airline will publish its full-year results on November 21.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Flights were temporarily grounded at Stansted Airport after RAF jets were scrambled to 
escort a Ryanair flight.
A spokesman for the airport, in Essex, said police were on the scene after the passenger plane was diverted from 
its route between Kaunas, Lithuania, and Luton Airport, in Bedfordshire.
He added all flights had now resumed after being held for about ten minutes from 8.55am on Wednesday.
"Flights were briefly held while RAF Typhoons escorted the plane in.
"All flights are now operating as normal;. It was literally a momentary pause."
Essex Police tweeted: "We are aware of an incident at Stansted Airport. We will bring you more information when 
we can."
A spokesman for Ryanair Holdings PLC said: "This flight from Kaunas to London Luton diverted to London Stansted 
in line with procedures after Lithuanian authorities received a suspected hoax security alert.
"The aircraft landed normally at Stansted and customers will be transferred to Luton by coach when cleared to do 
so."
The jets were sent from RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire to intercept the flight, the Ministry of Defence said.
A sonic boom echoed across the Suffolk skyline when the jets were scrambled, Suffolk Police confirmed.
An RAF spokesman said: "The RAF can confirm Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon aircraft were launched this morning 
from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft.
"The aircraft was safely escorted to Stansted Airport. The Typhoon aircraft were authorised to transit at supersonic 
speed for operational reasons; any inconvenience caused to local residents is regretted."

Thousands of holidaymakers are being repatriated following the collapse of travel firm Monarch, which has left 
nearly 2,000 employees out of a job. More than 11,000 passengers were expected to depart for the UK by Monday 
night, less than 24 hours after the 50-year-old company went bust. While those already abroad await news of 
alternative flights back to the UK, a further three quarters of a million people who held future bookings with the firm 
have had their travel plans thrown into disarray. In a letter to staff, Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield said 
the "root cause" of the airline's plunging revenues was terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, as well as the 
"decimation" of the tourist trade in Turkey. The group's engineering operation, Monarch Aircraft Engineering, is not 
in administration and continues to trade normally.

Theresa May's attempt to break the deadlock in Brexit negotiations is expected to be rejected as insufficient by 
MEPs on the eve of her crunch speech to the Conservative Party conference. The UK prime minister last month 
travelled to Florence to make offers to the EU on withdrawal issues including a financial settlement, citizens' rights 
and the Irish border, in an effort to push talks on to a future trading relationship. But on Tuesday the European 
Parliament will debate and vote on a motion which states that the required "sufficient progress" has not yet been 
made for talks on a post-Brexit trade deal to begin. Britain had hoped to have advanced enough for EU leaders to 
green light trade discussions this month.

Stephen Paddock, the gunman believed to have killed at least 59 people and injured more than 500 in Las Vegas 
Sunday night, was a 64-year-old white man and US citizen. Police said they had "no working motive" for the 
shooting. Paddock had no police record and was not known to police for any prior acts of violence. The shots were 
fired from the window of a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Paddock checked into the room on 
Thursday. Paddock was dead when police officers stormed the room, leading police to believe he killed himself. 
The alleged shooter lived in a retirement community in Mesquite, about 130 kilometres from Las Vegas, described 
by police as "really quiet" and "a low-crime area."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Rivals have begun circling the carcass of collapsed airline Monarch in the hope of 
bagging its landing slots as the firm's administrator prepares to carve up its assets.
The likes of easyJet PLC, Wizz Air Holdings PLC, Norwegian Air Shuttle and British Airways-owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group SA are understood to be mulling moves for the carrier's slots, which span Manchester, 
Gatwick, Birmingham, Luton and Leeds-Bradford airports, according to people familiar with the matter.
It comes after Monarch's private equity owner Greybull called in administrators to the firm in the early hours of 
Monday morning.
Greybull cited a highly competitive market, terrorism and the collapse in the value of the pound as factors 
contributing to Monarch's demise.
Around 860,000 customers are affected by Monarch Airlines going into administration, the Civil Aviation Authority 
has said.
This includes 110,000 who are currently abroad and 750,000 with future bookings.
The Luton-based carrier, which was about to mark its 50th anniversary, went into administration early on Monday, 
triggering uncertainty for customers and a huge effort to get people already on holiday back to the UK.
The CAA said it had been asked by the government to charter more than 30 aircraft to bring the passengers home, 
with UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling calling it the "biggest peacetime repatriation" effort.
A sale of the group is not thought to be on the cards and it is likely that parts of the carrier, including its take-off and 
landing slots, fleet of aircraft and buildings, will be sold off piecemeal.
The entire process is expected to take between four to six weeks and it also means that the bulk of Monarch's 
2,100 staff are likely to face redundancy.
TOP NEWS: Airline Rivals Circle Monarch To Grab Landing Slots, Pilots
The collapse of the Luton-based airline, which was about to mark its 50th anniversary, has triggered uncertainty for 
customers and a huge effort to get people already on holiday back to the UK.
Robin Byde, transport analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said that Monarch's assets would be attractive to easyJet in 
particular.
"Monarch assets may enable easyJet to increase frequencies on common routes, gain more attractive year-round 
and seasonal slots, and generally take market share.
"On fleets, synergies could be attractive as Monarch currently operates 34 Airbus A320-family aircraft which are 
compatible with easyJet's fleet," he said.
However, Byde added that British competition authorities and the Civil Aviation Authority would scrutinise any deal 
closely.
Monarch's pilots are also expected to be sought after, but it is unlikely that Ryanair, which has been forced to 
cancel flights in recent weeks after miscalculating pilot leave, will be able to snap them up easily.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, said: "The pilots are also likely to be in demand, although Monarch's all-Airbus 
fleet means that they would not be available to relieve Ryanair's shortage (Ryanair operates an all-Boeing fleet)," 
referring to Ryanair Holdings PLC.
Commercial airline pilots require a "type rating" to fly a certain model of aircraft and, while they can hold more than 
one of these ratings at a time, it is unclear how many Monarch pilots hold the permission to fly Ryanair's fleet.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Cantor said easyJet is likely to bid for Monarch Airlines' assets following the holiday 
carrier's collapse into administration, marking another step in the consolidation for the European short-haul market.
easyJet was up 3.3% early Monday at 1,257.33 pence, the best large-cap performer. Cantor held its Buy rating on 
easyJet with a target price of 1,600 pence.
International Consolidated Airlines - which owns British Airlines - was up 2.0% at 605.50p, while mid-cap Wizz Air 
was up 3.0% at 2,948.00p, and London-listed Ryanair up 2.6% at EUR16.70.
Monarch entered into administration at 0400 BST on Monday, the biggest UK airline ever to cease trading. The 
carrier's troubles follow on from recent problems at other European airlines, such as Alitalia and Air Berlin.
Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August after its main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, withdrew 
financial aid for the loss-making carrier. Meanwhile, Italian flag carrier Alitalia went into administration for the 
second time in May, having not made a profit since 2002.
"Monarch's recent turnaround has clearly faltered, we think due to intense price competition in the European short-
haul leisure market, rising costs with weaker sterling and the impact on tourism due to terrorist attacks," Cantor 
analyst Robin Byde.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority on Monday said it has been asked by the government to charter more than 30 
aircraft to bring the passengers back to the UK after Monarch failed to renew a crucial licence.
Some 300,000 future bookings have been cancelled as a result of the company's failure, and customers have been 
told to keep away from airports as there will be no more flights.
The government has warned passengers to expect disruption and delay as it works to ensure there are enough 
flights to return the "huge number" of passengers.
IN THE KNOW: easyJet Likely To Snap Up Monarch's Assets - Cantor
"I have immediately ordered the country's biggest ever peacetime repatriation to fly about 110,000 passengers who 
could otherwise have been left stranded abroad," said UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling.
Cantor's Byde said Monarch appears to be a good potential fit for easyJet, adding that the London-listed low-cost 
airlines needs "a new source of growth following aggressive expansion at London Gatwick airport in recent years".
The airline is a smaller UK operator, Cantor said, flying to around 40 destinations compared with around 140 
destinations by easyJet. 
Cantor said it is unlikely Monarch will be sold as a single entity, with a break-up of its assets more likely. However, 
the broker said its working assumption is that an offer for Monarch as a single entity would have an enterprise value 
of GBP400 million, based on a multiple of ten times its most recent full-year profit. 
Other bidders, including IAG and Wizz Air, are likely to look at the airline's assets, Cantor said.
Byde said that, following analysis of the route maps for both Monarch and easyJet, the direct overlap "looks fairly 
limited". 
The analyst said Monarch flies to only 30% of the same destinations as easyJet, but the overlap occurs on some of 
the big routes, such as mainland Spain, the Canaries, Italy and Portugal. 
Cantor said Monarch's assets may enable easyJet to increase frequencies on common routes, gain more attractive 
year-round and seasonal slots, and generally take market share. In addition, Monarch flies from London Luton 
airport, which is home base for both Monarch and easyJet, and from London Gatwick, easyJet's largest base.
The analyst said fleet synergies could be attractive as Monarch currently operates 34 Airbus A320-family aircraft, 
which are compatible with easyJet's fleet. 
The airline also has a "well-regarded" aircraft engineering services business, Monarch Engineering Group, of which 
easyJet is already a customer. 
Cantor said the UK competition authorities and Civil Aviation Authority would likely scrutinize any deal closely due 
to concerns about market concentration.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European markets were mostly higher on Monday even as 
Spanish stocks fell amid a political crisis after Catalans voted in favor of independence in a contested referendum, 
plunging the EU into a new crisis.
The euro moved lower against the dollar after the violence-marred independence vote in Spain's Catalonia region.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.3% at 389.27 in late opening deals, with upbeat data from 
China, Japan and the euro zone supporting underlying sentiment.
Official data released over the weekend showed activity in China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest 
pace since 2012 in September, helping ease growth worries ahead of an upcoming political meeting next month.
Separately, Tankan survey results showed that Japanese business confidence among large manufacturers 
improved in the third quarter to the highest in a decade.
Closer home, final data from IHS Markit showed today that the euro area manufacturing sector grew the most in 
over six-and-a-half years in September.
The final manufacturing PMI climbed to a 79-month high of 58.1 from 57.4 in August, suggesting expansion for the 
fifty-first month in a row.
Investors shrugged off data from IHS Markit, which showed that the UK manufacturing sector continued to expand 
in September, albeit at a slower pace compared to August.
The German DAX was up 0.3% and France's CAC 40 was marginally higher, while the UK's FTSE 100 was up as 
much as 0.6%, led by housebuilders and airline stocks. Spain's IBEX was tumbling 1.4%, dragged down by banks 
with CaixaBank and Sabadell losing 4-6%.
European Shares Mostly Higher As Euro Falls After Catalonia Vote
Miners Antofagasta, Anglo American, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto gained 1-2% as copper futures edged 
up after upbeat economic data from China and Japan.
Shares of easyJet rallied 4.2%, Ryanair Holdings jumped 2.5% and Lufthansa climbed 3.2% after Monarch Airlines 
had been placed into administration.
British housebuilder Barratt Developments advanced 3.6% on expectations that the government will extend the 
'Help to Buy' scheme to stimulate the demand side of the housing market.
French ballpoint pens and razors maker BIC slumped 9.3% after cutting its 2017 sales forecast.
Building materials group CRH lost over 1% on a Bloomberg report that it is nearing an agreement to acquire 
Florida-based cement company Suwannee American Cement LLC from Votorantim Cimentos SA and Anderson 
Columbia Co.
Daily Mail & General Trust declined 2%. The newspapers publisher expects its full-year pretax profit to be at the 
lower end of market expectations.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets ended the first day of the new trading 
week in the green, extending their recent winning streak to eight straight sessions. Investors were encouraged by 
official data released over the weekend which showed activity in China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the 
fastest pace since 2012 in September.
The weakening of the Euro against the US dollar also provided a boost to the markets Monday. The currency 
dipped after Catalans voted in favor of independence in a contested referendum. In the weekend referendum, the 
Catalonian's voted to leave Spain. The weekend vote also turned violent, leaving over 800 people injured after 
clashes with police.
Euro area's economic recovery has been solid, broad-based and resilient, yet inflationary pressures remain 
subdued, European Central Bank Executive Board member Peter Praet said Monday.
"While we remain confident that inflation developments will eventually return to levels below, but close to, 2% our 
medium-term objective, the evidence still shows insufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of 
inflation towards those levels," Praet, who is also the ECB's chief economist, said in a speech in London.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.37%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.22%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 0.42%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.58% and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.39%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 
0.90% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.92%.
Airline stocks rallied on the news that Monarch Airlines has been placed into administration. Lufthansa climbed 
3.45% in Frankfurt, while easyJet rose 4.93% and Ryanair Holdings jumped 3.50% in London.
In Paris, ballpoint pen and razor maker BIC plunged 9.86% after cutting its 2017 sales forecast.
European Markets Continue To Rise As Euro Weakens
In London, CRH lost 0.92% on a Bloomberg report that it is nearing an agreement to acquire Florida-based cement 
company Suwannee American Cement LLC from Votorantim Cimentos SA and Anderson Columbia Co.
Daily Mail and General Trust declined 2.08%. The newspaper publisher expects its full-year pretax profit to be at 
the lower end of market expectations.
Barratt Developments advanced 4.23% on expectations that the government will extend the 'Help to Buy' scheme to 
stimulate the demand side of the housing market.
The euro area unemployment rate remained stable in August at the lowest level seen since early 2009, data from 
Eurostat showed Monday.
The jobless rate came in at 9.1% in August, the same rate as seen in July. This was the lowest rate since February 
2009. The rate was forecast to drop to 9%.
The euro area manufacturing sector grew the most in over six-and-a-half years in September, final data from IHS 
Markit showed Monday. The final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to a 79-month high of 58.1 in 
September from 57.4 in August. The flash score was 58.2.
The UK manufacturing sector continued to expand in September, albeit at a slower pace compared to August, data 
from IHS Markit showed Monday.
The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply factory Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-
expected to 55.9 in September from a 4-month high of 56.7 in August. The expected score was 56.2.
UK private sector growth slowed in three months to September, according to growth indicator released by the 
Confederation of British Industry. The balance of firms reporting an increase in output fell to +11% from +14% in 
three months to August.
Activity in the US manufacturing sector unexpectedly grew at a faster rate in the month of September, according to 
a report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Monday.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index climbed to 60.8 in September from 58.8 in August, with a reading 
above 50 indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had expected the index to dip to 50.8.
A report released by the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending in the US increased by 
more than expected in the month of August.
The Commerce Department said construction spending climbed 0.5% to USD1.218 trillion in August after plunging 
by 1.2% to USD1.212 trillion in July. Economists had expected spending to rise by 0.2%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The UK Civil Aviation Authority has told Ryanair Holdings PLC it has until 5 pm London 
time on Friday to meet obligations to thousands of customers affected by flight cancellations, Sky News reported.
The CAA has ordered Ryanair to tell passengers they are entitled to reimbursement of their expenses and to be 
rerouted with another carrier, as well as to commit to help passengers who have chosen an "unsuitable" option due 
after being mislead, according to Sky News.
The CAA has threatened legal action against Ryanair following the airline's failure to properly inform customers of 
their rights.
CAA Chief Executive Andrew Haines was said by Sky News to have been "furious" with the airline after it cancelled 
a further 18,000 flights over winter, affecting 400,000 people.
Sky News said the CAA has the right to take legal action on behalf of customers but not to suspend Ryanair's 
licence to operate.
The latest cancellations come after Ryanair said it would be cancelling flights because it had mishandled its staff 
holiday rota.

TALLINN (Alliance News) - The rights of airline passengers flying with Ryanair Holdings PLC "need to be 
protected," Ireland's prime minister said Friday, in the wake of the budget carrier cancelling thousands of flights.
Ryanair announced this month that it would cancel about 18,000 flights until the end of October to accommodate for 
a backlog of holidays for its crew.
On Wednesday, the airline said that it would also cut 25 planes, or 6% of its fleet, this winter as it slows its planned 
growth in light of the mass cancellations.
"I think it's as simple as this: people's and passengers' rights need to be protected," Irish Prime Minister Leo 
Varadkar said at the sidelines of an EU summit in Estonia.
"So, if anyone has had a flight cancelled, any airline, in this case Ryanair, needs to provide them with an alternative 
way of getting them where they need to go or refund them in full. I'd absolutely expect the airlines to do that."
He said he counted on Ireland's Commission of Aviation Regulation to make sure passengers' rights are upheld.
Ryanair said it met with the commission on Friday and agreed to implement measures to better inform customers of 
their rights and claims ahead of a deadline by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.
The airline said in a statement that it had emailed all affected customers clarifying their rights to refunds and re-
routing and compensation.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Friday it met with the Irish Commission 
for Aviation Regulation and has agreed to implement a series of steps to address the Commission's requirements.
The Commission requires that all customers affected by Ryanair's recent flight cancellations are aware of their 
EU261 rights and entitlements, including full refunds, or reaccommodation on other Ryanair flights or other 
transports options and expenses.
The steps Ryanair to which has agreed are to issue a clarification email to all affected customers explaining their 
rights; issue a press release explaining how and when they can be re-accommodated on other Ryanair or other 
airline flights; and updated the FAQ pages of its website to reflect all the changes made.
In addition, Ryanair has replied to the letter from the UK Civil Aviation Authority, agreeing to meet the requirements 
for customer clarification, in line with those requested by the Irish Commission.
"Ryanair has called upon the UK CAA to now require UK airlines to comply with these EU261 obligations which the 
CAA did not apply to British Airways in May this year, when a computer meltdown stranded hundreds of thousands 
of British citizens/visitors at London Heathrow and many other airports, with no apparent action taken by the CAA in 
respect of re-accommodation or enforcement against British Airways," Ryanair said in a statement.
British Airways is owned International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were down 0.3% at 16.34 pence on Friday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The UK Civil Aviation Authority has threatened legal action against Ryanair Holdings 
PLC over its recent flight cancellations for "persistently misleading passengers".
The CAA said Wednesday it has launched enforcement action against Ryanair following the airline's decision 
earlier this month to cancel thousands of flights. At that time, the CAA wrote to Ryanair to clarify their legal 
obligations, and sought assurances as to how and when passengers would be rerouted onto alternative flights.
The regulator told Ryanair to make a corrective public statement to ensure customers were not misled, and had 
"accurate comprehensive information" related to their rights and entitlements.
Ryanair then on Wednesday announced thousands more cancellations to its scheduled winter flying schedule, and 
the CAA said the airline had "again failed to provide customers with the necessary and accurate information relating 
to their passenger rights, particularly around rerouting and care and assistance entitlements, which includes 
expenses".
Ryanair said the cancellations were required due to troubles with holiday allocation for its pilots and cabin crew. 
Ryanair said Wednesday that slower growth going forward will create "lots of spare aircraft and crews" across its 86 
bases this winter.
The CAA is expediting enforcement action against Ryanair and is separately continuing to investigate the airlines 
re-routing policy. 
"There are clear laws in place, which are intended to assist passengers in the event of a cancellation, helping 
minimise both the frustration and inconvenience caused by circumstances completely out of their control," said CAA 
Chief Executive Andrew Haines in a statement.
"We have made this crystal clear to Ryanair, who are well aware of their legal obligations, which includes how and 
when they should reroute passengers, along with the level of information it provides its passengers.  The 
information Ryanair published today again fails to makes this clear," Haines said, adding, "in expediting our

enforcement action we are seeking to ensure that Ryanair's customers will receive the correct and necessary 
information, to make an informed choice about an alternative flight."

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks steadied on Thursday after five sessions of 
gains, even as banks rallied on expectations for higher interest rates going forward.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was marginally lower at 385.57 in late opening deals after rising 0.4% 
in the previous session.
The German DAX was moving up 0.3%, France's CAC 40 was rising 0.2% and the UK's FTSE 100 was up 0.1%.
Lenders Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole and Barclays climbed 1-4% on the back of higher bond

The day's economic reports proved to be a mixed bag. German consumer confidence is set to weaken in October, 
but consumers still believe the economy will continue to contribute significantly to overall economic development, 
survey data from market research group GfK showed.
The forward-looking consumer sentiment index fell unexpectedly to 10.8 from 10.9 in September.
A gauge of Euro zone economic sentiment improved more than expected in September to reach levels last seen in 
July 2007, data from the European Commission revealed.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets were stuck in a narrow range 
throughout Thursday's session, but managed to log slight increases. The markets extended their winning streak to 
six straight days. Bank stocks were among the top gainers of the session on expectations for interest rate hikes 
from the Federal Reserve. Retailers were also in focus, following the disappointing results reported by H&M.
The Bank of Spain warned on Thursday that the political tensions surrounding the referendum being held for 
Catalonia's independence could hurt economic activity.
Catalonia is set to hold the referendum on October 1.
"Regarding the risks to the growth forecasts, political tensions in Catalonia could possibly affect confidence, 
spending decisions and financing conditions," the bank said in its quarterly report.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.13%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks

above the expected 112.
German consumer confidence is set to weaken in October, survey data from the market research group GfK 
showed Thursday. The forward-looking consumer sentiment index fell unexpectedly to 10.8 from 10.9 in 
September. The score was forecast to rise to 11.0.
Germany's inflation remained unchanged at its highest level in four months in September, preliminary data from 
Destatis showed Thursday. The consumer price index rose 1.8% year-on-year, same as in August, and in line with 
economists' expectations.
Economic activity in the US increased by slightly more than previously estimated in the second quarter, the 
Commerce Department revealed in a report on Thursday.
The report said gross domestic product jumped by 3.1% in the second quarter compared to the previously 
estimated 3.0% growth. Economists had expected the pace of GDP growth to be unrevised.
After reporting unexpected decreases in first-time claims for US unemployment benefits in the two previous weeks, 
the Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing a rebound in initial jobless claims in the week ended 
September 23.
The report said initial jobless claims rose to 272,000, an increase of 12,000 from the previous week's revised level 
of 260,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 270,000 from the 259,000 originally reported for the 
previous week.

Ryanair Reduces Winter Flying Schedule To Prevent Future Cancellations

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it will slow growth this winter by flying 25 
less aircraft from November and 10 fewer planes from next April.
The Irish budget airline said this will eliminate the risk of further flight cancellations, after earlier this month it was 
forced to cancel between 40 and 50 flights daily until the end of October due to troubles with holiday allocation for 
its pilots and cabin crew.
Ryanair said Wednesday slower growth going forward will create "lots of spare aircraft and crews" across its 86 
bases this winter.
In addition, reducing its flying schedule will allow it to roster all extra pilot leave necessary in October, November 
and December to meet the Irish Aviation Authority's requirement to complete a nine-month annual leave transition 
period, so it can start a new calendar leave year from January 1 with no backlog.
The low-cost carrier said it will roster almost 40% of the annual pilot leave requirement for 2018 in the first quarter, 
removing the risk of roster problems recurring next year.
It will also roll out a series of low fare seat sales for winter 2017 and said it is "confident" there will be no further 
roster-related cancellations.
According to Ryanair, it has less than 400,000 customers booked on to the flights from November, affecting less 
than one flight per day over the five-month winter period.
Less than 1% of the 50 million customers Ryanair will carry this winter are affected, and every one of these 
customers has now received an email giving them between five weeks and five months notice of the schedule 
changes, Ryanair said, offering them alternative flights or full refunds of their airfare.
Customers have also received a EUR40, or EUR80 return, travel voucher which will allow them to book, during 
October, a flight on any Ryanair service between October and March 2018.
Ryanair Reduces Winter Flying Schedule To Prevent Future Cancellations
Ryanair said it has also emailed each of the 315,000 customers whose flights were previously cancelled over the 
six-week period in September and October, offering them the same travel voucher, again for travel between 
October and March 2018. This flight voucher is in addition to the flight re-accommodation/refunds those customers 
received last week.
The airline noted the slower rate of growth will reduce traffic this year and next, with monthly growth from November 
to March to slow to 4% from 9%. Full-year traffic will decrease to 129 million from 131 million, which is still up 7.5% 
year-on-year.
By slowing its summer 2018 fleet growth to 435 from 445 aircraft, it expects traffic to March 2019 to slow to 138 
million from 142 million, which is up 7% year-on-year.
Ryanair expects the total cost of the flight cancellations for September and October to be under EUR25 million, with 
the cost of the free flight vouchers to be the same amount. It expects "slightly" lower yields over the next two 
months as it promotes seat sales, but said this will not alter its current full-year guidance of EUR1.40 billion to 
EUR1.45 billion post-tax profit.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 1.8% at EUR16.76 on Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UBS said low-cost airline easyJet is the most suitable substitute in the UK for Ryanair, 
and will likely benefit from the Irish carrier's recent staffing failure.
easyJet was the best large-cap performer on Tuesday, up 2.7% at 1,212.00 pence. The stock is up 20% so far in 
2017. Shares in Ryanair were up 0.4% at EUR16.44 on Tuesday, while International Consolidated Airlines was 
down 0.3% at 585.00 pence.
UBS analyst Jarrod Castle said easyJet is "the greatest substitute" for Ryanair in the UK, its customer base 
overlapping more with the Irish-based airline than British Airways, which is owned by International Consolidated 
Airlines.
Using data drawn from a panel of consumer spending accounts, UBS said Ryanair customers are more likely to 
also fly with easyJet than they are with BA.
In the twelve months ended June 30, 37% of Ryanair customers spending over GBP10 also spent over GBP10 at 
easyJet, while only 17% spent over GBP10 at BA.
For the same period, 31% of customers spending over GBP100 at Ryanair spent the same amount with easyJet, 
while only 15% spent over GBP100 with BA.
Accordingly, UBS said it thinks easyJet will benefit from recent staffing issues that Ryanair has faced.
Ryanair earlier in September said it would be cancelling around 40 to 50 flights daily for the next six weeks, until the 
end of October, to improve its system-wide punctuality.
"Ryanair is not short of pilots - we were able to fully crew our peak summer schedule in June, July and August - but 
we have messed up the allocation of annual leave to pilots in September and October because we are trying to 
allocate a full year's leave into a nine-month period from April to December," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said 
last week.
IN THE KNOW: UBS Says easyJet To Benefit From Ryanair Roster Failure
"This issue will not recur in 2018 as Ryanair goes back onto a 12-month calendar leave year from January 1 to 
December 31 2018," O'Leary added.
The Ryanair boss said it was "a mess of our own making".
UBS noted the median single amount spend for a BA customer is 18% greater than the
median spend for an easyJet customer, while easyJet median spend is in turn 89% greater than the median spend 
of a Ryanair customer. 
Castle said concerns about a UK consumer aviation spend slowdown are not evident, adding that at UBS's travel 
conference in September, the European airlines under its coverage "confirmed an in-line to better summer travel 
season".
UBS kept its Buy rating on easyJet, and added that the firm's capital market's day on Wednesday should be "a 
positive catalyst for the shares".

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is "rushing" to recruit 120 new pilots to avoid the prospect of 
further cancelled flights, Sky News reported Thursday.
Sky said the announcement was made at the budget carrier's annual general meeting in Dublin on Thursday just 
hours after pilots rejected Ryanair's offer of a cash bonus to forfeit holiday. 
Sky News reported one clause saying pilots had to have logged 800 flying hours over the past year would have 
made most ineligible for the bonus. It said the pilots feel the offer was also too vague, particularly concerning how 
much holiday time pilots would actually have to give up to earn the bonus.
The airline had previously dismissed reports that the loss of 140 pilots to Norwegian low-cost airline Norwegian Air 
Shuttle ASA contributed to cancellations.
Sky News noted the airline is coming under increasing pressure after it cancelled 2,100 flights during September 
and October, affecting 315,000 passengers, with investors becoming increasingly worried about the airline's 
industrial relations.

Ryanair said last week it would have to cancel around 40 to 50 flights a day until the end of October, with Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary admitting the cancellations were caused by a "mess-up" of its rota system.
Earlier this week, it said it expected to process 300,000 reroute or refunds requests by the weekend of September 
23/24, meaning 95% of all those affected would have been processed within six days of finding out their flight was 
cancelled.
Ryanair offered captains GBP12,000 or EUR12,000 and first officers GBP6,000 or EUR6,000 to forego holiday to 
help alleviate cancellations, but on Thursday the BBC reported this had been rejected by 17 of the company's 80 or 
so employee councils.

Pilots are instead demanding new, full-time contracts as well as an improvement in working conditions, with the new 
contracts aimed at stopping an exodus of pilots to rival airlines, the BBC said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - A group of Ryanair pilots have rejected the offer of a cash bonus to work extra days 
after the airline "messed up" crew holidays, the BBC reported Thursday.
The BBC said it has seen a letter in which pilot representatives from 17 of the company's 80 or so European bases 
have told bosses they will not accept the bonus.
Instead, it reports they want new contracts and better working conditions.
Ryanair had offered captains a one-off payment of GBP12,000 or EUR12,000 and first officers GBP6,000 or 
EUR6,000 to work extra days to alleviate the impact of the airline's cancellation of 2,100 flights over the rest of 
September and through October.
The letter, which the BBC said comes from staff all over Europe, reportedly says new contracts will stop the large 
exodus of Ryanair pilots to competitors.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Analyst UBS kept its Neutral rating on Ryanair Holdings, estimating the profit and loss 
impact from the recent scandal regarding flight cancellations after a rota mix-up will not hit full year guidance.
UBS expects the financial impact of cancelled flights over the next six weeks to be under EUR5 million on profits, 
and costs from the European Union's Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004 regarding flight delay 
compensation to be under EUR20.0 million. It said all passengers are able to reschedule flights, and Ryanair will be 
able to meet EU261 compensation requirements.
UBS said the cost of the issue will be met in the second quarter and will not impact full year guidance.
It said, however, that Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary accepts manageable immediate financial impact 
could be offset by potential reputational damage, which could hit pricing despite forward bookings being up. 
UBS said O'Leary has admitted to an "own goal" with crewing issues caused by mismanagement of staff leave. The 
mistake was caused, UBS said, due to Ryanair moving from a calendar leave period to a fiscal leave period, 
impacting rostering. 
UBS said difficulties will occur over the rest of September and October after Ryanair decided to take out some lines 
of flying, with 40-50 flights per day cancelled.
With a schedule of around 2,500 daily flights this represents less than 2% of of the total daily flights, and less than 
0.5% of passengers for the year. 
UBS said the outcome of last week's European Court of Justice ruling that Ryanair staff can take disputes to local 
courts when Ryanair sought to force them to use Irish courts will not change the fact that crew fly under Irish law. 
Irish contracts comply, it said, with nearly all EU rules. 
It said O'Leary has confirmed the ruling will not lead to an increase in pay or unionisation, and Ryanair's self-
employment model will also not be impacted.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday it expects to have processed over 300,000 
alternative routings or refunds for customers by the end of the week, over 95% of the total affected by flight 
cancellations.
Ryanair expects to have accommodated over 175,000 of its customers on other Ryanair flights, over 55% of 
affected customers.
It said more than 63,000 flight refunds will have been processed by the end of Wednesday, over 20% of those 
affected. 
This would mean almost all customers will have had a re-routing or refund processed within six days of receiving 
notice of flight cancellations. All 315,000 affected customers received email notice on Monday 18th advising them 
on flight changes and offering alternative routes, refunds, and the European Union's Flight Compensation 
Regulation 261/2004 which governs flight delay compensation.
Ryanair also said it has taken on extra customer service staff to expedite the backlog of flight change requests and 
refunds.
Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said: "We apologise sincerely to each and every one of the 
315,000 customers whose original flights were cancelled over a 6 week period in September and October, while we 
work to resolve this short term rostering failure."
"We have taken on extra customer service teams to speed up the rate at which we accommodate and action 
alternative flight requests or refund applications. We expect to have the vast majority of these completed by the end 
of this week," Jacobs said.
"The vast majority of these requests are being dealt with online, but as our call centres and chat lines are extremely 
busy, we ask affected customers to bear with us as we do everything we can to respond to their requests and try to 
resolve any problems we have created for them, for which we again sincerely apologise," Jacobs added.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets ended Wednesday's session with 
mixed results, but were little changed overall. Investors were reluctant to make any major moves ahead of today's 
policy decision from the Federal Reserve. 
The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged when it concludes its meeting later today, although 
traders will pay close attention to the accompanying statement for clues about the outlook for policy. The statement 
may offer details on how the central bank plans to start shrinking its USD4.5 trillion balance sheet.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.11%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip

Producer prices increased 2.6% year-on-year in August, faster than the 2.3% rise seen in July.
UK retail sales grew the most in four months in August as consumers spend more despite higher inflation, 
vindicating a possible stimulus withdrawal in the months ahead.
According to data published by the Office for National Statistics, the retail sales volume including auto fuel 
advanced 1% in August from July, the biggest growth in four months, exceeding the expected rate of 0.2% and 
July's increase of 0.6%.
With strained supply levels continuing to subdue overall activity, the National Association of Realtors released a

NAR said existing home sales slumped by 1.7% to an annual rate of 5.35 million in August after tumbling by 1.3% 
to a rate of 5.44 million in July.
The continued decrease surprised economists, who had expected existing home sales to edge up to an annual rate 
of 5.46 million.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The Guardian reported Tuesday that Ryanair Holdings PLC has offered its pilots a one-

The newspaper said it has seen an internal memo offering pilots and first officers tax-free bonuses of GBP12,000

Chief Executive Michael O'Leary apologised this week after announcing up to 50 flights a day would be cancelled 
until October 31, affecting around 400,000 passengers.
The Guardian said that, not only is Ryanair facing customer anger, but has been warned by the Civil Aviation 
Authority that it could face penalties for failing to reroute passengers with other airlines.
The newspaper noted the budget airline could face further disruption with the possibility of strike action by pilots.

UK Conservatives At Odds Over How To Leave EU Ahead Of May's Speech

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ahead of a much-anticipated speech on Brexit by a weakened British Prime Minister 
Theresa May on Friday, differences among Conservative colleagues continue to hamper her efforts to negotiate the 
terms of leaving the European Union, analysts say.
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken pro-EU chief executive of Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, recently joined 
a growing number of critics who feel May's Brexit negotiations are "going nowhere".
"They are a bit of a shambles, and they need a bit of leadership," O'Leary told Sky News.
Ahead of May's much-anticipated Brexit speech in Florence on Friday, speculation is mounting over whether the 
under-pressure prime minister or a rival inside her Conservative party could try to provide that leadership.
In what many analysts see as the latest sign of division, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - a leadership contender 
before May won the race to replace David Cameron in July 2016 - set out his personal "vision for a bold, thriving 
Britain enabled by Brexit" in The Times on Saturday.
Johnson revived the controversial claim, first used by the Leave campaign he led into last year's Brexit referendum, 
that leaving the EU could save Britain more than GBP350 million per week to be spent on public services.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd accused Johnson of attempting to position himself as a "back-seat driver" of Brexit, 
while David Norgrove, head of the government's statistics office, wrote an open letter complaining that Johnson's 
weekly total of GBP350 million "confuses gross and net contributions" to the EU and was "a clear misuse of official 
statistics".
Johnson rejected Norgrove's criticism and said he was "looking forward" to May's speech in Florence.
"All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit," he wrote on Twitter.
UK Conservatives At Odds Over How To Leave EU Ahead Of May's Speech
But Colin Talbot, a professor of government at Manchester and Cambridge universities, said it appears that 
Johnson "wants to position himself as Leader of the Hard Brexit Brigade for the leadership battle to come."
The Conservatives are in "almost open civil war," while their main rivals, Labour, are in "suppressed civil war," 
Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said on Monday.
"Boris is Boris," May told reporters travelling with her to Canada on Monday. "This government is driven from the 
front and we are all going to the same destination," she said.
"We are all agreed as a government about the importance of ensuring the right deal for Britain, the right withdrawal 
agreement but also the right deal on a special partnership between the EU and UK for the future."
Despite her recent insistence that she is "not a quitter" and will lead the Conservatives into another general election 
in 2022, Simon Usherwood, a Brexit-focussed political analyst at the University of Surrey, said she remains "a dead 
woman walking."
That has been the view of many observers since May called a disastrous snap election in June.
She surprisingly lost her parliamentary majority in the election, amid a surge in support for left-wing Labour leader 
Jeremy Corbyn, forcing her to rely on backing from 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist 
Party in key votes.
"She's fatally compromised herself with the party, and the party is not a sympathetic organization," Usherwood told 
dpa.
It would take a "pretty astounding turnaround" for May to remain the long-term leader, he said.
"I think at this point it's convenient to keep her in [office], because if things are looking bad she may as well take the 
blame, and then the new person comes in and cleans up and gets a bounce off that," Usherwood said.
UK Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has promoted a "pro-business" Brexit with strong transitional arrangements to 
protect the economy after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, and Liam Fox, a pro-Brexit trade minister who 
argues that Britain could survive leaving the EU with no deal, wrote a joint article last month that was seen as a 
show of unity by the Conservatives.
Britain will definitely leave the EU customs union and single market but could agree a "time-limited" transition to 
"give business greater certainty," Hammond and Fox wrote in The Telegraph.
But Usherwood said their intervention failed to hide the cracks in party unity.
"You're still getting the different views coming through from individuals," he said.
"They might have patched things over for that [article] but there's still lots that they don't agree on."
Usherwood said he saw "no consensus view in cabinet or in senior levels of the Tory party."
"So it's the same problem that there's been all the way since last June: There's no plan; and even if there were a 
plan, there's nobody who's got a clear ability to make it happen."

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets fluctuated between small gains and 
losses over the course of Tuesday's session and ended the day with mixed results. The markets finished little 
changed overall, as investors exercised caution ahead of Wednesday's policy decision from the Federal Reserve.
The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged when it concludes its policy meeting after the 
European close tomorrow. However, traders will be looking for clues about the outlook for monetary policy.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.04%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.12%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 0.09%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.02% and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.16%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 
0.30% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.50%.
In Frankfurt, Hugo Boss dropped 3.64% after Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock to "Underweight" 
from "Equal-weight."
In London, Ocado Group sank 2.25%. The online grocery delivery company reported higher sales in its third 
quarter, but signaled a further hit to earnings from costs of setting up new distribution centers.
Budget airline Ryanair rose 1.32% after halting talks on a flight connection agreement with Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Heineken NV tumbled 3.77% in Amsterdam after Mexico's Femsa said it had sold a 5.24% stake in the world's 
second largest brewer for EUR2.5 billion.
Solvay dropped 1.36% in Brussels. The multi-specialty chemical company has entered into a binding agreement 
with German chemical company BASF for the sale of its Polyamides business for an enterprise value of EUR1.6 
billion.
European Markets Finished Mixed As Traders Await Fed Announcement
Telia Company rose 2.68% in Stockholm after the telecom operator sold about 153.5 million shares in Turkcell 
Iletism Hizmetleri A.S.
The euro area current account surplus increased in July on higher primary income, the European Central Bank 
reported Tuesday. The current account surplus increased to a seasonally adjusted EUR25.1 billion in July from 
EUR22.8 billion in June.
Eurozone construction output increased for the second straight month in July, and at a stable pace, data from 
Eurostat showed Tuesday. Construction output climbed 0.2% month-over-month in July, the same rate of rise as in 
June, which was revised from a 0.5% decrease reported earlier.
Germany's economic confidence strengthened notably in September, survey data from the Mannheim-based 
Centre for European Economic Research/ZEW showed Tuesday. The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment rose 
by 7 points to 17.0 in September. The score was forecast to rise to 13.
The French government downgraded the budget deficit projections for this year and next, the Finance Ministry said 
Tuesday. The government currently forecast a deficit of 2.9% of gross domestic product for 2017 and 2.6% for 
2018.
New residential construction in the US unexpectedly decreased in the month of August, according to a report 
released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday. The report said housing starts fell by 0.8% to an annual rate of 
1.180 million in August from a revised 1.190 million in July. Economists had expected housing starts to jump by 
1.7%.
The report also said building permits, an indicating of future housing demand, spiked by 5.7% to a rate of 1.300 
million in August from a rate of 1.230 million in July.
A report released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed increases in US import and export prices in the 
month of August.
The Labor Department said imports prices climbed by 0.6% in August after edging down by 0.1% in July. 
Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.4%.
The report said export prices also rose by 0.6% in August following a 0.5% increase in the previous month. Export 
prices had been expected to edge up by 0.2%.

IN THE KNOW: Liberum Positive On Ryanair Despite Flight Cancellations

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum reiterated its Buy rating on Ryanair Holdings saying the flight cancellations by 
the Irish airline were a disappointing and embarrassing operational mistake but it sees no severe impacts on 
Ryanair's market position in the long term. 
The broker also kept its price target at EUR21.00. Ryanair shares were down 2.3% at EUR16.75 Monday. 
Ryanair late Friday said it would be cancelling around 40 to 50 flights daily for the next six weeks, until the end of 
October, to improve its system-wide punctuality.
Punctuality had fallen below 80% in the first two weeks of September, hit by a combination of ATC capacity delays 
and strikes, weather disruptions, and increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew as the airline moves to 
allocate annual leave during a nine-month transition period to move its holiday year in line with the calendar year 
from the beginning of 2018.
Ryanair said it had operated at record schedule and traffic levels in the peak months of July and August, but has a 
backlog of leave that must be allocated before the end of the year in order to be able to switch to a calendar leave 
year at the beginning of 2018.
Tighter crewing numbers and ATC capacity restrictions in the UK, Germany and Spain, as well as strikes in France 
and thunderstorms, gave rise to "significant delays" in recent weeks, leading Ryanair's on-time performance to 
decline to under 80% from 90% over the past two weeks.
The airline apologised "sincerely" for the inconvenience caused by this, and said customers would be contacted 
directly about the small number of cancellations and offered alternatives or full refunds.
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said the development is a "disappointing and embarrassing operational mistake" for 
Ryanair. Khoo said he sees a modest adverse financial impact from refunded tickets and compensation costs as a 
result of the flight cancellations. 
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Positive On Ryanair Despite Flight Cancellations
However, the analyst argued that there ultimately should be no impact on the airline's strong long-term 
fundamentals or market position.
"The switch to the less-intensive winter timetable from the end of October should help. At the very least, Ryanair 
can adjust its future timetables to better match the available pilot resources," Khoo said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it has published the full list of 
the flight cancellations it first announced last Friday, noting that only 2% of customers will be affected.
Last Friday, Ryanair said it will cancel around 40 to 50 flights daily for the next six weeks, until the end of October, 
to improve its system-wide punctuality.
Punctuality fell below 80% in the first two weeks of September, hit by a combination of air traffic control capacity 
delays and strikes, weather disruptions, and increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew as the airline 
moves to allocate annual leave during a 9-month transition period to move its holiday year in line with the calendar 
year from the beginning of 2018.
On Monday, the low-cost carrier said over 98% of its customers will be unaffected by the "less than 50 per day" 
flight cancellations between Thursday and October 31.
Ryanair noted that the cancellations have been allocated, where possible, to its bigger base airports and routes with 
multiple daily frequencies so that it can offer disrupted customers the maximum number of alternate flights and 
routes in order to minimise inconvenience to them.
Customers affected by the cancellations will be emailed with offers of alternative flights on the same or next day, or 
full refunds if they choose not to take an alternative flight, plus details of their EU261 compensation entitlement, the 
airline said.
The airports where one line of flying will be removed for the next six weeks include: Barcelona, Brussels Charleroi, 
Dublin, Lisbon, Madrid, Milan Bergamo, Porto and Rome Fiumicino. London Stansted will have two lines of flying 
removed, out of 41.
"Ryanair is not short of pilots - we were able to fully crew our peak summer schedule in June, July and August - but 
we have messed up the allocation of annual leave to pilots in September and October because we are trying to 
allocate a full year's leave into a nine-month period from April to December. This issue will not recur in 2018 as 
Ryanair Publishes List Of Cancelled Flights Affecting 2% Of Customers
Ryanair goes back onto a 12-month calendar leave year from January 1 to December 31 2018," Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary said.
"This is a mess of our own making. I apologise sincerely to all our customers for any worry or concern this has 
caused them over the past weekend. We have only taken this decision to cancel this small proportion of our 2,500 
daily flights so that we can provide extra standby cover and protect the punctuality of the 98% of flights that will be 
unaffected by these cancellations," he added.
Shares in Ryanair were down 2.4% at EUR16.73 on Monday.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks hit six-week high on Monday, with Portugal 
shares leading the surge amid a rally in euro-area peripheral bonds after S&P Global Ratings raised Portugal's 
credit rating to investment grade with a stable outlook.
Easing of geopolitical tension and fading expectations for Fed tightening this year also supported underlying 
sentiment.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.35% at 382.03 in late opening deals after rising as much as 
1.3% last week to post its best weekly gain since July.
The German DAX, France's CAC 40 index and the UK's FTSE 100 were up between 0.3% and 0.4%, while 
Portugal's PSI 20 index was up as much as 1.5%.
Utilities EDF and Fortum jumped around 2% each after an upgrade by Goldman Sachs.
BAE Systems jumped almost 3% in London on signing a deal to supply 24 Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar.
Ryanair lost 2.6% after the low-cost airline announced plans to cancel between 40 and 50 flights every day up until 
20 September.
Fingerprint plunged 21% after the Swedish smartphone component maker warned of lower revenue in the third 
quarter, saying fingerprints is currently experiencing a cautious market.
In economic releases, Eurozone inflation climbed to a four-month high in August, as initially estimated, final data 
from Eurostat showed today.
Consumer prices advanced 1.5% year-on-year in August, faster than the 1.3% increase seen in July. This was the 
highest since April and in line with the estimate published on August 31.

Nonetheless, inflation continues to stay well below the European Central Bank's target of 'below, but close to 2%'.

House prices in the UK were down 1.2% on month in September, property tracking website Rightmove said on 
Monday. That follows the 0.9% decline in August, and it marks the third monthly drop in four months.

Monday showing a bigger than expected drop in US homebuilder confidence in the month of September.The report 
said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 64 in September from a downwardly revised 67 in 
August. Economists had expected the housing market index to edge down to 67 from the 68 originally reported for

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - The European Commission on Monday warned low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings 
PLC to comply with EU laws on passengers' rights after the operator announced that it would cancel more than 
2,000 flights until the end of October.
Ryanair said on Friday it would cancel 40 to 50 flights each day in the coming six weeks to accommodate for a 
backlog of holidays for its crew - noting that the cancellations were meant to "improve [the company's] system-wide 
punctuality".
"It is not for the Commission to comment on the operational decisions by airlines, but we expect Ryanair to comply 
with the European rules on passengers' rights," said Enrico Brivio, a spokesman for the European Commission.
Under EU laws passed in 2004, airlines have to notify passengers of cancellations at least two weeks in advance. If 
the cancelled flight is within two weeks, the airline needs to offer to re-route travellers on planes that depart within 
up to two hours from the originally scheduled flights.
If the airline fails to do this, passengers are entitled for compensation.
The European Commission noted that it was up to national authorities to enforce the EU regulation.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC late Friday said it will be cancelling around 40 to 50 flights daily 
for the next six weeks, until the end of October, to improve its system-wide punctuality.
Punctuality has fallen below 80% in the first two weeks of September, hit by a combination of ATC capacity delays 
and strikes, weather disruptions, and increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew as the airline moves to 
allocate annual leave during a 9 month transition period to move its holiday year in line with the calendar year from 
the beginning of 2018.
Ryanair said it had operated at record schedule and traffic levels in the peak months of July and August, but has a 
backlog of leave that must be allocated before the end of the year in order to be able to switch to a calendar leave 
year at the beginning of 2018.
Tighter crewing numbers, ATC capacity restrictions in the UK, Germany and Spain, as well as strikes in France and 
thunderstorms, has given rise to "significant delays" in recent weeks, leading Ryanair's on-time performance to 
decline to under 80% from 90% over the past two weeks.
Ryanair said that, by reducing its scheduled flying programme over the next six weeks by "less than 2%", it will 
create additional standby aircraft, and help restore on-time performance to its 90% average.
The airline apologised "sincerely" for the inconvenience caused by this, and said customers would be contacted 
directly about the small number of cancellations and offered alternatives or full refunds.
"We apologise sincerely to the small number of customers affected by these cancellations, and will be doing our 
utmost to arrange alternative flights and/or full refunds for them," said Ryanair's Head of Communications Robin 
Kiely in a statement.
Shares in Ryanair closed down 1.7% at EUR17.11 on Friday.

Ryanair Welcomes Labour Jurisdiction Ruling In 'Mons' Court Case
Ryanair Welcomes Labour Jurisdiction Ruling In 'Mons' Court Case

LONDON (Alliance News) - Airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday welcomed a ruling in its favour from the 
European Court of Justice upholding existing European Union rules on the jurisdiction of member states national 
court's.  
The ruling on the 'Mons' case rejected an argument from the CTC Union that the home base - referring to where 
crew start and end their work day - could be the sole determinant of what court jurisdiction can hear disputes on 
labour issues.
The court ruled that all current factors, such as where the worker gets their instructions, where goods and 
passengers are loaded and unloaded, among others, should continue to be considered as part of an overall 
assessment in determining jurisdiction.
This does not change the current status quo for Irish contracts of employment for Ryanair crew based across 
Europe, and the airline said it will continue to employ its crew under these contracts.
"We welcome this 'Mons' case ruling which upholds the existing EU rules on the jurisdiction of Member States 
national courts, and accepts Ryanair's position that just one criteria (ie basing) cannot unilaterally determine 
jurisdiction. Maintaining broad assessment criteria ensures that the most appropriate jurisdiction should apply in 
cases involving international transport workers rather than a sole criterion approach, which would narrow the 
assessment and restrict movement and flexibility with a myriad of regulations and different crews throughout 
Europe," said Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson in a statement.
"We do not believe this 'Mons' ruling will in any way alter our Irish contracts of employment or the union rights which 
all of our people enjoy under the protection of the Irish Constitution," Wilson added.
Shares in Ryanair were down 3.5% at EUR17.35 on Thursday.

IN THE KNOW: Liberum Cautious On easyJet's New Connections Initiative
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Cautious On easyJet's New Connections Initiative
Alliance News
September 13, 2017 Wednesday 2:21 PM GMT

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum reiterated its Sell rating on easyJet saying the budget airline's new airline 
connections initiative does offer some incremental revenue, but remains cautious on upside in the short term.
The broker kept its price target at 1,100 pence. Shares were up 1.8% at 1,216.00p, the best performer in the FTSE 
100.
easyJet on Wednesday launched a new airline connections service, "Worldwide by easyJet", intended to allow 
customers to "seamlessly" connect their easyJet flight with partner airline flights.
The service will allow easyJet passengers to connect with other easyJet flights through Gatwick Airport, south of 
London.
Launch partners for the service are fellow budget carriers WestJet Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle at Gatwick 
Airport, and easyJet intends to sign other airlines up to the service, with talks already "far advanced with middle-
eastern and far eastern carriers", among others.
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said the choice of Gatwick for the initial launch of connecting flights is logical. Gatwick 
is easyJet's largest base, has a growing number of long-haul flights from airlines with no other connection options 
and also offers an existing service that facilitates connections for passengers that are self-connecting, he added. 
"easyJet has demonstrated the first hurdle can be cleared (arguably with a more challenging starting point due to its 
greater reliance on bespoke technology). In our view, the second could be mitigated by enforcing long minimum 
connecting times and avoiding offering connections between low frequency flights," Khoo said. 
The analyst said launching a new airline connection initiative would offer some incremental revenue benefits for 
easyJet, but the opportunity is modest in the short term. 
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Cautious On easyJet's New Connections Initiative
"We see the incremental costs associated with the move to offer selected connecting flights as limited. In the case 
of Gatwick, the airport already offers a service that facilitates such connections (for a fee), so these costs are not 
borne by easyJet," Khoo said. 
The analyst sees upside coming from easyJet's expanded addressable customer base, which now includes 
connecting passengers on a handful of airlines. He pointed out that easyJet's load factors are so high, upside 
should come via higher unit revenues. 
The analyst also said easyJet appears to have beaten its rival Ryanair to the punch, with the Irish airline working on 
a similar concept - albeit at a slower pace, which is a positive.
Khoo argued that technology issues, compensation liability and airport co-operation are the key obstacles for 
Ryanair.
"We remain concerned about the demand/supply balance for the winter and beyond, with initial indications 
suggesting capacity growth could accelerate again. In turn, this implies easyJet's margins and free cash flow could 
remain under pressure," Khoo noted.

Mass Protests In France Against Macron Labour Law But Impact Limited

PARIS (Alliance News) - French President Emmanuel Macron's approach to his flagship labour law reforms 
appeared to be paying off for the moment as a one-day strike called by the hardline CGT union had limited impact 
on Tuesday.
According to the Interior Ministry, at least 223,000 protesters nevertheless took to the streets to decry what CGT 
head Philippe Martinez described as "a law to give full power to employers."
The CGT said 500,000 people had joined some 200 protests countrywide against measures that Macron, for his 
part, argues are needed to give employers the confidence to create new jobs.
Police in Paris said they fired tear gas at some 300 masked protesters who had thrown projectiles at them. The 
Interior Ministry said 13 arrests were made across the country.
The Eiffel Tower closed its lifts and top story due to strikes, allowing only access by stairs to the first floor, while 
Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC complained that it had had to cancel 110 flights.
Suburban trains in Paris were also disrupted, but most other transport services operated normally, with the other 
two main union groups largely shunning the CGT's call for a one-day strike.
The leader of France's largest union group, Laurent Berger of the CFDT, told France 2 television that the decrees 
unveiled by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on August 31 were "not a good reform".
But, he argued, the union that engaged with the consultation process led by Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud had 
"succeeded in ensuring that a number of even worse steps were not taken".
The reforms to France's complex and highly protective labour code were a key campaign commitment by Macron, 
who took office in May.
Mass Protests In France Against Macron Labour Law But Impact Limited
He said that businesses needed more flexibility in order to create jobs and reduce an unemployment rate that has 
drifted between 9 and 10.5% since 2010.
The draft decrees announced by Philippe, and due to be formally adopted by the government on September 
22, allow a greater range of working conditions to be agreed at company level rather than sector-wide.
They also allow the smallest companies to negotiate directly with staff or their chosen representatives, rather than 
with unions.
"It's not a labour law, but a law which gives full power to employers," Martinez charged in an interview with 
newspaper Le Parisien on Sunday.
Despite the limited response to the strike call, leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said he was confident Macron 
could be "made to pull back."
"Mr Macron knows that this is a trial of strength and he looked for it. Now it's up to us to rise to the challenge," 
Melenchon said as he joined protests in Marseille.
Melenchon's hard-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), despite holding only 17 seats in the 577-strong 
National Assembly, has managed to win the limelight as Macron's most determined opponent.
It has called its own day of protest for September 23, while the CGT is planning to take to the streets again on 
September 21.
As the Paris march dispersed at the city's southern Place d'Italie, one GCT official argued that they had not 
expected that one day of protest would be enough, but it was a good start.
"There aren't just activists here," Veronique Pascalides of the union's public finance branch told dpa. "It's a very 
good day for the start back after the summer holidays."
The protests were taking place as Macron travelled to the French Caribbean to visit the islands of Saint Martin and 
Saint Barthelemy, devastated last week by Hurricane Irma.
A day ahead of the protests, the president doubled down on controversial comments on Friday describing 
opponents of the reform as "idlers."
The phrase referred to "all those who think that we can do nothing, that we have that luxury," he told reporters.

Ryanair Cuts Baggage Fees To Encourage More Customers To Check In Bags

Bags

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it will lower the fees it 
charges and raise the size allowance for checked baggage, in order to eliminate boarding delays and encourage 
more passengers to check in luggage.
Ryanair said it has made this move as too many customers are making use of its current two free carry-on bag 
policy, for which it said there is not enough overhead cabin space, leading to boarding and flight delays.
As a result, from November 1, non-priority customers will only be allowed to board Ryanair's flights with one piece 
of smaller hand luggage, with the second, bigger bag to be placed in the hold free of charge at the boarding gate.
Priority boarding customers, however, will continue to be allowed to bring two carry-on bags, and non-priority 
passengers can upgrade to priority boarding for GBP5 at the time of booking or for GBP6 up to one hour prior to the 
scheduled flight departure.
To encourage more customers to check in their luggage, the low-cost airline will increase the check-in bag 
allowance to 20 kilogrammes from 15 kilogrammes and will cut the standard check-in bag fee to GBP25 from 
GBP35.
Ryanair said the bag policy changes will cost the company over EUR50 million per year in reduced checked bag 
fees, but that it believes offering bigger bags at lower fees will encourage more customers to consider checking in 
their luggage.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Barratt Developments said it completed more houses, generated higher revenue, and delivered a better margin in 
the recently ended financial year, leading to a 12% jump in pretax profit and a big hike to its dividend payout. The 
UK housebuilder raised its final dividend for the year to the end of July to 39% to 17.1 pence from only 12.3 pence 
the year before, and said it also will pay a special dividend of 17.3 pence on top. The special dividend totals 
GBP175.0 million. The final and special dividends, when added to the interim, means the total payout for the year is 
41.7 pence, 36% higher than the total 30.7p payout last year. Total completions rose 0.4% year-on-year to help 
push revenue 9.8% higher to GBP4.65 billion from GBP4.23 billion. Barratt remained the largest housebuilder in the 
UK, delivering 17,395 homes in the year, which its said reflected the strength of its housebuilding operations.
----------
Budget airline easyJet reported growth in both the number of passengers carried and in load factor year-on-year in 
August. easyJet carried 8.2 million passengers in August, up from 7.5 million in August 2016, while load factor rose 
to 96.3% from 94.9%. On Tuesday, rival low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings also had said it grew both the number of 
passengers carried and load factor in August year-on-year.
----------
Royal Dutch Shell opened its first gas station in Mexico on Tuesday, adding to a growing list of foreign-branded 
pumps in a market still dominated by the green-coloured outlets of state-owned company Pemex, Reuters reported. 
Following a 2013 constitutional energy overhaul that ended Pemex' decades-long monopoly, private companies can 
now brand gas stations and sell non-Pemex brand gasoline and diesel, as well as import fuels. Shell plans to open 
an unspecified number of additional service stations and that investment in Mexico's fuel sector could reach about 
USD1 billion over the next decade "if current market conditions are maintained", Reuters said.

The North Sea still has the support of supermajors BP and Royal Dutch Shell, but the basin will need to earn its 
right to grow within a rapidly changing energy landscape, oil bosses have warned, the Telegraph reported on 
Tuesday. Oil industry heavyweights have converged on Aberdeen this week for a conference focused on the future 
of the North Sea, as oil majors shift their portfolios towards low-cost oil, petroleum products, gas and even 
renewables.
----------
The Communications Workers Union is to ballot over 100,000 members who work for Royal Mail over whether to 
take industrial action, Sky News reported. Several disagreements, including on pension reform and the general 
direction the company has taken since privatisation in 2013, Sky News said. The ballot comes 10 days before Royal 
Mail is due to be removed from the FTSE 100 index due to the fall in its market value, which some analysts believe 
can be partly-blamed on the risk of industrial action.
----------
Micro Focus International released third quarter results for Hewlett Packard Enterprise's software arm that it 
purchased earlier this week, showing the unit experienced a decline in revenue but better margins. Micro Focus had 
struck its deal for the reverse takeover of the software arm of Hewlett Packard Enterprise in early September last 
year and formally closed the deal this week. HPE's software arm reported quarterly revenue of USD718 million, 
down 3% from the previous year and falling by 2% when adjusted for divestments and currency changes. Licence 
revenue was up 2% year-on-year, software-as-a-service revenue was 7% higher, but professional services revenue 
plummeted 23%. Support revenue was also down 2% year-on-year. For its own part, Hewlett Packard Enterprise 
said its third-quarter profit totalled USD497 million, or USD0.30 per share. This was down from USD840 million, or 
USD0.49 per share, in last year's third quarter. HPE said revenue for the quarter rose 2.5% to USD8.21 billion from 
USD8.01 billion last year.
----------
Sophos Group said the strong growth in billings seen in the first quarter of the financial year has accelerated into 
the second, prompting the security software and hardware company to raise its annual guidance. Sophos said it 
now expects annual billings growth to be around 20%, compared to previous guidance that said billings would see 
"mid to high-teens growth". In July, when it released its first-quarter results, Sophos said it also would improve its 
cash earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin by 50 to 100 basis points, while 
maintaining the level of free cashflow generation from the last financial year. Neither of these targets were 
mentioned on Wednesday in the company's brief statement.
----------
McCarthy & Stone released its trading update for the year ending August 31, showing revenue increased 4% from 
the same period last year. Revenue rose to GBP660 million from 2016's figure of GBP635.9 million, which it said 
was largely driven by a rise in the gross average selling price per unit. The selling price rose by 3% to GBP273,000 
from last year's figure of GBP264,000 in line with previous guidance. McCarthy & Stone said it recorded a 
consistent improvement in trading despite uncertainties provided by the UK's EU referendum result and the UK 
general election. Total legal completions rose slightly to 2,302 from 2016's 2,296.
----------
Acacia Mining said it has now purchased put options over 210,000 ounces of gold for USD3.2 million, as it takes 
further action to mitigate the severe amount of cash flowing out of the business as a result of a ban on concentrate 
exports out of Tanzania. Acacia, which said earlier this week that it was to reduce operations and spending at one 
of its three producing mines in Tanzania, said it has now purchased the put options to guarantee a strike price for 
its expected dore production over the next six months at USD1,300 per ounce, above its budgeted price of 
USD1,200. If the gold price rises above USD1,300, then Acacia will still see the benefit, but will be protected should 
prices fall below that threshold. The options will expire in equal instalments of 35,000 ounces per month over the 
period.
----------
Vectura Group said its loss in the first half of 2017 swelled significantly on higher research and development costs, 
higher levels of amortisation, and tighter margins. The company said revenue in the six months to the end of June 
rose to GBP78.8 million from GBP73.9 million the year before, but margins tightened to see gross profit fall to 
GBP50.4 million from GBP52.3 million. Operating profit still dipped, even before exceptional items and amortisation 
was taken into account, falling to GBP15.1 million from GBP18.5 million.

Sports Direct International said trading in its new generation flagship stores continues to exceed its expectations, 
and said its outlook remains "optimistic". The sports clothing and equipment retailer - which has a vision to become 
the "Selfridges of sport" - said it continues to "elevate" its store portfolio in the UK and elsewhere by relocating 
smaller format stores to the new generation stores, in order to "elevate our retail space and improve the experience 
for both our customers and our third-party brand partners". Sports Direct reiterated its aim to achieve growth in 
underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of between 5% and 15% in its current 
financial 2018 year.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Proposals to force a post-Brexit cut in low-skilled migrants to the UK from the continent have ignited a political row 
on the eve of an explosive Commons battle over European Union withdrawal. A leaked UK Home Office document 
outlining ways to restrict immigration heightened the political temperature over Brexit after Labour insisted it would 
vote against the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which gets its second reading in Parliament on Thursday, and pro-Europe 
Tory MPs threatened to back amendments to the landmark legislation. The 82-page government paper, obtained by 
The Guardian, suggests that new immigration arrangements would be introduced immediately at the point the UK 
finally leaves the EU at the end of a transition period lasting at least two years.
----------
Holidaymakers in the Caribbean and Florida have been urged to comply with any evacuation orders as the most 
powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricane on record approaches. The category five hurricane is expected to slam into the 
Leeward Islands of Antigua and Barbuda on Wednesday, before following a path along the Greater Antilles toward 
the US. Six islands in the Bahamas are being evacuated on Wednesday, while officials in the Leeward Islands have 
reportedly cut power and urged residents to seek shelter in a statement that ended with "May God protect us all." 
As the hurricane approached, Richard Branson refused to leave his private Necker Island in the British Virgin 
Islands, but admitted "almost nothing" can withstand a storm of Irma's force.
----------
Ireland's consumer sentiment weakened in August as consumers reined in their spending plans and continued to 
report only limited gains in their personal finances, survey data from KBC Bank and Economic and Social Research 
Institute showed. The KBC Bank/ESRI consumer sentiment index fell to 102.9 in August from the 17-month high of 
105.1 registered in July. The survey suggested that sentiment was broadly positive but Irish consumers were still 
cautious because household spending power remain constrained.

German factory orders declined unexpectedly in July on weak domestic demand, figures from Destatis revealed. 
Factory orders fell 0.7% month-on-month in July, in contrast to a revised 0.9% rise in June. This was the first fall in 
three months. Orders were forecast to climb 0.2% in July.
----------
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed to seek a stronger UN 
sanctions resolution against North Korea in the wake of its nuclear test over the weekend, Japan's Foreign Ministry 
has said. Pyongyang's sixth nuclear test on Sunday poses a threat "not only to Japan but also to the whole world," 
Merkel told Abe during their 20-minute phone conversation, according to the ministry. The German leader 
reportedly also told Abe that she will call on other EU leaders to work together on the issue. Meanwhile, North 
Korea has said fresh sanctions against the country will be met by a "counteroffensive" causing "catastrophic 
consequences".
----------
US President Donald Trump said late Tuesday he would revisit the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals 
programme affecting hundreds of thousands of young immigrants if Congress fails to "legalize" it, after his 
administration said it would end the policy. "Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama 
Administration was unable to do)," Trump tweeted Tuesday night. "If they can't, I will revisit this issue!" The 
comment appeared in contrast to statements made earlier in the day, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions saying 
the administration would end the programme that has allowed young immigrants brought to the US illegally as 
children to remain in the country.

Aveva Group confirmed it has agreed to a GBP3.00 billion-plus merger with the software arm of France's Schneider 
Electric. Aveva said Schneider Electric is to take a 60% stake in the enlarged Aveva, which will remain listed in 
London and headquartered in Cambridge, with the merger classified as a reverse takeover. The deal, which values 
Aveva at GBP1.7 billion, will create one of the UK's biggest listed software companies, consummating a courtship 
that began in 2015. Aveva said the GBP550 million in cash being paid by Schneider - about 858 pence per Aveva

Anglo American said its De Beers diamond unit's seventh sales cycle of the ten to be held this year generated a 
total sales value of USD505 million, falling from the prior sale. Anglo American owns 85% of De Beers, one of its

USD576 million in the sixth sales cycle announced at the start of August, which in turn had risen from USD541 
million in the fifth sales cycle of the year. The latest sale was considerably lower than the same sale in 2016, which 
was valued at USD639 million.

DS Smith said it has made an "encouraging" start to its financial year, with trading in line with its expectations. The 
FTSE 250 recycled packaging supplier said it has seen "strong demand" for its enhanced packaging products 
across the business in the period since May 1, with the rate of like-for-like volume growth well ahead of the 
comparative period the year before. Progress with its pan-European and e-commerce customers has been 
particularly strong, DS Smith said, adding that the recovery of recent increases in paper prices is progressing as 
expected. The firm said the benefit of the short-term recovery on paper prices is being mitigated by operational 
leverage coming from strong top-line growth.

The UK service sector growth slipped to a 11-month low in August, survey data from IHS Markit and Chartered 
Institute of Procurement & Supply showed. The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-expected to 
53.2 in August from 53.8 in July. The expected reading was 53.5. Nonetheless, a score above 50 still indicates 
expansion. The reading signalled the slowest pace of growth since September 2016. The rates of growth eased 
since July and remained notably weaker than seen on average in the first half of 2017, Markit said. Survey 
respondents said subdued client demand and heightened uncertainty about the domestic economic outlook had 
weighed on business activity growth in August.

Like-for-like sales in the UK climbed 1.3% on year in August, the British Retail Consortium said - accelerating from 
the 0.9% increase in July. Food sales remained firm, advancing an annual 3.2% - slowing from 3.4% in the previous 
month. Online non-food sales surged 11% on year, up from 8.8% a month earlier. "Non-food sales have only just 
recovered to levels seen two years ago, after a dismal August in 2016, while strong figures for food are largely the 
result of rising prices, leaving growth in volume terms weaker than last year," said BRC Chief Executive Helen 
Dickinson.
----------
The UK government wants to "intensify" Brexit negotiations and move faster than the current rate of negotiations in 
Brussels, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May said. "We are ready to intensify negotiations," the 
spokeswoman said. "Nothing has been formally agreed but that is something that we can discuss. Typically, (with) 
negotiations, as time goes on you see the pace pick up." Online political journal Politico reported that the British 
government proposed to increase the next rounds of talks to negotiate Britain's departure from the European Union 
from one week a month, the current rate, to "week-by-week". Last week, the third round of Brexit talks ended in a 
stalemate with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier saying the two sides "did not make any decisive progress," 
after four days of meetings.
----------
David Davis faces a grilling from UK MPs on Brexit following a summer of negotiations which the European Union 
claims has failed to deliver "decisive" progress on key issues. The Brexit Secretary is expected to make a House of 
Commons statement on withdrawal talks on Tuesday as MPs return from the summer parliamentary recess, with 
the government facing Brexit battles on multiple fronts.
----------
Ireland's service sector continued to expand strongly in August, survey data from IHS Markit showed. The 
seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector rose to 58.4 in August from 58.3 in July. 
Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
----------
The Eurozone private sector logged steady growth in August, final data from IHS Markit showed. The composite 
output index came in at 55.7 in August, matching July's reading but down slightly from the flash estimate of 55.8. 
The services Purchasing Managers' Index slid to 54.7 from 55.4 in July. The flash score was 54.9.
----------
Eurozone retail sales declined in July due to a fall in food sales, data from Eurostat showed. Retail sales volume 
decreased 0.3% month-on-month in July, partially offsetting June's 0.6% increase. The pace of decline matched 
economists' expectations. Sales of 'food, drinks, tobacco,' decreased 0.5%, while non-food product sales rose 
0.1%. Year-on-year, retail sales growth eased to 2.6% in July, in line with forecast, from 3.3% in June.
----------
China's private sector expanded at the strongest pace in six months in August underpinned by increased activity at 
both manufacturers and services providers. The Caixin composite output index rose to 52.4 in August from 51.9 in 
July, survey data from IHS Markit showed. A score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. Services companies 
registered the fastest upturn in business activity for three months in August. The Purchasing Mangers' Index came 
in at 52.7, up from 51.5 in July.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is "begging for war," US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said, warning that 
the US' tolerance for provocations was wearing thin. Haley also announced the US would propose a new sanctions 
package against Pyongyang with a vote planned for next Monday, as the 15-member UN Security Council held an 
emergency meeting a day after North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test. "War is never something the US wants

- we don't want it now, but our country's patience is not unlimited," Haley said. Kim wants to be acknowledged as a

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia this week to discuss the 
North Korean nuclear crisis, Tokyo said, while South Korea has conducted live-fire drills off the Korean Peninsula. 
Abe and Putin will hold talks on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in the Russian port 
city of Vladivostok, Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. North Korean 
officials are also expected to participate in the two-day conference, which will be held in the wake of Pyongyang's 
sixth nuclear test on Sunday, its most powerful to date. Meanwhile, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported 
the drills in the East Sea were "massive," adding that the navy said the manoeuvres were a show of the country's 
"resolve to retaliate against North Korea's provocations".
----------
Leaders of BRICS countries were set to meet those from other developing countries on Tuesday, as the summit in 
the Chinese coastal city of Xiamen begins its final day. Talks will include the leaders of Egypt, Guinea, Mexico, 
Tajikistan and Thailand, who were invited under the forum's "BRICS Plus" process, which looks to include other 
developing economies in dialogue. The BRICS association consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. 
China has been pushing the idea of the BRICS group as a cohesive block and President Xi Jinping in his keynote 
speech on Sunday called for the countries to push back against rising global protectionism and come up with 
concrete ways to deal with problems arising from globalization.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday launched its London summer 
2018 schedule.
Ryanair launched 168 routes in total, including five new London Stansted routes to Aalborg in Denmark, Dusseldorf 
and Frankfurt in Germany, Oradea in Romania, and Pardubice in the Czech Republic, and a new London Luton 
route to Bydgoszcz in Poland.
It said this will deliver 24.8 million customers through London's Stansted, Gatwick and Luton airports this year.
The low-cost carrier noted that given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, it needs "clarity" before it will be able to 
publish its summer 2019 schedule this time next year, reiterating that it may be "forced" to cancel flights and move 
some or all of its UK-based aircraft to Continental Europe from April 2019 onwards, "should the legal basis for the 
operation of flights between the UK and the EU by autumn 2018 remain undefined".
"We remain concerned at the uncertainty which surrounds the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in March 
2019. While we continue to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU Open Skies agreement, we caution that 
should the UK leave, there may not be sufficient time, or goodwill on both sides, to negotiate a timely replacement 
bilateral which could result in a disruption of flights between the UK and Europe for a period of time from April 2019 
onwards, and/or the cancellation of flights and routes, and the movement of our based aircraft to Continental 
Europe," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 1.1% to EUR17.73 on Thursday.

Ryanair Calls For Block To Lufthansa-Air Berlin Takeover "Stitch-Up"
Ryanair Calls For Block To Lufthansa-Air Berlin Takeover "Stitch-Up"

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has urged the German 
Bundeskartellamt and the European Commission to block German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG from potentially 
taking over Air Berlin PLC.
Earlier this month, Air Berlin, which is Germany's second largest airline after Lufthansa, filed for insolvency 
proceedings after main shareholder Etihad Airways PJSC withdrew its financial support. Etihad is the second 
largest airline in the UAE.
Soon after, Air Berlin revealed it was in discussions with three potential buyers, including Lufthansa, as it looks to 
sell off its assets.
At that time, Ryanair responded by filing competition complaints with Germany's competition regulator 
Bundeskartellamt and the European Commission, accusing Air Berlin of "manufacturing" its insolvency.
Ryanair said the German carrier's insolvency had been "set up" to allow Lufthansa to take over a "debt-free" Air 
Berlin, which would be in breach of German and EU competition rules.
The Irish airline reiterated its view on Wednesday, saying it has "urged" the regulators to block the "stitch-up 
between the German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin", which it defined as an "anti-consumer takeover".
"This insolvency is being timed to allow Lufthansa to take over a debt-free Air Berlin, which will be in breach of all 
German and EU competition rules, and this Lufthansa monopoly has been supported by the German government 
providing EUR150 million of state aid, so that Lufthansa can acquire Air Berlin, as Lufthansa moves from a 68% 
share to a 95% monopoly, which will result in German customers and visitors suffering higher air fares," Ryanair 
said.
According to Ryanair, if Lufthansa does buy Air Berlin competitor airlines will "struggle" to get slots in major airports 
such as Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich, as Lufthansa will control over 80% of peak time slots.
Ryanair Calls For Block To Lufthansa-Air Berlin Takeover "Stitch-Up"
Ryanair added that is has also urged Berliners to vote to keep open the city's Tegel airport, which is facing closure 
to make way for the new Brandenburg airport. A vote on Tegel airport's closure will be held on September 24.
According to Ryanair, the new Brandenburg airport will have a capacity of 27 million passengers, which is less than 
the airport in Dublin - a city with one-third of Berlin's population.
"With almost 33 million passengers already travelling through Berlin's two existing Schonefeld and Tegel airports 
last year, the planned closure of Tegel will leave Berlin with less airport capacity than its existing traffic," Ryanair 
said.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 1.0% at EUR17.54 on Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it has launched its Dublin 
summer 2018 schedule.
The schedule includes five new routes, comprising a double daily service to Munich, a daily service to Stuttgart, and 
services to Marrakech, Naples and Paphos, as well as more flights to Hamburg.
Ryanair said the total of 90 routes will deliver 12.9 million customers through Dublin airport next year.
"We are delighted to see Ryanair add five new routes from Dublin airport, two for this winter and three for the 
forthcoming summer season. These new routes will offer additional choice and convenience for both business and 
leisure passengers. The combination of Ryanair's new routes and extensions to its existing services means that 
Ryanair will grow its overall Dublin airport summer traffic by 4% next year," said Kevin Toland, chief executive of 
Dublin airport operator DAA.
Ryanair added that it is calling on the Irish government to end "the repeated delays" to building a second runway at 
Dublin airport, which it said is "urgently" needed to "prevent Ireland's airport infrastructure falling further behind its 
international competitors".
"The development of the second runway at Dublin airport is a critical piece of national infrastructure which needs to 
be expedited, especially when Ireland is trying to attract overseas investment that may be leaving the UK in the run 
up to Brexit in March 2019, and given that runway capacity at Dublin is already full at peak times," Ryanair Chief 
Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.2% to EUR17.81 on Tuesday morning.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks were little changed in lackluster trade on 
Wednesday after ECB President Mario Draghi defended unconventional monetary policy, saying QE and forward 
guidance have been a success.
With geopolitical tensions running high and US President Donald Trump signaling the possible termination of the 
NAFTA treaty with Mexico and Canada, investors looked ahead to the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy 
Symposium in Wyoming for further direction.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was down about 0.2% at 375.12 in late opening deals after rising 0.8% 
the previous day.
The German DAX and the UK's FTSE were marginally lower, while France's CAC 40 was little changed with a

underpinned by strong expansion in the manufacturing output, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed.
The flash composite output index rose slightly to 55.8 in August from 55.7 in July. Economists had expected the 
index to fall to 55.4.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets ended Wednesday's session in 
negative territory. 
After snapping a 3-day losing streak on Tuesday, the markets got off to a positive start this morning. However, they 
quickly slid into the red and remained there for the remainder of the session.
Economic data from Europe was positive, with private sector activity maintaining its strong growth momentum in 
August. Traders were concerned by comments made by President Donald Trump at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on 
Tuesday. Trump pledged to a crowd of supporters that he would build the controversial wall on the border with 
Mexico even if it meant shutting down the government.
Trump also indicated he's likely to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, raising concerns about the 
impact on global trade.
Monetary and regulatory policy actions and steps in supervision undertaken over the last decade have made the 
world more resilient, however, central banks must continue preparing for new challenges, European Central Bank 
President Mario Draghi said Wednesday.
"When the world changes as it did ten years ago, policies, especially monetary policy, need to be adjusted," Draghi 
said in a speech delivered to a gathering of Nobel laureates and economists in Lindau, Germany.
"Such an adjustment, never easy, requires unprejudiced, honest assessment of the new realities with clear eyes, 
unencumbered by the defense of previously held paradigms that have lost any explanatory power."
Draghi is due to speak at the upcoming economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming later this week. 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is also slated to speak at the event on Friday.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.50%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 0.49%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.47%.

Germany's private sector activity expanded at a faster pace in August, as output growth strengthened in both the 
manufacturing and service sectors, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday. The composite output 
index climbed to a 2-month high of 55.7 in August from 54.7 in July.
French private sector activity expanded at a marked pace in August, though the rate of growth stagnated, flash 
survey data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday. The composite output index came in at 55.6 in August, the same 
reading as in July.
New home sales in the US unexpectedly saw a substantial decrease in the month of July, according to a report 
released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. The report said new home sales plunged by 9.4% to an 
annual rate of 571,000 in July from the revised June rate of 630,000.
The steep drop surprised economists, who had expected new home sales to inch up to a rate of 612,000 from the 
610,000 originally reported for the previous month.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Transport has been one of the strongest-performing sectors in Europe in 2017 so far, 
according to Davy Research, which has Irish budget airline Ryanair as one of its preferred names.
Better pricing trends for the airlines and persistent volume strength across key logistics markets have driven the 
transport sector's strong performance in the year to date, Davy said, a trend which the broker predicts will continue 
through the second half.
According to Davy, the second-quarter results season was "unique" for European airlines, in that unit revenues at 
constant currency grew for every airline under the broker's coverage, which it said is a first for that time of year.
Davy thinks the airlines will see further broad-based pricing improvement in the second half, with intra-European 
capacity expected to grow by 6% in the period.
"Our airlines' ratings reflect a preference for those with positively-skewed earnings momentum through the rest of 
the year. We retain Outperform ratings on Lufthansa, Ryanair and Air France-KLM, while downgrading International 
Consolidated Airlines Group to Neutral," Davy said, noting that it believes "it is time to selectively take profits on 
recent share price strength".
Shares in IAG were trading down 0.8% to 611.50 pence on Tuesday, but are up 39% in the year to date. Ryanair 
shares were up 0.4% to EUR18.59 and are up 28% in the year to date.
Meanwhile, growth across all the main logistics markets the broker tracks was also strong in the second quarter, 
Davy said, with average daily volume in international express markets up 8.4% year-on-year, air volume up 10% 
and ocean volume up 4%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks ended lower on Friday, as further troubles with US President Donald Trump's 
administration and two terrorist attacks in Spain led to a major risk-off sentiment among investors. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 1.0%, or 72.46 points, at 7,315.41. The blue-chip index ended the week up 0.2%. 
The FTSE 250 ended down 0.8%, or 156.42 points, at 19,616.66, and up 0.5% for the week as a whole. The AIM 
All-Share closed down 0.3%, or 2.66 points, at 999.66, up 1.0% for the week. 
The BATS UK 100 ended down 0.9% at 12,453.19, the BATS 250 closed down 0.8% at 17,826.03, and the BATS 
Small Companies ended 0.3% lower at 12,158.79.
The number of people killed in two terrorist attacks in Spain rose to 14, after a woman died from injuries sustained 
in a car-ramming incident in Cambrils, emergency services said Friday. Thirteen people were killed in Barcelona 
when a van rammed into people in the pedestrian area of Las Ramblas, a tourist hotspot in the centre of town. More 
than 100 others were injured.
The Islamic State group said via its affiliated Amaq news agency that its "soldiers" were responsible for the attack.
Travel and tourism-related stocks were hit in the wake of the terrorist attack, and whilst they regained some ground 
throughout the day, still ended among the worst performers. 
International Consolidated Airlines Group closed as the worst performer, down 3.1%. IAG, which owns British 
Airways and Aer Lingus, has high exposure to Spain via Iberia and Vueling, a low-cost airline based in Barcelona. 
IAG also owns Level, a low-cost long-haul airline, also based in the Catalan capital.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Barcelona And Trump Worries See Stocks End Lower
Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings closed down 1.5%, whilst peer easyJet ended down 0.7%. Hotel operator 
InterContinental Hotels Group closed down 1.6%.
Across the pond, US House of Representatives Leader Nancy Pelosi led a call by Democratic lawmakers to remove 
Confederate statues on display in the halls of Congress. The Democrats rejected President Donald Trump's 
criticism of the removal of "beautiful" Confederate statues.
The heated nationwide debate over the removal of monuments to the Confederacy reached Capitol Hill Thursday 
when Pelosi called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to start the process for removing memorials for leaders of the 
Confederacy. The removal of a statue of Robert E Lee had led to deadly clashes between white nationalists and 
protesting crowds in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.
Trump had drawn fire for not speaking out forcefully enough against white supremacists in the wake of violence at 
the rally in Charlottesville that left one woman dead. 
Eight members of the President's American Manufacturing Council - including the chief executives of Dow 
Chemical, Intel, Merck, 3M, Johnson & Johnson and United Technologies - have resigned since Sunday over the 
issue, while all members of the Strategic & Policy Forum agreed to quit the group Wednesday. 
This has led to ongoing concerns among investors about Trump's ability to implement his pro-business agenda. 
Upon his inauguration as US president, Trump initially said he would ramp up infrastructure spending in the US. 
Among the blue-chip decliners in London were equipment rental company Ashtead, closing down 2.8%, and 
building materials group CRH, closing down 1.8%. Both companies have significant exposure to the US 
construction market. 
"Trump's decision to disband the advisory council on infrastructure has put a dent in their share prices. Both stocks 
were given a boost by the election of Trump as he pledged to ramp up spending on infrastructure, but now traders 
are getting out of their positions on the back of recent developments," said IG Group analyst David Madden.
At the other end of the large-cap index, Randgold Resources ended as the best performer, up 1.7%, as the sell-off 
in equities led to a rise in the gold price, with investors moving back to 'safe-haven' assets. Fellow gold miner 
Acacia Mining was the best mid-cap performer, closing up 6.5%.
The precious metal was quoted at USD1,289.67 an ounce against USD1,284.32 a the London equities close on 
Thursday. Gold hit an intraday high of USD1,300.70, a level it has not seen since November 2016.
"The decline in global equities has helped the demand for gold as it is deemed to be a safe haven asset. On risk-off 
days is it not surprising to see funds flow out of stocks and into gold. The dip in the US dollar today also helped the 
metal. It is interesting that gold took out the June high of USD1,296, because this could be the start of a leg higher. 
After all, traders are not worried about an interest rate hike from the Fed in the next few months," Madden said. 
In Paris the CAC 40 ended down 0.6%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended down 0.3%. 
On a light day in the global economic calendar, the pound was quoted at USD1.2846 at the London equities close 
Friday, compared to USD1.2884 at the same time on Thursday. The euro stood at USD1.1740 at the European 
equities close, against USD1.1741 the prior day.
Stocks in New York were mixed at the London equities close. The DJIA was down 0.2%, the S&P 500 index was 
flat and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.2%.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Barcelona And Trump Worries See Stocks End Lower
"Markets have extended their losses this afternoon in the UK and Europe, but in the US declines have slowed 
markedly, while this year's most crowded trade, the Nasdaq, is actually eking out some gains. The classic 
symptoms of August markets have been seen – lack of news, an abundance of rumour, and low volumes. Given 
that the previous three weeks had been some of the most quiet in the post-war history of the S&P 500, it is not 
surprising to see volatility that would, in 2016, have been considered run of the mill, being the occasion for 
heightened nervousness, if not outright panic," said IG analyst Chris Beauchamp.
Brent oil was a touch higher and was quoted at USD51.75 a barrel at the close on Friday, from USD50.67 at the 
same time the prior day. 
In the economic calendar on Monday, Rightmove house prices are released at midnight, while the UK public sector 
net borrowing data are at 0930 BST. In the US, the Chicago Federal Reserve national activity index is at 1330 BST. 
In a thin UK corporate calendar, there are interim results from TBC Bank Group, Headlam Group, and Global Ports 
Holding.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London were lower on Friday at midday, with travel stocks leading the fallers 
following two terrorist attacks in Barcelona on Thursday, while sentiment was also dampened by weak trading in 
New York as investors seem to be losing patience with US President Donald Trump.
The FTSE 100 index was down 0.9%, or 69.19 points at 7,318.68. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was down 0.9% at 
19,601.03, and the AIM All-Share index was down 0.4% at 998.54.
The BATS UK 100 index was down 1.0% at 12,439.68. The BATS 250 was down 0.9% at 17,800.02. The BATS 
Small Companies was down 0.3% at 12,153.23.
Spanish police have arrested a third person in connection with the Barcelona terrorist attack that killed at least 13 
people and injured more than 100 others on Thursday. The attacker struck a bustling commercial area of Barcelona 
popular with local and tourists, killing and injuring people of at least 20 nationalities, Catalonia authorities said.
It was unclear if the person arrested was the driver of the van who fled after ploughing into the busy Las Ramblas 
thoroughfare on Thursday evening. The man was taken into custody in the town of Ripoll, about 100 kilometres 
north of Barcelona, police said Friday.
Two people linked to the attack were arrested shortly after the vehicle rampage took place. Catalan police said one 
was a Moroccan and the other a Spanish national from the North African Spanish enclave of Melilla. Neither were 
known to have any previous links to terrorism.
The Islamic State group said via its affiliated Amaq news agency that its "soldiers" were responsible for the attack.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Barcelona Terror Attack, Trump Hit Risk Appetite
Hours after the first incident, police said they killed five alleged terrorists who tried to mow down pedestrians in the 
Catalan resort town of Cambrils, about 100 kilometres south-west of Barcelona.
Local media said the attackers drove off after police tried to carry out a check, aiming at pedestrians as they went. 
The police gave chase, the vehicle then overturned and the men were shot dead as they tried to flee. The suspects 
were wearing fake explosives belts, Catalan police said on Twitter.
Tourism and travel-related stocks were heavily hit on Friday as investors digested the news from Spain. 
International Consolidated Airlines Group was down 2.0%, while easyJet was 1.4% lower. 
IAG - the owner of British Airways and Irish airline Aer Lingus - also owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, a 
low-cost airline based in Barcelona. IAG also owns Level, a low-cost long-haul airline, also based in the Spanish 
city.
FTSE 250-listed air carrier Wizz Air Holdings was down 2.3%, while Ryanair Holdings was down 1.6%
"Unsurprisingly we are seeing the airlines leading the FTSE 100 lower this morning. In London, Paris and now 
Barcelona, the terrorist attacks over recent years have taken place in the three most visited cities in Europe, with 
inevitable implications for numbers over the coming year. With Turkish tourism numbers finally coming back, the 
focus on top European cities will arguably be a bigger hit to low cost European carriers if people decide to stay 
away," said IG analyst Joshua Mahony. 
InterContinental Hotels Group was down 1.4%. FTSE 250-listed transport firm National Express Group was down 
2.1%, while fellow mid-cap travel operator Thomas Cook was down 1.5%. 
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 1.1% and 0.6%, 
respectively. 
Stocks in the US were pointed for a marginally higher open on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 
the S&P 500 index seen flat, and the Nasdaq Composite pointed 0.1% higher.
The three major New York stock indices suffered heavy declines on Thursday, with the DJIA ending down 1.2%, the 
S&P down 1.5% and the Nasdaq down 1.9%.
"The optimism of this week appears to have faded, with the prospect of an even tougher environment for Donald 
Trump bringing into doubt the likeliness of any tangible policies in the near future," noted IG's Mahony. 
"While the week started well, we are now seeing widespread selling for global stocks, with traders instead choosing 
to shift their focus towards the likes of gold and the yen. News that Trump has disbanded an industrial committee 
before it had even been full formed says it all, with businesses turning their back on the President en masse," the 
analyst said.
Trump has decided not to assemble an infrastructure advisory council as planned, US news reports said. The goal 
of the Advisory Council on Infrastructure was to advise Trump on his plan to propose spending billions of dollars 
upgrading roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. 
Shares in Ashtead Group were down 1.9%. The equipment rental firm is greatly exposed to the US via its Sunbelt 
Rentals business. 
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Barcelona Terror Attack, Trump Hit Risk Appetite
The news came one day after Trump announced he was disbanding two other business advisory councils as 
several corporate chief executives resigned from them in protest over Trump's remarks on violence that broke out 
Saturday at a demonstration by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Gold was quoted at USD1,295.19 an ounce at midday, higher than USD1,284.32 an ounce at the London equities 
close on Thursday. FTSE 100-listed Randgold Resources was the biggest blue-chip gainer, up 1.1%.
RSA Insurance was another gainer in the FTSE 100, up 1.2%, after RBC Capital upgraded the firm to Outperform 
from Sector Perform.
Still in the economic calendar on Friday, in the US, the Michigan consumer sentiment index is at 1500 BST, while 
the Baker Hughes oil rig count is at 1800 BST.
Released earlier in the day, Data from Destatis showed German producer prices for industrial products advanced 
2.3% year-on-year in July, slightly weaker than the 2.4% increase seen in June. This was the weakest since 
December, when prices gained 1%. Economists had forecast 2.2% annual increase.
Month-on-month, producer prices gained 0.2% after staying flat in June. Prices were forecast to remain unchanged 
in July.
The euro area current account surplus declined to the lowest in nearly three years in June, the European Central 
Bank said. The current account surplus fell to EUR21.2 billion in June from EUR30.5 billion in May. This was the 
lowest level since August 2014.
The surplus on trade in goods rose to EUR27.4 billion in June from EUR 26.6 billion. Meanwhile, the surplus on 
services declined to EUR2.2 billion from EUR2.7 billion.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Friday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Randgold Resources, up 1.1%. The gold miner was tracking spot gold prices higher, quoted at USD1,293.60 an 
ounce compared to USD1,284.32 at the London equities close Thursday. Midcap peer Hochschild Mining was also 
up 2.1%. "Gold has been pushed higher overnight thanks to increased safe-haven demand after the Barcelona 
attack," said Henry Croft, analyst at Accendo Markets.
RSA Insurance Group, up 0.3%. RBC Capital upgraded the insurer to Outperform from Sector Perform. 
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
International Consolidated Airlines, down 2.5%, easyJet, down 2.2%, InterContinental Hotels, down 2.1%, Carnival, 
down 1.8%. The travel and leisure stocks were lower in wake of the terrorist attack in Barcelona late Thursday. A 
van crashed into a crowd of people in Las Ramblas, on one of Barcelona's busiest thoroughfares, with local media 
reporting at least 13 people had been killed in what police said was a terrorist attack. IAG owns Spanish carriers 
Iberia and Vueling, a low-cost airline based in Barcelona. IAG also owns Level, a low-cost long-haul airline, also

----------
WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: Attack Hits Travel Stocks But Benefits Gold
SIG, down 1.8%. Numis downgraded the building products distributor to Reduce from Hold. "We acknowledge that 
management actions to date on the balance sheet and scope for cost savings etc provide SIG with a good recovery 
profile. However, we believe that the valuation is now up with events relative to our (unchanged) target price and we 
move to Reduce recommendation," said Numis analyst Howard Seymour.
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Vast Resources, up 11%. The miner said Sub-Sahara Goldia Investments has exercised its right to provide up to 
USD10 million of financing to the London-listed company, matching the finance to be provided by an unnamed 
corporate finance firm. The funds raised will be used to expand the Vast's operations in Romania and to fund the 
possible demerger of the Zimbabwe assets from the company. Vast currently operates the Manaila polymetallic 
mine, which was commissioned in 2015, and holds interest in the Baita Plai polymetallic mine, both in Romania.
Shanta Gold, up 7.5%. The gold miner said its interim loss narrowed while revenue declined and revealed that it will 
no longer buy Helio Resource Corp due to the legislative changes in Tanzania. Shanta said since July, gold 
shipments have attracted higher royalty rates of 6%, up from 4% previously, and a clearing fee of 1% has been 
applied. Shanta, which has defined ore resources on the New Luika and Singida projects and holds exploration 
licences all in Tanzania, maintained that its full-year gold production forecast remains unchanged at between 80,00 
to 85,000 ounces, "albeit towards the lower end" of guidance due to the exclusion of the Singida pilot plant 
production. Shanta also said it has terminated its deal to buy Canada-based Helio, which owns the SMP gold 
project in Tanzania in the Lupa gold field adjacent to Shanta's New Luika mine, due to the potential impact of the 
legislative changes in Tanzania on Helio. 
Kingspan Group, up 5.7%. The Irish insulation and building services company said a rise in revenue more than 
offset tighter margins in the first half of 2017, leading to higher profit for the period and a decision to lift the dividend 
by 10%. The company said revenue increased 19% year-on-year in the first six months of 2017 to EUR1.75 billion 
from EUR1.47 billion the year before, with a higher gross profit of EUR505.80 million from EUR457.4 million. Pretax 
profit for the interim period increased to EUR163.3 million from EUR154.8 million. Kingspan said the interim 
dividend has been lifted by 10% to 11.0 cents from the 10.0 cent payout the year before. 
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
System1 Group, down 27%. The marketing agency warned it expects to report a fall in profit in its current financial 
year following a "slower-than-expected start". System1 warned at the time of its results for its last financial year in 
June that it was experiencing a slower-than-expected start to the new year, and on Friday said this has continued. 
As a result, the company now expects gross profit in the first half to the end of September to be between 6% and 
11% lower year-on-year, mainly due to the non-recurrence of "large one-off innovation projects" resulting from 
some "significant" client spending deferrals and "a more competitive market", although it noted that "there have 
been some more encouraging signs recently".

Ryanair Files Complaints Over Air Berlin 's "Manufactured" Insolvency
Ryanair Files Complaints Over Air Berlin's "Manufactured" Insolvency

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC late Tuesday said it has lodged competition 
complaints with the German Bundeskartellamt and the European Commission to "block" German airline Deutsche 
Lufthansa AG from potentially taking over Air Berlin PLC.
Air Berlin, which is Germany's second largest airline after Lufthansa, said earlier Tuesday it has filed for insolvency 
proceedings after main shareholder Etihad Airways PJSC withdrew its financial support. Etihad is the second 
largest airline in the UAE.
Air Berlin also noted it is in ongoing negotiations with Lufthansa and other parties regarding the disposal of its 
business units.
Late Tuesday, Ryanair released a statement in response to Air Berlin's news, saying it has filed competition 
complaints with Germany's competition regulator Bundeskartellamt and the European Commission, regarding the 
"obvious conspiracy playing out in Germany between the German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin to carve up 
Air Berlin's assets, while excluding major competitors and ignoring both EU competition and state aid rules".
Ryanair accused Air Berlin of "manufacturing" its insolvency, which it said has been "set up" to allow Lufthansa to 
take over a "debt-free" Air Berlin, which Ryanair said will be in breach of "all known" German and EU competition 
rules.
"Now even the German government is supporting this Lufthansa-led monopoly with EUR150 million of state aid so 
that Lufthansa can acquire Air Berlin and drive domestic air fares in Germany even higher than they already are. 
German customers and visitors will suffer higher air fares to pay for this Lufthansa monopoly," Ryanair warned.
"Given the fact that the German government is centrally involved in these manoeuvres, the Bundeskartellamt is 
likely to struggle to get out of bed. On this basis, and bearing in mind the scale of the market shares and the 
European implications involved, it is all the more important that the European Commission takes immediate and 
decisive action," the Irish airline added.
Ryanair Files Complaints Over Air Berlin 's "Manufactured" Insolvency
Shares in Ryanair closed up 3.1% at EUR19.08 on Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The private investment firm which owns British low-cost carrier Monarch Airlines is 
considering a bid for Italy's Alitalia, according to Sky News. 
Sky reported Monday evening that Greybull Capital is keen on Alitalia's engineering business, and would consider 
seeking partners to help operate the airline's short-haul business. Greybull also owns British Steel, acquired from 
Tata Steel Europe in 2016.  
However, Greybull is reportedly less enthusiastic over taking on Alitalia's ground handling operations, which may 
put it at a disadvantage in the auction process, after the Italian government put the airline up for sale earlier this 
year. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC is also involved in the Alitalia bidding process, with easyJet PLC also having expressed 
interest.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Monday it is urging tighter restrictions on the sale of alcohol 
in UK airports. 
Ryanair noted that the UK's Civil Aviation Authority reported a sevenfold increase in disruptive passenger incidents 
in the UK between 2012 and 2016, with most involving alchohol. 
Meanwhile, the BBC reported Monday that arrests of passengers suspected of being drunk rose 50% in the year to 
February 2017, to 387 from 255 the prior year. The Unite trade union has said a survey of its members found a 
code of conduct designed to curb drunkenness on planes has had little effect. 
Ryanair said it is calling for a ban on sale of alcohol in airport bars and restaurants before 10am, mandatory use of 
boarding cards when buying alcoholic drinks in bars and restaurants, and a maximum of two drinks permitted per 
boarding pass. 
"It's completely unfair that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines 
to deal with the safety consequences," said Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer at Ryanair. 
"This is a particular problem during flight delays when airports apply no limit to the sale of alcohol in airside bars 
and restaurants. This is an issue which the airports must now address and we are calling for significant changes to 
prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, particularly with early morning flights and when flights are delayed," added 
Jacobs. 
Jacobs said Ryanair itself operates "strict guidelines" on dealing with disruptive customers and "very little alcohol" 
sold on board the carrier's flights, due to them being short-haul. 
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.0% at EUR18.34 Monday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airline easyJet PLC said on Friday it carried more passengers in July 
compared to a year earlier and increased its load factor year-on-year.
easyJet said it carried 8.2 million passengers in July, up 8.9% from 7.5 million a year before. On a 12 month rolling 
basis, passengers were up 8.9% to 78.8 million compared to 72.3 million.
Load factor also improved in July, up 1.1 percentage points to 96.8%, from 95.8% a year ago.
This followed rises in July passenger traffic and capacity reported on Thursday by International Consolidated 
Airlines Group SA, which owns British Airways, Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, and Irish airline Aer Lingus. 
On Wednesday, easyJet's budget airline peers Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC both also 
reported a rise in passenger numbers year-on-year in July.

LONDON (Alliance News) -  Ryanair has set an aim to achieve 67% growth in passengers by 2024, or another 80 
million passengers, but Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde is doubtful about this figure.
Ryanair reported a 12% increase in revenue to EUR1.9 billion for its first quarter to the end of June, and a 55% rise 
in profit after tax to EUR397 million. Cantor said these figures were helped by a later Easter holiday alongside 
better than expected yields. 
Although this result suggests that Ryanair is ahead of Cantor's forecast for full year profit after tax - EUR1,400 to 
1,450 million - this represents only one quarter and cannot be expected to continue.
The low cost airline also maintained an 8% decline in average fares as seen in the second half of the financial year, 
which in turn leaves manoeuvring space to discount fares through winter and keep cabins full.
Furthermore, Cantor sees growth opportunities for Ryanair within Europe, such as taking advantage of an Alitalia 
bail out or make a move on the German market while Air Berlin continues to restructure. 
In late July The Times reported that Ryanair has made a "non-binding bid" for Alitalia, the Italian airline which went 
into administration for the second time in May.
Byde considers the stock to be "fairly valued", particularly given the expected price to earning ratio for 2018 of 15 
times is just above the five year price to earnings ratio average. Therefore, Cantor has increased its target price to 
EUR19 from EUR13.5, which is close to Ryanair's current trading price, down 1.1% at EUR18.20 on Thursday.
Cantor kept its hold recommendation for the Ryanair stock.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Passenger statistics and load factor growth at budget airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air in 
July imply "solid demand" into the peak summer period, according to Davy Research.
On Wednesday, Irish carrier Ryanair said customer traffic grew by 11% in July to 12.6 million customers from 11.3 
million in July 2016, as load factor rose by one percentage point to 97% from 96%.
On a rolling annual basis, customer traffic grew by 13% year-on-year to 125.1 million customers.
Meanwhile, Central and Eastern European focused airline Wizz Air reported a 24% rise in the number of 
passengers carried to 2.8 million from 2.3 million the year before, while load factor increased by 1.8 percentage 
point to 94.5% from 92.7%.
On a rolling annual basis, passenger traffic grew by 22% to 25.8 million from 21.2 million.
Davy noted that the load factor gains were achieved in spite of double-digit capacity growth at both airlines, which 
implies "solid demand into peak summer" and continues the load factor momentum at both airlines since June.
The broker said it expects a similarly strong volume gain from peer easyJet on Friday.
For their fiscal second quarters, Davy expects an 11% rise in traffic and flat load factor at Ryanair, and a one 
percentage point increase in load factor at Wizz Air.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 0.2% at EUR18.05 on Wednesday, while Wizz Air shares were down 0.2% to 
2,668.00 pence.

UK Government Urged To Pressure EU Over "Shameful" Airport Queues

LONDON (Alliance News) - The UK government has been urged to use "whatever influence it can" to pressure 
European Union states to adequately staff their airports after British holidaymakers faced chaos at passport 
controls.
Tourists arriving in some popular destinations have been met with "shameful" immigration lines hundreds of metres 
long - some having to wait for up to four hours - as staff carry out tighter counter-terror checks, according to one 
lobby group.
Experts have warned that travellers heading to some popular European destinations this summer may face 
increasing disruption as the new measures are rolled out.
Airlines UK, an industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said it had warned the Department for Transport 
about the problem in May, although they were told by ministers the issue had eased.
Tim Alderslade, the body's chief executive, said: "Clearly the situation has changed markedly as we enter peak 
holiday season, and it is now up to the UK government to work with industry to use whatever influence it can within 
the EU to persuade Schengen Member States to resource their border operations properly."
New European Union rules introduced following terror attacks in Paris and Brussels require countries to carry out 
more stringent checks on travellers entering and leaving the Schengen area, which allows passport-free movement 
across much of the EU.
The change means the details of passengers from non-Schengen countries, such as the UK, are run through 
databases to alert authorities if they are known to pose a threat.
However Alderslade said attempts to improve resources at border controls had "failed to happen thus far".
He added: "It is passengers and consumers - many of whom are from the UK - who are suffering as a 
consequence."
UK Government Urged To Pressure EU Over "Shameful" Airport Queues
Pictures on social media in recent days have shown long lines of passengers in crowded terminals.
Lobby group Airlines For Europe (A4E) said passengers arriving at airports in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and 
Belgium are being forced to endure long waits to get through immigration.
The group, which represents carriers including easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC and British Airways' parent 
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, claimed some passengers are missing their flights because of the 
issue.
A4E managing director Thomas Reynaert said passengers had been left "devastated".
He said: "Travellers face long lines and can't get on their flights. Queuing for up to four hours has been the top 
record these days.
"Airports like Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Lisbon, Lyon, Paris-Orly, Milan or Brussels are producing shameful 
pictures of devastated passengers in front of immigration booths, in lines stretching hundreds of metres.
"At some airports, flight delays have increased by 300% compared to last year."
A4E warned the situation could worsen in the coming weeks as the new regulations have not yet been fully 
implemented. The six-month period to put the enhanced checks in place ends on October 7.
A spokeswoman for travel trade organisation Abta said: "New, stricter passport checks are resulting in longer 
queues at some airports, including Palma, which is already busy due to a significant increase in passenger 
numbers.
"Tour operators will ensure that customers get to the airport in plenty of time so that they are not in danger of 
missing their flights.
"However, independent travellers will need to check the situation with their airlines and, where necessary, ensure 
they factor these longer queuing times into their travel plans when flying in and out of the airport.
"It is also extremely important that border control check points are sufficiently resourced so that queuing times are 
kept to a minimum."
Travellers at Barcelona's El Prat airport have faced further disruption in the past week amid unofficial strike action 
by security staff.
Aceta, the association of Spanish air transport companies, said some airlines had to delay flights because many of 
their passengers could not board on time.
The firm said since July 24 around 1,000 passengers had not made their flights.
One Briton tweeted on Tuesday: "22 people were not allowed on flight home from Barcelona airport yesterday 
afternoon. Plane left most empty. Security queue."

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks may open higher on Tuesday as US Treasury 
yields climbed, oil extended overnight gains, and the dollar rebounded from its lowest level in more than a year in 
the wake of stronger-than-expected readings on US factory and services activity.
Oil rose further after climbing more than 1% in the overnight session as Saudi Arabia pledged to curb exports from 
August and Nigeria agreed to curb production to rein in global oversupply.
Also, Haliburton Co's executive chairman said the US shale drilling boom would probably ease next year.
The Fed's two-day policy meeting starts later Tuesday, with investors looking for clues on whether the US central 
bank will begin reducing its bond portfolio at its September meeting.
Meanwhile, Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, told Senate investigators on 
Monday he had contacts with Russian officials four times last year, but he nor anyone in the Trump campaign team 
colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 US election.
In economic releases, investors await a key survey of business sentiment from Germany later in the day.
Asian stocks are trading mostly higher, although gains remained muted outside Australia ahead of Fed meeting.
Overnight, US stocks ended mixed as investors braced for a busy week of earnings and a meeting of the Federal 
Reserve. The Dow dropped 0.3% and the S&P 500 edged down 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4% to 
close at a fresh record high.
European markets hit two-week lows on Monday after Ryanair warned of increased competition and EU antitrust 
regulators said they are investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German carmakers.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index shed 0.2%, the German DAX slid 0.3% and the UK's FTSE 100 lost 1% 
while France's CAC 40 index edged up 0.2%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Monday first quarter profit rose as the budget airline 
benefited from Easter falling within the quarter. 
For the quarter ended June 30, pretax profit increased 55% to EUR397.0 million from EUR256.0 million for the 
same quarter the year before. Ryanair said it expects pretax profit for the full-year to be between EUR1.40 billion to 
EUR1.45 billion. 
Quarterly revenue grew 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion as traffic rose 12% to 35.0 million from 31.2 
million. 
The London-listed airline said it expects average fares to decline by about 5% for the first half of the financial year 
as it aims to grow traffic by almost 11%. 
Ryanair said it expects the pricing environment to remain "very competitive" into the second half, where it maintains 
its guidance for an average fare decline of 8%. 
Ryanair's unit costs fell 6% in the quarter as the fuel bill decreased despite the 12% rise in traffic. Excluding fuel, 
unit costs fell 3% due to weaker sterling, which the airline said will be reversed in the second half of the financial 
year due to more difficult year-on-year comparisons.
It added that it remains on-track to deliver its previously guided ex-fuel unit cost reduction of 1% in the 2018 
financial year.
“We are pleased to report this 55% increase in profit after tax to EUR397.0 million but caution that the outcome is 
distorted by the absence of Easter in the prior year first quarter," Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said.
“While first quarter average fares rose by 1% to just over EUR40, this was due to a strong April, boosted by Easter, 
offset by adverse sterling, lower bag revenue as more customers switch to our two free carry-on bag policy, and 
yield stimulation following a series of security events in Manchester and London."

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC reported Monday its first-quarter profit after tax 
climbed 55% to EUR397 million from last year's EUR256 million. Earnings per share grew 63% to 32.66 euro cents 
from 20.01 euro cents a year ago.
The company attributed the growth in profit to the timing of Easter in first quarter, with no holiday period in the prior 
year comparative.
Revenue increased 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion last year.
Traffic grew 12% to 35 million customers from last year's 31.2 million, as Ryanair's lower fares and "Always Getting 
Better" or AGB programme delivered a record 96% load factor, up 2 percentage points.
Looking ahead, the company said it continues to guide fiscal 2018 profit after tax in a range of EUR1.40 billion to 
EUR1.45 billion. This guidance remains heavily dependent on summer bookings, H2 average fares, and the 
absence of any further security events, ATC strikes or negative Brexit developments, Ryanair said.
Further, the company said that it is raising FY18 traffic target to 131 million, up 1 million on previous guidance, 
thanks to the higher first quarter load factors and the completion of winter '17 schedule. 
After a difficult winter last year, the company said it expects the pricing environment to remain very competitive into 
H2 where traffic will be higher by approximately 7%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported growth in first-quarter 
profit as it benefited from the later timing of Easter this year, and The Times reported that the airline has made a 
"non-binding bid" for Italian carrier Alitalia.
But, shares in Ryanair were trading down 2.8% at EUR17.59 on Monday, as it continued to warn on the effect 
Brexit may have on its operations and said it expects fares to keep falling in a "very competitive" environment.
For the quarter ended June 30, pretax profit increased by 55% to EUR443.7 million from EUR286.5 million for the 
same quarter the year before. 
Quarterly revenue grew by 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion, as traffic rose by 12% to 35.0 million from 
31.2 million and average fares increased by 1% to just over EUR40.
Despite the good news, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary cautioned that "the outcome is distorted by the absence of 
Easter in the prior-year first quarter", which is why the first quarter this year was stronger than last year.
Profit after tax increased to EUR397.0 million in the quarter from EUR256.0 million, and Ryanair said it expects 
post-tax profit for the full year to be between EUR1.40 billion and EUR1.45 billion, up from EUR1.32 billion in the 
prior financial year.
"This guidance remains heavily dependent on close-in summer bookings, second-half average fares, and the 
absence of any further security events, air traffic control strikes or negative Brexit developments," Ryanair said.
The London-listed airline said it expects average fares to decline by about 5% in the first half of the financial year 
versus the prior year, as it aims to grow traffic by almost 11% year-on-year. 
It added that it expects the pricing environment to remain "very competitive" into the second half, where it 
maintained its guidance for an average fare decline of 8% and said it expects traffic to rise by 7%.

Ryanair's unit costs fell 6% in the first quarter as its total overall fuel bill decreased despite the 12% rise in traffic. 
Excluding fuel, unit costs fell 3% due to weaker sterling, but the airline said this will be reversed in the second half 
of the financial year due to more difficult year-on-year comparisons.
It added that it remains on track to deliver its previously guided ex-fuel unit cost reduction of 1% in the 2018 
financial year, while its fuel hedging should deliver annual savings of EUR70.0 million.
Ryanair, which had actively campaigned for the UK to remain in the European Union, also said on Monday it 
remains concerned at the uncertainty which surrounds the UK's departure from the bloc.
"While we continue to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU Open Skies agreement, we caution that should the 
UK leave, there may not be sufficient time, or goodwill on both sides, to negotiate a timely replacement bilateral 
which could result in a disruption of flights between the UK and Europe for a period of time from April 2019 
onwards," Ryanair warned.  
"We, like all airlines, seek clarity on this issue before we publish our summer 2019 schedule in the second quarter 
of 2018. If we do not have certainty about the legal basis for the operation of flights between the UK and the EU by 
autumn 2018, we may be forced to cancel flights and move some, or all, of our UK based aircraft to Continental 
Europe from April 2019 onwards," the group added.
Also on Monday, The Times reported that Ryanair has made a "non-binding bid" for Alitalia, the Italian airline which 
went into administration for the second time in May.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks were trading lower at midday on Monday, as strength in the pound and a 
downward revision to its UK growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund weighed on blue-chip stocks. 
The FTSE 100 index of large caps was down 0.9%, or 64.72 points, at 7,388.48. The FTSE 250 index of mid-caps 
was down 0.8% at 19,592.21 points, while the AIM All-Share index was broadly flat at 969.48.
The BATS UK 100 index was down 1.1% at 12,520.68, the BATS 250 down 0.8% at 17,801.69, and the BATS 
Small Companies down 0.1% at 12,090.32.
"The FTSE's losses really stepped up a gear this morning, the index hurt by the pound's own growth," said 
SpreadEx analyst Connor Campbell. 
"With the International Monetary Fund's downward revision to the UK's 2017 growth forecasts already weighing on 
the FTSE, the improvement in sterling's fortunes only served to make the index more miserable this Monday," 
Campbell added. 
While the IMF left its projections for global output growth unchanged at 3.5% for 2017 and 3.6% in 2018, the growth 
forecast was lowered for the US and the UK, while the Eurozone growth outlook was raised. 
The UK growth forecast was revised down for 2017 due to weaker-than-expected activity in the first quarter. The 
economy is forecast to grow 1.7% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3035 at midday, up from USD1.2959 at the London equities close on Friday.

On the other hand, Eurozone growth outlook was revised up, with the IMF citing stronger momentum in domestic 
demand than previously anticipated. GDP is forecast to climb 1.9% this year and 1.7% in 2018. The growth 
projections were revised from 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively.
The growth forecast in the US was revised down to 2.1% from 2.3% in 2017 and to 2.1% from 2.5% in 2018. The 
downward revision was based on the assumption that US fiscal policy will be less expansionary going forward.
"Those losses forced the FTSE back below 7,400, with other issues like easyJet's fall – caused by news that 
Ryanair is set to slash its fares after it secured lower fuel prices for the next two years – and a dismal showing from 
the commodity sector also playing their part," SpreadEx analyst Campbell said. 
Data from IHS Markit also was at the forefront of economic news. The squeeze on UK household finances 
intensified in July, while Eurozone private sector growth slowed for the second successive month in July to the 
lowest since January.
According to data compiled each month by IHS Markit, using data collected by Ipsos MORI, the UK household 
finance index dropped to 41.8 in July from 43.7 in June. The score was well below the 50.0 no-change mark and 
revealed the fastest deterioration in financial wellbeing for exactly three years.
The index measuring expectations for UK household finances came in at 47.0 in July, up from 45.8 in June. At 51.0, 
down from 52.6 in June, the index measuring workplace activity eased to its lowest reading for 12 months. Further, 
the gauge for living costs and inflation expectations climbed to 80.7 in July from 79.2 in June.
The proportion of UK households anticipating an increase in the Bank of England base rate during the next six 
months fell to 27% in July from 34% in June.
"July's survey highlights that the recent moderation in inflationary pressures has yet to provide much relief to UK 
household finances," Tim Moore, a senior economist at IHS Markit, said.
For the eurozone, IHS Markit flash data showed that the composite output index fell to a six-month low of 55.8 in 
July from 56.3 in June. The reading was expected to drop marginally to 56.2.
The services PMI index remained unchanged at 55.4 in July. The expected reading was 55.5. The factory PMI 
declined more than expected to 56.8 in July from 57.4 in June. The score was seen at 57.2.
German private sector output growth slowed for the second month in July. The composite output index slid to 55.1 
in July from 56.4 in June. This was the weakest expansion since January. However, output has risen continuously 
since May 2013, the second-longest sequence of growth since the series started in January 1998.
France's private sector output grew at the slowest pace in six months in July. The composite output index fell to a 6-
month low of 55.7 in July from 56.6 in June. Softer increases in output were seen across both manufacturers and 
service providers in July.
SpreadEx's Campbell said it was a "disappointing set of region-wide PMIs" in Europe.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 0.1% and 0.6%, 
respectively.
US Markit services and manufacturing PMIs will be released at 1445 BST, followed by US existing home sales at 
1500 BST.

UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will meet US trade representative Robert Lighthizer for two days of talks 
at the first UK-US trade and investment working group. European Union rules mean the UK cannot sign a deal until 
after it has quit the bloc, but the discussions will pave the way for a future potential free trade agreement.
"Although it's too early to say exactly what would be covered in a potential deal, the working group is the means to 
ensure we get to know each other's issues and identify areas where we can work together to strengthen trade and 
investment ties," said Fox. 
"Our work as an international economic department has never been more important and our exit from the European 
Union offers an unprecedented opportunity to reshape our independent trading ambitions and build on the already 
strong trading relationship with our single largest trading partner - the US," the UK minister added. 
Wall Street was called for a lower open on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seen down 0.2%, while 
the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 index both were pointed for a marginally lower open. 
In the US corporate calendar, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc is due to release second-quarter results after 
the US market close. 
Back in London, airlines were losing ground after low-cost operator Ryanair Holdings said the pricing environment 
will remain "very competitive" into the second half of 2017, as it aims to lower average fares by 8%. 
For the quarter ended June 30, Ryanair reported a rise in pretax profit of 55% to EUR397.0 million from EUR256.0 
million the year before. Ryanair said it expects pretax profit for the full-year to be between EUR1.40 billion to 
EUR1.45 billion.
Quarterly revenue grew 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion as traffic rose 12% to 35.0 million from 31.2 
million.
Ryanair was trading down 3.4%. The guidance on fares dragged down other London-listed airlines as well, with 
easyJet and British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines both trading down 3.1%.
Elsewhere, Provident Financial was the worst blue-chip performer, down 4.4%. The subprime lender's shares were 
lower ahead of its interim results on Tuesday, which is its first earnings report since its profit warning last month. 
The company previously warned the restructuring of its Consumer Credit division will see underlying profit in 2017 
drop by almost half. 
Clothing retailer Next was trading down 3.1%, at 3,710.0 pence, after RBC Capital cut its target price on the stock 
to 4,000.0 pence from 4,300.0p. 
In the FTSE 250, Cranswick was among the best performers, up 4.1%. The pork and poultry products maker said it 
made a positive start to its current financial year, and reiterated its full-year guidance. 
Revenue for the first quarter ended June 30 saw growth of 27% over the same period the year before, and on a 
like-for-like basis, revenue increased by 21%, due to strong domestic volume growth, and all product categories 
contributing positively.
B&M European Value Retail was up 3.1%. Asda is exploring a GBP4.4 billion takeover of the variety retailer, which 
is run by billionaire brothers Simon and Bobby Arora, The Sunday Times reported. The UK's third-biggest 
supermarket chain, part of US retailing giant Wal-Mart Stores, is understood to be in the early stages of assessing a 
bid for B&M, according to the newspaper.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Stocks Sink On Strong Pound, IMF 's UK Downgrade
Acacia Mining was the worst mid-cap performer, down 12%, after having its price target cut by both Jefferies and 
JPMorgan. 
Petra Diamonds was close behind, down 9.3%, after the diamond miner missed its annual guidance for both 
production and revenue by around 9%, despite both metrics hitting record levels in the year to the end of June. 
Annual production amounted to 4.0 million carats, up from 3.7 million carats the year before. The guided range for 
the period was 4.4 million to 4.8 million carats. Revenue for the year rose 11% to hit a record level of USD477.0 
million from USD430.9 million the year before, but that too missed expectations by about 9%. 
However, Petra did maintain its production guidance for the new financial year to end in June 2018, reiterating a 
targeted range of 4.8 million to 5.0 million carats. The miss in the recently-ended year means output is now forecast 
to rise between 20% and 25%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London opened lower on Monday in the face of a firm pound and an IMF cut 
to UK and US growth forecasts, as cautious outlook statements knocked Ryanair and Reckitt Benckiser stocks 
despite the two firms reporting profit rises. 
The FTSE 100 index of large caps was down 0.4%, or 30.01 points at 7,422.90. The FTSE 250 index was down 
0.3% at 19,688.10 points, while the AIM All-Share index was flat at 969.92.
The BATS UK 100 index was down 0.4% at 12,598.95,  and the BATS 250 was down 0.1% at 17,928.04. The 
BATS Small Companies was flat at 12,110.10.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3008, gaining from USD1.2959 at the London equities close on Friday against a 
weak dollar.
Ryanair shares were down 4.4% in early trading, as despite a quarterly profit rise, the budget airline warned its 
fares will keep falling in the second-half. 
For the quarter ended June 30, pretax profit increased 55% to EUR397.0 million from EUR256.0 million for the 
same quarter the year before. Ryanair said it expects pretax profit for the full-year to be between EUR1.40 billion to 
EUR1.45 billion.
Quarterly revenue grew 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion as traffic rose 12% to 35.0 million from 31.2 
million.
However, the London-listed airline said it expects average fares to decline by about 5% for the first half of the 
financial year as it aims to grow traffic by almost 11%. Ryanair said it expects the pricing environment to remain 
"very competitive" into the second half, where it maintains its guidance for an average fare decline of 8%.

The fare guidance dragged down peers as well. easyJet was down 3.4% and International Consolidated Airlines 
down 2.2%. 
Reckitt Benckiser also faced selling despite reporting an interim profit rise, with the stock trading down 1.7%. The 
consumer goods firm said pretax profit in the first half of the year grew to GBP1.02 billion from GBP697.0 million the 
year before, as net revenue rose 14% to GBP5.02 billion from GBP4.39 billion.
Revenue was boosted by the depreciation of sterling against Reckitt's other selling currencies, but net revenue at 
constant exchange rates still rose by 2%.
On a like-for-like basis, however, net revenue slipped by 1%, due to Reckitt's IT systems being hit by global 
ransomware attack Petya and due to the implementation of a new Goods & Services Tax in India. Reckitt reiterated 
its full-year like-for-like net revenue target of 2% growth
In the FTSE 250, B&M European Value Retail was up 4.8% after a Sunday Times report that Asda is considering a 
takeover bid for the chain. The UK's third-biggest supermarket chain, part of US retailing giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc, 
is understood to be in the early stages of assessing a bid for B&M, according to the newspaper. 
At its closing price of 340.27 pence per share on Friday, B&M had a market capitalisation of GBP3.40 billion, and 
The Times argued that "applying a normal takeover premium" would give a takeover price of about GBP4.4 billion.
At the other end of the mid-cap index, Acacia Mining was down 8.3% after having its target price cut to 240.0 pence 
from 265.0p by Jefferies. The miner continues to struggle with legislative changes in Tanzania, seeing its interim 
revenue fall and cutting its production guidance last week. 
In economic news, the International Monetary Fund left its global growth projections unchanged in a quarterly 
update, but cut its US and UK view.
The IMF left projections for global output growth unchanged at 3.5% this year and 3.6% in 2018, according to 
Monday's quarterly update of the IMF's forecast.
"The recovery in global growth that we projected in April is on a firmer footing," said Maurice Obstfeld, chief 
economist at the Washington-based crisis lender. "There is now no question mark over the world economy's gain in 
momentum."
However, the IMF cut its forecast for US output to expansion of 2.1% this year and next; three months ago, the 
outlook for 2017-18 was 2.4%.
The reduction came as the the IMF slashed its expectations for expansionary federal budget policies, as President 
Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and infrastructure projects have yet to gain traction in Congress.
The IMF also significantly pared its expectations through 2018 for Saudi Arabia, Brazil and the UK. The UK's output 
forecast was revised down to 1.7% from 2.0% in 2017.
"The ultimate impact of Brexit on the UK remains unclear," Obstfeld said.
Work will begin on preparing the ground for a post-Brexit trade deal with the US when the UK international trade 
secretary flies into Washington. Liam Fox will meet trade representative Robert Lighthizer for two days of talks at 
the first UK-US trade and investment working group.
European Union rules mean the UK cannot sign a deal until after it has quit the bloc but the discussions will pave 
the way for a future potential free trade agreement.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris was flat and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 0.4%.

France's private sector output grew at the slowest pace in six months in July, flash survey data from IHS Markit 
showed Monday. The composite output index fell to a 6-month low of 55.7 in July from 56.6 in June. Nonetheless, a 
score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. Softer increases in output were seen across both manufacturers 
and service providers in July.
The economic calendar on Monday continues with Markit services and manufacturing PMIs for Germany at 0830 
BST, the Eurozone at 0900 BST and the US at 1445 BST. Elsewhere in the economic calendar on Monday, US 
existing home sales is at 1500 BST.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 0.4%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.
The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to expand in June, albeit at a slightly slower pace, the latest survey 
from Nikkei revealed on Monday with an eight-month low manufacturing PMI score of 52.2. That was down from 
52.4 in June.
Wall Street ended mostly flat on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2% and the S&P 500 and 
the Nasdaq Composite both broadly flat.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are called to open slightly lower on Monday, as sterling held firm over 
the weekend despite the IMF cutting its forecast for UK growth, while Ryanair reported a significant first-quarter 
profit increase. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open 2.41 points lower at 7,450.50. The blue-chip index closed 
down 0.5%, or 34.96 points, at 7,452.91 on Friday. 
The pound was quoted at USD1.3017 compared to USD1.2959 at the London equities close on Friday.

In the revision issued from Kuala Lumpur of its World Economic Outlook, the IMF raised its forecasts across the 
eurozone, as well as for emerging and developing Europe, China and Canada.
The most important lowered outlook was for the US, where the IMF slashed its expectations for expansionary 
federal budget policies, as President Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and infrastructure projects have yet to gain 
traction in Congress. 
The revised IMF forecast is for US output to expand by 2.1% this year and next; three months ago, the outlook for 
2017-18 was 2.4%.

forecast was revised down to 1.7% from 2.0% in 2017. 
"The ultimate impact of Brexit on the UK remains unclear," Obstfeld said.
In early corporate news, budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported Monday its first-quarter profit after tax climbed 
55% to EUR397 million from last year's EUR256 million. The company attributed the growth in profit to the timing of 
Easter in first quarter, with no holiday period in the prior year comparative.
Revenue increased 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion last year.
Looking ahead, the company said it continues to guide fiscal 2018 profit after tax in a range of EUR1.40 billion to 
EUR1.45 billion. After a difficult winter last year, the company said it expects the pricing environment to remain very 
competitive into H2 where traffic will be higher by approximately 7%.
Meanwhile, Asda is exploring a GBP4.4 billion takeover of B&M European Value Retail SA, the FTSE 250-listed 
discount chain run by billionaire brothers Simon and Bobby Arora, The Sunday Times reported.
The UK's third-biggest supermarket chain, part of US retailing giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc, is understood to be in the

on Friday, B&M had a market capitalisation of GBP3.40 billion, and The Times argued that "applying a normal 
takeover premium" would give a takeover price of about GBP4.4 billion.
The move follows J Sainsbury's purchase of retailer Argos last year, and Tesco's ongoing GBP3.70 billion 
acquisition of London-listed wholesaler Booker Group. 
Gold producer Randgold Resources said its Tongon gold mine in Cote d'Ivoire continues to ramp up production as 
it tracks its 2017 target of 285,000 ounces.
Chief Executive Mark Bristow said that, with Tongon now operating to plan, the company's focus had shifted to 
finding additional reserves and resources to replace depleted ounces and extend the mine's life beyond its current 
four-year horizon.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index is down 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.4%, while the

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are seen opening lower on Monday, as the pound remains firm 
despite an IMF cut to its economic forecasts for the UK and the US, while Reckitt Benckiser and Ryanair kicked off 
a busy week of corporate earnings with significant profit rises. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open 9.61 points lower at 7,443.00. The blue-chip index closed 
down 0.5%, or 34.96 points, at 7,452.91 on Friday.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3006 compared to USD1.2959 at the London equities close on Friday.
Consumer goods firm Reckitt Benckiser reported pretax profit of GBP1.02 billion for the six months to June 30, 
rising significantly from GBP697.0 million in the same period in 2016. 
Net revenue from continuing operations 14% to GBP5.02 billion from GBP4.39 billion year-on-year. However, in 
constant currencies this represented 2% revenue growth, and in like-for-like terms the company saw revenue dip 
1%. 
As previously reported, Reckitt Benckiser has adjusted its full-year net revenue target to growth of 2%, down from 
3%, following the impact of a cyber-attack. 
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported Monday its first-quarter profit after tax climbed 55% to EUR397 million

In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.6%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.
The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to expand in June, albeit at a slightly slower pace, the latest survey 
from Nikkei revealed on Monday with an eight-month low manufacturing PMI score of 52.2.

That was down from 52.4 in June, although it remains well above the line of 50 that separates expansion from 
contraction.
Wall Street ended mostly flat on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2% and the S&P 500 and 
the Nasdaq Composite both broadly flat.
The economic calendar on Monday is focused on Markit services and manufacturing PMIs for France at 0800 BST,

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stock markets fell on Monday, with airline shares and 
automakers coming under selling pressure, after Ryanair warned of increased competition in the months ahead and 
EU antitrust regulators said they are investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German carmakers.
Brexit worries, the recent strength of the euro and weak eurozone economic data indicating slower growth also 
dented investor sentiment ahead of the Fed's latest policy meeting, due this week.
The eurozone private sector started the third quarter on a solid footing but the pace of growth slowed for the second 
successive month in July, flash data from IHS Markit showed. The composite output index fell to a 6-month low of 
55.8 in July from 56.3 in June.
The pound advanced against the euro despite an IMF cut to its UK GDP growth forecast and data showing that the 
squeeze on UK household finances intensified in July.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down half a percent at 378.22 in late opening deals after falling over 1% to 
log its biggest single-day loss in three weeks on Friday.
The German DAX was losing 0.7%, France's CAC 40 index was moving down 0.3% and the UK's FTSE 100 was 
declining 0.9%.
Automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen tumbled 3-4% after reports that EU regulators are studying reports of 
cartel among German carmakers.
Ryanair lost 2.5% in London after the budget airline said it expects the pricing environment to remain very 
competitive in the second half of the year.
British Airways owner International Airlines Group fell as much as 5% and easyJet shed 2%.
European Shares Extend Losses On Currency Woes
Gemalto plunged 16% after the digital security company announced a goodwill impairment charge of around 
EUR420 million.
On the positive side, Philips Electronics shares rallied 3% in Amsterdam after the Dutch consumer electronics giant 
reported a rise in second-quarter net income from continuing operations on higher sales and orders.
Switzerland's third largest private bank Julius Baer jumped 7% on reporting a 6% rise in assets under management 
in the first six months of 2017.
B&M European Value Retail shares soared 4.2%. The Sunday Times reported that Asda, the UK supermarket arm 
of Wal-Mart Stores, is considering a GBP4.4 billion takeover of the British discount retailer.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The majority of the European markets ended the first trading 
day of the new week in negative territory. Airline stocks were under pressure after Ryanair warned of increased 
competition in the months ahead. Automakers also weakened after EU antitrust regulators said they are 
investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German carmakers.
Traders were also in a cautious mood ahead of the upcoming policy statement from the Federal Reserve on 
Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged, but traders will be keeping a close watch on the 
accompanying statement for any clues about future rate hikes.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.41%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks increased 0.04%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.44%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 0.25%, but the CAC 40 of France fell 0.20%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 
1.01% and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.45%.
In Frankfurt, automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen tumbled 2.5 to 3% after reports that EU regulators are 
studying reports of cartel among German carmakers. 
In Paris, Renault dropped 0.31% and rival Peugeot fell 1.30%.
In London, Ryanair lost 1.38% after the budget airline said it expects the pricing environment to remain very 
competitive in the second half of the year. British Airways owner International Airlines Group fell 0.76% and easyJet 
shed 2.82%.
Reckitt Benckiser Group declined 3.27% after the consumer goods giant reduced its annual net revenue target to 
2% from 3%.
B&M European Value Retail increased 4.87%. The Sunday Times reported that Asda, the UK supermarket arm of 
Wal-Mart Stores, is considering a 4.4 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) takeover of the British discount retailer.
European Markets Finish Mostly Lower As Airlines & Autos Drop
Gemalto plunged 19.73% in Amsterdam after the digital security company announced a goodwill impairment charge 
of around 420 million euros ($489 million).
Philips Electronics gained 4% after the consumer electronics giant reported a rise in second-quarter net income 
from continuing operations on higher sales and orders.
Julius Baer jumped 4.47% in Zurich after reporting a 6% rise in assets under management in the first six months of 
2017.
Eurozone private sector started the third quarter on a solid footing, but the pace of growth slowed for the second 
successive month in July, largely due to the moderation in the manufacturing sector. The composite output index 
fell to a 6-month low of 55.8 in July from 56.3 in June, flash data from IHS Markit showed Monday. The reading was 
expected to drop marginally to 56.2.
German private sector output growth slowed for the second month in July, flash survey data from IHS Markit 
showed Monday. The composite output index slid to 55.1 in July from 56.4 in June. This was the weakest 
expansion since January.
France's private sector output grew at the slowest pace in six months in July, flash survey data from IHS Markit 
showed Monday. The composite output index fell to a 6-month low of 55.7 in July from 56.6 in June.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings reported its first-quarter profit after tax climbed 55% to EUR397 million from 
last year's EUR256 million. Earnings per share grew 63% to 32.66 euro cents from 20.01 euro cents a year ago. 
The company attributed the growth in profit to the timing of Easter in first quarter, with no holiday period in the prior 
year comparative. Revenue increased 13% to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.69 billion last year. Traffic grew 12% to 
35 million customers from last year's 31.2 million, as Ryanair's lower fares and "Always Getting Better" or AGB 
programme delivered a record 96% load factor, up 2 percentage points, it said.
----------
Anglo American said its platinum arm will contribute substantially less toward the group's first half results following a 
steep drop in underlying earnings in the first six months of 2017. The blue-chip multi-commodity miner holds a 
controlling 78% stake in Anglo American Platinum, the company that holds and operates nine mines and numerous 
smelting and refining assets in South Africa. Anglo American Platinum reported headline earnings of USD56.0 
million for the six months ended June 30, a 48% drop from USD107.0 million for the same period the year before. 
Anglo American Platinum will contribute USD37.0 million to Anglo American's underlying earnings for the first half of 
the year, down by 46% from USD68.0 million the prior year. The underlying earnings exclude certain exceptional 
items.
----------
GlaxoSmithKline said its investee company ViiV Healthcare has revealed data showing the durability and tolerability 
for a two-drug regimen for HIV maintenance. ViiV, which is majority owned by GSK with Pfizer Inc and Shiongi Ltd 
as shareholders, reported data from a 96 week LATTE-2 study which tested two-drug treatments for patients with 
HIV-1 infection which had already achieved viral suppression with a three-drug oral regimen of abotegravir and two 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. GSK said that, following 96 weeks of treatment, viral suppression rates 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: IMF Cuts Outlook For UK On Brexit Uncertainty
for the two-drug regimen dosed every eight weeks was 94% and for every four weeks it was 87%, compared to the 
rate observed in patients continuing with a three-drug oral regimen of 84%. 
----------
Household goods firm Reckitt Benckiser reported pretax profit of GBP1.02 billion for the six months to June 30, 
rising significantly from GBP697.0 million in the same period in 2016. Net revenue from continuing operations 14% 
to GBP5.02 billion from GBP4.39 billion year-on-year. However, in constant currencies this represented 2% 
revenue growth, and in like-for-like terms the company saw revenue dip 1%. As previously reported, Reckitt 
Benckiser has adjusted its full-year net revenue target to growth of 2%, down from 3%, following the impact of a 
cyber-attack.
----------
Gold producer Randgold Resources said its Tongon gold mine in Cote d'Ivoire continues to ramp up production as 
it tracks its 2017 target of 285,000 ounces. Chief Executive Mark Bristow said that, with Tongon now operating to 
plan, the company's focus had shifted to finding additional reserves and resources to replace depleted ounces and 
extend the mine's life beyond its current four-year horizon. Elsewhere in Cote d'Ivoire, Randgold Resources noted 
that its exploration programmes have defined a large target at Boundiali in the Fonondara corridor, which Bristow 
described as potentially the most exciting gold prospect in West Africa.
----------
Asda is exploring a GBP4.4 billion takeover of B&M European Value Retail, the discount chain run by billionaire 
brothers Simon and Bobby Arora, The Sunday Times reported. The UK's third-biggest supermarket chain, part of 
US retailing giant Wal-Mart Stores, is understood to be in the early stages of assessing a bid for B&M, according to 
the newspaper. At its closing price of 340.27 pence per share on Friday, B&M had a market capitalisation of 
GBP3.40 billion, and The Times argued that "applying a normal takeover premium" would give a takeover price of 
about GBP4.4 billion.
----------
HICL Infrastructure Co said it has made "steady progress" with its portfolio and reaffirmed its dividend guidance for 
the full-year. For the first quarter ended July 21, Chairman Ian Russell said HICL has "made steady progress, with 
portfolio performance and cash generation in line with expectations since the financial year end" on March 31. He 
reaffirmed the investment company's dividend guidance of 7.85 pence for the financial year ending March 31, 2018 
and 8.05p for financial year ending March 31, 2019, which reflected HICL's "continued confidence in the future cash 
flow generation from the portfolio and the overall performance of the company".
----------
UK pork and poultry producer Cranswick said it made a positive start to its current financial year, leaving it in its 
outlook for the full-year. Revenue for the first quarter ended June 30 saw growth of 27% over the same period the 
year before, and on a like-for-like basis, revenue increased by 21%, due to strong domestic volume growth, and all 
product categories contributing positively, the company said. Cranswick said it has continued its investment into its 
asset base, by increasing its capacity and capability, including the development of a new, purpose built products 
factory in Bury, Greater Manchester, which will contribute towards production from the company's two existing 
facilities.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were in the red after the IMF cut its economic growth forecasts for the UK and US. Subprime lender 
Provident Financial was the worst blue chip faller ahead of its interim results on Tuesday. The pound shrugged off 
the IMF's negative outlook on the UK to trade back above the USD1.30 mark. Wall Street was pointed to a lower 
open, with Google parent Alphabet set to report second-quarter earnings after the New York close.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The International Monetary Fund is leaving its projections for global output growth unchanged at 3.5% this year and 
3.6% in 2018, according to a quarterly update of the IMF's forecast released Monday. However, the official lender 
downgraded its outlook for both the US and UK. "The recovery in global growth that we projected in April is on a 
firmer footing," said Maurice Obstfeld, chief economist at the Washington-based crisis lender. "There is now no 
question mark over the world economy's gain in momentum." The IMF projects global trade growth approaching 4% 
in 2017-18, outpacing the world economy and well ahead of the 2015-16 trade growth of less than 2.5%. The IMF 
raised its forecasts across the eurozone, as well as for emerging and developing Europe, China and Canada. The 
most important lowered outlook was for the US. The IMF also significantly pared its expectations through 2018 for 
Saudi Arabia, Brazil and the UK. "The ultimate impact of Brexit on the UK remains unclear," Obstfeld said.
----------
The Eurozone private sector started the third quarter on a solid footing but the pace of growth slowed for the 
second successive month in July, flash data from IHS Markit showed. The composite output index fell to a 6-month 
low of 55.8 in July from 56.3 in June. The reading was expected to drop marginally to 56.2. Despite coming off 
recent highs, the index remained at an elevated level by historical standards and signalled one of the strongest 
expansions seen over the past six years, Markit said. The services Purchasing Managers' Index remained 
unchanged at 55.4 in July. The expected reading was 55.5. The factory PMI declined more than expected to 56.8 in 
July from 57.4 in June. The score was seen at 57.2.
----------
Work will begin on preparing the ground for a post-Brexit trade deal with the US when the UK international trade 
secretary flies into Washington. Liam Fox will meet trade representative Robert Lighthizer for two days of talks at 
the first UK-US trade and investment working group. European Union rules mean the UK cannot sign a deal until 
after it has quit the bloc but the discussions will pave the way for a future potential free trade agreement. Fox said: 
"The first meeting of the UK-US trade and investment working group is the start of the next chapter in our special 
relationship.
----------
Six months after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, the Democrats hope to wrestle back the political 
initiative at the launch of a new economy agenda on Monday. Democratic lawmakers from both the Senate and 
House of Representatives will unveil the plan entitled "A Better Deal" in Berryville in rural Virginia, a Sunday press 
release from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said. The plan, likely named in reference to the title of 
Trump's "The Art of the Deal" book, will set out how the Democratic party plans to improve jobs, wages and the 
country's future "to make the economy work for all Americans, not special interests or just the wealthiest few." The 
Democratic party is currently in the minority in both houses of Congress and struggling to make political capital out 
of a series of recent gaffes from the Trump administration.
----------
The White House needs to adjust its messaging somewhat, new communications director Anthony Scaramucci 
said. The hedge-fund founder, a relative political novice, was named Friday to the White House post, which was 
vacant since May. Scaramucci joins the White House with Trump's approval ratings among the lowest ever for a 
president in his first six months in office. The latest national survey, released Saturday by the Gallup Poll, found 
38% of respondents approved of his job performance, while 57% disapproved. "I just think we need to deliver the 
messaging a little bit differently than we've been doing it in the past," Scaramucci told broadcaster CNN. His 
appointment was followed immediately by the resignation Friday of White House spokesman Sean Spicer.
----------
The top Democrat on the US Senate panel investigating Russian election meddling warned Friday that President 
Trump should not pardon associates who could be implicated in a separate criminal probe into the matter. "The 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: IMF Cuts Outlook For UK On Brexit Uncertainty
possibility that the president is considering pardons at this early stage in these ongoing investigations is extremely 
disturbing," said Warner. "Pardoning any individuals who may have been involved would be crossing a fundamental 
line." Mark Warner's statement followed a report by the Washington Post that Trump recently discussed his 
presidential pardon power with advisers, including asking about pardoning aides, relatives and himself.

Ryanair Calls For End To Delays In Implementing Second Dublin Runway
Ryanair Calls For End To Delays In Implementing Second Dublin Runway

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Wednesday it has called for an end to 
the delays in delivering a second runway at Dublin Airport, urging the Attorney General's Department to expedite 
the primary legislation to make the Irish Aviation Authority responsible for monitoring noise regulation.
Ryanair said it has supported the development of a EUR240.0 million second runway at Dublin, believing it critical 
to the continued growth of air travel to and from Ireland, especially in the face of Brexit.
"The present runway infrastructure at Dublin Airport is already full at peak times. The development of the second 
runway is a critical piece of national infrastructure which needs to be expedited, especially when Ireland is trying to 
attract overseas investment that may be leaving the UK in the run up to Brexit in March 2019. Ryanair is unable to 
base additional aircraft at Dublin because there are no spare slots in the early morning for additional departures. 
The fact that this statutory instrument has been repeatedly delayed in the Attorney General's office for over 12 
months is unacceptable," said Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.
"We call on the government, the Department of Transport, and the Attorney General's office to explain these 
repeated delays and confirm when this necessary noise legislation will be implemented by statutory instrument to 
allow Dublin's second runway to proceed," Leary' added.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were up 0.2% at EUR18.90 on Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Monday it has cancelled its planned entry into Ukraine, 
following Kiev airport's failure to honour a growth agreement reached at the Ministry of Infrastructure in March.
The low-cost airline said "regrettably" Kiev airport has chosen to protect high fare airlines and, as a result, Ryanair 
will cancel four new Kiev routes and seven new Lviv routes. The company said this will result in the loss of over 
500,000 passengers and 400 jobs.
The group said it will refund those who had already booked Ryanair flights to Ukraine.
Shares in Ryanair closed up 1.8% at EUR18.74 on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - After initially moving higher, stocks have seen some further upside over the 
course of the trading session on Friday. The gains on the day are partly offsetting the losses posted by the major 
averages in the previous session.
Currently, the major averages are just off their highs of the session. The Dow is up 80.78 points or 0.4% at 
21,400.82, the Nasdaq is up 59.12 points or 1% at 6,148.58 and the S&P 500 is up 13.30 points or 0.6% at 
2,423.05.
The rebound on Wall Street comes following the release of a report from the Labor Department showing much 
stronger than expected job growth in the month of June.
The report said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 222,000 jobs in June following an upwardly revised 
increase of 152,000 jobs in May.
Economists had expected employment to climb by 179,000 jobs compared to the addition of 138,000 jobs originally 
reported for the previous month.
Despite the stronger than expected job growth, the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4% in June from 4.3% in 
May. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to hold steady.
The Labor Department also said average hourly employee earnings rose by 0.2% to USD26.25. Average hourly 
earnings in June were up by 2.5% year-over-year.
"This was a strong jobs report, with a better-than-expected payroll rise augmented by a solid upward revision," said 
Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial.
He added, "Still, it should not add to the already considerable fire under the FOMC because wage pressures are 
nowhere to be seen, and labor slack relaxed unexpectedly."
Major Averages Climb To New Highs In Mid-Day Trading - US Commentary
The Federal Reserve is scheduled to make its next decision on interest rates following a two-day meeting later this 
month.
Sector News
Airline stocks are seeing considerable strength in mid-day trading, with the NYSE Arca Airline Index climbing by 
1.9%. With the gain, the index has reached its best intraday level in over fifteen years.
SkyWest (SKYW), Ryanair (RYAAY) and American Airlines (AAL) are turning in some of the sector's best 
performances on the day.
Significant strength is also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 1.6% gain being posted by the 
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index is climbing further off the nearly two-month closing low set on 
Monday.
Internet, software, and housing stocks are also seeing notable weakness, while gold and energy stocks are under 
pressure amid steep drops by the prices of their associated commodities.
Other Markets
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Friday. 
Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.5%.
Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the UK's FTSE 100 
Index edged up by 0.1%, the German DAX Index closed just below the unchanged line and the French CAC 40 
Index dipped by 0.3%.
In the bond market, treasuries are seeing moderate weakness on the heels of the upbeat jobs data. As a result, the 
yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 2.3 basis points at 2.393%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Worldpay Group said it has received preliminary takeover approaches from both payment services provider Vantiv 
and financial services firm JPMorgan Chase Bank. The FTSE 100-listed payment processing firm noted a recent 
movement in its share price resulting from press speculation surrounding a takeover approach. "There can be no 
certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made," Worldpay said in a statement. 
Each of Vantiv and JP Morgan have a deadline of August 1 to confirm if they wish to make an offer for Worldpay. 
----------
J Sainsbury reported growth in sales in the first quarter of its financial year as it continued launching new products, 
and said it is "well-placed to navigate the external environment". The supermarket chain said retail sales in the 16 
weeks ended July 1 grew by 2.7% year-on-year, excluding fuel, while like-for-like sales rose by 2.3%, also 
excluding fuel. Grocery sales increased by 3.0% on the back of a 1.9% rise in transaction growth, which 
Sainsbury's said was thanks to "strong" food sales where it has invested in product innovation, such as its new 
Summer eating ranges.
----------
Oil field services firm Hunting said it expects to report a loss for the first half of 2017, due to low oil prices leading to 
continued weak US offshore and international drilling markets. Hunting said although it has benefited from an 
increase in onshore drilling in the US, its Well Construction and Well Intervention segments continue to see difficult 
market conditions. The firm said its outlook for the remainder of 2017 is predicated on "sustained US onshore 
drilling activity" driving trading, along with "cautious optimism for stable offshore and international markets". 
----------
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Worldpay Confirms Approach By Vantiv And JPMorgan
Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings reported growth in both the number of passengers carried 
and load factor in June year-on-year. Irish carrier Ryanair said it carried 12% more passengers in June to 11.8 
million from 10.6 million a year earlier, as load factor increased by 2 percentage points to 96% from 94%. On a 
rolling annual basis, traffic grew by 13% to 123.8 million passengers. Central and Eastern European-focused airline 
Wizz Air said it flew 24% more customers in June to 2.5 million from 2.0 million a year earlier, as load factor rose by 
0.6 percentage point to 92.3% from 91.7%.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were lower mid-morning as payments processor Worldpay led the blue-chip risers. The pound was 
slightly lower against the dollar as data showed UK construction sector growth eased more than forecast in June. 
Markets in the US were closed for the Independence Day holiday.
----------
FTSE 100: down 0.1% at 7,370.51
FTSE 250: down 0.1% at 19,295.31

(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Brexit is not a dominant issue for European Union countries, UK Chancellor Philip Hammond acknowledged as he 
called for jobs and prosperity to be the first priority in the negotiations. Hammond told business leaders that the UK 
had to remember that Brexit was "just one among many challenges" facing the other EU members. He said the 
government had to "focus relentlessly" on the key components of a free trade deal and customs agreement that 
"minimises friction", with transitional arrangements to avoid a cliff-edge change on the day the UK breaks away 
from Brussels. Curbing migration has been a key demand for many Brexit supporters, but Hammond said that while 
managing the system was important, businesses and public services must be able to recruit from overseas. 
----------
The UK public are "weary" of austerity but the government's approach to the public sector pay cap has not 
changed, Chancellor Hammond said. The government would continue to assess the balance between being fair to 
public servants and the taxpayers who fund their wages, the chancellor told business leaders. He said there had to 
be a "grown-up" debate about how to meet demands for improved public services, arguing that increasing 
economic growth or broad-based tax increases were the only ways to fund them. Hammond has come under 
pressure from some of his ministerial colleagues to ease the pay restraint which has seen public sector workers 
subjected to a 1% cap on wage rises since 2012, following a two-year freeze.
----------
British construction sector growth eased at a faster-than-expected pace in June, after reaching to a 17-month high 
in May, survey results from IHS Markit and Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply showed. The seasonally 
adjusted construction Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, dropped to 54.8 in June from 56.0 in May. Economists 
had expected the index to fall to 55.0. However, any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
----------
North Korea claimed it had successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile, the news agency Yonhap 
reported, despite international condemnation and calls for dialogue. In a special broadcast on state-run television, 
Pyongyang said the Hwasong-14 missile had reached a cruising altitude of 2,802 kilometres and had flown 933 
kilometres before landing in the Sea of Japan early Tuesday. South Korea had earlier said it was investigating the 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Worldpay Confirms Approach By Vantiv And JPMorgan
possibility that the rocket had been an ICBM, while US Pacific Command described it as an "intermediate range 
ballistic missile."
----------
Russian President Vladimir Putin was due to host his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Tuesday in Moscow for a 
day filled with meetings to reinforce ties between the eastern great powers. Russia and China have been 
strengthening economic and diplomatic relations in recent years amid waning ties with the US, which has opposed 
Russian and Chinese geopolitical policies.
----------
Brazilian President Michel Temer will attend this weekend's G20 meeting in Germany, reversing his previous 
decision to skip the summit and stay in Brazil where he has been charged with corruption, his office announced.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has ordered an additional 10 Airbus 
A321ceo aircraft, to join its fleet in 2018 and 2019.
Based on current list prices, the value of the new order is USD1.2 billion, although Wizz Air noted that Airbus has 
granted it "significant" discounts from list prices in the past.
Wizz Air has been operating the Airbus A321 since November 2015 and currently operates 19 of the 230-seat 
aircraft type with another 22 A321 aircraft to join the fleet by 2019. 
Wizz Air said it is achieving 10% unit cost savings with the A321 when compared to the A320.
The airline added that the new order, on top of the 110 A321neo aircraft it has ordered, will more than double the 
size of its fleet by 2024.
Shares in Wizz Air were trading up 0.2% at 2,315.00 pence on Wednesday.
The announcement came after rival budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it has bought a further 10 
Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft. 
The new order, valued at more than USD1.1 billion, adds to an existing order for 100 of the same aircraft. Ryanair 
said the total 110 aircraft will allow it to grow its traffic to 200 million customers per year by 2024.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it has bought a further 10 
Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft.
The first five aircraft will be delivered in the first half of 2019 and the second five in the first half of 2020.
The new order, valued at more than USD1.1 billion, adds to an existing order for 100 of the same aircraft. Ryanair 
said the total 110 aircraft will allow it to grow its traffic to 200 million customers per year by 2024.
According to Ryanair, the new aircraft will reduce fuel consumption by up to 16% and reduce noise emissions by 
40%, while offering 4% more seats per flights.
"This all new Max 737 aircraft has eight more seats than our current 189-seat Boeing 737-800s and incorporates 
the latest technology engines and winglets which reduces fuel consumption and noise emissions, ensuring we 
remain Europe's greenest, cleanest airline," Chief Operations Officer Mick Hickey said in a statement.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 0.4% at EUR18.69 on Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Societe Generale reiterated its Buy rating on Wizz Air Holdings, saying the central and 
eastern European airline could come close to challenging Irish peer Ryanair Holdings as the number one low-cost 
carrier in Europe. 
The French bank also raised its price target to 2,800 pence from 1,860p. Shares were up 0.8% at 2,315.00p on 
Monday. 
SocGen analysts Michael Kuhn and Sumit Mehrotra said Wizz Air has taken the fast track to developing a 
successful low-cost platform in Eastern Europe. It is the only low-cost carrier with unit costs that come close to 
competitor Ryanair's, making it one of two European ultra budget airlines. 
Kuhn and Mehrotra also pointed out that only 13 years after its first flight, Wizz Air is already generating industry-
leading margins, with significant economies of scale in Eastern and Western Europe yet to be generated.
The analysts said Wizz Air holds a market leading position in most central and eastern European countries.
"Wizz Air's origin and most important market is the CEE region, where GDP is growing nicely and which still offers 
significant growth potential. Several of its western European markets remain under-penetrated on low-cost aviation 
too," Kuhn and Mehrotra noted. 
With a much smaller fleet of around 80 aircraft, when compared to Ryanair's 380 and easyJet's 270, Wizz Air has 
become the second ultra low-cost carrier besides Ryanair in Europe.
As such, the pair argued that Wizz Air could become Ryanair's toughest competitor.
"Wizz Air still trades at a (justifiable) discount to its key peer Ryanair, as it lacks a long-term track record and it is 
much smaller. However, we expect Wizz Air to perform well and the fleet is set to grow fast, which should gradually 
dissolve the discount," the analysts said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Davy Research said UK airlines should benefit from "positive pricing trends" into the 
summer, especially low-cost air carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air. 
easyJet was among the best FTSE 100 performers on Wednesday, up 1.5% at 1,372.66 pence, after the Irish 
broker lifted its recommendation to Neutral from Underperform. 
Ryanair, up 1.3% at EUR18.42, was lifted to Outperform from Neutral, trading close to a record high of EUR18.73 
touched late May. 
Meanwhile, Wizz Air was up 0.3% at 2,424.00p, with Davy having reiterated a Neutral stance on the FTSE 250 
budget airline. Nevertheless, the stock had touched an all-time high of 2,425.00p at the open on Wednesday. 
"We believe that the European low-cost carriers will continue to see improving pricing trends as we approach peak 
summer," Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said.
"This trend is underpinned by improving demand profiles in key European markets, relatively easy comparisons 
(given terror-related and Brexit demand shocks in 2016) and slowing capacity growth," noted Furlong. 
Looking at the upcoming Brexit negotiations due to start next week, the analyst said "the only thing that is clear is 
uncertainty". 
"Two key themes dominate in the aviation space – traffic and ownership rights. Timing is particularly tight as airlines 
will want to publish their summer 2019 schedules up to a year in advance," said Furlong. 
The analyst said Ryanair is the most exposed to the Brexit negotiations due to start next week. 
Davy's Furlong said Brexit is a "material risk to the business", as the company's flights within the UK account just 
for around 2% of its network, while service between the UK and the European Union represents around 25% of the 
airline's business. 
IN THE KNOW: Budget Airlines Benefit From Prices Before Brexit Talks
"One possibility is to negotiate a new UK-EU bilateral agreement similar to Switzerland; however, this excludes two 
of the nine traffic freedom rights (in effect, all journeys on Swiss airlines must leave or arrive at a Swiss airport)," 
noted the analyst. 
Despite the Brexit risks, Ryanair remains the broker's "top pick", expecting the Irish carrier's shares to trade at 
EUR25 in the medium term, 33% up from where they are now. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is coming under intense pressure to change her approach to leaving the EU, with 
predecessor David Cameron among those suggesting a softer stance with a greater effort to seek a consensus.
Talks with the Democratic Unionist Party to secure her government broke up on Tuesday night without an 
agreement, but May said the discussions had been "productive".
The prime minister needs the votes of the 10 DUP MPs to prop up her minority Conservative administration as she 
hopes to steer government business - including crucial measures on Brexit - through the Commons.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Wednesday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
easyJet, up 1.4%. The low-cost carrier was raised to Neutral from Underperform by Davy Research. "We believe 
that the European low-cost carriers will continue to see improving pricing trends as we approach peak summer," 
Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said. In the FTSE 250, Wizz Air was up 0.2% at 2,421.00p, with Davy having 
reiterated a Neutral stance. Nevertheless, Wizz Air shares had touched an all-time high of 2,425.00p at the open on 
Wednesday. Ryanair Holdings was up 0.9% at EUR18.33. Ryanair remains the broker's "top pick", expecting the 
Irish carrier's shares to trade at EUR25 in the medium term, 33% up from where they are now.
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
GKN, down 1.0%. The automotive and aerospace engineer was downgraded to Sell from Hold by Panmure 
Gordon. The broker expects the shares to underperform going forward as it believes consensus expectations of 
double-digit growth in pretax profit and earnings per share for 2017 are too high. "At this stage, we see a slump in 
US auto market and delays/cancellations in Mid-East airlines as the primary catalysts for downgrades," Panmure 
said. 
Micro Focus International, down 0.7%. Citigroup cut the software company to Neutral from Buy. 
----------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: Buoyant Bellway Boosts Builders
Bellway, up 4.3%. The housebuilder said it expects its operating margin for the year to exceed the previous year 
due to a "strong" sales demand. Bellway said it expects its operating margin for the year ended July 31 to be 
slightly in excess of 22%, which would improve last year's "record" performance. From February 1 to June 4, 
Bellway said sales demand was "strong" across the UK, increased throughout spring and was not affected by the 
recent general election. The company reported a 13% increase in the reservation rate to 221 per week from 196 per 
week in the same period last year. "Robust market conditions, together with a clear operational focus, is enabling 
Bellway to continue increasing its contribution to the supply of much needed new homes," the company said. Blue-
chip housebuilding stocks also benefited, with Barratt Developments up 2.1%, while Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon 
were both 1.8% higher. 
CLS Holdings, up 2.7%. The property investment company said it has agreed to acquire a portfolio of 12 properties 
in Germany from Swiss-listed property group Zublin Immoblien, for EUR148.0 million, representing a net initial yield 
of 6.3%. The portfolio is primarily clustered around the cities of Hamburg, Dussledorf and Stuttgart, and comprises 
963,596 square feet of multi-let office space, with a current occupancy rate of 89%. It is let to 157 tenants with a 
weighted unexpired lease term of 3.3 years.
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
Halma, down 1.8%. HSBC cut the safety, health and environmental technology firm to Hold from Buy. Halma said 
Tuesday it saw a steep rise in its profit and revenue in its recently ended financial year, boosted by the effects of a 
weaker pound. 
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Gemfields, up 13% at 40.25 pence. The miner's shares recovered ground lost since its largest shareholder, 
Pallinghurst Resources, made an unsolicited approach for the business last month after a rival bidder entered the 
frame by tabling an initial proposal. Pallinghurst made its share and cash offer equal to 38.5p per share in May. On 
Wednesday, rival Fosun Gold confirmed it has made an "initial proposal" to takeover Gemfields in an all-cash deal 
for 40.85p per share, a 15% premium to the closing share price on Tuesday. Fosun Gold said its offer represents a 
10% premium to that offered by Pallinghurst. Fosun said Pallinghurst's offer is now equal to 37.10p per Gemfields 
share based on Pallinghurst's closing share price on Tuesday. As Pallinghurst's offer is a cash and share deal, 
movements in its own share price impact the implied value of Gemfields share under its offer. 
WANdisco, up 11%. The cloud computing company announced it had won a new USD2.0 million contract from an 
unnamed large US retailer. The US retailer will use WANdisco's big data and cloud product, WANdisco Fusion, on 
a three and half year subscription licence deal. London-listed WANdisco said its product will allow the retailer to 
"move active, critical data seamlessly between primary and disaster recovery sites and the cloud with no 
downtime". The retailer will also be able to "generate increased levels of efficiency within its existing disaster 
recovery portfolio, which could lead to a significant reduction in future storage capital expenditure and an improved 
ability to capture transactional data".

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London opened higher on Wednesday, with housebuilders among the best 
performers following an upbeat trading update from mid-cap Bellway, while blue-chip British American Tobacco was 
down despite saying trading was "in line".
Market attention in the morning is likely to be on UK employment and earnings figures at 0930 BST. Later in the 
day, investor focus will shift to the US, as the Federal Reserve reveals its monetary policy decision following the 
two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. 
The FTSE 100 index of London large caps was up 0.1%, or 8.94 points, at 7,509.38. The FTSE 250 index was up 
0.7% at 19,991.14 points, and the AIM All-Share index was up 0.2% at 974.68.
The BATS UK 100 index was up 0.1% at 12,734.10, and the BATS 250 up 0.6% at 17,167.05. The BATS Small 
Companies was up 0.2% at 11,976.73.
FTSE 250-listed Bellway was up 3.2% after saying it expects its operating margin for the current year to exceed the 
previous year due to a "strong" sales demand. The housebuilder expects the operating margin for the year ended 
July 31 to be slightly in excess of 22%, which would improve last year's "record" performance.
From February 1 to June 4, Bellway said that sales demand was "strong" across the UK, increased throughout 
spring and was not affected by the recent general election. 
Other housebuilding stocks benefited from Bellway's positive update, with FTSE 100-listed Taylor Wimpey and 
Barratt Developments both up 1.7%, while Persimmon was 1.6% higher. 
BAT shares were down 0.8%, among the biggest FTSE 100 fallers. The tobacco giant said trading is in line with 
expectations as the business continues to perform "very well" in the first half of 2017. The firm said revenue in the 
six months ending June 30 is expected to benefit from good pricing, as its Global Drive Brands help boost market-
share growth.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Housebuilders Lead Gains After Bellway Update
Volume will suffer against a strong prior-year comparator as well as from the phasing of shipments in a number of 
key markets. However full-year volume, which is expected to decline by 4%, should outperform the wider industry, 
BAT said.
BAT said it continues to expect profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year, mainly due to the timing 
of volume shipments, as well as the phasing of Next Generation Product investments and marketing spend.
easyJet was up 2.3%, the best blue-chip performer, while Ryanair Holdings was up 0.8% and Wizz Air up 0.3%. 
Davy Research said low-cost carriers should benefit from "positive pricing trends" into the summer.
easyJet was lifted to Neutral from Underperform by Davy, and Ryanair was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral. 
Wizz Air was left at Neutral. 
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were up 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.
In Asia on Tuesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended 
down 0.7%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was flat. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday softened her tone on her country's negotiations to leave the EU, 
welcoming the "good process" set out by the bloc for the talks.
Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after a working dinner in Paris, May said that with 
"willingness and intent on both sides to build...[a] future partnership," she believed a deal could be reached that 
would be in the interests of all sides.
Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said on Tuesday talks on supporting May's minority government are 
making progress and should be concluded soon. Talks are due to continue on Wednesday.
"Discussions are going well with the government and we hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful 
conclusion," Foster said on Twitter after talks at Downing Street, May's London office.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2786 on Wednesday after the London equities open, up from USD1.2729 at the 
close on Tuesday. 
Following the last lift to US interest rates in March, investors are well prepared for another 25 basis point increase 
to the Fed's target for the federal funds rate, which would take the range to between 1.00% and 1.25%.
The FOMC will announce its decision, alongside economic projections, at 1900 BST, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen 
hosting a press conference at 1930 BST.
Elsewhere in the economic calendar, in the US, MBA mortgage applications are at 1200 BST. Retail sales are at 
1330 BST, as well as the US consumer price index. EIA crude oil stocks are at 1530 BST.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The likely formation of a governing majority in the UK through the Conservatives and 
Democratic Unionist Party is likely to lead to softer Brexit and provide a boost to cross-border transport firms, but 
the weaker pound will not be welcomed.
With sterling already faltering and still struggling to find its feet following the Brexit referendum last year, the snap 
election result on Friday has not helped the currency find ground after the Conservative party did not achieve the 
outright majority that many had expected. 
However, the surprise result does present an opportunity for transport firms that are facing the possibility of new 
borders and a tougher time moving planes, trains and buses in and out of the UK and European Union. 
But, with the DUP in Northern Ireland not in support of a so-called hard Brexit, the result means the likelihood of a 
soft Brexit has increased, according to RBC Capital Markets Richard Hatch.  
"If the UK election result is perceived to reduce the probability of a hard Brexit, beneficiaries would include Wizz Air 
and Ryanair. Other beneficiaries from this include Eurotunnel, easyJet and IAG, however, weaker sterling is a 
headwind for these companies," said the analyst. 
While some of the London's major transport stocks benefit from a weaker pound when translating overseas 
earnings into the UK currency, such as those with US operations like National Express and FirstGroup, many will 
see weaker sterling as a headwind. 
"Immediate nationalisation risk may be reduced for Royal Mail and the bus and rail companies if a Conservative-led 
government is formed, but the election result is not likely to be seen as decisive in this regard," said Hatch.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Tuesday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
easyJet, up 1.1%. The low-cost carrier reported year-on-year growth in the number of customers carried in May. 
The airline said 9.5% more passengers flew with it in May, up to 7.5 million from 6.9 million a year ago. Load factor 
remained flat at 91.5%. Shares in Ryanair were down 0.4%, despite easyJet's rival reporting even better May 
results, with passengers carried up 11% and load factor increasing a notch to 95% from 94%.
Randgold Resources, up 0.7%. The gold miner was benefiting from a rise in the precious metal's price amid political 
tension in the Middle East and as investors remain cautious ahead of the UK general election on Thursday. Gold 
was quoted at USD1,288.84 an ounce compared to USD1,279.93 an ounce at the London equities close on 
Monday. 
Vodafone Group, up 0.5%. The telecoms company said it has updated its policy on advertising to introduce new 
rules stopping its advertising from appearing within outlets that are creating and sharing hate speech and fake 
news. It noted, however, it has not changed its policy on network access to the outlets in question. Vodafone 
highlighted automated advertising technologies which use algorithms to deliver digital advertising online can lead to 
"unintended and potentially harmful outcomes" in a small minority of instances. Additionally, this can result in 
generating revenue for outlets that focus on hate speech and fake news.

sold after strong demand. UBS said Nordic and Avista sold a combined 250.0 million shares at a price of 322.0 
pence per share. 
Burberry Group, down 2.8%. HSBC downgraded the fashion house to Reduce from Hold.

AO World, down 6.6%. The online electrical appliance retailer reported a slightly wider loss in its recently-ended 
financial year, and warned on a slower growth rate for the UK in the first quarter of the new year. AO World said its 
pretax loss in the year ended March 31 widened slightly to GBP7.0 million from GBP6.7 million the year before, due 
to set-up costs associated with the early operations of its business in the Netherlands and Germany. AO World said 
trading in the UK in the latter part of the year was challenging due to weaker consumer confidence following the 
Brexit vote, subsequent price inflation and a slowdown in the UK housing market, adding that those difficult 
conditions have continued into the new financial year.
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Clontarf Energy, up 112%. The Africa and South America-focused oil and gas company said it was awarded Block 
18, offshore Equatorial Guinea, in a recent bidding round. Clontarf said the block covers around 5,056 kilometres 
squared of undrilled deep-water acreage, and it will focus on large structural and or stratigraphic trap targets. Under 
the bid terms, Clontarf will take a 70% stake in production interest, and a 65% stake in oil cost recovery. An initial 
work programme will be for three years, although extendible, including seismic acquisition plus one well if drillable 
targets are identified.
MySquar, up 20%. The Myanmar-focused social media entertainment firm said its month-on-month revenue has 
been steadily increasing, helping it make significant progress towards its monetisation targets. The company said 
average daily revenue reached USD7,000 in early June, up 40% from USD5,000 in the first week of May, and 
USD5,500 for the whole of May. The majority of current daily revenue continues to be generated from gaming and 
mobile payment application developments, MySQUAR said. "We are pleased that average daily revenue continues 
to steadily increase due in part to the strong user reception of our product offerings," said Chief Executive Officer 
Eric Schaer.
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
Oilex, down 31%. The oil and gas company said it is considering whether further stimulation is warranted at the C-
70 well at the Cambay field in India, after the well returned small volumes of both oil and gas following a workover 
programme. A sustained flow has not been confirmed at the well, and it is being monitored for clean-up flow. 
However, at the C-23z well at Cambay, a workover has resulted in an observed water influx into the well bore, but 
no hydrocarbons were recovered. Oilex is currently in talks with several potential partners on its Cambay joint 
venture and added that should any change in the structure of its Cambay joint venture occur, it may restructure its 
ongoing funding commitment to Cambay.

Rio Tinto said its USD781 million cash tender offer to reduce its gross debt was oversubscribed. Rio Tinto launched 
the cash tender in May as part of an ongoing capital management plan. Back in May, the company detailed a new 
plan to reduce its debt by up to USD2.50 billion through a bond repurchase programme, following on from USD7.50 
billion worth of notes that were redeemed during 2016. On Tuesday, Rio Tinto said it will purchase USD781 million 
of securities, including USD144.2 million of 4.125% notes due 2021, USD273.9 million of 3.75% notes due 2021, 
USD231.6 million of 3.50% notes due 2022, and USD131.1 million of 2.875% notes due 2022.
----------
Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings and easyJet reported year-on-year growth in the number of customers they 
carried in May. Irish carrier Ryanair said it carried 11% more passengers in May, up to 11.8 million from 10.6 
million. Load factor also grew, by 1 percentage point, to 95% from 94%. Rival easyJet said 9.5% more passengers 
flew with it in May, up to 7.5 million from 6.9 million a year ago. Load factor, however, remained flat at 91.5%.

International Consolidated Airlines Group's chief executive said human error caused the British Airways IT systems 
crash that left tens of thousands of passengers stranded, the BBC reported. Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, 
speaking at an industry conference in Mexico on Monday said that an engineer had disconnected a power supply, 
causing a surge when it was reconnected, causing major damage. Walsh told reporters that the engineer in

question has been authorised to be in the data centre near Heathrow, but had not been authorised to "do what he

The UK Financial Reporting Council has dropped its investigation of PricewaterhouseCoopers's role in the Tesco 
accountancy scandal, the BBC reported. In a statement on Monday, the FRC said there was "not a realistic 
prospect" of an "adverse finding" against PwC approving Tesco's accounts between 2012 and 2014. PwC said in a 
statement it was pleased with FRC's conclusion. The FRC's investigation came after the supermarket overstated its 
profits for 2014 by GBP326.0 million, as Tesco said it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers.
----------
AO World reported a slightly wider loss in its recently-ended financial year, and warned on a slower growth rate for 
the UK in the first quarter of the new year. AO World said its pretax loss in the year ended March 31 widened 
slightly to GBP7.0 million from GBP6.7 million the year before, due to set-up costs associated with the early 
operations of its business in the Netherlands and Germany. Revenue, however, rose to GBP701.2 million from

currency to GBP71.5 million. AO World said trading in the UK in the latter part of the year was challenging due to 
weaker consumer confidence following the Brexit vote, subsequent price inflation and a slowdown in the UK 
housing market, adding that those difficult conditions have continued into the new financial year.

The independent directors of Shawbrook Group advised shareholders to take no action in relation to an increased 
and final offer from a consortium of Pollen Street Capital and BC Partners funds. The increased offer, being made 
through a joint bidding vehicle Marlin Bidco, is at 340 pence, valuing the specialist lender at GBP868.0 million in 
total. The stock was quoted on Tuesday at 336.20p, down 0.7%. The consortium had previously made an offer for 
Shawbrook at 330p, but this was rejected by Shawbrook, having achieved acceptances from only 45% of the 
lender's shareholders including the 39% stake held by the consortium itself.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Police named two of three men who were shot dead after vehicle and stabbing attacks at the weekend in the heart 
of London, and arrested several more people in east London who are believed to be connected to the terrorists. 
The Metropolitan Police published photographs and details of the two, saying they were from Barking in east 
London, but cautioned that "formal identification has yet to take place". They said detectives believed one of the 
men was Khuram Shazad Butt, 27, a British citizen who was born in Pakistan. The second suspected attacker was 
believed to be Rachid Redouane, 30, who had "claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan" and used a different name and

date of birth. Butt had been "known to the police and [security service] MI5" but there was "no intelligence to 
suggest that this attack was being planned".
----------
The Tory lead over Labour has been slashed by 16 points in a month, according to a new opinion poll which 
suggests the UK election race is neck and neck. The Survation poll for Good Morning Britain put the ruling Tories 
on 41.5% with Labour on 40.4%. The Conservatives had a 17-point lead with the pollster at the start of May, but 
Labour's rise reflected a campaign which more than half of those polled thought had been better than Theresa 
May's.
----------
British consumers reduced their spending as household budgets were increasingly squeezed by rising inflation, 
data published by the British Retail Consortium and KPMG showed. Like-for-like sales declined 0.4% in May from 
the previous year, when they advanced 0.5%. Sales were expected to drop 0.2%.
----------
Permanent job placements in the UK grew at the fastest pace in just over two years in April, the Report on Jobs 
compiled by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and IHS Markit showed. The number of people placed 
in permanent jobs increased notably in May and the rate of expansion was the fastest for 25 months. Temporary or 
contract staff placements also rose at a steeper pace, and recorded the strongest rate of growth since March 2015.
----------
Ireland's service sector activity maintained strong growth momentum in May, though the rate of growth eased 
slightly since April, survey data from IHS Markit showed. The seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index for 
the services sector dropped to 59.5 in May from 61.1 in April. However, any reading above 50 indicates expansion 
in the sector.
----------
Australian police are treating as "a terrorist attack" an incident that took place Monday at an apartment in a 
Melbourne suburb in which two men were killed and a woman was held hostage briefly. The hostage-taker, a 29-
year-old Australian born in Somalia, was killed by the police in the attack for which the Islamic State group claimed 
responsibility. He told reporters in Melbourne they were treating the incident as "a terror attack", but is not believed 
to be part of a wider plot.
----------
US President Donald Trump defended his executive order banning most travellers from six Muslim-majority nations 
and criticized his own administration's revisions to the policy to address legal challenges. In a series of tweets, 
Trump insisted the policy was a "travel ban", despite efforts by members of his staff to distance the White House 
from the politically charged term. "The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the 
watered down, politically correct version they submitted to [the Supreme Court]," Trump said. Trump had originally 
issued a policy that banned travellers from seven countries and halted the admission of most refugees. But after its 
implementation led to chaos at US airports and a series of legal challenges, his administration pulled the policy and 
he later signed a revised executive order. That order is now facing its own legal challenges.
----------
Former FBI director James Comey will answer questions Thursday about his dealings with Donald Trump, a month 
after being fired by the US president. Comey's highly anticipated testimony in Washington will be part of a probe 
examining whether Trump pressured Comey to end an investigation into his former national security advisor - an 
accusation that could amount to obstruction of justice and further ensnare Trump amid broader concerns about his 
campaign's dealings with Russia.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Panmure Gordon lifted its price target on Ryanair Holdings to EUR20 from EUR17, 
following "in-line" annual results released on Tuesday, with the broker saying the budget airline has a leading 
position amid consolidation in the short-haul industry. 
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.3% at EUR18.39 on Wednesday morning. The stock ended up 2.3% on Tuesday, 
recovering from an initial 4.2% loss at the open. 
Ryanair reported profit of EUR1.47 billion in its financial year ended March 31, down from EUR1.72 billion the year 
before. Excluding the prior year's exceptional items, pretax profit would have risen from EUR1.40 billion.
Revenue, meanwhile, edged up 1.5% to EUR6.65 billion from EUR6.55 billion, as the number of customers carried 
rose by 13% to 120.0 million from 106.4 million.
"We see a degree of upside to Ryanair's guidance for Summer yields down 5% (Panmure expectation 4%) given 
more upbeat comments from the likes of easyJet and Wizz Air, assuming disruption is more benign that last year, 
when demand was impacted by terrorism and the UK referendum," said Panmure analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue.
Alongside the rise in its price target, Panmure kept a Buy recommendation on the shares, with the broker's Irvine-
Fortescue saying that the low-cost airline "is in a (probably the) leading position to capitalise on increasing 
commoditisation of the short-haul market as the industry consolidates".
"Our Buy rating is predicated on cost leadership, plus margin leadership plus growth leadership, resulting in a 
structural leadership position for Ryanair," noted the analyst. 
On Wednesday, Ryanair welcomed a ruling by the Liverpool County Court upholding the company's policy that 
EU261 legal cases involving "claims chasers" must be heard in the Irish Courts.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has welcomed a ruling by the Liverpool 
County Court upholding the company's policy that EU261 legal cases involving "claims chasers" must be heard in 
the Irish Courts.
The Irish low-cost airline said an application by "claims chasing firm" Hughes Walker to have their cases involving 
the company heard by English Courts has been rejected by the Liverpool County Court at the same time as the 
general ruling. 
EU261 cases refer to the law around flight delay compensation. It was introduced in February 2005 and became 
binding law in all members of the European Union, with the aim of enforcing the rights of passengers who are 
subject to cancellations, delays, denied boarding and downgrading when flying. 
The airline said cases involving UK "claims chasing" firms are heard in the Irish courts under a jurisdiction clause 
that has formed part of its terms & conditions of travel since 2010, "solely to protect consumers and force UK 
'claims chasers' to discontinue their abusive practices of charging consumers up to 50% of their compensation 
payment". 
Ryanair argues that, if an individual UK customer makes an EU261 claim directly to the company, "as required", 
which is then rejected, then the customer is "free to pursue his/her claim in the UK courts if they so wish." 
"Ryanair calls on all customers with valid EU261 compensation claims to submit their claims directly to Ryanair and 
avoid these 'claims chaser' firms who are ripping off consumers by charging up to 50% of their compensation, by 
forcing them to sign liens and deliberately bringing them through the courts. Customers with valid claims who claim 
directly from Ryanair will receive 100% of their EU261 compensation entitlement without the deduction of these 
excessive 'claims chaser' fees," said Ryanair. 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Wins Case Against "Ambulance Chasers" Of Aviation
The airline reiterated its call for the UK Competition & Markets Authority, the organisation responsible for handling 
competition concerns, to enforce "better regulations" on "claims chasers" to "protect consumers from being ripped 
off by these self-serving firms". 
Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs went one step further and described firms such as Hughes Walker 
as the "ambulance chasers of the aviation industry" that take clients through the court process so they can "feather 
their own nests". 
"We welcome this County Court ruling upholding Ryanair's jurisdiction clause which prevents 'claims chaser' firms 
deliberately and needlessly dragging consumers through the courts so they can grab up to 50% of customer's 
compensation, for providing no useful service. As the most reliable airline in Europe, Ryanair has the most on-time 
flights and the fewest cancellations, and in the rare event of delays or cancellations, we comply fully with all EU261 
legislation," Jacobs said. 
Ryanair shares were trading up 0.1% on Wednesday at 18.45 pence, building on gains seen on Tuesday.
Ryanair had Tuesday reported a fall in annual pretax profit in the year to the end of March to EUR1.47 billion from 
EUR1.72 billion the year before, but that was due to exceptional items that, if absent, would have seen profit rise to 
EUR1.40 billion. 
Revenue, meanwhile, edged up 1.5% to EUR6.65 billion from EUR6.55 billion, as the number of customers carried 
rose by 13% to 120.0 million from 106.4 million.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday reported lower profit in its recently ended financial 
year, after the prior year benefited from exceptional gains, but revenue rose as it carried more passengers.
However, the Irish budget airline continued to warn about the "negative" effects of Brexit. 
Ryanair said pretax profit in the year ended March 31 was EUR1.47 billion, down from EUR1.72 billion the year 
before. Excluding the prior year's exceptional items, pretax profit would have risen from EUR1.40 billion.
Revenue, meanwhile, edged up 1.5% to EUR6.65 billion from EUR6.55 billion, as the number of customers carried 
rose by 13% to 120.0 million from 106.4 million.
Ryanair said its positive results came despite difficult trading conditions caused by the various terrorist attacks 
across European cities, a switch of charter capacity from North Africa, Turkey and Egypt to mainland Europe, and a 
sharp decline in sterling following the Brexit vote.
In response to those issues, Ryanair said it "improved" customer experience and "stimulated growth" with lower 
fares, in order to get more people on board.
Regarding the Brexit vote, which Ryanair publicly campaigned against, the airline warned on Tuesday that there will 
be "significant uncertainty" over flights between the UK and the EU from March 2019 onwards, until it gets clarity 
over the final terms of the UK's future trading relationship with the EU.
In the absence of such certainty, Ryanair said it will continue to pivot growth away from the UK in 2017 and 2018 in 
order to "capitalise on the many growth opportunities elsewhere in Europe".
In the year ahead, Ryanair said it expects customer traffic to rise to 130.0 million, but noted that its full-year outlook 
is "clouded" by the absence of yield visibility for the second half.
UPDATE: Ryanair Warns On Brexit, Plans To Continue Pivot Away From UK
"While forward bookings in the first half are reasonably robust (up 1% on the prior year) pricing remains soft, and 
depends on the absence of security events in Europe's cities or airports. While the first quarter will benefit from 
Easter, we have limited visibility of close-in peak summer bookings and zero second-half visibility," Ryanair said in 
a statement.
"We are cautiously guiding an 8% increase in financial 2018 net profit to a range of EUR1.40 billion to EUR1.45 
billion. Investors should be wary of the risk of negative Brexit developments, or any repeat of last year's security 
events at European cities, which could damage consumer confidence, close-in bookings, and this financial 2018 
guidance," it added.
Ryanair added that it has approved a further EUR600 million share buyback, to start this week and be completed by 
the end of October. It returned over EUR1.0 billion to shareholders in the recent financial year.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Cantor Fitzgerald took a positive stance on Ryanair Holdings, saying the Irish airline 
delivered solid results, while Liberum said its new share buyback reassures on the strength of the balance sheet.
Ryanair said pretax profit in the year ended March 31 was EUR1.47 billion, down from EUR1.72 billion the year 
before. Excluding the prior year's exceptional items, pretax profit would have risen from EUR1.40 billion.
Liberum reiterated its Buy rating on Ryanair, saying the full year results were in line with its expectations and 
highlighted that profit growth is continuing despite pressure on average fares.
The broker also kept its price target at EUR17.50. Shares were up 1.7% at EUR18.32 Tuesday. 
Ryanair also said that it has approved a further EUR600 million share buyback, to start this week and be completed 
by the end of October. It returned over EUR1.0 billion to shareholders in the recent financial year.
Liberum was positive on the share buyback, saying it "reassuring on the strength of the balance sheet and ongoing 
cash generation".  
"The persistent premium to the bulk of the European airline peer group is justified by Ryanair's sustainably superior 
margins and return on invested capital, combined with attractive cash generation," Liberum said. 
Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its Hold rating on Ryanair, saying the carrier has delivered solid full year earnings.
The broker also noted that the stock has been on a strong run, along with the rest of the airline sector. The stock is 
up 26% so far in 2017.
"Given these inline results, an unattractive valuation and cautious statements on the outlook, we expect some profit 
taking," Cantor said.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC reported on Tuesday profit attributable to 
shareholders of EUR1.32 billion, or 104.64 euro cents per share, for its financial year ended March 31, down from 
EUR1.56 billion, or 115.63 euro cents, in the prior year. 
Excluding the exceptional gain of EUR317.5 million on the sale of Ryanair's Aer Lingus shareholding to 
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA in the prior year, financial 2017 profit after tax improved 6%, while 
earnings per share increased 14%.
Operating revenue from continuing operations was EUR6.65 billion, up 1.7% from EUR6.54 billion the previous 
year. Ryanair said the combination of a 13% cut in average fares, coupled with Year 3 of its "Always Getting Better" 
programme delivered 13% traffic growth to 120 million customers, and a load factor of 94%.
Looking forward, Ryanair said, it is cautiously guiding an 8% increase in financial 2018 net profit to a range of 
EUR1.40 billion to EUR1.45 billion. It warned of the risk of negative Brexit developments, or any repeat of previous 
year's security events in European cities, which could damage consumer confidence.
Ryanair said its board has approved a further EUR600 million share buyback which will start current week and, 
subject to market conditions, be completed by the end of October.

greenback since mid-April. The UK currency was standing at USD1.2816 early Tuesday, compared to USD1.2786

LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Stocks To Give Back Gains After Long Weekend
In early UK company news, Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported profit attributable to shareholders of 
EUR1.32 billion, or 104.64 euro cents per share, for its financial year ended March 31, down from EUR1.56 billion, 
or 115.63 euro cents, in the prior year.

programme delivered 13% traffic growth to 120 million customers, and a load factor of 94%.
British Airways, part of IAG, was running around "95%" of flights to and from London's Heathrow and Gatwick 
airports on Monday following a weekend computer outage that grounded the company's aircraft at both hubs and 
caused delays worldwide.
"We are running at...just over 95% of the flights: That means...all long-haul flights in Heathrow...[and] just over 90% 
of the short-haul flights in Heathrow and all flights in Gatwick," BA chief executive Alex Cruz said in a video 
published on the company's Twitter feed.
He said that over 75,000 passengers had been affected by the weekend computer failure and that two-thirds of 
them would have reached their destinations by the end of Monday, which was a public holiday at the end of a long 
weekend in Britain.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - European stocks extended declines for a fourth consecutive 
session on Tuesday as fresh political worries surrounding Britain, Italy and Greece sapped investors' appetite for 
risk and helped spur demand for safe-haven assets.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.3% at 390.02 in late opening deals, extending losses for 
the fourth straight session.
The German DAX was down about 0.1% while France's CAC 40 index was losing as much as 0.8%.
The UK's FTSE 100 was down 0.3% as traders returned to their desks following a long holiday weekend.
Banks led losses after Deutsche Bank analysts cut their rating on regional banking stocks to "underweight". 
UniCredit, Commerzbank, Societe Generale and Barclays fell over 1% each.
International Consolidated Airlines Group lost almost 3% as British Airways grapples with a massive IT system 
failure over the weekend that led to hundreds of flights being cancelled.
Ryanair Holdings dropped 1.5%. The discount carrier said that the slump of the British currency after the Brexit vote 
will likely lead to a 5-7% decline in average ticket prices for the full financial year.
German luxury car maker BMW edged up marginally. The company has halted production of certain models this 
week because of a shortage of steering gears supplied by Robert Bosch.
In economic releases, French GDP grew 0.4% sequentially in the first quarter, slower than the 0.5% increase seen 
in the fourth quarter but a tad higher then the initial estimate of 0.3%, second estimate from the statistical office 
Insee showed.
A gauge of French consumer confidence strengthened in May to the highest level in nearly ten years, while 
consumer spending rose for the first time in three months in April.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets ended Tuesday's session with modest 
losses, extending their recent losing streak to four straight sessions.
Fresh political worries surrounding Britain, Italy and Greece sapped investors' appetite for risk, as well as mounting 
tensions between North Korea and the West.
Greece has warned that its recovery would be thrown into doubt if Brussels blocked a debt deal at the next meeting 
of euro area finance ministers. Media reports suggest that Athens may opt out of its next bailout payment if 
creditors cannot agree on debt relief.
Speculation over a possible early election in Italy intensified after rivals Matteo Renzi and Beppe Grillo edged closer 
to a deal on rewriting Italy's electoral law.
Bank stocks were under pressure after Deutsche Bank analysts cut their rating on regional banking stocks to 
"Underweight."
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.23%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 0.50%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.35%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 0.24% and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.50%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 
0.28% and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.27%.
In Frankfurt, luxury car maker BMW finished down by 0.38%. The company has halted production of certain models 
this week because of a shortage of steering gears supplied by Robert Bosch.
Deutsche Bank weakened by 1.64% and Commerzbank surrendered 0.92%.
In Paris, Credit Agricole decreased 0.90% and Societe Generale forfeited 1.43%. BNP Paribas also finished lower 
by 0.08%.
European Markets Hit By Political Uncertainty
In London, International Consolidated Airlines Group dropped 1.38% as British Airways grapples with a massive IT 
system failure over the weekend that led to hundreds of flights being canceled.
Ryanair Holdings rose 2.39%. The discount carrier said that the slump of the British currency after the Brexit vote 
will likely lead to a 5-7% decline in average ticket prices for the full financial year.
Barclays declined 1.16% and Royal Bank of Scotland lost 0.38%. Lloyds Banking Group dropped 0.86% and 
Standard Chartered surrendered 0.95%.
Eurozone economic confidence declined unexpectedly in May from a near decade high on weak services and retail 
sentiment, yet remained strong enough to signal a pick up in the growth momentum. The economic confidence 
index declined to 109.2 in May from a revised 109.7 in the previous month, survey results from the European 
Commission showed Tuesday.
The score was forecast to improve to 110 from April's initial reading of 109.6, which was the highest since August 
2007.
Germany's consumer price inflation eased more-than-expected in May to its lowest level in six months, preliminary 
data from Destatis showed Tuesday. The consumer price index rose 1.5% annually following 2% gain in April. 
Economists had forecast 1.6% inflation.
Germany's import price inflation remained stable in April, figures from Destatis showed Tuesday. Import prices 
advanced 6.1% year-on-year in April, the same pace of growth as seen in March. Economists had forecast the 
annual rate to accelerate to 6.3%.
Data showed that export prices climbed 2.6% year-on-year in April, faster than the 2.3% rise registered in March. 
Month-on-month, export prices gained 0.2% after staying flat a month ago.
French consumer confidence strengthened in May to the highest level in nearly ten years, while consumer spending 
rose for the first time in three months in April, figures from the statistical office Insee showed Tuesday. The 
consumer confidence index climbed to 102.0 in May from 100.0 in April.
Personal income and spending both increased in line with economist estimates in the month of April, according to a 
report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday.
The report said personal income climbed by 0.4% in April after rising by 0.2% in March. The increase matched 
economist estimates.
Additionally, the Commerce Department said personal spending rose by 0.4% in April after climbing by 0.3% in 
March. The spending growth also matched expectations.
US consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in May, the second consecutive monthly decline, according to a report 
from the Conference Board. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index slipped to 117.9, down from 
119.4 in April. Economists expected a reading in the neighborhood of 119.5.

Ryanair Strikes Long-Haul Flight Partnership With Spain 's Air Europa
Ryanair Strikes Long-Haul Flight Partnership With Spain's Air Europa

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday announced a new flight partnership with Spanish 
airline Air Europa Lineas Aereas SAU, which will allow Ryanair customers to book Air Europa long-haul flights on 
Ryanair's website.
Under the partnership, customers will be able to book from a choice of 20 long-haul routes from Madrid to 16 
countries in North, Central and South America.
The second phase of the partnership to be launched later this year will allow Ryanair customers to connect on to Air 
Europa long-haul flights through Madrid.
Air Europa is Spain's third-largest airline after Iberia and Vueling, both of which are owned by British Airways owner 
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.
"We continue to speak to a number of other long-haul airlines about potential connecting flight partnerships and we 
look forward to offering our 130 million customers an even greater choice and range of long-haul services in 2018," 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 1.1% at EUR17.07 on Tuesday.

EXTRA: easyJet Loss Widens But Recruits Pilots Amid Strong Demand

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airline easyJet PLC on Tuesday reported a much wider pretax loss in the first 
half of its financial year, but revenue rose as it carried more passengers and it said it will meet market expectations 
for the full year as consumer demand remains strong.
Shares in easyJet were trading down 6.4% at 1,226.60 pence on Tuesday, the worst performer in the FTSE 100.
easyJet's pretax loss in the six months ended March 31 widened to GBP236.0 million from GBP18.0 million a year 
before. This winter period is typically the weakest for airlines, with losses made up in the summer, easyJet's second 
half. 
The airline said it faced a GBP45 million hit due to the later timing of Easter this year, which fell into the second half 
of its financial year, and an GBP82 million foreign exchange hit, which was worse than its prior expectation of 
GBP75 million.
Profit was also suffered from a decline in revenue per seat of 4.9% to GBP48.80. This reflected the later timing of 
Easter, but also overall market capacity growth as airlines, such as easyJet and Ryanair Holdings PLC, drive 
demand with more flights at lower prices. 
easyJet's capacity increased by 8.4% in the first half and is expected to grow by the same amount in the second 
half.
Revenue per seat was also hit by "increased levels of disruption" resulting from strikes, severe weather and other 
airport issues leading to the cancellation or severe delay of 3,302 flights.
Total revenue, however, rose to GBP1.83 billion in the first half from GBP1.78 billion, as easyJet carried a record 
33.8 million passengers, up from 31.0 million the year before, and load factor increased to a record 90.2% from 
89.7%. Load factor bounced back in the full half-year from the first quarter when it slipped by 0.3 percentage point 
year-on-year to 90.0%.
EXTRA: easyJet Loss Widens But Recruits Pilots Amid Strong Demand
Meanwhile, cost per seat at constant currency was flat at GBP38.54, which easyJet said reflected "strong cost 
control despite high levels of disruption".
Looking forward, easyJet said forward bookings for the third quarter are ahead year-on-year, at 77%, while 
continuing to expect revenue per seat to decline by low single digits in the third quarter.
Cost per seat is expected to increase by around 1% at constant currency for the full year, which easyJet said is 
better than previously expected.
"Our bookings for the summer are ahead of last year showing that demand to fly remains strong and reflects 
growing evidence that consumers are prioritising expenditure on flights and holidays above other non-essential 
items," Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said in a statement.
"Looking ahead, we are seeing an improving revenue per seat trend as well as the continued reduction of 
competitor capacity growth. Cost performance for the full year will continue to be strong. easyJet is delivering on its 
strategy of purposeful investment in securing and building strong positions at Europe's leading airports which is 
driving competitive advantage with sustainable returns. As a result our expectations for the full year are in line with 
current consensus market expectations," she added.
The airline noted that it remains on track to secure a European Air Operator Certificate by the summer, so that it 
can secure the flying rights of its network within the European Union following Brexit.
easyJet added that it has agreed to purchase 30 A321 NEO aircraft under its existing agreement with Airbus, with 
the first arriving in summer 2018. This is a conversion of 30 existing A320 NEO orders and will be neutral to current 
fleet capital expenditure commitments, it said.
"These new aircraft will help us deliver our strategy of securing and growing our number one positions at Europe's 
leading airports, which are generally slot constrained, while reducing our cost per seat. This means we will be able 
to offer low fares to more people on Europe's most popular business and leisure routes," McCall said.
"As importantly, the A321 NEOs will also help us to mitigate our environmental impact by reducing our passengers' 
carbon footprint as well as our impact on the communities around the airports we serve," she added.
easyJet also announced a recruitment campaign under which it will recruit 450 new pilots in June. The campaign 
will be the largest recruitment drive in the airline's history.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it has appointed Stan McCarthy, the outgoing

as chief executive of Kerry Group he will, I believe, be a significant and valuable addition to our board. I expect Stan 
to join the board at the end of May, and he will put himself forward for approval by shareholders at our September

Ryanair shares were trading down 0.5% early Tuesday at EUR16.90.

Ryanair Pursues EUR15 Million "Double Tax" Refund In France
Ryanair Pursues EUR15 Million "Double Tax" Refund In France

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it will pursue a refund of the 
EUR15 million, plus interest, it said it has paid in "double taxes" in France, following a ruling by the European Court 
of Justice upholding European Union rules on social insurance payments for international transport workers.
Ryanair said it "welcomes" the decision by the ECJ in the 'A Rosa' case, which has determined that A1 certificates 
issued by one EU member state confirming the social insurance status of international transport workers must be 
accepted by all other EU member states.
To date, France has refused to accept the A1 certificates, meaning Ryanair has paid EUR10 million in "double 
taxes" to the French state between 2006 and 2010, it said.
"This ECJ ruling confirms that the French social insurance authorities have acted unlawfully over the past 10 years 
by double charging Ryanair, and its people, who were based temporarily in Marseille, but who had already fully paid 
their social insurance in Ireland in accordance with EU regulations," Ryanair said.
The 'A Rosa' ruling also renders null and void an attempt by the French state in 2017 to pursue Ryanair for social 
insurance payments for its pilots and cabin crew who were operating on temporary summer schedules from 
Marseille between 2011 and 2014.
According to Ryanair, the French authorities ordered it to "double pay" EUR5 million of social insurance taxes which 
it has already paid in Ireland.
"Ryanair's lawyers will be calling on the Marseille investigating magistrate to abandon this investigation which flies 
in the face of EU social insurance rules, and this ECJ ruling in the A Rosa case," Ryanair said.
In addition, a similar situation is occurring in Italy, Ryanair said, where the Italian authorities are pursuing several 
claims from 2006 to 2011 for payment of Italian social insurance contributions which have already been paid in 
Ireland.
Ryanair Pursues EUR15 Million "Double Tax" Refund In France
"Ryanair's lawyers will be writing to the Italian authorities to withdraw these claims as they now have no prospect of 
success given the clear ruling of the European Courts," the airline said.
Shares in Ryanair were trading flat at EUR15.66 on Thursday.

Ryanair Urges Certainty To Secure Future Of Some Flights After Brexit

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has warned flights between the UK and the European Union 
may be suspended even if an aviation deal is reached in Brexit negotiations.
The Dublin-based carrier claimed a delay in such an agreement being ratified by EU nations could result in flights 
being halted for several months.
The single market for aviation, created in the 1990s, means there are no commercial restrictions for airlines flying 
within the EU.
But a fresh deal must be secured if the UK's airline routes to the EU can continue after Brexit, which is scheduled to 
take place by March 2019.
"We're looking at a scenario whereby today you can fly back and forth between the UK and
Europe, tomorrow you can't. Whether that is for a number of days, a number of weeks, a number of months, 
nobody knows at this point in time," said Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan. 
"But when you're dealing with a block of 27 countries that have to ratify something that's been agreed at the centre, 
we all know that politics moves slowly," he added.
An "even worse scenario" would be for no agreement to be reached at all, he told a press conference in central 
London, before adding that "seems highly unlikely".
Airlines want aviation to be prioritised during the Brexit negotiations as flights are scheduled more than one year in 
advance.
"The clock is ticking down all the time," Sorahan warned.
Ryanair Urges Certainty To Secure Future Of Some Flights After Brexit
"Nobody really knows where this is going. We need somebody to take control of the process and say 'this is what's 
going to happen, this is what we're going to do'. We need Prime Minister [Theresa] May to say 'we will absolutely 
agree to the free movement of people, we will absolutely agree to the rulings of the European Court of Justice," he 
said.
"We need that level of certainty so that ourselves and other airlines can make decisions and load flights for summer 
2019 this time next year," the CFO added.
As an EU-based company, Ryanair expects it will need to apply for a UK operating licence after Brexit to continue 
domestic flights in the country, such as Belfast to London Gatwick and Glasgow to London Stansted.
But Sorahan claimed the airline may prefer to cut the services completely.
"It's a very small part of our business. It's less than 2% of our capacity. The decision may be made not to go for an 
air operator certificate and just to abandon domestic UK flying. It's not something that we particularly want to do but 
it's something that could happen," he said.
Luton-based carrier easyJet PLC has said it will announce its application for an EU AOC shortly to allow it to secure 
flying rights for the 30% of its routes that do not touch the UK. This will cost the airline an estimated GBP10 million.
A UK government spokeswoman said: "Aviation is absolutely crucial to the UK's economy and we are committed to 
getting the right deal for Britain. We will work closely with the international aviation community to ensure that this 
global industry continues to be a major success story
for the UK economy."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday detailed its customer experience improvement plan, 
which forms year four of its 'Always Getting Better' programme.
New initiatives to be rolled out over the year including "even lower airfares and more of them", offering connecting 
flights on its network that then go on to other airlines, and new bases in Frankfurt Main and Naples with improved 
schedules. 
"The success of the 'Always Getting Better' programme over the past three years has been reflected in ever 
increasing load factors and record passenger numbers, which has seen our traffic grow by over 50%," said Chief 
Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs in a statement.
"As we expand the Ryanair route network, customers will for the first time be able to book connecting Ryanair 
flights on the Ryanair.com website, with a feeder flight service with other airlines following later this year," Jacobs 
added. 
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.5% at 15.02 pence Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airline easyJet PLC on Thursday reported a year-on-year rise in passengers 
and load factor in March.
Passengers, as measured by the number of earned seats flown, rose 11% to 6.3 million in March compared to 5.7 
million the year before. Meanwhile, load factor, which represents the number of passengers as a proportion of 
number of seats available, was 92.7%, up 1.4 percentage points from 91.3%.
On a rolling twelve month basis, passengers were up 7.3% to 75.9 million from 70.8 million, and load factor was up 
0.2 percentage point to 91.7% from 91.5%.
This followed rises in passenger traffic and capacity reported on Wednesday by International Consolidated Airlines 
Group PLC, which owns British Airways, Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, and Irish airline Aer Lingus. On 
Tuesday, easyJet's budget airline peers Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC both also reported a rise 
in passenger numbers year-on-year in March.

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - After showing a strong move to the upside early in the session, stocks remain 
mostly positive in mid-day trading on Wednesday. With the upward move on the day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 
reached a new record intraday high.
Currently, the major averages remain firmly positive but off their best levels of the day. The Dow is up 142.66 points 
or 0.7% at 20,831.90, the Nasdaq is up 27.34 points or 0.5% at 5,925.94 and the S&P 500 is up 13.23 points or 
0.6% at 2,373.39.
The strength on Wall Street comes following the release of a report from payroll processor ADP showing much 
stronger than expected private sector job growth in the month of March.
ADP said private sector employment soared by 263,000 jobs in March compared to economist estimates for an 
increase of about 187,000 jobs.
However, the report also said the jump in employment in February was downwardly revised to 245,000 jobs from 
the previously reported 298,000 jobs.
"Job growth is off to a strong start in 2017," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "The gains are 
broad based but most notable in the goods producing side of the economy including construction, manufacturing 
and mining."
The release of the report from ADP comes two days before the release of the Labor Department's more closely 
watched monthly jobs report, which includes both public and private sector jobs.
The Labor Department report is expected to show an increase of about 180,000 jobs in March, while the 
unemployment rate is expected to hold at 4.7%.
Meanwhile, traders have largely shrugged off a separate report from the Institute for Supply Management showing 
that service sector growth slowed by more than expected in March.
Stocks Remain Mostly Positive In Mid-Day Trading - US Commentary
The ISM said its non-manufacturing index dropped to 55.2 in March from 57.6 in February, although a reading 
above 50 indicates continued growth in the service sector. Economists had expected the index to edged down to 
57.0.
The bigger than expected pullback by the index came after it reached its highest level since October of 2015 in the 
previous month.
Later in the day, trading may be impacted by reaction to the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary 
policy meeting.
The Fed decided to raise interest rates by a quarter point at the meeting in mid-March, and traders are likely to 
analyze the minutes for clues about future rate hikes.
Sector News
Despite the upward move by the broader markets, many of the major sectors continue to show only modest moves 
on the day.
Airline stocks have shown a strong move to the upside, however, with the NYSE Arca Airline Index climbing by 
1.3%. Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) and American Airlines (AAL) are turning in two of the sector's best performances.
Significant strength also remains visible among oil service stocks, although the Philadelphia Oil Service Index has 
pulled back well off its highs. After reaching its best intraday level in a month, the index is up by 1.3%.
The strength among oil service stocks comes as the price of crude oil has pulled back well off its best levels but is 
currently modestly higher.
Crude oil for May delivery is up USD0.13 at USD51.16 a barrel after climbing as high as USD51.88 a barrel. The 
price of oil pulled back following the release of a report showing an unexpected weekly increase in crude oil 
inventories.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday called on the UK government to 
put aviation "at the forefront" of its negotiations with the European Union and provide a "coherent post-Brexit plan", 
or risk temporarily leaving the UK without any flights to or from Europe once it exits the EU.
Ryanair noted that, with the UK set to leave Europe's 'open skies' system, the UK government will either have to 
negotiate a bilateral agreement with the EU to allow flights to and from Europe to continue, or else revert to 
"historical" rules set by the World Trade Organisation. 
As WTO rules do not cover aviation, this would raise "the distinct possibility" of no flights between Europe and the 
UK "for a period" from March 2019 - when Britain is set to leave the EU - in the absence of a bilateral deal, Ryanair 
said.
The Irish low-cost airline pointed out that it has already pivoted growth away from the UK to other EU airports since 
the Brexit vote, basing no additional aircraft at its 19 UK airports in 2017 and cutting its growth rate to just 6% this 
year from 15%.
"Some nine months on from the Brexit referendum, we are no closer to knowing what effect it will have on aviation. 
It's become worrying that the UK government seems to have no plan B to maintain Britain's liberalised air links with 
Europe, in the absence of remaining in the 'open skies' regime," Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a 
statement.
Ryanair added that as airlines plan their flights 12 months in advance, this means there are just 12 months to go 
until they finalise their summer 2019 schedules, which could see "deep cuts" to flights both to, from and within the 
UK.
It urged the UK government to "immediately outline a strategy" to maintain low fare air travel between the UK and 
EU from March 2019.
Ryanair Urges UK Government To Make Aviation Priority Of Brexit Talks
"The UK government must respond to the airlines and our customers, and put aviation at the top of its agenda when 
it negotiates its Brexit deal with Brussels. Britain's airlines, airports and holidaymakers need a real and early 
solution for aviation, or risk Britain being cut off from Europe in March 2019," CMO Jacobs said.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 0.4% at EUR14.35 on Wednesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The European Union has warned airlines including easyJet and Ryanair that they will 
need to relocate their headquarters or sell off shares to European nationals if they want to continue flying routes 
within continental Europe after Brexit, the Guardian reported on Wednesday. 
Shares in easyJet and Ryanair were down 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively, on Wednesday afternoon. International 
Consolidated Airlines Group was down 2.3%.
The Guardian said executives at major carriers have been reminded during recent private meetings with officials 
that to continue to operate on routes across the continent they must have a significant base on EU territory and that 
a majority of their capital shares must be EU-owned.
Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to trigger Article 50 on March 29, officially starting the two-year period of 
Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK.

BERLIN (Alliance News) - A strike by ground crew workers at Berlin's two commercial airports has been extended 
until early Wednesday, the Verdi union announced.
The initial strike over pay by around 2,000 workers had been called until early Tuesday.
The walkout began at 0300 GMT on Monday and affects both of the German capital's airports - Schoenefeld in the 
south-east and Tegel in the north-west.
It will now last until around 0400 GMT on Wednesday.
At Tegel, 465 flights are expected to stay grounded on Monday while at Schoenefeld, 195 flights are due to be 
cancelled, a spokesman for the two airports said.
"We are asking all passengers to check with their airline about the status of their flight before they start their trip," a 
statement on a website for the airports said.
Passengers due to land in Berlin have also been affected.
Airlines are re-routing some flights to the eastern German cities of Dresden and Leipzig, with Easyjet landing at the 
former and Ryanair the latter. Passengers are then being bussed to Berlin, two hours away.
Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller, who was due to make a three-day trip to Moscow, also had his journey interrupted. 
A replacement flight for the mayor was organized from Dresden airport.
An earlier strike on Friday caused hundreds of flight cancellations in Berlin.
"The Verdi strikes mean our capital Berlin has been completely cut off to air travel for days. Not only are the airports 
being damaged but also the image of Germany," said airport association chief Ralph Beisel.
UPDATE: Berlin Airport Strikes Extended Until Early Wednesday
Trade union Verdi is pushing for a pay increase and better working hours for its members, arguing that their 
workload is increasing given the growing number of passengers at Berlin's ageing airports and a greater focus on 
security.
Strike leader Enrico Ruemker said he was waiting for a new offer from management.
A new combined airport for Berlin near Schoenefeld is expected to open in 2019 after years of delays and 
wrangling.

BERLIN (Alliance News) - The strike of ground staff at two major airports in Berlin resulted in the cancellation of 
more than 660 flights on Monday.
465 flights were cancelled at Berlin Tegel in the north, while 195 were grounded at Berlin Shonefeld in the south, 
resulting in a total halt of the flights services at the two airports. Air Berlin, easyJet, Lufthansa, Germanwings and 
Ryanair are the most affected airlines.
The workers are demanding a pay hike to EUR12 per hour from the current wages of EUR11 per hour. The 25-hour 
strike will continue until 0500 on 15 March. More than 2,000 ground staff are participating in the strike.
The airport management offered an increase of 10 centS per hour for next four years, but later offered 8% increase 
for the next three years.
Tigel airport is around eight kilometer away from the city of Berlin and handles more than 21 million passengers an 
year,while Berlin Shonefeld, situated in the southeast of Berlin, handles more nearly 12 million passengers per 
year.
The airports said there could be action restriction in air traffic even after the strike.

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - Stocks turned in a relatively lackluster performance during trading on Tuesday 
before eventually ending the session modestly lower. With the drop on the day, the major averages added to the 
losses posted in the previous session.
The major averages climbed off their worst levels going into the close but remained stuck in the red. The Dow 
edged down 29.58 points or 0.1% to 20,924.76, the Nasdaq dipped 15.25 points or 0.3% to 5,833.93 and the S&P 
500 fell 6.92 points or 0.3% to 2,368.39.
The lower close on Wall Street was partly due to profit taking, as traders continued to cash in the recent strength in 
the markets.
The major averages have closed lower in three out of the past four sessions after rallying to new record highs last 
Wednesday.
Concerns about the outlook for interest rates also weighed on the markets amid rising expectations for an increase 
in rates at next week's Federal Reserve meeting.
CME Group's FedWatch tool is indicating an 84.1% probability of a quarter-point rate hike by the central bank.
Nonetheless, trading activity was somewhat subdued as traders look ahead to the Labor Department's closely 
watched monthly jobs report on Friday.
In economic news, a report released by the Commerce Department showed that the US trade deficit widened in line 
with economist estimates in the month of January.
The report said the trade deficit widened to USD48.5 billion in January from USD44.3 billion in December, matching 
expectations.
The trade deficit reported for January was the widest since the deficit reached USD50.2 billion in March of 2012.
Stocks Close Modestly Lower For Second Straight Day - US Commentary
Sector News
Airline stocks showed a significant move to the downside on the day, dragging the NYSE Arca Airline Index down 
by 1.7%. With the drop, the index fell to a three-month closing low.
Allegiant Travel (ALGT), Hawaiian Holdings (HA), and Ryanair (RYAAY) turned in some of the airline sector's worst 
performances on the day.
Significant weakness was also visible among steel stocks, as reflected by the 1.7% loss posted by the NYSE Arca 
Steel Index. The index fell to its lowest closing level in a month.
Biotechnology stocks also came under pressure after President Donald Trump pledged to introduce a new system 
to increase competition in the drug industry and bring prices down.
Telecom, oil service, and railroad stocks also showed notable moves to the downside on the day, moving lower 
along with most of the other major sectors.
Other Markets
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in another mixed performance on Tuesday. 
Japan's Nikkei 225 Index edged down by 0.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose by 0.4%.
The major European markets also finished the day mixed. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1%, the 
UK's FTSE 100 Index dipped by 0.2% and the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.4%.
In the bond market, treasuries moved modestly lower after ending the previous session roughly flat. As a result, the 
yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, rose by 1.7 basis points to 2.511%.
Looking Ahead
Reports on private sector employment and labor productivity may attract some attention on Wednesday, although 
trading activity is likely to remain somewhat subdued ahead of the jobs report due Friday.
On the earnings front, H&R Block (HRB) and Urban Outfitters (URBN) are among the companies releasing their 
quarterly results after the close of today's trading.
Bob Evans (BOBE), Ciena (CIEN), and Hovnanian (HOV) are also due to report their results before the start of 
trading on Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said it is now expecting full year traffic to hit 120.0 
million customers, thanks to slightly higher than expected load factors in its fourth quarter.
The European airline said traffic grew 10% year-on-year in February to 8.2 million customers from 7.4 million 
customers, and load factor rose two percentage points to 95%.
Ryanair said the rise in both traffic and load factor came on the back of lower fares and the "continuing success" of 
its 'Always Getting Better' customer experience programme, in light of which it expects a 13% annual rise in traffic 
over the year to end March 31.
Rolling annual traffic to February grew 14% to 119.1 million customers, the group said.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.4% at EUR14.31 on Friday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary has warned there is a 
remote chance of all flights between the UK and Europe being suspended in March 2019 if the UK government opts 
for a "cliff-edge" Brexit.
The businessman said the current open skies arrangement hinges on recognising the jurisdiction of the European 
Court of Justice, which Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain would no longer be subject to.
O'Leary believes it will take more than the two-year time frame from triggering Article 50 to put agreements in place 
with European Union (EU) nations.
He said: "In the airline industry we could be heading for a very difficult divorce with Europe. There is a possibility, 
unlikely, but nevertheless a possibility that there may be no flights between the UK and Europe in March 2019 if the 
UK walks off this cliff that they seem determined to walk off."
The airline head said he was switching growth plans away from the UK and would not create any more pilot or 
cabin crew posts, or increase the amount of planes there due to Brexit uncertainty.
He said new routes announced in Scotland on Thursday would use planes based elsewhere in Europe and would 
move to other European countries in the event of a hard Brexit.
O'Leary accused the UK government of being clueless over Brexit and hoped that the UK would stay in the EU.
He said: "Brexit - no exit plan by the UK government. I don't think they have a clue what they are engaged in. I've 
had a number of meetings in London in recent weeks where they are going to do a great deal for Britain, and then I 
got to Frankfurt and
Brussels and Paris where they are determined to do Britain down, and I fear they will."
Ryanair Chief Warns Of Flight Suspension Risk Amid "Cliff-Edge" Brexit
"We have to recognise the will of the the people, they did vote in a referendum, however they were fundamentally 
misled into believing they could leave Europe and nothing would change. Everything is going to change, and 
probably for the worse," O'Leary said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London opened slightly lower on Thursday, giving back some of the US-
driven gains made on Wednesday, with airline stocks in favour and oil producers falling after amid soft crude prices. 
The FTSE 100 index was down 0.2%, or 14.40 points, at 7,288.01. The FTSE 250 index was down 0.1% at 
18,810.16, but the AIM All-Share was up 0.1% at 907.55.
Stocks going ex-dividend also were dragging on London's indices, with blue-chips Imperial Brands  down 1.3% and 
AstraZeneza down 2.7%, among others. 
Cobham was the worst FTSE 250 performer after announcing a further profit warning for 2016.
The BATS UK 100 index was down 0.3% at 12,337.13, and the BATS 250 was 0.1% lower at 17,112.36, but the

The US Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that US stockpiles rose 9.5 million barrels in the 
week ended on February 10, confirming an industry report late Tuesday. Though this was below the 13.8 million 
barrels increase reported for the previous week, the EIA said total US inventories are at an all-time peak of 518.12 
million barrels, while gasoline stocks also touched a record.
Oil prices have remained on the back foot so far this week, with Brent oil having reached USD56.79 on Monday but

Royal Dutch Shell 'A' shares were down 1.1%, while BP was down 0.8%.
Airline stocks were the main gainers in the FTSE 100, with British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines 
Group up 2.6% and easyJet up 1.4%. FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air Holdings was up 1.3%. Meanwhile, Ryanair 
Holdings was up 0.9%.

Airline stocks received a boost after Air France-KLM reported higher net profit in its fourth quarter, rising to EUR362 
million from EUR276 million in the prior year. Paris-listed Air France-KLM shares were 7.8%. 
Wizz Air also announced the opening of a new base at Luton airport, north of London.
The CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were both flat.  
In Asia on Thursday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.5%, retreating from a strong 1.0% gain on 
Wednesday. In China, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong ended 0.5% 
higher. 
In a thin economic calendar on Thursday, US initial and continuing jobless claims are at 1330 GMT, as is the 
Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey.
But before that, the European Central Bank releases at 1230 GMT the accounts of its last monetary policy meeting 
held on January 19.
"The ECB minutes will likely show strong support for the need for a sustained adjustment of inflation. We will also 
be looking for further information on the implementation of purchases of bonds trading below the deposit rate," says 
Societe Generale analyst Michala Marcussen.
ECB President Mario Draghi struck a largely dovish tone in his press conference after the January meeting, as he 
said he is unconvinced by the recent rise in inflation.
Preliminary data from Eurostat released last month after the ECB meeting showed that eurozone inflation 
accelerated strongly in January, led by energy prices, while the core figure held steady. The eurozone consumer 
price index rose 1.8% year-on-year following 1.1% increase in December. Core inflation, which excludes energy, 
food, alcohol and tobacco prices, was 0.9% in January, unchanged from December.
In January, the ECB left its key interest rates unchanged and retained its asset purchases of EUR80 billion a month 
till March. Thereafter, asset purchases will be reduced to EUR60 billion a month until December 2017. Asset 
purchases can be extended beyond December if necessary, the ECB added.
Elsewhere in London, Lancashire Holdings was up 7.1% despite saying its profit and premiums written dropped in 
2016 amid pressure on prices. The specialist insurer reported a pretax profit of USD150.4 million for 2016, down 
12% from USD171.7 million the prior year. 
Aldermore Group and Shawbrook were up 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, after Panmure Gordon initiated both 
challenger banks with a Buy recommendation. 
Cobham was down 21%. The firm announced a further profit warning for 2016 and said meeting expectations in 
2017 will be challenging, as it booked a series of new writedowns following a review of the business.
Cobham had already in January warned on its 2016 results, its third downgrade for the year, and it added a fourth 
warning on Thursday. The defence and aerospace engineer said its underlying trading profit will be around 
GBP225.0 million, compared to the GBP245.0 million to which it had already cut its guidance back in January.
In addition, Cobham said it feels delivering a performance in 2017 in line with 2016 may prove "challenging". It said 
the woes it has suffered in 2016 have been caused by a number of operational issues across the business. While 
measures are being taken to remedy these problems, they are at an early stage and won't provide an immediate 
improvement.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it has launched a new 
winter 2017 schedule for Scotland including 15 new routes.
Ryanair said it will launch 13 new routes from Edinburgh under the plans. These will be to Baden, Budapest, 
Carcassonne, Eindhoven, Hamburg, Katowice, Nantes, Prague, Szczecin, Toulouse, Venice, Valencia and 
Wroclaw.
In addition, it will launch two new routes from Glasgow to Krakow and Madrid.
Overall, the new routes will increase Ryanair's capacity from the two airports by 20%.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, launching the new routes in Edinburgh, said the company has record 
booking levels for its summer schedule in Scotland.
O'Leary also called on the Scottish government to scrap air passenger duty, which he said would allow Ryanair to 
"base more aircraft in Scotland, add even more new routes and and create thousands of additional jobs".
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.4% to EUR14.25 on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings' ancillary business is undervalued by the market, said Deutsche 
Bank, as it upgraded its rating for the Irish airline to Buy from Hold. 
Deutsche analysts said Ryanair's business model is significantly more feared to ancillary revenues than the market 
realise, and the company is making good progress in in improving profitability. 
The bank estimates ancillary revenues over the next three years to reach between EUR2.45 billion to EUR2.75 
billion. At a "conservative" margin estimate of 60%, this would deliver net operating profit after tax of EUR1.35 
billion to EUR1.45 billion. Estimated at an 80% margin, NOPAT rises to between EUR1.80 billion and EUR1.95 
billion. 
"These NOPAT forecasts compare to March-17 group net income forecasts of around EUR1.32 billion. To put it 
another way, on our estimates in three year's time Ryanair's ancillary NOPAT alone should be at least equivalent to 
its total (ancillary + average fare) net income today," the German bank said. 
The analysts added that the quality of earnings is much better, given the high margins relative to average fares. 
"We believe properly cultivated ancillary revenues are more sticky and stable than average fares," Deutsche said. 
"As such, should the Ryanair ancillary machine continue apace, we see its competitive position in the market as 
being reinforced."
Alongside its rating upgrade, the bank lifted its price target for Ryanair to EUR17.60 from EUR15.00.
The stock traded up 1.3% at EUR14.38 at midday on Monday.

Karlsruhe, GERMANY (Alliance News) - A decade-long dispute between air carriers Ryanair PLC and Air Berlin 
PLC could come to an end soon - but still too late - after a German court on Thursday referred the case to another 
court for a final decision.
Air Berlin has been fighting for years to get the German city of Luebeck to disclose alleged advantages given to its 
competitor, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, in the hope that Ryanair would then have to pay back the money.
Since Air Berlin originally brought the case against Ryanair years ago, the business environment has changed, with 
the Irish carrier stopping its flights to and from Luebeck.
After the airport - code LBC - declared bankruptcy twice, scheduled passenger flights are no longer conducted at all 
in the northern German city.
Germany's Federal Court of Justice pushed the ruling on to a state court in Kiel on Thursday, following a decision 
made by the European Commission this week on a state aid case from 2007 that is relevant for the Luebeck case.
The commission in Brussels said on Tuesday that certain agreements with Ryanair do not constitute state aid.
The case had been pushed around between German courts and the Court of Justice of the EU in Luxembourg, 
while the judicial bodies were waiting on the Brussels decision.
Ryanair shares were up 2.6% to EUR14.32 per share on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings on Monday gave a cautious outlook for the final months of its financial 
year, but Barclays and Liberum believe the Irish budget airline will still manage to outperform its peers. 
Ryanair said it still expects full-year profit after tax to be EUR1.30 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but said this guidance is 
heavily dependent on no unforeseen "security events" taking place in the final months of its financial year, ending 
March 31.
For the third quarter to the end of December, Ryanair said revenue edged up only 1.0% year-on-year to EUR1.35 
billion from EUR1.33 billion, and profit after tax declined to EUR95.0 million from EUR103.0 million a year before. 
This was caused by average fares falling 17% year-on-year in the quarter, which was partially offset by a 12% 
decline in average unit costs.
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said this led to a squeeze in margins, but expects Ryanair to be able to deal with this 
better than other airlines, as the company has the highest margins in the industry.
"Other airlines are unlikely to be quite so relaxed, given narrower margins to start off with and better hedging having 
seen more fuel savings taken last year, in some cases," the analyst said. 
Liberum trimmed its forecasts to reflect Ryanair's guidance for fuel costs but believes the company remains well 
positioned to continue delivering profitable growth, strong return on capital and cash generation.
The broker maintained its Buy rating and EUR16.00 price target. 
In its statement on Monday, Ryanair added that, looking to its 2018 financial year, pricing will continue to be 
"challenging" in a very competitive budget carrier market, but it intends to continue increasing capacity and 
benefiting from lower unit costs.
"We understand why Ryanair wants to remain cautious on the yield outlook, but there are logical reasons to 
assume pricing considerably improves from summer 2017," said Barclays analyst Oliver Sleath. 
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Will Deal With Margin Squeeze Better Than Peers
The analyst noted easier comparatives for Ryanair in 2018, given the Easter period will overlap the Brussels 
attacks. Barclays forecasts average fares to fall 3.5% through 2018 versus consensus which forecasts a 6.0% 
decline. 
Sleath added that Ryanair offers the lowest cost base, the strongest balance sheet, highest margins and strongest 
cash returns in the European airline sector and is well equipped to win market share as competitors feel pressure. 
Barclays kept its Overweight rating and EUR17.50 price target. 
Ryanair traded down 0.8% at midday Tuesday to EUR14.04 per share.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday maintained its full-year guidance but with a very 
cautious outlook for the final months of its financial year, as the Irish budget airline reported a decline in profit for its 
third quarter.
Ryanair said it still expects full-year profit after tax to be EUR1.30 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but said this guidance is 
heavily dependent on no unforeseen "security events" taking place in the final months of its financial year, ending 
March 31.
The airline added that, looking to its 2018 financial year, pricing will continue to be "challenging" in a very 
competitive budget carrier market, but it intends to continue increasing capacity and benefiting from lower unit 
costs.
Ryanair, a vocal proponent of the UK remaining in the European Union, also said there remains "significant 
uncertainty" about what a so-called 'hard' Brexit would entail. This uncertainty, it said, will continue to present a 
challenge for its business in the final months of its current financial year and into financial 2018.
As such, Ryanair said that while there may be opportunities to expand its presence at UK airports, it anticipates 
growing at a slower pace than previously expected in the UK and will continue to switch capacity growth to other 
key European markets.
For the third quarter to the end of December, Ryanair reported growth in customers carried of 16% year-on-year to 
28.8 million from 24.9 million, while its load factor for the quarter rose two percentage points to 95%.
Revenue, however, edged up only 1.0% year-on-year to EUR1.35 billion from EUR1.33 billion, and profit after tax 
declined to EUR95.0 million from EUR103.0 million a year before. This was caused by average fares falling 17% 
year-on-year in the quarter, which was partially offset by a 12% decline in average unit costs.
Ryanair noted that it returned EUR311.0 million to shareholders in the third quarter, as part of its ongoing 
EUR550.0 million share buyback.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Cautious On Outlook As Third-Quarter Profit Declines
"As previously guided, our fares this winter have fallen sharply as Ryanair continues to grow traffic and load factors 
strongly in many European markets. These falling yields were exacerbated by the sharp decline in sterling following 
the Brexit vote," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair's third-quarter profit after tax missed consensus expectations, but Davy 
Research and Cantor Fitzgerald remained positive on the Irish budget airline despite it issuing a very cautious 
outlook for the final months of its financial year.
Ryanair's third-quarter profit after tax declined to EUR95.0 million from EUR103.0 million a year before, missing 
consensus estimates of EUR99.0 million and Davy's own expectations of EUR103.5 million. 
"We are likely to make a modest, low-single-digit, downward adjustment to net income for financial years 2017 and 
2018, reflecting the weaker third-quarter yields and rising fuel prices," said Davy analyst Stephen Furlong. Ryanair's 
is scheduled to release full-year results to end March on May 30.
Ryanair said it still expects full-year profit after tax to be EUR1.30 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but said this guidance is 
heavily dependent on no unforeseen "security events" taking place in the final months of its 2016 financial year.
For the third quarter to the end of December, Ryanair reported growth in customers carried of 16% year-on-year to 
28.8 million from 24.9 million, while its load factor for the quarter rose two percentage points to 95%.
Revenue, however, edged up only 1.0% year-on-year to EUR1.35 billion from EUR1.33 billion. This was caused by 
average fares falling 17% year-on-year in the quarter, which was partially offset by a 12% decline in average unit 
costs.
Davy retained an Outperform recommendation on Ryanair shares.
Cantor analyst Robin Byde also highlighted that "the yield environment remains weak", noting that revenue of 
EUR1.35 billion was slightly below consensus of EUR1.36 billion.
However, Byde said the stock "is not expensive", with Cantor keeping a Hold recommendation. The broker put its 
EUR13.50 price target under review.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London had made a fairly lacklustre start to the week by midday on Monday, 
with Randgold Resources and other miners helping the FTSE 100 index to slim gains. 
The blue-chip index was up 0.2%, or 11.96 points, at 7,200.26. The FTSE 250 was flat at 18,407.49, and the AIM 
All-Share was up 0.2% at 895.67.
The BATS UK 100 index was up 0.1% at 12,172.77, the BATS 250 was down 0.1% at 16,733.75, and the BATS 
Small Companies was up 0.2% at 10,875.93. 
In Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.1% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt down 0.4%.
Before the New York open, futures indicated the DJIA, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices all flat. 
Randgold Resources led gainers in the FTSE 100, up 4.7%. The African miner raised its dividend for 2016 by more 
than half after a strong financial performance during the year and vowed to keep a hefty cash balance for new 
projects while maintaining future payouts.
Gold production in 2016 was 1.25 million ounces, the very bottom of Randgold's 1.25 million to 1.30 million ounce 
target range, rising from 1.21 million ounces in 2015. Gold sales rose to 1.24 million ounces from 1.21 million 
ounces, defying analysts expectations for a year-on-year drop. 
Randgold increased its total dividend for 2016 by 52% on the back of the results, paying USD1.00 per share 
compared to the 66 cent dividend payout in 2015.
Mining peers Fresnillo and Glencore traded up 1.6% and 0.8%, respectively.

"Fresnillo and Glencore have also been pushed upwards as expectations of their gold earnings are increased. 
Fresnillo only recently logged record gold and silver output for 2016, and so could well outperform," said Michael 
Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
Banks continued their momentum from Friday, with Standard Chartered up 2.3%, Lloyds Banking, up 0.8% and 
Barclays up 0.4%. The sector was benefiting from US President Donald Trump's executive order to rein in the 
Dodd-Frank financial regulations, designed to constrain the amount of risk taken by lenders. 
Lloyds also was upgraded to Buy from Hold by analysts at HSBC.
Ryanair Holdings maintained its full-year guidance but with a very cautious outlook for the final months of its 
financial year, as the Irish budget airline reported Monday a decline in profit for its third quarter.
Ryanair said it still expects full-year profit after tax to be EUR1.30 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but said this guidance is 
heavily dependent on no unforeseen "security events" taking place in the final months of its financial year, ending 
March 31.

challenge for its business in the final months of its current financial year and into financial 2018. The stock traded 
down 2.6%. 
Gem Diamonds was the worst performer in the FTSE All-Share, down 6.7%, after the company said full-year 
production from the flagship Letseng mine remained broadly flat from the previous year, while output from the 
Ghaghoo mine more than halved.
The diamond miner said the Letseng mine in Lesotho produced 108,206 carats in 2016, in line with guidance and a 
touch below the 108,579 carats recovered in 2015, with the average grade not moving year-on-year at 1.63 
grammes of gold per tonne. 
The mine delivered seven diamonds that sold for "more than USD1 million" over the year. The miner said the 
operation recovered "fewer large special diamonds than expected". 
At Ghaghoo, which typically produces lower-value stones, reported a 55% production drop in 2016 to 40,976 carats 
from 91,499 carats, with grade dropping by one-third to 18.9 carats per hundred tonnes from 28 carats. 
Still ahead in the economic calendar, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will speak at the European 
Parliament in Brussels at 1400 GMT, and the US labor market conditions index is at 1500 GMT.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a potential backbench revolt, with rebel Tories threatening to vote with 
Labour and the Scottish National Party to change the Brexit Bill. The EU (Notification Of Withdrawal) Bill returns to 
the Commons for a further three days of debate during committee stage, giving MPs the chance to amend the 
legislation. Pro-Remain Conservatives are seeking assurances Parliament will get a say on the "endgame" if the 
Brexit negotiations collapse without a deal with the remaining 27 member states.
----------
A new UK survey pointed to fresh evidence that the weak pound will increase the price of products, amid warnings 
that domestic sales margins of firms are being squeezed. A survey of 1,500 businesses by the British Chambers of 
Commerce showed that almost half reported a negative impact on domestic sales caused by what is happening to 
sterling. One in four firms said the effect was positive, while almost as many revealed a negative impact. More than 
two thirds of those polled expect a fall in the value of sterling to increase their cost base this year, and just over half 
believe they will have to increase the price of their products and services.
----------
As businesses face heightened uncertainty, the UK government must adopt measures supporting business growth 
and prioritize stability in its budget next month, the Confederation of British Industry said. The government must 
focus on enhancing education and skills, which is key to improving people's life chances, to bolster the UK's 
productivity over the long term, the CBI, representing 190,000 businesses that together employ around a third of the 
UK's private sector workforce, said in a budget submission.
----------
Tens of thousands of protesters marched in London on Saturday against what demonstrators criticised as the 
"collusion" between May and US President Donald Trump. According to organisers around 40,000 people took part 
in the protests, which called on May to revoke her invitation to Trump for an official visit to Britain. Similar protests 
were also held in Edinburgh and Belfast. Demonstrators also demanded an end to the US leader's "Muslim ban" on 
travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
----------
A San Francisco court rejected a motion by the US Justice Department to immediately reinstate Trump's 
controversial travel ban. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco posted the denial on its 
website early Sunday, hours after the Justice Department filed for an emergency stay of a suspension of Trump's 
travel ban. The Justice Department argued in its appeal that a Seattle district court's ruling on Friday suspending 
Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries "harms the public," "second-guesses the president's 
national security judgement," and was "accompanied by virtually no legal analysis." Trump issued an executive 
order on January 27 that temporarily suspended the US refugee programme, banned travellers from Iraq, Syria, 
Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days and indefinitely banned Syrian refugees.
----------
Trump brushed off a description of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a "killer" and said Iran had "total disrespect 
for our country". In a televison interview, which aired on Fox News ahead of the Super Bowl, Trump would not say 
whether he would tear up the Iran nuclear deal, which went into effect a little over a year ago. Trump also said while 
he respected Putin, that didn't mean that he would get along with him. "I say it's better to get along with Russia than

not, and if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS (Islamic State), which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all 
over the world...that's a good thing."
----------
China's private sector expanded at the weakest pace in four months in January on slower increases in 
manufacturing and services, private survey results from IHS Markit showed. The Caixin composite output index fell 
to 52.2 in January from December's 45-month high of 53.5. Although a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the 
sector, the latest score suggested the slowest pace of expansion since September. Manufacturing companies 
reported a slower growth in output. Services activity growth also eased, but remained solid in January. The services 
Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 53.1 in January from 53.4 in December.

The euro's exchange rate is too low for Germany, and the European Central Bank's expansive monetary policy has 
inflated the German economy's export surplus, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told Tagesspiegel 
newspaper. "The ECB must make policy that works for Europe as a whole," Schaeuble said in an interview for 
Sunday's edition of the German newspaper, according to Reuters. "It is too loose for Germany," Schaeuble noted. 
Schaeuble's comments came after the Financial Times reported last week that Trump's top trade adviser accused 
Germany of currency exploitation.

Germany's factory orders expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in December, provisional data from 
Destatis showed. Factory orders climbed 5.2% on a monthly basis in December, in contrast to a revised 3.6% fall 
seen in November. The monthly growth was the fastest since July 2014, when the rate was 6.6% and also faster 
than the expected 0.5% increase.

Ireland's economic outlook remains broadly positive but risks are tilted to the downside, the International Monetary 
Fund said late Friday. Despite risks to the outlook, Ireland's capacity to repay the Fund is strong, given robust 
economic and fiscal performance, large cash buffers, manageable financing needs and favourable market financing 
conditions, the IMF Executive Board said concluding its sixth post-program monitoring discussion with Ireland. 
Nonetheless, the IMF said a growth slowdown to 3.2% continues to be forecast in 2017, as negative Brexit 
adjustment takes effect and the fiscal policy stance turns counter-cyclical.

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen turned fire on the EU, mass immigration and Islamic fundamentalism as she 
launched her bid for the French presidency on Sunday in the city of Lyon. She dubbed the EU a failure that had 
crippled France. "If the EU does not submit, then I will ask the French to vote in the referendum to resign from this 
nightmare," she told a crowd of some 3,000 supporters from her National Front party as a two-day rally came to a 
conclusion. A referendum on a so-called Frexit along the lines of the British vote in June 2016 to leave the bloc is a 
cornerstone of her campaign. She also questioned France's role within the military alliance NATO, saying the 
country should not be dragged into wars that were not her own.

2015. Total revenue for the year rose to USD1.20 billion from USD1.00 billion a year earlier, with overall costs

4,451 megawatts of de-rated electricity generation capacity from October 2017 to September 2018. The energy 
generator and supplier said the UK auction cleared at a price of GBP6.95 per kilowatt. SSE said the provisional 
results were published last Friday, but they are subject to confirmation by UK Secretary of State for Business, 
Energy & Industrial Strategy Greg Clark. The capacity market auction is the UK government initiative that ensures 
generators are building enough capacity for the future to ensure the country can meet its energy needs, 
guaranteeing generators a price for the electricity generated from projects that win contracts under the auction.

will retire in April, the paper said. Court was in charge of Direct Line when it was part of Royal Bank of Scotland

in various companies, the newspaper noted.

make payments at the restaurants and bars of 12 of its hotels between August and December last year of potential 
fraud. Findings of an investigation by the company showed malware was installed on servers which processed 
payment cards used in the restaurants of the affected properties. Cards used at front desks were not affected by 
the fraud.

Ryanair Holdings maintained its full-year guidance but with a very cautious outlook for the final months of its 
financial year, as the Irish budget airline reported a decline in profit for its third quarter. Ryanair said it still expects

Deutsche Bank apologised to Germans for its costly mistakes in the past with full-page ads in several German

loss of EUR1.4 billion in 2016. "We would like to apologise for that...Since I became chief executive of Deutsche 
Bank one-and-a-half years ago, we have had to pay around EUR5 billion in legal cases largely originating from 
several years ago," chief executive John Cryan said in the ad. Germany's biggest bank is still facing about 7,000

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are called for a flat open on Monday, with currencies taking centre 
stage after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the euro is too low against its major counterparts. 
In early UK company news, budget airline easyJet said it carried more passengers and achieved a higher load 
factor year-on-year in January, while peer Ryanair Holdings maintained its full-year earnings guidance but with a 
very cautious outlook for the final months of its financial year.
Meanwhile, Randgold Resources said it met the bottom of its production target for 2016, posting large rises in 
revenue and profit as a result of higher gold prices and lower costs.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open 1.9 points higher at 7,190.20. The index closed up 0.7%, or 
47.55 points, at 7,188.30 on Friday, ending 0.1% higher for the week. 
The euro's exchange rate is too low for Germany, and the European Central Bank's expansive monetary policy has 
inflated the German economy's export surplus, Schaeuble told Tagesspiegel newspaper.
"The ECB must make policy that works for Europe as a whole," Schaeuble said in an interview for Sunday's edition 
of the German newspaper, according to Reuters. "It is too loose for Germany," Schaeuble noted. 
The euro is quoted at USD1.0760 early Monday, hardly changed from USD1.0780 at the London equities close on 
Friday. 
Schaeuble's comments came after the Financial Times reported on Tuesday last week that Trump's top trade 
adviser accused Germany of currency exploitation.
Peter Navarro, head of Trump's National Trade Council, told the FT that the euro was like an "implicit Deutsche 
Mark" whose low valuation gave Germany an advantage over its main trading partners.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Flat Market Call; Ryanair Has Cautious Outlook
In early economic data Monday, provisional data from Destatis showed that Germany's factory orders expanded at 
the fastest pace in more than two years in December. Factory orders climbed 5.2% on a monthly basis in 
December, in contrast to a revised 3.6% fall seen in November. The monthly growth was the fastest since July 
2014, when the rate was 6.6% and also faster than the expected 0.5% increase.
Meanwhile, the pound stands at USD1.2483 before the London open Monday, soft compared to USD1.2498 at the 
close on Friday.
In a thin economic calendar on Monday, eurozone consumer confidence is at 0930 GMT. The US labor market 
conditions index is at 1500 GMT. 
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 
0.5%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong continues up 0.6%.
Survey results from IHS Markit showed that China's private sector expanded at the weakest pace in four months in 
January on slower increases in manufacturing and services.
The Caixin composite output index fell to 52.2 in January from December's 45-month high of 53.5. Although a 
reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, the latest score suggests the slowest pace of expansion since 
September.
Manufacturing companies reported slower growth in output. Services activity growth also eased, but remained solid 
in January. The services Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 53.1 in January from 53.4 in December.
Wall Street ended higher on Friday, with the Dow 30 up 0.9%, the S&P 500 up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite 
0.5% higher.
London-listed easyJet said it carried 4.7 million passengers in January, compared to 4.3 million a year earlier, up 
11%. On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers were up 6.9% to 74.9 million, it said.
The FTSE 100 budget carrier added its load factor improved by 1.2 percentage points in January to 86.2% from 
85.0% the year before. On the rolling 12-month measure, its load factor fell to 91.5% from 9.6%, down 0.1 
percentage point.
Dublin-listed Ryanair maintained its full-year guidance but with a very cautious outlook for the final months of its 
financial year, as the Irish budget airline reported a decline in profit for its third quarter.
Ryanair said it still expects full-year profit after tax to be EUR1.30 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but said this guidance is 
heavily dependent on no unforeseen "security events" taking place in the final months of its financial year, ending 
March 31.
The airline added that, looking to its 2018 financial year, pricing will continue to be "challenging" in a very 
competitive budget carrier market, but it intends to continue increasing capacity and benefiting from lower unit 
costs.
Meanwhile, Randgold Resources achieved gold production of 1.25 million, the very bottom of its 1.25 million to 1.30 
million ounce target range, rising from 1.21 million ounces in 2015. 
The African miner said total revenue for the year rose to USD1.20 billion from USD1.00 billion a year earlier, with 
overall costs dropping year-on-year to USD819.8 million from USD829.3 million.

"European markets look set to open slightly higher this week, with currencies likely to remain in focus once again

the currency is too low for Germany, and as such is responsible for the country's trade surplus," says CMC Markets 
chief market analyst Michael Hewson.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London were mixed at the open on Monday, with Randgold Resources 
leading FTSE 100 gainers after the gold miner hiked its dividend by 50%.
Randgold said the increase in payout was on the back of its 2016 production results, as it met the bottom of its 
target for the year, posting large rises in revenue and profit as a result of higher gold prices and lower costs. 
Meanwhile, shares in Ryanair Holdings were lower after the Irish budget airline maintained its full-year earnings 
guidance but with a very cautious outlook for the final months of its financial year.
The FTSE 100 index was up 2.23 points at 7,190.53. The FTSE 250 was down 0.1% at 18,395.39, and the AIM All-

Small Companies was up 0.1% at 10,866.57.
The French CAC 40 stock index was flat and the German DAX 30 was down 0.4%.

ECB President Mario Draghi will speak at the European Parliament in Brussels at 1400 GMT. Also on Monday, 
eurozone consumer confidence data are at 0930 GMT. 
Already released, provisional data from Destatis showed that Germany's factory orders expanded at the fastest

In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 
0.5%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong finished 1.0% higher.
Accendo Markets analyst Michael van Dulken said gains in London were limited by weak China Purchasing 
Managers Index readings, "fuelling fresh debate about the state of the Chinese economy". 
Survey results from IHS Markit showed that the Caixin composite output index fell to 52.2 in January from 
December's 45-month high of 53.5. Although a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, the latest score

Back in London, Randgold was up 4.0%. The miner achieved gold production of 1.25 million ounces, the very 
bottom of its 1.25 million to 1.30 million ounce target range, rising from 1.21 million ounces in 2015. Total revenue 
for the year rose to USD1.20 billion from USD1.00 billion a year earlier, with overall costs dropping year-on-year to 
USD819.8 million from USD829.3 million.
Pretax profit in the year increased to USD402.6 million from just USD260.8 million the year before. Profit 
attributable to shareholders increased to USD247.5 million from USD188.7 million. The African miner hikes its 2016

Shares in fellow miner Glencore were up 1.4%, while gold miner Fresnillo was up 0.8%. In the FTSE 250, 
Hochschild Mining was up 1.9%.

agreements under the 2017 capacity market auction to provide a total of 4,451 megawatts of de-rated electricity 
generation capacity from October 2017 to September 2018. 
Meanwhile, National Grid was up 0.2%. The firm said it has started a new share buyback programme with the "sole 
purpose" of reducing its share capital following the dilution that resulted from the take-up of its scrip dividend offer. 
The programme will end "no later" than February 17, and follows the end of the last share buyback programme on 
January 27. National Grid said it will purchase a maximum of GBP35 million worth of shares, capped at 3.5 million 
shares, with all purchased shares to be held in the treasury. 
Ryanair was down 1.9%. The air carrier maintained its full-year guidance but with a very cautious outlook for the 
final months of its financial year, as it reported a decline in profit for its third quarter. It said it still expects full-year 
profit after tax to be EUR1.30 billion to EUR1.35 billion, but said this guidance is heavily dependent on no

A San Francisco court has rejected a motion by the US Justice Department to immediately reinstate US President 
Donald Trump's controversial travel ban. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco posted the 
denial on its website early Sunday, hours after the Justice Department filed for an emergency stay of a suspension 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: US States Battle Trump Travel Ban In Appeals Court
of Trump's travel ban. The Justice Department argued in its appeal that a Seattle district court's ruling on Friday 
suspending Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries "harms the public," "second-guesses the 
president's national security judgement," and was "accompanied by virtually no legal analysis." On Monday, the US 
states of Washington and Minnesota both told a federal appeals court that chaos would be "unleashed" if Trump's 
immigration order were to be reinstated.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a potential backbench revolt, with rebel Tories threatening to vote with 
Labour and the Scottish National Party to change the Brexit Bill. The EU (Notification Of Withdrawal) Bill returns to 
the Commons for a further three days of debate during committee stage, giving MPs the chance to amend the 
legislation. Pro-Remain Conservatives are seeking assurances Parliament will get a say on the "endgame" if the 
Brexit negotiations collapse without a deal with the remaining 27 member states. The Prime Minister has promised 
MPs and peers will be given a vote on any agreement she reaches in the talks with Brussels. However pro-Remain 
MPs fear that if the negotiations fail, Britain would simply leave the EU without any agreement at all, with potentially 
serious consequences for the economy.

As British businesses face heightened uncertainty, the government must adopt measures supporting business 
growth and prioritise stability in its budget next month, the Confederation of British Industry said. The government 
must focus on enhancing education and skills, which is key to improving people's life chances, to bolster the UK's 
productivity over the long term, the CBI, representing 190,000 businesses that together employ around a third of the 
UK's private sector workforce, said in a budget submission. The industry lobby called for action in three areas - 
supporting firms in a more challenging and uncertain economic environment, improving the attractiveness of the UK 
as a place to do business, and focusing on education and skills to boost regional growth and productivity.
----------
Fresh evidence that the weak pound will increase the price of products emerged, amid warnings that domestic 
sales margins of firms are being squeezed. A survey of 1,500 businesses by the British Chambers of Commerce 
showed that almost half reported a negative impact on domestic sales caused by what is happening to sterling. One 
in four firms said the effect was positive, while almost as many revealed a negative impact. More than two thirds of 
those polled expect a fall in the value of sterling to increase their cost base this year, and just over half believe they 
will have to increase the price of their products and services.
----------
UK car registrations increased at the start of the year driven by higher demand from individual consumers, data 
from the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders showed. In January, car sales advanced 2.9% year-on-year to 
174,564 units, the highest level since 2005. Sales were largely underpinned by a 5% increase in private demand. 
Fleet demand rose marginally by 1.4%, while business registrations slid 1%. The alternatively fueled vehicle 
segment grew 19.9% to take a record 4.2% market share, the first time 4% has been surpassed, the SMMT said.
----------
China's private sector expanded at the weakest pace in four months in January on slower increases in 
manufacturing and services, private survey results from IHS Markit showed. The Caixin composite output index fell 
to 52.2 in January from December's 45-month high of 53.5. Although a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the 
sector, the latest score suggested the slowest pace of expansion since September. Manufacturing companies 
reported a slower growth in output. Services activity growth also eased, but remained solid in January.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets fluctuated between small gains and losses early Monday, but 
turned definitively lower in the afternoon. 
Economic data proved a mixed bag at the start of the new trading week, with Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence 
Index declining slightly in February, while German factory orders rose the most in two and a half years in 
December.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi testified before the European Parliament Monday. Draghi stated 
that the recent resilience shown by the euro area economy in the face of several negative shocks suggests it is on 
the right track, but it still requires monetary policy stimulus to bring inflation to the target in a sustainable way.
"Our December decisions strike a balance between our growing confidence that the euro area's economic 
prospects are firming up, and - at the same time - the lack of a clear sign of sustained convergence of inflation rates 
towards the desired level," Draghi said while addressing lawmakers in the European Parliament in Brussels.
Business leaders said the decision to leave the EU had a negative impact on their business since June, Ipsos Mori 
survey showed Monday.
The annual Ipsos MORI Captains of Industry study found that 58% felt negative impact of Brexit, while 31% said the 
Brexit had made no difference to the business situation.
"However, it is not all doom and gloom," Ben Page, CEO of Ipsos MORI, said. "32% of respondents said they think 
their business will start to feel the positive effects of leaving the EU in five years' time."
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.60%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 1.06%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.40%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 1.22% and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.98%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 
0.22% and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.24%.
European Markets Turned Lower After Draghi Comments
In Frankfurt, fish distributor, Deutsche See, sued Volkswagen over the automaker's emission cheating scandal, 
sending its stock down 2.58%.
Deutsche Bank fell 1.70%. The country's largest lender has apologized in full-page German newspaper ads for 
"serious errors" that cost the lender billions of euros.
In Paris, Total SA dipped 0.10% as oil prices edged higher on a weaker dollar and amid fears of new US sanctions 
against Iran.
In London, Randgold Resources jumped 4.15% as the gold miner hiked its 2016 dividend by over 50% after 
reporting a 76% jump in fourth-quarter net profit.
Shares of Ryanair Holdings fell 4.20% after the Irish no-frills airline issued cautious outlook for the remainder of the 
year after reporting an 8% drop in third-quarter profit.
Airline easyJet dropped 0.80% after reporting its passenger traffic and load factor figures for January.
Barclays declined 0.63% after reports that it is embarking on a major back office overhaul.
UniCredit dropped 6.86% in Milan after it signed a deal Saturday with trade unions to cut 3,900 jobs as part of a 
business plan unveiled in December by its new chief executive.
Eurozone investor confidence dropped less-than-expected in February as financial experts' assessment of the 
current situation was the strongest since mid-2011 though their expectations were hurt, mainly by the impact of the 
actions of the Trump administration, results of a monthly survey by Sentix showed Monday.
The investor confidence index for euro area fell to 17.4 from 18.2 in January, which was the highest score since 
August 2015, figures from the think tank showed. Economists had forecast a weaker reading of 16.5.
Germany's factory orders expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in December on robust domestic 
demand, provisional data from Destatis showed Monday. Factory orders climbed 5.2% on a monthly basis in 
December, in contrast to a 3.6% fall in November, which was revised from 2.5%.
The latest monthly growth was the biggest since July 2014, when the rate was 6.6% and also faster than the 
expected 0.5% increase.
German construction firms registered slower growth in January but were more optimistic about the coming year, 
survey data from IHS Markit showed Monday. The construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.0 in January 
from December's nine-month high of 54.9. This was the lowest score since last August.
Germany's real earnings increased at a stronger pace in 2016, data from Destatis showed Monday. The index of 
real earnings increased 1.8% in 2016 but slower than the 2.4% growth registered in 2015. In the same period, 
inflation was 0.5%.
China's private sector expanded at the weakest pace in four months in January on slower increases in 
manufacturing and services, private survey results from IHS Markit showed Monday. The Caixin composite output 
index fell to 52.2 in January from December's 45-month high of 53.5.
The services sector in China continued to expand in January, albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Caixin 
showed on Monday with a PMI score of 53.1.
That's down from 53.4 in December, although it remains well above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates 
expansion from contraction.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets traded in the green for the majority of Friday's session and a 
choppy day of trading with modest gains. Banks were among the best performing stocks at the end of the week. 
Reports that US President Trump will take action to reduce regulations on the banking industry drove the sector 
higher. Investor sentiment also received a boost from today's stronger than expected US jobs report.
Employment in the US increased by more than anticipated in the month of January, according to a report released 
by the Labor Department on Friday. The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 227,000 
jobs in January after climbing by a revised 157,000 jobs in December.
Economists had expected an increase of about 175,000 jobs compared to the addition of 156,000 jobs originally 
reported for the previous month.
Despite the stronger than expected job growth, the unemployment rate inched up to 4.8% in January from 4.7% in 
December. The rate had been expected to remain unchanged.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.71%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.60%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 0.98%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.20% and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.65%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 
0.67% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.90%.
In Frankfurt, retail giant Metro fell 3.09% after its fiscal first-quarter profit fell 64% to 200 million euros, hurt by 
currency fluctuations.
Deutsche Bank climbed 3.63% and Commerzbank added 0.60%.
In Paris, BNP Paribas gained 1.46% and Credit Agricole advanced 1.03%. Societe Generale also finished higher by 
0.42%.

In London, ITV increased 1.99% on a brokerage upgrade.
Homeserve dipped 0.33%. The residential repair and improvements firm has acquired stakes in two tradesman 
checking sites for a total of 37 million pounds.
Beazley soared 6.44% as the risk insurance and reinsurance provider lifted dividend after reporting a 3% increase 
in full-year pretax profit.
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings gained 0.68% after reporting increases in traffic and load factor in January.
Barclays increased 3.39% and Royal Bank of Scotland rose 2.70%. Syngenta finished lower by 0.47% in Zurich on 
a report that EU regulators are likely to clear its USD43 deal with ChemChina.
Skanska jumped 5.49% in Stockholm after reporting a rise in Q4 profit, helped by stronger-than-expected 
performance at all its property development businesses.
Banco Popular sank 7.43% in Madrid after reporting a massive annual loss, hit by extraordinary provisions and 
additional charges to clean up its balance sheet.
Intesa Sanpaolo rose 2.66% in Milan after the retail bank denied it was mulling an all-share offer for insurer 
Generali.
Eurozone retail sales dropped unexpectedly in December on food and auto fuel sales, figures from Eurostat 
revealed Friday. Retail sales fell 0.3% month-on-month in December, confounding expectations for an increase of 
0.3%. Nonetheless, the pace of decline slowed from a revised -0.6% in November.
The Eurozone economy made a strong start to 2017 with output growth maintained at December's five-and-a-half 
year high, final data from IHS Markit showed Friday. The composite output index held steady at 54.4 in January and 
slightly above the earlier flash estimate of 54.3. The indicator signaled expansion in each of the past 43 months.
UK service sector growth eased more-than-expected at the start of the year amid the slower output growth and 
higher costs, despite strong business expectations, survey data from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of 
Procurement and Supply showed Friday.
The CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector dropped to 54.5 from 56.2 in December. Economists 
had forecast a score of 55.8.
While the Institute for Supply Management released a report on Friday showing that activity in the US service sector 
saw continued growth in the month of January, the pace of growth in the sector slowed slightly compared to the 
previous month.
The ISM said its non-manufacturing index edged down to 56.5 in January from a revised 56.6 in December, 
although a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the service sector. Economists had expected the service sector 
index to dip to 57.0 from the 57.2 originally reported for the previous month.
Reflecting a sharp increase in orders for non-durable goods, the Commerce Department released a report on 
Friday showing a bigger than expected rebound in new orders for US manufactured goods in the month of 
December.
The Commerce Department said factory orders surged up by 1.3% in December after tumbling by a revised 2.3% in 
November. Economists had expected factory orders to increase by 0.9% compared to the 2.4% slump originally 
reported for the previous month.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Barclays lowered its price target on Wizz Air after the low-cost airline trimmed its 
guidance for full-year profit on Wednesday, but said it still thinks the stock offers good long-term value.
The Central and Eastern European-focused airline said pretax profit in its third quarter, covering the three months 
ended December 31, more than doubled to EUR33.1 million from EUR16.2 million the year before, as revenue grew 
to EUR341.1 million from EUR310.5 million.
However, Wizz Air trimmed its forecast for full-year net profit as it warned that lower fuel prices were continuing to 
feed through to lower airfares in 2017 and because of  "unusually severe" weather conditions disrupting its winter 
operations.
Wizz Air trimmed its net profit guidance to a range of EUR225 million to EUR235 million, down from its previous 
guidance of a range of EUR245 million to EUR255 million. In the previous financial year, full year net profit 
amounted to EUR183 million.
As a result, Barclays reduced its full-year earnings per share forecasts by 7% and 10% for financial 2017 and 
financial 2018, respectively, but praised Wizz Air for "rightly" prioritising long-term strategic gains over short-term 
profitability through plans to continue increasing capacity.
Barclays now forecasts fourth-quarter revenue per available seat kilometre to fall by 9% year-on-year, down on its 
prior forecast of a 6.5% decline, although it noted that pricing trends leading to this decrease are "perfectly 
understandable" given "aggressive competitor expansion".
"Arguably, Wizz could have preserved its profit guidance this winter simply by reducing its growth rate. However, 
with the company's margins among the very best in Europe, and ROIC well above its cost of capital, management's 
focus is understandably longer term, believing it is strategically important to lead the pace of growth to win territory 
from weaker legacy incumbents, and perhaps also to keep Ryanair at bay in the region," Barclays said.
IN THE KNOW: Barclays Optimistic On Wizz Air Despite Price Target Cut
This does mean, however, that margins will take some "self-inflicted" pain in the near term, the bank said, leading to 
a challenging financial 2018 year. Due to this. Barclays thinks earnings will decline slightly year-on-year, before 
recovering from financial 2019.
"We continue to think the stock offers good long term value, but in the nearer term, we expect the lack of earnings 
growth to weigh on the share price," Barclays said.
Barclays cut its price target to GBP17.60 from GBP19.00, and maintained its Equal Weight rating.
Shares in Wizz Air were trading down 4.1% at 1,549.55 pence on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Davy Research said it sees a positive inflection point for prices of long haul carriers, 
prompting an upgrade its rating on International Consolidated Airlines Group, but the broker downgraded easyJet 
due to competitive pressures. 
Davy analysts said capacity growth in the main short and long-haul European markets have been slowing, with 
short-haul growth decelerating for the first time since 2012. However, demand indicators have now turned positive 
for long-haul flights in continental Europe and the US. 
"Following a difficult 18 months, we think the long-haul carriers will soon hit an inflection point in pricing. This has 
already happened in the US, with improved close-in yields seen at all three major US-based carriers in December," 
Davy said. "Those most exposed to positive trends are IAG and Lufthansa."
Davy upgraded its rating for IAG to Outperform from Neutral. IAG was also upgraded by Goldman Sachs to Buy 
from Neutral and was one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 on Friday morning, up 2.0% at 501.50 pence. 
The Davy analysts said their analysis of the European low-cost carrier network found that easyJet's pricing 
weakness is due to "increasing competitive overlap", particularly from Ryanair Holdings. 
"easyJet generates the highest [earnings before interest and tax] per operating base of Europe's LCCs – it is 
somewhat vulnerable to encroaching competition from other LCCs," Davy said. 
Davy cut its rating on easyJet to Underperform from Neutral. Ryanair was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral. 
The Irish airline was up 1.0% at EUR14.785. 
Deutsche Bank also sees several "major risks" that could hurt easyJet. Analysts at the German bank said the 
budget carrier's first quarter results earlier this week were "not actually that bad", though the company will face 
pressure from slowing UK consumer outbound journeys as a result of the weaker pound. Deutsche said that further 
weakening of sterling, or increases in fuel price, will dampen earnings.
IN THE KNOW: IAG To Benefit From Inflection Point In Long-Haul Prices
Furthermore, there is likely to be sustained overcapacity in the industry for the next few years, which will squeeze 
underlying pricing. 
"Therefore, whilst we believe in easyJet's business model and strategy, we feel it is still too early to step in for a 
closer look," Deutsche said. 
The German bank maintained its Hold rating and lowered its price target to 915.00p from 935.00p.
easyJet was one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down 2.2% at 973.00p. The stock was also downgraded by 
Goldman Sachs to Neutral from Buy.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it could scrap its small number of UK 
domestic routes once the UK leaves the European Union, according to the company's chief financial officer, 
Bloomberg reported Wednesday.
Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said it would require a UK air operating certificate in order to continue domestic 
services there once Brexit is implemented, and as only 2.0% of its network involves these domestic flights, it may 
decide to withdraw them rather than take steps to comply with new regulations.
This would affect routes between London Stansted and Edinburgh and Glasgow, London Gatwick and Belfast, and 
three from Londonderry.
Shares in Ryanair closed down 0.4% at 14.74 pence Wednesday.

This would affect routes between London Stansted and Edinburgh and Glasgow, London Gatwick and Belfast, and 
three from Londonderry.
Shares in Ryanair closed down 0.4% at EUR14.74 Wednesday.

said Chief Commercial Officer David O'Brien in a statement.
Shares in Ryanair were up 0.5% at EUR14.97 Thursday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Panmure Gordon said Wizz Air Holdings is enjoying a purple patch and is well placed to 
take advantage of improving structural trends in the aviation industry. 
Panmure analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue said Wizz Air can claim to have a comparable and sustainable cost base to 
similar to market leader Ryanair, and can profitably offer low fares. This allows it to take advantage of improving 
structural trends such as increasing propensity to flying and positive migration trends.
"Wizz Air's low cost carrier model is an ideal fit for Central and Eastern Europe: the market is fragmented and often 
poorly served by (sometimes state backed) legacy carriers; the point-to-point network enables multiple connections; 
and there is a strong consumer culture of value," Irvine-Fortescue said. 
The analyst believes the low cost carrier market is growing and Wizz Air and Ryanair could together count for one 
third of the capacity in Central and Eastern Europe the first quarter of 2017.
Furthermore, the analyst noted that Wizz Air is less exposed to the UK, an area the analyst is cautious about 
following the Brexit vote. 
Panmure reiterated its Buy rating and 2,300.00 pence price target. 
Wizz Air traded down 0.4% at 1,854.08p on Friday afternoon.

UPDATE: Ryanair To Pursue Damages After EU Court Rules On Irish Tax

LONDON (Alliance News) - Airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Aer Lingus face paying EUR16.0 million in 
additional tax following a ruling by the European Court of Justice on Wednesday.
The court ruled that lower rates granted under Ireland's air travel tax, which has since been removed, for short 
flights between 2009 and 2011 amounted to an illegal subsidy for the carriers.
The Irish government put a travel tax in place in 2009 which charged EUR2.00 per passenger on flights up to 300 
kilometres and EUR10.00 a passenger on flights in excess of that length.
In 2012, the European Commission ordered the government to collect millions of euros in tax for passengers 
carried by Ryanair and Aer Lingus when the country then shifted to a EUR3.00 flat-rate tax.
Ryanair made a complaint about the new tax demand, but the European Union ruled the system in place between 
2009 and 2011 constituted illegal state aid as it favoured airlines, such as Ryanair and Aer Lingus, which mainly 
carry passengers on short-haul flights.
Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, is now owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, the owner of British 
Airways and Spain's Iberia.
On Wednesday, the European Court of Justice agreed with the EU that the tax represented illegal state aid. Aer 
Lingus will now have to pay up to EUR4.0 million to the Irish government, while Ryanair will have to pay around 
EUR12.0 million.
Ryanair was defiant after the ruling. "We have been expecting this judgement on Ireland’s illegal Air Travel Tax 
which now requires Ryanair to pay some EUR12 million to the Irish government on behalf of passengers who paid 
the lower EUR2 tax rate on shorter routes, despite the fact that we did not collect the EUR10 tax from these 
passengers," the company said in an emailed statement.
UPDATE: Ryanair To Pursue Damages After EU Court Rules On Irish Tax
"This ruling now clears the way for Ryanair (and other airlines) to pursue our High Court action against the Irish 
government to recover the EUR88 million of damages we suffered as a result of being forced to pay this illegal tax," 
the company added.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.1% to EUR14.48 on Wednesday, while IAG shares were down 0.8% to 448.60p.

Monks Investment Trust Enjoys Strong Returns Thanks To Weak Sterling
Monks Investment Trust Enjoys Strong Returns Thanks To Weak Sterling

LONDON (Alliance News) - The Monks Investment Trust PLC said Wednesday that its returns were boosted in the 
first half of its financial year by the depreciation in sterling. 
The FTSE 250-listed trust reported a net asset value total return of 25.3% for the six months to October 31, 
compared to a 23.6% return for the FTSE World Index over the same period. 
Earnings per share for the period were 1.68 pence, compared to 0.89p in the same period the prior year. Monks 
Investment Trust said that as previously announced in its latest annual results, it will pay no interim dividend. 
Monks said that the depreciation in sterling after the UK's vote to leave the European Union aided its returns over 
the half-year, as did the rally in equities towards the end of the period. 
The biggest stock contributors to performance according to Monks were technology stocks, including e-commerce 
giant Amazon.com Inc and Chinese online retailer Alibaba, as well as Google's parent company Alphabet Inc, and 
Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer TSMC. 
The trust, which is managed by Edinburgh-based investment manager Bailie Gifford, said that its investment 
managers reduced the trust's holdings in Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC and building materials company 
CRH PLC, while adding to its interest in life insurer Prudential PLC during the period. 
The trust said it has not yet made any adjustment to its portfolio in reaction to the election of Donald Trump as US 
president. 
"As with Brexit, the opacity of Trump's policies means that it is hard to fathom what might happen to the growth 
patterns of individual companies, particularly those with direct US exposure. The introduction of trade barriers and 
protectionism might lead to lower levels of international trade, which would not be the optimal backdrop for the 
portfolio. Nonetheless, Trump's stated desire of stimulating growth through internal investment could prove a boon 
to the US economy and the managers remain confident in the underlying growth of the US economy." said James 
Ferguson, chairman of the trust.
