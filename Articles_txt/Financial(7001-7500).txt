Both Ryanair and Wizz Air continue to see new opportunities in the Swedish market and are expanding their range 
of destinations on offer from the Greater Copenhagen region and Malmö Airport with new connections to the 
Balkans.
The Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair recently announced its return to Malmö Airport after being absent for a time. The 
airline will resume service to the Polish city of Krakow in early June and launch domestic service to Stockholm 
Arlanda this autumn. Another direct route will be launched in the autumn, this time to Ryanair's recently opened 
based in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.
The Hungarian low cost carrier Wizz Air, which currently flies to four countries in the Balkans from Malmö, is also 
adding a destination. In time for summer, the airline is offering a good weekend product to Banja Luka, the second 
largest city in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the capital, Sarajevo. Wizz Air also currently serves Tuzla twice weekly.
When the world opens up again, there is a longing to travel and meet people, and the routes will be a welcome 
addition, especially for leisure travellers who want to visit friends and relatives. There are a large number of people 
living in southern Sweden, and Skåne (Scania) in particular, with relations in the Balkans, including Bosnia-
Herzegovina and Croatia. Croatia is also a very popular tourist destination for Swedes.
"It is very gratifying that both Ryanair and Wizz Air see opportunities in Southern Sweden and the Greater 
Copenhagen region and have chosen to expand at Malmö Airport, especially after a period that has been 
extremely difficult for the whole industry. The entire Balkan region is a popular destination from Malmö, and these 
destinations are an important addition and complement to our existing range of flights, for tourists in general but 
especially for the important visiting friends and relatives travel segment. Access will be important in the restart after 
the pandemic, and more direct air links are crucial to regional growth and to the tourism industry all across 
Sweden," says Elizabeth Axtelius, Director Aviation Business at Swedavia Airports.
"We are cautiously optimistic since the vaccination roll-out, the pandemic and travel restrictions are critical to the 
recovery both in Sweden and around the world. We hope the situation will allow this and that our passengers are 
ready to travel again this summer," concludes Elizabeth Axtelius.
Ryanair and Wizz Air continue to expand at Malmö Airport and add two more direct routes
Wizz Air will serve Malmö Airport (MMX) - Banja Luka International Airport (BNX) twice weekly with an A320 aircraft 
model starting June 25, 2021.
Ryanair will serve Malmö Airport (MMX) - Zagreb Franjo Tudman Airport (ZAG) twice weekly, on Tuesdays and 
Saturdays, starting in September 2021.

European court rules rescue of Spain's Air Europa was legal

The General Court of the European Union has ruled that the EUR475 million euros (USD578.8 million) in Spanish 
government loans handed to Air Europa (UX, Palma de Mallorca) last year was legal, rejecting a case Ryanair (FR, 
Dublin Int'l) had brought against the European Commission, which approved the aid. The state funds, which Madrid 
approved in October 2020 and which were provided through the sovereign wealth fund (Sociedad Estatal de 
Participaciones Industriales - SEPI), were part of a EUR10 billion (USD12.2 billion) fund in Spain for pandemic-hit 
companies that the European Commission greenlit last July. In its May 19 ruling, which can still be appealed at 
Court of Justice of the European Union, the general court said that the measure complied with EU law and had 
been "proportionate and non-discriminatory". As previously reported, in two other judgements on the same day the 
court agreed with Ryanair on state aid for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KL, Amsterdam Schiphol) and TAP Air 
Portugal (TP, Lisbon), annulling European Commission approvals of loans to the flag carriers of EUR3.4 billion 
(USD4.15 billion) and EUR1.2 billion (USD1.46 billion), respectively. 
In the Spanish case, the Irish low-cost carrier had requested the cancellation of the SEPI fund for Covid-struck 
strategic companies. It argued that the fund had been a discriminatory measure violating the right to the free 
provision of services in the EU by benefitting only companies based in Spain. It also claimed that the commission 
had erred in allowing Madrid to choose the beneficiaries at its discretion. The court dismissed these allegations, 
confirming that the measure respected EU law, as the objective of the fund has been to remedy the serious 
disturbance that the pandemic inflicted on the Spanish economy in the medium and long term. The court declared 
that "the restriction of the scheme at issue to non-financial undertakings which are of systemic or strategic 
importance for the Spanish economy, which are established in Spain and have their principal places of business in 
its territory, is both appropriate and necessary in order to achieve the objective of remedying the serious 
disturbance in the Spanish economy." Moreover, Ryanair had not managed to prove "how being deprived of access 
to recapitalisation measures covered by the scheme at issue would deter it from establishing itself in Spain or from 
providing services to and from Spain," the ruling said. In addition, the court rejected as unfounded Ryanair's claim 
that the commission had erred in considering that the fund constituted a state aid scheme. Air Europa and Ryanair 
were not immediately available for comment.

Aer Lingus to close Shannon base amid restructuring plan

As feared, Aer Lingus (EI, Dublin Int'l) outlined in a statement on May 18 plans to close its base at Shannon Airport, 
among other cost cuts and layoffs, as part of a company-wide restructuring programme. It will also temporarily shut 
down its base at Cork from September until late November to coincide with construction work on the runway, and it 
will review its groundhandling operations at both locations, it said. At Shannon, 81 cabin crew who work from the 
base will be offered enhanced severance or to transfer to the airline's Dublin Int'l hub, while a further 45 ground staff 
in Shannon will be laid off. 
At Cork, Aer Lingus employs about 60 ground staff and 98 cabin crew. In its statement, the IAG International 
Airlines Group-owned flag carrier said it had "confirmed to staff that the airline will emerge smaller from the 
pandemic, and there will be a requirement for redundancies." It added that "structural change will also be required 
across the business" and "the required structural changes will be specific to each business area but will focus 
primarily on the areas where there is off-market pay, terms, conditions, and work practices." Explaining that the 
measures were necessary after it posted a EUR103 million euro (USD126 million) loss for the first quarter of 2021, 
which compounded a EUR563 million (USD689 million) loss for 2020, Aer Lingus said: "The cumulative impact of 
the crisis over the last 15 months means immediate actions and structural changes are required" to generate the 
cash needed to rebuild its financial health. Aer Lingus has blamed its strife on the Irish government's tough Covid-
19 travel restrictions. Responding to appeals in the parliament for the government to intervene, Prime Minister 
Micheál Martin said that the layoffs were "very sad news" and promised "to respond to the aviation issue," the 
national broadcaster RTÉ reported. The government is currently considering proposals for a gradual reopening of 
international travel. In a brief statement, Shannon Airport said that "restoring regional connectivity and international 
travel will be pivotal to economic recovery as we emerge from the effects of the pandemic. Critical to this will be the 
urgent implementation of a clear road map and timelines for the restart of aviation." The Irish Airline Pilots 
Association, which represents more than 1,200 pilots at carriers such as Aer Lingus and Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), 
said the layoffs were a direct result of government policy "and its continued inaction on aviation," describing Ireland 
as an "outlier" in the European Union with "the most restrictive travel regime" yet all the while ignoring the plight of 
aviation and its workers.

EasyJet 's First-half Net Loss Widens As Virus Bites
EasyJet's First-half Net Loss Widens As Virus Bites

May 20, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 British airline EasyJet revealed Thursday that first-half net losses deepened as the pandemic ravaged demand, but 
expressed optimism over the reopening of travel in Europe. 
The group faced a loss after taxation of ?549 million (637 million euros, $777 million) in the six months to the end of 
March compared with a loss of ?324 million a year earlier. 
Passenger numbers tumbled by almost 90 percent to 4.1 million, EasyJet said in a results statement published after 
the UK partially lifted international air travel on Monday. 
The airline, which is based in Luton north of London, added more than 150,000 seats on flights after the British 
government announced so-called green list countries -- from which UK passengers will not need to quarantine upon 
their return home. 
The UK green list currently comprises a handful of nations and territories including EasyJet destinations Gibraltar, 
Iceland and Portugal. 
"EasyJet is encouraged by the reopening of travel across much of Europe and will maximise opportunities for 
European flying," the carrier said. 
"EasyJet is the largest operator from the UK to green list countries and is looking forward to taking customers on a 
long-awaited holiday this summer." 
 The airline will fly only 15 percent of its 2019 capacity levels in the third quarter, or three months to the end of June, 
but this is expected to be ramped up thereafter. 
It also logged a first-half pre-tax loss of ?701 million, widening from ?193 million last time around, but this was at the 
lower end of guidance. 
 EasyJet's losses widened but the airline says it is "encouraged by the reopening of travel across much of Europe".

"With leisure travel taking off in the UK again earlier this week ... and with so many European governments easing 
restrictions to open up travel again, we are ready to significantly ramp up our flying for the summer with a view to 
maximising the opportunities we see in Europe," noted EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren. 
"We have the ability to flex up quickly to operate 90 percent of our current fleet over the peak summer period to 
match demand," he added. 
Meanwhile, headline costs excluding fuel were slashed by nearly 60 percent to ?844 million on the back of capacity 
cutbacks and its efficiency drive. 
EasyJet 's First-half Net Loss Widens As Virus Bites
The results come after its Irish low-cost rival Ryanair posted Monday an annual net loss of 1.0 billion euros but also 
added that a recovery was underway. 
In a separate development this week, EU member states agreed Wednesday to reopen the bloc's borders to 
travellers who have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to European sources. 
Diplomats, meeting in Brussels, also agreed to increase the level of new cases a country can hit before being 
declared unsafe -- a measure that would open up travel into the EU from more places. 
The recommendations will be adopted by EU ministers on Friday, the sources said. 
Non-essential travel into the 27-member European Union has been banned since March 2020, apart from a small 
number of countries deemed safe because of their low Covid case rate.

Ryanair scores first court wins over state aid for flag carriers
Ryanair scores first court wins over state aid for flag carriers

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair yesterday scored its first partial victories at the EU's second-highest court against rival 
airlines propped up by state aid during the pandemic.
The General Court ruled that the European Commission argued insufficiently as to why Portugal's TAP airline and 
the Netherlands' KLM should receive state aid totalling (EURO)4.6bn last June.
But the court said given the "damaging impact of the pandemic", the airlines did not have to pay back the money 
pending decisions by the commission.
Still, it marks a victory for Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, who has succeeded for the first time in getting 
state aid decisions favouring rivals annulled in an EU court after filing more than 20 complaints.
He has been a fierce critic of state support given to national flag carriers, which he said would not be paid back to 
governments in what amounted to subsidies and a suppression of competition.
One of his other complaints was dismissed by the court yesterday. This was a challenge against Spain's state aid 
scheme for strategic non-financial companies, which was set up last July and worth (EURO)10bn.
Ryanair scores first court wins over state aid for flag carriers
Ryanair welcomed the court's rulings on the Portuguese and Dutch cases, saying funding of those carriers "went 
against the fundamental principles of EU law and reversed the clock on the process of liberalisation in air transport 
by rewarding inefficiency and encouraging unfair competition".
O'Leary argued support made available to flag carriers only was discriminatory and undermined the EU's single 
market in air travel. He has labelled carriers including Air France and KLM as state-aid "junkies", but others in the 
industry argue that the support was needed to help airlines survive an unprecedented collapse in passenger 
numbers. The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TAP could not be reached. KLM 
said it had taken note of the judgment and would review it.
The court's decision follows defeats on state aid for the commission, on Apple last year and Amazon this month. In 
those rulings, the court found the commission had not proven how the tech groups benefited from alleged illegal 
state aid in Ireland and Luxembourg in the form of sweetheart tax deals.

 https://www.litigationfutures.com/wp-content/uploads/Air-Canada.jpg Air Canada: Liable to pay compensation 
The High Court has given yet another boost to flight delay practices after ruling that a passenger who boarded in 
London but suffered a delay on the second leg of her flight in Canada was entitled to compensation. 
It comes as the Supreme Court today considers a controversial ruling that a law firm handling uncontested flight 
delay claims was not conducting litigation and so did not have an equitable lien over the compensation. 
In Varano v Air Canada [2021] EWHC 1336 (QB)[1], Marjolyn Varano flew with Air Canada from London to Toronto 
and then onwards to Austin, Texas. There were no issues with the first flight, but the second leg was delayed by 
nearly six hours. 
EU flight compensation rules (EU Regulation 261/2004) have been adopted into domestic law post Brexit, but Air 
Canada argued that, as the disrupted flight in question was outside of the EU, the rules did not apply and Ms 
Varano could not claim the €600 due under the regulation. 
Sitting as a deputy High Court judge, Geraint Webb QC disagreed. He found that Regulation 261 'imposed a 
contingent liability on Air Canada when it operated the flight from Heathrow, namely a liability to pay compensation 
to Ms Varano if she experienced relevant delay in respect of arrival at the final destination 
'Contrary to the submissions of Air Canada, the existing case law has held that such an interpretation of Regulation 
261 is not precluded by the territoriality principle.' 
The contingent liability was imposed when the airline was within the jurisdiction, irrespective of its nationality or 
where the delay was caused. 
The case was brought by Hampshire law firm Hayward Baker, which in March also won a Court of Appeal ruling 
that the captain's non-attendance due to illness did not amount to the 'extraordinary circumstance' defence under 
Regulation 261. 
Separately, the European Court of Justice ruled in March that airlines still have to compensate passengers whose 
flights are cancelled or delayed by more than three hours where the disruption was caused by a union-led workers 
strike. 
The Supreme Court is today hearing Cheshire firm Bott &#38; Co's appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision[2] 
in its claim against Ryanair, which was criticised for not giving solicitors credit for being more business-like and 
efficient. 
The case concerned Ryanair dealing directly with the law firm's clients, including paying them compensation. 
High Court boosts flight delay claims at Supreme Court hears Bott case
Bott &#38; Co has led the market in developing a flight delay practice. The process is largely automated unless the 
airline disputes the claim. 
The court said the firm was not conducting litigation when the claims were not contested, and so did not have an 
equitable lien over the compensation. The court said 30% of clients did not pass on the fees due to Bott. 
Nick Bacon QC, representing Bott &#38; Co, told the Supreme Court that a solicitor using technology should be 
treated the same as a 'more sedentary' solicitor in the Home Counties using a typewriter. 
He went on: 'Litigation is heading towards platform-based resolution and the law shouldn't be concerned by the 
ease with which the recoveries may be made Has there been legal input which has resulted in the recovery? That 
should be the focus.' 
The Supreme Court granted permission so it could consider what the limits were to the principle set out in Gavin 
Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co Ltd [2018] UKSC 21, under which a solicitor can ask the court to 
grant an equitable lien in order to protect their entitlement to fees as against their client.

BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union court on Wednesday annulled the EU's approval of 3.4 billion euros 
($4.1 billion) in state aid for the Dutch carrier KLM but suspended its immediate application because of the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry.
In a similar ruling backing a challenge from Irish air carrier Ryanair, the court also overturned the EU's decision to 
back state aid to the TAP Portuguese carrier for a potential total of 1.2 billion euros, but also suspended its 
application pending a new EU decision.
In both cases, the Luxembourg-based General Court said that the European Commission had to come up with 
more complete reasoning why such aid could be granted.
The two rulings were a success for Ryanair which had been stymied in its attempts to challenge before the court 
such state aid to other EU airlines.
The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, which polices state aid and other competition issues, has 
approved several aid plans for struggling airline companies in the wake of the pandemic, especially after border 
closures and other restrictions halted most air travel.
Ryanair had argued that the aid constituted unfair state bailouts for national carriers.
The rulings of the General Court can be appealed on points of law only.

EU officials agreed on Wednesday to lift the ban on non-essential travel coming from outside the bloc, including 
from the UK.
The Commission is due to release a list of approved countries soon, Reuters reported.
READ: Portugal holidays on again as entry requirements eased
Currently, each country makes their own rules, with Portugal, Italy and Greece having already dropped mandatory 
isolation for UK passengers.
However, most European countries are on Westminster's 'amber' list, meaning that people returning to the UK have 
to present a negative COVID-19 test on arrival, quarantine for ten days and take additional tests on days 2 and 8 of 
isolation, which adds up to the normal costs of a holiday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should not travel to 'amber' countries for recreational purposes.
"I think it's very important for people to grasp what an amber list country is: it is not somewhere where you should 
be going on holiday, let me be very clear about that," he was reported as saying by the BBC.
"And if people do go to an amber list country, they absolutely have to for some pressing family or urgent business 
reason, then please bear in mind that you will have to self-isolate, you'll have to take tests and do your passenger 
locator form and all the rest of it."
Travel confusion remains as EU to lift restrictions on UK travellers but quarantine required upon return
The statement came after environment secretary George Eustice said Britons could travel to 'amber' countries as 
long as they quarantined on their return.
There have been reports that thousands of people went to France, Greece, Spain and the US after the ban on non-
essential travel was lifted on Monday, with 150 departing on that day.
Meanwhile, analysts at Liberum upped their target price for Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) to (EURO)17 from (EURO)16 
after increasing revenue estimates for the year to March 2023 by 3% to (EURO)8.9bn.
However, they cut estimates for the year ending next March by 7% to 4.9bn due to international travel restrictions 
being lifted slowly.
"While there is undoubtedly pent-up demand for leisure and social travel, much of it is going unfulfilled for the time 
being. We continue to assume a rebound in capacity from the September quarter, in anticipation of the restrictions 
on international travel being relaxed to a much greater extent," the broker commented.
In this scenario, capacity in the quarter would be at 75% of 2019 levels, surging to 90% in the six months to March 
2022.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1% to (EURO)16.16 on Wednesday at noon.

The General Court of the European Union has upheld a Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) challenge to billion of euros in 
state aid given to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KL, Amsterdam Schiphol) and TAP Air Portugal (TP, Lisbon), 
overturning European Commission decisions that allowed the Netherlands to give EUR3.4 billion euros (USD4.15 
billion) to the Dutch wing of Air France-KLM and Portugal's EUR1.2 billion (USD1.46 billion) grant to TAP. The 
Luxembourg-based court ruled that regulators had failed to justify the huge cash injections. In KLM's case, it 
pointed out that the French government had already handed its sister company Air France (AF, Paris CDG) EUR7 
billion (USD8.55 billion) and ruled as inadmissible the commission's argument that this would not also benefit the 
Dutch carrier. 
As for TAP, the court agreed with Ryanair that the commission had failed to properly justify its decision to greenlight 
the aid. It argued that "the commission failed to state the reasons for the contested decision to the requisite legal 
standard and that this inadequacy of the statement of reasons requires the annulment of the decision." However, 
the annulments of the state aid, and the recovery of the funds, will be suspended until new decisions emerge from 
the commission in light of the rulings. If Ryanair, which brought the cases to the court, is then not satisfied with the 
new decisions, it can challenge them once again. KLM said in reaction to the judgement that for now, it had no 
consequence as the aid would not have to be repaid until the commission had looked again at its decision. TAP has 
so far declined to comment, but Portugal's prime minister, Antonio Costa, told reporters that the rulings were 
"preliminary" and "a precautionary measure aimed at asking the European Commission for additional information," 
the business daily Jornal de Negócios reported. "In confronting the crisis that has hit civil aviation around the world, 
it would have been unthinkable for the European Commission not to lift restrictions on state aid, which virtually all 
European airlines have resorted to, and even more significantly than TAP," Costa said. Ryanair welcomed the 
rulings, arguing that "the European Commission's approvals of state aid to Air France-KLM and TAP went against 
the fundamental principles of EU law and reversed the clock on the process of liberalisation in air transport by 
rewarding inefficiency and encouraging unfair competition." It stressed that during the Covid-19 pandemic over 
EUR30 billion in "discriminatory state subsidies" had been "gifted" to European flag carriers. The rulings are for two 
of more than 20 appeals it has so far filed before the General Court, it added.

The European Union's second highest court dealt a blow to the European Commission on Wednesday, ruling that a 
complaint by Ryanair about state aid to other airline companies was justified.
The court annulled the commission's decisions approving coronavirus-related state aid to Dutch KLM and 
Portuguese airline TAP. The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to 
be paid out, the court ruled on Wednesday.
However, the effects of the annulment - including the order to pay back the aid - are suspended until the 
commission submits a new decision. Effectively, this means that the EU General Court's judges are giving the 
commission a chance to issue a more detailed decision.
The commission had green-lighted state support of 3.4 billion euros (4.15 billion dollars) for KLM and 1.2 billion 
euros for TAP.
Ryanair took the commission to court in a slew of cases, arguing that this move distorted competition in the bloc.
While the court sided with Ryanair in the cases of KLM and TAP, it ruled that 10-billion-euro aid to "strategic 
Spanish undertakings experiencing temporary difficulties due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic" was 
appropriate.
Ryanair also lost similar cases related to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair last month, which a spokesperson said the 
company would appeal.
A Ryanair spokesperson welcomed Wednesday's decisions on TAP and KLM.
"Unless halted by the EU courts in line with today's rulings, this state aid spree will distort the market for decades to 
come," the spokesperson said.

 The General Court in Luxembourg upheld Ryanair's (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) challenge against state aid provided to Air 
France-KLM (AF.PA, AF.AS) and TAP Air Portugal, Reuters reported Wednesday.
The court annulled the European Commission's approval of the financial aid provided by the Netherlands and 
Portugal to bolster the airlines during the COVID-19 pandemic on grounds of inadequate reasons.
The commission approved a 3.4 billion-euro ($4.15 billion) bailout by the Dutch government for KLM and a 1.2 
billion-euro loan for Transportes Aereos Portugueses.
However, Ryanair's challenge against a 10 billion-euro Spanish fund for companies impacted by the COVID-19 
pandemic was rejected by the court.
Shares in both Ryanair and Air France-KLM were down almost 2% on Wednesday midday.

May 19, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported a loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 (which ended Mar 
31, 2021) due to the coronavirus-induced air-travel demand softness. Notably, total revenues at this European low-
cost carrier plunged 89.2% year over year due to the tepid air traffic. 
Meanwhile, Latin-American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[2] stated that its sales in April improved 75% from the March 
level as air-travel demand rebounds on increased vaccination programs. The scenario in the United States is rosier 
as domestic air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is northbound. Notably, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[3] 
also aims to hire 184 pilots in the coming months[4] to meet this demand swell. 
Anticipating the demand uptick to continue in the summer season, United Airlines UAL[5] intends to boost its 
domestic schedule for July by adding daily flights in excess of 400. On the international front, United Airlines plans 
to add as well as resume some services to European destinations, courtesy of an uptick in demand. Delta Air Lines 
DAL[6] had also provided an expansion update on the international front as reported in the previous week's 
writeup[7]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong 
Sell), posted a wider-than-expected loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to weak revenues. In 
fact, its operations were hurt by coronavirus-induced disruptions throughout fiscal 2021 as exemplified by the 81% 
traffic reduction. In fact, the airline regarded fiscal 2021 as the most 'challenging' in its 35-year history. On a further 
positive note, Ryanair hopes to return to pre-coronavirus levels of growth in summer 2022[8]. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here[9]. 
2. Owing to its decision to boost the domestic network in July, United Airlines expects to operate 80% of its pre-
pandemic U.S. schedule in the month as summer travel bookings rise. On the domestic front, the carrier will add 
services to Bozeman, MT; Orange County, CA; Raleigh, N.C. and Yellowstone/Cody, WY. From Chicago, IL, the 
airline will operate more than 480 daily departures while from Washington D.C. it will operate above 220 daily 
departures. Notably, the Chicago-based carrier will expand its July domestic network by 17% from its June[10] 
level. 
3. Alaska Air Group's ALK[11] subsidiary Alaska Airlines aims to expand its fleet again in response to better 
demand witnessed in the United States. Alaska Airlines expects domestic travel to return to pre-COVID levels by 
the summer of 2022. To meet this anticipated demand uptick, the airline aims to add 17 Embraer 175 jets to the 
regional fleet in 2022 and 2023[12], of which nine will be operated by Horizon Air and eight by SkyWest.

4. Mirroring improved air-travel demand, Gol Linhas operated approximately 200 daily flights on peak days and 
covered 67 destinations in April. The carrier's consolidated gross revenues totaled approximately R$250 million in 
the month. Passenger revenue per available seat kilometers or PRASK rose 38% month over month as well as 5% 
year over year on higher ticket pricing owing to dynamic yield management and recovery in travel demand 
compared with April 2020[13]. 
5. Despite the recent improvement, air-travel demand in the United States remains below the pre-coronavirus 
levels. This is reflected in Allegiant's passenger count that showed 20.4% less flyers under its scheduled service in 
April 2021 than April 2019. Scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) also declined 21.6% in the 
month from the April 2019 tally. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service too slid 0.6% 
from the April 2019 reading[14]. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline 
players over the past week and during the last six months. 
The table above shows that all airline stocks barring Copa Holdings CPA[15] have traded in the green in the past 
week, leading the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to gain 2.7% to $106.45. Over the course of the past six months, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 41%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for usual news 
updates in the space. 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to 
gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could 
fuel exceptional growth. 
Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on 
the ground floor.

 Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] announced a new service from Teesside, United Kingdom to Faro, Portugal as part 
of its UK Summer 2021 Schedule. The move follows the United Kingdom's green list announcement, which allows 
England residents to visit certain countries without having to quarantine on their return. Portugal being one of the 
green-listed countries, people of England have been allowed entry into the country since May 17, when the 
relaxation went into effect and Portuguese authorities also opened its borders for tourists from the United Kingdom. 
Visitors will have to show a negative coronavirus test result upon arrival in Portugal. 
Ryanair's Teesside-Faro flights will be operational twice a week from Jun 16 onward. From Teesside, the carrier will 
also begin services to Alicante and Palma de Mallorca in Spain this June, and to Corfu, Greece in July. 
The airline is offering a sale with fares of 19.99 available for travel from June through October 2021. To avail this 
low 
fare,

 In this Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2019 file photo, a Ryanair airplane approaching landing at Lisbon airport flies past the 
Monument to the Heroes of the Peninsular War, in the foreground. A top European Union court on Wednesday, 
May 19, 2021 annulled the EU's approval of 3.4 billion euros in state aid for the Dutch carrier KLM but suspended 
its immediate application because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry. In a similar ruling 
backing a challenge from Irish air carrier Ryanair, the court also annulled the EU's decision to back state aid to the 
TAP Portuguese carrier for a potential total of 1.2 billion euros, but also suspended its application pending a new 
EU decision. (AP Photo/Armando Franca, File) 
BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union court on Wednesday annulled the EU's approval of 3.4 billion euros 
($4.1 billion) in state aid for the Dutch carrier KLM but suspended its immediate application because of the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry.  
 In a similar ruling backing a challenge from Irish air carrier Ryanair, the court also overturned the EU's decision to 
back state aid to the TAP Portuguese carrier for a potential total of 1.2 billion euros, but also suspended its 
application pending a new EU decision. 
 In both cases, the Luxembourg-based General Court said that the European Commission had to come up with 
more complete reasoning why such aid could be granted.  
 The two rulings were a success for Ryanair which had been stymied in its attempts to challenge before the court 
such state aid to other EU airlines.  
 The EU's executive arm, the European Commission, which polices state aid and other competition issues, has 
approved several aid plans for struggling airline companies in the wake of the pandemic, especially after border 
closures and other restrictions halted most air travel. 
 Ryanair had argued that the aid constituted unfair state bailouts for national carriers. 
 The rulings of the General Court can be appealed on points of law only.

7 Stocks to Watch When Student Debt Forgiveness Gets Passed[2] Now that the Biden administration is fully in 
charge, student debt forgiveness has moved to the front burner. Consider these numbers. There is an estimated 
$1.7 trillion in student debt. The average student carries approximately $30,000 in student loans. 
EU court annuls approval of KLM, TAP aid, wants more info
 If $10,000 of student debt were to be canceled, there are estimates that one-third of borrowers (between 15 million 
to 16.3 million) would become debt-free. Of course, if the number hits $50,000 as some lawmakers are suggesting 
the impact would even greater. 
 Putting aside personal thoughts on the wisdom of pursuing this path, it has the potential to unleash a substantial 
stimulus into the economy. 
 And as an investor, it's fair to ask where that money would go. After all, there's no harm in having investors profit 
from this stimulus as well. 
 A counter-argument is that the absence of one monthly payment may not provide enough money to make an 
impact. However, Senator Elizabeth Warren referred to the effect student loans have in preventing many in the 
millennial and Gen-Z generations from pursuing big picture life goals such as buying a house, starting a business, 
or starting a family.

 The Irish budget carrier, a vocal critic of state bailouts for legacy competitiors, hailed the ruling by judges in 
Luxembourg. It said aid granted to TAP and KLM only succeded in "rewarding inefficiency."Ryanair, the Irish budget 
airline, won two rare EU legal victories on Wednesday in a long-running row over state aid rules. 
It had filed complaints with the bloc's General Court in Luxembourg over subsidies provided to Dutch carrier KLM 
and Portugal's TAP. 
Both airlines were provided with government-backed loans at the height of the coronavirus pandemic that were 
signed off by EU competition officials. 
But judges ruled that no repayments would need to be made until the European Commission had made a new 
decision on the loans. 
TAP has yet to comment on the court's decision, while a spokesperson for KLM told Reuters that it was of no 
consequence given that the EU executive will need to rethink its original stance. 
The Commission has the sole power to police anti-trust rules across the 27-member bloc. 
Dublin-based Ryanair can still appeal the ruling. 
Ryanair slams EU over state aid policies 
The firm said in a statement that the EU had "reversed the clock" on fair competition by "rewarding inefficiency." 
The Irish company on Monday posted its biggest loss in its 35-year history, recording a loss of €815 million ($990 
million).  
Governments around the world have pumped money into legacy carriers as demand for air travel slumped amid 
global coronavirus lockdowns. 
Ryanair has filed a total of 16 lawsuits with EU authorities to challenge whether the financial help is legal.  
Just last month, the same court ruled in favor of bailouts for Scandanavian giant SAS and Finland's Finnair. 
In February, SAS and Air France escaped punishment over breaking EU state aid rules. 
Ryanair is also pursuing a similar case against the rescue package for German flagship carrier Lufthansa.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) received a boost to its price target from Credit Suisse late Monday after the Ireland-
based budget airline reported fiscal Q4 results. 
Credit Suisse now has a price target of EUR18.65 on the Dublin-traded stock, up from EUR17.91. This brings the 
target further above the stock's recent trading level of EUR16.45.
American depositary shares of Ryanair edged up slightly in recent Tuesday pre-market trading in the US after the 
stock fell 2% in Monday's session to $113.62.
Monday, Ryanair reported it swung to a net loss for its fiscal year ended March 31 as revenue tumbled amid a 
plunge in passengers due to COVID-19 restrictions.
However, the company also said it believes COVID-19 vaccines can lead to "a strong recovery in air travel, jobs, 
and tourism" in the second half of the current fiscal year. It added that "recent strong increases in weekly bookings 
since early April [suggest] that this recovery has already begun."
In a note to clients, Credit Suisse analysts said "Whereas the timing of traffic recovery remains very uncertain, we 
take comfort from [Ryanair's] commentary that consumers were moving ahead of government restrictions to book 
flights for summer travel." The firm said the cash flow from forward bookings can help Ryanair begin to de-leverage.
Ryanair "has the opportunity to structurally improve network quality, its cost base and indeed customer service to 
maximize its opportunity to emerge stronger from the pandemic, and leverage market share gains fully," the Credit 
Suisse analysts added.

On average, analysts polled by Capital IQ have an outperform investment rating on the company's domestic 
shares, with price targets ranging from EUR14.50 to EUR21.

Ryanair "quite upset" with ongoing B737 MAX delays

Ryanair Holdings is "quite upset" with Boeing and does not "necessarily believe" the manufacturer's assertion that 
its B737-8-200 will start deliveries by the end of the month, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said during a quarterly 
earnings presentation. "We are now being told the first delivery will be in late May. I am not sure we necessarily 
believe that. 
As the management team in Seattle continues to mismanage that process I think there is a real risk we might not 
see any of these aircraft in advance of summer 2021," O'Leary stressed. The extended-capacity variant of the 
B737-8 was certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in late March 2021. The European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) validated the type certificate in early April, theoretically paving the way for the 
commencement of deliveries. The Irish low-cost carrier initially hoped to receive the first units by the end of April 
2021. In its quarterly earnings release, Ryanair Holdings said the first B737-8-200 delivery remained formally 
scheduled for the end of May with a total of 60 due before the peak of the summer season. Ryanair is one of only 
two customers for the higher-capacity MAX 8 variant alongside Viet Nam's VietJetAir (VJ, Hanoi). However, the 
Irish holding is a much larger customer with 210 units on firm order from Boeing while VietJetAir has only twenty-
eight on order. While Ryanair Holdings has yet to specify where it will place its B737-8-200s insofar as specific 
group units are concerned, at least six of the early deliveries will be operated by Poland's Buzz. Some aircraft are 
also expected to be operated by Ryanair UK and Malta Air. Although Ryanair Holdings does not have firm orders 
for any other B737 MAX aircraft, the group's chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, said it was still in talks with Boeing 
about an order for B737-10s. He stressed that in line with past orders placed by Ryanair, the potential deal would 
be sizeable, but underlined that the two parties were "not quite there on price yet".

The pandemic has hit travel more heavily than any other sector. But the financial markets have deemed wellrun, 
low-cost European airlines to be winners in the recovery. Leading that pack is Ryanair, which said net losses of 
(EURO)815m over the past year were its largest ever yesterday.
Those were of little concern to investors. They have pushed Ryanair shares ever higher since vaccine 
breakthroughs last year.
The Irish group's efficiency and its strong balance sheet should allow it to take market share and capitalise on fast-
growing new markets.
Ryanair plans to expand while rivals such as easyJet are scaling back. Shares at 13 times three-year earnings are 
at the top of the past decade's range. A return to pre-pandemic levels of flying, though, will take longer. Plans for 
vaccine passports would delay an already lacklustre recovery in regions where it is needed most.
Almost 150m passengers flew with Ryanair annually before the pandemic. Passenger numbers this year would be 
towards the lower end of estimates at between 80m and 100m, the company has confirmed. That might be enough 
to get the group back into the black.
Current analysts' consensus suggests a (EURO)115m net profit. Short-term predictions are exercises in guesswork 
as governments impose sporadic lockdowns.
Airline investors expect big things from eastern Europe. Fast economic growth, underpenetration of flights and a 
growing cohort of business travellers all play in the region's favour.
Ryanair : heir force Twitter : @FTLex
Ryanair is second in the region to Hungarian rival Wizz Air with a sixth of narrow-body market share.
Those pros need to be balanced against the constraints that health passports would impose. The EU's Digital 
Green Certificate could become a requirement for travel, for example. But almost two-fifths of Poles say they do not 
plan to get the jab.
Wizz Air's prospects are tied even closer to eastern European markets. Shares have kept up with Ryanair over the 
past year and also command a premium. Expect turbulence for both as travel restrictions evolve, with Ryanair the 
safer bet.

Hard landing Ryanair falls to worst loss in its history
Hard landing Ryanair falls to worst loss in its history

Ryanair slumped to the steepest annual loss in its 35-year history as the coronavirus crisis devastated international 
travel.
But Europe's largest low-cost carrier hopes an air travel recovery has already begun after an uptick in weekly 
bookings in the past month.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said demand for flights would bounce back in the summer and return 
to 80 or 90 per cent of pre-pandemic traffic volumes from October. "We see a very strong recovery of traffic subject 
to the continuing success of the vaccine rollout programme through summer 2021," he said.
The carrier described last year as the most challenging in history after Covid-19 restrictions led to an 80 per cent 
drop in passengers to 27.5m in the year ending in March, leading to a net loss of (EURO)815m. That was down 
from 148.6m passengers and a net profit of just over (EURO)1bn a year earlier.
Ryanair reiterated that passenger numbers this year would be at the lower end of an 80m-120m range in a sign that 
there was still a way to go to reach pre-pandemic levels.
In the first quarter from April to June, the airline expects to carry only 5m to 6m passengers.
But there have been signs of a recovery. Customer bookings tripled from 500,000 in the first week of April to more 
than 1.5m last week.
Hard landing Ryanair falls to worst loss in its history
Ryanair did not give any formal earnings guidance for the current financial year, but it said it was likely to come 
close to break-even.
Its shares closed down 2.4 per cent at (EURO)16.45 in London. Harry Dempsey See Lex

Aviation bosses called on the government to further ease travel restrictions before the summer season as 
thousands of holidaymakers flew out of the UK yesterday after the latest lifting of coronavirus restrictions.
Airports recorded a small rise in the number of travellers after the partial lifting of tight border rules, removing a 
months-long ban on international leisure travel.
But travellers are able to visit only a handful of destinations, such as Portugal and Gibraltar, without quarantining on 
their return.
There was a steady trickle of passengers inside Heathrow Terminal 5's cavernous check-in area yesterday 
morning, normally the busiest time of the week. The airport was expecting 11,000 departing passengers, more than 
in recent weeks but just 10 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.
"It is a slow and steady start to travel, but just the fact it is legal again to get on a plane is transformational," said 
John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's chief executive.
It was a similar picture at other airports, with the number of people flying still a fraction of what it would normally be 
at the beginning of the peak tourist season.
"It's a small step but it's an important one," said Sean Doyle, British Airways chief executive. His airline had 80 
flights scheduled yesterday, about a tenth of normal levels. At Gatwick airport there were 57 flights scheduled, a 
measure of relief after falling to about a dozen during lockdown this year, but down from 838 on the same day in 
2019.
Back in the air Aviation chiefs urge longer 'green list'
A Ryanair flight to Faro in Portugal at 6am marked East Midlands airport's first passenger flight in six months, while 
5,000 passengers at Stansted was just 6 per cent of normal levels.
Doyle and Holland-Kaye both said that the US, large parts of Europe and the Caribbean should be added to the 
"green list" for travel in time for the summer holiday season.
But the government is preaching caution as concern grows over the spread of a Covid-19 variant first identified in 
India. Ministers have said people should not travel to countries on the "amber" list, which includes France, Spain 
and Italy.
The industry also wants ministers to publish a list of countries expected to be put on the "green list", to encourage 
more people to book a summer holiday, and to exempt vaccinated passengers from expensive testing on their 
return.
"We are not advocating for an immediate return to unrestricted travel but we can now responsibly allow travel to 
other low-risk destinations," Holland-Kaye said.
Having yearned for the return of passengers, airports are now worried about the potential for huge queues at 
immigration. Border Force officers are checking every returning passenger to verify Covid-related documents, 
including proof of a negative test. Holland-Kaye said he had received a personal assurance from Border Force that 
immigration queues would be manageable this summer. Philip Georgiadis Ryanair's worst loss page 12 Lex page

 Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) is expected to benefit from an oversubscribed five-year 
bond issuance to raise 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion), Reuters reported on Tuesday.
The report, which cited a memo from two lead managers, said the group will price the notes at 120 basis points 
over the mid-swap level, equivalent to a yield of around 0.98%, compared with 150 basis points at the start of the 
process, following demand of 5 billion euros.
The proceeds of the issuance will fund general corporate purposes, the report said.

May 18, 2021( Android Headlines: http://androidheadlines.com Delivered by Newstex)  Findings of a rather 
interesting study surfaced online, courtesy of pCloud[1]. This study revealed which popular apps[2] are most 
demanding, drain most battery, and take up most storage on your devices. The study doesn't mention a specific 
platform, so chances are it's for both iOS and Android. That being said, pCloud shared several different 
infographics, showing the most demanding apps in different ways.pCloud says Fitbit &#38; Verizon are the most 
demanding apps on your phone and memoryLet's talk about the most demanding apps on your phone and memory, 
shall we (image below the paragraph). The top two apps on this list are Fitbit and Verizon. 
pCloud claims that both apps permit 14 out of 16 available features to run in the background, and don't permit a 
dark mode to help save battery life.It is said that these features allow these apps to automatically sync updates, 
contacts, track your location, and run other demanding background tasks. Both of those apps have a score of 92-

Live, Facebook, and Airbnb follow them with 82-percent. Instagram is in eighth place with 79-percent, while a bunch 
of apps stand at 77-percent. The next infographic shows the top 20 most demanding apps. pCloud says that this 
test is based on 'a score of how much activity each app demands'. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube &#38; more 
permit a lot of extra features to run in the backgroundIt is said that, on average, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, 
YouTube, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn permit 11 extra features to run in the background. The source also says that 
features such as photos, WiFi, location, and the microphone all run in the background of the apps which demand 
more from your phone and battery. It is also said that apps such as Tinder, Bumble, and Grinder also allow on 
average of 11 features to run in the background. pCloud says that location tracking is one of the most demanding 
features that run in the background of all three dating apps.Study says that travel apps take up most storage 
spaceThe third infographic that got shared (image below), shows that travel apps take up most storage space. 
Travel and transportation apps such as United Airlines (437.8MB), Lyft (325.1MB), and Uber (299.6MB) take up 
quite a bit of storage space.Ryanair (109MB) and Jet2 (47.3MB) take up considerably less space. Microsoft Teams 
(232.2MB) is also quite demanding in that regard, while it is noted that Zoom (82.1MB) and Skype (111.2MB) are 
less demanding. The post Study Reveals Apps That Drain Most Battery &#38; Take Most Storage[3] appeared first

May 18, 2021( Bdaily Business News: http://bdaily.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  A North East airport has 
announced that it is launching a new slate of flights to Portugal following 'strong' sales for other destinations. 
Teesside Airport, in Darlington, has teamed up with Ryanair to launch a new twice-weekly service to Faro in 
Portugal's Algarve region. 
This comes less than two weeks after the country was added to the UK's green list for international travel, meaning 
that passengers will not need to quarantine on arrival back in the UK. The new route is the seventh service that 
Ryanair will be running from Teesside this summer, joining flights to Alicante, Palma and Corfu. Last week, fellow 
North East airport Newcastle International reported [1]that it would be starting flights to Portugal with airline British 
Airways. Jason McGuinness, Ryanair's commercial director, commented: 'We are very pleased to announce a new 
route from Teesside to Faro on the back of the UK's green list announcement. 'Teesside customers will now have 
the choice of four popular destinations this summer, with flights to Alicante, Faro and Palma de Mallorca from June, 
and Corfu from July. 'Teesside Airport continues to deliver efficient operations and competitive airport charges, 
allowing for long-term traffic growth and new routes. 'To celebrate this new Faro route, we are launching a seat sale 
with fares available from just 19.99, for travel from June until the end of October 2021, which must be booked by 
midnight Thursday, 20 May.' Ben Houchen, mayor of Tees Valley, said: 'This is fantastic news, and yet another vote 
of confidence in our airport. Of course, it has only been made possible because of the tremendous take-up of 
Ryanair's flights to Alicante and Palma by local people. 'Passengers are showing they're backing our airport and 
Ryanair is paying back their commitment in spades. Even before the first flight has taken off, Ryanair has listened to 
what people have been crying out for and doubled its routes to give them a much-needed break. 'We've been 
working hard over the past few months to transform our terminal, get it fit for the 21st century and make it easier 
and smoother than ever to pass through. 'We can't wait to welcome people back through our doors for these great 
summer breaks - and our growing slate of other domestic and international flights.'   Looking to promote your

May 18, 2021( GuruFocus.com: http://www.gurufocus.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The stock of Ryanair Holdings 
PLC (NAS:RYAAY[1], 30-year Financials[2]) is believed to be significantly overvalued, according to GuruFocus 
Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It 
is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at, the past business growth and analyst 
estimates of future business performance. 
If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be 
poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. At its 
current price of $113.62 per share and the market cap of $25.6 billion, Ryanair Holdings PLC stock appears to be 
significantly overvalued. GF Value for Ryanair Holdings PLC is shown in the chart below.Because Ryanair Holdings 
PLC is significantly overvalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business 
growth, which averaged 12.8% over the past five years.Link: These companies may deliever higher future returns at 
reduced risk.[3]Since investing in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss, 
investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at 
the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC has a cash-to-debt ratio[4] of 0.63, which ranks better than 67% of the companies in 
Transportation industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Ryanair Holdings PLC's financial strength as 4 out of 10, 
suggesting poor balance sheet. This is the debt and cash of Ryanair Holdings PLC over the past years: 
https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1430934/ryanair-holdings-plc-stock-is-believed-to-be-significantly-
overvaluedCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who 
may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company 
with lower profit margins. Ryanair Holdings PLC has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve 
months, the company had a revenue of $3.1 billion and loss of $6.801 a share. Its operating margin is -28.03%[5], 
which ranks worse than 88% of the companies in Transportation industry. Overall, the profitability of Ryanair 
Holdings PLC is ranked 8 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability. This is the revenue and net income of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC over the past years: https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1430934/ryanair-holdings-plc-stock-is-
believed-to-be-significantly-overvaluedGrowth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. 
GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's 
stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the 
growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate[6] of Ryanair Holdings PLC is 12.8%, which 
ranks better than 86% of the companies in Transportation industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -
Ryanair Holdings PLC Stock Is Believed To Be Significantly Overvalued
6.3%, which ranks worse than 71% of the companies in Transportation industry.Another method of determining the 
profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return 
on invested capital (ROIC)[7] measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has 
invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC)[8] is the rate that a company is expected to 
pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies 
the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Ryanair Holdings PLC's return on invested 
capital is -5.00, and its cost of capital is 8.36. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Ryanair Holdings PLC is 
shown below: https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1430934/ryanair-holdings-plc-stock-is-believed-to-be-significantly-
overvaluedIn closing, Ryanair Holdings PLC (NAS:RYAAY[9], 30-year Financials[10]) stock appears to be 
significantly overvalued. The company's financial condition is poor and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks 
worse than 71% of the companies in Transportation industry. To learn more about Ryanair Holdings PLC stock, you

May 18, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] incurred a loss (excluding 16 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.68 per share in the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2021 (ended Mar 31, 2021), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.65. Moreover, the 
amount of loss increased year over year. Results reflect coronavirus-induced disruptions to air-travel 
demand.However, quarterly revenues of $142.7 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $122.4 million. 
The top line plunged 89.2% year over year. Fiscal 2021 Results Ryanair's net loss came in at €815 million in fiscal 
2021 against a profit of €1 billion in the year-ago period. Amid coronavirus-led travel-demand woes, the airline 
regarded fiscal 2021 as the most 'challenging' in its 35-year history. Total revenues declined 81% year over year to 
€1.64 billion. Traffic dropped 81% year over year to 27.5 million due to travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed by 
several European governments. Load factor in the period was 71% compared with 95% in fiscal 2020. Ryanair

to significant decline in traffic. 
The airline's fuel costs declined 80% year over year due to reduced flying amid coronavirus-related fleet groundings 
as well as improved fuel burn. Total operating expenses declined 66% year over year. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks 
Rank #5 (Strong Sell), had cash of €3.15 billion at the end of Mar 31, 2021.You can see the complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[4]. Outlook Ryanair expects first-quarter fiscal 2022 traffic to be between 5 
million and 6 million guests. The airline anticipates its fiscal 2022 traffic to be in the low end of the previously-guided 
range of 80 million-120 million passengers. The carrier expects to benefit from pent-up demand for air travel in the 
second half of 2021 on hopes of successful vaccine roll outs and easing of European governments' travel 
restrictions. Consequently, it expects to break-even in fiscal 2022. On a further positive note, Ryanair hopes to 
return to pre-coronavirus levels of growth in summer 2022. Performance of Other Airline Stocks United Airlines 
UAL[5], carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), incurred a loss (excluding $3.21 from non-recurring items) of $7.5 per

May 18, 2021( FFT.ie: http://www.fft.ie Delivered by Newstex)  Is that the smell of hope in the air? Or is it just the 
pungent scent of quinine from yet another gin &#38; tonic - my lockdown anxiety-busting drink of choice. Despite 
the handwringing of certain members of the self-appointed moral police it seems we did drink less in 2020. Yes off-
trade sales increased but the fact that pubs and restaurants have been closed for most of the last 12 months has 
meant that sales figures for gin and other spirits are significantly down. 
Irish gin sales grew in 2019 by 4.6% (compared to 1.5% for whiskey and a 0.6% for vodka) but those growth figures 
were easily wiped out by the COVID 19 lockdowns. The closure of the on-trade meant less opportunities for 
consumers to experiment with the new, and of course no boisterous launches or on-site promotions, so the 
lockdowns have been kinder to established brands than new entrants. Oisn Davis of Great Irish Beverages believes 
that the pandemic has 'Taken its toll on those who wish to launch new gins'. It's not all bad news however - Oisn 
has seen a surge in consumers becoming at-home mixologists, something which plays into the hands of startup 
and smaller brands and distilleries. 'The lockdown has seen millions of people around the world upskill their 
domestic mixology. This has been channelled by clever brand education in the online realm - brands that did not 
focus on online in the last year are floundering at best or at worse, failing,' he said. Of the boom in hard seltzers and 
canned, RTD (ready to drink) cocktails, Oisn sees them as a mixed bag. 'Ready to drink mixes have definitely seen 
an increase, partly driven by the sudden growth of the hard seltzer category and the simplicity of the single serve 
G&#38;T in a can, perfect for al fresco socialising. However the quality of the canned gin &#38; tonics needs to be 
improved as some are just criminally awful and far too low in ABV,' he said. The pandemic has had one tiny positive 
for the gin world and that is the creation of a brand new gin called Runway28[1], named for Dublin Airport's main 
runway. Runway28 has an aviation theme with a picture of an old Dakota Passenger Plane on the label and is the 
creation of MarieAnn McLoughlin-Dwyer, a former air steward, and her partner who is a captain with 
Ryanair.MarieAnn has more recently worked in food product development for the aviation industry and supplying 
airline crew through Kilbarron Aviation, her Donegal based company. 'There are more than 50 Irish gins on the 
market but we think we have something different,' said MarieAnn. 'We wanted to put our pandemic downtime to 
good use and while we stuck to classic botanicals we have added a healthy kick of pepper to our gin which we 
created with Listoke Distillery in Louth.' Runway28 is gaining traction and is available in independent off-licences 
but MarieAnn hopes to focus more on travel retail, especially the 50ml miniature market for inflight service and 
possibly cruise ships. Another new entry is Stillgarden Distillery[2] who have really hit the ground running and 
Flying High Over Ireland 's Gin Scene
recently won best new distillery at the 2021 Irish Enterprise Awards. For Christmas 2020 they created a rather tasty 
Christmas gin with notes of plum pudding, and their latest gin product is a mid-strength Give and Take gin which at 
22% is aimed at the trend towards lower alcohol drinks. Stillgarden are based in Inchicore and was created by 
Vickie Baird and her partner Pat O'Brien. They have been hugely creative in the last 18 months. Many of their 
botanicals are grown by a team of volunteer 'Social Botanists' in their community garden in Inchicore. Locals are 
encouraged to return their empties to be refilled and receive discounts and as well as gin they have a new Aperol 
style drink on the way, and cocktail pouches in recyclable tetra packs. Established brands have not sat still over the 
past year either. Blackwater now have a mail-order club with a new gin every two months plus a fun spirit - their 
limoncello was one of the best things I tasted in 2020. In April 2021 Gunpowder released a Sardinian Citrus version 
of their hugely successful gin (which sells more than any other sku in Dublin Airport). This new iteration is made 
with Citrus Monstruosa and has a distinct lemon-grapefruit tang. Another new gin you might have missed is 3 Sq. 
Miles Gin from the new distillery on Cape Clear Island - about time Ireland got in on the island distillery act. It's 
wonderful, infused with the usual botanicals but also fuschia flowers from the island which give it a distinct floral 
note, mixing nicely with the salt 'n pepper ozone notes. Expect more seasonal gins and boutique gins - soon every 
five star hotel in the country will have their own and probably most four star hotels too. As home cocktail making 
became the norm in 2020 expect more kits and pouches like the ones from Stillgarden. Expect canned G&#38;T to 
attempt a return (the jury is out on this) and expect more creativity mixed with the local. My final advice to anyone 
looking to create a new gin is to go to their local park and start sniffing things - it's doubtful, but there might be 
something there that hasn't yet been used as a botanical. [ 1]: https://www.runway28gin.com/ [ 2]:

Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) said bookings have picked up recently and it expects air travel to start to recover from the 
second half of this year.
"If, as is presently predicted, most European populations are vaccinated by Sept., then we believe that we can look 
forward to a strong recovery in air travel, jobs and tourism in H2 of the current fiscal year (FY22).
"The recent strong increases in weekly bookings since early April suggests that this recovery has already begun," 
the airline said alongside its annual results.
The Irish carrier posted a loss of (EURO)1.1bn (2020: (EURO)670mln profit) in the year to end-March 2021 as 
revenues over the year fell 81% to (EURO)1.64bn ((EURO)8.5bn) due to the impact of Coronavirus.
Going forward, Ryanair said this current quarter will be 'very curtailed' but from then on expects to benefit from a 
strong rebound of pent up travel demand through the second half of 2021 and to return to pre-COVID levels of 
growth in the summer of 2022.
Passenger traffic numbers in the year to March 2022 are still likely to be at the bottom end of its 80-120mln 
forecasts with the financial outcome only recovering to break even, it said, and to achieve this will require an easing 
of travel restrictions within Europe over the peak holiday period of July to September.
The airline added it remained committed to Boeing's troubled 737MAX aircraft, which it said would be a 
gamechanger for the airline with 4% more seats and lower fuel costs. Ryanair has 210 MAX's on order.
Ryanair looks towards summer recovery after losses top (EURO)1.1bn
Ryanair added it had (EURO)3.15bn of cash and liquidity at the end of March, which it said gives it one of the 
strongest balance sheets in the industry.

European Stocks End Largely Lower After Detection of New COVID-19 Variant in UK
European Stocks End Largely Lower After Detection of New COVID-19

 European shares ended largely lower on Monday after the detection of a SARS-CoV-2 "double mutant" variant in 
the UK, amid ongoing US inflation fears.
The French CAC 40 ended down 0.3%, the European STOXX 600 was marginally lower and the Swiss Market 
Index finished up 0.1%. Meanwhile, the German DAX slipped 0.1% at market close, while the UK FTSE 100 closed 
down 0.2%.
Germany's Robert Koch Institute on May 14 classified the UK as a COVID-19 risk area after the British nation 
detected the B.1.617.2 variant first identified in India, which the World Health Organization labelled as a "variant of 
concern." UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson cautioned that the variant's spread may impact the country's plans to 
ease COVID-19 restrictions, Reuters reported.
Meanwhile, the UK British Retail Consortium asked for urgent negotiations to start between supermarkets and UK 
and European Union officials to discuss plans for checks on UK food products arriving to Northern Ireland, Reuters 
reported.
The move follows news that the UK is said to be ready to introduce custom checks on UK food products traveling to 
the region following tensions with the European Union over the implementation of the protocol for the region, the 
BBC reported earlier on Monday.
On the economic front, the Italian consumer price index was up 0.4% in April 2021 compared with March 2021 and 
up 1.1% compared with April 2020, according to data by Istat. The result confirmed the preliminary estimates.
Among companies, Sanofi (SAN.PA) and GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) COVID-19 vaccine managed to induce strong 
immune responses among adults in a phase 2 study, which puts the delayed candidate on track for potential 
regulatory approval this year. Interim results of a trial involving 722 adults showed 95% to 100% efficacy after a 
European Stocks End Largely Lower After Detection of New COVID-19 Variant in UK
second injection in people aged 18 to 95, with no safety concerns. Shares in Sanofi and GSK ended up 1.1% and 
0.7%, respectively.
Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) said it swung to a loss in fiscal 2021, following the severe impact of the pandemic, as 
the budget airline cautiously expects a resumption in European travel this summer to help it reach a breakeven 
result in the next fiscal year. Ryanair closed 2.4% lower in London.

3.50pm: London market's performance mirrors the weather
The London stock market has somewhat mirrored London's weather today; a pleasant start, followed by heavy 
showers and then a traditional British tepid finish.
The FTSE 100 was up 6 points (0.1%) at 7,049 but the mid-cap FTSE 250 remained in the gloom, down 61 points 
(0.3%) at 22,275.
On a quiet day for gig company news, GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LON:GSK) rose 1.0% to 1,384.6p after it announced 
that the COVID-19 vaccine developed with French giant Sanofi SA demonstrated strong immune responses in mid-
stage trials.
Among the mid-caps, Diploma PLC (LON:DPLM) was 9.5% higher at 3,012p after raising full-year expectations 
after a stonking first-half performance.
Among the small caps, Vietnam Holding Ltd (LON:VNH) hardened 2.3% to 227p after its latest investor report.

2.43pm: Wall Street starts on the back foot
The main indices on Wall Street have opened in the red on Monday morning, following the example set earlier in 
the day by global markets.
Shortly after the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.04% at 34,369 while the S&P 500 
dropped 0.28% to 4,161 and the Nasdaq fell 0.76% to 13,327.
While the markets as a whole were trending lower, Discovery Channel owner Discovery Communications Inc 
(NASDAQ:DISCA) was an early winner, jumping 9.5% to US$39.02 after it agreed to a US$43bn merger deal with 
telecoms giant AT&T Inc (NYSE:T).
FTSE 100 back in credit
Back in London, the FTSE 100 had mostly recovered from its earlier slump and was down just 3 points at 7,040 at 
around 2.40pm.
2.00pm: BT sparks mini-rally
The Footsie has trimmed its losses, helped by a mini-surge in the share price of telecoms giant BT Group PLC 
(LON:BT.A).
The FTSE 100 was down 22 points (0.3%) at 7,021 but BT was defying the trend after Philip Jansen, the chief 
executive of the company, spent just over £2mln to buy 1.25mln of the company's shares.
Jansen paid 163p a share, and unlike recent additions to Jansen's BT shareholdings, these shares have not been 
awarded to him under the telecoms company's (telco) share plan but have been purchased with hard cash.
The purchase follows last week's announcement of plans to whittle away the company's massive pension deficit by 
2030 and to accelerate the rate at which it plans to roll out fibre to the premises (FTTP) broadband connections.
12.35pm: US equities set for a softer start
US markets are expected to take a step back when trading starts this afternoon.
Spread betting quotes point to the Dow Jones tumbling 120 points to 34,262m the S&P 500 shedding 14 points at 
4,160 and the Nasdaq 100 retreat 58 points to 13,335.
The big macroeconomic event today for US traders is the Empire Manufacturing Index for May, which is expected 
to dip to 24.0 from 26.3 in April.
"The US dollar is edging higher at the start of the week in risk-off trade. Rising Covid cases in Asia, weaker Chinese 
economic data and geopolitical troubles in the Middle East are lifting demand for the safe-haven greenback," wrote 
Sophie Griffiths at OANDA.
"Still, the US dollar move has been small as investors look ahead to the release of the latest FOMC minutes on 
Wednesday, particularly in the wake of the very mixed data recently.
"Weak retail sales on Friday reinforced expectations that the Fed will stick to its accommodative stance for longer. 
Furthermore, US consumer confidence held steady in April, reining in fears of higher inflation. Treasury yields 
edged back close towards the key 1.60% level. Any move higher in the US dollar is likely to be short-lived," she 
added.
In London, the FTSE 100 was down 47 points at 6,997, falling below the 7,000 level. One can only hope it is 
because the City's barrow boys are too busy down the old rub-a-dub celebrating the relaxation of lockdown 
restrictions to trade shares.
11.40am: Bitcoin rallies after Elon Musk's latest tweet
The Footsie seems to have got itself into a rut but it's all kicking off in the cryptocurrency world - again.
The FTSE 100 was down 33 points (0.5%) at 7,011, with losses limited by some support for retail stocks such as 
B&M European Retail SA (LON:BME), J Sainsbury PLC (LON:SBRY) and JD Sports Fashion PLC (LON:JD.).
"Once upon a time, traders used to watch Donald Trump's Twitter handle like hawks. Now it is Elon Musk's turn - 
especially for crypto traders," said Fawad Razaqzada at ThinkMarkets on the latest Bitcoin lurch.
"After Musk replied to a tweet implying that Tesla had sold or is selling its holding of Bitcoin, the digital currency 
tanked. BTC/USD fell to a low of almost $42K before it bounced sharply on yet another Tweet from Musk, in which 
he clarified that Tesla had not sold any of its Bitcoin holdings (yet?). A few of his other tweets confirmed what he 
FTSE 100 back in credit
had said previously i.e. that he's looking into other cryptocurrencies that use less than 1% of Bitcoin's energy and 
transaction but the damage may already be done - and not just for Bitcoin."
The Bitcoin price has recovered by US$996 to US$45,058, boosting the net worth of numerous ransomware 
gangsters across the world.

"Tesla's decision to suspend Bitcoin payments on environmental concerns is a hammer blow for the digital currency 
and there is a risk that other big companies who have adopted Bitcoin may follow suit given how sensitive the issue 
of carbon footprint has become," Razaqzada said.
Meanwhile, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has published its latest data on homeworking in the UK labour 
market.
In 2020 25.9% of those in employment worked at home at some point in the survey reference week, up from 12.4% 
in 2019, the ONS revealed.
The groups with the highest rates of homeworking in 2020 were women, those working in information and 
communication, those residing in or working in London and those in professional occupations, it added.
10.00am: Putting the down into lockdown
After a steady start, London's index of leading shares has dipped as investors take note of the rising rate of COVID-
19 infections in Asia.
The FTSE 100 was down 18 points (0.3%) at 7,026, with aerospace-related stocks back on the naughty step, 
especially aeroplane engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LON:RR.), which is down 2.6% at 104.82p, and 
British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines SA (LON:IAG), which is down 1.6% at 193.76p.
Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) defied the trend, rising 1.0% to (EURO)17.03 after it said 
bookings have picked up recently and it expects air travel to start to recover from the second half of this year.
READ Ryanair looks towards summer recovery after losses top (EURO)1.1bn
The airline's full=year results were slightly ahead of Peel Hunt's forecasts.
"Ryanair reiterates that it expects FY22E to be close to breakeven, although it states that this is a cautious 
estimate, and we do not expect to change our (EURO)76m net profit forecast significantly," the broker said.
Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered PLC (LON:STAN) is also reacting negatively to trends in Asia, with the 
shares off 1.7% at 498.4p.
Concerns that relaxation of lockdown rules might have to be rescinded back here in Blighty are sapping support for 
the likes of hotels owner Whitbread PLC (LON:WTB) and contract caterer Compass Group PLC (LON:CPG); the 
former is down 1.8% at 3,124p and the latter is 1.5% weaker at 1,516.5p.
Considering a lot more pubs will be opening the doors today than did so yeaterday, pubs stocks are not attracting 
much interest. Marston's PLC (LON:MARS) is down 1.2% at 98.8p and Mitchells & Butlers PLC (LON:MAB) is 1.9% 
weaker at 309.8p.

"Despite last-minute fears concerning the Indian variant, England entered stage three of its reopening today and 
there may now be some customers have been in the pub for seven hours already," said Langton Capital, a 
specialist on the pubs, bars, hotels and restaurants sector.
"The BBPA [British Beer and Pub Association] reported ahead of the date that 45,000 pubs would reopen 'serving 3 
million pints on Monday, but 2,000 pubs will remain closed.' It says all restrictions must be removed on June 21st 
for all pubs to reopen and be given a chance of survival," Langton Capital noted.
"The BBPA points out that 'pubs and other parts of the hospitality sector will still face heavy restrictions compared to 
normal. They will be required to ensure 1 metre plus social distancing is in place, operate by table service only and 
ensure that face masks are worn other than when sat at a table inside or if outdoors.' It estimates beer sales will be 
'65% - some 1.6 million pints - lower than a normal Monday pre-pandemic. This is below the break-even point for 
the majority of pubs, who cannot trade profitably whilst the current restrictions remain in place," Langton added.
 On Monday 17th May, we expect: 45,000 UK pubs to reopen, but 2,000 to stay closed ???? 3 million pints to be 
served, 65% less than normal ???? ????ALL restrictions must be removed in pubs by 21st June for them to survive 
and trade viably https://t.co/zNT40hPPVq - British Beer & Pub Association (@beerandpub) May 14, 2021
8.40am: Heavy dose of caution
The FTSE 100 opened modestly higher as a further easing of lockdown restrictions provided some cheer.
It followed a mixed opening to the week in Asia with the main markets there consumed by China's conflicting 
economic messages.
While retail sales wildly undershot expectations, industrial output from the world's second-largest economy 
remained resilient.
Inflation fears continued to bubble in the background, particularly after the most recent forecasts by the University of 
Michigan, which prompted a brief spike in the 10-year Treasury yield and rises in demand for gold.
Here at home, the focus was on the pub sector, with some hostelries opening on the stroke of midnight to host 
drinkers who can now consume alcohol and food indoors after previously having to freeze under patio lamps.
The message from Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was "use a heavy dose of caution" when exercising new-found 
freedoms.
His words were no doubt prompted by the rise in cases of the super-infectious Indian Covid variant.
On the markets, the precious metals groups Polymetal (LON:POLY) and Fesnillo (LON:FRES) tracked the gold 
price higher. They were up 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the early exchanges.
Record losses from Ryanair (LON:RYA) had largely been anticipated as the budget airline's stock rose 1.5% 
following its annual results.
"There are glimmers spots of hope emerging such as the strong increases in weekly bookings since early April," 
said Susannah Streeter, market analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
"The accelerating roll-out of vaccine programmes across Europe is giving the airline more confidence that there 
should be a rebound in business in the second half of the year. In the best-case scenario, with a surge in bookings, 
the company said it should break even this year."
Industrial parts group Diploma (LON:DPLM) opened 10% higher after telling the market its profits would be ahead 
of market expectations.
6.50 am: Drinkers raise an early glass
FTSE 100 back in credit
The FTSE 100 looks set to start in positive territory after a mixed session in Asia earlier.
Sentiment in the region was weighed down by Chinese retail sales data, which undershot expectations; however, 
industrial output from the world's second-largest economy remained resilient.
Demand for gold spiked as Friday's batch of economic data from the University of Michigan on Friday effectively 
raised the threat level for inflation.
The spectre of higher interest rates briefly pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to a six-week high.
"In an extremely fickle environment markets are continuing to wrestle with the dilemma as to whether the current 
bout of rising inflation prints is transitory in nature or a harbinger of a much more persistent trend of price 
increases," said Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets.
Raise a glass
Here at home, Monday is all about a further lifting of Covid restrictions, including the ban on indoor drinking 
witnessed by the opening of some pubs from midnight on.
The relaxation may prompt traders to re-look at the recovery stocks including those in the out-of-fashion hospitality 
and holiday sectors.
This week both Ryanair (LON:RYA) and easyJet (LON:EZJ) will provide their assessment of the international travel 
market when they update on trading.
Also reporting are telco Vodafone (LON:VOD), tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON:IMB), Royal Mail (LON:RMG)

Ryanair reports full year loss of €815m as traffic falls 81%
Ryanair reports full year loss of €815m as traffic falls 81%

Ryanair has today announced that the financial year of 2021 was the most challenging year in its 35 year history. 
The airline said Covid-19 saw traffic collapse, almost overnight, from 149m to just 27.5m as many European 
Governments imposed flight bans, travel restrictions and national lockdowns. 
There was a partial recovery during summer 2020, as initial lockdowns eased, however a second Covid-19 wave in 
Europe followed quickly in the autumn with a third wave in spring. Ryanair expects intra-European air travel 
capacity to be materially lower for the foreseeable future and that this will create opportunities to extend airport 
growth incentives, as the Group takes delivery of 210 new (lower cost) Boeing 737s. 
Ryanair says it is encouraged by the recent release of multiple Covid-19 vaccines and hopes that the rollout will 
facilitate the resumption of intra-Europe air travel and tourism this summer. If, as is presently predicted, most 
European populations are vaccinated by September, then Rynair believes that it can look forward to a strong 
recovery in air travel, jobs and tourism in the second half of the current fiscal year (FY22). Ryanair says the recent 
strong increases in weekly bookings since early April suggests that this recovery has already begun.
In a statement today, Ryanair said, "Since March 2020, the Group has lowered cash burn by cutting costs, 
participating in EU Govt. payroll support schemes, cancelling share buybacks and deferring non-essential capex.  
Over the past year, the Group successfully raised c.€1.95bn in new finance (incl. €400m share placing, €850m 
eurobond and &pound;600m CCFF) and cash was further boosted by supplier reimbursements during the year.  
This financial strength enables the Group to capitalise on the many growth opportunities that will be available post 
Covid-19."

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary says he is seeing the start of a strong rebound for travel as the easing of lockdown 
releases pent-up demand.
Europe's biggest budget airline revealed the scale of the coronavirus collapse in travel - an (EURO)815m (£702m) 
loss and traffic down 81% in the year to March on the previous 12 months.
But Mr O'Leary said there were signs the "recovery has already begun".
Bookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now.
"The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence," he told the BBC. "We are very optimistic for 
the next couple of months."
And he predicted that after "most European populations are vaccinated by September", the airline should see a 
particularly strong recovery in October to March, the second half of its financial year.
"For vaccinated Britons going to the beaches of Portugal, Spain and Greece, I think there is very little risk. 
Everybody is right to be cautious, but I think everybody can take their holiday in Europe with a high degree of 
confidence."
From Monday, holidaymakers from England, Scotland and Wales can fly off for some early summer sun as the ban 
on foreign holidays is lifted.
Travellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating 
on their return.
But the vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine 
when they get back.
Mr O'Leary told BBC Breakfast that the air travel sector was offering some "good deals" for this summer as it tried 
to kick-start demand after a torrid year.
Ryanair boss O'Leary sees the start of a strong rebound for travel
But he forecast prices would rise in 2022. With the collapse and contraction of airlines like Thomas Cook and 
Alitalia reducing capacity, carriers will be able to push up prices, he said.
The scale of the financial crisis facing airlines was underlined on Monday when Ryanair posted a record after-tax 
loss. The airline said it flew 27.5 million passengers in the year ending 31 March, down from 149 million the 
previous year.
Ryanair's annual (EURO)815m loss was slightly better than an (EURO)834m loss forecast by many analysts.
"It's better than we predicted, but still a fairly traumatic loss for an airline that has been consistently profitable for our 
35-year history," Mr O'Leary said in a pre-recorded statement accompanying the results.

Ryanair reported a record annual loss on Monday and said it would at best break even in the coming year as it 
navigates huge uncertainty around the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and how much travel-starved passengers will 
pay for summer flights.
Europe's largest discount airline said the pandemic had made the 12 months to the end of March the most 
challenging in its history, forcing it to slash capacity by 80% and shed 1,000 jobs.
And while it has seen a "dramatic springback in bookings" in recent weeks, it has almost zero visibility for the rest of 
the year, Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
"The likely outturn... is that we are looking at something between a very small loss and break-even for the next 12 
months but there are a lot of moving parts and there is a lot of uncertainty," O'Leary said in a video presentation.
"Most of the uncertainty revolves around the timing of the recovery and the fares that people will pay into the key 
June, July, August, September travel period," he said.
The airline reported a record annual after-tax loss of 815 million euros ($989 million) in its financial year to March 
31, slightly better than the forecast loss of 834 million euros in a company poll of analysts.
"It's better than we predicted, but still a fairly traumatic loss for an airline that has been consistently profitable for our 
35-year history," O'Leary said.
Ryanair flew 27.5 million passengers to the end of March down from 149 million the previous year. O'Leary said his 
current estimate is that the airline would fly between 80 and 100 million in the year to March 31, 2022.

Duvignau
The airline is likely to fly just 5-6 million passengers in its April-June quarter, usually one of its busiest.
The relaxation of travel restrictions in the United Kingdom has seen bookings triple in five weeks from 500,000 to 
1.5 million per week, he said.
Ryanair posts record annual loss
O'Leary also expressed confidence that the airline would come out of the pandemic with a significantly reduced cost 
base due to cuts in wages, more efficient new aircraft and lower airport costs.
The airline has in recent months secured extensions on low-cost growth deals with key bases London Stansted, 
Milan Bergamo and Brussels Charleroi, he said.
Ryanair also reported additional delays in the delivery of its first 737 MAX aircraft, which it said may not arrive until 
after its peak summer period, but there was no indication they delay would have any impact on capacity.
O'Leary said he was "quite upset" with Boeing over the delays, related to a recent electrical grounding issue, but 
that he was still in talks about a possible new order for the larger, 230-seat MAX 10.
Ryanair shares were up 0.8% at 17.05 euros at 0730 GMT. ($1 = 0.8244 euros)

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, landed deep in the red in the past fiscal year due to the impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic on passenger numbers.
Ryanair posted a loss of 815 million euros (989 million dollars) over the 12 months that ended March 31, compared 
to a profit of just over 1 billion euros in the same period a year earlier, chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a 
presentation on Monday.
The airline's passenger traffic fell 81 per cent over the previous year, to 27.5 million.
For the current fiscal year, management believes in a result close to the break-even point, but would not risk a 
concrete forecast due to continuing uncertainty around the pandemic.
However, the overall expectation was that vaccination campaigns will be successful in Europe and governments will 
lift travel restrictions in time for the all-important summer season starting in July.
Looking forward to the next 12 months, Ryanair sees a rebound in traffic in the second half of the year and expects 
total passenger numbers for the period to be at the lower end of its issued target range of 80 million to 120 million 
passengers.
In the current first fiscal quarter to the end of June, the figure is expected to be just 5 to 6 million.

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its loss attributable to equity holders of 
parent was 1.02 billion euros or 0.9142 euros per share compared to profit of 648.7 million euros or 0.5793 euros 
per share in the prior year.
 Annual revenue fell by 81% to 1.64 billion euros from last year. Due to an 81% reduction in traffic and aircraft 
delivery delays, the Group recorded a 200 million euros, ineffectiveness charge on fuel and currency hedges in 
fiscal year 2021.
 Looking for fiscal year 2022, the company expects continues to be challenging, with uncertainty around when and 
where Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions will be eased.
 The Group expects first-quarter traffic to be heavily curtailed to between 5 million and 6 million guests.
 The company said that fiscal year 2022 traffic is likely to be towards the lower end of its previously guided range of 
80 million to 120 million passengers.
 The company also cautiously believes that the likely outcome for fiscal year 2022 is currently close to breakeven - 
assuming that a successful rollout of vaccines this summer allows a timely easing of European Government travel 
restrictions on intra-European traffic in time for the peak travel period of July/August/September.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a loss in its most recently ended financial year but it 
expects an improvement as coronavirus restrictions ease. 
The Irish budget airline said it swung to a loss for the year to the end of March of EUR1.11 billion from EUR648.7 
million profit recorded the year before. 
Annual revenue fell 81% year-on-year to EUR1.64 billion from EUR8.49 billion, in line with the fall in traffic to just 
27.5 million from 148.6 million the year prior. Load factor declined to 71% from 95% year-on-year. 
Ancillary revenue delivered a solid performance as more guests chose priority boarding and reserved seating, 
resulting in an 11% increase in per passenger spend to almost EUR22. Ancillary revenue is generated from non-
ticket sources, such as baggage fees and on-board food and services. 
Due to an 81% reduction in traffic and aircraft delivery delays, the company said it recorded a EUR200 million 
ineffectiveness charge on fuel and currency hedges in its most recently ended financial year.
Going forward, Ryanair said its current financial year continues to be challenging, with uncertainty around when and 
where Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions will be eased. 
Looking ahead, the company said it expects first-quarter traffic to be between 5 million and 6 million guests. It also 
believes that annual traffic is likely to be towards the lower end of its previously guided range of 80 million to 120 
million passengers, which would represent a jump of up to four times year-on-year.

May 17, 2021( Financial Press: https://financialpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  European stocks edged lower on 
Monday, as investors weighed signs that COVID-19 infections are continuing to spread in Asia, even as fears about 
inflation appear to have subsided. After easing 0.5% last week, the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, -0.32%[1] slipped 
0.2%. U.S. stock futures ES00, -0.44%[2] also were perched lower.After a week of intense debate about inflation,

previous Monday. 'Some mixed activity data from China are a reminder that even that economy is not fully through 
the pandemic's effects,' said Ian Williams, strategist at U.K. broker Peel Hunt. 
Retail sales and industrial production in China both rose slower than expectations in April. A number of Asian stock 
markets, most notably Japan NIK, -0.92%[4] and Taiwan Y9999, -2.99%[5], dropped on worrying coronavirus

May 17, 2021( Financial Press: https://financialpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair slumped to its biggest 
annual loss in its 35-year history, as the COVID-19 pandemic grounded aircraft and upended international travel, 
but it said it is likely to break even this year, as vaccination rollouts facilitate the return of air travel. The Irish budget 
carrier said that although bookings had jumped significantly from a very low base since the beginning of April, 
forward visibility remains 'close to zero,'[1] making it 'impossible' to provide more meaningful financial 
guidance.Shares in Ryanair RYA, +1.22%[2] RY4C, +0.68%[3] RYAAY, +1.20%[4] were up 0.71% in early 
European trading on Monday. The stock has risen 3.19% in the year to date, according to data from FactSet. 
The airline swung to an €815 million ($990 million) loss in the 12 months to March 31, compared with a €1 billion 
profit in the previous year, after passenger numbers plunged 81% from 149 million passengers, to just 27.5 million 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. It reiterated that passenger numbers in the year to March 31, 2022 would be at the 
lower end of an 80 million to 120 million range. In the first quarter from April to June, it expects to fly just five million 
to six million passengers, as some governments keep their borders shut. Read: EU proposes reopening external 
borders as vaccination campaigns pick up speed[5] Describing the past financial year as the 'most challenging' in its 
history, Ryanair blamed European governments for 'constantly changing' guidelines, which left it to deal with the 
fallout as millions of customers requested flight changes and refunds. 'There was a partial recovery during summer 
2020, as initial lockdowns eased, however a second COVID-19 wave in Europe followed quickly in the autumn with 
a third wave in spring,' Ryanair said in a statement[6]. 'This created enormous disruptions and uncertainty for both 
our customers and our people, as they suffered constantly changing Govt. guidelines, travel bans and restrictions,' 
the company added. However, Ryanair struck a note of optimism, saying it expects to benefit from a strong rebound 
of pent-up travel demand through the second half of the year, and said it looks forward to returning to growth in 
summer 2022. The weekly increase in bookings since early April suggests a recovery has already begun, it added. 
Jack Winchester, an analyst at Third Bridge, said Ryanair, like ultra-low-cost peer Wizz Air WIZZ, -0.96%[7], 
weathered the crisis far better than its legacy counterparts. 'It also stands ready to hoover up the pent-up demand 
for foreign holidays we're about to see as rules on international travel finally ease. 'While Lufthansa LHA, -0.54%[8], 
IAG IAG, -0.99%[9] and Air France KLM AF, +0.11%[10] all struggled under the weight of huge hub-and-spoke 
airline operations, Ryanair's point-to-point model meant it was able to adapt faster and more fully to a historic year 
of low demand,' Winchester added. Read: U.K. excitement over reopening clouded by worries over Indian

variant[11] Ryanair said it was encouraged by the production of multiple COVID-19 vaccines, adding that it hopes 
their rollouts will facilitate the return of intra-Europe air travel and tourism this summer. 'If, as is presently predicted, 
most European populations are vaccinated by Sept., then we believe that we can look forward to a strong recovery 
in air travel, jobs and tourism in H2 of the current fiscal year (FY22),' the company said. It also expects to benefit 
from a reduced fleet cost over the next decade as it takes delivery of aerospace companyBoeing's BA, +2.62%[12] 
37 'Gamechanger' aircraft, which it believes will improve revenue with 4% more seats while substantially reducing 
unit costs, especially fuel. This will also be helped by its new bases, including those in Billund, Stockholm and 
Zagreb, the company said. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould noted that, despite swinging to a big loss in 
2020, 'Ryanair has kept its eye on the longer-term prize and recently increased an order for B737-8200 
Gamechanger aircraft in a bid to have an advantage over rivals, as these planes have more seats and lower fuel 
burn and noise emissions.' The post : Ryanair posts biggest annual loss in its 35-year history, but airline sees

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) on Thursday reported a loss for fiscal 2021 as pandemic-related travel 
restrictions led to lower passenger traffic.
Loss attributable to equity holders amounted to 1.02 billion euros ($1.23 billion), or a loss per share of 0.9142 euro, 
reversing an attributable profit of 648.7 million euros, or 0.5793 euro, a fiscal year earlier.
Total operating revenue declined to 1.64 billion euros from 8.49 billion euros as passenger traffic for the fiscal year 
fell 81% following pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions.
Looking ahead, Ryanair expects passenger traffic to be at the lower end of the 80 million to 120 million range for 
fiscal 2022. 
Additionally, the budget airline currently anticipates fiscal 2022 results to be close to breakeven, contingent on the 
successful completion of vaccinations this summer.
Ryanair's shares gained over 1% in London at the end of May 14.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) is "quite upset" with Boeing (BOE.L, BOEI.BR) due to delays in the delivery of the 737 
MAX aircraft, Reuters reported Monday, citing Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary added that the aircraft manufacturer expects to start the deliveries in late May, but noted that he did not 
have confidence in the deliveries to take place in the summer due to mismanagement.
The company was originally scheduled to receive 40 aircraft before summer, which was later reduced to 16.
Shares of both Ryanair and Boeing were up marginally on Monday morning.

May 17, 2021( Financial Buzz: http://www.financialbuzz.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (OTCMKTS: RYAOF), 
an Irish low-cost airline, recently experienced a rise in bookings, meanwhile reporting its biggest annual loss in the 
company's 35-year existence due to Covid. 
The airline reported a full-year net loss of USD989 Million as travel restrictions and lockdowns cut its traffic down by 
81%. CEO, Michael O'Leary revealed it has been a 'Very difficult year,' but assured that the company is 'looking 
forward with tremendous optimism.' 'In the first week of April, we took just under half a million bookings. Six weeks 
later, last week, we took 1.5 million bookings. So we are seeing a very strong snap back in bookings; travel 
beginning to start from June, July, August,' O'Leary said. 'I think if these trends continue we will be looking 
reasonably optimistic towards a very strong second quarter of traffic recovery.' The company is hopeful that 
increasing vaccine doses will aid in the recovery. Ryanair expects to break even in the upcoming year, if all goes 
well. 'FY22 (full fiscal year 2022) continues to be challenging, with uncertainty around when and where Covid 
lockdowns and travel restrictions will be eased,' it said in a release Monday. Ryanair anticipates traffic to range 
between 80 Million and 120 Million passengers in March of 2022.

Ryanair announces a US$989 million loss and apparently, things are getting better!
This week is apparently the beginning of the recovery, at least for the UK market and subsequently most of Europe. 
Holidaymakers should be returning to the beaches of Spain, Greece and Turkey; unfortunately, all three failed to 
make the "Green List" leaving Portugal as the winner by default! If this is the beginning of the recovery, then 
Ryanair for one will be delighted having just announced a loss of US$ 989 million; things can only get better, can't 
they?

       U.K. stocks fell on Monday after last week's rollercoaster ride. A firmer pound weighed on markets as Britain 
took a big step towards reopening its economy, lifting a number of social restrictions imposed to combat the 
COVID-19 outbreak.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 dropped 22 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,022 after rising 1.2 percent on Friday.
 Diploma Plc shares surged 8 percent. The seal and cables maker reinstated dividend and upped its annual 
guidance after a very strong first-half performance.
 GSK shares were modestly lower. The drugs giant and France's Sanofi have reported "strong immune responses" 
in early tests of their COVID-19 vaccine.
 Ryanair Holdings gained 0.7 percent. After posting a record annual loss, the discount carrier pointed to a strong 
recovery in the second half.

Why do airline pilots wear a uniform?

May 16, 2021( The Hindu Business Line: http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Flying an 
aircraft is similar to commanding a ship. It is important that passengers know who is in control of the craft. 
The flight crew needs to command respect and authority from passengers, especially during emergency situations. 
Hence, for airlines to distinguish the crew from ordinary passengers, pilots were made to wear customised 
uniforms.But it wasn't always so. Before the 1930s, they would turn up in brown leather bomber jackets, silk 
scarves, gloves, khaki pants, boots and so on. The pilots came equipped with such heavy gear to protect 
themselves from harsh weather conditions as cockpits at the time were left open and unheated.This changed after 
Pan American Airlines introduced navy-style apparel, according to a flight training company, AeroGuard. Today, 
cockpits are inside aircraft, and the uniforms are modern and smart.According to FlightDeckFriend.com, each airline 
has a unique uniform design for its pilots, some more subtle than others, though generally similar.What does the 
uniform consist of?A typical pilot uniform consists of a jacket which is usually decorated with the airline's wings to 
help identify the individuals as pilots. A name badge is also included along with stripes to indicate the rank of the 
pilots, FlightDeckFriend.com says. Four stripes indicate the rank of a Captain; three for a Senior First Officer; two 
for the First Officer. There are some variations on this depending on the airline. There are also variations in airlines 
on the qualifications deemed necessary for the ranks — in some cases a position depends on the time served, 
whereas in some others, it may be based on total hours of flight time. The additions to the jacket — wings, name 
badge and rank indicators (through epaulettes) are usually also found on the pilot's shirt.The material of the 
trousers usually matches that of the jacket. Shoes are typically plain black, made of leather and without any intricate 
patterns.Why do pilots wear caps?Head gear is not a part of all airline uniforms. Pilots in low-cost airlines such as 
Ryanair and easyJet do not wear caps, but aviators in most legacy carriers such as British Airways, Qantas, 
Emirates and American Airlines do.Many believe that caps, like a uniform, draw recognition, authority and denote 
professionalism. (Sources: AeroGuard; flightdeckfriend.com. Compiled by K Giriprakash)

Airlines, tobacco and telecoms among key sectors in coming week, UK inflation data to provide macro flavour
Airlines, tobacco and telecoms among key sectors in coming week, UK 
inflation data to provide macro flavour

The coming week is scheduled to see updates and results from a plethora of blue-chip brands, with Ryanair and 
easyJet representing the airline sector while tobacco group Imperial Brands, telecoms giant Vodafone and Royal 
Mail among the notable reporters.
However, other major brands are also in the pipeline including B&Q owner Kingfisher, publisher group Future and 
utility firm National Gird, while in the macro diary UK inflation data will be the headline news alongside new 
unemployment figures.
Airlines taxi to the results runway
Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) and easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) respectively report full-year results 
on Monday and half-year numbers on Thursday, with tough reading expected for investors in both due to the near-
total shutdown of international travel in the pandemic, meaning cash burn will be one of the key issues for both 
companies.
Easyjet's shares, after falling from around 1500p to below 500p last year, have rebounded above 1000p, while 
Ryanair's at above (EURO)16 are higher than they were in early 2020 as investors anticipate it grabbing more 
market share in the fallout from the pandemic.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) also had a nervous time recently when it was revealed that Boeing's 737 MAX 
aeroplanes were grounded again after technical problems were found, less than six months after being cleared to 
Airlines, tobacco and telecoms among key sectors in coming week, UK inflation data to provide macro flavour
return to the skies following two fatal crashes which forced regulators to suspend their operation in March 2019. 
Ryanair is a major customer of Boeing and has dozens of these fuel-efficient planes on order.
While this latest issue was cleared up fairly quickly, Ryanair's problems are far from over, with restrictions on 
foreign holidays still in place for most countries in Europe, with the UK's 'green list' for quarantine free travel only 
including Portugal on the continent and unlikely summer beach vacation locations such as Iceland, Gibraltar and 
the Faroe Islands.
Ryanair said last month that it expects to report a full-year loss of (EURO)800-850mln, having carried 27.5mln 
passengers compared to 149mln, though it had more than (EURO)3.1bn of cash as of the end of March and 84% of 
the fleet unencumbered.
For the new year, boss Michael O'Leary was eyeing passenger volumes to be at the lower end of the 80-120mln 
range.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "Ryanair was banking 
on a vaccine led recovery to save the summer season but the limited number of green light destinations on the 
holiday list so far will be highly disappointing. Although Ryanair is used to belt-tightening, it is unlikely it will be able 
to withstand a further squeeze on revenues, if bookings don't resume briskly over coming months the company may 
be forced to return to the market to drum up more financial support."
As for easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) on Thursday, these interims follow a statement last month where it guided to a pre-
tax loss of £690-730mln and said it had liquidity of roughly £2.9bn.
Broker Peel Hunt said it believes this amount of cash "should be more than sufficient, as long as travel restrictions 
are eased over the course of the spring and summer and are not reintroduced over the next couple of years at 
least".
The FTSE 250-listed flier's holidays business is "a key differentiator" to other airlines, the analysts said, but the 
UK's progress on traffic light tiering, vaccine passports and PCR testing has been "disappointingly slow".
"Whilst progress on costs has been encouraging, this is unlikely to be enough to offset the challenges that further 
delays will bring."
Vodafone dials in with results
Vodafone PLC (LON:VOD) is not the sexy stock it was when it was sitting on a pile of Verizon Wireless shares but 
interest in the mobile phone networks operator has perked up recently.
Thursday's fourth-quarter (Q4) and full-year (FY) results should give some clues whether the revived interest is 
justified.
"We see scope for a gradual re-rating in the stock as top-line trends continue improving," said UBS.
The market is expecting fourth-quarter organic revenue growth of 0.6%, following on from growth of 0.4% in the 
third quarter and a 0.4% decline in the second quarter.
Analysts are braced for a 0.7% organic service revenue decline in Europe for the quarter after declines of 1.8% and 
1.1% in the second and third quarters, respectively.
Full-year adjusted underlying earnings (EBITDA) are expected to show organic growth of up to 1%, with the decline 
in roaming revenues as the result of travel restrictions responsible for the decline.
Imperial Brands hopes to spark interest with interims
Airlines, tobacco and telecoms among key sectors in coming week, UK inflation data to provide macro flavour
Investors in tobacco group Imperial Brands PLC (LON:IMB) are likely to be looking for reassurances in its half-year 
results on Tuesday as the company continues its portfolio transition.
The maker of Lambert & Butler has not seen its reduced-risk products do as well as its traditional items in recent 
years, so shareholders will likely be looking for any way the company plans to remedy this as the shift away from 
combustible products continues.
The company's views of the proposed ban on menthol cigarettes in the US will also be eyed closely, as well as how 
the firm plans to offset any potential impact.
In a pre-close trading statement on March 30, Imperial said it expects its first-half earnings (EBIT) to grow by at 
least mid-single digits, so the numbers will be watched to see how they align with predictions.
Analysts at Barclays said that if this target is hit Imperial will be "comfortably on track to hit its FY21 guidance of low 
mid-single digit EBIT growth".
Back to the Future
Magazine publisher Future PLC's (LON:FUTR) interim results on Wednesday are likely to make for positive viewing 
given the company reported a strong performance in its Media division, which accounts for 70% of revenues, in the 
first four months of the year.
The firm has been boosted by a shift towards online advertising during the pandemic, so investors will be hoping 
that the trends will continue across the rest of the year and beyond.
There will likely be less fanfare for the magazine side of the business, which has seen ad revenues in both print and 
digital fall sharply. With this in mind, investors will be hoping the situation has not degenerated further.
Meanwhile, there will be some interest in the company's shift towards its services offering, having acquired price 
comparison site GoCo in February, as well as whether it still expects its full-year profit to be "materially" ahead of 
previous market expectations.
Royal Mail posts final results
Final results from Royal Mail PLC (LON:RMG) on Thursday are expected to be a bumper affair as the company 
continues to benefit from the boom in ecommerce shopping sparked by the pandemic.
An upsurge in package demand, as well as a somewhat unexpected resurgence of letter writing, have helped lift the 
company's fortunes, however, the infrastructure of its UK business remains behind due to under-investment so 
shareholders will be looking for any insight on how much cash needs to be spent to bring it up to scratch.
The international business is also expected to be a bright spot, with the company targeting 12% annual revenue 
growth over the next five years for its GLS segment.
National Grid to experience few shocks in finals
Full-year results from National Grid PLC (LON:NG.) are unlikely to set the pulses racing but shareholders will 
expect more details on the company's "strategic portfolio repositioning".
This follows March's £7.8bn acquisition of UK-focused Western Power Distribution (WPD), which Berenberg 
reckons will enhance group earnings by over 15% once it beds in.
Repositioning the business with the WPD deal increases National Grid's focus on electricity networks to around 
70% of regulated asset value (RAV) and the UK to around 60% of group underlying earnings (EBIT).
Airlines, tobacco and telecoms among key sectors in coming week, UK inflation data to provide macro flavour
As a utility company, National Grid has a reliable revenue stream with which to service its debt but nevertheless, 
analysts will be keeping an eye out for the debt position; Berenberg reckons it could grow to an eye-watering 
£37.9bn by March 2024.
Kingfisher flies in with update
Try to get a patio heater or some gizmo designed to make socialising in the garden a bit more palatable and you 
probably won't be able to find one for love nor money, which bodes well for the fiscal first-quarter trading update 
from Kingfisher PLC (LON:KGF).
The DIY retailer, which owns the B&Q, Screwfix, Castorama and Brico Depot brands, has had a blindingly good 
pandemic, as householders have spent their time in lockdown improving their homes.
In March, Kingfisher reported a 7.2% rise in sales to £12.3bn in the year to end-January 2021, so that's the sales 
growth rate that it has to beat to keep traders interested in its shares.
The UK led the improvement with revenues rising 11%% with France 5% ahead.
"In terms of taking advantage of the DIY boom during the pandemic, B&Q owner Kingfisher has nailed it. As people 
rolled up their sleeves and got stuck into home improvements during lockdowns, sales and profits surged with a 
7.1% rise in like for like sales," said Hargreaves Lansdown's Susannah Streeter.
"With the working from home revolution unlikely to fully unravel and demand for home office space set to continue, 
it should keep sales brisk for DIY projects. We should also find out in this trading update if a surge in garden 
makeovers, ready for post lockdown outdoor social lives, has helped revenue streams. As more people leave 
furlough schemes and return to full time working once more, the DIY craze is likely to wane a little, although a 
buoyant housing market is likely to keep our passion for decoration relatively high," she added.
"The forecast of a brighter economic outlook with growth prospects higher also bodes well for the company, given 
that people may have more money in the spending pot to splash on building projects.," Streeter concluded.
Macro matters
Inflation has been the bee in the market's bonnet in recent weeks and is expected to remain the case for some 
months more.
There are no major central bank meetings in the week ahead, but there will be consumer price inflation numbers for 
the UK and others, plus preliminary May purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) for the major industrial economies on 
Friday.
UK CPI was 0.7% in March and 1.0% according to the CPIH index, which includes housing costs.
For the UK there's also house prices from Rightmove on Monday, jobs numbers on Wednesday and retail sales 
data on Friday.
With the PMIs expected to show small declines on the manufacturing side but continued increases for services, 
further increases on the latter side would be welcome, especially in Germany, said market analyst Marshall Gittler 
at BDSwiss.
He added: "[PMI] figures suggesting a continued robust expansion could be taken to be further confirmation of the 
"demand-pull" inflation story, which might be seen as negative for the markets."
On UK jobs numbers, the Bank of England has just cut its forecast for peak unemployment in the wake of the 
pandemic to 5.5%, compared to the latest reading of 4.9% for February.
Airlines, tobacco and telecoms among key sectors in coming week, UK inflation data to provide macro flavour
"The bad news is that the furlough scheme is still needed to support a lot of workers and the claimant count, which 
covers those who are not receiving just unemployment benefit but other assistance such as Universal Credit, has 
rocketed to 2.7mln although at least even that number has begun to flatten out," noted analysts at AJ Bell.
While wage growth is outpacing inflation, which might seem like good news if you have a job and have not been 
furloughed, this feeds back into economists' nervousness about increased commodity and factory gate prices.

Ryanair calls on Irish Government to lift travel restrictions to/from UK and Europe as vaccinations rise
Ryanair calls on Irish Government to lift travel restrictions to/from UK and

Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, has called on the Irish Government to lift travel restrictions, including Ireland's 
unique and failed hotel quarantine, for travel to and from the UK and the European Union.
The airline calls for the immediate removal of all travel restrictions from the end of May, for air travel to and from the 
UK and European Union countries based on the following facts: <ol>
There are less than 100 patients in Irish hospitals suffering from the Covid-19 virus.
All of Ireland's high-risk groups (the elderly, health service, nursing homes, etc.) have now been vaccinated, 
eliminating any COVID risk of our hospitals and health service being overwhelmed.
First dose vaccination rates in the EU are now approaching 40% of all adults receiving at least their first dose 
vaccine.
The UK have now first dose vaccinated more than 60% of its adult population, yet UK visitors that fly to Ireland are 
still required to quarantine for 14 days, when visitors from Northern Ireland can drive across the border with no 
restrictions whatsoever, and Irish citizens can travel to the UK without any quarantine. </ol>
Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson said: "Thanks to the success of the UK's vaccine program, there is no justification for 
requiring visitors to Ireland from the UK (our major visitor market) to quarantine. Most of the UK adult population 
have now received their first dose vaccination, and therefore pose no threat or risk to Ireland's hospitals or health 
service. Equally as Ireland and other EU countries vaccine programs exceed 33% (with most of the high-risk groups 
now fully vaccinated) and with most of Europe on track to vaccinate 80% of its adult population with first dose 
vaccines by the end of June, there is no need or requirement for Ireland to maintain travel restrictions on UK and 
Intra-EU air travel from the end of May onwards.
Ireland's travel restrictions are now outdated, inappropriate and unnecessary for air travel to/from the UK, and the 
European Union, where successful vaccination programs have eliminated any risk to our hospitals and health 
services. It's time our Government got the country and our tourism industry back to work, and we call again on 
Minister Eamonn Ryan to action the Aviation Task Force Report he received in July 2020 - 10 months ago - which 
has been gathering dust on his desk for 10 months with no action taken whatsoever.
Ryanair calls on Irish Government to lift travel restrictions to/from UK and Europe as vaccinations rise
Passengers all over Europe have been booking Ryanair flights in huge volumes over recent weeks as travel 
restrictions are lifted. It is inappropriate and unnecessary for Ireland to maintain its unique, and ineffective hotel 
quarantine system for EU visitors, the majority of whom will now be vaccinated, coming from the UK and Europe. 
Let's end the travel restrictions on EU travel from the end of May."

firm's top five trades during the first quarter included a major reduction in the Baidu Inc. (BIDU[4], Financial[5]) 
position and the sale of the Wells Fargo &#38; Co. holding (WFC[6], Financial[7]). The firm's other key trades 
included a reduction in its holding of Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY[8], Financial[9]), a new position in WestRock 
Co. (WRK[10], Financial[11]) and an increase to its stake in Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT[12], Financial[13]). Co-
founded by Ketterer and Harry Hartford, the Los Angeles-based firm seeks long-term capital appreciation through 
quantitative and fundamental methods to seek prospective stocks for its equity portfolio. Causeway Capital then 
selects the stocks with high expected risk-adjusted returns, low price-earnings ratios and high dividend yield relative 
to the market.

portfolio contains 82 stocks, with 12 new positions and a turnover ratio of 12%. The top four sectors in terms of

Boeing 's 737 MAX given all clear over electrical issues
Boeing's 737 MAX given all clear over electrical issues

Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has had 100 737 MAX aeroplanes cleared to fly again after an issue with the troubled 
plane's electrical systems saw them temporarily grounded.
US air regulator the FAA confirmed to Reuters that the agency had approved the service bulletins and associated 
instructions sent to airlines related to fixing the problem.
"After gaining final approvals from the FAA, we have issued service bulletins for the affected fleet," a spokesperson 
told the news service.
"We are also completing the work as we prepare to resume deliveries."
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson had earlier said that the MAX fleet would need a "pretty straightforward fix."
The MAX 737 had only be approved to fly again in November 2020 after a two-year investigation following crashes 
in five months that killed 346 people.
Boeing's continued MAX woes could cause turbulence for Ryanair
Reuters reported just over a week ago that Boeing had been asked to show that numerous 737 MAX subsystems 
would not be affected by electrical earthing issues.
A number of airlines stopped flying the plane when made aware of the issue, which was linked to a backup power 
control unit in the cockpit.
Boeing 's 737 MAX given all clear over electrical issues
The problem, which also halted delivery of new planes, was also identified in two other places on the flight deck
News of the all-clear will be a boost for several airlines that have ordered multiple MAX aircraft to upgrade their 
fleets.
One such carrier is Ryanair, which last December confirmed an order for 75 new MAX-8200 aircraft, increasing its 
total firm order to the plane model to 210 from 135 previously for a price tag of over US$22bn.
Shares in Ryanair dropped 2.7% to (EURO)16.27 on a poor day for the market overall.

results won't make pretty reading, given that Ryanair reported a €305.5m underlying loss in the third quarter, and 
there has been little relief for the hard-hit travel industry[5]. Ryanair was banking on a vaccine led recovery to save 
the summer season but the limited number of green light destinations on the holiday list so far will be highly 
disappointing. Although Ryanair is used to belt-tightening, it is unlikely it will be able to withstand a further squeeze 
on revenues, if bookings don't resume briskly over coming months the company may be forced to return to the 
market to drum up more financial support. Ryanair's nimble low cost operations might give it the flexibility to adapt 
to short notice route and schedule changes but longer term there is a risk that social distancing desires will stick 
with customers preferring a roomier cabin to cheap seats, which could hurt its business model.''Imperial Brands, 
Half Year Results, Tuesday 18 MaySteve Clayton, HL Select Fund Manager 'Investors will be looking for 
reassurance over execution when Imperial Brands reports its half year results on Tuesday. The group has lagged 
peers in its portfolio of potentially reduced risk products and has not shone in traditional tobacco[6] products either 
in recent years. Imperial's views on a proposed menthol ban in the States will also be sought by 
FTSE 350 Look Ahead: Ryanair, Imperial Brands And More
investors.'Vodafone, Full Year Results, Tuesday 18 MayWilliam Ryder, Equity Analyst 'In its third quarter trading 
update Vodafone reiterated its guidance for €14.4bn to €14.6bn in underlying cash profits (EBITDA), which would 
be a slight fall from the €14.9bn recorded in 2020. Free cash flow is expected to be at least €5.0bn before spectrum 
and restructuring costs. Since then the long-awaited Vantage Towers IPO has gone ahead on the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange, and the spin off achieved a market capitalisation of €12.1bn. So far, Vodafone has raised €2.3bn from 
the deal, assuming all potential shares are sold. The group has since retired some debt, so we'll be taking a close 
look at the balance sheet next week to see how everything has shaken out. Otherwise, we'll be looking for further 
commentary on plans for the portfolio and guidance for 2022. In particular, if the summer tourism season is able to 
go ahead some roaming revenue should return, which could help revitalise sales growth.'Experian, Full Year 
Results, Wednesday 19 MaySteve Clayton, HL Select Fund Manager 'Experian reports full year results on 
Wednesday 19 May. Earlier trading statements have told us that Experian has had a pretty successful FY21 and 
investors will now be eager for an update on how the group sees reopening of economies adding to sales growth. 
Strong cash generation should be pushing debt[7] levels lower and investors will want to see a dividend hike and 
perhaps future plans for additional capital returns, if Experian cannot find deals to absorb its resilient cash 
flow.'Future, Half Year Results, Wednesday 19 MaySophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst  'Future expects full year 
underlying operating profit to be 'materially' ahead of previous market expectations. That's thanks to a strong 
performance from the Media division (70% of group revenue), in the first four months of the year. The group's been 
buoyed by a shift to online advertising spending because of the pandemic, and strong eCommerce sales, and it's 
reasonable to think these trends will have continued in next week's half year results. Remember nothing's 
guaranteed. The Magazine business has fared a lot worse though. Both print and digital content revenue, and Print 
advertising, licensing and publisher services saw revenue fall 30% and 27% respectively last year. Covid has put 
more pressure on these areas of the business, so while performance has been in line with expectations, we'd like to 
see things haven't deteriorated. Future's trying to diversify away from content and offer services too. That was 
behind the 594m acquisition of price comparison business, GoCo, which completed in February. A lot can go wrong 
when integrating an unfamiliar business into the fold, so we'll be reading the update on how things are going with 
interest.'easyJet, Half Year Results, Thursday 20 MaySophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst  'We already know that 
passenger numbers will make for tough reading. The group's results will cover the six months to the end of March, 
most of which were marred by strict travel restrictions throughout Europe. Instead, we'll be focused on two 
important points: liquidity and future guidance. The latter should offer some insight into whether easyJet will get the 
summer travel season it so desperately needs. While passenger demand since the last update has almost certainly 
been muted, we're keen to see what booking rates for later this year look like. We also wonder if easyJet will be 
paying to support customers. Expensive Covid[8] tests could be a barrier to travel, and competitor Tui is subsidising 
some of those costs to entice passengers. That brings us to the second, and perhaps most important metric-
liquidity. At the last check, easyJet had access to roughly 2.9bn, the result of loans and bond issues plus a huge 
cost-saving programme. That pool of cash will drain considerably as demand ramps up - it's expensive to operate 
an airline, particularly when passenger numbers are lower than usual. So, we'll be hoping the group can hold on to 
the bulk of its savings until the summer season begins.'Kingfisher, First Quarter Trading Statement, 20 
MaySusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst ''In terms of taking advantage of the DIY boom 
during the pandemic, B&#38;Q owner Kingfisher has nailed it. As people rolled up their sleeves and got stuck into 
home improvements during lockdowns, sales and profits surged with a 7.1% rise in like for like sales. With the 
working from home revolution unlikely to fully unravel and demand for home office space set to continue, it should 
keep sales brisk for DIY projects. We should also find out in this trading update if a surge in garden makeovers, 
ready for post lockdown outdoor social lives, has helped revenue streams. As more people leave furlough schemes 
and return to full time working once more, the DIY craze is likely to wane a little, although a buoyant housing market 
is likely to keep our passion for decoration relatively high. The forecast of a brighter economic outlook with growth 
prospects higher also bodes well for the company, given that people may have more money in the spending pot to 
splash on building projects.''Royal Mail, Full Year Results, 20 MaySusannah Streeter, senior investment and 
markets analyst 'Royal Mail is expected to deliver some bumper results as it continues to capitalise on the e-
commerce boom. Momentum has snowballed as the group increased its capacity for parcel deliveries after a huge 
upswing in demand left the domestic mail system creaking in December. A renaissance in letter writing was an 
added bonus after declines last year giving the humble post box a new lease of life. But after years of under-
investment the group's UK business is still not home[9] and dry and we should find out just how much more capital 
expenditure will be needed to keep up with demand. Agreements with its unions have helped soothe long running 
FTSE 350 Look Ahead: Ryanair, Imperial Brands And More
industrial tensions but it's the expansion of the company's international business which is set to be the shining light. 
Royal Mail is targeting 12% annual revenue growth over the next five years for GLS with only modest capital 
expenditure, a blueprint its domestic business can as yet only dream of emulating.''Close Brothers, Third Quarter 
Trading Statement, Friday 21 MaySteve Clayton, HL Select Fund Manager 'Close Brothers reports a Q3 trading 
update on 21 May. Bad debts have stayed under control so far and Close have reported some encouraging lending 
data up to now. The market will be hoping to see lending accelerating with muted levels of competition at this stage

May 13, 2021( Proactive Investors: http://www.proactiveinvestors.com Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing 
Co(NYSE:BA)has had 100 737 MAX aeroplanes cleared to fly again after an issue with the troubled plane's 
electrical systems saw them temporarily grounded. US air regulator the FAA confirmed to Reuters that the agency 
had approved the service bulletins and associated instructions sent to airlines related to fixing the problem. 
"After gaining final approvals from the FAA, we have issued service bulletins for the affected fleet," a spokesperson 
told the news service. "We are also completing the work as we prepare to resume deliveries." FAA Administrator 
Steve Dickson had earlier said that the MAX fleet would need a "pretty straightforward fix." The MAX 737 had only 
be approved to fly again in November 2020 after a two-year investigation following crashes in five months that killed 
346 people. Boeing's continued MAX woes could cause turbulence for Ryanair Reuters reported just over a week 
ago that Boeing had been asked to show that numerous 737 MAX subsystems would not be affected by electrical 
earthing issues. A number of airlines stopped flying the plane when made aware of the issue, which waslinked to a 
backup power control unit in the cockpit. The problem, which also halted delivery of new planes, was also identified 
in two other places on the flight deck News of the all-clear will be a boost for several airlines that have ordered 
multiple MAX aircraft to upgrade their fleets. One such carrier is Ryanair, which last December confirmed an order 
for 75 new MAX-8200 aircraft, increasing its total firm order to the plane model to 210 from 135 previously for a 
price tag of over US$22bn. Shares in Ryanair dropped 2.7% to €16.27 on a poor day for the market overall.

Croatia Airlines (OU, Zagreb) has hired Boston Consulting Group to develop and implement a strategy for the post-
Covid market environment, the carrier announced in a stock exchange filing on May 10. The US-headquartered 
consultancy has been "selected as an expert advisor to participate" in the drafting of the strategy, the disclosure 
said, describing the group as "a leading international strategic consulting firm with proven results of supporting 
leading European airlines in the process of recovery from the Covid-19 crisis." Together with the consultancy, 
Croatia Airlines "will try to redefine new market opportunities for connecting European destinations with the region 
of Southeast Europe, maximise future revenue potential, increase aircraft productivity, and define the necessary 
space for further rationalisation and improvement of its business processes." Boston Consulting Group claims on its 
website that its "airline consulting teams [...] serve seven of the ten largest network carriers and six of the top 20 
low-cost carriers" in addition to airports and cargo carriers. 
On April 30, Croatia Airlines posted a first-quarter net loss of HRK96.9 million kunas (USD15.68 million), a 12% 
easing of the HRK110.5 million (USD17.88 million) loss it suffered in the same period last year. It followed a 
HRK358.2 million (USD57.94 million) full-year net loss for 2020. In related news, Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has 
lodged a complaint at the European General Court in Luxembourg against a European Commission decision in 
December to approve EUR11.7 million euros (USD14.2 million) in state aid to Croatia Airlines. The assistance was 
provided to the state-owned flag carrier to compensate for coronavirus-related travel restrictions that Croatia and 
other countries introduced between March 19 and June 30 last year. Ryanair announced new bases in Zagreb and 
Zadar in late March, to open in July and September respectively. However, on May 11, it said it would open the 
Zagreb base in July as well, two months earlier than initially planned, citing strong demand.

May 12, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on May 17.Due to the coronavirus-induced 
declining passenger revenues, this European low-cost carrier suffered a loss in each of the last four quarters. 
However, the loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each quarter. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price 
and EPS Surprise https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price-eps-surprise?icid=chart-RYAAY-price-eps-
surprise Ryanair Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3]Moreover, the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter's loss has narrowed to $1.65 from $2.20, 60 days ago.Against 
this backdrop, let's examine the factors that are likely to have impacted the company's performance in the fiscal 
fourth quarter.Akin to the last few quarters, we expect Ryanair's performance in the to-be-reported quarter to have 
been affected by low passenger revenues on a year-over-year basis. 
The resurgence of coronavirus cases in some parts of Europe worsened the already weak travel-demand scenario, 
which is likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported results.Slow vaccine rollout in the European Union is also likely 
to have hurt traffic, which in turn, might have dented passenger revenues. Additionally, as a result of dismal traffic, 
load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) is likely to have declined year over year in the to-be-reported 
quarter.However, Ryanair's efforts to cut costs in the face of dwindling passenger revenues are expected to have 
aided its bottom-line performance in the fiscal fourth-quarter. What Does the Zacks Model Say? Our proven model 
does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ryanair this time around. The combination of a positiveEarnings 
ESP[4]and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of a positive surprise, which is not 
the case here as shown below. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[5]Earnings 
ESP: Ryanair has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate Estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of a loss of $1.65. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with ourEarnings 
ESP Filter[6].Zacks Rank: Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), currently. Highlights of Q3 Earnings 
Ryanair incurred a loss (excluding 8 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.62 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 
2021 (ended Dec 31, 2020), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.95. Meanwhile, in the 
year-ago period, the company reported earnings of 43 cents per share. Results reflect coronavirus-induced 
disruptions in air-travel demand.Quarterly revenues of $406.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$495 million. Moreover, the top line plunged 80.7% year over year due to a massive decline in traffic. Snapshots of 
Sectorial Releases Even though the transportation stocks have persistently grappled with the coronavirus-induced

Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Additionally, revenues of $1,287.5 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus

Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55. Moreover, the bottom line improved 3.1% year over year on lower costs.Triton 
International Limited's TRTN[9] earnings (excluding 1 cent from non-recurring items) of $1.91 per share surpassed 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70. Moreover, the bottom line surged 105.4% year over year owing to strong

Boeing Co's (NYSE:BA) ongoing issues around the safety of its troubled 737 MAX planes could also spell trouble 
for budget carriers such as Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) as the aviation industry looks to restart following the 
coronavirus pandemic.
The aircraft were grounded in April after the group identified several electrical issues with the aircraft's backup 
power unit, less than six months after being cleared to return to the skies following two fatal crashes which forced 
regulators to suspend their operation in March 2019.

Since the most recent stoppage, the company has identified three areas of the aircraft's electricals that may be 
causing the problem, while last week a Reuters report revealed that US air safety officials had asked Boeing to 
provide more analysis and documentation showing that the issues would not affect other areas of the MAX's 
subsystems.
The electrical problems have caused around 25% of Boeing's fleet of MAX aircraft to be suspended from operating, 
although the firm is expected to release more information on potential repairs as soon as this week as well as a 
possible timetable on when the aircraft will once again be cleared to fly.
While the ongoing problems with the MAX remain a reputation and financial disaster for Boeing, the suspension of 
the aircraft could also throw a spanner into the works of numerous airlines that have ordered multiple MAX aircraft 
to upgrade their fleets.
Boeing's continued MAX woes could cause turbulence for Ryanair
One such carrier is Ryanair, which last December confirmed an order for 75 new MAX-8200 aircraft, increasing its 
total firm order to the plane model to 210 from 135 previously for a price tag of over US$22bn.
READ: Ryanair confirms order for 75 new Boeing MAX aircraft
As the travel industry aims for a return to relative normalcy in the summer period as lockdown restrictions ease, 
airlines are preparing for fierce competition over passengers to rake in as much cash as possible to repair their 
balance sheets, which suffered a battering in 2020 as the pandemic grounded flights across the world.
However, the ongoing delay of the MAX returning to active flights may kneecap Ryanair's expansion plans and 
potentially give the edge to rivals such as easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ), which purchases aircraft from Boeing's French 
rival Airbus.
Shares in Ryanair were down 3.2% at (EURO)16.72 in late afternoon trading in London on Tuesday, while Boeing 
shares fell 3% to US$225.94 in mid-morning trading in New York.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will open two bases in Scandinavia from October 2021, basing two aircraft each at Billund 
in Denmark and another two at Stockholm Arlanda in Sweden, representing a combined investment of USD400 
million, the airline announced. Billund Airport's Chief Executive Officer, Jan Hessellund, expected Ryanair's 
USD200 million base investment in Billund to bring more than 100,000 new tourists to West Denmark. 
Ryanair previously had a base at Billund but closed it in 2015 after Danish trade unions went on strike over the 
carrier's Irish-based collective labour agreement. The 60 employees to be hired now will now work under Danish 
employment conditions, Ryanair Chief Executive Officer, Eddie Wilson, told a local press conference. However, 
Thilde Waast, chairperson of the Flight Personnel Union (FPU) in Denmark, said the parties were still a long way 
from an agreement. "We hope that we can find a solution at the negotiating table before the base is started up," she 
said. Meanwhile, Ryan announced its new base at Stockholm Arlanda would mean another 60 new jobs, 89 
departing flights per week, and 21 new routes to 15 countries across Europe from October, representing another 
USD200 million investment. This would include Ryanair's first domestic Swedish services from Stockholm Arlanda 
to Gothenburg Landvetter (14 x weekly) and Malmö (10 x weekly).

European governments have gone retro. After the wave of privatisations in aviation two decades ago, the 
coronavirus crisis has caused a sharp policy reversal as countries across the continent have stumped up billions of 
euros to save national flag carriers.
The (EURO)20bn invested in groups seen as too big to fail has left Paris with a near-30 per cent stake in Air 
France-KLM, Berlin with 20 per cent in Lufthansa and Rome with 100 per cent of Alitalia.
But a backlash against state support is growing as rival carriers fear warped competition. While governments 
defend investment as necessary to save airlines facing unprecedented shortterm risks, critics say the help could 
allow the groups to avoid the tough decisions needed for long-term growth.
The fiercest critic has been Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who has filed 16 cases to test the state aid rules in 
European courts, arguing that support made available to flag carriers is discriminatory. The Irish chief executive 
claims companies such as Air France will never be able to pay governments back but will be able to "subsidise and 
suppress competition for the next decade".
"We, easyJet, [BA owner] IAG and the others have to compete with these stateaid, crack cocaine junkies," he said.

(EURO)20bn U-turn on aviation industry privatis....
Ryanair has lost all five cases decided so far but O'Leary told the Financial Times he thought there was a "very 
strong likelihood" his low-cost airline would overturn the verdicts on appeal.
The pandemic has also highlighted differences between the continental Europeans, where state-aid rules were 
relaxed to help companies survive the crisis, and the US and UK.
The British and Americans have stopped short of taking equity stakes despite offering billions in support, leading 
some to argue their airlines will emerge stronger as they have been forced to make aggressive cuts.
"When we're out of this, it will be immensely liberating for the companies that don't have governments in their 
register ... to be nimble and agile," Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, whose airline was denied aid by 
the UK last year and raised cash privately.
O'Leary agrees, insisting government intervention creates an opportunity for airlines like his "to become ever more 
efficient and competitive, just to survive against the billions of state aid".
But the support has underlined the importance of airlines as significant employers and strategic assets. Not only 
have the companies welcomed the support to cope with the collapse in passenger numbers, but falling share prices 
have made them cheaper takeover targets for foreign competitors.
"In Europe, this crisis has revived old concerns," Martin Vial, who runs France's state equity investments, told the 
FT, alluding to the potential threat of US or Chinese groups building up stakes in companies on the continent.
"[Governments] have to make sure that some of the biggest businesses in these countries, private or public, do not 
fall victim to predators because obviously the crisis is going to open up opportunities," he added.
Analysts agree there is a strong argument for viewing flag carriers as strategic. "Let's say some midsized company 
from France wants to build a new production plant in Bratislava. Will it build that plant in Bratislava if it couldn't rely 
on there being consistent air services to that place?" said Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein.
Italy has gone the whole hog, nationalising its flag carrier Alitalia with plans to relaunch it through a new company 
called ITA. But before Rome can consider any exit plans, it must first wrestle with Brussels over state aid 
conditions.
The European Commission is demanding a big reduction in the proposed company's allocation of airport slots, the 
sale of handling and ground services, and job cuts.
In France and Germany, full ownership is not on the agenda. Paris is promising to scale back its equity investment 
in Air France-KLM over time, while Berlin has said it hopes to sell its stake when the airline "is fit again".
But restoring the health of the airlines may take longer than expected.
Bernstein's Roeska warns the legacy carriers will wear the scars of the crisis for years as they struggle to 
deleverage and restructure. "The price will be lower growth," he said.
The carriers also face constraints in exchange for state support, including meeting new environmental standards.
Andrew Charlton, an analyst who led the privatisation of Australian carrier
Qantas in the 1990s, argues it is difficult for governments to maintain a boundary between fair competition and their 
own interests. "What is the analysis that calls for governments and countries to have their flag flown around the 
world?" he said. "The concern is you will be unconnected to the world but, really - no one is going to fly to Paris or 
Berlin?"

Ryanair has lost all five cases decided so far but O'Leary told the Financial Times he thought there was a "very 
strong likelihood" his low-cost airline would overturn the verdicts on appeal.
The pandemic has also highlighted differences between the continental Europeans, where state-aid rules were 
relaxed to help companies survive the crisis, and the US and UK.
The British and Americans have stopped short of taking equity stakes despite offering billions in support, leading 
some to argue their airlines will emerge stronger as they have been forced to make aggressive cuts.
"When we're out of this, it will be immensely liberating for the companies that don't have governments in their 
register ... to be nimble and agile," Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, whose airline was denied aid by 
the UK last year and raised cash privately.
O'Leary agrees, insisting government intervention creates an opportunity for airlines like his "to become ever more 
efficient and competitive, just to survive against the billions of state aid".
But the support has underlined the importance of airlines as significant employers and strategic assets. Not only 
have the companies welcomed the support to cope with the collapse in passenger numbers, but falling share prices 
have made them cheaper takeover targets for foreign competitors.
"In Europe, this crisis has revived old concerns," Martin Vial, who runs France's state equity investments, told the 
FT, alluding to the potential threat of US or Chinese groups building up stakes in companies on the continent.
"[Governments] have to make sure that some of the biggest businesses in these countries, private or public, do not 
fall victim to predators because obviously the crisis is going to open up opportunities," he added.
Analysts agree there is a strong argument for viewing flag carriers as strategic. "Let's say some midsized company 
from France wants to build a new production plant in Bratislava. Will it build that plant in Bratislava if it couldn't rely 
on there being consistent air services to that place?" said Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein.
Italy has gone the whole hog, nationalising its flag carrier Alitalia with plans to relaunch it through a new company 
called ITA. But before Rome can consider any exit plans, it must first wrestle with Brussels over state aid 
conditions.
The European Commission is demanding a big reduction in the proposed company's allocation of airport slots, the 
sale of handling and ground services, and job cuts.
In France and Germany, full ownership is not on the agenda. Paris is promising to scale back its equity investment 
in Air France-KLM over time, while Berlin has said it hopes to sell its stake when the airline "is fit again".
But restoring the health of the airlines may take longer than expected.
Bernstein's Roeska warns the legacy carriers will wear the scars of the crisis for years as they struggle to 
deleverage and restructure. "The price will be lower growth," he said.
The carriers also face constraints in exchange for state support, including meeting new environmental standards.
Andrew Charlton, an analyst who led the privatisation of Australian carrier
Qantas in the 1990s, argues it is difficult for governments to maintain a boundary between fair competition and their 
own interests. "What is the analysis that calls for governments and countries to have their flag flown around the 
world?" he said. "The concern is you will be unconnected to the world but, really - no one is going to fly to Paris or 
Berlin?"

European governments have gone retro. After the wave of privatisations in aviation two decades ago, the 
coronavirus crisis has caused a sharp policy reversal as countries across the continent have stumped up billions of 
euros to save national flag carriers.
The (EURO)20bn invested in groups seen as too big to fail has left Paris with a near-30 per cent stake in Air 
France-KLM, Berlin with 20 per cent in Lufthansa and Rome with 100 per cent of Alitalia.
But a backlash against state support is growing as rival carriers fear warped competition. While governments 
defend investment as necessary to save airlines facing unprecedented shortterm risks, critics say the help could 
allow the groups to avoid the tough decisions needed for long-term growth.
The fiercest critic has been Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who has filed 16 cases to test the state aid rules in 
European courts, arguing that support made available to flag carriers is discriminatory. The Irish chief executive 
claims companies such as Air France will never be able to pay governments back but will be able to "subsidise and 
suppress competition for the next decade".
"We, easyJet, [BA owner] IAG and the others have to compete with these stateaid, crack cocaine junkies," he said.

May 10, 2021( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  <nl/ > A man, Mohammed Shiraz 
Riaz, traveling by RyanAir asked for more alcohol after consuming four drinks. When he didn't get it, he started 
hurling abuse at cabin crew member Jelena Zuravska. <nl/ >The 40-year-old tried to humiliate the woman by 
shouting "who f***ed your mother" and called her "fat stewardess white b****," reported Liverpool Echo[1]. <nl/ >The 
woman got so scared that she slipped a note under the cockpit door asking the captain to call the police to meet 
them at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. 
<nl/ >He got so aggressive that other passengers on the two-hour flight from Marrakesh to Liverpool had to be 
moved away from him. While some offered help to the woman, one threatened to punch Riaz. <nl/ > <nl/ >Riaz was 
supposed to face a trial at Wirral Magistrates' Court last week, but he didn't turn up as he had to self isolate. 
Despite his absence, the trial went ahead. <nl/ >Zuravska confirmed that she was the cabin crew supervisor on the 
flight on July 15, 2019. Recalling the incident, she said that Riaz sat in the front row of the plane and started the 
conversation on a "friendly" note asking for four Jack Daniels with Coke and a sandwich, which Zuravska served 
him. <nl/ >When he asked for another drink she said that she was busy and as Riaz went to the toilet he was 
"talking to himself" and was heard to mutter "f---ing fat b****stewardess." Zuravska said, "I remained professional 
and suggested that he sat down and have something to eat. At this point I made the decision not to serve him any 
more alcohol, I didn't want to make the situation any worse." <nl/ > Riaz sat down for a while but was "persistently" 
asking for more alcohol. She said, "I said no and he became more aggressive and loud. He started verbally 
attacking me personally, saying 'who f***ed your mother fat stewardess white b****." <nl/ >"I tried to remain as calm 
as I could and be professional for the safety of the other passengers. I just felt he was trying to provoke me." She 
said, "He seemed to have a real hatred towards women. As he became more aggressive towards me and more 
vocal, other passengers stepped in to triedand calm the situation. "One even wanted to punch him on my behalf." 
<nl/ >PC Michael Ireland said that when the doors of the plane opened he could see Zurvaska "clearly upset" with 
Riaz "standing behind her holding a black holdall." He said, "He came down the steps, presented his wrists and 
said 'you may as well handcuff me now.'" <nl/ >PC Ireland said that Riaz claimed, "I've done f***all wrong that fat 
b****has called you to make me look stupid." <nl/ >The court heard that as there was no cage in the back of the car 
so, PC Ireland sat next to Riaz who "bounced backwards and forward." When Ireland tried to restrain him, Riaz bit 
his arm. <nl/ >Riaz, of Kaye Street, Heckmondwike in West Yorkshire, was charged with being drunk in a plane and 
assaulting an emergency worker and was found guilty in his absence. A warrant for Riaz's arrest was issued. <nl/ 
>In another mid-flight incident, a woman allegedly assaulted a flight attendant during an American Airlines flight 
from Miami to New York City. In a statement, American Airlines said that that "a customer who refused to comply 
Man Guzzles Whiskey, Launches Vile Rant And Abuses Flight Attendant
with the federal face mask requirement assaulted a crew member while in flight." <nl/ >"Violence of any kind is not 
tolerated by American," said the statement, CNN[2] reported last week. <nl/ > An American Airlines plane is seen at 
sunrise on the tarmac of the Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Arlington, Virginia, on April 22, 2021.

England gives green light to foreign holidays; Travel Tourists still face strict 
Covid curbs and limited number of destinations

Travellers from England will be allowed to resume foreign holidays later this month, but will be able to visit only a 
handful of destinations without having to quarantine on their return.
Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, yesterday confirmed plans for a "traffic light" system to reopen international 
travel from May 17, and said Portugal,
Gibraltar and Israel would be among 12 countries and territories on the least restricted "green list".
The others are Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand, Australia, Ascension Island and St 
Helena, along with the barely inhabited South Georgia, Tristan da Cunha and South Sandwich Islands.
Travellers returning from countries on the green list will not need to quarantine but will have to take a Covid-19 test 
before they return to England, and a more costly PCR test on their second day after arrival.
But not all green list countries will be open to British tourists. Australia, New
Zealand, Singapore and Brunei, for example, restrict international arrivals.
England gives green light to foreign holidays; Travel Tourists still face strict Covid curbs and limited number of 
destinations
Shapps said the government was taking its "first, albeit tentative" steps towards reopening borders and that the 
approach was "necessarily cautious".
The plans apply only to England, meaning that Scots and Welsh eager for holidays could rush over the border to 
English airports. The Department for Transport said it hoped the devolved nations would work with Westminster on 
the travel guidance.
In a blow to the travel industry, tourist hotspots including Spain, France and Greece were classified amber, meaning 
passengers will have to self-isolate for 10 days on their return and take PCR tests on day two and day eight after 
return, with the option of an additional "test to release" after five days.
The list will be updated every three weeks and travellers will be given advance warning if there are concerns over 
countries on the green list. "Thanks to a downward trend in Covid cases and improving vaccination rates, we fully 
expect France and Spain to be reclassified as green countries in the weeks ahead," said Christophe Mathieu, 
Brittany Ferries' chief executive.
Those returning from red list countries, which Shapps said would include Turkey, Nepal and the Maldives from 4am 
on Wednesday, will have to quarantine in hotels at their own expense and take PCR tests on days two and eight.
The travel industry welcomed any opportunity to resuscitate international travel, but was disappointed ministers did 
not open up more countries to frictionless travel.
"We cannot stress more greatly that the UK urgently needs travel between it and other low-risk countries, like the 
US, to restart the economy, support devastated industries and reunite loved ones," Sean Doyle, chief executive of 
British Airways, said.
Ryanair said that in response to the announcement it would add an additional 175,000 seats between English and 
Portuguese airports from May 17 to the end of October.
Shapps warned holidaymakers to expect considerable delays at passport control, as electronic passport gates have 
been shut and Border Force officers are manually checking each passenger entering the country. It is currently 
taking five to 10 minutes to check each passenger, up from a normal 25 seconds.
Extra officers are being deployed, but queues have reached more than six hours at Heathrow airport with only a 
fraction of the normal number of people flying.

US adds 266,000 jobs instead of 1mln
5.10pm: FTSE closes ahead
FTSE 100 closed Friday ahead as Wall Street headed north too as the big miss on the US monthly jobs number 
convinced traders the US central bank wouldn't change direction any time soon.
The UK index of top shares closed up over 53 points at 7,129. The midcap FTSE 250 was also higher, adding 
almost 284 points at 22,775.
Across the pond, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added over 164 points at 34,712, while the S&P 500  added 
around 32 at 4,234. The Nasdaq added 172 points at 13,804.
"When repeated Fed messages about making no changes to monetary policy fail to calm market fears about 
tapering, a good miss on non-farms payroll day will do the trick," said Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at 
IG.
"Today's 'huge miss' on the headline NFP figure, and the downgrade to last month's blowout figure, contributed to a 
general relaxation of nerves regarding any changes to Fed policy. Risk assets took off, the dollar fell, and gold built 
on its strong rally in yesterday's session."
Top gainer on Footsie was online grocery firm Ocado (LON:OCDO), which rose 3.95% to 1,975p.
FTSE 100 closes ahead as US jobs miss boosts shares
3.40pm: Flight prices rocket ahead of 'green list' announcement later today
FTSE 100 recovered some of the earlier gains before close, jumping 46 points to 7,122.
Flight prices have rocketed in anticipation of Grant Shapps's announcement expected at 5pm today on what 
countries will make it in the 'green list'.
On Thursday night, a Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) flight from London to Lisbon cost £152 compared to £15 the day 
before, the Evening Standard reported.
Booking.com's chief executive Glenn Fogel told the BBC prices were going up due to pent-up demand and lack of 
scheduled trips.
It is understood it might be between ten or 12 countries, including Malta, Gibraltar, Portugal and Israel. Spain, 
Greece, France, the Seychelles and Iceland have also been rumoured as potential candidates.
The government's travel plans involve a traffic light system of red, amber and green classifications for countries 
depending on the perceived COVID-19 risk.
The 'green' category means that travellers are not required to quarantine although tests will remain mandatory.

2.45pm: US stocks start higher
US benchmarks started in the green on Friday as investors mulled over the big miss in the monthly jobs report.
FTSE 100 closes ahead as US jobs miss boosts shares
The US economy added just 266,000 jobs in April this year, while consensus estimates had been for one million 
new positions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added around 44 points at 34,593 in early deals; the Nasdaq gained over 104 
points at 13,736 and the S&P 500 jumped around 14 at 4,216.
"The debate on whether entitlement spending is hurting hiring will grow, but in the end this big miss should give 
Biden more ammunition to push through his next stimulus/infrastructure package," noted analyst Edward Moya at 
Oanda.
"Hiring has been rapidly increasing across the country after an impressive vaccine rollout that has the country 
poised to reach 50% of the US population to be vaccinated by this month.  This is only one report, but this is 
changing many traders thinking on how this recovery is unfolding."
He added that the number was disappointing, but that "the US recovery still remains intact and Wall Street should 
still expect growth exceptionalism over the coming months, which in the end should lead to much higher Treasury 
yields".
Banking and financial gaint ING said that the April report was "likely more a reflection of structural rigidities and 
supply constraints rather than any meaningful weakening in demand for labour".
1.55pm: US jobs data comes well below forecast due to labour shortages
FTSE 100 retracted in the early afternoon, rising 22 points to 7,099.
US stock futures went into reverse an hour ahead of the Wall Street open after April's US jobs growth proved much 
weaker than expected.
Employers added just 266,000 jobs last month, while unemployment rose to 6.1%. Reuters had predicted that April 
US non-farm payrolls (NFP) would increase by 978,000 jobs after rising by 916,000 in March.
 U.S. payrolls grew by +266k, which would be fabulous in normal times, but is utterly disappointing at a moment in 
which forecasters expected +1 million jobs, and we're still missing millions of pre-pandemic jobs. This is a big miss 
that changes how we think about the recovery. - Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) May 7, 2021
It was likely due to labour shortages, Reuters reported, as businesses were overwhelmed by booming demand.
The unemployment rate rose slightly to 6.1%, the first increase in a year.
 I wouldn't read too much into the miss (266k new jobs vs. 998k estimated) in today's payroll report. Jobless claims 
continue to trend lower and with the reopening set to accelerate in the coming months we will likely see millions of 
jobs added back. pic.twitter.com/ADk3k3y333 - Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) May 7, 2021
Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade commented: "Looking at the US NFP data, it seems like that 1 
was missing at the beginning of today's number. Market was expecting nearly a million, and we got 266K. One thing 
is clear that the loose monetary policy isn't going anywhere soon."
"Traders have shown animals spirts when it comes to gold prices as the gold price is ripping all the resistance 
levels in its way. The dollar index was weaker going into the release of this data and now we know for certain that 
there is plenty of more weakness ahead. This has made gold traders go wild and the risk-off rally is in big time," 
Aslam added.
1pm: UK to avoid AstraZeneca vaccine in under 40s amid blood clots concerns
The UK has decided to provide under 40s with an alternative to the vaccine developed by Oxford University and 
AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN).
FTSE 100 closes ahead as US jobs miss boosts shares
The move comes after 242 cases of blood clots were reported among the 28.5mln doses administered in the UK.
One in 60,000 people in their 30s are at risk, compared to one in 100,000 people in their 40s, while risks of 
developing severe COVID-19 increase with age.
"Our position remains that the benefits of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca against COVID-19, with its 
associated risk of hospitalisation and death, continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people," said Dr 
June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)
"The balance of benefits and risks is very favourable for older people but is more finely balanced for younger people 
and we advise that this evolving evidence should be taken into account when considering the use of the vaccine."
The MHRA advise people to seek medical advice if they experience a new onset of severe or persistent headache, 
blurred vision, confusion or seizures, develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal 
pain and unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the injection site.
Shares in the pharma giant were unmoved at 7,690.14p, while FTSE 100 trimmed its gains and was up 43 points to 
7,119.
12.05pm: Wall Street set for green open after jobs data release
FTSE 100 continued its climb at midday, adding 51 points to 7,128.
In the US, futures are pointing at a green open for the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq after a volatile week.
"In recent days, investors have been piling into risk-sensitive assets, including commodities and value stocks and 
anything that relies on economic growth," said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets.
"Indeed, the Dow surged to a fresh record high as more signs of an improving economy emerged, with applications 
for unemployment benefits falling last week to a fresh pandemic low. But on Thursday, the tech sector also found 
renewed strength as yields dipped on the back of dovish remarks from several Fed officials who have moved to 
alleviate speculation over monetary tightening amid rising inflationary pressures."
It's the first Friday of the month so that means it is US non-farm payrolls day with economists expecting the

"Heading into the non-farm payrolls, the key question for stock market participants would be this: will the Nasdaq be

11.15am: Single-use plastic bags to cost 10p at all retailers in England
The Footsie was looking up in the late morning, jumping 40 points to 7,116.
Meanwhile, sterling rose 0.2% to US$1.3922 as it rebound following Thursday's Bank of England announcements.
The UK government has increased the price of single-use plastic bags for all businesses in England from 5p to 10p, 
with the aim of reducing plastic pollution.
The new measure will be enforced from 21 May, with the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs saying 
the charge helped drive down 95% plastic bag sales since it was first introduced in 2015.
A new survey by charity WRAP shows that 69% of respondents were either 'strongly' or 'slightly' in favour of the 
charge when it was first introduced, and that has increased now to 73%.
Two-thirds said they used a 'bag-for-life' - either fabric or more durable plastic - to take their shopping home for a 
large food shop in-store, with only 14% using a single-use carrier bag.
FTSE 100 closes ahead as US jobs miss boosts shares
10.15am: Conservatives win Hartlepool from Labour in by-election
FTSE 100 was on the rise in mid-morning, jumping 33 points to 7,109.
Hartlepool has elected a Conservative MP for the first time ever in this week's by-election.
Jill Mortimer beat Labour's Paul Williams by 6,940 votes.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Parliamentary election will reveal whether the Scottish National Party (SNP) manages to 
gain an outright majority.
"The party fell slightly short in the 2016 election, and recent polls suggest it's a close call again," economists at ING 
Economics said.
"But even if the SNP fails to gain a majority this time, there is talk of some form of coalition or agreement with the 
Greens, which are also pro-independence. In other words, the result is likely to lead to renewed calls for a second 
referendum."
8.55am: FTSE 100 gains altitude, but BA owner IAG left grounded after another set of dire results
The FTSE 100 made a positive start to what is expected to be a reasonably busy end to the week.
The Tory win in Hartlepool, a rock-solid Labour seat for more than half a century, may ease some pressure on Boris 
Johnson in the wake of 'wallpapergate' as should the results from the local elections.
Counting after the Scottish polls is underway. The predicted resounding win for the nationalists will bring more 
pressure for a second independence referendum.
So, for the PM one political headache may be replaced by another.
Imminent are the latest construction PMIs, which are likely to copper-bottom the Bank of England's bullish recovery 
scenario, while over in the US we have the monthly official jobs numbers.
On the market, the aerospace groups Rolls Royce (LON:RR.) and Melrose (LON:MRO), owner of GKN, were flying 
high(ish) with gains of 2% and 1.7% respectively.
Presumably, the early mark-up reflected a potential return to international travel, albeit limited to certain countries, 
which would then have a knock-on impact for the companies that maintain the world's fleets of jet airliners.
For British Airways and Iberia owner IAG (LON:IAG) the picture was still a dour one - which might explain why the 
shares stood pat on a day of optimism for the wider sector.
The quarterlies revealed the company posted a near £1bn loss, while traffic has returned to just a quarter of its pre-
Covid level.
"IAG may be poised for a return to the skies, but for the moment its prospects are grounded on factors beyond its 
control," said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.

0.21% of the currently issued ordinary share capital.
6:50 am: Firm start predicted
London's leading equities are set for a firm start ahead of the release this afternoon of US jobs figures for April.
Spread betting quotes indicate the FTSE 100 will open 40 points higher at 7,107, more or less doubling yesterday's 
rise in an instant.
US markets put their best foot forward yesterday with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 318 points to 
34,549 and the S&P 500 advancing 34 points to 4,202.
"With global recovery price action and the Non-Farms dominating investors' minds, Asia's data has been somewhat 
subsumed today. Nevertheless, it contained nothing to dull the recovery narrative. South Korea's Trade Balance 
modestly outperformed, coming in at $7.82 billion. Japan's Jibun Bank Services PMI improved to 49.5, with the 
street ignoring signals of extended and tightening Covid-19 restrictions in Japan," reported OANDA's Jeffrey Halley.
"Front and centre was China's Caixin Services PMI, which rose strongly in April to 56.30. It indicated that the 
directional of travel for China's domestic recovery continues in the right direction. It has also dampened any 
negative feedback on the tense geopolitical front between China, and seemingly, the rest of the entire planet this 
week.
"China has just released its Balance of Trade which has printed at $42.86 billion in dollar terms, well above the 
$28.1 billion expected. The YoY [year-on-year] export and import numbers have leapt massively but are slightly 
disingenuous, reflecting a shallow Covid-19 base in April last year. Nevertheless, the data is excellent and should 
be supportive, along with the Caixin PMI for regional equities today," he added.
The Hang Seng has responded to the Chinese data by climbing 107 points to 28,745. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's 
Nikkei 225 is 45 points to the good at 39,376.
FTSE 100 closes ahead as US jobs miss boosts shares
Forecasts for the increase in US non-farm payrolls are around the 1mln mark, though this forecast figure has been 
edging higher.
"Average estimates are for a number in the region of 1mln especially since weekly jobless claims are also trending 
lower dropping below 500k a week yesterday, and a post lockdown low, while the unemployment rate is expected to 
fall further, from 6% to 5.8%,2 said CMC's Michael Hewson.
"This is very welcome especially since the participation rate has remained steady and actually edged up to 61.5% in 
March, and which is expected to move higher today, suggesting early signs that more disincentivised workers are 
returning to the workforce.
"Some Fed officials have indicated that they want to see clear evidence of the participation rate moving much 
higher before considering any change in monetary policy. It was notable from Fed chair Jay Powell's most recent 
press conference that the FOMC wanted to see consistently good jobs numbers over a matter of months, with 
constant references to 'substantial further progress'," Hewson added.
On the domestic front, it's "inter Friday" with travel-related stocks International Consolidated Airlines Group SA 
(LON:IAG), the owner of British Airways, and InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (LON:IHG) scheduled to report.
Both companies are likely to be in "putting a brave face on things" mode, with both waiting on the vaccinated 
cavalry to arrive and save their skins, although IAG more so than IHG.
UBS is forecasting first-quarter revenue of (EURO)1.1bn for IAG, in line with the consensus and way down on the 
(EURO)4.6bn raked in during the same period of 2020.
The Swiss bank is predicting a loss before interest and tax of (EURO)1.2bn, also in line with consensus, compared 
to a loss the year before of (EURO)535mln.
"The focus will be restructuring, balance sheet strength, cash burn, outlook for summer capacity and for rest of the 
year," UBS said.
Due to the franchise structure of Holiday Inn owner IHG, the firm has been one of the few in the industry to continue 
delivering underlying profit during the pandemic, although not much is expected to have changed since the last 
update given most nations still have travel restrictions in place.
One potential bright spot may be internal demand from domestic travel, especially in the US, as well as growth from 
the Chinese market a year on from the country's first pandemic shutdown.

Ryanair will start flying to Stockholm Arlanda Airport during the winter season 2021 when it will open a base. 
Initially, this will involve two aircraft and some twenty European destinations, which will mean nearly 90 new weekly 
departures from Arlanda. A number of destinations are new for the airport and complement Arlanda's other 
destinations on offer. In conjunction with the set-up of operations, Ryanair will launch domestic service in Sweden 
for the first time, to Gothenburg and Malmö from Arlanda.

destinations on offer. In conjunction with the set-up of operations, Ryanair will launch domestic service in Sweden 
for the first time, to Gothenburg and Malmö from Arlanda.
"It is with great joy that we welcome Ryanair to Arlanda and Ryanair's continued expansion in the Swedish market. 
Their large number of destinations is an important addition and complement to the existing range of destinations 
available at our airports. At the same time, access is improved both within Sweden and outside the country, and this 
is especially true for the important visiting relatives and friends travel segment. Access will be important in the 
restart after the pandemic, and more direct routes are important for regional growth and for the tourism industry all 
across Sweden. We have had a good partnership for many years with Ryanair that we now look forward to 
developing in the years to come," says Charlotte Ljunggren, Director of Market & Commercial Development at 
Swedavia.
Ryanair also continues to expand at Göteborg Landvetter. In addition to the new domestic route to Stockholm, 
Ryanair is launching service in the autumn to Zagreb, Croatia; Riga, Latvia; and Billund, Denmark.
After a period of absence due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Ryanair is also returning to Malmö Airport. In early June, 
Ryanair will resume service to the Polish city of Krakow, followed by service to Arlanda in the autumn.
Ryanair was founded in 1985 by the Ireland-based Ryan family. The Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc is 
the largest airline group in Europe today and includes the subsidiaries Buzz, Lauda and Malta Air along with 
Ryanair. The company has some 80 bases with connections to about 250 destinations in 40 countries, with a fleet 
Ryanair continues to expand in Sweden with a new base and some 20 new routes at Stockholm Arlanda Airport
of 460 aircraft and another 210 Boeing 737 aircraft on order. Ryanair has high sustainability goals and plans to fuel 
12.5 per cent of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. For more information about the 
airline: www.ryanair.com
Swedavia has carried out ambitious sustainability work for many years. All ten of its airports achieved the goal of 
zero fossil carbon dioxide emissions from their own operations by year-end 2020. Swedavia also works actively to 
promote the switch to biofuel and has the goal that five per cent of all fuel used for refuelling at Swedish airports 
shall be fossil-free by 2025.

May 07, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  <nl/ > This week's Update features a 
number of stories on the growing short-term rental industry, including Sonder's recently announced plan to go 
public. Enjoy. <nl/ > <nl/ >Ryanair Takes on Online Travel Agents (OTA).[1] ("Ryanair launches new price checker 
and verified seal to further protect customers from OTAs," April 28, 2021 via Travel Daily News) Ryanair announced 
this past month the launch of two initiatives: the Price Checker and Verified Seal. 
Both initiatives, which are available only on the Ryanair website and app, are designed to stop OTAs (none of which 
have commercial relationships with Ryanair) from overcharging users, providing incorrect passenger details and 
preventing the airline from dealing directly with passengers. The Price Checker allows passengers who have 
booked tickets through an OTA to check the amount actually paid by the OTA to Ryanair, versus any margin, 
markup or other fee added by the OTA. The Verified Seal guarantees passengers that they are booking directly with 
Ryanair, and not through an unauthorized distributor or reseller. Those booking directly through Ryanair are 
assured to receive the lowest fares, the lowest fees and charges for ancillary items and refunds paid directly by 
Ryanair to the passenger (and not an intermediary). <nl/ > <nl/ >Are Direct Bookings Possible with Short-Term 
Rentals?[2] (The Grip of Airbnb and Short-Term Rental Giants Leaves Direct Bookings Elusive," April 28, 2021 via 
Skift Travel News) Short-term rental owners and managers seeking to attract direct bookers are finding the process 
exceedingly difficult. Spurred by Airbnb's now infamous decision to unilaterally refund travelers' deposits for COVID-
related cancellations, many owners and managers are trying to go at it alone. Unfortunately, with demand for short-
term rentals continuing to grow, the big platforms' (Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com) have restarted their efforts to 
regain market share, making the elusive direct booker even harder to find. Sound familiar to anyone? <nl/ > <nl/ 
>Sonder Doubles Valuation in Less Than Two Years[3]. ("Sonder plans to go public through SPAC on a $2.2B 
valuation," April 30, 2021 via Phocus Wire) It wasn't even two years ago (July 2019) that we featured a story 
detailing the then apartment-style rental company's meteoric rise and incredible $1 billion valuation. Following its 
recently announced merger with SPAC Gores Metropoulos II, Sonder estimates the combined public company will 
have a valuation double that at $2.2 billion. Proceeds from the transaction, which are expected to exceed $600 
million, will be used to expand the company and further invest in its technology-driven operations platform. Sonder

Green light scheme criticised by airlines again as TUI chops Covid test to £20
Green light scheme criticised by airlines again as TUI chops Covid test to 
£20

Tui AG (LON:TUI) is to offer Covid-19 tests for £20 to passengers travelling to countries on the UK's Green List, the 
travel firm announced today.
The German giant has partnered with approved kit provider Chromonics to provide the cut-price test and said 
passengers can apply for a test package from 10 May once they have booked their flight.
The UK government will announce the categories in which countries are rated tomorrow, but indications so far are 
that only a handful will be green-lighted and not the most popular holiday destinations.
Britain is using a traffic light system of red, amber and green to categorise countries according to the perceived 
Covid-19 risk of coronavirus, health infrastructure, vaccination programmes and other measures.
Israel, Iceland, Portugal, Malta and Gibraltar have been widely reported as being on the green list, which means 
travellers have to be tested but do not have to quarantine on arrival or when they return.
People travelling to amber-rated countries, which are likely to include France Italy and Spain, will have to self-
isolate for ten days when they come back unless they return a negative test after five days.
Travellers to countries on the red list have to spend ten days in a quarantine hotel when they return and take tests 
pre-departure and on day 2 and eight following their arrival back in the UK.
Green light scheme criticised by airlines again as TUI chops Covid test to £20
Airlines criticised the plan again overnight saying it was illogical to make people who have been fully vaccinated 
take a test and said that the plan means flights are resuming in name only.
The group, which included the chief executives of Jet2, British Airways and Easyjet accused the government of 
being too cautious.
"Instead of taking advantage of the success of the vaccine programme, the Government risks closing the UK off 
from the rest of the world," they said in the open letter.
Airlines have also been critical of the cost of testing, which for some PCR tests starts at £120.
Tui added that passengers flying to amber-rated countries would pay £50 per person for the required pre-departure 
lateral flow test (instant) and two PCR tests (sent to laboratory) upon return.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, has cut the price of test kits to £60 for UK-based customers, while British Airways 
announced a £33 cost after agreeing on a deal with test kit group Qured.
Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK & Ireland, said: "We have always believed that cost-effective testing 
solutions, as well as maximum flexibility, will make travel a possibility this summer and beyond.
"Also, should testing requirements change between purchase and travel, for example if an amber package is 
purchased and the destination moves on to the green list, we'll simply refund the difference."

with three weekly departures with Ryanair from November 2021 and prices from DKK 149.
From November 2021, Ryanair will fly directly to Stockholm Arlanda from Aalborg Airport. Stockholm is a very 
popular destination that has long been desired at Aalborg Airport - to the benefit of both business- and leisure 
travelers.
- The route to Stockholm is important to North Jutland in many ways - both for the business community, which with 
a direct connection gets easy access to Arlanda, and for the leisure travelers, where Stockholm is just a fantastic 
and beautiful city with many different sights, says CEO of Aalborg Airport Niels Hemmingsen and continues - At the 
same time, the route and the many North Jutland sights will attract a large number of Swedish tourists here, to the 
great benefit of the Danish tourism sector.

Acciona wins admirers with plan to make sustainability add up
Acciona wins admirers with plan to make sustainability add up

W hen Michael O'Leary is ready to pay a premium for sustainable jet fuel to help save the planet, you know the 
business world has changed.
The chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair last week pledged to power 12.5 per cent of its flights with green fuel 
- currently two to four times more costly than standard fuel - by 2030 in a bid to cut carbon emissions. It was a 
sharp U-turn on his previous position that Ryanair would shift from traditional fuel only if prices were equivalent.
Not everyone captures attention like the outspoken O'Leary. But others are quietly doing even more in a sign of 
how mainstream climate issues have become for companies. Just days before the Ryanair boss's change of heart, 
the Spanish infrastructure and renewables company, Acciona, unveiled a new fiveyear sustainability plan.
Acciona has long focused on the issue. In 2009, the board set up a "sustainability committee" and it has been net-
zero carbon emitting since 2016.
But buried in the details of its new plan, Acciona revealed it had moved sustainability from the marketing 
department, handing responsibility for environmental, social and governance targets to the finance director. It may 
not be an outright first. But the decision is so rare that those who advocate integration of financial and sustainability 
reporting struggle to think of another company that has done the same.
Jessica Fries, executive chair of Accounting for Sustainability, a charity founded 17 years ago to make the issue a 
core discipline of finance departments, describes it as "a really powerful signal".
Acciona wins admirers with plan to make sustainability add up
Acciona was not alone in leaving sustainability with marketing, Fries says. But, as policymakers set aggressive 
environmental targets and regulators move to demand disclosure, ESG issues are being seen as material factors in 
the financial wellbeing of a business.
CDP, a not-for-profit group that runs a sustainability disclosure system used by about 6,000 businesses worldwide, 
has estimated that the financial risk from climate change to the world's 500 biggest companies comes to just less 
than $1tn, based on survey answers. But climate-related opportunities outweighed that risk at $2.1tn.
Giving ESG the finance that those who such integration to find another
With such sums at stake, some investors are demanding as much rigour in measuring performance on ESG criteria 
as they do for returns on investment or profitability.
They are also demanding oversight of sustainability should sit at board level rather than being farmed out to 
managers with little executive power.
Legal & General Investment Management asks that all of its portfolio companies have at least one board director 
focused on sustainability or they risk a protest vote.
According to José Angel Tejero, Acciona's chief finance officer who has taken over the sustainability team, the 
decision to merge the roles was in part to address this growing demand from investors.
But it was also born from the recognition that the opportunities to gain a competitive edge with sustainable initiatives 
are growing; not just in new products and services, but in debt finance that pegs interest rates to whether a 
company meets or misses ESG targets.
For many companies, ensuring the new ESG lending conditions are realistic, and can be measured and met, is a 
new discipline - especially when the world is divided over standards for sustainability reporting.
Which is why it makes sense for Acciona and others to integrate sustainability with finance. After all, it is the finance 
department that manages risk, sets budgets and distils the information that guides investment decisions. Mervyn 
King, a South African who is chair emeritus of the International Integrated Reporting Council, argues that the CFO 
is the "true change maker" of a company.
Not all companies will choose to hand oversight to the finance director. But their boards will have to assume greater 
responsibility to reassure the investment community that there is top-level accountability.
Worryingly, PwC's last annual corporate directors survey found that more than half the board members questioned 
admitted that ESG was not regularly addressed at meetings, while close to 60 per cent did not believe disclosure 
should be a priority.
These are no longer sustainable attitudes. Unless company boards demonstrate willingness to be directly 
accountable for oversight of sustainability, investors may question their commitment to change.

W arren Buffett doesn't admit to many mistakes. Asked over the weekend about his decision to dump $4bn in US 
airline shares last May, the Berkshire Hathaway chief executive responded drily: "I do not consider it a great 
moment in Berkshire's history."
Shares in American, United and Southwest Airlines have all more than doubled in a year, and Delta's stock price 
had as well until a recent tumble brought its gain below 100 per cent. Though most US carriers are still burning 
through cash, they are unabashedly enthusiastic about the future. "The worst is behind us," Southwest chief 
executive Gary Kelly said at firstquarter earnings, and American's chief
Doug Parker predicted "the pace of recovery is accelerating".
Across the Atlantic, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr tried to sound upbeat. "We do look to the future with quite some 
confidence and optimism," he said. But he also had to reassure investors that "this unprecedented crisis forces us 
to overcome our known weaknesses, and it will make us stronger".
Although they are linked by alliances, the big US and European airlines are facing very different fates. The 
pandemic has exacerbated structural differences between the two markets, putting the US carriers in a stronger 
position to adjust to a radically altered environment.
A tale of two airline markets
By 2019, North America was highly profitable. Most of the big carriers had used Chapter 11 bankruptcy to cut costs. 
Fifteen years of consolidation had left the top five carriers (including Air Canada) with 75 per cent of capacity, 
allowing them to boost prices.
In Europe, cut-price operator Ryanair had already muscled its way into the top five, a group which controls just 51 
per cent of capacity, and other low-cost carriers were nipping at their heels.
Lufthansa and IAG, parent of British Airways, are fighting back with their own low-price arms, but those are a work 
in progress. European flag carriers depend much more on long-haul and business passengers to turn a profit.
Enter the pandemic. Global passenger traffic dropped by two-thirds last year, as measured by revenue-passenger 
kilometres, which takes into account traveller numbers and the length of flights. Carriers tapped government aid 
programmes, sold planes and furloughed or let staff go to stay afloat.
Winter lockdowns dashed hopes for a quick recovery. Industry group Iata last month projected that global demand 
in 2021 would only rebound to 43 per cent of 2019 levels, and the industry as a whole would continue to lose 
money.
But drill down and a transatlantic split appears. US domestic demand is expected to hit 2019 levels for the second 
half, while internal European demand will languish below 50 per cent. And US airlines will narrow their collective 
2021 loss to 2.7 per cent of revenue, while European airlines will post loss margins of 19 per cent.
Rapid vaccine rollout and pent up desire to see families are prompting Americans to start booking domestic flights, 
as well as some beach vacations. More than 1.6m people went through US airport screening on Sunday, the most 
since March www.2020.No wonder the country last week saw the launch of its first freestanding new airline since 
2007.
The situation is different in Europe, where vaccines have been slower to arrive and flights last week were down 64 
per cent from 2019. Uncertainty about UK travel rules has forced Heathrow airport to plan for anywhere from 13m to 
36m passengers this year, down from 81m in 2019. Low-cost carriers are better able to move routes around; 
easyJet is promising free last-minute changes to help avoid quarantine.
"Historically we compared the US and Chinese domestic markets with shorthaul travel within the single European 
sky. The pandemic has been a sobering reminder that the latter is at heart an international market and much more 
complex to restart," says Geoffrey Weston of Bain & Co.
Business travel remains deeply depressed everywhere. Given the rise in videoconferencing, some analysts forecast 
that demand will still be 10 per cent below 2019 levels in 2025. Lufthansa, which used to draw 45 per cent of 
revenue from corporate travellers, is scaling back high-end offerings and expanding premium economy to attract 
priceconscious small businesses and splurging leisure travellers.
Having missed the US rebound, Buffett says he "still wouldn't want to buy the airline business international[ly]". But 
the slowdown will not last, even in Europe. Watch for the strongest carriers to expand organically. Why buy a failing 
competitor when landing slots, planes and crew are already going cheap? brooke.masters@ft.com
US carriers are in a better position than Europe's to adjust to a radically altered travel environment

Ryanair PLC's (LON:RYA) increasing market can trigger a surge in profits over the medium-term for the low-cost 
airline, predicts Credit Suisse.
The Swiss bank expects Ryanair's market share in Europe will rise towards 25% by the mid-late decade, which will 
mean two things: The need to discount will fall helping it to push up its average fare in 2020 of (EURO)37.
Also, if Ryanair is carrying is one in every four passengers in the European short-haul market, Credit Suisse 
believes there is huge potential for the airline to partner with third parties such as retailers and to exploit its brand 
loyalty.
"Loyalty plan values can structurally boost liquidity now - equity values later but RYA could do this in a "low cost" 
manner.
"With each 1% gain in revenue per pax [passenger] worth 8% to FY20A profit, sensitivities are compelling," the 
broker says.
Target price for the shares is (EURO)17.91 against a market price today of (EURO)17.11, up 2.8%.

Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) may have had their 
spirits lifted by traffic statistics for April, which showed something of a recovery in passenger numbers as the effects 
of the Coronavirus pandemic on travel showed signs of loosening.
In an update for the month, Ryanair said it had carried 1mln passengers during the month, up from just 0.04mln a 
year ago, although on a rolling annual basis passenger numbers were still down 79% at 135.1mln. The airline 
operated 8,000 flights in April with a load factor of 67%.
READ: Ryanair has compelling outlook for summer 2022, says Credit Suisse
Meanwhile, Wizz Air saw a similar trend, with passenger numbers moving up to 564,634 in April from 78,382 a year 
ago, although its load factor fell to 59.2% from 74.3% and the carrier said it was operating at just 22% of capacity.
While the passenger numbers are still heavily down on pre-pandemic levels (Ryanair carried 13.5mln passengers in 
April 2019), the budget airlines may be encouraged by the uptick in demand ahead of an expected relaxation of 
travel restrictions to and from the UK later this month, as well as reports that the European Union is planning to 
welcome fully vaccinated holidaymakers over the summer period in a bid to boost tourism.
Shares in Ryanair rose 0.2% to (EURO)16.58 in mid-morning trading on Wednesday, while Wizz Air climbed 1% to 
4,864p.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Wednesday reported a significant increase 
in passenger numbers for April from a year before, as global travel restrictions  in place for a year now show start to 
be eased.
Irish budget airline Ryanair posted 1.0 million passengers for April, a sharp rise from a mere 40,000 in the same 
month a year before. The group said it had operated over 8,000 flights with a 67% load factor last month, as the 
pandemic continues to damp air traffic.
Ryanair's rolling 12-month total was 28.5 million at a 71% load factor. The passenger total was down 79% from 
135.1 million in the prior 12 months.
Wizz Air, meanwhile, reported 564,634 passengers in April, up significantly from 78,382 in April 2020. This was at a 
load factor of 59.2%, down 15.1 percentage points from 74.3% a year before.
During the month, the Central and Eastern Europe-focused airline operated at 22% of its capacity.
Wizz Air's rolling 12-month passenger total was 10.7 million, a 71% drop from 36.8 million the 12 months before, 
while the load factor declined 30.0 percentage points to 63.6% from 93.6%.
On Tuesday, the European Commission proposed to ease restrictions on travel to countries in the bloc amid 
progressing Covid-19 vaccination campaigns and lower infection rates.
And the UK government's "green list" of countries to which people can travel without having to isolate for 14 days 
on their return is expected to be released this week. Reports suggested the list could include about a dozen 
countries, although some newspapers suggest it could be fewer than 10.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair and Wizz Air see improved passenger numbers in April
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were marginally lower at EUR16.55 on Wednesday in London, while Wizz Air shares 
were 1.2% higher at 4,872.00 pence.

The direct routes for leisure and business travel will be operated at Lithuania's Vilnius (VNO), Kaunas (KUN) and

in Europe show signs of recovery in passenger aviation. Stikliunas said: "Not only are people longing for travel, but 
they are aware even clearer that the virus will not go away quickly, so they more often decide not to wait and start 
looking for a destination to fly to. 
We believe that the offers of new directions will meet their needs. "In May, new routes will be offered from Vilnius 
and Kaunas airports. The directions will be relevant both for those flying in popular directions among emigrants or 
for business purposes and for passengers wishing to have a holiday." At Vilnius Airport, the Irish airline Ryanair 
plans to offer direct flights to Athens, Paris and Oslo from its air gate starting from May. Flights to Moscow (Aeroflot) 
started on 30 April. Lithuanian Airports stated that passengers will also have direct flights from Vilnius Airport to

Ryanair issued a (EURO)1.2 billion ($1.5 billion) Eurobond on 18 May, under its (EURO)5 billion Euro medium-term 
note programme (EMTN).
The bond, which has a five-year tenor and a fixed coupon of 0.875%, will be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, 
Ryanair says in a statement.
"We are pleased with the success of our latest, low-cost, unsecured bond issue. This (EURO)1.2 billion transaction, 
which was multiple times oversubscribed, was keenly priced at a coupon of 0.875%," Ryanair's chief financial 
officer (CFO) Neil Sorahan says.
Initial price talk on the five-year senior unsecured notes was MS+150 basis points (bps). Guidance was MS+125 
bps area and the bond was launched at MS+120 bps. The tranche was sold at a 99.49 issue price.
Investor orders reached $5.2 billion, according to early data, indicating that the transaction was oversubscribed 4.3 
times.
The joint bookrunners in the placement were BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Commerzbank.
Ryanair will use the proceeds of the bond sale to repay its existing Eurobond and cover fleet capital expenditure, 
which involves the delivery of 60 Boeing 737 Max aircraft between now and summer 2022.
The successful Eurobond financing follows another (EURO)850 million bond, at a fixed coupon of 2.875%, in 
September last year. At the time the five-year unsecured bond was 4.4 times oversubscribed.
The carrier, which is rated BBB by both S&P and Fitch Ratings, has an (EURO)850 million bond maturing on 17 
June, according to Airfinance Journal's Deal Tracker. The (EURO)850 million 1.875% unsecured bond was issued 
in June 2014.
The Irish low-cost carrier also has a (EURO)850 million 1.125% 2015 senior unsecured bond maturing on 10 March 
2023. Its 2017 6.5-year bond worth (EURO)750 million, at a fixed coupon of 1.125%, matures on 15 August 2023.
Ryanair's £600 million borrowing under the UK CCFF matures on 22 May 2022, according to Deal Tracker.

Ryanair preps return to Eurobond market
Ryanair preps return to Eurobond market
AirFinance Journal

Length: 349 words

Ryanair Group is looking to return to the Eurobond market with plans to launch another bond in the coming days, its 
chief executive officer Michael O'Leary says during an analyst call on 17 May.
O'Leary says proceeds of the bond will be used to repay its existing Eurobond and cover fleet capital expenditure.
Ryanair issued a (EURO)850 million ($1 billion) Eurobond last September with a five-year tenor at a fixed coupon of 
2.875% as part of its (EURO)3 billion medium-term note (EMTN) programme.
"There's a lot of liquidity chasing yield at this point in time, we feel now as we start to get ready to ramp-up for 
deliveries, particularly in the second half of this year and into next year, that a five-year bond, benchmark-size, 
makes a lot of sense," Ryanair's chief financial officer Neil Sorahan says.
O'Leary reveals that the group has turned cash positive as of May with load factor for the month at around 74% to 
75%, adding this is expected to be maintained into summer this year.
He indicates that a roughly 70%-plus load factor in July and August would be required to stay breakeven, adding 
that load factor will range from between 60% and 75% during the peak summer months provided there are no 
"untoward" travel restrictions.
The group ended the 12 months to 31 March with total liquidity of (EURO)3.2 billion.
737 Max delays
Meanwhile, O'Leary has slammed US manufacturer Boeing for continued delays in receiving its first Boeing 737 
Max aircraft ahead of the summer, arguing the airline has been "kept in the dark" over delivery updates.
He says the first delivery is now scheduled for 26 May but admits that the company has "no idea whether we will 
get any aircraft" this month.
"We hoped to have 14 this summer, now we don't know if we'll have any," O'Leary says, adding the airline is 
"reluctant" to begin accepting deliveries in June as it will be busy working on its own recovery efforts and volumes.
Ryanair preps return to Eurobond market
O'Leary notes these are short term issues and that the group is still confident it will incorporate 60 aircraft of the 
type by April and June next year ahead of the summer 2022 season.

EU further scrutinises KLM and TAP state aid
EU further scrutinises KLM and TAP state aid
AirFinance Journal

Length: 250 words
Byline: Hugh Davies
Body
The European Union (EU) General Court has temporarily stayed EU approval for KLM and TAP Air Portugal state 
aid measures, pending the adoption of a new decision by the European Commission (EC).
In a ruling linked to a challenge brought forward by Ryanair, the Luxembourg-based court found that the EC in both 
cases failed to provide reasons for state aid compatibility with the internal market "to the requisite legal standard".
However, the court suspended its immediate application for annulment due to the impacts of the Covid-19 
pandemic on the air transport sector and the Dutch and Portuguese economies.
It has requested in both cases that the EU provide a more complete reasoning for the provision of state aid to the 
airline groups.
The court requested further clarification on shortcomings in EC statements as to whether the beneficiary of the aid 
belonged to a group, whether the difficulties faced by the beneficiary are intrinsic and are not the result of an 
arbitrary allocation of costs within the group, and whether those difficulties are too serious to be dealt with by that 
group itself.
Government bailout measures for flag carriers KLM and TAP are valued at (EURO)3.4 billion ($4.1 billion) and 
(EURO)1.2 billion, respectively.
In similar challenges brought by Ryanair against Finnair and SAS last month, the same court found that state aid 
measures for the Scandinavian airlines were in line with EU rules as they were proportionate to mitigate damages 
suffered by individual companies.

Ryanair swings to nearly $1bn loss

Ryanair Group has posted an (EURO)815 million ($990 million) net loss for the year ended 31 March, compared 
with a profit of over (EURO)1 billion in the previous year.
Including a (EURO)200 million ineffectiveness charge on fuel and currency hedges during the year, the European 
low-cost airline group recorded a net loss of over (EURO)1 billion.
Revenue also fell 81% year on year to (EURO)1.6 billion with load factor decreasing 24 percentage points to 71%.
Operating expenses declined 66% to (EURO)2.5 billion, with an 80% reduction in fuel costs to (EURO)543 million 
and a 57% cut in staff costs.
Depreciation was 24% lower at (EURO)571 million primarily due to lower amortisation owing to reduced aircraft 
utilisation.
Aircraft rentals fell by 82% to (EURO)6.7 million due to 11 fewer leased 737 aircraft in the fleet.
Ryanair Group's operating fleet stood at 451 aircraft as of 31 March, including 422 737-family aircraft and 29 Airbus 
A320 aircraft.
Liquidity stood at (EURO)3.2 billion at the end of March, including cash of (EURO)2.7 billion, with over 85% of 
Ryanair's 737 fleet unencumbered.
Ryanair said the 2022 financial year "continues to be challenging", with uncertainty over when and where Covid-19-
related travel restrictions would be eased preventing the company from providing full-year guidance.
The group is "cautiously" expecting a "close to breakeven" net result for the current financial year, provided the 
successful rollout of vaccines this summer allows for the easing of European government travel restrictions on intra-
European traffic in time for the peak travel period.
The group forecasts between five and six million passengers in the first quarter of  fiscal year 2022.
Visibility is, however, "close to zero" for the remainder of the year despite an uptick in bookings since early April, 
with total passenger traffic likely to be on the lower end of its previous 80 million to 120 million guidance.
Ryanair swings to nearly $1bn loss
Ryanair expects intra-European air travel capacity to be materially lower "for the foreseeable future", creating 
opportunities for it to extend airport growth incentives, as the group takes delivery of 210 new 737 Max aircraft.
The company increased its firm order for the 737 Max from 135 to 210 aircraft in December last year while securing 
further price discounts. 
"Reasonable and fair compensation" was also agreed with Boeing for two-year delivery delays to the aircraft, 
Ryanair said.
The group lowered cash burn in 2021 by cutting costs, participating in European Union government payroll support 
schemes, cancelling share buybacks and deferring non-essential capital expenditure.
Over the past year, Ryanair pursued around (EURO)1.95 billion in new finance to enable it to capitalise on growth 
opportunities.
These includes a (EURO)400 million share placing, an (EURO)850 million Eurobond and £600 million from the 
CCFF, while cash was further boosted by supplier reimbursements during the year.
Gross debt increased by (EURO)1.2 billion to (EURO)5.4 billion, offset by secured debt and lease liability 
payments.
Net debt was (EURO)2.3 billion at year end, which included current and non-current maturities of debt and lease 
liabilities, less restricted cash and cash and cash equivalents.

Come Fly the World: The Women of Pan Am at War and Peace by Julia Cooke Icon Books £16.99, 274 pages
I don't think of myself as sex symbol," says a stewardess in Julia Cooke's social history of Pan American Airways 
and the female flight attendants who flew with the carrier in the 1960s and 70s. "I think of myself as someone who 
knows how to open the door of a 747 in the dark, upside down, and in the water."
That comment was made to a journalist some 50 years ago - but even in the 21st century, airlines continue to 
exploit the stereotype of the sexually alluring stewardess to promote their business.
Aireurope still likes to surround chief executive Tony Fernandes with young women as he signs multibillion-dollar 
deals for new aircraft. VietJet, run by Vietnam's richest woman, had its air hostesses pose in bikinis for a publicity 
stunt in 2011. And Ryanair believes the best way to sum up the green credentials proclaimed in its 2020 
environmental policy document is to photo-shop three young, attractive stewardesses saluting in front of a forested 
landscape.
Haven't we moved on? In many ways, we have, according to Cooke's entertaining trot through the golden age of 
aviation. It is hard to imagine that a global carrier would today argue in a US - that only attractive "young girls" could 
"add to the pleasure of the trip, the loveliness of the environment or the ego of the male passenger".
Flying the flag Sex symbols or diplomats? Peggy Hollinger on the stewardesses of Pan Am
The days of sacking stewardesses when they hit 35 or got married - because, according to management, wives 
tended to put on weight - are also long gone. A stewardess in the 1960s worked on average for just 32.4 months. 
Yet in 2017, a trim 81-year-old Bette Nash celebrated her 60th anniversary as a flight attendant.
Come Fly the World tells the story of Pan Am's heyday through the stories of some of its stewardesses - one a 
science major, one with a degree in education - all well-educated, multilingual and hungry to explore the world. At a 
time when just 6-8 per cent of American women had college degrees, roughly 10 per cent of Pan Am stewardesses 
had attended graduate school. Being a flight attendant offered an "alternative to the postwar straitjacket" of 
marriage and children.
Stewardesses were expected to look and act like the epitome of conventional femininity - a distinctly white ideal in 
1960s and 70s America. They often drew the scorn of feminists for the titillating imagery used in ad campaigns such 
as National Airlines' "Fly Me" or Braniff International's Air Strip (yes, an air hostess changing uniforms to the tune of 
"The Stripper"). But these women were also among the first to use the newly established Equal Employment 
Opportunities Commission to challenge gender-based discrimination.
It may sound harsh to say that the individual stories of the smart and capable women chosen by Cooke is the least 
interesting part of her tale. Come Fly the World really takes off when she begins to look at the social and political 
context.
These women were not merely stewardesses, she argues, but diplomats serving US national interests in times of 
both war and peace. "Pan Am was the American flag, for all purposes an extension of the US government," Cooke 
quotes a CIA officer as saying. The state - via the War Department - funded the creation of subsidiaries in Africa 
and South America that established it as the first "and, for decades to come, the only commercial airline to circle the 
globe".
Some risked their lives in Vietnam to pick up soldiers on leave. Flights could be targeted by snipers, and 
stewardesses were given the status of second lieutenants to ensure protection under the Geneva Convention 
should they be captured. Their memories indicate the grit required for the job. One recalls a flight into Vietnam 
organised by Ed Daly, chief executive of World Airways, to evacuate women and children. Hundreds of refugees 
scrambled to board the aircraft but as flight attendants reached down to pull people up, shots were fired and 
grenades exploded. The strongest climbed over the weakest, and out of 268 people who managed to board, there 
were only five women and three small children.
Cooke also sheds light on the operation to bring Vietnamese orphans - many the unrecognised children of GIs - to 
America. The experiences left
Cooke's protagonists marked for life. One former stewardess falls ill every year on the anniversary of Operation 
Babylift. Others decided to quit aviation, the harsh realities of a turbulent world creating a yearning for stability.
Come Fly the World is no detailed academic treatise. It is a much more personal tale, entertaining in parts but 
which, like the memories at its core, can be scant and disjointed. Yet Cooke succeeds in driving home the fact that 
these women were far from the vamps they were all too often portrayed in popular culture. Unfortunately, decades 
on, it is still too early to claim a definitive victory in that battle.

Come Fly the World: The Women of Pan Am at War and Peace by Julia Cooke Icon Books £16.99, 274 pages
I don't think of myself as sex symbol," says a stewardess in Julia Cooke's social history of Pan American Airways 
and the female flight attendants who flew with the carrier in the 1960s and 70s. "I think of myself as someone who 
knows how to open the door of a 747 in the dark, upside down, and in the water."
That comment was made to a journalist some 50 years ago - but even in the 21st century, airlines continue to 
exploit the stereotype of the sexually alluring stewardess to promote their business.
AirAsia still likes to surround chief executive Tony Fernandes with young women as he signs multibillion-dollar 
deals for new aircraft. VietJet, run by Vietnam's richest woman, had its air hostesses pose in bikinis for a publicity 
stunt in 2011. And Ryanair believes the best way to sum up the green credentials proclaimed in its 2020 
environmental policy document is to photo-shop three young, attractive stewardesses saluting in front of a forested 
landscape.
Haven't we moved on? In many ways, we have, according to Cooke's entertaining trot through the golden age of 
aviation. It is hard to imagine that a global carrier would today argue in a US - that only attractive "young girls" could 
"add to the pleasure of the trip, the loveliness of the environment or the ego of the male passenger".
Flying the flag; Sex symbols or diplomats? Peggy Hollinger on the stewardesses of Pan Am
The days of sacking stewardesses when they hit 35 or got married - because, according to management, wives 
tended to put on weight - are also long gone. A stewardess in the 1960s worked on average for just 32.4 months. 
Yet in 2017, a trim 81-year-old Bette Nash celebrated her 60th anniversary as a flight attendant.
Come Fly the World tells the story of Pan Am's heyday through the stories of some of its stewardesses - one a 
science major, one with a degree in education - all well-educated, multilingual and hungry to explore the world. At a 
time when just 6-8 per cent of American women had college degrees, roughly 10 per cent of Pan Am stewardesses 
had attended graduate school. Being a flight attendant offered an "alternative to the postwar straitjacket" of 
marriage and children.
Stewardesses were expected to look and act like the epitome of conventional femininity - a distinctly white ideal in 
1960s and 70s America. They often drew the scorn of feminists for the titillating imagery used in ad campaigns such 
as National Airlines' "Fly Me" or Braniff International's Air Strip (yes, an air hostess changing uniforms to the tune of 
"The Stripper"). But these women were also among the first to use the newly established Equal Employment 
Opportunities Commission to challenge gender-based discrimination.
It may sound harsh to say that the individual stories of the smart and capable women chosen by Cooke is the least 
interesting part of her tale. Come Fly the World really takes off when she begins to look at the social and political 
context.
These women were not merely stewardesses, she argues, but diplomats serving US national interests in times of 
both war and peace. "Pan Am was the American flag, for all purposes an extension of the US government," Cooke 
quotes a CIA officer as saying. The state - via the War Department - funded the creation of subsidiaries in Africa 
and South America that established it as the first "and, for decades to come, the only commercial airline to circle the 
globe".
Some risked their lives in Vietnam to pick up soldiers on leave. Flights could be targeted by snipers, and 
stewardesses were given the status of second lieutenants to ensure protection under the Geneva Convention 
should they be captured. Their memories indicate the grit required for the job. One recalls a flight into Vietnam 
organised by Ed Daly, chief executive of World Airways, to evacuate women and children. Hundreds of refugees 
scrambled to board the aircraft but as flight attendants reached down to pull people up, shots were fired and 
grenades exploded. The strongest climbed over the weakest, and out of 268 people who managed to board, there 
were only five women and three small children.
Cooke also sheds light on the operation to bring Vietnamese orphans - many the unrecognised children of GIs - to 
America. The experiences left
Cooke's protagonists marked for life. One former stewardess falls ill every year on the anniversary of Operation 
Babylift. Others decided to quit aviation, the harsh realities of a turbulent world creating a yearning for stability.
Come Fly the World is no detailed academic treatise. It is a much more personal tale, entertaining in parts but 
which, like the memories at its core, can be scant and disjointed. Yet Cooke succeeds in driving home the fact that 
these women were far from the vamps they were all too often portrayed in popular culture. Unfortunately, decades 
on, it is still too early to claim a definitive victory in that battle.

Greek islands Greece, where a fifth of jobs and GDP depend on tourism, is currently one of the most open 
countries in Europe - with EU residents, as well as those from the UK, US, Israel, Serbia and the UAE already 
allowed to travel provided they have proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before arrival or that 
they have been fully vaccinated. Tourists from the rest of the world are due to be allowed to enter from May 15.
In March, tourism minister Harry Theoharis announced that, as soon as the most vulnerable group had been 
vaccinated, the country would be prioritising those working in tourism. Authorities have also been targeting their 
vaccination programme, dubbed Operation Freedom, at tourism-dependent islands, using army planes, helicopters 
and coastguard boats to manage the complex task of delivering jabs. Vaccinations on islands with fewer than 1,000 
residents were due to be completed by the end of April, with the effort then accelerating to larger islands. The plans 
seem to have won the confidence of airlines: Ryanair is launching services from UK airports to Kos, Santorini and 
Corfu; Delta is due to restart flights to Athens from New York on May 28 and launch a direct route from its main 
hub, Atlanta, at the start of July. "We are more than optimistic, we are ready," Theoharis told a recent travel 
conference. Israel's early vaccine rollout means it currently has a higher proportion of fully vaccinated people than 
any other country besides the Seychelles, at 56 per cent (the EU, by way of comparison, is on 8 per cent, the US on 
29 per cent). Tourism minister Orit Farkash-Hacohen held a press conference last week announcing plans to 
capitalise on its vaccine advantage. "We cannot miss this opportunity - and as minister of tourism I won't," said

Farkash-Hacohen. The US, UK and UAE will be key targets, with digital billboard advertisements soon to go up in 
Times Square, Piccadilly Circus and Dubai (tagline: "2020 Holy Moses, 2021 Holy Land") as part of a global 
campaign. The government will also offer incentives to airlines to fly into Eilat, and will promote a series of large 
international events, including the Pride Parade in Tel Aviv, a music festival in Timna Park and a joint Israel-UAE 
cycling race.
The timeline for reopening is relatively cautious, with the first small groups of vaccinated travellers arriving on May 
23, and vaccinated independent travellers only allowed to follow in July. American Airlines is due to start flights from 
New York and Miami in May, and in early April Etihad inaugurated the first ever service from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv. 
More generally, Israel's travel hotspots have never seemed more ready - from the increasingly cool ancient city of 
Jaffa to the vast and wild Negev desert, where the smart Six Senses Shaharut is finally due to open in August. 
Malta A 2018 stint as European Capital of Culture and a series of flashy architecture projects, including the 
upcoming
MICAS art museum, have brought some much-needed buzz to the evocative capital, Valletta, and raised Malta's 
tourism profile. The Mediterranean island has also been handy with its vaccination programme, with a higher 
proportion of fully vaccinated citizens than any other European country bar the microstates of Monaco and San 
Marino.
Earlier this month health minister Chris Fearne said the accelerating programme meant the country would reach 
herd immunity by June rather than September as previously thought. Borders are already open to tourists from 50 
countries worldwide, subject to a negative test, and from June fully vaccinated visitors from those countries will be 
free to enter without a test.
Eager to get a head start on the competition, the Maltese authorities are also offering to pay visitors who come for 
at least three nights this summer. According to plans laid out by tourism minister Clayton Bartolo, anyone booking a 
fivestar hotel in Malta will get a (EURO)200 handout (funded half by the government, half by the hotel), while four-
star hotels will offer (EURO)150 and three-stars (EURO)100. Alaska's vaccination effort has brought tales of 
vaccine supplies arriving on bush planes, water taxis and snowmobiles - with remote corners like the isolated St 
Lawrence Island having some of the highest vaccination rates in the US. The state is now planning to extend that 
drive to visitors, with Governor Mike Dunleavy recently announcing that tourists will be able to get free vaccinations 
from June 1 on arrival at Juneau, Fairbanks, Ketchikan and Anchorage airports. Both domestic and international 
tourists will be eligible for the Pfizer or Moderna shots, and those staying for three weeks or more will also be able 
to get their second shot in the state.
Alaska's move comes partly out of desperation. The state has been hit particularly hard by the continuing ban on 
cruise ships, which brought 1.3m passengers in 2019, more than half the total number of visitors. One factor in 
Alaska's favour might be that many of its smartest accommodation options are naturally social distanced: like the 
Ultima Thule Lodge or Sheldon Chalet, deep in the wilderness and reachable only by bush plane or helicopter. 
Gibraltar Life in the diminutive British Overseas
Territory at the southern tip of Spain has already returned more-or-less to normal, with restaurants and bars open 
(inside and out), no restrictions on size of gatherings and the cinema reopening this weekend. Gibraltar announced 
itself free of any Covid-19 cases on April 8, and it has topped global vaccine league tables with 95 per cent of adults 
fully vaccinated. Those figures mean it is the surest bet of any destination to be win "green" status on the UK's 
trafficlight travel system, due to be announced in early May and to take effect from May 17. Green means tourists 
can return to the UK without quarantine, though they will still have to be tested.
That status will be crucial to Gibraltar: the UK is the most important source market for tourists after Spain, with 
which the land border is already open. Airlines are predicting "the Rock" will find strong demand: new routes this 
summer include Wizz Air from Luton, Eastern Airways from Birmingham and Southampton and British Airways from 
London City.
Tourists wanted With high rates of vaccination, plus offers of cash and free jabs for visitors, these destinations 
hope to kickstart tourism's recovery. By Toby....
Madeira While politicians in Portugal have been vocal about welcoming visitors without quarantine, the mainland 
still lags behind the autonomous region of Madeira. It opened its borders to international tourists on July 1 last year, 
with the requirement either to have negative test in the 72 hours before arrival or to take a free test on landing. In 
March it introduced a "green corridor", meaning that arriving tourists with proof of full vaccination would be free to 
enter without testing or quarantine.
Madeira has been pushing hard to rid itself of a slightly fusty reputation, with a new brand identity unveiled this 
month and moves to play up its appeal to surfers, adventure travellers and digital nomads. Take sleepy Ponta Do 
Sol, which has been reimagined as the "Digital Nomad Village", with free workspaces for up to 100 people staying 
more than a month. Iceland Tourism has been booming in Iceland since 2010, so much so that some Icelanders 
saw last year's 75 per cent drop in visitor numbers as a welcome break for the sometimes crowded waterfalls, 
geysers and hot springs. But the country is nevertheless desperate to get its foreign visitors back, as well as the 
$3.8bn they brought to the country in 2019.
On March 18, Iceland opened its borders to visitors from any country who could prove they had been fully 
vaccinated, becoming one of the first countries in the the world to do so. At the start of June, those rules are likely 
to relax further, meaning most passengers will be able to visit quarantine-free with a negative Covid-19 test. Iceland 
is also targeting remote workers, with a new long-term visa offering 180-day stays with no income tax liability to 
non-EU residents earning at least IKr1m (£5,850) per month.
The country's wide-open spaces seem likely to appeal to post-lockdown travellers. US airlines, in particular, are 
anticipating demand: Delta is adding a new daily service from Boston to Reykjavik in May, and reopening routes 
from New York and Minneapolis; while United Airlines is starting a new route from Chicago in July.
The Seychelles A heavy reliance on tourism, which supplies just under a quarter of its GDP, has spurred the 
Seychelles' vaccination programme: with 58 per cent of the population fully vaccinated, it is the leading nation. That 
rate gave the Indian Ocean country the confidence to reopen its borders to tourists on March 25, with no 
requirement to be vaccinated or quarantine but the proviso of a negative PCR test taken in the 72 hours pre-arrival.
The policy applies to visitors from anywhere in the world apart from those coming from South Africa, Brazil, India, 
Pakistan and Bangladesh. While arrivals dropped by 70 per cent last year, there are signs that this one will be much 
better, with new air routes to the islands including an Aeroflot flight from Moscow that began in early April.
The Maldives With its island resorts naturally suited to social distancing, and with tourism directly and indirectly 
accounting for two-thirds of GDP, the Maldives opened its borders to all visitors in July, subject to a negative test. 
Some resorts reported a bumper winter season - Soneva Fushi and its sister property, Soneva Jani, saw occupancy 
up 16 per cent in November against the same month in 2019 - and in April the country announced fully vaccinated 
tourists would be able to enter without testing. Tourism officials now hope to attract 1.5m visitors this year, 
compared to 1.9m in 2019.
A higher proportion of the population (54 per cent) than in the UK or US have had at least one jab, and in April, 
tourism minister Abdulla Mausoom said that among frontline tourism workers the figure was approaching 90 per 
cent. Once all locals are vaccinated, the country will roll out its "3V" tourism strategy: "Visit, Vaccinate, Vacation", 
with visitors offered free jabs on arrival.
Confidence in the tourism recovery seems high: Ritz-Carlton, for example, is pressing ahead with the opening of a 
new 100-villa resort in the Fari islands on June 1, the brand's first hotel in the Maldives. The US-based Capella 
hotel group will open the flagship property in its new Patina brand on the same archipelago on May 18.

fivestar hotel in Malta will get a (EURO)200 handout (funded half by the government, half by the hotel), while four-
star hotels will offer (EURO)150 and three-stars (EURO)100. Alaska's vaccination effort has brought tales of 
vaccine supplies arriving on bush planes, water taxis and snowmobiles - with remote corners like the isolated St 
Lawrence Island having some of the highest vaccination rates in the US. The state is now planning to extend that 
drive to visitors, with Governor Mike Dunleavy recently announcing that tourists will be able to get free vaccinations 
from June 1 on arrival at Juneau, Fairbanks, Ketchikan and Anchorage airports. Both domestic and international 
tourists will be eligible for the Pfizer or Moderna shots, and those staying for three weeks or more will also be able 
to get their second shot in the state.
Alaska's move comes partly out of desperation. The state has been hit particularly hard by the continuing ban on 
cruise ships, which brought 1.3m passengers in 2019, more than half the total number of visitors. One factor in 
Alaska's favour might be that many of its smartest accommodation options are naturally social distanced: like the 
Ultima Thule Lodge or Sheldon Chalet, deep in the wilderness and reachable only by bush plane or helicopter. 
Gibraltar Life in the diminutive British Overseas
Territory at the southern tip of Spain has already returned more-or-less to normal, with restaurants and bars open 
(inside and out), no restrictions on size of gatherings and the cinema reopening this weekend. Gibraltar announced 
itself free of any Covid-19 cases on April 8, and it has topped global vaccine league tables with 95 per cent of adults 
fully vaccinated. Those figures mean it is the surest bet of any destination to be win "green" status on the UK's 
trafficlight travel system, due to be announced in early May and to take effect from May 17. Green means tourists 
can return to the UK without quarantine, though they will still have to be tested.
That status will be crucial to Gibraltar: the UK is the most important source market for tourists after Spain, with 
which the land border is already open. Airlines are predicting "the Rock" will find strong demand: new routes this 
summer include Wizz Air from Luton, Eastern Airways from Birmingham and Southampton and British Airways from 
London City.

Madeira While politicians in Portugal have been vocal about welcoming visitors without quarantine, the mainland 
still lags behind the autonomous region of Madeira. It opened its borders to international tourists on July 1 last year, 
with the requirement either to have negative test in the 72 hours before arrival or to take a free test on landing. In 
March it introduced a "green corridor", meaning that arriving tourists with proof of full vaccination would be free to 
enter without testing or quarantine.
Madeira has been pushing hard to rid itself of a slightly fusty reputation, with a new brand identity unveiled this 
month and moves to play up its appeal to surfers, adventure travellers and digital nomads. Take sleepy Ponta Do 
Sol, which has been reimagined as the "Digital Nomad Village", with free workspaces for up to 100 people staying 
more than a month. Iceland Tourism has been booming in Iceland since 2010, so much so that some Icelanders 
saw last year's 75 per cent drop in visitor numbers as a welcome break for the sometimes crowded waterfalls, 
geysers and hot springs. But the country is nevertheless desperate to get its foreign visitors back, as well as the 
$3.8bn they brought to the country in 2019.
On March 18, Iceland opened its borders to visitors from any country who could prove they had been fully 
vaccinated, becoming one of the first countries in the the world to do so. At the start of June, those rules are likely 
to relax further, meaning most passengers will be able to visit quarantine-free with a negative Covid-19 test. Iceland 
is also targeting remote workers, with a new long-term visa offering 180-day stays with no income tax liability to 
non-EU residents earning at least IKr1m (£5,850) per month.
The country's wide-open spaces seem likely to appeal to post-lockdown travellers. US airlines, in particular, are 
anticipating demand: Delta is adding a new daily service from Boston to Reykjavik in May, and reopening routes 
from New York and Minneapolis; while United Airlines is starting a new route from Chicago in July.
The Seychelles A heavy reliance on tourism, which supplies just under a quarter of its GDP, has spurred the 
Seychelles' vaccination programme: with 58 per cent of the population fully vaccinated, it is the leading nation. That 
rate gave the Indian Ocean country the confidence to reopen its borders to tourists on March 25, with no 
requirement to be vaccinated or quarantine but the proviso of a negative PCR test taken in the 72 hours pre-arrival.
The policy applies to visitors from anywhere in the world apart from those coming from South Africa, Brazil, India, 
Pakistan and Bangladesh. While arrivals dropped by 70 per cent last year, there are signs that this one will be much 
better, with new air routes to the islands including an Aeroflot flight from Moscow that began in early April.
The Maldives With its island resorts naturally suited to social distancing, and with tourism directly and indirectly 
accounting for two-thirds of GDP, the Maldives opened its borders to all visitors in July, subject to a negative test. 
Some resorts reported a bumper winter season - Soneva Fushi and its sister property, Soneva Jani, saw occupancy 
up 16 per cent in November against the same month in 2019 - and in April the country announced fully vaccinated 
tourists would be able to enter without testing. Tourism officials now hope to attract 1.5m visitors this year, 
compared to 1.9m in 2019.
A higher proportion of the population (54 per cent) than in the UK or US have had at least one jab, and in April, 
tourism minister Abdulla Mausoom said that among frontline tourism workers the figure was approaching 90 per 
cent. Once all locals are vaccinated, the country will roll out its "3V" tourism strategy: "Visit, Vaccinate, Vacation", 
with visitors offered free jabs on arrival.
Confidence in the tourism recovery seems high: Ritz-Carlton, for example, is pressing ahead with the opening of a 
new 100-villa resort in the Fari islands on June 1, the brand's first hotel in the Maldives. The US-based Capella 
hotel group will open the flagship property in its new Patina brand on the same archipelago on May 18.

Greek islands Greece, where a fifth of jobs and GDP depend on tourism, is currently one of the most open 
countries in Europe - with EU residents, as well as those from the UK, US, Israel, Serbia and the UAE already 
allowed to travel provided they have proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before arrival or that 
they have been fully vaccinated. Tourists from the rest of the world are due to be allowed to enter from May 15.
In March, tourism minister Harry Theoharis announced that, as soon as the most vulnerable group had been 
vaccinated, the country would be prioritising those working in tourism. Authorities have also been targeting their 
vaccination programme, dubbed Operation Freedom, at tourism-dependent islands, using army planes, helicopters 
and coastguard boats to manage the complex task of delivering jabs. Vaccinations on islands with fewer than 1,000 
residents were due to be completed by the end of April, with the effort then accelerating to larger islands. The plans 
seem to have won the confidence of airlines: Ryanair is launching services from UK airports to Kos, Santorini and 
Corfu; Delta is due to restart flights to Athens from New York on May 28 and launch a direct route from its main 
hub, Atlanta, at the start of July. "We are more than optimistic, we are ready," Theoharis told a recent travel 
conference. Israel's early vaccine rollout means it currently has a higher proportion of fully vaccinated people than 
any other country besides the Seychelles, at 56 per cent (the EU, by way of comparison, is on 8 per cent, the US on 
29 per cent). Tourism minister Orit Farkash-Hacohen held a press conference last week announcing plans to 
capitalise on its vaccine advantage. "We cannot miss this opportunity - and as minister of tourism I won't," said

Farkash-Hacohen. The US, UK and UAE will be key targets, with digital billboard advertisements soon to go up in 
Times Square, Piccadilly Circus and Dubai (tagline: "2020 Holy Moses, 2021 Holy Land") as part of a global 
campaign. The government will also offer incentives to airlines to fly into Eilat, and will promote a series of large 
international events, including the Pride Parade in Tel Aviv, a music festival in Timna Park and a joint Israel-UAE 
cycling race.
The timeline for reopening is relatively cautious, with the first small groups of vaccinated travellers arriving on May 
23, and vaccinated independent travellers only allowed to follow in July. American Airlines is due to start flights from 
New York and Miami in May, and in early April Etihad inaugurated the first ever service from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv. 
More generally, Israel's travel hotspots have never seemed more ready - from the increasingly cool ancient city of 
Jaffa to the vast and wild Negev desert, where the smart Six Senses Shaharut is finally due to open in August. 
Malta A 2018 stint as European Capital of Culture and a series of flashy architecture projects, including the 
upcoming
MICAS art museum, have brought some much-needed buzz to the evocative capital, Valletta, and raised Malta's 
tourism profile. The Mediterranean island has also been handy with its vaccination programme, with a higher 
proportion of fully vaccinated citizens than any other European country bar the microstates of Monaco and San 
Marino.
Earlier this month health minister Chris Fearne said the accelerating programme meant the country would reach 
herd immunity by June rather than September as previously thought. Borders are already open to tourists from 50 
countries worldwide, subject to a negative test, and from June fully vaccinated visitors from those countries will be 
free to enter without a test.
Eager to get a head start on the competition, the Maltese authorities are also offering to pay visitors who come for 
at least three nights this summer. According to plans laid out by tourism minister Clayton Bartolo, anyone booking a

Ryanair to sell 737NGs in the coming year
Ryanair to sell 737NGs in the coming year

Ryanair Group is looking to phase out 10 to 12 737-800s per year as it starts to incorporate 60 737 Max units 
between late May and summer 2022.
The European airline group will look to take out its leased fleets, including its fleet of 29 Airbus A320 aircraft starting 
in winter 2022, and "opportunistically sell" other aircraft in batches of five to 10 aircraft, chief financial officer Neil 
Sorahan says during an analyst call.
Sorahan notes 737NG prices are "holding up relatively well", adding that there is opportunity for the aircraft as 
cargo conversions replacing the 737-400BCF.
"We're still seeing interest and demand getting access to 15-plus year old NGs for cargo conversion, so we'll be 
interested in disposing some of those aircraft over the next couple of years," adds Sorahan.
The group increased its firm order to 210 from 135 737 Max units in December last year.
Ryanair also says it sold seven 737NGs in FY2021, completing a (EURO)170 million, 10 aircraft mandate signed in 
2019.
Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker shows the airline group still owns 57 737NGs 15 years and older.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will base two aircraft in Riga from October 2021, resulting in 16 new international routes 
across Europe for the Latvian capital. In total, Ryanair will plough USD200 million into the base which will operate 
30 routes from Riga representing 95 departures per week. It will create 60 direct jobs while contributing to the 
economic recovery of the region, the airline said in a statement. 
The new services will be a significant boost to Ryanair's capacity at Riga, which currently sits at 3.66% out of the 
current 20,868 weekly passenger seats at the airport, according to the ch-aviation capacities module. The Irish low-
cost carrier will be competing with airBaltic (BT, Riga) on at least eight of the new routes, namely Budapest, 
Frankfurt, Gothenburg, Lviv, Paris, Rome, Venice, and Warsaw, according to the ch-aviation schedules module. 
The Latvian carrier holds the lion share of more than 81.3% of the total weekly seat capacity at Riga, the ch-aviation 
capacities shows. "This is a significant announcement for the Ryanair Group and a great boost for Buzz (RR, 
Warsaw Modlin) in Latvia with the creation of these 60 jobs," commented Ryanair's Commercial Director, Jason 
McGuinness. He said the airline had worked closely with Riga airport to secure this growth. "At a time when other 
airlines are reducing their workforce, we're delighted to be making further investments in both our people and in 
airports throughout Europe and look forward to commencing the recruitment for these roles very soon," he said.

Eurowings eyes more bases outside DACH countries

Gearing up for pan-European expansion, Eurowings (EW, Düsseldorf Int'l) is in talks with numerous airports and 
local authorities over plans for several potential bases outside of its core German-speaking markets, Chief 
Executive Jens Bischof said during a CAPA webinar. "We have been able to identify [potential bases] in the 
Nordics, but also in Eastern Europe and South-Eastern Europe... We are already in very specific and very well-
developed talks with airports, communities, of course, governments. We will [launch the bases] over the next, let's 
say, three to nine months, depending a little bit on how fast we will recover from COVID-19," he said. 
While he did not identify any specific airports, he clarified that Eurowings hoped to transform into a pan-European 
low-cost carrier operating services beyond Germany. The Lufthansa Group's LCC already has bases outside its 
home market at Salzburg in Austria, Palma de Mallorca, and Pristina in Kosovo. "I believe the current situation, the 
pandemic, will open up new opportunities... The presence of the Eurowings brand is not where it should be from my 
point of view. So, also in that regard, we're going to develop the brand much further," Bischof added. He claimed 
that Eurowings has "quite successfully" defended the German market from rivals such as Ryanair, easyJet, and 
Wizz Air. Bischof stressed that the country would remain the carrier's most important market for the time to come, 
despite the growth plans. It will continue to focus on secondary airports rather than Frankfurt Int'l and Munich, which 
are better served by full-service parent Lufthansa. Bischof stressed that Eurowings would not be competing with 
start-up sister carrier EW Discover, which will operate long-haul leisure flights from the group's main hubs. "It is 
clearly a separate playing field, with us being in [secondary cities in] Germany, and also elsewhere in Europe, 
focusing on short- and medium-haul, whereas EW Discover is focusing on leisure and long-haul out of Frankfurt 
and Munich... And even if there are some [overlapping] routes which may be from Frankfurt and Munich, that 
wouldn't bother us. If we fly, for example, from Mallorca to Munich, and EW Discover does it the other way around, 
we just have a nice compliment of the schedule. But of course, there are no plans whatsoever to develop EW 
Discover outside of Frankfurt and Munich," Bischof explained. Eurowings will continue to operate a mix of business 
and leisure routes. However, Bischof underlined that in the near term, the leisure market would be the core focus 
due to its expected quicker post-COVID recovery.

Ryanair 's price checker tool causes more disruption for online travel agencies
Ryanair's price checker tool causes more disruption for online travel 
agencies

Highlight: Ryanair's recent introduction of its price checker tool has fired another warning shot at online travel 
agencies (OTAs) selling its fares. Customers can now check the price paid by the OTA for their flight directly on 
Ryanair, allowing them to check for hidden fees or price differentials. With many high-profile agencies facing an 
onslaught of criticism from customers and industry bodies during the pandemic, it is yet another blow to OTA's who 
are trying to rebuild their reputations.
Body
OTAs have tough decisions to make regarding the use of RyanairThe complexity in the current travel market is 
multi-layered, with customers hypersensitive to booking complications, security and cost. Any potential negative PR 
or customer experience is heightened and is problematic for any agency's recovery. According to GlobalData's 
Global Covid-19 recovery survey*, 84% of customers were either 'always,' 'often' or 'somewhat' influenced by the 
reliability of a product or service, highlighting the pressure OTAs face. 
Cost, financial security and transparency are crucial to the success of those agencies lucky enough to survive the 
pandemic. Unfortunately, many online agencies that use 'screen scrapers' (software that is used to pull content and 
from other websites so they can sell its products) could face negative backlash from customers, lengthening 
recovery timelines. Moving forwards, OTAs are going to have to make it clear what they are charging customers. A 
potential solution could be the introduction of a flat booking fee for some low-cost carriers. Many corporate travel 
agencies adopt a similar approach, ensuring service fees are made clear to the customer or business account prior 
to booking. These agencies are permitted to book Ryanair through a Global Distribution System (GDS) such as 
Travelport or Sabre, which is a different method to OTAs. The alternative is that OTAs either continue to trade as 
usual and attempt to weather the customer backlash, risking further negative media exposure. Another option is to 
boycott Ryanair altogether. However, with Ryanair operating so many routes within Europe, it could be damaging to 
OTAs, with many selling high volumes of Ryanair flights with their package holidays. Agencies such as On the 
Beach and LoveHolidays need to take careful consideration as they are already in a PR whirlwind due to delayed 
refund payments and their decision to leave ABTA. Ryanair stands to gain an advantage in the long termA 
significant portion of Ryanair's revenue comes from direct bookings on its website via flight content, ancillary 
Ryanair 's price checker tool causes more disruption for online travel agencies
services, hotels and car hire. Ultimately, Ryanair wants to drive traffic away from online travel agencies and to its 
own website. This is much more efficient for Ryanair, helping it to maximise revenue and dealing with changes, 
cancellations and refunds more effectively. Low-cost carriers are no strangers to taking companies (or each other) 
to court. The use of words used on Ryanair's website such as 'unauthorised', 'fake' and 'overcharging,' are 
dangerous accusations to throw around. However, Ryanair has a business model to protect and in a sensitive 
climate, it may be essential for the airline's long-term survival. *GlobalData Global Recovery survey week 11

Apr 30, 2021( The Antiplanner: http://ti.org/antiplanner Delivered by Newstex)  Rail advocates like to claim that the 
introduction of high-speed trains has led to a cessation of airline service, apparently to show that high-speed trains 
can compete against faster planes. While this may have happened on a few routes, European air travel before the 
pandemic was growing far faster than rail travel. For example, in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain — the main 
European countries with high-speed rail — rail travel[1] between 2011 and 2019 grew by 14 percent while air 
travel[2] grew by 34 percent. 
No European country saw rail travel grow faster than air travel. The government of France has found a solution to 
for-profit airlines outcompeting government-subsidized trains: ban the competing air travel. Under a law passed 
earlier this month[3], airlines will not be allowed to operate on routes that trains can serve in less than two-and-a-
half hours. If high-speed trains were able to compete on their own, they wouldn't need such a law. Of course, 
French politicians justified this law based on the supposed savings in carbon emissions. But conventional trains are 
only a little more energy efficient than planes, and high-speed trains require well over 50 percent more energy, per 
train-car-mile, than conventional trains. Passenger occupancies also tend to be much higher on planes than trains 
— typically 85 percent vs. 50 percent — because planes usually operate in non-stop service while trains make 
many stops, so the size of planes can be set to demand while trains must be sized to fit the portion of the journey 
where demand is highest.  France gets most of its electricity from nuclear power, so electric-powered transportation 
won't emit much greenhouse gases. However, constructing high-speed rail lines can produce tens of thousands of 
tons of greenhouse gases per mile, while planes require very little infrastructure. The net result is that it isn't clear 
whether high-speed trains are cleaner than flying. Ironically, the same bill that limited short-haul flights gave Air 
France-KLM (which is 18 percent owned by the government) €4 billion to help it cope with the pandemic. Air France 
mainly though not exclusively does long-haul flights, and even before the pandemic it had decided to reduce[4] its 
short-haul flights. Meanwhile, the airlines that do short-haul flights that will be most affected by France's pro-train 
law are low-cost carriers such as Ryanair[5] and easyJet[6]. These airlines — most of which are not French-owned 
— also compete against Air France on some long-haul routes. So the new law simultaneously reduces competition 
for France's government-owned high-speed trains as well as hurts competition to the partly government-owned flag 
carrier. Somehow I don't think this is really about greenhouse gases.https://www.addtoany.com/share [ 1]:

 The UK's High Court ordered Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) to compensate passengers whose flights were canceled 
in 2018 due to industrial action by pilots and cabin, BBC News reported Thursday.
The budget airline was claiming that it did not have to make the payments as the cancellations were caused by 
"extraordinary circumstances."
The Civil Aviation Authority took the company to court after it refused to comply with European Union legislation, 
which grants passengers a claim for delayed and canceled flights.
Ryanair's stock was up marginally on Thursday's close.

Two steps forward, one step Max
Boeing’s rehabilitation of its troubled narrowbody is gathering pace, but the process has not been without setbacks
After a traumatic two years for Boeing and its 737 Max programme, some of the airframer’s top customers have 
signed up for hundreds more of the narrowbodies, delivering key endorsements as the type returns to service.
Notably, Southwest Airlines’ decision, disclosed on 29 March, to replace 737-700s with 100 737 Max 7s came after 
follow-on Max orders from key customers Ryanair and United Airlines.
But a further batch of Max order cancellations in March – including Turkish Airlines (50) and lessors CDB Aviation 
(16) and China Aircraft Leasing (26) – again highlights the faltering nature of the recovery for both the jet itself and 
the wider industry.
In all, Boeing took in 196 orders in March, offset by 156 cancellations – the vast majority for the Max.
And in another example of how the 737 Max’s troubles are not yet completely behind it, Boeing in April 
recommended that some a­irlines remove a subset of the twinjet from service pending maintenance related to an 
unspecified ­back­up power control system (see below).
The news came as Boeing attempted to shift the narrative away from the jet’s earlier woes, caused by a pair of fatal 
crashes.
Gol followers
A string of airlines have now returned the Max to service, following Brazilian carrier Gol, which in December 2020 
became the first operator to restore commercial flights with the type.
Globally, about 170 Max are back in the skies, with airlines holding another roughly 300 in storage, Cirium data 
shows.
No Headline In Original
While operators in North and Latin America have led the charge, Euro­pean carriers too are returning the Max to 
service, after regulators there, in late January, cleared the type. TUI Airlines became the first European carrier to 
restore Max service, in February, followed in March by Icelandair, Czech carrier Smartwings and LOT Polish 
Airlines.
Romanian budget carrier Blue Air, meanwhile, became a new Max customer at the start of April after taking delivery 
of the first of 10 of the type from Air Lease.
Ryanair too will shortly become a new Max operator in Europe, having been on the verge of taking its first Max 
when the aircraft was grounded in March 2019.
The Irish carrier expects to operate 16 737 Max 8-200s – a high-density variant of the Max 8 – by the peak summer 
travel season. That goal moved closer when the European regulator in early April approved the variant.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary has been a vocal proponent of the narrowbody: in December, shortly after 
the US Federal Aviation Administration lifted the grounding, Ryanair firmed orders for 75 Max, bringing its total 
commitment to 210.
Boeing may have secured the Max’s place with Ryanair, but the troubled state of the wider airline sector has raised 
uncertainty about its future with other European carriers.
Chief among those is Norwegian which, prior to the grounding, operated 18 of the jets – more than any other 
European airline. But Norwegian has since embarked on a ­major restructuring, ditching long-haul operations. It 
does not plan to use Max aircraft as part of its initial operational ramp-up and has not commented on plans beyond 
the summer.
Last year, the carrier said it was cancelling 92 Max orders. Boeing has not actually removed those from its books 
but has shifted an undisclosed number into a ­special accounting bucket – known as ASC-606 – that is reserved for 
sales over which there is significant uncertainty.
Neither has there been apparent movement by two European customers to firm Max order commitments made 
during the grounding. Those orders include Air Astana’s deal to acquire 30 Max for its low-cost unit, FlyArystan, and 
IAG’s headline-stealing letter of intent, revealed during the 2019 Paris air show, to buy 200 Max.
Recovery has also been slower in the Asia-Pacific region, home to more than 20 Max operators before the 
grounding.
In late February, Australia became the first country in the region to lift the Max’s grounding. Days later, New 
Zealand followed suit, though it stopped short of a blanket approval.
Next steps
While no Australian carrier currently operates 737 Max, two foreign carriers – Singapore Airlines (SIA) unit SilkAir 
and Fiji Airways – had previously flown the type into the country. Fiji lifted its grounding in early April.
Though Singapore authorities have not cleared the Max for commercial flights, SIA is preparing for the type’s return. 
The carrier – which has been integrating regional unit SilkAir into its mainline operation – in March began shuttling 
its six 737 Max back home from storage in Australia, as a cabin retro­fit programme gets under way for the type.
Crucially, the Max remains grounded in China, which was the first country to ban flights of the narrowbody. China’s 
civil aviation regulator has said that it has been discussing with Boeing a plan to restore 737 Max services, but has 
not presented a timeline for any such move.
China is a huge market for the single-aisle: at the time of the Max grounding, 12 Chinese operators had nearly 100 
of the jets in service, with another 200 orders, Cirium data shows.
No Headline In Original
Aside from China, two other notable hold-outs in Asia are India and Indonesia, although the former has now 
permitted overflights with the type. Globally, more than 160 out of 195 civil aviation regulators have opened their 
airspace to the Max, Boeing says.

Alitalia (AZ, Rome Fiumicino) faces a "tragic" situation as it cannot pay salaries to its employees for April until 
emergency aid is provided, the chief executive of the troubled airline's successor ITA - Italia Trasporto Aereo (AZ, 
Rome Fiumicino), Fabio Lazzerini, told a meeting of the transport and industry committees in the Chamber of 
Deputies, the lower house of Italy's parliament, on April 27. Its state-owned successor ITA has been scheduled to 
replace Alitalia by July 1. Still, lengthy negotiations with the European Commission have delayed the launch and 
risk destroying the project altogether if the summer season opportunities are missed, Lazzerini warned. Last week, 
the government was due to approve a further advance of EUR50 million euros (USD60 million) to Alitalia as part of 
an ongoing list of bailouts for revenues lost during the coronavirus pandemic, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. 
Still, the government did not transfer the funds in time for workers to be paid on schedule on April 27. "The 
employees are not getting their salaries on time, and this is a tragic situation," Lazzerini said at the meeting. 
The negotiations between Rome and Brussels on how to allow ITA to proceed while complying with European 
Union antitrust laws are proving tough, reports said, with the commission demanding a clear discontinuity with the 
past, including shedding many of the flag carrier's slots at Milan Linate Airport. ITA is "holding out" in the talks in 
trying to convince Brussels it needs to retain ownership of Alitalia's ground handling and maintenance businesses, 
Lazzerini told the committees. "We need to start quickly because the market is picking up, and Alitalia's rivals are 
acting aggressively, especially the low-cost carriers," Lazzerini said, referring to a Ryanair plan, announced in 
March, to offer 100 routes in Italy during the summer. "We aim to start flying on July 1 with a small number of 
aircraft that will gradually grow over time," Lazzerini pleaded, putting the number at 47 passenger aircraft and two 
or three for cargo transport, according to the newspaper Corriere della Sera. Besides its talks with the European 
Commission, ITA has also been negotiating with Lufthansa on one side and Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines, and 
Virgin Atlantic on the other about a possible alliance partnership "that is not only European but also transatlantic," 
Lazzerini added. The idea is to firstly start with commercial partnerships and later to try to bring foreign carriers into 
the shareholding of ITA. A decision on an international partner is expected by the end of June, he said.

Airlines and other travel stocks attracted more buyers than sellers this morning as the European Union said it would 
allow visits from vaccinated travellers.  
The European Commission confirmed that the EU's members will unconditionally accept any holidaymakers or 
business travellers if they have received coronavirus vaccines that have been approved by the European Medicines 
Agency.
Over 12 months ago the bloc shut down almost all non-essential travel from most countries, including the US.
UK regulations are set to allow people to travel abroad for holidays from 17 May under a proposed 'traffic light' 
system that will impose harsher restrictions on countries with higher rates of infection.
Anyone returning from abroad will still need to be tested and may be required to quarantine.
The government has not yet confirmed when unrestricted overseas travel will return.
The EU decision "does highlight a gradual willingness to wake international air travel from its drawn-out slumber," 
said market analyst Josh Mahony at IG. "Unfortunately, India Unfortunately, India highlights the risks involved when 
vaccination levels are low, with daily cases rising from 47k to 321k in the space of a month.
"Until vaccinations build a strong base layer of protection, countries will have to continue the fine balancing act that 
involves knowing greater economic freedom will often come with higher risk of widespread infections."
Airlines and tour operators given EU travel boost
In other travel news, Hong Kong and Singapore also announced a much-awaited travel bubble starting from 26 May 
and following a similar move between New Zealand and Australia last week.
Shares in tour operator TUI AG (LON:TUI) and British Airways owner IAG (LON:IAG) were up 4% on Monday 
morning, while Easyjet PLC (LON:EZJ) climbed 3.5%, Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) was up 2.5% and Wizz Air

Europe's largest banks are planning to cut business travel permanently by as much as half from pre-pandemic 
levels after the coronavirus crisis recedes, as many of the new ways of remote working trialled during lockdown 
become the norm.
Senior bankers are keen to learn from the lessons of the past year to cut costs and bolster their green credentials, 
but the plans will be worrying for airlines and hospitality groups that rely heavily on business travel for profits and 
who are hoping for a swift recovery once restrictions are lifted.
Noel Quinn, chief executive of HSBC, told the Financial Times he expected personally to reduce his travel by about 
half post-Covid. Britain's Lloyds Banking
Group and Dutch bank ABN Amro, meanwhile, have become two of the first big lenders to set formal bankwide 
emissions targets. Lloyds pledged to "sustain the momentum" built during the pandemic by keeping carbondioxide 
emissions from travel to less than 50 per cent of 2019 levels.
ABN is aiming to halve its air travel compared with 2017 over the next five years in part by making bankers take 
trains, rather than flying between its European offices.
European banks' plan to slash business travel bodes ill for airline recovery hopes
For the airlines and hospitality groups, it could prove a savage blow. Business class is one of the most lucrative 
sources of income for some airlines, while international hotels and other hospitality groups, such as restaurants and 
bars, can make up a lot of their earnings from executive functions.
It also undermines predictions from some industry bosses, such as Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary, who 
last week forecast business travel will make a full recovery from the crisis.
For domestic banks, such as Lloyds, cutting back on travel may be relatively easier, although it will still require a 
reduction in face-to-face meetings with business customers and foreign investors. However, even internationally 
focused investment banks are planning substantial cuts. A senior executive at another bank with operations across 
several countries said his company had yet to settle on a final target, but it was also considering limiting travel "to 
half of pre-pandemic practice".
Several senior bankers said they were keen to resume some types of travel such as visiting staff and clients, but 
that 2020 had proved that many trips taken in the past were superfluous.

T his week, I asked my Instagram followers to describe how they feel about pensions in a single word.
The answers ranged from "lucky" (a friend in her 60s grateful for the security of her final salary pension) to "yikes!" 
(a self-employed pal, aged 30, who has no pension at all).
"Confused" was the top answer ("lost" and "uninformed" featured). Yet those of us who had engaged with pension 
saving a bit more did not feel much better, choosing "exasperated", "opaque" and "joyless" to describe our 
experiences.
My own choice of word was "argh". I had a letter from my pensions provider last month about tax thresholds that 
was so full of jargon and long-winded caveats, it may as well have been written in Sanskrit.
While pensions are clearly something most of us find very complex, pension providers are ultra wary of giving 
anything that could be construed as "advice" when they attempt to communicate with us.
Why? Financial advice is a strictly regulated activity. If you need help deciphering all the jargon and tax rules, you'll 
have to pay a financial adviser - and they are not cheap (evidenced by the friend who wrote "fleeced").
Even so, as a well paid professional, at least he's been able to access advice and make significant pension 
savings. Many working people cannot afford to do either.
This explains why the UK's "advice gap" is huge - only 9 per cent of UK adults ever see a financial adviser.
In a word, tell me how you feel about pensions
The death of generous final salary schemes means that for most of us, managing our own pensions and 
investments is something we will need to do throughout our working lives and well into retirement.
Leaving your money invested in the stock market after you have retired is now the norm - exposing individuals to far 
greater levels of risk. When you consider that most people feel themselves ill-equipped to deal with this, it's a 
looming disaster.
Yet it is a problem that US asset management giant Vanguard sees as a huge opportunity. This week, it started a 
price war by launching a fully advised pension service for less than half the amount typically charged by other UK 
advisory firms.
A bit like the Ryanair of the investment world, Vanguard is a low cost, no frills proposition (although I suspect its 
customer service ratings are somewhat higher than the airline).
The target audience are people like me in their 40s, in the midst of what advisers call the "accumulation phase", 
where we are saving up as much as we can towards retirement. Vanguard wants to make this as simple as possible 
and there are lessons we can all take from this approach.
Customers must have at least £50,000 to invest and start by completing a digital fact-find. The most difficult 
questions are probably "when do you want to retire?" and "how much income do you want in retirement?"
You'll need to have a stab at those in order to be given a savings target to aim at, and a cash flow visualisation 
showing how the money flowing in to be invested now could grow over time and hopefully flow out as income after 
you retire.
James Norton, who leads Vanguard's financial planning team, says this helps address the question he believes is 
behind most of the confusion and worry associated with pension savings - "Will I have enough money to last me?"
Another important question is whether customers are saving the maximum amount into their workplace pension to 
bag the "free money" of matched contributions. If you don't know the answer, put it at the top of your to-do list now.
They will also be probed about unused tax allowances. If you earn a six-figure salary and you've never heard of 
carry forward, add that to your list as well.
It's not just the fees that will be a game changer. Most people will rely on a combination of pensions and stocks and 
shares Isas in retirement. Vanguard offers both, and will allocate your cash accordingly in the most tax-efficient 
manner, eliminating yet more complexity.
Nevertheless, there are some important caveats. The fees are so cheap because it's restricted advice (you can only 
invest in Vanguard's own range of passive funds) and for now at least, it does not cover the "decumulation" phase - 
managing your investments during retirement, the point at which many people seek financial advice.
I'm eager to see how consumers respond to this approach and what effect this has on the rest of the market. 
Anything that helps to make pension saving clearer, less daunting and easier to engage with will be a bonus.
All too often, it feels like the pensions world does not want to engage with us. But to get the best bang for our buck, 
we also need to ask more questions and be more demanding of our providers.
A year ago, I would have been more inclined to believe the argument that many young people were uninterested in 
pensions. However, the surging numbers who have started investing during the pandemic has changed my mind.
Sadly, I've not yet seen any memes proclaim "I've upped my contributions into my company pension" or "tax relief 
has boosted my investment pot by 40 per cent". Yet in the long term, both of these could easily eclipse short-term 
gains from trading shares in GameStop.
In a word, tell me how you feel about pensions
Next week, the FT is running a series of free online events giving younger readers the chance to tell us how they 
feel about areas of the financial world where the odds seem stacked against them.
Pensions are one. The housing market is another (indeed, many have eschewed pension saving to prioritise getting 
a housing deposit together).
So if you're feeling confused, frustrated or even angry, I would urge you to sign up for the session next Tuesday 
lunchtime with me, Josephine Cumbo, the FT's global pensions correspondent, and Sebastian Payne, Whitehall 
editor and host of the Payne's Politics podcast - and a millennial who admits to needing help with his pension.
Whatever word you'd use to describe them, the dreadful jargon and complexity makes pensions an area of personal 
finance that's easy to ignore. But when you stop to think about what's at stake, it's hard to overstate the danger of 
putting it off for another day.
Sign up for the FT's free NextGen series of digital events next week including "Pensions: A decent retirement for 
the young" via www.newdeal.live.ft.com Claer Barrett is the FT's consumer editor claer.barrett@ft.com; Twitter

All too often, it feels like the pensions world does not want to engage with us. But to get the best bang for our buck, 
we also need to ask more questions and be more demanding of our providers.
A year ago, I would have been more inclined to believe the argument that many young people were uninterested in 
pensions. However, the surging numbers who have started investing during the pandemic has changed my mind.
Sadly, I've not yet seen any memes proclaim "I've upped my contributions into my company pension" or "tax relief 
has boosted my investment pot by 40 per cent". Yet in the long term, both of these could easily eclipse short-term 
gains from trading shares in GameStop.
In a word, tell me how you feel about pensions
Next week, the FT is running a series of free online events giving younger readers the chance to tell us how they 
feel about areas of the financial world where the odds seem stacked against them.
Pensions are one. The housing market is another (indeed, many have eschewed pension saving to prioritise getting 
a housing deposit together).
So if you're feeling confused, frustrated or even angry, I would urge you to sign up for the session next Tuesday 
lunchtime with me, Josephine Cumbo, the FT's global pensions correspondent, and Sebastian Payne, Whitehall 
editor and host of the Payne's Politics podcast - and a millennial who admits to needing help with his pension.
Whatever word you'd use to describe them, the dreadful jargon and complexity makes pensions an area of personal 
finance that's easy to ignore. But when you stop to think about what's at stake, it's hard to overstate the danger of 
putting it off for another day.

T his week, I asked my Instagram followers to describe how they feel about pensions in a single word.
The answers ranged from "lucky" (a friend in her 60s grateful for the security of her final salary pension) to "yikes!" 
(a self-employed pal, aged 30, who has no pension at all).
"Confused" was the top answer ("lost" and "uninformed" featured). Yet those of us who had engaged with pension 
saving a bit more did not feel much better, choosing "exasperated", "opaque" and "joyless" to describe our 
experiences.
My own choice of word was "argh". I had a letter from my pensions provider last month about tax thresholds that 
was so full of jargon and long-winded caveats, it may as well have been written in Sanskrit.
While pensions are clearly something most of us find very complex, pension providers are ultra wary of giving 
anything that could be construed as "advice" when they attempt to communicate with us.
Why? Financial advice is a strictly regulated activity. If you need help deciphering all the jargon and tax rules, you'll 
have to pay a financial adviser - and they are not cheap (evidenced by the friend who wrote "fleeced").
Even so, as a well paid professional, at least he's been able to access advice and make significant pension 
savings. Many working people cannot afford to do either.
This explains why the UK's "advice gap" is huge - only 9 per cent of UK adults ever see a financial adviser.
In a word, tell me how you feel about pensions
The death of generous final salary schemes means that for most of us, managing our own pensions and 
investments is something we will need to do throughout our working lives and well into retirement.
Leaving your money invested in the stock market after you have retired is now the norm - exposing individuals to far 
greater levels of risk. When you consider that most people feel themselves ill-equipped to deal with this, it's a 
looming disaster.
Yet it is a problem that US asset management giant Vanguard sees as a huge opportunity. This week, it started a 
price war by launching a fully advised pension service for less than half the amount typically charged by other UK 
advisory firms.
A bit like the Ryanair of the investment world, Vanguard is a low cost, no frills proposition (although I suspect its 
customer service ratings are somewhat higher than the airline).
The target audience are people like me in their 40s, in the midst of what advisers call the "accumulation phase", 
where we are saving up as much as we can towards retirement. Vanguard wants to make this as simple as possible 
and there are lessons we can all take from this approach.
Customers must have at least £50,000 to invest and start by completing a digital fact-find. The most difficult 
questions are probably "when do you want to retire?" and "how much income do you want in retirement?"
You'll need to have a stab at those in order to be given a savings target to aim at, and a cash flow visualisation 
showing how the money flowing in to be invested now could grow over time and hopefully flow out as income after 
you retire.
James Norton, who leads Vanguard's financial planning team, says this helps address the question he believes is 
behind most of the confusion and worry associated with pension savings - "Will I have enough money to last me?"
Another important question is whether customers are saving the maximum amount into their workplace pension to 
bag the "free money" of matched contributions. If you don't know the answer, put it at the top of your to-do list now.
They will also be probed about unused tax allowances. If you earn a six-figure salary and you've never heard of 
carry forward, add that to your list as well.
It's not just the fees that will be a game changer. Most people will rely on a combination of pensions and stocks and 
shares Isas in retirement. Vanguard offers both, and will allocate your cash accordingly in the most tax-efficient 
manner, eliminating yet more complexity.
Nevertheless, there are some important caveats. The fees are so cheap because it's restricted advice (you can only 
invest in Vanguard's own range of passive funds) and for now at least, it does not cover the "decumulation" phase - 
managing your investments during retirement, the point at which many people seek financial advice.
I'm eager to see how consumers respond to this approach and what effect this has on the rest of the market.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) has a "compelling" summer 2022 outlook, according to Credit Suisse, but there 
are factors to consider over the coming months before greater clarity emerges.
The Swiss bank reckons capacity in 2022 will be 14% lower than 2019, while the following year it will rise 7%.
READ: Ryanair update dashes City hopes of quick airline recovery
Forecasts continue evolving due to the fluidity of airline capacity planning and a greater urgency among airlines to 
retire older widebodies while taking more time on the narrowbody side.
Moreover, the aircraft leasing market seems to have paused somewhat to await an international traffic recovery 
which would enable easier marketing of unwanted or unaffordable aircraft from Europe into markets such as Asia.
Analysts think that with short-haul leisure demand potentially fully rebounding in summer 2022, a capacity outlook 
14% below summer 2019 would surely see a range of airlines change decisions or scramble to source additional 
capacity to participate as much as possible.
On Wednesday, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary reiterated expectations for a near-breakeven 
performance in the year to March 2022.
In an interview with the Financial Times, he predicted a "seismic" 20-25% capacity reduction in the European short-
haul market beyond the pandemic, which, together with much lower unit cots, would be likely to drive a strong profit 
recovery in 2023.

Credit Suisse holds an 'outperform' stance on the stock with target price of (EURO)17.91.
Shares rose 3% to (EURO)15.75 on Thursday late morning.

Wizz Air remains favoured as JPMorgan slashes airline company forecasts
Wizz Air remains favoured as JPMorgan slashes airline company forecasts

Wizz Air PLC (LON:WIZZ) is the only low-cost airline that JPMorgan remains even remotely keen on after a review 
of the European players.
The broker has made meaningful cuts to its current year forecasts for Wizz Air, Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) 
and easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ), reflecting the ongoing travel restrictions across Europe and higher fuel and carbon 
costs.
Cuts to its forecasts for next year are more modest, thanks to the roll-out of vaccinations across continental Europe, 
where the pace has picked up in the last three weeks.
The broker thinks all three carriers will be back in profit in 2022.
JPMorgan (JPM) describes its "overweight" recommendation on Wizz Air as "contrarian" as eight other brokers who 
cover the stock rate it as a "sell".
"This surprises us for many reasons. (1) WIZZ has a solid balance sheet with good liquidity. (2) It undoubtedly has 
the best multi-year growth story in the sector. (3) With an ultra-low cost base, we expect WIZZ to return to the upper 
end of its target net income margin (13% to 15%) in the next few years. (4) Trading liquidity has improved following 
the recent Indigo placing; the free float is now c61% of the fully diluted share count and c91% of the ordinary 
shares," JPM said.
In contrast, easyJet has only two "sell" ratings among the analyst community while Ryanair has only one; JPM is 
neutral on both.
Wizz Air remains favoured as JPMorgan slashes airline company forecasts
For easyJet, JPM is forecasting a pre-tax loss of £1.31bn for the year to the end of September, having previously 
forecast a loss of £914mln.
EasyJet is the most geared of the three low-cost carriers to the likely re-opening of European travel later this 
summer, JPM asserts.
Despite the slashing of the profit forecast, its easyJet price target, based on earnings multiples enjoyed by its peers, 
rises to 845p from 710p.
Ryanair is now expected to post a net loss of (EURO)138mln in the year to the end of March 2002, compared to 
JPM's previous forecast of a profit of (EURO)146mln.
"On Jan 19th this year we moved RYA from OW [overweight] to Neutral, arguing that RYA's restrictions on 
shareholders (post the end of the Brexit transition on Dec 31st 2020) were too severe and would limit demand for 
the shares, especially from UK investors," JPM said.
"We believe these restrictions, at least in part, explain RYA's underperformance in 2021 YTD [year-to-date]. 
Moreover, in the next 12 months at least, we are sceptical that the EU will change its policy and allow UK investors 
to be treated as 'Qualifying Nationals' for the purpose of owning shares in European airlines. We believe the 
ongoing restrictions RYA has imposed on its shares will continue to be a headwind to their performance," 
JPMorgan said.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) expects a very strong recovery in its profit in fiscal 2022 following lower expenses and 
the resumption of traveling after the COVID-19 pandemic, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary.
The budget airline expects financial results for the year ending March 2022 to be at a break-even level but record a 
small profit if it manages to fly more than 100 million passengers. On the other hand, it expects to generate a strong 
profit in fiscal 2023, O'Leary added.
Ryanair's shares declined almost 1% on Wednesday's close.

https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/airlines-across-the-globe-count-the-7bn-cost-of-covid/A slower than anticipated 
global vaccine rollout and wider failure to get Covid under control will cost airlines $10bn (7.2bn) more than 
previously predicted, according to the organisation that represents global airlines.The warning from the International 
Air Transport Association came as Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned on Wednesday there would be 
'seismic' cut in capacity across the industry due to the pandemic, including up to 25% fewer flights in Europe. 
O'Leary said travel from the UK to the EU would become more expensive and cumbersome as a result of Brexit, 
while leisure travel would not return to normal until 2023. Willie Walsh, the former boss of British Airways' parent 
company IAG and new director general of Iata, railed against the cost of the PCR Covid tests now required for air 
travel, and criticised the government's decision to charge VAT on the products. 
The standard VAT rate of 20% applies to private testing kits. Walsh said: 'I am surprised that consumer groups 
have not been focused on this issue. If we are doing these tests because there is a health crisis, governments 
shouldn't be charging VAT and people should not be profiteering off the back of it. ' The aviation industry is now 
expected to lose around $48bn during 2021, according to new Iata forecasts, more than a quarter higher than the 
$38bn it predicted last December. Iata pointed to the slower vaccine rollout in countries including France and 
Germany, as well as in emerging markets for the higher losses, combined with the rise of new virus variants and 
continued restrictions on international travel restrictions. North American airlines have fared better than those in 
Europe thanks to a domestic recovery. They are forecast to lose $5bn this year rather than $11bn as estimated in 
December. However, European carriers are set to lose $22bn, up from December's estimate of $12bn, and 
following a $35bn loss last year. Iata is also expecting much higher fuel prices, with jet fuel seen at $68.9 a barrel 
and oil at $64.2 a barrel - up from the $49.5 and $45.5 a barrel forecast in December - as the strengthening global 
economy pushes energy prices higher. Cost-cutting by airlines and a return to flying on some domestic routes has 
helped the industry to reduce its forecast losses from the $126bn lost in 2020, although carriers are still not 
predicted to break even until 2022. Airlines have increased their numbers of cargo flights during the pandemic, a 
trend which is expected to continue, however Iata warned this would not cover the collapse in passenger travel, 
meaning airline operating revenues are expected to reach only 55% of 2019 levels during 2021. 'This crisis is 
longer and deeper than anyone could have expected,' Walsh said. 'Losses will be reduced from 2020, but the pain 
of the crisis increases. There is optimism in domestic markets where aviation's hallmark resilience is demonstrated 
Airlines across the globe count the 7bn cost of Covid
by rebounds in markets without internal travel restrictions. Government-imposed travel restrictions, however, 
continue to dampen the strong underlying demand for international travel.' Iata said demand for tickets on domestic 
flights in China and North America showed passengers were keen to return to the skies. Demand for travel within 
China has already surpassed 2019 levels. Despite the continuing travel restrictions, Iata estimates that 2.4 billion 
people will travel by air in 2021. The group said: 'We have not written off 2021, as the vaccination forecasts 
suggests some advanced economy markets should be able to open and we anticipate a strong fourth quarter as a 
result.' Iata expects travel between the UK and the US, which both aim to have fully vaccinated 75% of their adult 
populations by July, to resume earlier than travel to and from continental Europe. Walsh criticised the UK 
government's requirement for PCR testing for travellers before departure and after arrival, calling the fees being 
charged for tests 'clearly outrageous'. He added: 'We've got to challenge the need for PCR[tests], is it the only 
acceptable risk mitigant that can be put in place when there's a significant improvement in the quality and speed 
and price of other tests.' The Treasury is understood to be considering how it can reduce the cost of travel, while 
ensuring it is as safe as possible. This could include cheaper tests being used when holidaymakers return home, 
and the possibility of the government providing pre-departure tests. Read more: Airlines across the globe count the

LCCs awarded seasonal slots at Milan Linate

Several low-cost carriers, including easyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air, have secured slots at Milan Linate airport for 
seasonal leisure services during the summer 2021 season, although thus far, only easyJet has confirmed its 
intention to use them. easyJet said it would operate from the metropolitan airport to Catania and Palermo in Sicily 
given growing optimism of a strong recovery in the domestic leisure market during the upcoming season. The airline 
plans to begin the services on June 11, operating 2x daily on both routes. 
In turn, Ryanair's and Wizz Air's plans seem more opportunistic and less clear. The two LCCs benefitted from 
relaxed slot utilisation rules during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allow operators to return slots they do not intend 
to utilise without permanently losing them. As such, they have secured slots only for several weeks of the current 
season. According to Corriere della Sera, Ryanair has secured slots to operate from Linate to Brussels National 
and Berlin Brandenburg Int'l only in June, September, and October, with a gap in July and August. Wizz Air, in turn, 
is also betting on the leisure market and has secured slots for services to Catania in June, September, and October 
(up to 3x daily) and limited services in August. Neither Ryanair nor Wizz Air confirmed their ambition to launch 
services from Linate. Both currently serve Milan Malpensa and Milan Bergamo in the Milan agglomeration. 
Ryanair's Chief Executive Eddie Wilson explicitly denied plans to serve Linate during a press conference on April 
13, 2021, citing the lack of available slots beyond the current summer season. In a statement to ch-aviation, Wizz 
Air's spokesperson confirmed that the airline secured slots at Linate but refused to speculate on any route 
launches. On top of the pan-European LCCs, Blue Panorama Airlines has secured slots to connect Linate with 
Reggio di Calabria; EGO Airways - to Lampedusa, Pantelleria, Ibiza, and Mykonos; and Lumiwings to Lampedusa. 
Air Dolomiti also obtained slots to fly to Munich, while Austrian Airlines for flights from Vienna and Salzburg. Before 
the pandemic, congested Linate catered predominantly to business and point-to-point traffic. It is the only airport in 
the Milan agglomeration served by Alitalia, which currently has an 82.1% market share by capacity there.

Apr 19, 2021( ValueWalk Premium: https://valuewalkpremium.com Delivered by Newstex)  Brook Asset 
Management was up 7.27% for the first quarter, compared to the MSCI GBT TR Net World Index, which returned 
3.96%. For March, the fund was up 1.1%. Q1 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[1] 
https://valuewalkpremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/invest_1598897412.png In his March letter to investors, 
which was reviewed by ValueWalk, James Hanbury of Brook said returns during the first quarter were driven by 
their long equity book, which contributed 12% but were partially offset by the losses in the short book, which 
detracted 3.84%. Currency hedges added 0.67%. The long book generated alpha of 4.97%, while the short book 
generated 0.67% alpha. The markets were positive on the back of stronger macro data, positive news about COVID 
vaccines and additional fiscal stimulus.Top contributors during Q1The biggest contributor from Brook's long book 
was TCS Group Holding PLC (MCX:TCSG), which added 1.97%. The Russian fintech company's stock rose as 
founder Oleg Tinkoff gave up his super voting rights and handled governance concerns. Investors also started 
including multiples on the company's non-credit businesses, which now account for 37% of its revenues. U.S. 
satellite company ViaSat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) added 1.76% as value stocks came back into favor. Brook's U.K. 
leisure stocks also did well during the first quarter as the country rolled out the vaccine and saw improvements in 
deaths and hospital admissions compared to mainland Europe. National Express Group PLC (OTCMKTS:NXPGF) 
(LON:NEX) contributed 1.31%, while JD Wetherspoon plc (LON:JDW) added 0.7%, and Restaurant Group 
contributed 0.61%. Hanbury said their U.K. leisure stocks balanced with their airline positions, which are more 
focused on international travel. Brook's airline stocks were mixed during the quarter. IAG (LON:AIG) contributed 
0.91%, while EasyJet (OTCMKTS:ESYJY) {LON:EZJ) added 0.37%, and Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY) 
(LON:RYA) subtracted 0.02%, while Jet2 (LON:JET2) took off 0.59%.Other contributorsHanbury said their U.K. 
construction stocks also did well during the first quarter following strong U.K. macro developments, continued 
government focus and strong financial results. Vistry Group PLC (LON:VTY) contributed 0.47%, Forterra Inc 
(NASDAQ:FRTA) (LON:FORT) added 0.41%, and Travis Perkins (OTCMKTS:TPRKY) returned 0.36%. Ibstock 
(LON:IBST) contributed 0.27%, while SIG plc (LON:SHI) added 0.21%, and Breedon contributed 0.14%. IP Group 
Plc (LON:IPO) added 0.98% due to the return to net asset value growth as seen in the 2020 earnings results. 
Additionally, the firm's largest position, which makes up one-quarter of its net asset value, has started preparing for 
an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. Brook's commodity and cyclical stocks also did well during 
Brook Asset Management had a strong first quarter, is shorting This US education stock [Exclusive]
the first quarter due to strong macro and stimulus data and positive supply side dynamics. ArcelorMittal SA 
(NYSE:MT) contributed 1.05%, while Glencore (OTCMKTS:GLNCY) (LON:GLEN) added 0.88%, SLC Agricola 
(OTCMKTS:SLCJY) returned 0.6%, and Maersk Drilling (OTCMKTS:DDRLG) contributed 0.63%. Rusal 
(MCX:RUAL) returned 0.39%, while Total contributed 0.27%.Biggest detractorsThe fund's biggest detractor during 
the first quarter was AO World (LON:AO), which lost 2.73%. The company reported stronger-than-expected sales 
but weaker profits, and Hanbury expects its March quarter to be similar. However, he also believes AO can report 
"decent" double-digit growth for its March 2022 year. Brook's short book lost money but generated positive alpha. 
Two if its biggest detractors were its private equity investment management shorts. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) 
detracted 1.37%, while Partners Group (OTCMKTS:PGPHF) subtracted 0.67%. Hanbury believes the environment 
will be "unhelpful" to their businesses compared to how it has been over the last decade, but their valuations 
suggest the good times will continue for many years. Eurofins (OTCMKTS:ERRFY) subtracted 0.64% during the 
first quarter. Although Hanbury still feels its valuation is too high and the quality of its accounting is very low, he said 
they made a mistake in underestimating the COVID PCR tests the company has benefited from.Other 
detractorsBrookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY) subtracted 0.47% after its largest shareholder, Brookfield 
Asset Management, bid for it at a 16% premium. CD Projeckt (OTCMKTS:OTGLY) was a good short position during 
the quarter, adding 0.44% on a small position. Hanbury said they established the short position when they believed 
it was priced for perfection in the second half of 2020. The stock plunged when the company's flagship game, 
Cyberpunk 2077, arrived with multiple bugs and was pulled from the PlayStation store. IG Group 
(OTCMKTS:IGGHY) added 0.45% after acquiring Tastytrade for $1 billion. Most of the deal was paid in IG shares 
with twice the multiple that IG trades on itself. Hanbury believes IG is paying a high multiple for a cyclically high 
earnings number in what he calls the kind of deal that's "the antithesis of what we look for in our owner-managed 
businesses where shareholders' cash and shares are generally treated with more respect."Biggest short 
contributorsBrook's biggest contributing short during the quarter was Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ:PTON), 
which took a hit as its important U.S. market improved with the reopening of economies in many states. Peloton 
trades at a value of $16,000 per subscriber, and Hanbury believes the market underestimates the competition and 
demand pull forward that has happened for Peloton's products. The fund's second-biggest contributing short 
position was Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG), a new position Hanbury highlighted in the letter. The company has a $12 
billion market cap and operates in the higher education industry. When it was founded in 2000, it was a digital 
message board where students traded advice on applications, internships and scholarships. After a change in CEO 
and strategic shift in 2007, Chegg focused on renting college textbooks to students. By 2020, it generated about 
20% of its roughly $600 million in revenue from textbook rentals, with the other 80% coming from digital homework 
help products. Hanbury's short thesis is based on concerns about what will happen when students return to campus 
and to their traditional academic support networks. He's also concerned about falling university enrollment and the 
trend toward digital textbooks and courseware. Hanbury also questions whether Chegg's digital homework help 
products actually help students. Multiple news reports last year indicated that college students were using Chegg's 
products to cheat on online exams. Specifically he states: Ultimately, we wonder whether university or even 
government-level action to curtail usage of Chegg may materialise. Finally, we think direct competition is also rising 
as existing competitors like Bartleby and Coursehero fill-out their product range and as textbook publisher Pearson 
launches its own college study app later this year.At its current $88 share price, Chegg trades on EV/sales multiples 
of around 18x and 15x for FY 2020 and 2021 respectively. We feel these multiples are very high given a historical 
lack of underlying profitability and the risks outlined above and we note recent share sales by both the company 
and its CEO.   Top positionsBrook's top 10 long positions as a percentage of net asset value were Plus500 Ltd 
(LON:PLUS), AO World PLC (LON:AO), IWG PLC (LON:IWG), Jet2, ArcelorMittal, Serco Group plc 
(OTCMKTS:SECCF) (LON:SRP), IP Group, Glencore, Conduit Holdings Limited (LON:CRE)and Frasers Group 
PLC (LON:FRAS). During the quarter, Brook rotated some of its airline holdings into oil majors, including trimming 
all names and selling out of Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) and IAG completely. The fund has been adding to 
BP plc (NYSE:BP) (LON:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) and Total SE (NYSE:TOT), which have been 
focusing on their environmental responsibilities. Brook is still overweight the U.K. In the construction space, 
Hanbury finds consensus forecasts to be too pessimistic. Vistry is the only homebuilder the fund owns, and he 
believes it is poorly understood by the market, mostly due to its unusual partnership division. The fund sold its 
Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), AGCO Corporation (NYSE:AGCO) and Nov Inc (NYSE:NOV) positions during 
the quarter. Brook continues to invest in Plus500, which has returned 1,500% since their investment at the initial 
public offering. Hanbury had expected shares to re-rate higher, but that never materialized. However, he still

Ryanair to appeal EU court rulings on Finnair , SAS state aid
Ryanair to appeal EU court rulings on Finnair, SAS state aid

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has said it will appeal a ruling by the General Court of the European Court of Justice on 
April 14 which overturned its complaint against Covid-related government support for SAS Scandinavian Airlines 
(SK, Copenhagen Kastrup) and Finnair (AY, Helsinki Vantaa). The court underlined the European Commission's 
belief that Swedish, Danish, and Finnish financial support for the two flag carriers in the wake of pandemic-related 
travel restrictions was allowed under revised European Union state aid rules. In August 2020, the commission had 
approved Danish and Swedish plans to contribute up to SEK11 billion kronor (USD1.3 billion) to the recapitalisation 
of SAS. In March 2021, the commission approved a Finnish government loan to Finnair of EUR351.38 million euros 
(USD420 million), a measure that took the form of a hybrid loan with the aim of compensating it for losses sustained 
during the travel shutdowns between March 16 and December 31. It had already approved, in June 2020, Finnish 
plans to contribute to the recapitalisation of Finnair with the state investing in new shares in a rights issue launched 
by the airline, equivalent to a EUR286 million (USD343 million) public contribution. 
The court ruled that the financial support to SAS was appropriate under Article 107(2) of the Lisbon Treaty, even if it 
benefited just one company. Consequently, the European Commission "had not erred in law solely because the aid 
measures for SAS did not benefit all of the victims of the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic," it said. The 
court ruled that the SAS credit facility had been proportionate and also pointed to the fact that the commission had 
insisted on reviewing the pandemic's impact for several months after the aid was given, to ensure it was not being 
over-compensated. Moreover, the Swedish and Danish government support did not discriminate against other 
airlines "given that SAS has the largest market share in Denmark and Sweden, and that that market share is much 
higher than that of its closest competitor in those two countries." As for the Finnair case, the state loan guarantee 
was necessary "to maintain Finnair's activities and prevent its possible failure from further disrupting the Finnish 
economy," the court said. In an April 14 statement responding to the court ruling, Ryanair alleged that Finnair had 
"benefited from more than EUR1.2 billion [USD1.44 billion] in state aid since the beginning of the pandemic." "One 
of the EU's greatest achievements is the creation of a true single market for air transport. The European 
Commission's approvals of the Finnish, Danish and Swedish State aid went against the fundamental principles of 
EU law. Today's judgments set the process of liberalisation in air transport back by 30 years by allowing Finland, 
Denmark, and Sweden to give their national flag carriers a leg up over more efficient competitors, based purely on 
nationality," Ryanair protested.

Croatia Airlines demands equal treatment with Ryanair
Croatia Airlines demands equal treatment with Ryanair

Croatia Airlines (OU, Zagreb) has issued an open letter to the operator of Zagreb airport, demanding fee reductions 
and incentives on par with or exceeding those granted to Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), which is set to open a base in 
the Croatian capital in September 2021. "Passengers and the Croatian public have the right to competitive prices 
and complete and objective information. It is unacceptable for the national airline to finance the entry of new 
competitors into the Croatian market," Croatia Airlines wrote, alluding to its position that incentives for Ryanair 
would be financed from fees paid by Croatia Airlines. The flag carrier said that while it welcomed competition, it 
demanded a level playing field. 
It alleged that incentives publicly offered to Ryanair under the recently adopted Growth Incentive Model at the 
airport were distorting the market and would have an adverse effect on Croatia Airlines. Croatia Airlines currently 
accounts for more than 50% of revenues of Medunarodna zracna luka Zagreb (MZLZ), the concessionaire of the 
airport. MZLZ itself is a consortium of six companies, including international airport operators Groupe ADP and TAV 
Airports, as well as Marguerite, International Finance Corporation, Bouygues Bâtiment, and Viadukt. The carrier 
indicated that if it had access to the same terms as granted to Ryanair as a new entrant to the airport, it would have 
reduced its fees paid to MZLZ in 2019 by HRK135.4 million kunas (USD21.4 million), an amount significantly 
exceeding the airline's net loss for that year. In particular, Croatia Airlines took issue with the narrow definition of 
"existing routes", which are enumerated in an appendix to the list of the new fees on an airport basis, rather than 
city or agglomeration. Because of this, even though Croatia Airlines connects Zagreb with Frankfurt Int'l, London 
Heathrow, Paris CDG, or Rome Fiumicino, Ryanair will be awarded new route incentives for its proposed services 
to Frankfurt Hahn, London Stansted, Paris Beauvais, and Rome Ciampino. "We appreciate the efforts of MZLZ to 
ensure new traffic but only on the basis of impartiality, the same conditions for all companies, and without 
concessions. The denial of similar or even greater discounts to Croatia Airlines, taking into account the volume of 
traffic and the number of destinations, endangers fair competition and inflicts direct damage to the national airline 
which is majority-owned by the Republic of Croatia," the carrier said. Ryanair is set to begin operations to Zagreb in 
early June 2020, initially serving the city from existing bases. It will open a base at the Croatian airport on 
September 1, 2021 with two A320-200s operated by Lauda Europe. Ryanair did not respond to ch-aviation's 
request for comment, while MZLZ said it would discuss the issue privately with Croatia Airlines.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday lost further legal challenges to state rescues of rival airlines 
as an EU court cleared pandemic aid to SAS and Finnair.
The cases were part of a legal campaign across Europe by the Irish low-cost airline to stop bailout deals for the 
bloc's legacy airlines.
In the case of Finland's biggest carrier, loan guarantees were "necessary in order to remedy the serious 
disturbance in the Finnish economy in view of the importance of Finnair for that economy," a court statement said.
In a separate decision, the court said state aid given to airline SAS by Sweden and Denmark was legal "given that

Ryanair has long railed against the support given to national champions, and is often backed by the European 
Commission which requests that companies make concessions – such as giving up valuable flight slots in busy 
airports – in return for state aid. 
But state aid rules have been considerably weakened to fight the pandemic and Ryaniar has now lost four cases at 
EU courts.
Ryanair – Europe's biggest airline in terms of passenger numbers – is also seeking to undo Germany's massive 
bailout of Deutsche Lufthansa AG in the EU courts as well as schemes in Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal.
Ryanair has estimated the total state aid to airlines approved by Brussels since the beginning of the pandemic at 
EUR30 billion, including EUR11 billion to Lufthansa, EUR10.6 billion to Air France-KLM SA, EUR3.5 billion to 
Alitalia and EUR1.3 billion to SAS.

BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union court dealt another blow to Ryanair on Wednesday and rejected the 
low-cost carrier's arguments that the aid Sweden, Denmark and Finland gave two other airlines to get through the 
COVID-19 crisis was illegal.
The Luxembourg-based EU General Court said the subsidies Denmark and Sweden granted to Scandinavian 
carrier SAS “comply with EU law.” It said likewise of a Finnish loan guarantee for Finnair.
The General Court handed down two similar decisions two months ago in different cases involving France and 
Sweden.
The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, which polices state aid and other competition issues, has 
approved several aid plans for struggling airline companies in the wake of the pandemic, especially after border 
closures and other restrictions halted most air travel.
Ryanair had argued that the aid constituted unfair state bailouts for national carriers.
A statement from the court on the SAS ruling said it “confirms for the first time the legality of individual aid measures 
adopted in order to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The rulings of the General Court can be appealed on points of law only.

 Europe's second-highest court sided with Finnish flag carrier Finnair (FIA1S.HE) and Swedish airline SAS 
(SAS.ST) in cases filed by Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR), which sought to block state aid for its rivals, 
according to media reports Wednesday.
The European General Court ruled that Swedish and Danish aid for SAS and the Finnair state loan guarantee 
complied with the bloc's state aid rules.
Ryanair reportedly lodged 16 lawsuits against the European Commission for clearing state support to COVID-19-hit 
airlines, arguing that the move creates an unfair advantage, among other reasons.

Ryanair loses EU court challenge to state aid for competitor airlines
Ryanair loses EU court challenge to state aid for competitor airlines

The Irish budget flight company Ryanair was handed a duo of defeats at the European Union's General Court in 
lawsuits against state bailouts for competitor airlines on Wednesday.
The millions of euros in coronavirus-related economic aid provided to Scandinavian airline SAS by Sweden and 
Denmark, and to Finnair by the Finnish government was in line with EU law, judges at the Luxembourg-based court 
found.
Ryanair immediately announced it would appeal the two rulings at the bloc's highest court, the European Court of 
Justice.
The company had challenged decisions by the European Commission - which oversees competition in the single 
market - to approve the aid packages.
But the EU judges found that the measures taken to prop up SAS were proportionate.
In the case of Finnair, they noted above all that a possible default would have had a considerable impact on 
Finland's economic health.In both cases, the state aid was found to be appropriate to achieve the objective 
pursued.In recent months, Ryanair has taken several state aid cases to the bloc's high court Court of Justice. In 
February, the company already failed in legal action against aid granted by France and Sweden.

Apr 14, 2021( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  BRUSSELS (AP) — A top 
European Union court dealt another blow to Ryanair on Wednesday and rejected the low-cost carrier's arguments 
that the aid Sweden, Denmark and Finland gave two other airlines to get through the COVID-19 crisis was illegal.  
The Luxembourg-based EU General Court said the subsidies Denmark and Sweden granted to Scandinavian 
carrier SAS 'comply with EU law.' 
It said likewise of a Finnish loan guarantee for Finnair. The General Court handed down two similar decisions two 
months ago in different cases involving France and Sweden.  The EU's executive arm, the European Commission, 
which polices state aid and other competition issues, has approved several aid plans for struggling airline 
companies in the wake of the pandemic, especially after border closures and other restrictions halted most air 
travel. Ryanair had argued that the aid constituted unfair state bailouts for national carriers. A statement from the 
court on the SAS ruling said it 'confirms for the first time the legality of individual aid measures adopted in order to 
address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.'  The rulings of the General Court can be appealed on 
points of law only. Featured Article: Dual Listing What You Need to Know[1]7 Things You Need To Know About

manufacturer Boeing said Friday it had recommended that 16 clients flying its 737 MAX models address a "potential 
electrical issue", a new setback for its most popular plane.Boeing managed to get the 737 MAX back into the late 
last year after it was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes, and recently announced an order for 100 
of the aircraft as the airline sector begins to recover from the coronavirus pandemic."Boeing has recommended to 
16 customers that they address a potential electrical issue in a specific group of 737 MAX airplanes prior to further 
operations," the company said Friday in a statement.The potential problem identified Friday requires "verification 
that a sufficient ground path exists for a component of the electrical power system", it said.Electrical systems must 
be grounded to avoid overloads that can cause serious failures.Boeing did not say which airlines were concerned 
nor did it give the number of aircraft involved.The plane maker did say it was "working closely" with the US Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) and would direct clients on how to resolve the issue. The 737 MAX has been a huge 
hit with airlines, and was Boeing's best-selling aircraft until it was grounded in March 2019.Around 450 of the planes 
have been delivered to date to 49 airlines or aircraft leasing companies.After the Covid-19 crisis hammered the air 
transport sector, airlines cancelled hundreds of orders however.Boeing currently has more than 400 aircraft waiting 
to be delivered to clients, and does not expect to eliminate that stock until sometime next year.

Ryanair has warned it will carry fewer passengers than expected during the next year and struggle to turn a profit 
because of the slow rollout of vaccinations across much of Europe.
The carrier said lockdowns and travel restrictions had hit travel during Easter and it expected a delayed recovery in 
traffic into the summer season.
It forecasts passenger numbers in the year ending March 2022 towards the lower end of a previously guided range 
of between 80m and 120m.
New figures reveal the depth of the crisis facing the industry, with bookings for this summer on airlines across 
Europe below a fifth of normal levels.
Although several airlines have trumpeted an increase in summer business, the International Air Transport 
Association yesterday said passenger bookings for travel across Europe between May and September had reached 
just 15 per cent of 2019 levels by March 20.
Ryanair warned that some analyst forecasts saying it would return to profit in the next year were too optimistic.
"While it is not possible at this time to provide meaningful full-year 2022 profit guidance, we do not share the recent 
optimism of certain analysts," Ryanair said, adding that it expected to approximately break even. Analysts had 
forecast a profit after tax of (EURO)277m, according to Bloomberg.
Ryanair bemoans EU vaccine rollout; Airlines
Just two weeks ago Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, projected a strong summer of travel across Europe, 
saying the airline would be flying 80 per cent of normal schedules by June.
Analysts believe Ryanair will, in the long term, emerge from the crisis as a winner in European aviation, helped by a 
low cost base and strong balance sheet.
For now, however, it remains exposed to travel restrictions and rising Covid-19 cases in continental Europe.
The UK government has taken a cautious approach to reopening its borders, which are closed until mid-May at the 
earliest, and this week Boris Johnson, the prime minister, warned it was still too soon to book a summer holiday.
"The current delay on UK government travel guidance is playing havoc with airline planning," said Mark Simpson, 
an analyst at Goodbody.
Ryanair expects a net loss before exceptional items of (EURO)800m to (EURO)850m for the year ending March 
2021. It carried 27.5m passengers in the year, down from 149m in the previous 12 months.

Apr 08, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Avelo Airlines just 
broke cover and plans to start flights on April 28 from Burbank, California. Andrew Levy, former president of 
Allegiant Air, is at the helm with a focus on cheap flights and friendly service. A total of 11 routes have already been 
announced to popular destinations across the American West. See more stories on Insider's business page[1].It's 
lights, cameras, action for America's newest airline that's planning its Hollywood debut later this month. 
Avelo Airlines plans to launch flights on April 28 from Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, giving travelers 
yet another option when planning pandemic getaways. The new ultra-low-cost airline is focused on cheap leisure 
flights and will fly to popular destinations in the American West from before expanding across the country. "Avelo is 
a different and better kind of airline, built from scratch to offer an affordable, convenient and caring travel 
experience," chief executive Andrew Levy said in a press release. The initial slate of 11 routes from Burbank 
include flights to: Santa Rosa, California from April 28;Pasco, Washington from April 29;Bozeman, Montana from 
April 30;Phoenix, Arizona from May 3;Ogden, Utah from May 4;Grand Junction,Colorado from May 9; 
Medford,Oregon from May 9;Eugene, Oregon from May 12;Bend, Oregon from May 13;Eureka, California from May 
19; andRedding, California from May 20. Burbank, just north of downtown Los Angeles, offers a convenient 
alternative to Los Angeles International Airport that the company hopes will help spur bookings and encourage 
flyers to travel. "A big part of our business model is not just offering every day, great fares," Levy told Insider. 
"We're a low-cost carrier. We're built to offer low fares, but at the same time we're going to offer a great level of 
convenience by utilizing Burbank, which we think is probably the best secondary airport in the country."An airport 
stuck in time, the one-story terminal building at Burbank resembles a scene from the 1950s. Passengers are 
required to board aircraft directly from the tarmac since there are no jetways. . The Boeing 737-800, a tried and true 
narrow-body aircraft that can seat 189 people in the airline's all-economy configuration, will be Avelo's flagship 
aircraft. The plane is a staple of other well-known low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, 
and Ryanair thanks to its low operating costs and high availability on the market. In true ultra-low-cost fashion, 
flyers won't find seat-back entertainment screens - though WiFi may be coming within the next year. Avelo says it's 
working with potential suppliers for the service. In-flight snacks and drinks service won't be offered in the airline's 
initial run, either, due to the pandemic. Customers will instead receive a "convenience package" with hand sanitizer,

Avelo Airlines
a bottle of water, and a small snack. The bulk of the aircraft's seating are "slimline" seats, the term for thinner seats 
on airplanes, with only 29 inches of pitch across the 129 seats. The remaining 60 seats, however, will range in pitch 
from 31 to 38 inches, and reserving one will cost at least $18. Fares as low as $19 are being offered on all of the 
airline's initial routes from April into mid-June for some destinations, except for flights around Memorial Day 
Weekend. They're just introductory fares but low ticket prices are part of Avelo's overall strategy to stimulate 
demand in underserved markets and become a go-to for cheap flights."Quite honestly, I'd love to be able to do, 
over many years, what Southwest has done," Levy said. "Where when people hear 'Avelo,' they just associate us 
with low fares."Offering low fares, however, means that Avelo will have to fill its planes as close to the brim as 
possible in order to turn a profit. "We're looking to sell the flights very full, we're defining full as 80-85%," Levy 
said.And unlike competitors, Avelo doesn't have a robust system of extra fees to fall back on. Advanced seat 
assignments start at $5 and checking a bag will only cost $10, with the latter meant to open more space in the cabin 
during boarding and deplaning. There's also no fee to make a flight change or make a reservation over the phone. 
These extra charges, known as ancillary fees, have become the backbone of ultra-low-cost airlines' strategy as they 
don't incur taxes. Keeping calm during a crippling pandemic for airlines Avelo, one of two low-cost airlines launching 
operations during the pandemic[2], has the benefit of an experienced founder. Levy formerly served as the co-
founder and president of Allegiant Air and chief financial officer of United Airlines. "I think probably during the 
pandemic, maybe the hardest thing was just to keep everybody calm and to recognize that there's a lot of good 
that's going to come from the end of the business cycle," Levy said.The industry veteran was actually optimistic 
instead of pessimistic when the pandemic hit the US in March 2020. Leveling the playing field for airlines made it 
easier for a new entrant to compete with established players. Congress ultimately saved many airlines from 
possible bankruptcy, but the pandemic's outcome still favors leisure airlines like Avelo, analysts say. More 
Americans are willing to get back in the air after an extended pandemic[3] and ultra-low-cost airlines are allowing 
them to do it without breaking the bank. Read More: Spirit Airlines' low-cost model puts it in the perfect spot to be 
the big winner of the pandemic, a Deutsche Bank analyst says[4]"I think all of our investors realize that this will 
have been a pretty strong opportunity for us to get into markets we otherwise wouldn't have been able to get into, 
take advantage of materially lower costs for things like airplanes, office leases, IT contracts, parts agreements, 
etc.," Levy said. Avelo currently has three planes and more than 200 crew members but plans to have six Boeing 
737s and 400 crew members by the end of the year. Read the original article on Business Insider[5] [ 1]:

RYAAY[1] anticipates its fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022) traffic to be hit by adversities arising from the European 
Union's slow vaccine rollout.Per a statement[2], the company estimates its fiscal 2022 traffic to be at the low end of 
the guided range of 80 million-120 million passengers, as a result of 'Easter travel restrictions/lockdowns and a 
delayed traffic recovery into the peak summer 21 season, due to the slow rollout in the EU of COVID-19 vaccines'. 
Additionally, the Irish low-cost airline stated that it expects to nearly break even in fiscal 2022.However, on a 
positive note, Ryanair narrowed its guidance for net loss in fiscal 2021 (ended Mar 31, 2021) to €800 million-€850 
million from €850 million-€950 million expected previously. Meanwhile, Ryanair Group's fiscal 2021 traffic declined 
to 27.5 million passengers from 149 million in fiscal 2020 due to coronavirus-induced flight cancellations and travel 
restrictions. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/fundamental/price?icid=chart-

Ryanair sees break-even earnings amid slow COVID-19 recovery
Ryanair sees break-even earnings amid slow COVID-19 recovery

LONDON (AP) — Ryanair, Europe’s biggest discount airline, says earnings for the current fiscal year are likely to 
be “close to breakeven” as continued travel restrictions delay its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pessimistic outlook came as the airline said Wednesday that the airline industry is facing a delayed recovery 
going into the peak summer season because of the slow rollout of coronavirus vaccines in the European Union.
“While it is not possible, at this time, to provide meaningful (fiscal year 2022) profit guidance, we do not share the 
recent optimism of certain analysts as we believe that the outcome for FY22 is currently close to breakeven,” the 
company said in a statement.
Ryanair’s passenger traffic fell 81.5% to 27.5 million passengers in the fiscal year ended March 31 as lockdown 
orders and travel restrictions forced people to stay home. The airline said it expects traffic for the current year to be 
near the lower end of its previously forecast range of 80 million to 120 million passengers.
The airline said Wednesday that it expects to report a net loss of between 800 million euros ($950 million) and 850 
million euros ($1 billion) for the 12 months through March. That’s an improvement over its previous forecast for a 
loss of between 850 million euros and 950 million euros.
Ryanair will report earnings for the 2021 fiscal year on May 17.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) has lowered its loss forecast for the year just ended but said Easter had seen 
fewer passengers than expected which will affect the current twelve months' numbers.
The Irish carrier now expects a pre-exceptional net loss of between (EURO)800mln and (EURO)850m in the year to 
end 31 March 2021 against (EURO)850mln to (EURO)950mln guided previously.
For the current year (to March 2022), Ryanair said traffic is likely to be towards the lower end of its 80mln to 120mln 
passengers guidance due to the Easter travel restrictions/lockdowns and the slow rollout in the EU of Covid-19 
vaccines.
The airline added that the financial outcome for FY22 based on this revision is currently close to breakeven.
Traffic in the year just ended was 27.5mln passengers (down from 149mln in FY20) due to Covid-19 flight 
cancellations and travel restrictions.
Ryanair's said year-end cash (31 March) was over (EURO)3.15bn, while more than 84% of the group's owned fleet 
of 420 B737 aircraft was unencumbered.
Full-year results will be released on 17 May.
Peel Hunt said it had been forecasting a net profit of (EURO)449m for this current year and the consensus is 
(EURO)394mln, so the group's outlook was disappointing and 'whilst it shows some recovery in demand with a 
likely further improvement in FY23E, it is significantly weaker than the stock is discounting'.
Ryanair update dashes City hopes of quick airline recovery
Sell is Peel Hunt's investment recommendation, with the broker adding it expects a similar downbeat outlook for the 
other airlines, most notably Wizz Air.
Ryanair shares rose 1% to (EURO)17.

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Wednesday said it expects to report fiscal 2021 pre-
exceptional net loss of between 800 million euros and 850 million euros, narrower than previously expected net loss 
between 850 million euros and 950 million euros.
 The full-year traffic was 27.5 million, sharply lower than prior year's 149 million, due to Covid-19 government flight 
cancellations and travel restrictions.
 The company said its year-end cash as of March 31 was over 3.15 billion euros, while more than 84% of its owned 
fleet of 420 B737 aircraft are unencumbered.
 Looking ahead, the company now expects that fiscal 2022 traffic is likely to be towards the lower end of its 
previously guided range of 80 million to 120 million passengers. The outlook revision reflects Easter travel 
restrictions/lockdowns and a delayed traffic recovery into the peak Summer 21 season, due to the slow rollout in the 
EU of Covid-19 vaccines.
 "While it is not possible (at this time) to provide meaningful FY22 profit guidance, we do not share the recent 
optimism of certain analysts as we believe that the outcome for FY22 is currently close to breakeven," the company 
said.
 Ryanair is scheduled to release its fiscal 2021 results on May 17.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday trimmed its annual loss estimate but warned traffic in its 
current financial year will be at the lower end of the carrier's guidance range. 
For the year ended March 31, financial 2021, Ryanair expects to post a net loss, before exceptional items, between 
EUR800 million and EUR850 million. The airline company's previous forecast was for a loss between EUR850 
million and EUR950 million. 
Despite the forecast being slightly improved, it is still a wild swing from the EUR1.00 billion of pre-exceptional, post-
tax profit Ryanair made in financial 2020. 
What's more, the company cautioned on traffic for financial 2022. 
"FY22 traffic is likely to be towards the lower end of our previously guided range of 80 million to 120 million 
passengers," the company warned.
Ryanair said it was hurt by Easter travel curbs and the EU's slow Covid-19 vaccine rollout. And on earnings for the 
current financial year, the company was also slightly pessimistic. 
"While it is not possible (at this time) to provide meaningful FY22 profit guidance, we do not share the recent 
optimism of certain analysts as we believe that the outcome for FY22 is currently close to breakeven," Ryaniar 
explained. 
Ryanair reports on its financial 2021 results on May 17.
On Tuesday, Ryanair reported a slump in passenger numbers for March. It saw just 500,000 passengers in March, 
down 91% from 5.5 million a year ago. The firm said it operated just 5% of its normal March schedule with a 77% 
load factor.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) said the state bailout of Air France-KLM (AF.PA, AF.AS) by France will hurt competition 
for "decades to come," Reuters reported Wednesday, citing an emailed statement.
Air France-KLM recently secured a rescue package of 4 billion euros ($4.75 billion) amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 
under which the French government will increase its stake in the airline to almost 30%.
"The 18 slots that Air France is being required to make available is nowhere near enough to allow others to offer a 
competitive challenge to Air France's dominance at Paris Charles de Gaulle and Paris Orly airports," Ryanair said.
Ryanair's shares declined marginally, while Air France-KLM jumped almost 3% on Wednesday morning.

Apr 07, 2021( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  LONDON (AP) — Ryanair, 
Europe's biggest discount airline, says earnings for the current fiscal year are likely to be 'close to breakeven' as 
continued travel restrictions delay its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pessimistic outlook came as the 
airline said Wednesday that the airline industry is facing a delayed recovery going into the peak summer season 
because of the slow rollout of coronavirus vaccines in the European Union. 'While it is not possible, at this time, to 
provide meaningful (fiscal year 2022) profit guidance, we do not share the recent optimism of certain analysts as we 
believe that the outcome for FY22 is currently close to breakeven,' the company said in a statement. 
Ryanair's passenger traffic fell 81.5% to 27.5 million passengers in the fiscal year ended March 31 as lockdown 
orders and travel restrictions forced people to stay home. The airline said it expects traffic for the current year to be 
near the lower end of its previously forecast range of 80 million to 120 million passengers. The airline said 
Wednesday that it expects to report a net loss of between 800 million euros ($950 million) and 850 million euros ($1 
billion) for the 12 months through March. That's an improvement over its previous forecast for a loss of between 
850 million euros and 950 million euros. Ryanair will report earnings for the 2021 fiscal year on May 17. ___ Follow

Betting Stocks That Will Shine Beyond March Madness[1]One of the many consequences of the novel coronavirus 
was the shutdown of live sports. For sports-minded individuals, one of the events that were missed the most was 
the NCAA Basketball Tournament affectionately known as March Madness. But in addition to missing the 
entertainment that sports provide, cities and states realized, if they didn't already, that sports are an economic 
necessity. Live sports may also be a key to their post-pandemic future. But this goes beyond hotels and 
restaurants. Sports betting has become big business. Currently, 25 states and the District of Columbia have 
legalized sports betting either by statute or by ballot initiative. That list is likely to grow. Many states face budget 
deficits and want to legalize sports betting for the revenue that it could receive. And this is about more than allowing 
gamblers to place bets via a sportsbook in a casino. The real driver for this is mobile sports betting. According to 
the American Gaming Association, over 47 million people are expected to place bets during the NCAA basketball 
tournament, with approximately one-third of those bets (17.8 million) being placed online. To help you take 
advantage of this still-emerging trend, we've put together this special presentation. Here we'll highlight seven sports

Apr 07, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
management at the Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Areas Inteligentes GOL[1] stated that the airline operated 
only 245 domestic flights per day (on average) in March compared with 355 and 489 flights a day, on average, in 
the respective months of February and January. This sharp decline was due to Brazil being hit by the second wave 
of coronavirus cases. Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[2] March traffic report was also dismal due to a fresh spike in 
COVID-19 gripping many countries in Europe.However, in the United States, air-travel demand is northbound as 
more and more Americans get vaccinated with each passing day. Anticipating this demand to surge further in the 
upcoming summer season, Southwest Airlines LUV[3] recalled some of its pilots from the coronavirus-induced 
voluntary leave. 
Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines SAVE[4] announced an expansion update in response to the air-travel demand uptick in 
the United States.Notably,United Airlines UAL[5] also recently announced its plan to bolster its domestic network in 
a bid to meet the expected recovery in air-travel demand during summer. This was mentioned in detail in 
theprevious week's writeup[6]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. At Gol Linhas, traffic, measured 
in revenue passenger kilometers, plunged 47.7% year over year in March. In the same month, capacity measured 
in available seat kilometers contracted 47.8%. Since traffic decline was marginally less than capacity contraction, 
load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) inched up 0.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 71.8%. 
Gol Linhas' total monthly departures slumped 52% while seats tanked 50.7%. Due to the recent spike in COVID-19 
cases, demand in the domestic market declined 32% during March from the February levels. Moreover, supply 
contracted 23% in the same month on a month-over-month basis due to the reduction in demand for tickets coupled 
with increased cancellations and no-shows[7].2. Ryanair's March traffic tanked 91% year over year to merely 0.5 
million guests. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair dived 81% to 27.5 million. The carrier's load factor in 
the month was 77% compared with 91% a year ago[8].3. Per aReuters report[9],Southwest Airlines, currently 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), recalled 209 pilots from a voluntary extended leave program as it prepares to 
meet the anticipated increase in travel demand during the summer season. Per the report, the pilots' status will 
become active Jun 1 onward. Prior to their resumption of duty, they will complete the necessary requalification 
training requirements. Other airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines DAL[10] also called back pilots, rendered 
inactive by the pandemic as the report suggests.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong

(LAX) with Mexico's Los Cabos International Airport on May 5. Notably, this marks the low-cost carrier's first

Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and

disappointing air-travel demand following the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil, have traded in the 
green over the past week. Evidently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 2.4% over the past week to

Ryanair and Wizz Air passenger numbers collapse in March as COVID-19 continues to ravage travel sector
Ryanair and Wizz Air passenger numbers collapse in March as COVID-19 
continues to ravage travel sector

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) both reported a plunge in passenger 
numbers in March as travel bans and other fallout from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continued to savage 
the travel industry.
In its traffic statistics for March, Ryanair reported it carried 0.5mln passengers in March, a 91% decline year-on-year 
with a load factor of 77%, while its rolling annual passenger number plummeted 81% to 27.5mln.

Things were similarly bleak at Wizz Air, where passenger numbers fell 72.6% in March to 480,203, while its load 
factor sank 29.4 percentage points (ppts) to 62.5%.
On a rolling annual basis, the airline's passenger numbers were down 74.6% at 10.2mln, while the load factor was 
down 29.6 ppts at 63.9%.
Despite the effects of the pandemic, Wizz continued to detail its expansion efforts, including its forty-second base in 
Palermo, Italy, as well as new routes from Tel Aviv to destinations in Greece, from Abu Dhabi to destinations in 
Kazakhstan and from Poland to five new destinations across the Mediterranean.

Ryanair and Wizz Air passenger numbers collapse in March as COVID-19 continues to ravage travel sector
However, the fortunes of the budget airlines are unlikely to improve in the coming months after the UK government 
unveiled plans for a 'traffic light' system with three tiers for international travel, while also not confirming whether 
travel to other countries will be able to resume on May 17 as originally outlined in its lockdown easing roadmap.
Analysts at Peel Hunt, which rates Ryanair at 'sell' with a target price of (EURO)12 and Wizz Air at 'sell' with a 
3,300p target, said in a note on Tuesday the lack of clarity on international travel is "likely to restrict short-term cash 
flow" for the airlines, while the risk of destinations moving between the traffic light restrictions "also likely to 
discourage international travel and may result in overcapacity and dressed yields".
As a result, the broker said a worse 2021 summer is "likely to result in higher net debt" for both airlines while 
consumer behaviour may also change permanently, posing risks to demand for business travel and migration in the 
long term.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.7% at (EURO)16.51 in early deals, while Wizz Air dropped 0.5% to 4,949p.

Airline stocks came back from the long Easter weekend with mixed reactions as rules on international trips remain a 
question mark.
Boris Johnson said on Monday he was "hopeful" that international travel could resume on May 17 as per roadmap, 
but it is too early to make a firm decision.
READ: Ryanair and Wizz Air passenger numbers collapse in March as COVID-19 continues to ravage travel 
sector
The government said it will confirm "in advance" of that date but uncertainty remains because of infection and 
vaccination rates in other countries.
When foreign travel will be allowed again, Westminster is planning to implement a 'traffic light' system based on the 
level of risk in the country where the passengers are coming from.
It would add a 'green' category to the current system, with people not required to quarantine although COVID-19 
tests will remain mandatory, although no countries have been added to the list yet.
It's also not clear whether vaccinations will remove the need for these measures and whether a 'covid passport' will 
be agreed with Europe.
Airlines show inconsistent reactions amid confusion on international travel following Prime Minister's statement
According to current measures, travellers from the UK and the European Schengen area can't enter the US while 
the EU Commission is discouraging non-essential travel to and from the UK.
"Beyond disappointing"
The latest announcement was met with criticism by big industry names.
easyJet plc's (LON:EZJ) boss Johan Lundgren said that the traffic light system would prove too expensive if people 
coming from 'green' countries have to take pre-departure and post-arrival tests, which could cost up to £200 each.
"You wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it," he told the BBC.
"If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destination... [Multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it 
would add to cost and complexities."
Trade bodies have called for more details to plan ahead, with the Business Travel Association saying that Boris 
Johnson's statement was "beyond disappointing".
"Whilst we support the establishment of a framework for restarting international travel and welcome the removal of 
self-isolation for arrivals from green countries, today's announcement does not provide the clarity we were seeking 
on the roadmap back towards normality," said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK.
Some stocks rise despite sector pressure
London-listed airlines had mixed reactions, with British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA 
(LON:IAG) adding 2% to 214.5p, TUI AG (LON:TUI) rising 1% to 385.6p and easyJet staying parked at 1,008p.
Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) advanced 1% to 5,024p and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) shed 1% to 
(EURO)16.58 although they both reported a plunge in March passenger numbers earlier on Tuesday.
Analysts at Peel Hunt said that the continued uncertainty, alongside the UK government advising against booking, 
is likely to restrict short-term cash flow and make yield management "much more difficult".
"The risk that destinations move from green to amber or red is also likely to discourage international travel and may 
result in overcapacity and depressed yields," analysts commented.
The broker noted that demand for holidays should return as soon as it is permitted but demand for business travel 
and migration may not bounce back as quickly.
This could hit Ryanair and Wizz Air because they are not purely holiday companies.
Meanwhile, analysts at Berenberg believe TUI faces an uncertain future with a capital structure which is 
unsustainable, significant debt maturities rapidly approaching, doubt about the resumption of operations and 
continued meaningful cash burn.
TUI confirmed at its first-quarter results in February that 2.8mln bookings had been made for the summer season, 
yet despite the apparent surge as vaccinations accelerated, the same number of bookings had been made six 
weeks later at the AGM.
This means that as many bookings were cancelled as were booked in the intervening period, the broker said, 
adding that shares in the FTSE 250 firm remain overvalued.

       European stocks advanced on Tuesday as investors looked past the region's slow pace of vaccinations to 
focus on signs of a robust U.S. economic recovery.
 The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.7 percent at 435.39 after climbing as much as 1 percent to a 
record high earlier in the day.
 The German DAX jumped 0.9 percent, France's CAC 40 index rose 0.6 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 
1.1 percent.
 Miners Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore rose 3-4 percent on optimism for a swift economic recovery.
 BP Plc climbed 3.1 percent and Royal Dutch Shell added 1.1 percent as oil prices rebounded on dollar weakness.
 Banks and automakers were also broadly higher on economic recovery hopes.
 Airline easyJet was little changed and Ryanair lost about 1 percent after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
warned against booking foreign summer holidays.
 Oxford Biomedica, a gene and cell therapy group, rallied 2.2 percent after it signed a new three year Development 
& Supply Agreement with German Pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim for the manufacture and supply 
of various types of viral vectors.
 Credit Suisse Group shares gained 0.7 percent. The Swiss lender today announced the departure of two top 
executives and said it expects a one-time charge of 4.4 billion franc ($4.7 billion) writedown tied to the implosion of 
Archegos Capital Management.
 Suez SA shares were little changed. The waste and water utility fighting the takeover ambitions of rival Veolia 
Environnement SA, has reached an agreement to sell its Australian business to Cleanaway Waste Management 
Ltd.
 In economic releases, Eurozone investor confidence reached its strongest level in more than two years in April as 
lockdowns in many euro area countries had little effect on the overall economic recovery, survey data from Sentix 
showed.
 The investor confidence index rose sharply to 13.1 in April from 5.0 in March. This was the highest level since 
August 2018 and well above economists' forecast of 7.5.
 Although the Eurozone economy recently lagged significantly behind the global trend, it started to catch up in April, 
the survey revealed.

 New car registrations in the U.K. climbed 12 percent annually in March, the first month of growth since August, an

weekend.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday reported slumps in passenger numbers for 
March.
Budget airline Ryanair reported 500,000 passengers for March, down 91% on 5.5 million a year ago. The firm said it 
operated just 5% of its normal March schedule with a 77% load factor. 
Wizz Air, meanwhile, reported 480,203 passengers in March, down 73% on a year ago, when it carried 1.8 million. 
This was at a load factor of 62.5%, down 29.4 percentage points from 92.0%. Wizz said it operated just below 20% 
of its capacity last month.
Year-on-year comparisons for both airlines should get easier from here following the anniversary of the first virus 
lockdowns in Europe in late March last year.
On Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country must be "realistic" over the resumption of foreign 
holidays due to "a surge" of coronavirus in popular destinations.
A global travel taskforce review warned "the state of the pandemic abroad, and the progress of vaccination 
programmes in other countries" meant it was impossible to say yet whether foreign holidays would be allowed from 
May 17, the date earmarked as the earliest possible for the resumption of international trips.
It confirmed the government is examining a traffic-light system for countries, with travel to green list nations 
requiring no quarantine on return to the UK – although tests will still be required – although it is too early to say 
which destinations will be in that category.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.3% at EUR16.57 in London on Tuesday, while Wizz Air was up 0.6% at 5,004.00 
pence.

Apr 06, 2021( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
European Union has approved a plan to prop up Air France amid a pandemic-induced collapse in passenger 
numbers. In return, the airline must give up some flight slots to competitors.The European Commission on Tuesday 
gave the go-ahead for the French government to inject up to €4 billion ($4.7 billion) into its national carrier Air 
France.Although the airline is struggling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rescue package did come 
with conditions.What terms did the EU impose?
In a statement, the commission — which acts to ensure that state aid does not give companies an unfair advantage 
— said Paris is allowed to contribute €4 billion to help keep Air France afloat.However, to access the help, the 
airline would have to relinquish about 18 takeoff and landing slots per day at Orly, Paris' second-largest hub after 
Charles de Gaulle."The public support will come with strings attached, in particular, to ensure the French state is 
sufficiently remunerated, and further measures to limit distortions of competition," said EU Competition 
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."This gives competing carriers the chance to expand their activities at this 
airport, ensuring fair prices and increased choice for European consumers."French Finance Minister Bruno Le 
Maire said the French state would also be allowed to raise its stake in the national carrier from the current 14.3% to 
30%."This is good news for Air France and good news for the French," Le Maire told the France Inter radio 
station.Dutch stake to be dilutedThe French recapitalization means the Dutch government must accept a reduction 
of its 14% share of the Air France-KLM holding company — a surprise acquisition it made in 2019.Dutch Finance 
Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the government of the Netherlands has agreed to allow its stake to be diluted to 
9.3%.In a previous round of support around COVID-19 last year, France gave Air France-KLM €7 billion. 
Meanwhile, the Netherlands provided €3.4 billion in loans and loan guarantees.The airline KLM is not expected to 
benefit from the latest round of French aid.Previous challenges by RyanairBudget Irish carrier Ryanair has 
challenged previous French aid for Air France, saying it distorts competition.In the past, the commission has often 
said it sympathizes with Ryanair's criticism of state subsidies for legacy national airlines.In February, Ryanair lost a 
legal fight in the EU General Court against state aid being granted to Air France and Sweden's SAS through 
national schemes.In EU courts, Ryanair is seeking to contest the German government's bailout of Lufthansa, as 
well as similar schemes in Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal.

Apr 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With the resurgence of 
coronavirus cases gripping several parts of Europe including the UK, Ireland and some other countries in the EU, it 
was pretty predictable that the Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] March traffic report will be poor. 
The fresh wave of the pandemic only worsened the already tepid air-travel demand as a result of the reimposed 
travel-related restrictions.The European carrier's March traffic declined 91% year over year to merely 0.5 million 
guests. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair dived 81% to 27.5 million. 
The carrier's load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the month was 77% compared with 91% a 
year ago.Due to the renewed spike in coronavirus cases induced by the new strains, shares of Ryanair have 
underperformed its industry[2]'s growth over the past month. While the stock has gained 2.3%, the industry has 
appreciated 3.4%.The traffic data apart, Ryanair was in news recently when the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) reportedly[3] approved the design for the Boeing 737-8200 jets, which are basically a higher-passenger 
capacity version of the 737-8 MAX.The clearance of the design was necessary before The Boeing Company BA[4] 
can start delivering these higher-capacity jets to Ryanair. In December 2020, the carrier announced the placement 
of a firm order for 75 additional 737 MAX 8200 planes. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broaderTransportation[5]sector areUSA Truck, Inc. USAK[6]

to see Ryanair resuming its base at Pafos airport and we look forward to a good restart. The launch of the airline's

with a significant benefit to the tourism industry and the economy of the country.

Nordica is Estonian Air successor, court says; inherits debt

Tallinn Circuit Court has legally recognised Nordica (ND, Tallinn Lennart Meri) as the successor to Estonian Air - 
and must settle unpaid staff wages and return state aid that had been granted to the defunct flag carrier and was 
ruled as illegal, the Estonian broadcaster ERR has reported. The second-tier court found on March 31 that Estonian 
Air, which ceased operations in November 2015, has a legal successor in state-owned Nordica, a company legally 
incorporated as Nordic Aviation Group that took on the role as Estonia's flag carrier when it was launched that 
same month. The virtual carrier owns the ACMI/charter subsidiary Xfly (EE, Tallinn Lennart Meri) as well as 
Transpordi Varahaldus, a lessor financed by privately-owned banks which owns some of Xfly's fleet, though there 
are plans to merge the lessor with Nordica. 
The court ruled that the company owes the outstanding wages to Estonian Air's former employees, estimated at 
EUR1.5 million euros (USD1.77 million), and that other outstanding creditors could also file claims with the courts. 
While Estonia's government has not yet expressed an opinion on the issue, only promising further meetings before 
making any major decisions, Nordica CEO Erki Urva commented that the money owed to former staff could be paid 
but added that the state had no plans to reclaim the aid it granted to Estonian Air. On March 27, the same court had 
rejected Nordica's appeal over the outstanding salaries.The European Commission ruled in November 2015 that 
the original state aid, which totalled EUR85 million (USD95 million at the time) "plus interest", breached EU law, a 
ruling that prompted the airline to be wound up. Nordica started operations one day after Estonian Air ceased and 
eventually relaunched many of its destinations. According to lawyers, other creditors besides the state included 
Estonia's Tax and Customs Board and several firms in the private sector, taking the total debt over the EUR100 
million (USD117 million) mark. In related news, Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has challenged the European 
Commission's decision last year to allow Covid-era state aid to Nordica. In a "position on Estonia's intervention" in 
Case T-769/20 (Ryanair v European Commission) posted on the Estonian government's website on March 31, 
Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets said that Ryanair had put forward four pleas, the most important of which was 
that the commission had misapplied EU state aid rules. "Estonia wishes to intervene and support the commission in 
Case T-769/20, as it is important for Estonia that the General Court [of the European Union] does not annul the 
commission's decision to grant state aid. The state, as the owner, decided to support Nordica because it is an 
important company for the state, whose operations and liquidity were severely disrupted economically due to the 
virus," the minister said.

this page has been deleted. Discussion of markets and holdingsMarch 15, 2021 Dear Unitholders of Chou Europe 
Fund, The net asset value per unit ("NAVPU") of a Series A unit of Chou Europe Fund at December 31, 2020 was 
$11.17 compared to $8.78 at December 31, 2019, an increase of 27.2%; during the same period, the MSCI AC 
(Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country) Europe Total Return Index in Canadian dollars increased 3.6%. 
In U.S. dollars, a Series A unit of Chou Europe Fund was up 29.8% while the MSCI AC Europe Total Return Index 
increased 5.3%. The table shows our one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 15-year annual compound rates 
of return.Rates of return are historical total returns that include changes in unit prices, and assume the reinvestment 
of all distributions. These annual compounded returns do not take into account any sales charges, redemption fees, 
other optional expenses or income taxes that you have to pay and that could reduce these returns. 
The returns are not guaranteed. The Fund's past performance does not necessarily indicate future performance. 
The table is used only to illustrate the effects of the compound growth rate and is not intended to reflect future 
values of the mutual funds or returns on the mutual funds. Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees 
and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the prospectus before investing. 
Factors Influencing the 2020 Results The equity holdings of CPL Resources, Ryanair Holdings, Fiat Chrysler 
Automobiles NV and Abbey PLC contributed positively to the Fund's performance during the year. The Euro 
appreciated against the Canadian currency during the period, which also contributed positively to the performance 
of the Fund. During the period, the Fund initiated investments in Jet2 PLC (formerly Dart Group plc) and Wizz Air 
Holdings. In addition, the fund sold holdings in Bank of Ireland, Eurobank Ergasias S.A., Sanofi and Intralot S.A. 
The Fund had no covered call options in its portfolio as at December 31, 2020. Portfolio Commentary Ultra Low 
Cost Carriers ("ULCC") The airline industry got clobbered in this COVID-19 pandemic. With all the restrictions 
regarding social distancing and face masks to limit virus spread, it may be a while before revenues come back to 
pre-COVID levels. After the 9/11 incident it took the airline industry close to six years to return to normal. However, 
we believe there is bright spot in a small segment of the airline industry. It is called the Ultra Low Cost Carrier 
(ULCC) airlines. Their success depends on unbundling the services to focus on travel only. Most major airlines offer 
other services such as drinks, food, lounge and conveniences of major airports, however ULCCs are only interested 
in charging passengers for going from point A to point B with no frills. Everything else is eschewed. Airfares are 
Francis Chou's Chou Europe Fund Annual 2020 Letter
substantially reduced as a result. For example, you can fly from Brussels, Belgium to Barcelona, Spain and back 
again for a total cost of less than €50. However, if you want to use the washroom while in flight, you have to pay 
one Euro for it. In spite of that, it is a terrific deal for the passengers. And they have made bundles of money doing 
that for the last 20 years. We believe the ULCC will be the first ones to recover from the COVID pandemic. 
However, there are several things they have to do, chief among them are: Passengers have to be assured about 
their personal safety from the virus. Airlines have to enhance cabin cleaning and air filtration systems and will 
require all passengers to wear masks or coverings. Steps need to be taken to leave middle seats open or restrict 
ticket sales. Initially they have to run the airlines as close as possible so as to not lose money. As time goes by and 
with the availability of vaccine, enough demand will come back to make the airlines financially viable. Meanwhile the 
government bailout will keep the ULCC afloat. The ULCC companies we have invested in have enough liquidity to 
last for a year. Below are the companies we have invested in. We bought them cheap and at the point of maximum 
pessimism. We believe that they have a bright future. [1][2][3][4] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ("FIAT") We initiated a 
position in FIAT back in late 2018 since it was a cheap stock with good amounts of cash. It caught our attention 
when the controlling shareholders wanted to unlock value either by paying special dividends, buybacks of shares or 
through strategic merger and acquisition. Since our purchase in December 2018, we have received US$2.70 in 
regular and special dividends, accounting for over 30% of the original price paid. We expect the regular and special 
dividend payments to continue once the COVID-19 crisis abates. After much anticipation, the merger between Fiat 
and Peugeot S.A. was finally completed on January 16, 2021. The new company is called Stellantis N.V. 
(NYSE:STLA[5]) ("Stellantis"). We are excited with the merger, as it is of the reasons why we initially invested in 
Fiat - capital allocation skills of the executives. We liked what the CEO of Stellantis said in a recent interview, "I 
don't know what the valuation will be, but I can tell you that we are not going to be a legacy carmaker cornered in 
legacy products We want to have a good result in 2021. We have also put a strong focus and a strong monitoring 
on the synergy plan. This is our commitment to you. We created this merger because it represents north of EUR 25 
billion of value creation through the implementation of the synergies that were presented, which represents on a run 
rate EUR 5 billion per year. So we have a very detailed plan that we follow up with a specific dedicated team that 
we call the Synergy Implementation Office. So every decision we make is facing the synergy that is expected from 
that decision, and we are continuously trying to improve and make sure that we deliver on our commitments, and 
we will." In other words, they are going to have cost savings of EUR 5 billion a year for a total of EUR 25 billion in 5 
years. The market capitalization of Stellantis is currently at EUR 46 billion, with much room for upside if some of 
those cost savings come to pass. Caution to the Investors Investors should be advised that we run a highly focused 
portfolio, frequently just three to five securities may comprise more than 50% of the assets of the Fund. In addition, 
the Fund has securities that are non-U.S. and could be subjected to geopolitical risks, which may trump or at least 
negatively influence the financial performance of the company. Also, we may enter into some derivative contracts, 
such as credit default swaps when we feel that the market conditions are right to use those instruments. Because of 
any or all of these factors, the net asset value of the Fund can be from time to time more volatile than at other 
times. However, we are not bothered by this volatility because our focus has always been, and continues to be, on 
how inexpensive we believe the Fund's portfolio holdings are relative to what we believe to be their intrinsic value. 
Also, the Fund's cash position was approximately 33.8% of net assets as at December 31, 2020. This large cash 
position may depress returns for a while as we hunt for undervalued securities. Obviously, if there is a severe 
correction in the market in the near future, it will cushion the Fund against losses while providing us with the 
wherewithal to find good investment opportunities. But for now, it could be a drag on returns. If we cannot find any 
bargains, the large cash position may stay for a long time. Other Matters FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS: 
None existed at December 31, 2020. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS: None existed at December 31, 2020. U.S. 
DOLLAR VALUATION: Any investor who wishes to purchase the Chou Funds in U.S. dollars may do so. 
REDEMPTION FEE: We have a redemption fee of 2% if unitholders redeem their units in less than 3 months. None 
of this fee goes to the Fund Manager. It is put back into the Fund for the benefit of the remaining unitholders. 
INDEPENDENT REVIEW COMMITTEE: The Manager has established an IRC as required by NI 81-107. The 
members of the IRC are Sandford Borins, Peter Gregoire and Joe Tortolano. The 2020 IRC Annual Report is 
available on our website www.choufunds.com. As of March 15, 2021, the NAVPU of a Series A unit of the Fund 
was $11.77 and the cash position was approximately 21.8% of net assets. The Fund is up 5.4% from the beginning 
of the year. In U.S. dollars, it is up 7.5%. Except for the performance numbers of the Chou Europe Fund, this letter 
contains estimates and opinions of the Fund Manager and is not intended to be a forecast of future events, a 
guarantee of future returns or investment advice. Any recommendations contained or implied herein may not be

suitable for all investors. Yours truly, Francis Chou[6] (Trades[7], Portfolio[8]) Fund Manager The alternative method 
of purchasing Chou Europe Fund in $US has been offered since September 2005. Performance for years prior to 
September 2005 is based on the $US equivalent conversion of the results of the Chou Europe Fund ($CAN). The

Apr 04, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  France's 
government deficit will deepen and public debt rise after a lingering Covid crisis smashed hopes of a rapid 
economic rebound, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday.The annual deficit, which has spiralled as 
President Emmanuel Macron's government tries to prop up the struggling economy with massive spending, is now 
expected to reach nine percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021, he told reporters.This compares to an 8.5 
percent estimate included in the government's 2021 budget plan, and a three percent deficit limit EU members must 
usually respect but have swept aside as they deal with Covid.The minister had already told Sunday paper JDD that 
economic growth was now likely to come in at 5.0 percent this year and not 6.0 percent as believed earlier.The 
government last week extended Covid restrictions to cover the entire country and said they would remain in place 
for at least a month."These measures will affect the French economy," Le Maire said.France's debt level was now 
likely to hit 118 percent of GDP this year, Le Maire told the Grand Jury LCI-RTL-Le Figaro TV programme, up from 
an earlier 115 percent estimate and around double the EU's 60-percent debt ceiling. A third Covid wave is curtailing 
the hoped-for economic rebound Photo: AFP / LOIC VENANCE  The minister called the new forecasts "exact and 
sincere".France is going through a third wave of the pandemic which has seen daily new cases surge to 40,000, 
around double their level a month ago.Le Maire also said he had reached an outline agreement with the European 
Commission allowing France to pay more aid to flagship carrier Air France which has been struggling due to Covid 
restrictions along with the rest of the world's airlines.In return, Air France would have to give up some slots at Orly, 
Paris's second-busiest airport after Charles-de-Gaulle, he said.The sums involved would be discussed with the 
carrier which was expected to vote on the deal at a board meeting Monday, Le Maire said.Rival airline Ryanair has 
lambasted French state aid for Air France, saying it distorts competition.Although the Irish airline lost its legal case 
against state aid for the French carrier, it has argued that any additional help should be made contingent on Air 
France giving up airport capacity.

Apr 04, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  The French 
government said Sunday it has reached a deal with the European Commission allowing it to inject fresh money into 
flagship airline Air France, whose finances are creaking under the impact of coronavirus restrictions.The agreement 
follows weeks of negotiations with the EU's executive, which must ensure that state aid does not give companies an 
unfair advantage."We have an outline agreement with European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager about new 
financial aid for Air France," Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on the RTL/LCI/Le Figaro political broadcast "Le 
Grand Jury".Air France, of which the French government owns 14.3 percent, will have to give up "a certain number" 
of slots at Orly, Paris's second-largest airport after Charles de Gaulle, in return for the green light from Brussels, Le 
Maire said.Air France posted a 7.1 billion euro ($8.4 billion) loss in 2020 as its business, like that of the rest of the 
world's airlines, suffered from restrictions which all but grounded global air traffic. Le Maire would not be drawn on 
the amount of new funds to be given Air France, saying this was part of discussions to be held with the airline, 
whose board needs to vote on the deal and is to meet Monday. 
Air France already received billions in state aid and needs more as the outlook remains bleak Photo: AFP / 
STEPHANE DE SAKUTIN Le Maire said the agreement with the Commission was "very good news for Air France 
and for the whole French aviation sector", adding that negotiations had been "tough".The minister declined to say 
how many slots at Orly Air France would have to give up, but said it would be fewer than the 24 that the 
Commission had initially asked for.The French government has already given "a lot of help" to Air France to 
weather the Covid crisis with an initial sum of 7.0 billion euros and would "not sign a blank cheque" this time 
around, Le Maire said."There are tens of thousands of jobs involved. Air France is strategic for our country," he 
said.But the carrier must become more competitive and continue to reduce CO2 emissions, he said."The taxpayer 
is making an effort, and Air France must also make an effort," Le Maire added. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's 
views on state aid often get a sympathetic hearing in Brussels Photo: AFP / Kenzo TRIBOUILLARD A European 
Commission spokesperson told AFP Sunday that the executive was in contact with the French government but 
could not "predict the timing or outcome of these contacts".According to EU rules, the spokesperson said, any 
government granting more than 250 million euros in aid to a company with "significant market power" had to 
propose additional measures to safeguard competition.Any fresh capital for Air France will be scrutinised not only 
by the EU, but also by the carrier's competitors which want to make sure that the playing field remains level.Rival 
airline Ryanair, whose criticism of help for legacy airlines often finds a sympathetic ear at the European 
Commission, has lambasted previous French state aid for Air France, saying it distorts competition.Ryanair has 
long railed against the support given to national champions, and is often backed by the European 
France Claims EU Green Light For More Air France Aid
Commission.Although the Irish airline lost its legal case against state aid for the French carrier -- as well as for 
Scandinavia's SAS carrier -- it has argued that any additional help should be made contingent on Air France ceding 
airport capacity.Ryanair -- Europe's biggest airline in terms of ridership -- is also seeking to undo Germany's 
massive bailout of Lufthansa in the EU courts as well as schemes in Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and 
Portugal.The Air France plan comes as France faces rising deficits and debt because of a weaker economic 
rebound than hoped.The annual deficit, which has spiralled as President Emmanuel Macron's government tries to 
prop up the struggling economy with massive spending, is now expected to reach nine percent of gross domestic 
product (GDP) in 2021, Le Maire said.This compares with an 8.5 percent estimate included in the government's 
2021 budget plan, and a three percent deficit limit that EU members must usually respect but have swept aside as 
they deal with Covid.Economic growth is now likely to come in at 5.0 percent this year and not 6.0 as projected

The FAA has certified the high-density Boeing 737 MAX 8200, which is based on the 737 MAX 8, that can seat up 
to 200 passengers in a single all-economy configuration.
The FAA certified the Boeing 737 MAX 8200 on March 31, 2021, as first<u> reported</u> by the Air Current. The 
MAX 8200 has been developed specifically for LCCs and incorporates two additional exit doors to accommodate 
the increased passenger capacity. While a typical 737 MAX 8 is certified to seat up to 189 passengers, the MAX 
8200 is now certified to accommodate up to 200.
Boeing and Ryanair launched the MAX 8200 in September 2014. "For everyone at Boeing, it is an honour to launch 
the 737 MAX 200 with Ryanair, one of the world's most successful all-Boeing operators," at the time commented 
the then-president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Ray Conner.
Recently, Ryanair has increased the total number of orders for the 737 MAX by 75 units, taking its total order book 
for the aircraft type to 210 in December 2020. The only other airline with an order for the MAX 8200 is Vietnam's 
VietJet, which ordered 100 units of the type in 2016.

Commission (EC) state bailout decisions for Nordic carriers Finnair and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) in response to 
Covid-19.
The court agreed with the EC that both decisions were in line with EU state aid rules.
Regarding SAS, the court rejected the argument that aid granted is incompatible with the internal market because it 
is intended to make good the damage suffered by only one company.
Given the pandemic's evolving nature and the fact that the quantification of the damage caused by it to SAS is 
necessarily prospective in nature, the court found the Commission had set out in "sufficiently precise terms" a 
calculation method for assessing the damage to avoid possible overcompensation.
The court also examined the EC's decisions in the light of the free provision of services and the freedom of 
establishment in markets in which SAS operates.
The court noted that Ryanair "does not demonstrate how the exclusivity of the measure is capable of discouraging it 
from establishing itself in Denmark or Sweden or providing services from either of those countries or to them".
Concerning Finnair, the Irish-based cow-cost airline argued that aid benefiting an individual company could not 
remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a member state.
The court responded that individual aid might be declared compatible with the internal market if necessary to 
remedy a "serious economic disturbance" such as the Covid-19 pandemic.
The court says Finnair's possible failure would have had serious consequences for the Finnish economy.
In that context, it was appropriate to contribute to remedying the serious disruption to the Finnish economy caused 
by the pandemic through the funding provided.
Ryanair rejected the decisions, stating: "Today's judgments set the process of liberalisation in air transport back by 
30 years by allowing Finland, Denmark and Sweden to give their national flag carriers a leg up over more efficient 
competitors, based purely on nationality."
EU court dismisses Ryanair appeals against Nordic bailouts
The carrier says it will appeal to the EU Court of Justice to overturn the decisions.
"If Europe is to emerge from this crisis with a functioning single market, airlines must be allowed to compete on a 
level playing field. Undistorted competition can weed out inefficiency and benefit consumers through low fares and 
choice. Subsidies, on the other hand, encourage inefficiency and will harm consumers for decades to come," 
Ryanair adds.
The airline previously dismissed plans by the French government to provide a further (EURO)4 billion bailout for Air 
France on the condition the French carrier relinquish slots at Paris Orly Airport.
"The 18 slots that Air France is being required to make available is nowhere near enough to allow others to offer a 
competitive challenge to Air France's dominance at Paris Charles de Gaulle and Paris Orly airports," Ryanair told 
Airfinance Journal.
"This latest tranche of State aid to Air France combined with these ineffective remedies will damage competition in 
the air transport market for decades to come," the airline continues.

Avolon has signed a lease agreement with UK start-up Flypop for "multiple" Airbus A330-300 aircraft.
The prospective low-cost, long haul carrier has been in discussions with several leasing companies over the past 
few months but notes that Avolon offered the most competitive rate and a pipeline of aircraft into 2023, Flypop says 
in a statement.
The start-up is looking to commence operations in October this year with its first A330-300, with plans to add an 
extra aircraft every six months, according to Avolon's senior vice-president marketing for EMEA Martyn Lewis.
Flypop will target secondary cities in India, including Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Pune, Goa, Cochin, and other 
South Asia cities, including Sylhet, Lahore, Islamabad, Sialkot, Colombo and Kathmandu, according to its website.
"The A330-300 aircraft will deliver everything we want to offer our Flypop passengers, especially the lowest seat 
prices to India", Flypop's chief executive officer Navdip Singh says.
Flypop's senior operations adviser Charlie Clifton, a former Ryanair director, says the company has avoided 
exposure to the Covid-19 pandemic and consequently is in a unique position to extract maximum advantage from 
the lower costs resulting from the crisis.
"The incumbents have been badly wounded after 18 months without any revenue but plenty of costs and debt," 
Clifton adds.
"Flypop's cost of entry is much lower now than it would have been pre-Covid-19. Low fares always stimulate greater 
demand. The sector is currently on the floor, but the market will return strongly," he continues.

Ryanair raises FY2021 guidance

Ryanair has adjusted its guidance for the 12 months to 31 March 2021.
The airline expects to register a net loss of between (EURO)800 million ($950 million) and (EURO)850 million, a 
slight improvement from previous guidance of (EURO)850 million to (EURO)900 million, Ryanair said in an investor 
update.
The European low-cost carrier noted that Easter travel restrictions, lockdowns and a delayed traffic recovery into 
the peak summer season this year, due to the slow rollout in the European Union of Covid-19 vaccines, meant that 
full-year 2022 traffic was also likely to be towards the lower end of its previously guided range of around 80 million 
passengers. 
Full-year group traffic was 27.5 million passengers, down from 149 million in full-year 2020 due to the Covid-19 
pandemic and travel restrictions.
"While it is not possible (at this time) to provide meaningful FY22 profit guidance, we do not share the recent 
optimism of certain analysts as we believe that the outcome for FY22 is currently close to breakeven," Ryanair 
added.
The company said its balance sheet "remains strong", with a BBB credit rating with S&P Global and Fitch Ratings.
It said it had "significant liquidity", with year-end cash of over (EURO)3.2 billion, while more than 84% of the group's 
owned fleet of 420 Boeing 737 aircraft are unencumbered.
Meanwhile, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a type certificate on 6 April to recertify the 737 Max 8200 
to resume operations in Europe.
This follows a US Federal Aviation Administration decision for the same last week.
As reported, Ryanair expects to start incorporating 737 Max aircraft in April, with eight delivered this month and 
another eight in May for a fleet of 16 in operation for summer 2021.

Ryanair expands at Aarhus in Summer '21
Irish low-cost leader Ryanair this week announced that it will open two new direct routes to southern Europe this 
summer - the Greek island of Corfu and the Dalmatian Coast gateway of Zadar, in Croatia - from the Scandinavian 
city of Aarhus
Aarhus Airport welcomed the news from its long-term partner, kick-starting the summer with two brand new routes 
from mainland Denmark - where Aarhus is the only airport to offer direct links to the so-called Greek island pearl 
and to Croatia's popular Dalmatian destination.
The airline confirmed that they are opening-up the brand new route to Corfu in Greece at the same time as the 
direct service to Zadar with both services commencing on 2nd July in time for summer and operating on both 
Mondays and Fridays, twice-weekly.  The airport's route development team welcomed the Ryanair news saying, 
"these are two very attractive destinations that mainland Danes now have direct access to from Aarhus, where 
Corfu has long been on the customer wish-list and until now, a bit awkward to get to.  A little further up the Adriatic, 
historic Zadar is tapping directly into the growing attention that Croatia has gained among Danish sunseekers, so it 
is well anticipated by Ryanair to prioritize both these two routes, covering a gap in the market and with a strong 
signal that they are investing in the vacation wishes of the Aarhus population base, which is the fifth largest in the 
Nordics", commented David Surley, director of route development at Aarhus Airport.
Flights from Aarhus to Corfu and Zadar will both fly until 29 October 2021 this summer, joining Gdansk and London 
Stansted on the Ryanair departure board, with operation on those services resuming shortly having paused due to 
pandemic-related travel restrictions.  Flights linking Ryanair's new Corfu base are 3 hours in duration, performed by 
the carrier's 189-seat Boeing 737-800 fleet, while flights from Zadar will be marketed by Ryanair and undertaken by 
the Lauda Europe operation aboard 180-seat Airbus A320 aircraft.

Ryanair Holdings has announced it will open a new base at Zagreb airport, starting on September 1, 2021, and 
operated by its Maltese unit, Lauda Europe (LW, Malta Int'l). The Irish low-cost carrier, which does not currently 
serve the Croatian capital, said it will launch the first two routes to Zagreb, from Brussels Charleroi and Milan 
Bergamo, in early June and July 2021, respectively. Both will be operated with B737-800s based at each of the 
respective airports. The carrier said the base would create 60 new jobs in Zagreb. Ryanair will be the first large-
scale low-cost holding not just to base aircraft out of Zagreb but even to serve the Croatian capital, besides 
Eurowings. Compared to Zagreb, Zadar faces far more competition from other LCCs, including easyJet, Vueling 
Airlines, Eurowings, and Transavia Airlines, the ch-aviation capacities module shows. All of them serve the city on a 
seasonal basis.

Even as the European Commission found on March 26 that EUR24.7 million euros (USD29.1 million) in Italian 
support in favour of Alitalia (AZ, Rome Fiumicino) between November 1 and December 31, 2020, was in line with 
tweaked Covid-era EU state aid rules, it took the wind out of the sails of its anointed successor ITA - Italia Trasporto 
Aereo by reportedly demanding it renounce many of its airport slots. While acknowledging that two investigations on 
loans to the Italian flag carrier, provided in 2018 and 2019, are still ongoing, EU antitrust czar Margrethe Vestager 
said that Rome could now "provide further compensation for direct damages suffered by Alitalia between November 
and December" as a result of the bloc's continuing travel restrictions. The announcement followed earlier decisions 
in September and December last year to approve Italian measures compensating the airline for damage suffered 
amid governmental restrictions between March 1 and 15 June, and June 16 to October 31, respectively. However, 
Brussels threw the wheel chocks on its talks with Rome over a restructuring plan meant to transform Alitalia into the 
leaner, nationalised ITA as the European Commission requested that it yield a significant number of its slots, the 
newspaper Il Messaggero reported. 
The Italian government considers the slots, in particular those at Milan Linate, to be a vital part of the newco's 
industrial plan and future strategy, and renouncing them would take away the lifeblood and the sustainability of the 
company's accounts, sources told the daily. Alitalia's maintenance and groundhandling units must also be sold, 
according to Brussels. Under the industrial plan, ITA should take over the brand, slots, and some assets of the 
oldco if it is to start flying with a trimmed-down fleet in time to catch the Italian carrier's important summer season. 
But EU clearance is needed for both the nationalisation and the injection of another EUR3 billion (USD3.5 billion) of 
taxpayers' money into the new carrier. Yet another postponement to the launch of ITA seriously jeopardises the fate 
of Alitalia's 11,000 employees and the fate of the newco itself, government and union sources told the newspaper. 
Alitalia currently operates 67% of the slots at Linate, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper, and Brussels 
reportedly wants to see this cut to less than 50%. Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has said it would take part in a tender, if 
one was arranged, to buy slots both there and at Rome Fiumicino. Last year, Lufthansa (LH, Frankfurt Int'l) was 
compelled to abandon 24 slots at each of its Frankfurt Int'l and Munich hubs in return for its EUR9 billion (USD10.6 
billion) bailout. Sources confirmed to Reuters that the European Commission was demanding a significant cut in the 
number of slots Alitalia would transfer to ITA. However, the European Commission has declined to comment. 
Claudio Tarlazzi, general secretary of the union UILTrasporti, and its national secretary Ivan Viglietti condemned 
the European Commission's stance in a statement on March 27, branding its conditions "unacceptable, 
inadmissible, and totally penalising for the start of the new ITA; the Italian government should go ahead alone and 
protect the national interest." "It is clear that [Vestager] is pursuing the interests of European competitors. On 
Brussels backs (EURO)25mn aid to Alitalia , blocks ITA over slots
Alitalia, she is not as impartial as she should be and is acting as an armed wing of other major and low-cost 
carriers. [...] The approach of the competition commissioner reveals a strongly discriminatory approach towards 
Italy, with rules that ensure the new Alitalia-ITA is born so weak and so mutilated that it is not able to survive let 
alone be profitable." A demonstration at Fiumicino on March 26 involving more than 3,500 people, according to the 
union, will be followed by another protest on April 14 at the Ministry of Economic Development, the UILTrasporti 
statement concluded.

K-Mile Asia (8K, Bangkok Suvarnabhumi) took delivery of its first B737-800(BCF) on March 24, 2021, ch-aviation 
research has revealed. EI-DLR (msn 33596) was ferried to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi directly after conversion at 
Jinan airport. It will become HS-KMD once re-registered in Thailand. The 14.6-year-old ex-Ryanair aircraft is owned 
by KV Aviation and is the second of twenty-one B737-800s to be converted by ASL Aviation Holdings, which holds 
a 45% stake in the airline through ASL Airlines Switzerland. ASL's first B737-800(BCF) was delivered in November 
2020 to ASL Airlines France (5O, Paris CDG). While the French carrier deploys the aircraft on behalf of FedEx, K-
Mile Air said that its -800(BCF) would operate for DHL Express, mainly on regional trunk routes connecting 
Bangkok, Hong Kong Int'l, and Hanoi. According to the ch-aviation fleets advanced module, K-Mile Air also 
operates one B737-400(F) and two B737-400(SF)s.

I s there any cuisine more maligned than that served at 38,000ft? We all know the jokes about the soggy salads 
and indeterminate meat but, secretly and a little guiltily, I have always rather adored it: the chewy, nutty little cheese 
rolls on Swiss, the chunks of real honeycomb on Turkish, Lufthansa's pretzels, Virgin's scones with clotted cream. I 
make sure I'm awake in time for the pre-arrival sausage and eggs on overnight flights. I've even enjoyed easyJet's 
mouth-scorching croque monsieurs, and in the distant past was known to dabble with Ryanair's Bullseye Baggies, 
spirit shots served in plastic bags and always two for the price of one.
Objectively the food might not rival that served in restaurants on terra firma, but there is something deeply satisfying 
about the whole performance. Waiting for the trolley to reach your row, surveying the compartmentalised tray, 
fiddling with the Lilliputian salt and pepper shakers, fussing with the hot towels - tiny sacraments that presage the 
start of an overseas adventure.
All that has, of course, been swept away in the last year and I'm not alone in missing it. For four days in October, 
Singapore Airlines offered the chance to dine on an A380 that never left the ground; tickets sold out in 30 minutes. 
Now British Airways has stepped in to offer succour to frustrated frequent flyers: a recipe box service, launching this 
weekend, which will deliver food from its first-class cabin to those grounded at home.

I tested it last week, a big cardboard box arriving on the doorstep with numerous smaller ones inside, each labelled 
with BA stickers that almost resemble luggage tags. All the packaging is recyclable or
All the packaging is recyclable or compostable and, like a real airline meal, it conveys a reassuring sense of order: 
a tiny pot contains one sprig of fresh mint in water, another has exactly three orange pieces and one raspberry, 
precisely as per the recipe.
First was a starter of Loch Fyne smoked salmon (wonderful) and honey and mustard dressing (teensy bit 
overpowering); then 48-hour slowcooked beef cheeks in a rich jus, with potato gratin, broccoli and chimichurri. 
Though you need to chop the ends off the broccoli, and slice parsley and coriander, this isn't an exercise in 
flamboyant cheffery - core parts of the meal are supplied by BA's caterers Do&Co and were designed to be 
prepared in an airborne galley. So, I discover to my relief, the 48-hour beef is actually sous vide - or, to put it more 
plainly, boil-in-the-bag - and is no less delicious for it, the richness of the beef cut through with the freshness and 
spice of the chimichurri. Next was a plate of four British cheeses, with sourdough crackers and fig chutney, then a 
hot, chocolate-studded bread and butter pudding with vanilla sauce.
It was the best thing I had eaten in months, but I wondered a bit at its purpose. For the most part, the recipe box 
trend has been about supporting local restaurants to make sure they are still there when pandemic restrictions 
ease. But BA's parent IAG lost (EURO)7.4bn last year - flogging a few DIY meals isn't going to keep its planes in 
the air. Instead, it seems this is more about that modern mantra, "engagement" - providing a treat for the airline's 
most devoted customers, a joyful reminder that one day we will be dining in the skies again.
The BA First Class recipe box costs £80 and serves two, see www.feastbox.co.uk/britishairways. It is only available 
in the UK; orders in the first week get a free bottle of Hattingley Valley English sparkling wine

Danish design throughout the airport - construction work completes ahead of time, in 2022
Aarhus Airport in Denmark will be the world's first with a VIP end-to-end experience thoughout, for all customers 
and generations.  This exclusive vibe is underlined by the airport's elegant new golden look when construction work 
completes in 2022.
The airport unveiled how its completely modernised airport will look at a press conference addressing when 
redevelopment work of approx. DKK 140 million will be completed ahead of time, in 2022. The design thread in the 
airport's terminal, which will double in size from approx. 5,000 to 10,000 m2 , will be consistently Nordic throughout, 
with sharp lines, softened by a warm and welcoming glow - more precisely a golden glow. The facade of the airport 
is being constucted in sustainable materials, metallic gold in colour and with expansive glass sections showering 
natural light into the airport's calming interior space. Despite the current standstill in air traffic, Aarhus Airport 
cements its clear long-term vision and is gearing-up to be the Greater Aarhus and East Jutland region's 
international gateway for the future.
"We continue to stick to the ambitious growth strategy we presented in 2019. The goal is 1.5 million passengers by 
2027.  Modernisation is an essential move to make the airport attractive to international airlines and increase 
aircraft movements, as well as to service a much larger number of customers. Our facilities will be top-tuned, and 
the entire guest experience is being lifted-up to that same higher league. That is of course a special situation to 
 handle and navigate, achieving turnaround during a pandemic, but we are already seeing many positive signs in 
our route development work and we have full confidence that the airport will deliver on all parameters. In fact, just 
last night, Ryanair confirmed another brand new route at Aarhus Airport, opening its first Greek service as soon as 
July ", says Nicolai Krøyer, who took over as the new CEO of Aarhus Airport on 1st March 2021.
As part of the modernisation, the airport is expanding with the addition of three new boarding gates, so that seven 
terminal-side aircraft can be handled at one time. Simultaneously, a new two-storey departure and transit lounge is 
forming, with 500 m2 of on the lower floor allocated to brand new tax-free shopping, while the first floor will feature 
smartly furnished lounge areas with panoramic windows offering an uninterrupted vista of the runway, as well as the 
new café and restaurant. In terms of design, the interior follows the sustainable Nordic theme with furniture from 
Danish design house HAY. A new airport hotel is fully-integrated within the terminal's first floor level; corridors 
facing the car park and rooms bathed with natural light. Among other things, the hotel will meet the need for 
accommodation by international business travelers on early and later timed flights - and more of them are coming - 
Going for gold: Aarhus Airport reveals bold new Nordic look
according to Mayor of Aarhus, Jacob Bundsgaard. At the same time, the mayor assesses that continually improving 
accessibility to the airport is a very important competitive parameter and vital for the city, the economy and the 
airport's further growth.
"Greater Aarhus is the Nordic region's fifth largest population base and mainland Denmark's largest growth center - 
we have a great number of international headquarters and companies as well a world-class university. They 
deserve a top-tier airport that can fully support and facilitate further business development as well as increase the 
attraction of overseas talent, skills and a growing number of international tourists. Our business travellers and 
vacationers must have ample opportunity to fly to attractive destinations, plus, it must be smooth to get to and from 
the airport. Therefore, we would like the R15 route from the city centre upgraded to motorway all the way to the 
airport, desirably also to the city of Grenaa, so we can fully embrace the development of the region. Ultimately, it is 
also relevant to identify a light-rail solution directly to Aarhus Airport ", says the mayor of Aarhus, Jacob 
Bundsgaard.
The airport is well ahead on its upgrades, which also include a six-lane ultra-efficient security screening area, 
expanded car parking areas, expanded hangarage for aircraft, new police and customs facilities, sound-proofed 
play area across two floors, a teenage lounge with soccer field, flight simulator and more. The design of the airport 
has been prepared by all Danish companies, among others AART Architects, Schmidt Hammer Lassen and AMPM 
Design Studio. In May, construction of the airport hotel begins and Aarhus Airport itself will manage the operation of 
the hotel and guest experience.
Caption: Gold has been awarded to Aarhus when the mainland Danish airport's construction works is completed in 
2022. Aarhus Airport's exterior design is in sharp Nordic style in golden tones.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has announced that it will open two entirely new bases in Greece, at Kerkyra and Rhodes 
airports, as well as reopen its Chania base, closed in 2018, as it bets on a rapid resurgence in summer leisure 
traffic. The opening of the bases will bring about a total of 46 new routes. All three bases are scheduled to open in 
July 2021 and will initially be seasonal, operating through October 2021. "Greece is proving to be a resilient 
destination and is determined to lead the way in tourism recovery as we walk away from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Following the announcement of the first travel corridors with Israel and Cyprus in April and the official re-opening to 
all international travel from May 14, we are proud to support the resurgence of the country's tourism industry and to 
offer both Greek visitors and customers greater choice and even lower fares," Ryanair's Commercial Director Jason 
McGuinness said. The Irish low-cost carrier plans to base two aircraft out of Kerkyra. It will launch eighteen new 
routes out of the airport, to: Aarhus, Copenhagen Kastrup, Düsseldorf Int'l, Münster/Osnabrück, Wroclaw, Kraków, 
Nuremberg, Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden, Milan Malpensa, Verona, Marseilles, Barcelona El Prat, Odesa, Sibiu, 
Santorini, Heraklion, Paphos, and Tel Aviv Ben Gurion. Ryanair plans to base one B737 each out of Rhodes and 
Chania. Out of the former, it will add 13 new routes to: Dublin Int'l, Birmingham Int'l, Warsaw Modlin, Memmingen, 
Venice Treviso, Suceava, Marseilles, Barcelona, Brindisi, Thessaloniki, Heraklion, Paphos, and Tel Aviv. Out of the 
latter, it will launch 15 new services, to: Newcastle, GB, Leeds/Bradford, Billund, Bremen Hans Koschnick, Berlin 
Brandenburg Int'l, Cologne/Bonn, Kyiv Boryspil, Budapest, Venice Treviso, Bologna, Rome Ciampino, Bari, 
Mykonos, Malta Int'l, and Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said during a 
press conference that the carrier hopes to start taking its first B737-8-200s in April 2021. The type has yet to be 
certified and although Ryanair initially hoped that it would happen by the end of March, this timeline is no longer 
feasible. O'Leary said that he expected FAA and EASA certifications within the first days of April, which would then 
pave the way for the delivery of the first eight units in April and another eight in May 2021.

Ryanair is banking on the return of summer holidays as the low-cost European airline plans to ramp up its flight 
schedule to 80 per cent of pre-pandemic levels from the middle of June.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary was upbeat on vaccine rollouts in the UK and EU helping to kickstart international 
travel this summer, after falls in European airline stocks this week fuelled by doubts about overseas vacations.
"We are very confident at this point in time that, given the success of firstly the UK vaccine rollout programme and 
subsequently a European catch-up programme, that by June or mid-June, July, August, families will be travelling to 
and from the UK," he said.
Despite the uncertainty around summer travel, the carrier said it planned to add 26 routes to its expanded UK 
summer schedule of flights to include locations in France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal.
Ryanair's route expansion is a stark contrast to its more hesitant rivals. British Airways, for example, has cut the 
frequency of some flights over the summer as part of continuing management of its schedule.
"We are sorry that, like other airlines, due to the current coronavirus pandemic and global travel restrictions, we are 
operating a reduced and dynamic schedule," BA said.
Ryanair's service is expected to run at about 50 per cent of normal levels until June, when it will increase to 80 per 
cent, reflecting the fact that tough coronavirus restrictions might remain in place in the UK and across Europe.

When asked about potential passenger volumes, O'Leary said the airline could reach 85 per cent to 90 per cent of 
normal levels in the later summer months.
His bullish comments fly in the face of the cautious approach to reopening borders adopted by the UK government, 
with social care minister Helen Whately warning people against booking summer holidays.
The government set out a road map to reopen travel by mid-May at the earliest, which has helped trigger an uptick 
in bookings for carriers from a very depressed base.

Mar 25, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] announced an expanded U.K. summer 2021 schedule despite concerns over rising coronavirus cases in 
many European countries. The airline attributed this decision to the successful vaccine rollout program in the U.K., 
based on which it expects government to allow travel during the summers.Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, stated, 
'The U.K. government has implemented a very successful vaccine rollout program, and is on track for a re-opening 
of EU short-haul travel this summer.' O'Leary told Sky News[2] that he anticipates countries across Europe, 
including the UK, to stop "locking people down" from June despite media "hysteria" over whether travel will be 
allowed during the summer holidays.As part of the expanded schedule, Ryanair will operate more than 2,300 
weekly flights across 480 routes. The airline will add 26 new routes to popular holiday destinations in France, 
Greece, 
Italy, 
Portugal 
and 
Spain.

https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/fundamental/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-fundamental/priceRyanair 
Holdings PLC price[3] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[4]The announcement comes close on the heels of a new 
coronavirus law which states that anyone who leaves England to travel out of the country without a reasonable 
reason (such as work, medical or compassionate grounds, and attending weddings and funerals) will be fined 5,000 
pounds. 
The new law, set to go into effect next week, could last until the end of June.Under the government's lockdown-
easing roadmap, foreign travel was expected to potentially resume from May 17 onward. However, prime minister 
Boris Johnson's recent warning that the U.K. could soon be hit with a third wave of coronavirus, makes the timing of 
the resumption of international travel blurry.Meanwhile, Johnson said that international leisure travel restrictions will 
only be eased after a review in April. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some

Ryanair to fly at 80% capacity over summer holidays after UK vaccine roll-out
Ryanair to fly at 80% capacity over summer holidays after UK vaccine roll-
out

Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) is to fly 80% of its schedule over the summer holiday period due to the success of the UK 
vaccination programme, chief executive Michael O'Leary said today.
The Ireland-based airline said it had seen a surge in bookings from Germany and the UK for the summer and 
especially during July, August and September.
"I think it is very difficult to persuade the UK population to sit at home, or holiday at home when everybody's been 
vaccinated," he said in an interview.
O'Leary also said that people who don't want to fly on a 737-Max will be able to wait until a flight that isn't one of the 
Boeing planes.
Ryanair is one of the biggest advocates of the troubled aircraft, which has just been allowed to fly again after being 
grounded for almost 24 months after two fatal crashes.
The airline boss said he expects to receive 16 737-Maxes by the summer, compared to an original forecast of 24 
given in February, with eight to arrive in each of April and in May but none now in June.
O'Leary's optimism over summer flights is in contrast with the UK government, which has been attempting to rein 
back travel hopes on fears that the third wave of coronavirus infections spreading across Europe might be brought 
back to the UK.
Ryanair to fly at 80% capacity over summer holidays after UK vaccine roll-out
A clampdown on attempting to travel on holiday ahead of the roadmap to recovery timetable was announced 
yesterday by the UK authorities with fines of £5,000 for anyone caught leaving the country without a reasonable 
excuse.
British Airways cancelled hundreds of flights scheduled for this summer following the fine announcement and fears 
that many more countries will be placed on the travel red-list due to the third wave of infections.
Boris Johnson's recovery road map envisages air travel resuming on May 17 and despite the caution from the UK 
authorities, Michael O'Leary said he was still optimistic.
He said he rated at above 50% that holidays would happen, especially in places such as Greece, Spain and 
Portugal that have said they would welcome people who can prove they had been vaccinated.
An announcement on travel is expected by the UK's global travel taskforce on 5 April.
Shares in Ryanair rose 3.8% to (EURO)16.16 while British Airways owner IAG added 2.6% to 192.2p.

Mar 24, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-frills 
airline Ryanair on Wednesday expressed optimism over the summer holiday outlook despite a third coronavirus 
wave sweeping Europe.Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the carrier expects to run 80 percent of capacity for 
July, August and September."Families will be travelling to and from the UK, to and from Europe, going to the 
beaches of Europe on summer holidays that are richly deserved after the very fraught last 12 months," O'Leary told 
an online press conference."I'm pleased to report that we've had a recent surge in bookings, as the UK began to 
open up restrictions."It comes despite some European nations reimposing lockdowns, including in France and 
Germany, with cases on the rise once again.O'Leary did note that there was still "a lot of uncertainty" regarding 
travel demand in April, May and June, with half the normal traffic forecast.But he expressed hope that overall 
European holiday flight demand would pick up as more nations emulate Britain's rapid inoculation drive. Ryanair 
has warned of a record annual net loss of almost 1.0 billion euros ($1.2 billion) for its financial year to March, as the 
pandemic ravages demand for air travel Photo: AFP / Adrian DENNIS  "It is very likely as the Europeans catch up 
with the UK's vaccine rollout success that we will see pent-up demand," O'Leary added.In the UK, Ryanair's biggest 
markets, transport minister Grant Shapps has said it is "too early to say" when foreign travel would be possible 
again.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's phased plan to exit England's lockdown does not anticipate a return to 
international air travel until May 17 at the earliest.Ryanair has meanwhile warned of a record annual net loss of 
almost 1.0 billion euros ($1.2 billion) for its financial year to March, as the pandemic ravages demand for air 
travel.O'Leary on Wednesday said the group remains in good shape, after slashing jobs and costs in order to 
navigate fallout from the health crisis."We could service a second lost summer should the travel restrictions remain 
in place," he added."We have the balance sheet and the cash flow to be able to do that."The Dublin-based 
company will publish annual results in May.

Ryanair vowed on Wednesday to return to a near-normal summer schedule this year by flying 2,300 flights a week 
from Britain to Europe.
The Irish discount airline said it will be running the flights across 480 routes and is also launching 26 new routes, 
including from London to the Greek islands of Santorini and Zakynthos, this summer.
The schedule means that Ryanair would be running at about 80 per cent of its usual capacity.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said that, because of the government's successful vaccine roll-out, Britain is "on 
track" for a reopening of European short-haul flights.
He also said passengers may be asked to wear face masks on Ryanair flights until 2022.
"I would imagine at this point in time, we're planning to continue to require mandatory face mask-wearing on board 
our aircraft through the remainder of this summer schedule and next winter's schedule," he said.
But while Britons may be keen to book a summer getaway, the British prime minister has been more cautious.
Boris Johnson has repeatedly been cagey regarding whether or not people should book overseas holidays, stating 
it is "too early" to tell.
In a briefing to journalists on Tuesday, he said "things certainly look difficult for the time being" and added that more 
detail would be revealed on April 5 - the next review date of whether England can lift restrictions as planned.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary expects European nations to ease their respective 
COVID-19 lockdown measures by June and allow traveling during the summer holidays, Sky News reported 
Wednesday.
The assumption comes as the airline launched a summer schedule for the UK including 26 new routes on the back 
of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout program and increased bookings following a rise in demand for trips abroad.
The government's global travel task force is expected to recommend the resumption of foreign travel on April 5 with 
the expected May 17 vaccine-led approval to have taken a back seat.
The company's shares rose about 3% on Wednesday midday.

being imposed across major European countries. Moreover, investors also became concerned about the cost of the 
government's infrastructure spending and potential tax hikes. All the three major stock indexes ended the day in 
red.

Financial Services Committee, defended developing plans for raising taxes in the future for funding new public 
investments. Economic Data The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development jointly reported that the sales of new single-family houses in February 2021 decreased 18.2% to a

Volotea (V7, Asturias) has announced it will open a seasonal summer-only base in northern Sardinia, basing a 
single A319-100 out of Olbia airport starting on June 4, 2021. "We confirm again that Sardinia is one of the most 
important regions in our development strategy and we are really happy to announce the opening of our new 
summer base in Olbia: with this important investment we want to support the local economy and contribute to the 
restart of tourism," President Carlos Muñoz said. The Spanish low-cost carrier will add two new domestic routes, to 
Cuneo and Catania, once the base opens. Volotea already has 17 routes planned from Olbia, although none of 
them are currently active. 
The first six domestic routes are expected to restart on April 1, the ch-aviation schedules module shows, while 
international flights to Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Marseilles, and Nantes are due to gradually resume in the second half 
of April. Although exact market shares are fluid due to the high number of seasonal routes, the ch-aviation 
capacities module shows that, based on current schedules, Volotea will have a 21.1% market share at Olbia by 
capacity between June 1 and August 31, 2021. It will trail behind easyJet Europe/easyJet (29.1%) but will overtake 
Alitalia (15.5%). Olbia was an Air Italy (IG, Milan Malpensa) legacy base and also served as its corporate 
headquarters dating back to its birth as Meridiana fly/Alisarda. The airport has struggled to attract new airline bases 
since Air Italy's collapse in February last year. Ryanair did toy with the idea in the wake of Air Italy's demise but 
these plans never materialised.

Shares in European airlines and other travel companies fell yesterday, as rising coronavirus cases on the continent 
accelerated doubts over the summer holiday season.
Holiday airline Jet2 fell 6 per cent, easyJet and British Airways owner IAG dropped 5 per cent, while low-cost carrier 
Ryanair slipped 2 per cent in London after recovering from steeper losses at the open.
The falls followed warnings from the UK government that a new wave of cases and lockdowns across large parts of 
continental Europe mean it is too early to book summer holidays, threatening a key source of revenue for the 
region's battered carriers.
Social care minister Helen Whately yesterday said she would advise people not to book summer holidays yet, 
because of the situation in Europe and the risk of new variants of Covid-19.
"I would say to people, just hold off," she told the BBC.
Whateley's comments came after Mike Tildesley, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza 
Group on Modelling, told the BBC over the weekend that international travel was unlikely this summer for the 
"average holiday-maker" because of the risk of introducing new coronavirus variants to the UK. "Paris lockdown, 
Carriers' shares slide as summer travel hopes fade Airlines Sector will need to raise more cash if season is a 
write-off, warn analysts
Italy's national restrictions and rising concern in Germany over infection rates ... are being reflected in growing fears 
that a second summer of travel will be lost," said Mark Wallace, an airlines analyst at Goodbody.
Carriers have reported surging bookings, albeit off a very low base, since the government set out a road map to 
reopening travel by mid-May at the earliest. But that timeframe is now in doubt, and while airlines have built up a 
wall of cash to see them through the crisis, analysts expect more big European carriers will need new cash if this 
summer is a write-off.
"The next few weeks will determine when travel can hope to resume safely," said Daniel Roeska, an airlines analyst 
at Bernstein.
"We would argue that we will see a steady improvement throughout the year. While there can be individual weeks 
of increased demand, we would caution expectations against being too exuberant for summer," he said.
Airline stocks had rallied strongly this year as investors bet the sector would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of 
the reopening of major economies.
Some companies have taken advantage of the investor enthusiasm to beef up their finances against a delay in 
borders reopening.
IAG raised (EURO)1.2bn in a bond issue last week, which it said would help it survive a prolonged downturn in 
travel.
The yield on IAG's (EURO)500m bond set to mature in 2023 rose from 2.1 per cent on Friday to 2.3 per cent 
yesterday morning while the yield on easyJet's (EURO)500m 2023 bond jumped from 0.8 to 0.97 per cent as some 
investors sold their exposure to the airlines. The yield on Ryanair's (EURO)850m bond set to mature in June rose 
from 0.3 to 0.5 per cent.

March 22, 2021 at 6:29 a.m. ET  First Published: March 22, 2021 at 5:04 a.m. ET Turkish President Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan fired central bank governor Naci Agbal on Saturday.  Adem Altan/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images   
Turkey's currency and stocks collapsed after the abrupt termination of its central bank head, a move that led 
investors to take a cautious stance toward risky assets on Monday. The dollar USDTRY, +9.79%[1] rose by as 
much as 15% vs the Turkish lira, and the BIST-100 stock-market index XU100, -9.52%[2] traded 8% lower after 
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's decision to replace Governor Naci Agbal with Sahap Kavcioglu — the third 
change at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) in two years. 
Turkey's central bank last week hiked interest rates by 2 percentage points to 19%, a full percentage point more 
than expected.'With Naci Agbal's removal from the CBRT, Turkey loses one of its last remaining anchors of 
institutional credibility,' said Phoenix Kalen, a strategist at French bank Societe Generale. 'During his short tenure, 
Agbal had succeeded where various predecessors had not - in cultivating trust in the central bank's inflation-
targeting framework, in restoring monetary policy independence, in encouraging international investors to re-
engage with the crisis-prone Turkish narrative, in driving an 18.0% rally in the lira against the dollar, and most 
crucially - in arresting and even reversing the damaging trend of dollarization in the economy.' The moves in Turkey 
sent traders into safe-haven currencies such as the dollar DXY, -0.12%[3] and the Japanese yen USDJPY, -
0.07%[4], and away from emerging-market currencies including the Mexican peso USDMXN, +0.80%[5], the South 
African rand USDZAR, -0.01%[6] and the Russian ruble USDRUB, +0.52%[7].  BBVA BBVA, -6.33%[8], which 
owns just under half of Turkey's Garanti BBVA, tumbled 7% in Madrid. That caution spread to stocks, where the 
Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.06%[9] and U.S. stock futures ES00, +0.18%[10] were fractionally higher. Airline 
stocks including International Airlines Group IAG, -4.43%[11], easyJet EZJ, -5.04%[12] and Ryanair RYA, -
3.49%[13] skidded after scientific advisors were reportedly urging U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to lift a ban 
on foreign holidays. That comes as the European Union has struggled in its vaccination campaign and is now 
considering blocking exports of AstraZeneca-made vaccines to the U.K. Shares of AstraZeneca AZN, +1.94%[14], 
which separately reported that its vaccine, made with Oxford University, was 79% effective in preventing COVID-19 
and 100% effective in preventing severe disease in a U.S. trial, rose 1.1%. Volkswagen VOW3, +6.43%[15] and its 
Europe Markets: Lira and Turkish stocks collapse after Erdogan fires central bank chief, as other emerging 
market currencies struggle
majority owner Porsche Automobil Holding PAH3, +7.44%[16] both advanced, continuing their stellar run since VW 
laid out its electric vehicle and battery plans. Analysts at Deutsche Bank hiked its price target on VW by 46% and 
on Porsche by 38%. 'With the global roll-out of the ID.4 we see a good chance that VW could surpass Tesla's 
TSLA, +0.26%[17] [battery electric vehicle] sales as soon as next year, which should increase the credit given to its 
EV strategy,' said the analysts. The post Europe Markets: Lira and Turkish stocks collapse after Erdogan fires

and aviation businesses including the British Airways owner, IAG, easyJet and the engine maker Rolls-Royce 
tumbled in early trading after the government warned the public not to book holidays abroad this summer.Investors 
took fright at the thought that the struggling airline and travel sectors could face another summer of lost bookings, 
as continental Europe struggles with the rollout of vaccine programmes. 
Shares in IAG, easyJet, Ryanair, the package holiday company Tui and the Jet2 airline fell as much as 7% in early 
trading on Monday. Rolls-Royce dipped by 3%. The negative outlook wiped off some of the strong gains made at 
travel-related businesses since the government announced its 'cautious but irreversible' roadmap out of lockdown 
on 22 February. While pandemic restrictions mean overseas holidays are banned, under Boris Johnson's roadmap 
the government had previously said they could resume as soon as 17 May. However, after warnings over the 
weekend from scientific experts that allowing summer holidays could risk another lockdown, ministers struck a more 
cautious tone in Monday morning broadcast interviews, prompting the airline and travel sector sell-off. 'My advice 
would be to anybody right now is just to hold off on booking international travel,' the social care minister, Helen 
Whately, told the BBC. 'It just feels premature to be booking international holidays at the moment.' Last week, the 
UK hit the milestone of half of all adults having received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, much 
of Europe is still struggling to get to grips with the pandemic, hampered by the slow rollout of vaccine programmes, 
rising infection rates and the impact of new variants. Mark Manduca, an airlines analyst at Citigroup, said he 
detected a 'heightened level of fatigue amongst fundamental investors' whose recovery hopes had propelled a 
recent rebound in airline stocks. 'The upside momentum-driven express train of all things recovery is now beginning 
to peter out and falter,' he said. Read more: Travel shares slide as Britons warned not to book foreign holidays[1] [

The biggest airlines have built up a net debt mountain of $320bn, a sign that the pandemic will hamper recovery for 
years as carriers face large bills from rescue financing and state support.
With hopes of a limited summer restart to travel, attention is turning to how fast airlines can heal balance sheets. 
"Liquidity is and has been of great importance," said easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren.
Although groups are sitting on cash and short-term investments of $140bn, up from $90bn at the start of the year, 
their net debt has risen $60bn over the same time to $320bn, according to FT analysis.
United, American, Delta and Southwest have led in raising cash, bolstered by more than $60bn of government aid. 
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have been shored up by billions of euros in state support. IAG tapped investors for 
(EURO)2.7bn, received a £2bn state-backed UK loan, and raised (EURO)1.2bn in a bond issue this week. Airlines 
raised $42.6bn in the debt markets in 2020, the most on record, according to data provider Dealogic.
The International Air Transport Association has said carriers could burn through $95bn of cash in 2021, and warned 
its forecast that the industry could turn cash-positive by year-end might prove optimistic.
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said airlines with the highest debt would have to reduce their balance sheet 
"scars" before they became attractive again for investors. Philip Georgiadis and Patrick Mathurin.

AirAsia Group has raised a total of MYR336.46 million ringgit (USD81.83 million) following the completion of the 
second tranche of a private share placement, which issued an additional 100,367,362 new ordinary shares, 
representing 3% of the company's total issued shares, the group said in a statement on March 17. It follows the 
initial tranche of 11.07%, or 369.85 million shares, issued on February 19. Overall, this means that the AirAsia (AK, 
Kuala Lumpur Int'l) parent issued 470.21 million new shares, representing 14.07% of its total issued shares. Stanley 
Choi Chiu Fai, a Hong Kong-based entrepreneur and professional poker player, participated in the share issue, 
raising his stake to 8.96%, bourse filings showed. However, he chose not to raise his stake in the second tranche 
noticeably. 
David Bonderman, founder and chairman of TPG Capital, a San Francisco-based investment firm, chairman of 
Ryanair for over 20 years until summer 2020, was among the other "key investors that anchored the private 
placement exercise" alongside several fellow TPG executives, investing in a personal capacity, according to the 
AirAsia Group statement. Montreal-based investment firm Aimia Inc and other local and international institutions 
also invested, but the group did not reveal the size of their investments. Aimia also holds a 48.9% stake in PLM 
Premier, the owner of Club Premier, the loyalty firm in Mexico that operates the Aeroméxico frequent flyer 
programme. "This placement forms a significant part of our overall fundraising exercise to ensure liquidity 
throughout 2021. Of the total gross proceeds, AirAsia will allocate funds to support fuel hedging settlements, 
general working expenses, and aircraft lease and maintenance payments, and fund airasia digital business units, 
namely the airasia super app and BigPay fintech platforms," group chief executive Tony Fernandes said. "On a 
wider scale, the private placement is a major vote of confidence towards the recovery of the aviation and tourism 
industries that have been severely battered by the Covid-19 pandemic," he added. As previously reported, the 
company has said it plans to raise up to MYR2.5 billion (USD608 million) through debt and equity measures. In 
related news, the High Court of Malaysia granted AirAsia X (D7, Kuala Lumpur Int'l) a restraining order for three 
months on 15 of its creditors, to assist it with its ongoing restructuring. The order, which the airline applied for, gives 
the creditors a chance to engage in amicable discussions without "extraneous considerations," according to a 
March 17 exchange filing. AirAsia X proposed to its creditors in October 2020 to restructure MYR63.5 billion 
(USD15.2 billion) in liabilities, cutting shareholder capital at the airline by about 90%.

The low-cost long-haul model of Norwegian struggled to take offNorwegian's long-haul struggles stemmed far 
before the pandemic. Now, only 36% of travellers are willing to travel outside of their continent, according to a live 
Verdict community survey. Using a model which rarely works elsewhere in the world, Norse Atlantic Airways is 
following in the footsteps of Norwegian, with a carbon copy of a failed business model. Low-cost operations depend 
on destinations in close proximity to each other (4-hour flight maximum), the ability to utilize smaller airports and 
being able to operate smaller aircraft. 
This helps an airline to keep costs and fares low and it is why it works so well for European low-cost carriers 
easyJet and Ryanair. Full-service carriers are now incorporating low-cost options to their offerings, which will 
adhere to travellers' new Covid-19 impacted budgets. Components such as hand-luggage only fares and seat 
selection only available a day before the flight will allow fares to be reduced and allow full-service carriers to 
compete with low-cost carriers. These lower fares will attract low-cost customers who may not have considered a 
full-service carrier and could be enticed by the improved level of service and loyalty programmes available. The 
business model needs to change to succeedThe signs are there that this new venture could not work.  As Norse 
Atlantic Airways plans to fly the same aircraft, operate from the same airports and probably hire the same, recently 
redundant staff, this new airline is almost a copy of Norwegian. Norwegian CEO and founder Bjørn Tore Larsen is 
also a 15% shareholder in the new venture. He has confidence in this opportunity, where he believes there will be a 
need for an innovative low-cost long-haul carrier in the continental market. However, following the same path could 
lead to failure. Norse Atlantic Airways must look at Norwegian's wrongdoings and change to be successful. One 
avenue that could be changed is the lack of business and first-class cabins. Premium classes often make full-
service flights profitable. The introduction of a new business class cabin that is able to charge more and make more 
of a profit on seats could be a lucrative idea. JetBlue has recently announced that it is expanding operations on a 
transatlantic scale, taking its existing low-cost model long-haul. To stand out from its competitors, it introduced a 
New low-cost long-haul airline to be aware of Norwegian 's mistakes
new MINT-class cabin, giving a refreshing take on premium travel experiences and attracting higher-spending 
customers. Business-class passengers may historically shy away from low-cost airlines for premium or business 
trips. Recent budget cuts in all sectors due to the pandemic could leave an opportunity for low-cost offerings to 
prosper. A new long-haul low-cost airline does not suit the current marketConsumer confidence is at an all-time low 
due to the pandemic. Flexibility is key to gaining trust from travellers and increasing cash flow. Booking with an 
operator that is a new entrant into the market and following the footsteps of a fallen airline may not create a great 
deal of confidence for travellers. They are likely to be brand loyal, and book with well-known, flexible operators with 
contingency plans and protection if flights are cancelled or the airline falls into administration. Long-haul travel is 
also low on the priority list in the near future for travellers. Domestic travel is expected to boom in the short-to-
medium term. This and many others create doubt surrounding the future success of Norse Atlantic Airways. 
Norwegian finally ceased its long-haul operations in January 2021, which was well anticipated after reporting losses 
long before the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, Norse Atlantic Airways plans to follow in Norwegian's footsteps as a new 
Norway-based airline and serve Europe-to-US routes.

These stocks have strong business predictability ratingsIn observance of St. Patrick's Day, when everyone is Irish 
for a day, investors may be interested in companies headquartered on the Emerald Isle. According to the National 
Retail Federation[1], American consumers will spend an average of $40.77 per person this year celebrating 
Ireland's favorite holiday. While the bulk of the total $5.1 billion will be spent on food and drinks, 30% of those 
surveyed said they will purchase green clothing so as to avoid being pinched. The GuruFocus All-in-One 
Screener[2] found some Irish companies with strong business predictability ratings as of March 17 included CRH 
PLC (NYSE:CRH[3]), Irish Continental Group PLC (LSE:ICGC[4]), Kingspan Group PLC (LSE:KGP[5]) and Ryanair 
Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY[6]). CRH CRH (NYSE:CRH[7]) has a $37.03 billion market cap; its shares were 
trading around $46.77 on Wednesday with a price-earnings ratio of 30.84, a price-book ratio of 1.79 and a price-
sales ratio of 1.25. The GF Values chart shows the stock is modestly overvalued currently based on historical 
ratios, past performance and future earnings projections. https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/CRH/summary 
GuruFocus rated the Dublin-based building materials company's financial strength 5 out of 10. Although the 
company has issued approximately $1.8 billion in new long-term debt over the past three years, it is at a 
manageable level due to sufficient interest coverage. The Altman Z-Score of 2.21, however, indicates the company 
is under some pressure since assets are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing. CRH's profitability 
scored a 6 out of 10 rating, driven by an expanding operating margin and returns that outperform around half of its 
industry peers. The company also has a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 6, indicating business conditions are stable, 
but due to revenue per share declining over the past 12 months, the one-star predictability rank is on watch. 
According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return an average of 1.1% annually over a 10-year period. Of the 
gurus invested in CRH, Jim Simons[8] (Trades[9], Portfolio[10])' Renaissance Technologies has the largest stake 
with 0.15% of outstanding shares. Jeremy Grantham[11] (Trades[12], Portfolio[13]), Charles Brandes[14] 
(Trades[15], Portfolio[16]), Lee Ainslie[17] (Trades[18], Portfolio[19]) and First Eagle Investment[20] (Trades[21], 
Portfolio[22]) also own the stock. Irish Continental Group Irish Continental Group (LSE:ICGC[23]) has a market cap 
of 679.43 million pounds ($944.5 million); its shares were closed at 3.70 pounds on Tuesday with a price-book ratio 
of 2.85 and a price-sales ratio of 2.74. According to the GF Value Line, the stock is fairly valued currently. 
4 Lucky Irish Companies to Consider for St. Patrick's Day
https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/LSE:ICGC/summary The shipping and transport company, which services routes 
between Ireland, the U.K. and Continental Europe, was given a profitability rank of 5 out of 10 by GuruFocus. Due 
to issuing approximately 151.3 billion euros ($180.08 billion) in new long-term debt over the past three years, Irish 
Continental has poor interest coverage. Additionally, the Altman Z-Score of 2.63 indicates it is under some pressure 
as the return on invested capital is eclipsed by the weighted average cost of capital, indicating issues with creating 
value. Irish Continental's profitability fared better, scoring a 7 out of 10 even though the operating margin is in 
decline and returns are underperforming a majority of industry peers. The company also has a moderate Piotroski 
F-Score of 5, but the one-star predictability rank is on watch as a result of revenue per share declining over the past 
several years. No gurus currently own the stock. Kingspan Group Kingspan Group (LSE:KGP[24]) has a market cap 
of 12.63 billion pounds; its shares closed at 69.35 pounds on Tuesday with a price-earnings ratio of 34.25, a price-
book ratio of 5.46 and a price-sales ratio of 2.8. Based on the GF Value Line, the stock appears to be significantly 
overvalued currently. https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/LSE:KGP/summary GuruFocus rated the Irish building 
materials company's financial strength 6 out of 10. Although the company has issued approximately 926.3 million 
euros in new long-term debt over the past three years, it is still at a manageable level due to having adequate 
interest coverage. The robust Altman Z-Score of 4.77 indicates Kingspan is in good standing even though revenue 
per share had been in decline for the past year. The ROIC also surpasses the WACC, indicating good value 
creation. Kingspan's profitability scored an 8 out of 10 rating, driven by an expanding operating margin, strong 
returns that outperform a majority of competitors and a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 5. It also has a five-star 
predictability rank. GuruFocus says companies with this rank return an average of 12.1% annually. No gurus 
currently own the stock. Ryanair Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[25]) has a $25.72 billion market cap; its shares were 
trading around $115.05 on Wednesday with a price-book ratio of 4.07 and a price-sales ratio of 6.86. The GF Value 
Line suggests the stock is currently significantly overvalued. https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/RYAAY/summary 
The Irish low-cost airline's financial strength was rated 4 out of 10 by GuruFocus. While the company's cash-to-debt 
ratio is outperforming versus other industry players, its Altman Z-Score of 1.66 suggests it is under some pressure. 
The company's profitability fared better with an 8 out of 10 rating. In addition to a declining operating margin, 
Ryanair has negative returns that underperform a majority of industry peers and a low Piotroski F-Score of 2, which 
indicates business conditions are in poor shape. As a result of recording a slowdown in revenue growth, the three-
star predictability rank is on watch. GuruFocus data shows companies with this rank see their stocks gain an 
average of 8.2% per year. With a 4.65% stake, Baillie Gifford[26] (Trades[27], Portfolio[28]) is Ryanair's largest guru 
shareholder. Other top guru investors are Sarah Ketterer[29] (Trades[30], Portfolio[31]), David Herro[32] 
(Trades[33], Portfolio[34]), Simons' firm, the Causeway International Value[35] (Trades[36], Portfolio[37]) Fund, 
PRIMECAP Management[38] (Trades[39], Portfolio[40]), Glenn Greenberg[41] (Trades[42], Portfolio[43]), Julian 
Robertson[44] (Trades[45], Portfolio[46]), Alan Fournier[47] (Trades[48], Portfolio[49]), Pioneer Investments[50] 
(Trades[51], Portfolio[52]) and Francis Chou[53] (Trades[54], Portfolio[55]). Disclosure: No positions. Read more
