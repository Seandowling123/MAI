CONSUMER champion Which? yesterday reported Easyjet to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for allegedly 
mistreating passengers over the last weeks of travel chaos.
Which? accused the low-cost airline of keeping travellers in the dark about their right to either be booked on another 
company's flight or claim compensation.
"A major overhaul is desperately needed, so the government must give the CAA stronger powers so it can hit 
operators with heavy fines when necessary," said Which?'s travel editor Rory Boland.
The decision comes a week after the consumer champion accused the likes of Ryanair, British Airways and TUI of 
breaking consumer law by either "blacklisting" passengers or adopting misleading language on refund policies.
Easyjet said: "We clearly inform customers that if there are no Easyjet alternative flights within 24 hours, they can 
book flights via an alternative carrier and we'll reimburse them in full or they can choose a full refund."

Jul 08, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] announced its plans to restart operating flights from the Belfast International Airport. 
The European carrier will be resuming operations with 12 new routes from next summer, operating 115 flights per 
week. The routes include Alicante, Faro, Barcelona Girona, Milan Bergamo and Malaga, coupled with domestic 
services to East Midlands, Edinburgh, London Stansted and Manchester. 
Ryanair's Belfast-based fleet will include two aircraft, generating 60 aviation jobs apart from creating multiple other 
indirect vacancies at Belfast International. The move also increases the number of destinations available from the 
airport to more than 70 domestic and international ones. As a result, passengers will get more traveling choices. 
Further, George Best Belfast City Airport has announced new services to Cardiff and Southampton with Aer Lingus 
Regional, operated by Emerald Airlines. Michelle Hatfield, Corporate Services director at Belfast City Airport, said: 
'As one of the largest airline partners at Belfast City Airport, the addition of more Aer Lingus Regional services is 
fantastic for both business and leisure passengers wishing to travel to the UK." 
Per Ryanair's Management, reduced aviation taxes and competitive airport charges have encouraged them in their 
latest move to launch close to 80 weekly domestic flights to/from East Midlands, Edinburgh, London Stansted and 
Manchester. Notably, declining aviation taxes boost traffic growth and increase connectivity. 
The latest move reflects Ryanair's growth-oriented plans over the upcoming years and should boost traffic at the 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) European carrier. Notably, shares of RYAAY have lost 33.4% year to date compared with 
23.8% loss of the industry[2] it belongs to.

Jul 08, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 With labor problems hurting the U.S. airline industry, there was an encouraging update from American Airlines' 
AAL[1] CEO Robert Isom. Per the new proposal made to the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing the 
pilots, pilot pay is likely to be boosted 17% by 2024 end. European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] also 
received impressive tidings on the labor front when it reached a pay-related agreement with the British Airline Pilots' 
Association (BALPA). 
Latin American carrier Gol Linhas' GOL[3] June traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometers declined 5.5% 
from the May reading, reflecting the slowdown in air-travel demand in the country. In the latest update on the 
takeover saga of Spirit Airlines SAVE[4], management delayed its shareholders' vote on the buyout offer put 
forward by Frontier Group Holdings ULCC[5] by a week to Jul 15. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.Per the 
proposal put forward by AAL's CEO, pilots will be eligible for a pay hike of 6% on commencement of the contract 
followed by 5% raises at the start of 2023 and 2024. Moreover, if the deal gets ratified by Sep 30, 2022, there will 
be other lucrative incentives like retroactive pay. The new offer[6] is being reviewed by the union. American Airlines 
currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Updates on labor deals at other U.S.-based carriers were mentioned in 
the previous week's writeup[7]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. At Ryanair, the labor deal will accelerate pay restoration of pilots and ensure pay hikes post restoration through 
2026. The restoration of pay is necessary as RYAAY intends to expand capacity as much as 115% of the pre-
coronavirus levels in the current year itself to meet the demand swell. 
Per Ryanair's people director Darrell Hughes, 'While 100% of our pilots across our European network are covered 
by 2020 Emergency Agreements, we continue to work with our pilots and their unions on new deals, similar to this 
one concluded with BALPA, and have successfully re-negotiated improved long-term agreements with 70% of our 
pilots, running until 2026 or 2027 as we prioritize pay restoration.' Naturally, for this capacity expansion, it is 
imperative to keep RYAAY's group of pilots satisfied. The pay increments apart, pilots at RYAAY become eligible 
for other benefits[9]. 
3. At Gol Linhas, consolidated capacity (measured in available seat kilometers) expanded 68.6% year over year in 
June, much higher than the traffic increase of 54%. As a result of capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth, 
Airline Stock Roundup: Pay Hike Likely for AAL Pilots, GOL's June Traffic & More
load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 7.2 percentage points to 76.7%. The domestic operations 
accounted for most of the data as international operations are still minimal. 
In the first half of the year, consolidated load factor decreased 2.5 percentage points year over year to 79.3% with 
capacity expansion (73.2%) outweighing traffic growth (67.9%). 
4. To continue talks with Frontier and another bidder JetBlue Airways JBLU[10], Spirit Airlines postponed its 
shareholders' vote, which was scheduled for today. Management at SAVE stated that the shareholders of record as 
of the close of trading on May 6, 2022, are eligible to vote at the special meeting. Both JetBlue and Frontier are 
aiming to acquire Spirit Airlines to expand their network and take advantage of the continued improvement in air-
travel demand. The takeover battle comes at a time when the airline industry is struggling with staffing and aircraft 
shortages. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 
week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that almost all airline stocks have traded in the green over the past five trading days. The 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 1.3% to $56.46. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
has plummeted 32.5%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will await further updates on the ongoing 
takeover tussle surrounding Spirit Airlines in the coming days.

EasyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) has been reported to the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for cancelling flights at late 
notice and not giving customers enough help to be rerouted or compensated.
The budget airline has been reported to the CAA by consumer rights group Which?, which said it had requested an 
investigation.
It said British Airways, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG), was also potentially 
breaking the law, by "cancelling flights at the last minute, failing to reroute passengers [...and...] trying to dodge 
paying compensation".
Which? said many easyJet cancellations have taken place with passengers having already checked in, waiting in 
the departure lounge or even on the plane and waiting to take off. 
Some passengers the organisation spoke to were not being rerouted at the earliest opportunity or told about their 
rights to compensation.
"Passengers have been abandoned and left to arrange alternative flights home or hotels to stay in, leaving them 
significantly out of pocket."
It said it was told by many easyJet passengers that they had not been advised of their right to compensation for 
cancelled or disrupted flights, which goes against the company's legal requirements.
EasyJet reported to UK aviation authorities over lastminute cancellations
After Which? reported easyJet to the CAA, the regulator said: "We will review its latest evidence thoroughly and will 
respond accordingly.
"We have regularly called for stronger consumer powers, including the ability to impose fines on airlines. This would 
allow us to take faster action when appropriate and bring our powers in line with other sectoral regulators."
Ryanair is the only airline to have received an enforcement order from the CAA in the past two decades, with the 
Irish carrier still appealing against the 2018 ruling, despite losing in the High Court last year and at the Court of 
Appeal this year.

CAMEX Airlines (CMS, Tbilisi) has taken delivery of its first aircraft, a B737-800(BCF), necessary to complete 
certification by the end of July 2022 and launch in August.
2-BPDB (msn 33549), a 19-year-old ex-Ryanair Boeing jet, was ferried after P2F conversion from Guangzhou via 
Bishkek to Tbilisi on July 4, 2022. While it is already painted in CAMEX's livery, it has yet to be registered in 
Georgia. The aircraft is owned by Nomura Babcock & Brown and managed by BBAM.
The start-up confirmed to Cargo Facts that it expects its certification will take another two to three weeks. Once 
completed, it will launch in August 2022.
"We plan to connect southern and northern Chinese and regions in India with Europe and the Middle East regions. 
We already have memorandums in place to fly to Delhi Int'l, Hong Kong Int'l, Macau Int'l, and back to EU and 
Middle East regions," the start-up told ch-aviation.
CAMEX Airlines, which is backed by the US-based Gazelle Fund LLP, plans to add a further three B737-800(BCF)s 
by the end of the year. The second unit is scheduled to deliver in August 2022.
The airline told ch-aviation that it was planning to add two widebody aircraft (A330s or B767s) in 2023-2024.
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows the airline is the sixth cargo carrier trying to leverage Georgia's 
strategic location between Europe and Asia and the fourth operating B737NG converted freighters. Georgian 
Airlines operates a single B737-800(BCF), Georgian Airways - a single B737-800(SF), and MyWay Airlines - a 
single B737-700(BDSF). Easy Charter and Geo-Sky operate an A300B4(F) and two B747-200B(SF)s, respectively.

certification by the end of July 2022 and launch in August.
2-BPDB (msn 33549), a 19-year-old ex-Ryanair Boeing jet, was ferried after P2F conversion from Guangzhou via 
Bishkek to Tbilisi on July 4, 2022. While it is already painted in CAMEX's livery, it has yet to be registered in 
Georgia. The aircraft is owned by Nomura Babcock & Brown and managed by BBAM.
The start-up confirmed to Cargo Facts that it expects its certification will take another two to three weeks. Once 
completed, it will launch in August 2022.
"We plan to connect southern and northern Chinese and regions in India with Europe and the Middle East regions. 
We already have memorandums in place to fly to Delhi Int'l, Hong Kong Int'l, Macau Int'l, and back to EU and 
Middle East regions," the start-up told ch-aviation.
CAMEX Airlines, which is backed by the US-based Gazelle Fund LLP, plans to add a further three B737-800(BCF)s 
by the end of the year. The second unit is scheduled to deliver in August 2022.
The airline told ch-aviation that it was planning to add two widebody aircraft (A330s or B767s) in 2023-2024.
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows the airline is the sixth cargo carrier trying to leverage Georgia's 
strategic location between Europe and Asia and the fourth operating B737NG converted freighters. Georgian 
Airlines operates a single B737-800(BCF), Georgian Airways - a single B737-800(SF), and MyWay Airlines - a 
single B737-700(BDSF). Easy Charter and Geo-Sky operate an A300B4(F) and two B747-200B(SF)s, respectively.

Jul 07, 2022( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: https://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Society is changing rapidly, every day. We don't see it but, if you take a dip into the worlds of 1982, 1992, 2002, 
2012 and 2022, you can see the massive changes in how we live, work, relate, talk and transact. 
Back in the 1980s, no one had computers; we had rotary telephones; the main networks offered us three or four TV 
channels. The world was less connected and less informed. Travelling overseas was unusual, and travelling long-
haul unlikely for most. Most people dealt with banking in branches with passbooks and cheque books. 
In the 1990s, this changed. Many people started getting a computer in the home, a vision driven by Bill Gates. TV 
was still limited, unless you spent money on getting a chunky satellite on the top of your house. The world became 
more accessible as budget airlines launched. And the first call centre banks and, by the end of the decade, internet 
banks launched. 
In the 2000s, people were networked, the world had globalised and the world was at peace. The internet became 
the backbone of how society connected. Mobile telephones became prolific and, by the end of the decade, 
smartphones. YouTube was rapidly becoming more popular than the BBC and NBC. Hopping on and off an 
aeroplane became a no-brainer thanks to the likes of Ryanair and Southwest Airlines. And banking collapsed 
thanks to complex derivatives. Trust in banks went through the floor, laying the seeds for the rise of FinTech. 
In the 2010s, society changed again. People connected globally, but the world went back to behaving locally. Black 
Lives Matter, Greta Thunberg, David Attenborough and discussions of climate emergency, civil unrest and 
economic issues seemed to fill the news every day. Internet was now a human right, and creating your own media 
rather than consuming government media is the rage of the day. More photographs are taken every day than were 
ever taken in all of human history and jumping on a flight was like jumping on a train. FinTech and new digital 
currencies were the mainstream discussions, and banks? What's a bank? 
Now we are in the 2020s. A pandemic, runaway inflation, recessions, massive losses on investments and another 
decade of trials, struggles and consternation. Small businesses have never been challenged more, but then most 
people have never been more challenged. The threats of bad things - the world ending, going bankrupt, wars and 
the use of nuclear weapons - have never been more real. And yet things for the average Joe and Jane - or should I 
say they, he or her - goes on, as does technology. 
Society in the 2020s is developing into a more local and protective vision. The lockdowns have made us home 
buddies, and the idea of globalisation is disappearing. We still want to travel, but we are nervous about travelling. 
FinTech Forces of the Future, Part Three: People and Society
We are a nervous species. Wars have been happening throughout the last fifty years, but they're getting bigger and 
nearer. Suddenly, thanks to the conflict in the Ukraine, America and Europe's battle lines are being redrawn. China 
has become a visible threat to the Europe and American alliance, whilst Russia is a pariah. 
Society is worried, but continues to behave differently. Activism is far more rife than ever before. Activist 
movements like Extinction Rebellion are rife, because people no longer believe in politicians - they believe in the 
power of the network. 
This conflict between the power of the people through the network versus the power of the politicians through the 
government is the biggest social battle of the 2020s. It is evidenced by activist consumer movements, 
demonstrations, cryptocurrencies, cyberattacks, the rejection of traditional institutions and the growth of new 
institutions. 
The main street is dying, the malls are empty, the physical is dead. Consumers have doubled-down to become all 
digital. This has been driven by lockdown. You can't have much fun if you can't go out, but you can still watch 
Netflix and buy stuff from Amazon. 
All of this has culminated in a massive social change from physical to digital. In banking, it has created a mass 
move or has it? Not really. Banking is a strong and stable market. Consumers and businesses want reliability and 
resilience. In fact, in the 2020s, consumers and small businesses are better served than ever before but, primarily, 
by traditional banks who are integrating FinTech ideas. 
Society is becoming truly digital. 
You can work wherever you want to work, travel to where you want to go, eat whatever you want to eat and find 
love wherever love can be found. We are truly global, but very local. 
The future? The future society? 
The future society will take this one step beyond. We are about to become a multiplanetary society. Space tourism 
is already a thing, and a space hotel that is a bit like the International Space Station is already being built. Balloon 
flights to space and back in a few hours are possible, and the idea of humans settling on Mars is becoming more 
and more of a reality every day. 
The future society will be one where any human, anywhere in any part of our universe, can sit and chat, and trade 
and transact, because they're connected. The biggest issue is going to be if the connection breaks down. 
Nevertheless, when I think about generations before us, they had no idea. Just think, two centuries ago, most 
people were not educated. They couldn't read or write. Today, most countries encourage a basic level of education. 
Some countries ensure it. 
The more people who can read and write and communicate, the better the world becomes? The more the world 
progresses. The more we know, the better we get? I ask this as a question, as our globally connected world of 
social media and networking allows all of us to find out everything, everywhere. Does this make our world better? I 
don't have the answers, just raising the questions, but if I did try to answer I would say,yes.Our world is better 
because our ability to read, write and communicate, allows us to understand each other better. The more we talk, 
the better we become. 
As the eternal optimist, the future society feels like it will be one globally connected, globally communicated and 
with a global currency based upon a global network. We will all be assimilated and spend our holidays on Mars and 
our birthdays on Venus. Well, the men may go to Mars and the women to Venus at the very least[1].

 Flight cancellations and long queues have become the norm at Germany's understaffed airports. The hospitality 
sector is desperately looking to hire personnel, too.Amelie and her sister Amrei Quincke, from Essen in western 
Germany, were looking forward to a relaxing holiday in Budapest this summer. Two days before they were due to 
depart for Hungary, however, Eurowings cancelled their flight. So instead, they were forced to catch a train to 
Budapest, as no alternative flights were available. These days, many holidaymakers are experiencing similar 
ordeals. 
One reason for these flight cancellations are staff shortages at German airports. Some 7,200 vacant positions need 
to be filled, according to a study by the German Economic Institute (IW). This is a result of many airport workers 
leaving the aviation industry during the pandemic and finding employment elsewhere. With understaffed airports, 
holidaymakers are now facing countless flight cancellations and long queues at check-in and security. Germany's 
biggest carrier, Lufthansa, scrapped over 2,000 connections from Munich and Frankfurt airports this holiday 
season. An additional 900 bank holiday and weekend flights have been cancelled this July. 
No staff shortages at Deutsche Bahn 
Fortunately for Deutsche Bahn (DB), Germany's national railway company, staffing is not an issue. Last year, DB 
hired 22,000 new people nationwide. 
Frankfurt airport, one of Germany's major aviation hubs, is not so fortunate. It is seeing a high volume of inbound 
and outgoing flights, almost on par with pre-pandemic levels. But it is struggling to cope. Authorities have begun 
recruiting additional staff, especially for ground handling. But even if this recruitment drive proves successful, many 
believe travelers will have to prepare for long waits at Frankfurt airport over the next few months. 
Poor working conditions are another reason for staff shortages. The airline Ryanair, for instance, does not comply 
with labor laws and court rulings to respect workers' rights, say Spanish trade union USO. It has joined Sitcpla 
union is calling for strikes, which will affect all of Europe. 
Foreign workers to the rescue? 
The German government is thinking about bringing in scores of foreign workers to compensate for these protracted 
staff shortages. So far, recruiting foreigners, or hiring Ukrainian refugees, involved of a lot of paperwork in 
Germany. The general manager of the German Airports Association (ADV), Ralph Beisel, welcomes the plan to 
bring in workers from abroad, saying talks are being held with individual businesses in the aviation industry so that 
German tourist and hospitality industry mired by staff shortages
baggage handling companies and airports can start hiring soon. Airline Lufthansa, however, does not expect 
operations to normalize until 2023.  
Labor shortages predate the pandemic 
Germany's hospitality and catering industry, meanwhile, is even more short-staffed. Andrea Belegante, director of 
Germany's Catering Association (BdS), says this problem was already clearly noticeable before the COVID 
pandemic. The number of trainees in this industry has been steadily falling. To attract new staff, the industry 
organization has sought to establish standardized wages, additional work benefits and training deals. 
Germany's Institute for Employment Research (IAB) says the food-service industry has always been subject to staff 
fluctuations. If, however, companies fail to find people to fill these vacancies, these companies are left facing 
serious staff shortages. 
Hospitality sector under pressure 
The German Hotel and Restaurants Association (DEHOGA) says recruiting new staff is currently the biggest 
challenge facing the industry. It says over 60% of businesses in the industry are looking to hire. On top of this, the 
sector lost some €75billion ($77 billion) in revenue between March 2020 and 2022, due to pandemic-related 
restrictions. The last thing hotels and restaurants now need is more uncertainty. "Many companies will not survive a 
new round of restrictions and closures," says DEHOGA head Guido Zöllick. "Protecting companies and jobs must 
be a priority now." 
Amelie and her sister Amrei Quincke eventually reached Budapest by rail, and they enjoyed themselves a lot in the 
Hungarian capital. Their return flight with Eurowings, however, posed a new set of challenges. Heading to the 
airport, they received a text message informing them their flight would be delayed by an hour. Soon after, they 
received a second message, saying the flight would be two hours late. Yet at the airport, they were told nothing 
about delays. Suddenly, the sisters learned the flight was due to depart as scheduled, forcing them to sprint to their 
gate to catch the plane. 
Following further organizational chaos and delays, the two finally touched down in Germany. They hope their future 
travels won't be as exhausting and stressful.

new round of restrictions and closures," says DEHOGA head Guido Zöllick. "Protecting companies and jobs must 
be a priority now." 
Amelie and her sister Amrei Quincke eventually reached Budapest by rail, and they enjoyed themselves a lot in the 
Hungarian capital. Their return flight with Eurowings, however, posed a new set of challenges. Heading to the 
airport, they received a text message informing them their flight would be delayed by an hour. Soon after, they 
received a second message, saying the flight would be two hours late. Yet at the airport, they were told nothing 
about delays. Suddenly, the sisters learned the flight was due to depart as scheduled, forcing them to sprint to their 
gate to catch the plane. 
Following further organizational chaos and delays, the two finally touched down in Germany. They hope their future 
travels won't be as exhausting and stressful.

How to avoid the airport chaos this summer
How to avoid the airport chaos this summer

The Week UK

Jul 06, 2022( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ongoing chaos at UK airports has seen British Airways cancel flights for up to 105,000 holidaymakers due to strike 
action, hundreds of suitcases go missing, and the government forced to speed up security checks for new workers 
in an effort to ease the disruption. 
And this travel mayhem shows no sign of abating, with Heathrow, the UK's largest and busiest airport, warning last 
week that the nightmare could continue until 2026. 
 SEE MORE Is Brexit to blame for the travel chaos?[1] SEE MORE Half-term airport chaos: what's gone wrong?[2]  
As the school holidays kick off and Britain settles in for 'a summer of discontent for air travellers', as The Irish 
Times[3] described it, questions are being asked about how best to avoid the chaos - or at least make the 
experience of flying as stress-free as possible. 
Avoid certain airlines 
Figures obtained by thei news site[4] suggest that flights booked with certain airlines can be more at risk of 
cancellation than others. The stats, crunched by travel data analyst Cirium, show that Eurowings (Lufthansa's low-
cost subsidiary) had the highest overall percentage of cancelled flights for departures from UK airports in June, at 
15.686%. 
Eurowings was followed by Eastern Airways, Air France/KLM, easyJet, WizzAir, and British Airways, which together 
cancelled 419 flights in total. 
By contrast were Ryanair and TUI Airways, which cancelled just 32 and 27 flights respectively and recorded the 
lowest percentages of cancellations. 
So if you have more than one carrier option for reaching your destination, carefully choosing which one to go for 
could affect the likeness of your flight actually leaving the runway. 
Avoid these airports 
Data shows that not all airports are equal victims of the travel chaos, with some experiencing far more disruption 
than others. According to Cirium and the i news site, the airports with the highest percentage of cancelled 
departures between Easter and the end of June were Humberside (4.89%), Southampton (4.31%), London City 
(3.55%), Teeside (3.18%) and Gatwick and Bristol (both on 2.58%). 
'Some of the UK's busiest airports - Heathrow, Manchester, Stansted and Luton - saw less than 2% of flights 
cancelled, with Stansted experiencing just 0.24%,' added the paper. 
How to avoid the airport chaos this summer
Be savvy with your timings 
It is 'a misconception that flying early is a good way to dodge the worst of the airport queues', said Euro News[5]. 
The biggest queues at Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds Bradford airports are reportedly occurring in the early 
hours, between around 4am and 7am. 
Back in June, Leeds Live[6] said passengers had described Leeds Bradford Airport as being like a 'theme park' 
between the hours of 3am and 5am, when long queues could be seen outside the airport. 
Figures from global travel data provider OAG show that up to 13% of an entire day's flights departing from one of 
the UK's smaller airports leave between 6am and 7am. 
So if you're 'looking to book a flight somewhere soon', said Euro News, avoiding peak times by travelling at 
lunchtime 'could be your best bet'. 
Do as much as you can in advance 
Once your plane is booked and (hopefully) not cancelled, the government recommends[7] that you do as much 
'admin' as you can before you reach the airport. 
Check in online, if your airline allows it, as this means you can 'go straight to airport security' on arrival, if you don't 
have a bag to check in. 
Sort out your hand luggage at home and place any liquids (maximum size 100ml) - including make-up, toiletries and 
hand sanitiser - in a clear resealable plastic bag. 
Get your boarding pass ready too, as well as any Covid-19 documentation that's required by your destination. This 
will save considerable time at the airport. 
Stay at home on certain days 
It would be smart to avoid booking a flight on Friday 29 July, which is currently 'the busiest planned day for airline 
departures across the UK's airports', reported the i news site. On that day, Heathrow is scheduled to be the busiest 
airport, followed by Gatwick and then Manchester. 
According to the i, Fridays are generally the busiest day for departures, followed by Mondays and Sundays. 'Those 
looking for a last-minute escape that want to avoid pinch points should consider flying on a Tuesday, Wednesday or 
Thursday,' the paper recommends. 
Check your travel insurance 
The consumers' rights publication Which? has been urging air travellers to 'look closely at their policy ahead of 
expected summer disruption', specifically to see if they are covered for industrial action, said the BBC[8]. 
According to Which?, four in ten travel insurance policies offer no protection if flights are cancelled due to strikes. 
Anyone planning to fly this summer is advised to take a close look at their policy's terms and conditions as far in 
advance as possible, and plan accordingly if they are not covered. 
Look at other options 
'Despite rail strikes in the UK, looking into alternative ways to travel could be an option if you are yet to book your 
flights,' said Euro News. In general, railways have been less impacted by the recent travel chaos 'and connections 
across Europe are rapidly improving'. 
Rail travel is also a far greener option for holidaymakers. According to Eurail[9], the European rail pass company, 
taking the train is 'the most environmentally friendly way of travelling' after walking and cycling, with trains emitting

Ryanair staff confirm Spanish flight strike walkout dates in July
Ryanair staff confirm Spanish flight strike walkout dates in July

Travellers could face more chaos after Spain's Ryanair cabin crew voted to strike for another 12 days in July.
Workers affiliated with two Spanish unions are set to walk out from 12 to 15 July, 18 to 21 July and 25 to 28 July.
The new action follows weeks of chaos for the airline, which faced six days of strikes in recent weeks and was 
forced to cancel 10 Spanish flights on Saturday.
Staff want a deal that "guarantees decent work conditions for all personnel" at the airline, the USO and SITCPLA 
unions said in a joint statement.
The strikes come as European airports and carriers struggle to cope with a surge in travel demand, with thousands 
of flights cancelled over the past month.
How will the Ryanair strike impact your holiday?
Ryanair operates out of more than 20 airports in Spain.
However, the budget carrier does not expect widespread disruption, a spokesperson said.
"(We expect) minimal (if any) disruption to its flight schedules in July as a result of minor and poorly supported 
Spanish labour strikes", an airline spokesperson said on Saturday.
But the named Spanish unions claim otherwise. Both has threatened to coordinate action with other Ryanair staff in 
Belgium, France, Italy and Portugal.
A USO spokesperson demanded that Ryanair executives "change their attitude" towards negotiations.
"The unions and crew of Ryanair show their protest again in this way and demand a change of attitude from the 
airline.
"The unions and crew of Ryanair... ask [the airline] to resume the negotiation of a collective agreement that includes 
decent working conditions under Spanish law."
The strike coincides with industrial action by easyJet staff, who will strike for nine days in July.
Ryanair staff confirm Spanish flight strike walkout dates in July
Airports across the continent are contending with workplace walkouts.
Last month, industrial action forced multiple budget airlines - including Ryanair - to cancel flights to and from Italy, 
while a Thursday morning strike meant Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport had to scrap 100 flights.
This month, hundreds of British Airways staff at London's Heathrow will vote on whether or not to walk off the job to 
protest pay conditions.
GMB - the union leading the UK strike action - has warned that British Airways will face a "gruelling summer of 
travel chaos" if the company doesn't offer staff a pay hike.
Why are European airports so busy?
Roughly 191,000 European aviation workers have been made redundant over the pandemic.
Now, as travel demand surges, airports and airlines are too short-staffed to handle the influx.
The airline industry has launched a recruitment drive, but Air Council International - Europe's trade body for airports 
- predicts that delays are inevitable at two-thirds of European airports this summer.
British Airways was forced to scrap 8,000 flights in its March-October schedule this year, while easyJet has reduced 
its schedule by roughly 40 flights per day for the rest of June.
Airports are also feeling the heat. Security delays at Dublin Airport, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, and Manchester 
Airport have caused mammoth disruption for thousands of travellers.

EasyJet operating boss quits over chaos; Airlines Bellew leaves after wave of flight cancellations caused by 
sector staffing shortages
EasyJet operating boss quits over chaos; Airlines Bellew leaves after wave 
of flight cancellations caused by sector staffing shortages

Body
The executive responsible for running easyJet's operations has resigned after a gruelling period of disruption 
including thousands of flight cancellations.
The carrier said yesterday that Peter Bellew had resigned as chief operating officer but would remain temporarily to 
"ensure a smooth transition".
The departure comes after easyJet became one of the biggest casualties of the wave of disruption that has hit
Europe's airlines this year. The carrier has been forced to cancel thousands of flights in response to staff shortages 
that have disrupted the industry this summer, with some of the most damaging occurring during the UK school 
halfterm in June.
The airline was forced to cut back its summer schedule later that month as it attempted to restore order to its flight 
operations.
The airline cut about 10,000 of the 160,000 flights scheduled to run in July, August and September, with more than 
70 per cent of its customers moved to other flights within 24 hours of their original departure, the last being notified 
of changes yesterday.
EasyJet operating boss quits over chaos; Airlines Bellew leaves after wave of flight cancellations caused by 
sector staffing shortages
It leaves more than a quarter of prospective passengers on the affected flights facing a refund, rebooking to another 
flight on a different day, or having to accept a voucher for future use.
EasyJet's management has long insisted that it does not have a staffing problem, and argues that it has fallen 
victim to problems at airports, with shortages of air-traffic controllers and ground handlers.
The carrier has recruited more than 1,700 staff this year, meaning it has a similar number of employees as in 2019, 
despite planning to fly less.
But as passenger frustration has grown, chief executive Johan Lundgren has been under increasing pressure to get 
a grip on the situation.
British Airways, which has also suffered from heavy disruption this year, overhauled its senior management in May, 
including splitting the role of chief operating officer.
Bellew is a well-known figure in aviation. He joined easyJet from Ryanair in 2019, prompting an unsuccessful court 
challenge from the Irish airline to prevent him from working for a rival.
In April, British pilots' union Balpa said that Bellew was behind a breakdown in relations between pilots and 
easyJet's management, particularly in its handling of staff absences.
David Morgan, director of flight oper- ations, will take over as interim chief operating officer.
A well-respected figure in the organisation, Morgan was previously interim chief operating officer in 2019. With his 
background as a pilot, he is considered a more conciliatory figure than Bellew, according to one easyJet executive.

The executive responsible for running easyJet's operations has resigned after a gruelling period of disruption 
including thousands of flight cancellations.
The carrier said yesterday that Peter Bellew had resigned as chief operating officer but would remain temporarily to 
"ensure a smooth transition".
The departure comes after easyJet became one of the biggest casualties of the wave of disruption that has hit
Europe's airlines this year. The carrier has been forced to cancel thousands of flights in response to staff shortages 
that have disrupted the industry this summer, with some of the most damaging occurring during the UK school 
halfterm in June.
The airline was forced to cut back its summer schedule later that month as it attempted to restore order to its flight 
operations.
The airline cut about 10,000 of the 160,000 flights scheduled to run in July, August and September, with more than 
70 per cent of its customers moved to other flights within 24 hours of their original departure, the last being notified 
of changes yesterday.

sector staffing shortages
It leaves more than a quarter of prospective passengers on the affected flights facing a refund, rebooking to another 
flight on a different day, or having to accept a voucher for future use.
EasyJet's management has long insisted that it does not have a staffing problem, and argues that it has fallen 
victim to problems at airports, with shortages of air-traffic controllers and ground handlers.
The carrier has recruited more than 1,700 staff this year, meaning it has a similar number of employees as in 2019, 
despite planning to fly less.
But as passenger frustration has grown, chief executive Johan Lundgren has been under increasing pressure to get 
a grip on the situation.
British Airways, which has also suffered from heavy disruption this year, overhauled its senior management in May, 
including splitting the role of chief operating officer.
Bellew is a well-known figure in aviation. He joined easyJet from Ryanair in 2019, prompting an unsuccessful court 
challenge from the Irish airline to prevent him from working for a rival.
In April, British pilots' union Balpa said that Bellew was behind a breakdown in relations between pilots and 
easyJet's management, particularly in its handling of staff absences.
David Morgan, director of flight oper- ations, will take over as interim chief operating officer.
A well-respected figure in the organisation, Morgan was previously interim chief operating officer in 2019. With his 
background as a pilot, he is considered a more conciliatory figure than Bellew, according to one easyJet executive.
Lundgren said: "I would like to thank Peter for his hard work, and wish him well. Everyone at easyJet remains 
absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this summer.

RYANAIR had its busiest month ever in June, flying 15.9m passengers.
Its load factor reached 95 per cent for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic.
The budget airline said it operated over 88,500 flights last month and expects to fly 15 per cent more passengers 
this summer than in the same busy period in 2019.
Ryanair has been spared the ongoing travel disruption which has afflicted rivals such as Easyjet.
The news comes after Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary last week warned fares will only continue to rise over the next 
five years.

Jul 05, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Labor trouble has emerged as a major pain point for the Airline industry of late. Amid this problem, European 
carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] received some encouraging tidings when it reached a pay-related agreement 
with the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA). 
The deal will accelerate pay restoration of pilots at RYAAY, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and 
ensure pay hikes post restoration through 2026. The restoration of pay is necessary as RYAAY intends to expand 
capacity as much as 115% of the pre-coronavirus levels in the current year itself to meet the demand swell. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[2] 
Per Ryanair's people director Darrell Hughes 'While 100% of our pilots across our European network are covered 
by 2020 Emergency Agreements, we continue to work with our pilots and their unions on new deals, similar to this 
one concluded with BALPA, and have successfully re-negotiated improved long-term agreements with 70% of our 
pilots, running until 2026 or 2027 as we prioritize pay restoration.' Naturally, for this capacity expansion, it is 
imperative to keep RYAAY's group of pilots satisfied. The pay increments apart, pilots at RYAAY also become 
eligible for other benefits. 
That air-travel demand is northbound can be gauged from Ryanair's traffic report for June, where it operated more 
than 8,500 flights. RYAAY attracted 15.9 million passengers in the month, up 203% year over year. Load factor (% 
of seats filled with passengers) touched 95% in June from 72% a year ago. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked 
stocks in the broader ZacksTransportation[3]sector areKirbyKEX[4] and C.H. Robinson WorldwideCHRW[5]. 
Kirby has an expected earnings growth rate of 278.6% for the current year. KEX delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.7%, on average. 
Kirby has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. Shares of KEX have gained 2.3% so far this year. Gradual 
recovery in economic conditions is benefiting Kirby. 
C.H. Robinson has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.9% for the current year. CHRW delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 17.1%, on average. 
C.H. Robinson has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9%. Shares of CHRW have gained 8.8% over the past year. 
Uptick in freight conditions in the United States aids C.H. Robinson. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) Inks Deal With UK Pilots' Union
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

An easyJet flight from London to Menorca was intercepted by a Spanish Air Force fighter after a bomb threat was 
detected.
The Airbus A319 registered G-EZAO was carrying out easyJet flight EZY8303 from London Gatwick Airport (LGW) 
in the United Kingdom to Mahon Menorca Airport (MAH) in Spain on July 3, 2022.
An emergency protocol was triggered when law enforcement detected a bomb threat on social media, according to 
local media publication Menorca Info. As a result, a Spanish Air Force F/A-18 Hornet fighter scrambled to intercept 
the flight as it entered the country's airspace.
Upon landing at Menorca Airport, officers of the Spanish Guardia Civil, including a canine bomb-sniffing unit, 
inspected the aircraft as well as the onboard luggage and freight before questioning each passenger. Eventually, 
the threat was deemed a false alarm.
The incident caused some disruption to the airport's operations, delaying the affected aircraft's next flight, as well as 
another departing Ryanair flight, by a few hours.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline easyJet PLC on Monday announced the resignation of Chief Operating Officer 
Peter Bellew after a pandemic bounce-back marred by flight cancellations and travel chaos. 
He will be replaced on an interim basis by David Morgan, who had once held the role for a year in 2019. Bellew has 
resigned "to pursue other business opportunities", easyJet said.
Bellew had been part of the Luton Airport-based budget airline for three years since 2019. Prior to that, Bellew had 
rejoined Ryanair Holdings PLC in late 2017, having been chief executive officer of Malaysia Airlines. He previously 
had been had been director of flight operations for Ryanair until 2014.
Airlines have been scrambling this year to meet pent-up demand for travel post-Covid, particularly in the peak 
school holiday periods. However, easyJet has come under significant pressure has it has been one of the worst hit 
for cancellations in recent months.
The company has blamed air traffic control delays, staff shortages in ground handling and at airports and increased 
ID check times. 
Last month, easyJet said it was "proactively" cancelling flights at Gatwick in response to a cap introduced by the 
airport and warned there would be a cost impact from recent disruption and the measures taken to combat it.
Chief Executive Johan Lundgren apologised at that time, saying easyJet was "sorry that for some customers we 
have not been able to deliver the service they have come to expect from us".
Lundgren on Monday commenting on Bellew's departure said: "I would like to thank Peter for his hard work and 
wish him well. Everyone at easyJet remains absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this 
summer. I am pleased that Operations will be in the very capable hands of David Morgan who can move 
seamlessly into this role having previously led the operation, as interim chief operating officer, throughout 2019."

EASYJET's senior executives are jetting off to Mallorca tomorrow, as thousands of passengers bear the weight of 
the ongoing travel chaos.
The airline's management team will have a two-night corporate retreat at luxury resort Iberostar in Palma, which 
counts an infinity pool and a sunset champagne bar among its many amenities.
Bosses will leave tomorrow from Luton and Gatwick, as first reported by the Sunday Times.
The trip will take place two days after the low-cost carrier was forced to axe several flights as around 450 Spanish 
cabin crew members walked out over deteriorating working conditions.
Members of Spanish union USO working at Barcelona, Malaga and Palma de Mallorca's airports are set to go on 
strike for another six days throughout July, between 15 and 17 and 29 and 31 July.
Over the last few weeks, strike-induced disruption has impacted major airlines such as Ryanair.
Cabin crew members in several EU countries such as Portugal, France and Italy went on strike at the end of June.
While those going abroad face disruption because of striking workers, travellers at UK airports also continue to face 
chaos.
Despite government efforts to speed up staff security checks, lengthy queues and delays persist at major hubs such 
as Heathrow.
Easyjet bosses jet away as travel chaos continues
The Department for Transport (DfT) said yesterday counter-terrorism checks were now being processed in 10 days 
on average - half the time it took in March - while accreditation now takes five days.
When asked by the Sunday Times, Easyjet defended its senior executives' Mallorca trip, saying it was "entirely 
appropriate for the management board to undertake business meetings around the network". The management 
board remains "absolutely focused" on the firm's daily operations, it added.

WHAT IS IT? Pulling up to Château Capitoul at night gives only the smallest hint towards what to expect. The pitch 
black countryside just outside of Narbonne on the Mediterranean coast gives way to a long, tree-lined approach, at 
the end of which rests an imposing, underlit neo-gothic Château, which wouldn't look out of place on a windswept 
Yorkshire moor. Come morning that countryside reveals itself to be endless, rolling vineyards, beautifully framed by 
my shuttered third storey window.
Château Capitoul is several things at once: there's the aforementioned Château, essentially a boutique hotel of its 
own, with eight rooms connected by a central staircase complete with chandeliers and original art.
There's also a 44-villa "hamlet", with rooms varying in size from "very comfortable indeed" to "absolutely bloody 
massive". Some come with their own plunge pools, every room is en suite, and they're all built to make the most of 
the views across the vineyards to the Pyrenees or down to the ocean, which is a 10 minute drive away.
Then there's the working vineyard, winery and wine shop, where a range of bottles are produced, aged and sold. 
Renowned hoteliers Karl O'Hanlon and Anita Forte are beyond the project, having already seen huge success with 
sister properties Château Les Carrasses and Château St-Pierre de Serjac, both of which are nearby.
HOW DO YOU GET THERE? Capitoul is a 40 minute drive from Béziers airport, a tiny, one terminal affair serviced 
by Ryanair, who practically give away tickets on this route (there are some listed for this week for £21 return). 
Toulouse- Blagnac airport isn't much further, and Capitoul can arrange a car from either. Alternatively, you can 
CHÂTEAU CAPITOUL NARBONNE This vineyard hotel is a delicious combination of the rustic and the 
luxurious, writes Steve Dineen
catch the TGV from Paris, which will take a little under five hours but is a beautiful and relaxing way to travel. You 
could link up from the Eurostar, or, as I did, spend some time in the capital before heading south. WHAT'S IT LIKE?
Château Capitoul is almost incongruously luxurious compared to the working vineyards that surround it. Everything 
from the huge, sunbaked terrace to the infinity pool to the ever-present hiss of cicadas draw your attention out 
towards the vines, and a walk through the wild-looking but carefully planned gardens - designed by James Basson, 
if you're into that kind of thing - to inspect the grapes yourself is a must.
Rooms in the villa are in keeping with the rustic surroundings - mine featured views across to the mountains and 
plush velvet furniture, all intercut by dramatic wooden beams. It also came with a free-standing bath, which is the 
ideal location to sample the local produce.
The villas are more modern - the epitome of neutral-hued sophistication. Built around facilities including a pétanque 
alley and tennis courts, it reminded me of something from JG Ballad's novel Super Cannes, only with fewer 
murders. The villas and the Château sandwich the modern reception area, which also houses the main restaurant.
WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD? After breakfast Asado becomes a Mediterranean grill; I had an excellent grilled 
cuttlefish one afternoon and an equally well prepared lamb chop the next. The French don't mess this stuff up.
But if you want something special, you'll want to try the fine dining restaurant Mediterraneo, where chef Valere 
Diochet creates a pan-Mediterranean tasting menu using whatever he can find locally. There are the usual 
spherifications and emulsifications but the result is surprisingly restrained, simple dishes made in inventive ways. It 
only opened a few months ago but this is a Michelin star in the waiting - and at (EURO)90 for seven courses (plus 
the rest), it's not unreasonable, either.
WHAT ELSE? You can arrange to hire a bike or jump in the car and drive to the beach but I opted to stay on-site, 
taking a tour of the vineyard and then tasting the produce myself. You can tailor a tasting to your tastes and wallet - 
I sampled the current range and finished with a splash of the 2003 La Clape, one of the most notable vintages of 
recent times. I recommend doing the tasting before dinner so you can order from the wine list with authority.
Elsewhere you can book a massage at the subterranean spa, wander the vineyards, or simply lie by the pool, 
listening to the cicadas and watching the grapes grow.
An overnight stay in a hotel room at Château Capitoul is from (EURO)220 on a B&B basis. For further information

Jul 04, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] staff across various parts of Europe have been on strike lately as they demand 
improved pay and better working conditions. To this end, per a Reuters report[2], Ryanair's Spain-based cabin crew 
announced its plans to strike for 12 days this month. The dates are Jul 12-15, 18-21 and 25-28 across 10 Spanish 
airports. This latest announcement came on the final day of the crew's current strike, leading to the cancellation of 
10 flights in Spain on Jul 2. 
A Spain-based cabin crew at easyJet are striking for nine days this month for higher pay. easyJet canceled five 
flights from Spain on Jul 2. Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport workers were on strike on Jul 1 and Jul 2, leading to the 
cancellation of almost 10% of flights. 
Meanwhile, a popular holiday destination in Portugal (despite facing no ongoing strikes) is expected to suffer from 
65 flight cancellations to and from Lisbon on Jul 2, backed by a combined impact of flight disruptions at multiple 
European airports. 
So far, despite facing strikes in recent days by cabin crew unions in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy, 
Ryanair claims to have witnessed minimal impact on its operations over the Jun 24-26 weekend. 
RYAAY continues to hope that impending strikes may not affect its operations. However, Air Traffic Control strikes 
and airport staff shortages across Europe are some factors that can cause minor travel chaos. 
Such flight disruptions due to staff shortage during the peak summer travel period seem to be a hindrance for this 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) European carrier. Notably, shares of RYAAY have lost 32.9% year to date compared with 
23.1% loss of the industry[3] it belongs to.

The negativity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being 
revised 11.6% downward over the past 90 days. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the broader 
ZacksTransportation[4]sector are Kirby KEX[5], C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW[6] andDiana Shipping Inc. 
DSX[7], each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)

 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

Airlines in Europe and the US recently raised fares amid the summer travel boom, which also forced some air

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) continues to expect "minimal (if any) disruptions" to its flights in July despite a planned 12-day 
strike by its Spain-based crew, according to a Sunday statement from the Irish budget airline.
The carrier added that the Europe-wide air traffic control strikes and airport staff shortages may lead to minor 
disruptions and travelers will be notified via email or SMS.
The statement follows labor unions USO and SICTPLA's announcement that they will again go on strike from July 
12-15, 18-21, and 25-28, across 10 Spanish airports where Ryanair has operations. The organizations also urged 
the Spanish labor ministry to compel Ryanair in following the country's laws.
During an initial six-day strike in June, 215 flights to or from Spain were canceled, with over 1,255 delayed.
Ryanair traded 2% in the green at the close of July 1.

The cabin crew staff at low-cost airline Ryanair plans to strike for better working conditions on 12 more days in July, 
as a wave of industrial action hits Spain during the busy holiday season.
The walkouts have been scheduled for July 12-15, 18-21, and 25-28, the Spanish unions USO and Sitcpla 
announced on Saturday.
Numerous airports are affected by the Ryanair strikes: Madrid, Barcelona and Mallorca, as well as Málaga, Seville, 
Alicante, Valencia, Girona, Ibiza and Santiago de Compostela.
Ryanair cabin crew had already gone on strike in Spain at the end of June and also between Thursday and 
Saturday. The Irish airline "does not respect court rulings and laws and uses fear, coercion and threats against its 
workers," USO said. Labour Minister Yolanda Díaz must intervene, it said.
The cabin crew of rival airline Easyjet will also stop work in Spain on a total of nine days between through the end 
of July - as early as this weekend, as well as between July 15-17 and between July 29-31.
In the case of the British airline, the cabin crew is demanding significantly higher salaries as well as a limit to flying 
times, as is the case in other countries.
On Saturday, 15 flights were cancelled throughout Spain by the afternoon because of the strikes - 10 Ryanair and 
five Easyjet flights - state television station RTVE reported, citing the authorities. In addition, there were around 200 
delays.
However, there were no cancellations on Mallorca on Saturday for the time being.

More airline strikes to hit Spain, causing trouble for holiday season
Because of the maintenance of "minimum services" prescribed by Spanish legislation in the event of strikes, only 
some flights, often only a relatively small proportion - may be cancelled.
In the case of the Ryanair strikes, for example, the Transport Ministry in Madrid decided that between 73% (Alicante 
and Palma de Mallorca) and 82% (Ibiza) of all programmed flights must be completed on the strike days, depending 
on the airport.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, pioneer of low-cost travel in Europe, has warned that fares will rise for the next five 
years because flying has become "too cheap" to make profits as industry costs spiral.
His comments came as ticket prices have risen in Europe and the US as passengers return and some airlines cut 
capacity because of staff shortages.
"It's got too cheap for what it is. I find it absurd every time that I fly to Stansted, the train journey into central London 
is more expensive than the air fare," he said in an interview with the Financial Times. A combination of high oil 
prices and environmental charges will push the average Ryanair fare up from (EURO)40 to between (EURO)50 and 
(EURO)60 over the medium term, he added.
O'Leary turned Ryanair into the biggest airline in Europe by ruthlessly cutting costs, and passing the savings on to 
consumers through cheap tickets.
"It has been my doing [making air travel cheap]. I made a lot of money doing it. But ultimately, I don't believe air 
travel is sustainable over the medium term at an average fare of (EURO)40. But I think, you know, it will still be very 
cheap and affordable at (EURO)50 and (EURO)60."
Air travellers face years of rising fares, warns Ryanair 's O'Leary Flying has become 'too cheap' ? Fuel and staff 
costs hit hard ? Anger over Brexit effect
Median fares from London to summer destinations in Portugal, Spain and Greece have all jumped compared with a 
year ago, although they are significantly lower than 10 years ago, according to data from www.Kayak.com.
Ryanair rivals EASYJET and Wizz Air have also reported higher fares in recent investor updates but O'Leary is one 
of the first airline bosses to warn about an increase in fares in the longer term.
The Ryanair boss expects oil prices to remain "structurally higher" for four or five years and wider inflationary 
pressures to hit the industry next year, including staff costs and air traffic control charges.
He also highlighted the impact of environmental charges, under which airlines buy tradeable credits to cover the 
amount they pollute under parallel emissions systems in the UK and the EU.
O'Leary fired a broadside at the government over Brexit for stopping airlines easily recruiting European workers, 
which the industry says has worsened staff issues. "This is without doubt one of the inevitable consequences of the 
disaster that has been Brexit," he said. "Withdrawing from the single market, just so that they can say 'we got Brexit 
done' was the height of idiocy."
Ryanair has been virtually the only major carrier in Europe to dodge the staff shortage disruption as it did not sack 
swaths of its staff when Covid-19 struck. But O'Leary refused to criticise other airlines for their decisions during the 
pandemic. "I would not be critical of competitor airlines. Covid has been unbelievably difficult to manage your way 
through."
The Department for Transport said there had been disruption around the world because of staff shortages. "It is not 
obvious that reaching for the lever marked 'more immigration' will solve the problem," it said.

Michael O'Leary, the pioneer of lowcost travel in Europe, has warned fares will rise for the next five years because 
flying has become "too cheap" to make profits as industry costs spiral.
The Ryanair boss's warning comes as ticket prices have risen in Europe and the US this summer as passengers 
return and some airlines cut capacity because of staff shortages.
"It's got too cheap for what it is. I find it absurd every time that I fly to Stansted, the train journey into central London 
is more expensive than the air fare," he said in an interview with the Financial Times.

doubt one of the inevitable consequences of the disaster that has been Brexit," he said. "Withdrawing from the 
single market, just so that they can say 'we got Brexit done' was the height of idiocy. But then they are idiots."
O'Leary turned Ryanair from a small regional carrier in the 1990s into the biggest airline in Europe by ruthlessly 
cutting costs and passing savings to consumers through cheap ticket prices.

"It has been my doing [making air travel cheap]. I made a lot of money doing it. But, ultimately, I don't believe air 
travel is sustainable over the medium term at an average fare of (EURO)40. It's too cheap at that. But I think, you 
know, it will still be very cheap and affordable at (EURO)50 and (EURO)60."
Median fares from London to summer destinations in Portugal, Spain and Greece have all jumped compared with a 
year ago, although they are significantly lower than 10 years ago, according to data from www.Kayak.com.
O'Leary is one of the first airline bosses to warn about an increase in fares in the longer term. The airline had 
hedged the majority of its fuel requirements for the rest of this year at $65 a barrel before Russia invaded Ukraine, 
saving it from the worst impact of the sharp rise in prices.
But the Ryanair boss still thinks fares will rise as he expects oil prices to remain "structurally higher" for the next 
four or five years, "until we can wean ourselves off Russian oil and gas" and wider inflationary pressures to hit the 
airline industry next year, including staff costs and air traffic control charges.

 Airlines hoping to cash in on renewed demand are facing labor agitation after firing swathes of workers during the 
pandemic.Hundreds of flights from various European airports were canceled or delayed on Saturday as the industry 
struggles with ongoing worker strikes. 
Labor action by cabin crews at the two low-cost airlines EasyJet and Ryanair as well as by airport workers in 
Europe's second-busiest airport — Roissy-Charles de Gaulle in Paris — are causing major headaches for airlines 
just as the first school summer holidays begin after two years of pandemic restrictions. 
One in five flights from the main Paris airport were canceled on Saturday morning, while the EasyJet and Ryanair 
strike led to the cancellation of 15 flights to and from Spain with another 175 delayed. 
Ryanair's cabin crew also announced another 12 days of work stoppages. Paris airport workers said they will walk 
out again on July 8 to 10. 
Low-cast airlines facing further strike disruptions 
The striking cabin crews are demanding improvements to their working conditions and pay to put them in line with 
other European airlines. 
Ryanair employees have been striking since June 24, with the aim of bringing the company to the negotiation table, 
while EasyJet cabin crews joined the strike on Friday. 
"After six days of strike and in view of the unwillingness of the company to listen to its staff and its preference for 
leaving thousands of passengers grounded rather than sitting down to negotiate an agreement under Spanish law, 
we have been forced to call new strike days," Lidia Arasanz from the USO union that has organized the Ryanair 
workers was quoted by AFP as saying. 
Arasanz said that the initial strike had seen a total so far of "more than 200 flights canceled and almost 1,000 
delays," adding that the new strike could cause even more disruptions. 
Strike action in France and Scandinavia 
Airport workers at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle are fighting for a wage hike to balance out rising costs from inflation. 
They had been offered a 4% pay increase on the condition that they end the strike on Friday, but this was rejected. 
"A majority of workers think the offer is not good enough," Daniel Bertone, who represents the CGT union, was 
quoted by Reuters as saying. "They don't trust management and they don't accept the 'it's this or nothing' 
blackmail." 
The industry slashed thousands of jobs during the pandemic when people were unable or unwilling to fly, but they 
have been unable to refill positions as the new post-restrictions demand has soared. 
European flights canceled and delayed amid ongoing strikes
Airports in the UK and the Netherlands struggled to deal with the surge in traffic earlier in the year, while France 
was largely spared. 
Pilots for the Scandinavian SAS airline delayed a planned strike on Saturday after negotiations with company 
management showed some progress. If the 900 pilots go ahead with their strike, hundreds of flights per day will 
likely be canceled.

Strikes, slowdowns and staff shortages are causing chaos with Europe's air travel, but what are your rights when it 
comes to flight cancellations?
Under EU rules, if your flight is cancelled the airline must give you a refund or reschedule the flight, even if it means 
using a different carrier.
You are also entitled to extra compensation and accommodation expenses, if necessary.
"If you have a storm or if you have a strike from the airport staff, for instance, which is an extraordinary 
circumstance, you don't have the right to compensation," Steven Berger, a legal officer at The European Consumer 
Organisation (BEUC), told Euronews.
"In other situations, you have the right to compensation. The amount of this compensation varies on the distance of 
your flights."
This can range from (EURO)250 to (EURO)600.
According to BEUC, airlines often leave passengers in the dark, failing to make the rules clear. It wants more 
regulations to include automatic compensation if things go wrong.
"There should be a deterrent effect on the airlines to avoid the replication of the different unfair practices or the fact 
that consumers have to wait for a month to be reimbursed. Where in the regulation it's seven days," Berger said.
"We need really to make sure that the rights are respected in terms of timeline for reimbursement. It should be in 
cash and not in vouchers. This should always be a decision of the consumers to be reimbursed in vouchers or not."
Belgian Daniel Rothier is one of the many victims of the recent spate of cancellations.
His trip to Verona earlier this month became a nightmare when his inbound flight was cancelled with no explanation.
"On June 7th we learnt, by email, that the flight on June 8th was cancelled," Rottier told Euronews. "The only 
solution proposed was to try to get a seat on the plane leaving on June 10th, two days later.
What are your rights when it comes to flight cancellations?
"We asked our Airbnb host if we could stay longer. After some trouble we managed to stay longer, although not at 
the same price...It was a Ryanair flight. They didn't give us any explanation. We tried to contact them by mail, 
telephone, but with no answer."
He is now claiming compensation for the extra costs incurred.
Ryanair disputes this claim, however.
It told Euronews in a statement that: "Ryanair is operating its full flight schedules this summer, with no disruptions 
due to staffing shortages, unlike many other airlines who have failed to plan adequately for the return of travel post 
COVID. Air Traffic Controller (ATC) strikes and airport staff shortages may cause minor disruption throughout the 
summer season.
"Any claims that Ryanair's compensation claim systems are unfair and complicated are completely false. All 
passengers who encounter disruption are informed of all their options and entitlements through email/SMS and all 
information is readily available on Ryanair.com."
In some cases, as in Brussels last week, flights were cancelled due to airport staff striking. In this case it is not the 
fault of the airline, raising even more questions about compensation.
Dublin airport has taken the matter into its own hands, announcing that it will refund passengers who have been 
affected by flight cancellations.
So far though, the Irish airport is an outlier, with many consumers still left out of pocket.

 Nine flights to and from Spain were cancelled on Friday and dozens of others delayed due to the latest strike by 
cabin crew at low-cost airlines Ryanair and EasyJet. 
The work stoppage over pay and working conditions comes as European schools are breaking up for the summer. 
The strikes add more headaches to passengers and the aviation sector, which has struggled with staff shortages as 
it struggles to recruit people after massive layoffs during the Covid pandemic. 
By 1:00 pm (1100 GMT) eight EasyJet flights had been cancelled and 21 delayed, the USO union which called the 
strike said. 
One Ryanair flight was cancelled and 113 were delayed, it added.

EasyJet crew are set to strike during the first three weekends of July to demand parity in working conditions in line 
with other European airlines. 
The strike by Ryanair cabin crew in Spain, where there are some 1,900 employees, began on June 24 and is due to 
run until Saturday. It is affecting 10 of the airline's bases in Spain. 
On Thursday over 50 Ryanair flights to and from the country were cancelled because of the job action. 
A strike by the airline's crew between June 24 and 26 cancelled 129 flights. 
Flights from Paris' two largest airports, Charles de Gaulle and Orly, were disrupted on Friday for the second day in 
a row due to a strike by airport workers.

Ryanair has decided to extend by four years most leases of the Airbus A320 aircraft that operate for subsidiary 
Lauda.
Once finalised, the deal will lock in "material rent savings", said Ryanair.
The Dublin-based low-cost carrier said that extension, which runs until 2024, followed a review of Boeing 737NG 
leasing opportunities and "Boeing's failure to agree competitive pricing on a new aircraft order".   In May, Airfinance 
Journal reported that Ryanair had described a "phenomenal" response to an RFP to lease up to 50 used 
narrowbody aircraft.
The carrier exclusively operates Boeing 737 aircraft in its mainline operations, but inherited A320s when it acquired 
Laudamotion in 2019.
In September 2021, Ryanair end talks with Boeing over a potential 737 Max 10 order due to disagreements over 
pricing.
In the first quarter of its 2023 financial year, Ryanair reported revenues of (EURO)2.6 billion ($2.6 billion), seven 
times higher than in the previous year's quarter.
Net profit was (EURO)170 million for the three months to 30 June, versus a net loss of (EURO)273 million a year 
earlier.
Net debt at 30 June fell to (EURO)200 million from (EURO)1.45 billion at 31 March.
Despite peak capital expenditure this year and next, Ryanair expects to achieve to achieve a broadly zero net debt 
position over the next two years.
The airline is withholding guidance for fiscal year 2023 due to "limited visibility into the second half of second 
quarter and almost zero visibility into the second half, when we are typically loss making", it said.

Condor seeks narrowbody leases for earlier deliveries

German leisure carrier Condor Airlines is tipped to place an order for Airbus A321s at the Farnborough air show but 
is in talks with lessors about earlier delivery slots, sources indicate.
The carrier is looking to secure positions ahead of the 2027 delivery date quoted by Airbus.
As part of its narrowbody fleet campaign, Condor also considered the Boeing 737 Max 10, sources add.
Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker shows that Condor operates a mostly leased fleet including 12 A320s, 10 A321s, 
four A330-200s, as well as 13 Boeing 757-300s and 13 767-300ERs.
In July 2021 Condor announced an order for 16 Airbus A330-900s to replace its 767 fleet. The order makes it the 
first German operator of the model. The first aircraft is expected to arrive in autumn 2022, while the replacement of 
the entire long-haul fleet is scheduled to be completed in mid-2024.
Condor's fleet campaign follows the EU's General Court ruling that upheld the legitimacy of government aid, 
following the collapse of its parent company Thomas Cook.
Ryanair challenged the $580 million German state-guaranteed loan for Condor, which had filed for insolvency in 
September 2019. On 18 May, the EU's General Court ruled Ryanair had failed to demonstrate any grounds for 
doubt regarding the European Commission's handling of the loan application.
"The General Court dismisses the action in its entirety.
"The applicant did not succeed in rebutting the Commission's findings that Condor's difficulties were the result 
mainly of the Thomas Cook group being placed into liquidation and not of an arbitrary allocation of costs within the 
group," the court said.

 Nine flights to and from Spain were cancelled on Friday and dozens of others delayed due to the latest strike by 
cabin crew at low-cost airlines Ryanair and EasyJet. 
The work stoppage over pay and working conditions comes as European schools are breaking up for the summer. 
The strikes add more headaches to passengers and the aviation sector, which has struggled with staff shortages as 
it struggles to recruit people after massive layoffs during the Covid pandemic. 
By 1:00 pm (1100 GMT) eight EasyJet flights had been cancelled and 21 delayed, the USO union which called the 
strike said. 
One Ryanair flight was cancelled and 113 were delayed, it added. 
EasyJet crew are set to strike during the first three weekends of July to demand parity in working conditions in line 
with other European airlines. 
The strike by Ryanair cabin crew in Spain, where there are some 1,900 employees, began on June 24 and is due to 
run until Saturday. It is affecting 10 of the airline's bases in Spain. 
On Thursday over 50 Ryanair flights to and from the country were cancelled because of the job action. 
A strike by the airline's crew between June 24 and 26 cancelled 129 flights. 
Flights from Paris' two largest airports, Charles de Gaulle and Orly, were disrupted on Friday for the second day in 
a row due to a strike by airport workers.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) on Thursday canceled 54 flights to and from Spain, while at least 300 were delayed due to the 
ongoing strike of crew members, the labor union USO said in a statement. 
The budget airline claimed that 100% of scheduled flights were operational, however, USO said it did not call for its 
full crew at certain airports. The labor organization also slammed Ryanair for bringing in crews from other countries 
to operate Spanish flights, an action that violates the right to strike.
The strike action, which entered its fourth day on Thursday, will continue until Saturday.
Ryanair declined nearly 3% on Thursday's close.

"We are pleased to have promptly concluded the lease extensions negotiations with Ryanair, a key strategic partner 
to Deucalion Aviation, which will see the Airbus A320ceo aircraft in operation within the Ryanair group for the 
foreseeable future," commented co-chief executive officer and chief operating officer Jon Skirrow.

Journal Fleet Tracker data shows.
Earlier this year BBAM closed its latest flagship aircraft leasing fund, Incline Aviation II, with total capital 
commitments of approximately $1.5 billion.
In 2017, the firm closed Incline Aviation I, an $881 million fund dedicated to investing in leased commercial aircraft.
BBAM has signed agreements for more than 30 conversions for 737-800 aircraft.

Japanese bank-backed aircraft leasing company SMBC Aviation Capital (SMBC AC) has agreed a lease mandate 
with IAG carrier Air Europa covering three Boeing 737-800 aircraft, sources close to the deal say.
The deal comprises a 2012-vintage 737-800 and two 2009-manufactured 737-800s. The CFM56-equipped 
narrowbodies were previously operated by Ukraine Airlines International and Ryanair.
Earlier this year Madrid-based Air Europa said that it hoped to offer more capacity this summer than it did pre-
Covid.
The airline is also sourcing additional 737-800s from lessors including Stratos; it also is adding 787 widebody 
capacity by means of 18-month subleases from Norse Atlantic Airways.
SMBC AC has an owned, managed and committed fleet of over 730 aircraft. Established in 2001, the lessor was 
acquired in 2012 by a consortium comprising SMFG and Sumitomo.
In addition to the incoming 737-800s, Air Europa continues to lease five 787-8 widebodies from SMBC AC.

RYANAIR and UK pilot union Balpa yesterday reached an agreement to restore pilots' pre-pandemic pay, after staff 
agreed a 20 per cent cut during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The airline pledged to increase its UK pilots' pay, as it forecasted its capacity will grow 115 per cent on pre-
pandemic levels this year.
Under the newly agreed deal,
Ryanair will restore 10 per cent now, and another 10 per cent next April, subject to the recovery of the business. 
Ryanair's pilots are also set to receive additional benefits, such as pay enhancements, until 2026.
"While the recovery from the impact of the pandemic is still ongoing and our industry faces significant challenges, 
this longterm agreement delivers stability, accelerated pay restoration, future pay increases and other benefit 
improvements for our UK pilots," said Ryanair's people director Darrell Hughes.
Hughes added the airline had renegotiated agreements with 70 per cent of its total pilots.
The news comes as Ryanair's EU staff joined a continent-wide wave of discontent and voted in favour of strikes. 
Last weekend, cabin crew members in Belgium, Portugal and Spain staged a three-day walkout.

Ryanair's UK pilots have approved a deal on restoring pay to pre-pandemic levels, the low-cost carrier has 
announced.
The Irish airline said that the deal, which was negotiated with UK pilots' union BALPA, covers the restoration of pay 
and will also deliver pay increases in the period to 2026.
"While the recovery from the impact of the pandemic is still ongoing and our industry faces significant challenges, 
this long-term agreement delivers stability, accelerated pay restoration, future pay increases and other benefit 
improvements for our UK pilots," People Director Darrell Hughes, said in a statement on June 30, 2022.
Ryanair has sprung back faster than other European carriers from the pandemic and expects to operate 115% of 
pre-COVID capacity this year. It said it is prioritizing restoring pay for its staff to "keep jobs secure and have a 
foundation for growth".
During the pandemic, Ryanair chose to keep staff on but at lower pay levels. Hughes said the airline was working 
with pilots and unions across Europe on new deals to restore pay.
"While 100% of our pilots across our European network are covered by 2020 Emergency Agreements, we continue 
to work with our pilots and their unions on new deals, similar to this one concluded with BALPA, and have 
successfully re-negotiated improved long-term agreements with 70% of our pilots, running until 2026 or 2027 as we 
prioritise pay restoration," Hughes concluded.

(Alliance News) - More than 50 Ryanair Holdings PLC flights to and from Spain were cancelled on Thursday and 
several hundred others delayed during a strike by the low-cost airline's cabin staff. 
The strike which took place as European schools were breaking up for the summer was the latest stoppage by 
European airline staff demanding better conditions. 
By 8:00 pm, 54 flights had been cancelled and more than 300 delayed, with the airports in Barcelona and Malaga 
worst-hit, the USO union said. 
Although Ryanair had said all scheduled flights would be operating, the airline "had not called in the full crew" at 
certain airports.
"The crew members that were not called in have joined the strike while those that were, went to the airports.. but 
there were not enough of them to operate the flights," it said. 
The strike by Ryanair cabin crew in Spain, where there are some 1,900 employees, is affecting 10 of the airline 
bases in the country and is due to run until July 2.
Earlier, the airline said flight disruption through the strike was "minimal" and only affected three percent of its 
Spanish flights.
The employees, who are demanding better working conditions, began an initial three-day strike on June 24 during 
which 129 Spanish flights were cancelled, the union said. 
Ryanair is the airline that transports the most passengers in the Spanish market, offering more than 650 routes to 
27 airports, the company says. 
The initial strike in Spain coincided with industrial action by the airline's staff in Portugal, Belgium, Italy and France 
demanding respect for labour rights and higher wages.

On Friday, staff with rival low-cost airline EasyJet will also be striking for the first of three weekends in July

CONSUMER champion Which? has called for a significant overhaul of travel rules to hold airlines accountable 
when they flaunt consumer laws.
The call comes at a delicate time for the aviation industry, which has been plagued for the last few weeks by a raft 
of cancellations and delays.
Which? today called on the government to expand the powers given to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), so that it 
could hit airlines that break the law with hefty fines.
The group also suggested setting an airline code of conduct as well as making it mandatory for carriers to sign up to 
alternative dispute resolution schemes (ADR).
Under the current legislation, airlines and airports are not obliged to sign up to the ADR system, forcing travellers to 
go through lengthy court proceedings if they want to enforce their rights.
The appeal is based on an investigation by the consumer group, in which several airlines - including Ryanair, BA 
and TUI - were accused of breaking the law.
Carriers rebutted condemning Which?'s "unfounded and unsupported" allegations.
Commenting on the news, aviation analyst Sally Gethin said the government and CAA were already working on 
consumer protection measures.

Ryanair has announced its biggest ever Birmingham winter schedule, with an additional based aircraft for 
winter'22/23 and 5 new routes to exciting destinations such as Billund, Grenoble, Santander, Stockholm, and 
Toulouse to recognise 35 years at Birmingham Airport.
Ryanair's Birmingham based fleet will increase to 5 based aircraft, 2 of which will be new Boeing 737 8-200 
"Gamechanger" aircraft which deliver 4% more seats, burn 16% less fuel, and create 40% less noise emissions.
Ryanair's investment of over USD$500m at Birmingham will support 150 highly paid aviation jobs and over 1,850 
indirect jobs in the local area.
Ryanair's Birmingham winter'22 schedule will deliver:
5 based aircraft - 2 of which will be Boeing 737 8-200 "Gamechanger" aircraft
USD$500m investment in Birmingham
34 routes in total - 5 new: Billund, Grenoble, Santander, Stockholm, and Toulouse
Over 280 flights per week
Over 2,000 total jobs
Ryanair are operating a full schedule this summer across the UK and continues to invest and grow its network into 
winter '22, unlike other airlines who cannot operate their promised schedules efficiently and continue to disappoint 
UK holidaymakers.
Ryanair is leading the post-pandemic recovery across Europe with the help of traffic recovery schemes and lower 
airport charges. If the UK is to continue its recovery, the government needs to immediately support airlines by 
scrapping the aviation tax (APD) now in full, a 50% cut on domestic flights from April'23 is simply insufficient.
With 34 routes to choose from this winter, Birmingham customers and visitors can already book a well-deserved 
winter getaway, flying on the lowest fares to exciting new destinations such Billund, Grenoble, Santander, 
Ryanair celebrates 35 years at Birmingham and announces its winter schedule '22/23
Stockholm, and Toulouse. To celebrate its 35th birthday at Birmingham and an additional based aircraft, Ryanair 
has launched a seat sale with fares available from just £19.99 which must be booked by Friday, 1st of July for travel 
from October'22 - March'23, only on the Ryanair.com website.
From Birmingham, Ryanair Director of Route Development, Ray Kelliher said:
"Ryanair is delighted to announce further growth and investment at our Birmingham base this winter, with our 5th 
based aircraft, 5 exciting new routes and 2 brand new environmentally efficient Boeing 8-200 "Gamechanger" 
aircraft as we celebrate 35 years of successful operations at Birmingham Airport. Our now biggest ever Birmingham 
base will deliver 34 routes for Winter'22, including 5 new routes to destinations such as Billund, Grenoble, 
Santander, Stockholm, and Toulouse.
Lower aviation taxes and competitive airport charges provide the foundation for which Ryanair can deliver long-term 
traffic growth and increased connectivity. At a time when other airlines across the UK are cancelling flights and 
reducing their schedules, we're delighted to make this $100m further investment in Birmingham largely thanks to 
the hard work and support of the Airport. If the UK Government wants to see more investments from Ryanair and 
other airlines next Summer, they must scrap the APD tax for all flights, or otherwise put the UK (an island-based 
economy) at risk of losing air traffic to competing European countries.
To celebrate today's announcement and our 35th birthday at Birmingham, we are launching a seat sale with fares 
available from £19.99 for travel from October'22 until March'23, which must be booked by Friday, 1st July. Since 
these amazing low fares will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and book early to 
avoid missing out."
Birmingham Airport Chief Executive, Nick Barton said:

Ryanair has announced its biggest ever Birmingham winter schedule, with an additional based aircraft for 
winter'22/23 and 5 new routes to exciting destinations such as Billund, Grenoble, Santander, Stockholm, and 
Toulouse to recognise 35 years at Birmingham Airport.
Ryanair's Birmingham based fleet will increase to 5 based aircraft, 2 of which will be new Boeing 737 8-200 
"Gamechanger" aircraft which deliver 4% more seats, burn 16% less fuel, and create 40% less noise emissions.
Ryanair's investment of over USD$500m at Birmingham will support 150 highly paid aviation jobs and over 1,850 
indirect jobs in the local area.
Ryanair's Birmingham winter'22 schedule will deliver:
5 based aircraft - 2 of which will be Boeing 737 8-200 "Gamechanger" aircraft
USD$500m investment in Birmingham
34 routes in total - 5 new: Billund, Grenoble, Santander, Stockholm, and Toulouse
Over 280 flights per week
Over 2,000 total jobs
Ryanair are operating a full schedule this summer across the UK and continues to invest and grow its network into 
winter '22, unlike other airlines who cannot operate their promised schedules efficiently and continue to disappoint 
UK holidaymakers.
Ryanair is leading the post-pandemic recovery across Europe with the help of traffic recovery schemes and lower 
airport charges. If the UK is to continue its recovery, the government needs to immediately support airlines by 
scrapping the aviation tax (APD) now in full, a 50% cut on domestic flights from April'23 is simply insufficient.
With 34 routes to choose from this winter, Birmingham customers and visitors can already book a well-deserved 
winter getaway, flying on the lowest fares to exciting new destinations such Billund, Grenoble, Santander, 
Ryanair celebrates 35 years at Birmingham and announces its winter schedule '22/23
Stockholm, and Toulouse. To celebrate its 35th birthday at Birmingham and an additional based aircraft, Ryanair 
has launched a seat sale with fares available from just £19.99 which must be booked by Friday, 1st of July for travel 
from October'22 - March'23, only on the Ryanair.com website.
From Birmingham, Ryanair Director of Route Development, Ray Kelliher said:
"Ryanair is delighted to announce further growth and investment at our Birmingham base this winter, with our 5th 
based aircraft, 5 exciting new routes and 2 brand new environmentally efficient Boeing 8-200 "Gamechanger" 
aircraft as we celebrate 35 years of successful operations at Birmingham Airport. Our now biggest ever Birmingham 
base will deliver 34 routes for Winter'22, including 5 new routes to destinations such as Billund, Grenoble, 
Santander, Stockholm, and Toulouse.
Lower aviation taxes and competitive airport charges provide the foundation for which Ryanair can deliver long-term 
traffic growth and increased connectivity. At a time when other airlines across the UK are cancelling flights and 
reducing their schedules, we're delighted to make this $100m further investment in Birmingham largely thanks to 
the hard work and support of the Airport. If the UK Government wants to see more investments from Ryanair and 
other airlines next Summer, they must scrap the APD tax for all flights, or otherwise put the UK (an island-based 
economy) at risk of losing air traffic to competing European countries.
To celebrate today's announcement and our 35th birthday at Birmingham, we are launching a seat sale with fares 
available from £19.99 for travel from October'22 until March'23, which must be booked by Friday, 1st July. Since 
these amazing low fares will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and book early to 
avoid missing out."
Birmingham Airport Chief Executive, Nick Barton said:

Airport fix puts spotlight on landing slot system
Airport fix puts spotlight on landing slot system
Financial Times (London, England)

T he aviation industry sometimes feels like one titanic struggle between the various groups it takes to get 
passengers through security, on to an aircraft and to their destination safely with, if possible, their bags.
Yet the stand-off over the regulator's decision to cut landing fees at Heathrow lacked its usual drama. Everyone 
read from the standard script, with airlines arguing for more cuts and Heathrow wailing that this would hit 
investment.
But last year's concern that higher charges, which are passed on to travellers, would dent the post-pandemic 
recovery in air travel seems laughably historic. Demand has surged with the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. Fares 
booked 14 days before departure have already jumped 33 per cent on last year, according to Eurocontrol.
Airlines and airports cannot find enough staff willing to do difficult, lowpaid jobs involving antisocial hours to provide 
an acceptable service. Schedules are now being cut in response.
It is, in the words of industry consultant John Strickland, "one big mess. Everyone is just trying to get through it."
One tool to survive the summer was provided by the government last week: airlines have two weeks to choose to 
hand back up to 30 per cent of their summer capacity without risking losing those prized slots next year. (Slots are 
the right to use airport infrastructure at a particular time.)
Airport fix puts spotlight on landing slot system
The use it or lose it system, which usually requires flying a slot reliably 80 per cent of the time to avoid it going to a 
rival, still hadn't returned to normal after the pandemic. Then rules were lifted to avoid empty planes churning out 
CO2 to keep slots. A threshold of 70 per cent had been set for the UK this summer (and will apply to whatever the 
airlines choose to keep running).
Letting airlines take an axe to their service without penalty is probably a necessary evil. The government says this 
should avoid the last-minute cancellations and airport scenes of recent weeks. Airlines have pointed the finger at 
the government over the early end to furlough support before travel bans were lifted. EasyJet, which trimmed its 
summer schedule, said it had to reject 8,000 overseas applicants thanks to post-Brexit immigration rules.
Neither side benefits from more chaos. But it creates the impression that airlines that either cut hardest in the 
pandemic or called the recovery wrong now benefit most from the slot "amnesty". The free option to hand back slots 
is anti-competitive. It reduces seats this summer, pushes up fares and restricts new entrants next year, notes 
analyst Sean Moulton.
It's probably unrealistic to think that rivals can swoop in and run services near-term, not least because everyone is 
struggling for staff. But airlines such as Ryanair that bore the costs of keeping staff and planes on in the pandemic 
have fared markedly better than others in the industry restart.
The government move is a big, blunt instrument compared with the solutions the industry itself was producing. 
Heathrow in April agreed with airlines to shift times rather than cut flights to reduce peak congestion.
Gatwick this month struck a deal to limit capacity in July and August: that cut flights by 5 to 10 per cent, compared 
with the government's option to slash 30 per cent. Smaller, less congested airports may suffer from the blanket 
option to prune schedules.
What is clear is that we have had two episodes where the business of defending slots has produced decidedly odd 
results: first, the flying of empty planes in the pandemic; now, the continuation of services doomed to produce awful 
customer experiences.
And all this from a set-up that the competition regulator in 2018 said produced inefficient outcomes, hurt new 
entrants and smaller airlines and could mean poorer services and higher fares.
This year may be all about getting through. But the price of flexibility should be a proper look at whether the slot 
system is fit to fly.

 Long-haul flights are a necessary evil[1] and I was intrigued this week to see Air New Zealand is launching the 
world's first sleep pods for economy class travellers. 
This is a rare bit of good news for aviation[2] design. I'm still smarting from Ryanair's idea to remove toilets from 
planes[3] and its Skyrider[4] concept, a 'standing seat' from the pits of hell. 
It's baaaaaack! The AvioInteriors Skyrider saddle seat is returning to #AIX18[5] after its controversial reception. Will 
the fact that 28' is normal on low-cost carriers mean that a 23' squat for a (very) short flight seems more #PaxEx[6] 
palatable? #avgeek[7] pic.twitter.com/zLylr91NiT[8]

Hi there, EV nerd! Subscribe now for a weekly recap of our favorite mobility stories 
Fortunately, it's not all bad. There are plenty of people designing airplane interiors with passenger comfort in mind. 
Here are some of the latest (and greatest) ideas: 
Sleep pods https://thenextweb.com /news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-aircraft-design#Fly Air 
New Zealand and you get to lie flat in a pod. Image: Air New Zealand[10]; 
When you fly long-haul, all you want to do is lie flat. And now you can — all without shelling out for tickets you need 
a mortgage for. 
Yes, I'm talking about Air New Zealand's sleep pods. Each bunk-bed unit has its own mattress, sheets, privacy 
curtain, USB charging, and ventilation. 
However, the pods are communal, and the passengers can only book a pod for four hours. 
Worse, there are only six pods per plane. A plane flies about 200 passengers, so assuming they service about 24 
over several four-hour shifts, there will be 176 other passengers who are mightily pissed off that they didn't get a 
booking. 
Just wait for the air rage, people.

The cloud capsule is designed to increase passenger comfort while making the airline more money. 
The pay-extra capsules sit above the outboard aisles and can be used to sleep, relax, or focus on work in a private 
setting.

So it's a bit like having people sleeping in an overhead locker. Or you can just lie there and feel the burning 
resentment of those unfortunate enough to be sitting underneath you. A touch creepy, but it's not like I'd say no. 
SpaceChiller 
https://thenextweb.com/news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-aircraft-
design#SpaceChiller gives you your very own mini bar. Image credit: Collins Aerospace[12] 
SpaceChiller by Collins Aerospace[12] is a personal mini-bar requiring half the power of traditional designs. 
SpaceChiller uses advanced heat sinks, initially developed by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency 
(DARPA), reducing power consumption by up to 50% over alternate thermoelectric systems and can be leveraged 
across multiple service areas and passenger seats. 
I love the idea of not having to ask for a drink at 3 AM when I'm deep into bingeing whatever nonsense the airline 
has decided I must watch. Bring it on. 
Elevate 
cabins 
https://thenextweb.com/news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-aircraft-
design#Luxury you don't even have at home. Image credit: Teague[13]  
Imagine a cabin with natural materials and 'floating furniture' attached to wall braces so you can easily store stuff 
under it. Designed by Teague[13] and NORDAM, the design gets thumbs up space without removing seat capacity. 
The downside, of course, is that you likely need some serious coin to be able to afford to use it, but I can dream. 
Chaise Longue Airplane Seat https://thenextweb.com/news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-
aircraft-design#This prototype design looks a bit like a torture chamber, sorry. Credit: Crystal Cabin Award [14] 
You can blame Delft Technical University for this design. It's the brainchild of graduate student Alejandro Núñez 
Vicente who told CNN Travel[15] of his goal to 'change the economy class seats for the better of humanity, or for all 
the people that cannot afford to pay for more expensive tickets.' 
Lofty ambition or masochistic design? 
I like the under-storage for those seated above, and I'm short enough that being that close to the ceiling in an upper 
seat wouldn't bother me. But I dislike my chance of staying upright when stepping down — especially after a few gin 
and tonics. 
But while some marvel at Núñez Vicente's innovation, the internet is divided, with posters on Reddit[16] concerned 
about ease of evacuation, the risk of breaking your knees, and claustrophobia for the lower passenger. One 
commenter declared: 'just sedate me and put me in a drawer already' 
Vincente is apparently in talks with investors and airlines. 
The Coffee House Cabin https://thenextweb.com/news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-aircraft-
design#When airplane meets workspace. Credit: Crystal Cabin awards[14]  
This design is a winner from last year's Crystal Cabin awards[14] in the University student category, but I dig it, so I 
decided to share it with you. 
A long table runs down the center of the cabin, creating a handy space for remote work, meetings, and coffee 
drinking. Imagine it. You can open your laptop without fear that the moron in front of you will push their seat back 
and break it. 
While most of these ideas are more in the design than the commercial phase, what's clear is that flying[17] - 
especially luxury aviation[18] - is still incredibly popular. As we create new aircraft modes, we need new cabin 
interiors, and these designs might be the start of something amazing.

Airline giant Lufthansa is planning to cut more than 3,000 flights this summer due to staff shortages and strikes.
The news comes as a second wave of announcements is confirmed on Thursday, and currently relates to 2,200 
flights - or 3 per cent of those scheduled.
The company already cut back 5 per cent of summer flights on Fridays and weekends, including 900 connections. It 
said this was due to "bottlenecks and [a] shortage of personnel, [meaning] the entire European aviation sector 
suffers".
Lufthansa's own low-cost carrier, Eurowings, also announced "several hundred fewer flights" in July.
The staff shortages are occurring at "airports, ground services [and] aviation security," explains the company in a 
press release sent to AFP. Lufthansa reported an increase in sick leave over the last few days.
"Strikes among air traffic controllers, the weather and above all an increase in COVID-19 infections" are cited as the 
cause.
As a result, the group is cutting 2,200 out of 80,000 flights to and from the hubs of Frankfurt and Munich, mainly 
domestic and intra-European routes.
The cancellations are no longer just at weekends - but also weekdays too.
The move has been deemed "inevitable" and means there must be more stability throughout the summer in order to 
avoid an "overload of ground processes during peak hours", explains the group.
Since health restrictions have been lifted in many countries, most notably in the UK, airlines have faced difficulties 
in meeting the surge in demand, mainly due to severe labour shortages.
In the UK, airports have been severely disrupted for months, with long queues and cancellations from Easyjet, 
Ryanair, British Airways, Tui or Wizz Air.
Lufthansa is the latest European airline to cancel thousands of flights at the last minute
London's Gatwick Airport announced last week that it would limit the number of daily flights in July and August, in 
an attempt to avoid further chaos.

Jun 28, 2022( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Swedish loss-making airline SAS is fighting for survival, the latest carrier to hit financial straits due to hefty debts, 
stiff competition and soaring costs, even as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic. 
SAS has said a restructuring plan announced in February depends on it raising 9.5 billion Swedish crowns ($946 
million)in cash and converting 20 billion crowns of debt to equity. 
Many governments across the world helped shore up their national carriers during the pandemic. But Sweden and 
Denmark, which both have 21.8% stakes in SAS, are taking very different approaches to the Scandinavian brand. 
Denmark has said it is willing to increase its ownership and write off debt, but Sweden has refused to inject more 
money. 
WHY DOES SAS MATTER SO MUCH TO DENMARK? 
SAS AB, formally known as Scandinavian Airlines System Denmark - Norway - Sweden, is headquartered in 
Stockholm, but it uses Copenhagen Airport, the largest in Scandinavia, as its main hub. 
Denmark's Finance Minister Nicolai Wammen has said SAS is important for the Danish economy and ensuring 
good travel connections from the Nordic country to the rest of Europe as well as long-distance flights to other 
continents. 
SAS directly employs almost 7,000 people, equally shared between Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Prior to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the company underpinned 20,000 jobs in the Scandinavian region, 6,800 of those in 
Denmark, according to a 2019 report by Copenhagen Economics commissioned by SAS. 
SAS accounted for almost a third of direct and indirect flights to Denmark, according to the report. It also accounted 
for 82% of transfer air traffic at Copenhagen airport in 2017. 
To Danes, SAS has traditionally been linked to a sense of pride and even a collective sense of ownership as it 
evolved to become a leading premium carrier in the decades following its creation in 1946. 
WHAT HAS GONE WRONG? 
At its height in the 1980s, SAS was named the world's best airline by an industry group. But with the emergence of 
low-cost rivals such as Ryanair things began to change. 
The company has been in nearly constant financial trouble since the turn of the century, and last year lost 6.5 billion 
Swedish crowns ($638 million), with revenue just a third of pre-pandemic levels. 
On consumer review site Trustpilot, SAS is rated 1.5 out of five stars, just above Ryanair's 1.4. 
Explainer-Why The Survival Of Scandinavian Airline SAS Hinges On Denmark
Adding to SAS' trouble, some 1,000 SAS pilots in Denmark, Norway and Sweden plan to go on strike on June 29 
over disagreements over wages and cost-cutting plans. 
WHAT DOES DENMARK WANT? 
Denmark's parliament agreed this month to write off some of SAS' debt and convert some more into equity, as well 
as to inject new cash. That could increase Copenhagen's stake in the airline to up to 30%. 
But the government has made it a condition of the cash injection that SAS gets private investors to participate too. 
IS THIS A PROBLEM? 
While the Danish government has promised to stay out of day-to-day business, it wants to protect its interests. 
Denmark wants "influence over the elements in SAS that are central to maintaining SAS' strong foothold in 
Denmark and contribution to Denmark's international accessibility," the finance ministry said this month. 
That may deter large investors and consortia that might have been interested in making sweeping changes at SAS, 
according to Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen. 
WHAT IS SWEDEN DOING? 
Sweden, which has already injected more than 8 billion Swedish crowns into SAS over recent decades, has taken a 
harder line on new financing. 
Stockholm said this month it would not provide new cash to SAS, though it approved the debt-for-equity plan. 
If the airline does raise new equity, this will reduce Sweden's stake. The country has said it wants to exit SAS 
completely in the long term. 
HOW ABOUT NORWAY? 
Neighbouring Norway's government sold its remaining 10% stake in SAS in 2018, arguing there was no need for 
the state to own airline stocks. 
Still, it is a major creditor with 1.5 billion Norwegian crowns ($153 million) in loans made during the pandemic. 
On Tuesday, Oslo said it would support SAS' debt-to-equity plan, under certain conditions, but did not plan to 
remain a long-term stakeholder.

Jun 28, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, both Frontier Group Holdings ULCC[1] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] as interested parties 
sweetened their respective offers for buying Spirit Airlines SAVE[3]. The moves made just ahead of SAVE's 
shareholder vote on Jun 30, are aimed at wooing its shareholders. 
Per Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] management, strikes by its cabin crew members in certain European countries 
over the weekend did not have any meaningful impact on its operations. In all probability, pilots of Chicago-based 
United Airlines UAL[5] will get significant pay hikes over the next 18 months. 
With labor problems hurting the U.S. airline industry, the approval of a tentative two-year agreement covering about 
14,000 pilots at UAL is certainly a huge positive. Like UAL, Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska 
Air Group ALK[6], too received encouraging tidings on the labor front when it reached a provisional pay-related 
agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Recap of the Latest Top 
Stories 1.Per the latest offer from Frontier, ULCC increased its per-share cash consideration by $2 to $4.13, 
payable to Spirit Airlines' shareholders. This is in addition to 1.9126 Frontier shares that ULCC had agreed to pay 
previously. ULCC will also prepay $2.22 per share to SAVE's shareholders as cash dividend upon approval of the 
transaction. Frontier also increased its reverse termination fee by $100 million to $350 million, payable to Spirit 
Airlines in case the deal fails to materialize due to antitrust concerns[7]. 
Not to be left behind, JetBlue, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),came up with an improved offer to buy 
SAVE. Per the enhanced offer, JetBlue will prepay $2.50 per share as cash dividend to SAVE's shareholders soon 
after they vote in favor of the deal. This is higher than the prepayment of $1.50 per share agreed upon previously. 
JBLU has also increased the reverse break-up fee to $400 million from the previous $350 million, payable to Spirit 
Airlines in case the deal falls through due to antitrust concerns. JetBlue's improved proposal also includes a ticking 
fee to provide Spirit Airlines shareholders with a monthly prepayment of 10 cents per share between January 2023 
and the closing or termination of the deal. This increases the transaction value to $34.15 per share. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. UAL's pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, Int'l (ALPA), approved a tentative agreement on 
modified terms for their collective bargaining deal. The United Master Executive Council represents 14,000 
professional pilots at UAL. The provisional agreement will now be sent for ratification. The voting procedure must be 
Airline Stock Roundup: Pay Hike Likely for UAL Pilots, SAVE Takeover Saga & More
complete by Jul 15. The provisional deal will be valid only if the voting result is favorable. On successful ratification, 
the TA will generate an additional value of $1.3 billion for the United Airlines pilots over the two-year long 
agreement. 
Under the terms of the agreement, pilots will get three pay-rate raises totaling more than 14.5% within 18 months, 
retroactive to the commencement of the current year. The deal also includes a new eight-week paid maternity leave 
benefit, better overtime and premium pay, a new retirement plan and improved scheduling provisions, among other 
benefits.[9] 
3. At Alaska Airlines, the tentative deal covers 5,300 employees, including those who work at the ramp, stores, 
clerical, office and passenger service for the Seattle, WA-based airline. However, the deal does not cover roughly 
2,000 ramp workers, also represented by IAM, who work for the McGee Air Services subsidiary and handle 
baggage on passenger flights. The four-year deal, on materialization, will make the 5,300 employees eligible for a 
substantial pay raise. Salient features of the contract include higher base wage rates for all classifications in the 
8.9-17.4% band, effective Aug 10, 2022. The employees will be eligible for a further 2.5% hike in all base wage 
rates for all classifications from the same date of 2023. Base wage rate will also increase 2.5% for the following two 
years. The existing job security clause (amendable on Sep 27, 2026) is extended to Sep 27, 2028[10]. 
4. Per aReuters report[11], strikes by RYAAY's cabin crew in various European nations did not leave much impact 
on the airline's operations. Per management, "Less than 2% of Ryanair's 9,000 flights operating this weekend 
(24/25/26 June) have been affected by minor and poorly supported crew strikes". Cabin crew members in Spain are 
scheduled to go on a strike again for three days starting Jun 30. That RYAAY would face strikes by its cabin crew 
over the weekend was mentioned in the previous week's write-up[12]. Performance The following table shows the 
price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that almost all the airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week. The NYSE 
ARCA Airline Index has increased 2.6% to $57.74. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
plummeted 29.1%. What's Next in the Airline Space? All eyes will be on Spirit Airlines shareholders' vote scheduled 
for Jun 30. The outcome of Thursday's vote should bring down the curtains on the bidding war for SAVE.

Russian jailed after forced Ryanair landing asks Minsk for clemency
Russian jailed after forced Ryanair landing asks Minsk for clemency

A prominent critic of the Belarusian government, who hit the headlines when she and her then-partner were 
removed from a Ryanair plane forced to land in Minsk, has petitioned for clemency after more than a year in 
custody, according to a media report.
According to the BBC's Russian-language service, Sofia Sapega wrote that her support for the Belarusian 
opposition was attributable to "youth and stupidity." The Russian national also wrote that she now recognized the 
movement's lawlessness and illegitimacy.
It is unclear under what circumstances she wrote the plea.
Belarus was rocked by protests in 2020 after election results that returned Alexander Lukasehnko to the presidency 
were widely derided as fixed. Authorities cracked down hard on the protest movement, with many jailed and others 
fleeing the country.
One who fled was blogger Roman Protasevich. However, he was taken into custody in 2021 after a flight he was 
on, travelling from Athens to Vilnius, was forced to land in Belarus after officials there cited a bomb threat.
Sapega was also on the plane and taken into custody. She was sentenced to six years because she was 
responsible for an opposition news channel on the Telegram messaging service.
The incident prompted an airspace ban from the European Union, which had already laid sanctions on Belarus due 
to allegations of election tampering. Officials were especially angered by the fact that the flight was between two 
EU countries, but was still rerouted.
Protasevich, who operated the opposition Telegram channel Nexta, has also apologized for his prior government 
opposition in jailhouse interviews. Opposition members say Protasevich's new comments were likely coerced.

Helsinki Vantaa), after Europe's Luxembourg-based General Court said it had dismissed its action in its entirety.
In June 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on every airline, the European Commission cleared the 
Finnish government's plans to contribute to the flag carrier's recapitalisation by subscribing to new shares in a rights 
issue to the tune of EUR286 million euros (USD326 million at the time).
The antitrust regulator had justified this by saying: "Finnair ensures the essential domestic and international 
connectivity needs of Finland. Given the geographical location of the country, the national economy, many jobs, and 
the development of foreign trade rely on these services."
Ryanair launched legal action against the commission on the grounds that it had neglected to initiate a formal 
investigation into the aid despite doubts it should have had about the compatibility of the aid with the rules of the 
EU's internal market. According to the low-cost carrier, the commission had infringed the principles of equal 
treatment.
However, Europe's second-highest court took the side of the competition regulators.
"The commission was entitled to approve the recapitalisation of Finnair, carried out by its public and private owners 
on a pro rata basis in proportion to the previously existing ownership structure, without initiating the formal 
investigation procedure," the June 22 ruling summarised.
The bloc had adopted a temporary framework loosening its rules on state aid a few days after the start of member 
countries' first lockdown measures, "in order to allow those states to act with the urgency that the situation 
demanded," it pointed out. The court added that the new shares had been "offered at a sufficiently large price 
discount for the view to be taken that Finland has received sufficient remuneration." Further, the measure sought 
"as far as possible to maintain the entirety of Finnair's operations and did not target particular routes."
The judgement came after Ryanair lost a separate challenge in April 2021 against a Finnish state loan guarantee 
for Finnair. But it has won cases against Dutch assistance handed to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Portuguese 
support for TAP Air Portugal - though it has lost appeals against aid for Austrian Airlines, Condor, and SAS 
Finnair aid cleared as Ryanair loses legal challenge
Scandinavian Airlines. With this latest ruling, it now has the option of lodging an appeal with Europe's highest court, 
the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Approached for comment, a Ryanair spokesperson told ch-aviation that "while the Covid-19 crisis has caused 
damage to all airlines that contribute to the economy and the connectivity of Finland, the Finnish government 
decided to support only its flag carrier. One of the EU's greatest achievements is the creation of a true single 
market for air transport. The European Commission's approval of the Finnish recapitalisation aid to Finnair went 
against the fundamental principles of EU law. Today's judgement sets the process of liberalisation in air transport 
back by 30 years by allowing Finland to give its national flag carrier a leg up over more efficient competitors, based 
purely on nationality."

Jet2holidays could emerge with heightened reputation amid UK airline crisis
Jet2holidays could emerge with heightened reputation amid UK airline crisis

Highlight: As staffing issues, strikes, delays and cancellations continue to hinder the day-to-day operations of 
some of the UK's leading tour operators and airlines, Jet2holidays could actually gain a competitive edge in Britain's 
travel market.
Body
The UK-based tour operator has not seen the same level of media scrutiny as the likes of TUI, easyJet Holidays, 
British Airways and Ryanair. As such, many customers could look to the Which? recommended brand as the 
industry gears up for the winter 2022/2023 season. 
Jet2holidays has an opportunity to attract disappointed travelers After a tumultuous 24 months for the travel 
industry, consumer expectations going into 2022 were high. According to a GlobalData poll from January 2022*, 
38.2% of respondents said they intended to take an international trip to a different continent, and a further 28.8% 
said they were willing to travel internationally within their continent. These poll results highlight the improving 
sentiment towards global travel in 2022. This has put significant pressure on tour operators and airlines in the UK 
as many do not have the staffing capacity to meet this demand, with many employees laid off during the pandemic. 
Many consumers believed that the effects of the pandemic had subsided and had not anticipated the operational 
struggles and logistical issues facing airlines as a result. Nevertheless, problems are wide-ranging for the UK airline 
industry and cover areas such as labor, operational overheads, fuel costs and even catering issues. This has 
resulted in a diminished customer experience, mainly through some of the UK's busiest airports, where last-minute 
cancellations and long delays have now become commonplace. These have affected a myriad airlines and tour 
operators. Consequently, consumer confidence will be damaged significantly, especially for those who have 
experienced cancellations to their eagerly anticipated holidays at short notice. However, during this time, 
Jet2holidays has managed to keep a relatively low profile, with passengers generally experiencing unavoidable 
airport delays and catering issues for the most part. Whilst disappointing, coverage of competitors' problems has 
received far greater attention. As such, Jet2 could potentially gain a competitive edge over its rivals as a more 
reliable alternative. Its performance during the pandemic also supports this, receiving praise from top UK consumer 
watchdogs Money Saving Expert and Which? for the way it handled the COVID-19 crisis. Challenges still lie ahead 
for Jet2holidays The issues facing the UK airline industry will not be resolved overnight. The staffing issues 
Jet2holidays could emerge with heightened reputation amid UK airline crisis
experienced by airports and airlines will directly impact companies such as Jet2holidays, who have been able to 
manage demand more effectively. Therefore, some level of overcrowding at security and flight delays will be 
unavoidable. Subsequently, it will be impossible for Jet2holidays to satisfy all its customers. However, proactive, 
and timely information will be essential in managing consumer expectations. Learning from the experiences of their 
competitors will also be imperative to their success. The demand for international travel remains high, but consumer 
confidence has taken a hit, which could be problematic for the UK travel industry's recovery. However, in times of 
difficulty, there is often an opportunity for businesses to enhance their reputation and win new customers, and 
Jet2holidays is in a prime position to achieve this.

Greece's capacity recovery from the COVID-19 crisis has outpaced the recovery in Europe as a whole.
In the week of 13-Jun-2022, Greece has 112% of its 2019 capacity levels, compared with a European average of 
86%. Greece is at a higher percentage than any other top 10 European country by seats.
However, the leading Greek operator - Aegean Airlines Group - has taken a slightly more cautious approach, 
reaching 95%.
The number two operator, Ryanair Group, is at 131% in Greece, and low cost airlines are at 148% in aggregate.
Aegean's fleet plan indicates a 2026 fleet at the same size as in 2021.
Meanwhile, LCCs are likely to continue to grow and to take seat share away from Aegean.

Cabin Crew Strikes Have Minimal Effect on Ryanair (RYAAY)
Cabin Crew Strikes Have Minimal Effect on Ryanair (RYAAY)

Jun 27, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shares of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] have declined 27.6% year to date as the stock is mired in multiple 
headwinds. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Apart from high fuel costs, labor woes are plaguing this European carrier, which currently carries a Zacks Rank # 5 
(Strong Sell). The negativity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year 
earnings being revised 10.1% downward over the past 60 days. 
Highlighting the labor woes, RYAAY's cabin crew in some European countries like Belgium, Spain and Italy went on 
strike over the weekend. The cabin crew unions accused the Irish carrier of being insensitive toward local labor 
laws pertaining to minimum wage and working conditions. 
However, per a Reuters report[2], the strikes in various European nations did not leave much impact on the airline's 
operations. Per management, "Less than 2% of Ryanair's 9,000 flights operating this weekend (24/25/26 June) 
have been affected by minor and poorly supported crew strikes". Cabin crew members in Spain are scheduled to go 
on a strike again for three days starting Jun 30. 
RYAAY will be hoping that the impending strikes may also not affect its operations as was the case this weekend. 
This is because if the strikes work, then RYAAY's plans of attracting a significant traffic during the summer may 
take a hit. 
Driven by elevated traffic, RYAAY expects load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) readings to be impressive 
this summer. Watch this space for further updates on this key issue. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks 
in the broader ZacksTransportation[3]sector are Ryder System R[4],C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW[5] andGATX 
Corporation GATX[6]. 
Ryderhas a trailing-four quarter surprise of 48.2%, on average, with its earnings having surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters.R is benefiting from improving economic and freight conditions in 
the United States. 
Revenues in all segments grew (on higher rental revenues, new business and favorable pricing) in first-quarter 
2022. R currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here.[7] 
Cabin Crew Strikes Have Minimal Effect on Ryanair (RYAAY)
The expected long-term (three-to-five years) earnings per share growth rate forC.H. Robinsonis pegged at 
9%.Better freight market conditions are aiding CHRW. 
In first-quarter 2022, the top line improved 41.8% owing to favorable truckload pricing for customers and handsome 
profits in ocean freight. CHRW currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. 
GATXhas a trailing-four quarter surprise of 40.1%, on average, with its earnings having surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters. 
The gradual improvement in the North American railcar leasing market is a boon for GATX. GATX currently has a 
Zacks Rank of 2.

 Air traffic is booming this summer, but after European vacations are over will passenger demand hold up? 
The question was the focus of the annual congress of the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe in Rome this 
week, held at the cusp of the approaching peak season. 
The summer period is shaping up to be by far the best since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis that has 
severely affected the airline industry since 2020. 
Some airlines, such as Ryanair, and countries, in particular Greece, have already recovered or even exceeded their 
2019 daily flight numbers, according to Eurocontrol, a pan-European air traffic agency. 
Across the continent, air traffic was last week at 86 percent of the same period in 2019, Eurocontrol said, and 
expected to reach up to 95 percent in August under its most optimistic estimate. 
And companies are filling seats for the coming weeks despite the sharp rise in ticket prices, long lines in various 
airports from Frankfurt to Dublin to Amsterdam and strikes by flight attendants, pilots or air traffic controllers. 
But after that? 
"Visibility is low because there is a lot of uncertainty," said Olivier Jankovec, director general of ACI Europe. 
"We're now in a war economy in Europe, we have the prospect of a quite harsh recession, we have inflation at 
record levels, so how all of this is going to play into consumer sentiment... the jury's still out." 
The director general for transport and mobility at the European Commission, Henrik Hololei, echoed that thought. 
"We really need to tighten the seatbelt because there's going to be a lot of turbulence," he told delegates. 
"We are entering... a period of uncertainty which we have never experienced in the last decade. And that of course 
is the biggest enemy of the business," he said.

Hololei listed the war in Ukraine, high energy prices and shortages of energy, food and labour. 
"We have also interest rates which are going up for the first time in a decade," he said. 
The price of jet fuel has doubled over the past year, with a refinery capacity shortage compounding the explosion in 
crude oil prices. 
Fuel accounts for about a quarter of the operating costs of airlines, which have passed them on to consumers in 
ticket prices as they seek to refill coffers drained by the two-year health crisis. 
Despite Strong Summer Start, Europe's Aviation Industry Frets
Still, strong demand has returned, confirmed Eleni Kaloyirou, managing director of Hermes Airports, which 
manages the airports of Larnaca and Paphos in Cyprus, where the high tourist season extends into November. 
"People want to take their holidays," she said, acknowledging, however, "we do worry about next year". 
The general manager of Athens International Airport, Yiannis Paraschis, similarly expressed fears that "the increase 
in energy costs and inflation will consume a great part of European households' disposable income". 
The head of Istanbul International Airport, Kadri Samsunlu, voiced concerns about inflation's effect in Western 
Europe. 
And if consumer confidence is damaged, "We don't know what's going to happen to the demand," he warned. 
The last unknown hanging over European air travel in the medium term is a possible new outbreak of coronavirus. 
"Covid has not disappeared, and it is not a seasonal flu either," Hololei warned.

 Britain's railway system once again came to a virtual standstill on Saturday and flights in Europe were disrupted as 
strikes in the travel sector hit the continent. 
Tens of thousands of rail workers in the UK staged the latest day-long walkout over pay and job security, hampering 
weekend plans for those already hit by similar strikes on Tuesday and Thursday. 
Only around a fifth of services are set to operate on heavily reduced hours, with those still running starting much 
later in the morning than usual and set to end as early as 6:30 pm (1730 GMT). 
The RMT rail union insists this week's actions are necessary as wages have failed to keep pace with UK inflation, 
which has hit a 40-year high and is on course to keep rising. 
It also wants a threat of compulsory redundancies withdrawn. 
RMT secretary general Mick Lynch said its members are "standing up for all working people trying to get a pay rise 
and some job security". 
"In a modern economy, workers need to be properly rewarded for their work, enjoy good conditions and have the 
peace of mind that their job will not be taken away from them," he added. 
Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said: "Unfortunately, the RMT's decision to carry out another day of 
needless and premature strike action means our passengers will suffer again on Saturday.

"A fraction of trains will run compared to a usual Saturday service, with trains starting later in the morning and 
finishing much earlier in the evening." 
Britain, like much of Europe, is suffering from rocketing inflation and stagnant economic growth, raising the prospect 
of a summer of strikes across the continent. 
Staff from budget Irish airline Ryanair staged strikes in Spain, Italy, France, Portugal and Belgium on Saturday, 
forcing the cancellation of two flights between Lisbon and Brussels. 
Ryanair staff staged their second day of action in Spain, resulting in delays to flights but so far no cancellations. 
One of the unions calling the strike said that, as of 10:00 am (0800 GMT), "there have been 15 delayed flights, both 
arrivals and departures. 
"It is expected that this situation will increase throughout the day and tomorrow, as Ryanair's maximum profit 
system of leaving the minimum time between flights will cause delays," it added. 
The aviation sector is struggling to recover from the pandemic, which led to mass layoffs as international travel was 
put on hold. 
Fresh Transport Strikes Hit UK, Mainland Europe
Faced with staff shortages, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was forced to announce earlier this month that it would 
be limiting traveller numbers this summer and cancelling flights. 
The shortages have already caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled, while huge queues have angered 
travellers.

Britain, like much of Europe, is suffering from rocketing inflation and stagnant economic growth, raising the prospect 
of a summer of strikes across the continent. 
Staff from budget Irish airline Ryanair staged strikes in Spain, Italy, France, Portugal and Belgium on Saturday. 
That forced the cancellation of two flights between Lisbon and Brussels, while in Spain, the USO transport union 
said 75 flights had been cancelled from six different locations. 
The union also denounced the fact that striking staff had been replaced by workers brought in from Morocco, a 
tactic which it described as illegal because it violated the right to strike. 
In Belgium, the walkout meant that only 41 percent of Ryanair flights left Charleroi airport near Brussels on 
Saturday. Since Friday, the budget carrier has been forced to cancel 127 flights, an airport spokeswoman told AFP. 
Fresh Transport Strikes Hit UK, Mainland Europe
The situation in Belgium was further complicated by a three-day strike by Brussels Airlines staff ending Saturday. 
That has forced the carrier, which is owned by German giant Lufthansa, to cancel 60 percent -- or some 300 -- of its 
flights since Thursday. 
Ryanair flights were also cancelled in France, Saturday. Damien Mourgues of the SNPNC union, said 36 out of 80 
flights had been cancelled because of a walk-out by air stewards. 
The airports at Bordeaux and Marseille said nine and 12 flights respectively would be cancelled on Sunday. 
The aviation sector is struggling to recover from the pandemic, which led to mass layoffs as international travel was 
put on hold. 
Faced with staff shortages, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was forced to announce earlier this month that it would

Summer Travel Misery Ahead As Industry Workers In Revolt

 A spiral of worker strikes in Europe's crucial aviation sector and cancelled flights at a time when millions of 
travellers are looking to escape for the summer, threaten the sector's tentative recovery. 
Airports and airlines are buckling under the pressure of demand pent up during the pandemic that has been 
unleashed on understaffed and stretched operations across Europe. 
A coordinated strike by Ryanair flight attendants in five European countries has thrown a spotlight on volatile labour 
relations at low cost airlines. 
"It's June and colleagues are already exhausted," said Damien Mourgues, SNPNC trade union representative at 
Ryanair. 
"Our basic salary is 854 euros ($900) with variables of 8.50 euros per hour" flown, he said. 
In Spain, "we have a basic salary of only 950 euros" and "when you don't fly, you earn 950 euros, that's all," 
complained Pier Luigi Copellon, a steward based in Barcelona for 14 years. 
At France's Transavia and Spain's Volotea the prospect of summer strikes is a growing possibility. 
At Brussels Airlines, which is on strike on Friday, "a crew member works between 50-60 hours over five days on 
average," said Claudia de Coster, a cabin purser and a representative of Belgium's Setca-FGTB union. 
Frontline airport security is suffering more than any other aviation workforce from understaffing as traffic picks up. 
Baggage and passenger screening officers at inspection points are being forced to manage massive footfall with 
fewer hands on deck than before. 
"We end up with two or three instead of five per security checkpoint," said Said Abdou, a Securitas employee at 
Paris Orly airport and a representative of the CGT union. 
"The pace is so fast. Securitas had hired 17 people recently, they did a day and they didn't come back -- it was too 
hard," he said.

/ Ramon van Flymen  
Eight of his colleagues suffered burn-out, he said, because they were refused leave this summer. 
Said Abdou earns 1,500 euros after taxes and deductions, paid 13 times a year, and an individual performance 
bonus of 500 euros per year after 18 years of service. 
On Monday, a strike by security staff at Brussels' Zaventem airport led to the cancellation of all the day's flights. 
"Among the baggage handlers, there are those who put the luggage on the carousel, those who are squatting in the 
aircraft hold to pack it up, it's very tiring," said Luc Atlan, an organiser in the airport branch of France's Unsa union. 
Summer Travel Misery Ahead As Industry Workers In Revolt
Baggage handling companies, which depend on major contracts from the likes of Air France, massively reduced 
staff at the height of the pandemic. 
The sudden rise in the rate of growth leads to "working under pressure. And with the lack of personnel you go fast 
and you get hurt. There's going to be an increasing rate of absences", said Atlan. 
They are less prominent than other front-line workers in the aviation ecosystem, but vital to the smooth running of 
the airport. 
The people charged with accompanying people with reduced mobility are no less essential to the travelling public. 
"We have a lot of delays, a lot of mistakes," said Ali Khiati, a member of the SUD union's aviation section. 
"There are people waiting for an hour on the plane," forcing the plane to remain grounded. 
"When you arrive after an hour, you are shouted at by the captain, by the customers, even though you only got the 
order five minutes previously," said Khiati. 
"I feel the summer will be catastrophic," he said, adding that he had never seen anything like it in his 18-year 
career. 
"A week ago, 21 people in the same day missed their plane. There were 16 who were leaving for Algiers, we put 
them in a (waiting area) -- but there was so much work that the dispatcher forgot about them," he said .

Market Chatter: Ryanair Reportedly Cancels Dozens of Flights in Europe as 
Cabin Staff Strike Begins

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) has canceled dozens of flights in Europe as some cabin crew at the budget airline went 
on strike in Belgium, Spain and Portugal on Friday, Reuters reported Friday. Workers in Europe are reacting to 
work and pay issues amid widespread high inflation and a surge in travel demand, the news agency said.
Ryanair cabin crew unions in those countries called a 3-day strike beginning Friday, while staff in Italy and France 
were expected to walk out over the weekend, Reuters reported.
Belgium is expected to be hardest hit by the strike, where 127 flights could be canceled at Charleroi airport, Reuters 
reported, citing local media. A total of 18 flights between Brussels and Spain were canceled Friday and Saturday, 
the news agency reported, citing Spain's cabin staff union. Also 2 flights from Lisbon to Brussels were canceled 
Friday, Reuters said.
Ryanair did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment Friday, but it told the outlet last week it had 
negotiated labor agreements covering 90% of its staff in Europe and did not expect widespread disruption this 
summer, the news agency reported.

to be from reliable sources but may include rumor and speculation. Accuracy is not guaranteed.)

 Strikes by staff at Ryanair and Brussels Airlines over pay and working conditions on Friday forced the cancelation 
of dozens of flights in Europe as the busy summer travel season gets underway. 
The strikes are adding more headaches to passengers and the aviation sector, which has struggled with staff 
shortages as it struggle to recruit people after massive layoffs during the Covid pandemic. 
Ryanair cabin crew unions in Spain, Portugal and Belgium called a three-day strike starting on Friday, and in Italy 
and France on Saturday. 
The biggest impact was felt in Belgium, where the work stoppage led Europe's biggest budget airline to cancel 127 
flights to and from Charleroi airport near Brussels between Friday and Sunday. 
Ryanair could only guarantee 30-40 percent of its scheduled flights at the airport, said a spokeswoman for Brussels 
South Charleroi Airport. 
The situation in Belgium was further complicated by a three-day strike by staff at Brussels Airlines, a unit of German 
airline Lufthansa, which began on Thursday. 
The company has cancelled 315 flights to and from Brussels' international airport during the three-day strike. 
The impact of the Ryanair strike was more limited in Portugal, where only two flights we cancelled on Friday 
morning, according to the SNPVAC union behind the walkout in the country. 
It expects the strike to gain force later in the day. 
In Spain, where Ryanair employs 1,900 people, no flights we cancelled except those heading to Belgium. 
"We didn't even know there was a strike...we didn't have any problem at all," said Manuel Carrion, a Spanish 
passenger with a Ryanair flight at Madrid airport. 
Spain's transport ministry on Thursday ordered Ryanair to operate 73 percent to 82 percent of flights over the strike 
period to maintain minimum services. 
It argued there needs to be a balance between the "right to strike" and the "interest of travellers".

But unions said Ryanair had gone beyond what was required and forced staff to maintain 100 percent of flights. 
Unions said they would take Ryanair to court as a result. 
"The company informed staff that all flights were subject to the minimum service, and threated them with 
disciplinary action," Ernesto Iglesias of local USO told reporters at Madrid airport. 
The airline was not "respecting the law," he added. 
Ryanair, Brussels Airlines Strikes Disrupt Europe Air Travel
Ryanair cabin crew unions in Spain have called another strike from June 30 to July 2. 
A strike on the weekend of June 12 and 13 already prompted the cancellation of about 40 Ryanair flights in France, 
or about a quarter of the total. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has been dismissive of the strikes, saying earlier this month that most of the 
company's flights "will continue to operate even if there is a strike in Spain by some Mickey Mouse union or if the 
Belgian cabin crew unions want to go on strike." 
Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet also faces nine days of strikes on different days in July at the Barcelona, Malaga 
and Palma de Mallorca airports. 
British Airways workers at London's Heathrow airport have voted to strike over pay as the cost-of-living crisis 
worsens in the UK, though no dates were set yet. 
The strikes come as air travel has rebounded since Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted. 
But the staff shortages have forced airlines to cancel flights, with German carrier Lufthansa cancelling more than 
3,000 of them during the summer holidays. 
On Monday, the European Transport Workers' Federation called "on passengers not to blame the workers for the 
disasters in the airports, the cancelled flights, the long queues and longer time for check-ins, and lost luggage or 
delays caused by decades of corporate greed and a removal of decent jobs in the sector." 
The Federation said it expects "the chaos the aviation sector is currently facing will only grow over the summer as 
workers are pushed to the brink."

 Some cabin crew at Ryanair went on strike in Belgium, Spain and Portugal on Friday in a dispute over pay and 
working conditions, causing limited disruption as the budget airline cancelled dozens of flights that left hundreds of 
passengers stranded. 
Surging inflation across Europe has led to millions of workers struggling with a higher cost of living, prompting trade 
unions to demand higher wage increases often backed by strike calls. 
Airlines and airport operators across Europe have also struggled with staff shortages to handle the flow of 
passengers as demand for travel bounces back with the end of most COVID-19 restrictions. Workers at several 
other airlines, including British Airways, are also planning strikes this summer. 
Ryanair cabin crew unions in Belgium, Spain and Portugal called a three-day strike starting on Friday. Staff in 
France and Italy were expected to walk out over the weekend. Crews in Spain are set to strike again on June 30 
and July 1-2. 
Workers say the Irish airline does not respect local labour laws covering issues such as the minimum wage and 
urge Ryanair's bosses to improve working conditions. 
"Conditions are terrible," said Ricardo Penarroias, president of SNPVAC, the union behind Portugal's walkout. "A 
crew member is not even allowed to take a bottle of water on a flight." 
Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday, but told Reuters last week it had 
negotiated labour agreements covering 90% of its staff across Europe and that it did not expect widespread 
disruption this summer. 
WAGE-PRICE SPIRAL 
While much of the labour unrest has focused on the transport sector as it deals with a return to travel after 
pandemic lockdowns, there are signs of that spreading to other sectors - French trade union CGT is organising a 
one-day strike on Friday to seek higher wages for oil refinery workers after talks with operator TotalEnergies broke 
down. 
With inflation running at more than 8% in the euro area, a 40-year-high of 9.1% in Britain, and in double digits 
across some central and eastern European economies, authorities are worried of a wage-price spiral developing in 
which higher wage demands add to inflationary pressures. 
European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde has warned that the longer inflation remains high, the more likely it 
will influence wage negotiations. 
Ryanair Cabin Staff Strike Cancels Dozens Of Flights In Europe
Pilot and cabin crew unions of Brussels Airlines, the Belgian subsidiary of Lufthansa, also started a strike on 
Thursday. Over the three days, Brussels Airlines expects to cancel about 60% of its 533 flights. 
Belgium is likely to be the hardest hit by the Ryanair strike, with local media saying 127 flights at Brussels' Charleroi 
airport would be cancelled, affecting 21,000 passengers. 
In Lisbon, two flights were cancelled on Friday so far, both to Brussels. A total of 18 Ryanair flights between 
Brussels and Spanish cities were cancelled on Friday and Saturday, Spain's cabin staff union, USO, said. 
In Spain, the government forced the company to operate 73%-82% of flights over the strike period to maintain 
minimum services, obliging most to go to work. 
The SNPVAC union said not many flights would be cancelled from the Portuguese airports because the airline 
placed strikers on stand-by and asked cabin crew in other countries to replace them. Ryanair has said SNPVAC 
only represented 3% of its staff in Portugal. 
Outside Lisbon airport, American Michael Rossides, 59, said he booked an EasyJet flight because he thought 
Ryanair would cancel but that ended up not happening. 
"We have wasted a fair amount of time, an extra couple of hours, and a few hundred dollars," he said.

As a wave of fintechs rode successive funding rounds to ever-higher valuations in the past five years, Swedish 'buy 
now, pay later' group Klarna declared its ambition to become the Ryanair, Tesla and Amazon of the sector.
But now as central banks raise rates in a fight against surging inflation, Klarna is trying to raise fresh cash at less 
than half its peak $46bn valuation and fintechs are having to come to terms with a world where expansion can no 
longer be fuelled by cheap money and business models must be proven by profits.
A record amount of investment poured into fintech groups in 2021, but many now struggle to raise fresh funds, and 
are discussing selling themselves or accepting lower valuations to stay afloat, according to investors, analysts and 
executives in the industry.
Yesterday, payments services provider SumUp raised cash at a valuation of (EURO)8bn - significantly below the 
(EURO)20bn valuation mooted earlier this year.
And as belts tighten, a fintech's chances of survival may be measured by the amount of cash sitting on its balance 
sheet. "You are in panic mode if your runway is less than a year," said Erik Podzuweit, founder and co-chief 
executive of German investment company Scalable Capital.
Fintechs face a reckoning as easy money ends and valuations collapse Fundraising in the most recent quarter

Venture capital firms more than doubled their investments in the sector last year to $134bn, helping fintech 
valuations outperform any other tech subsector, according to Crunchbase data. Funding peaked in the second 
quarter of 2021 as investors such as Accel, Sequoia
Capital, SoftBank and Berkshire Hathaway backed firms including Brazilian digital lender Nubank, German broker 
Trade Republic and Amsterdam-based payments group Mollie. Financial services companies accounted for roughly 
$1 out of every $5 in venture capital investment last year.
But now public fintech valuations have collapsed even faster than they climbed as funding slowed sharply in the first 
quarter, and have had a steeper decline than any other technology sector, according to a recent report by 
Andreessen Horowitz partners which cited data fromCapitalIQ. Valuations fell from 25 times forward revenue in 
October of 2021 to 4 times in May.
Fintech fundraising in the most recent quarter dropped 21 per cent to $28.8bn from the record high of $36.6bn 
reached in the second quarter of last year, according to CBinisghts.
"It was easy for funds that raised a ton of money to say, 'Oh, we're just going to double the valuation' ... it doesn't 
necessarily follow company performance," said Jonathan Keidan, managing partner of Torch Capital which has 
invested in fintechs such as Acorns and Compass. "The effects will be public by the fall."
Many fintech companies raised capital at lofty valuations based on ambitious growth targets, said Arjun Kapur 
managing partner at Forecast Labs. "With all the market changes, most of them are not going to hit the goals they 
signed up for which means the business is not worth what it raised."
Though he expects the sector will bounce back over the long term, "many businesses will get squeezed out in the 
process".
Investors have grown sceptical of consumer-facing digital challenger banks as high inflation lowers how much 
people can save and increases the likelihood of defaults. Funding to banking fintechs plunged 48 per cent to $4.4bn 
in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, according to CBInsights.
Robert Le, fintech analyst at Pitch- Book, said that a bifurcation in funding was likely, as consumer-facing fintechs 
struggle while those selling software to other businesses will prove more stable. Among those is UK cloud banking 
fintech Thought Machine, which doubled its valuation to $2.7bn in its latest funding round in May.
Meanwhile, executives such as Yorick Naeff, chief executive of Dutch broker Bux, are considering postponing 
planned fundraising rounds. "These companies, including us, should focus more on the path to profitability," he told 
the Financial Times. "If you are organised in a way that is just focused on growth ... you are going to run into 
trouble."
Many consumer fintech companies in the US have started to dial back their marketing budgets to conserve cash, 
said David Sosna, CEO of Personetics, which provides marketing insights for banks. "We definitely see some 
[clients] saying, 'OK, maybe we need to stop or slow down'." Bankers are advising companies to conserve as much 
cash as possible to ride out what will probably be a difficult two years for fundraising.
"When you factor in the time it takes to raise a round, you probably need 30 to 36 months runway so you're not 
forced back to the market," said a senior banker at a US commercial bank. Only extremely strong companies would 
be able to raise even at the same level as last year, the person added.
Freetrade, the UK broker valued at £650mn in November, raised £30mn through a loan last month. CEO Adam 
Dodds said that the move aimed to shore up its balance sheet without having to revalue it: "It's choppy markets. To 
zero in on a valuation at this point is maybe not that helpful."
In addition to a lower valuation, which can be an embarrassing signal to markets and hurt morale internally, down 
rounds may carry stricter terms, said S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Tom Mason.
Fintechs face a reckoning as easy money ends and valuations collapse Fundraising in the most recent quarter 
fell 21% to $28.8bn from a record $36.6bn reached la....
Selling out entirely is becoming an increasingly attractive option for many companies, said Keidan. Apple's privacy 
changes have significantly increased customer acquisition costs, making existing customer bases more valuable at 
the same time fintech valuations are coming down. Boards began exploring potential sales in the spring, he said.
Fintech acquisitions, already on track to pass 2021's record, are likely to accelerate through the rest of the year as 
traditional financial firms such as JPMorgan Chase and Mastercard take advantage of cheap software groups.
"I'm seeing it brewing very fast right now," said Michael Abbott, global banking lead at Accenture, adding that tie 
ups between fintech challengers and incumbents are on the rise.
Deals so far this year include UBS's acquisition of Wealthfront, and Fiserv's purchase of Finxact. "What consumers 
want is the best of what the neobanks have to offer in terms of experience and an ability to get products quickly, but 
at the same time what they're going to need in a rising rate environment is the balance sheet of a bank," said 
Abbott.
One investor at a large private equity firm said they had received a steady drumbeat of pitches from fintechs looking 
to sell themselves in recent weeks, but had so far passed on all of them.
"Who's to say this price is really the right price? What if six months from now that price is actually considered too 
expensive?"

"I'm seeing it brewing very fast right now," said Michael Abbott, global banking lead at Accenture, adding that tie 
ups between fintech challengers and incumbents are on the rise.
Deals so far this year include UBS's acquisition of Wealthfront, and Fiserv's purchase of Finxact. "What consumers 
want is the best of what the neobanks have to offer in terms of experience and an ability to get products quickly, but 
at the same time what they're going to need in a rising rate environment is the balance sheet of a bank," said 
Abbott.
One investor at a large private equity firm said they had received a steady drumbeat of pitches from fintechs looking 
to sell themselves in recent weeks, but had so far passed on all of them.
"Who's to say this price is really the right price? What if six months from now that price is actually considered too 
expensive?"

As a wave of fintechs rode successive funding rounds to ever-higher valuations in the past five years, Swedish 'buy 
now, pay later' group Klarna declared its ambition to become the Ryanair, Tesla and Amazon of the sector.
But now as central banks raise rates in a fight against surging inflation, Klarna is trying to raise fresh cash at less 
than half its peak $46bn valuation and fintechs are having to come to terms with a world where expansion can no 
longer be fuelled by cheap money and business models must be proven by profits.
A record amount of investment poured into fintech groups in 2021, but many now struggle to raise fresh funds, and 
are discussing selling themselves or accepting lower valuations to stay afloat, according to investors, analysts and 
executives in the industry.
Yesterday, payments services provider SumUp raised cash at a valuation of (EURO)8bn - significantly below the 
(EURO)20bn valuation mooted earlier this year.
And as belts tighten, a fintech's chances of survival may be measured by the amount of cash sitting on its balance 
sheet. "You are in panic mode if your runway is less than a year," said Erik Podzuweit, founder and co-chief 
executive of German investment company Scalable Capital.
Fintechs face a reckoning as easy money ends and valuations collapse Fundraising in the most recent quarter 
fell 21% to $28.8bn from a record $36.6bn reached la....
Venture capital firms more than doubled their investments in the sector last year to $134bn, helping fintech 
valuations outperform any other tech subsector, according to Crunchbase data. Funding peaked in the second 
quarter of 2021 as investors such as Accel, Sequoia
Capital, SoftBank and Berkshire Hathaway backed firms including Brazilian digital lender Nubank, German broker 
Trade Republic and Amsterdam-based payments group Mollie. Financial services companies accounted for roughly 
$1 out of every $5 in venture capital investment last year.
But now public fintech valuations have collapsed even faster than they climbed as funding slowed sharply in the first 
quarter, and have had a steeper decline than any other technology sector, according to a recent report by 
Andreessen Horowitz partners which cited data fromCapitalIQ. Valuations fell from 25 times forward revenue in 
October of 2021 to 4 times in May.
Fintech fundraising in the most recent quarter dropped 21 per cent to $28.8bn from the record high of $36.6bn 
reached in the second quarter of last year, according to CBinisghts.
"It was easy for funds that raised a ton of money to say, 'Oh, we're just going to double the valuation' ... it doesn't 
necessarily follow company performance," said Jonathan Keidan, managing partner of Torch Capital which has 
invested in fintechs such as Acorns and Compass. "The effects will be public by the fall."
Many fintech companies raised capital at lofty valuations based on ambitious growth targets, said Arjun Kapur 
managing partner at Forecast Labs. "With all the market changes, most of them are not going to hit the goals they 
signed up for which means the business is not worth what it raised."
Though he expects the sector will bounce back over the long term, "many businesses will get squeezed out in the 
process".
Investors have grown sceptical of consumer-facing digital challenger banks as high inflation lowers how much 
people can save and increases the likelihood of defaults. Funding to banking fintechs plunged 48 per cent to $4.4bn 
in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, according to CBInsights.
Robert Le, fintech analyst at Pitch- Book, said that a bifurcation in funding was likely, as consumer-facing fintechs 
struggle while those selling software to other businesses will prove more stable. Among those is UK cloud banking 
fintech Thought Machine, which doubled its valuation to $2.7bn in its latest funding round in May.
Meanwhile, executives such as Yorick Naeff, chief executive of Dutch broker Bux, are considering postponing 
planned fundraising rounds. "These companies, including us, should focus more on the path to profitability," he told 
the Financial Times. "If you are organised in a way that is just focused on growth ... you are going to run into 
trouble."
Many consumer fintech companies in the US have started to dial back their marketing budgets to conserve cash, 
said David Sosna, CEO of Personetics, which provides marketing insights for banks. "We definitely see some 
[clients] saying, 'OK, maybe we need to stop or slow down'." Bankers are advising companies to conserve as much 
cash as possible to ride out what will probably be a difficult two years for fundraising.
"When you factor in the time it takes to raise a round, you probably need 30 to 36 months runway so you're not 
forced back to the market," said a senior banker at a US commercial bank. Only extremely strong companies would 
be able to raise even at the same level as last year, the person added.
Freetrade, the UK broker valued at £650mn in November, raised £30mn through a loan last month. CEO Adam 
Dodds said that the move aimed to shore up its balance sheet without having to revalue it: "It's choppy markets. To 
zero in on a valuation at this point is maybe not that helpful."
In addition to a lower valuation, which can be an embarrassing signal to markets and hurt morale internally, down 
rounds may carry stricter terms, said S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Tom Mason.
Fintechs face a reckoning as easy money ends and valuations collapse Fundraising in the most recent quarter 
fell 21% to $28.8bn from a record $36.6bn reached la....
Selling out entirely is becoming an increasingly attractive option for many companies, said Keidan. Apple's privacy 
changes have significantly increased customer acquisition costs, making existing customer bases more valuable at 
the same time fintech valuations are coming down. Boards began exploring potential sales in the spring, he said.
Fintech acquisitions, already on track to pass 2021's record, are likely to accelerate through the rest of the year as 
traditional financial firms such as JPMorgan Chase and Mastercard take advantage of cheap software groups.
"I'm seeing it brewing very fast right now," said Michael Abbott, global banking lead at Accenture, adding that tie

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has had to cancel some flights as cabin crew have gone on strike in Belgium, 
Spain and Portugal today, the first of at least six days of planned action in different countries.
Walk-outs are expected in Italy and France as well, with staff around Europe in dispute with the Irish budget airline 
over pay and working conditions.
Cabin crew in Spain are planning to walk out on June 24, 25, 26 and 30, as well as July 1 and 2 due to 
unsatisfactory working conditions and pay.
Belgium's trade unions say Ryanair is not complying with labour laws, forcing them to take action, and as a result 
they plan to walk out from June 24 to 26.
The Brussels Zaventem Airport had already cancelled all flights on Monday due to security concerns.
Italian employees have called for a 24-hour strike on June 25, joining their colleagues in Spain and Portugal, while 
several airports in France are expected to be affected by union actions scheduled for June 25 and 26.
Summer travel in Europe is already suffering from cancellations, delays, and long queues at airports, with the 
disruption caused by lack of jobs after the sweeping job and pay cuts made during the pandemic.

Lufthansa is to cut over 3,000 flights this summer due to staff shortages on account of Covid-19 and strikes.
Germany's flagship airline is cancelling both domestic and European routes for July and August, adding to Europe's 
travel chaos right in the midst of the crucial summer vacation period.
The news comes as a second wave of announcements was confirmed on Thursday, and relates to 2,200 flights - or 
3% of those scheduled.
The airline already cut back 5% of summer flights on Fridays and weekends, including 900 connections and said 
several bottlenecks and shortage of personnel meant the entire European aviation industry is facing staff shortages.
Unrest between workers seeking wage increases to keep up with inflation is adding to the problem, with strikes also 
threatened or underway at rival airlines including Ryanair Holdings and British Airways.
Although travel demand has increased, a Lufthansa spokesperson noted infrastructure has not yet been fully 
restored.

 Strikes by staff at Ryanair and Brussels Airlines over pay and working conditions on Friday forced the cancelation 
of dozens of flights in Europe as the busy summer travel season gets underway. 
The strikes are adding more headaches to passengers and the aviation sector, which has struggled with staff 
shortages as it struggle to recruit people after massive layoffs during the Covid pandemic. 
Ryanaircabin crew unions in Spain, Portugal and Belgium called a three-day strike starting on Friday, and in Italy 
and France on Saturday. 
The biggest impact was felt in Belgium, where the work stoppage led Europe's biggest budget airline to cancel 127 
flights to and from Charleroi airport near Brussels between Friday and Sunday. 
Ryanair could only guarantee 30-40 percent of its scheduled flights at the airport, said a spokeswoman for Brussels 
South Charleroi Airport. 
The situation in Belgium was further complicated by a three-day strike by staff at Brussels Airlines, a unit of German 
airline Lufthansa, which began on Thursday. 
The company has cancelled 315 flights to and from Brussels' international airport during the three-day strike. 
The impact of the Ryanair strike was more limited in Portugal, where only two flights we cancelled on Friday 
morning, according to the SNPVAC union behind the walkout in the country. 
It expects the strike to gain force later in the day. 
In Spain, where Ryanair employs 1,900 people, no flights we cancelled except those heading to Belgium. 
'We didn't even know there was a strikewe didn't have any problem at all,' said Manuel Carrion, a Spanish 
passenger with a Ryanair flight at Madrid airport. 
Spain's transport ministry on Thursday ordered Ryanair to operate 73 percent to 82 percent of flights over the strike 
period to maintain minimum services. 
It argued there needs to be a balance between the 'right to strike' and the 'interest of travellers'. 
- Threats - 
But unions said Ryanair had gone beyond what was required and forced staff to maintain 100 percent of flights. 
Unions said they would take Ryanair to court as a result. 
'The company informed staff that all flights were subject to the minimum service, and threated them with disciplinary 
action,' Ernesto Iglesias of local USO told reporters at Madrid airport. 
Ryanair, Brussels Airlines strikes disrupt Europe air travel
The airline was not 'respecting the law,' he added. 
Ryanair cabin crew unions in Spain have called another strike from June 30 to July 2. 
A strike on the weekend of June 12 and 13 already prompted the cancellation of about 40 Ryanair flights in France, 
or about a quarter of the total. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has been dismissive of the strikes, saying earlier this month that most of the 
company's flights 'will continue to operate even if there is a strike in Spain by some Mickey Mouse union or if the 
Belgian cabin crew unions want to go on strike.' 
- 'Pushed to the brink' - 
Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet also faces nine days of strikes on different days in July at the Barcelona, Malaga 
and Palma de Mallorca airports. 
British Airways workers at London's Heathrow airport have voted to strike over pay as the cost-of-living crisis 
worsens in the UK, though no dates were set yet. 
The strikes come as air travel has rebounded since Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted. 
But the staff shortages have forced airlines to cancel flights, with German carrier Lufthansa cancelling more than 
3,000 of them during the summer holidays. 
On Monday, the European Transport Workers' Federation called'on passengers not to blame the workers for the 
disasters in the airports, the cancelled flights, the long queues and longer time for check-ins, and lost luggage or 
delays caused by decades of corporate greed and a removal of decent jobs in the sector.' 
The Federation said it expects 'the chaos the aviation sector is currently facing will only grow over the summer as 
workers are pushed to the brink.'

Following thechaotic scenes[2]witnessed at US airports over the last several weeks, travel chaos has spread to 
Europe as airlines canceled thousands of flights this summer. 
Bloomberg[3]reports Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the second-largest airline in Europe in terms of passenger volume, 
canceled 3,100 flights for July and August as COVID-19 infections exacerbated staffing shortages. 
Germany's top airline slashed 2,200 domestic flights on Friday, adding to the 900 announced weeks ago at 
Frankfurt and Munich hubs. 
'In order to inform the passengers as early as possible, Lufthansa will now take another 2,200 of a total of around 
80,000 flights at the hubs in Frankfurt and Munich out of the system for the summer - also on the others, so far less 
affected days of the week. The cancellations relate in particular to domestic German and intra-European flights, but 
not to the classic holiday destinations, which are well occupied during the holiday season. In addition, there may 
also be changes in flight times,' Lufthansa spokesman told German newspaperBILD[4]. 
Besides Lufthansa, labor strikes are emerging among Ryanair Holdings Plc, IAG SA's British Airways, and Brussels 
Airlines (Belgian subsidiary of Lufthansa) employees. 
Cabin crew at Ryanair went on strike across Belgium, Spain, and Portugal on Friday over lack of pay amid surging 
inflation. British Airways check-in staff are set to strike at Heathrow Airport in London. And Brussels Airlines workers 
began strikes on Thursday.

'Airports have had to adjust their schedules as a result of the chaos. London Gatwick last week announced it would 
scrap hundreds of flights over the peak summer travel period — hours after Amsterdam's Schiphol hub took a 
similar step — because of the deepening staffing crisis,' Bloomberg said.

Nearly 130 flights were scrubbed from the weekend schedule at Charleroi Airport in Brussels due to a strike by 
Ryanair workers, adding to the Belgian capital's air travel chaos.
The employees of the Ireland-based low-cost carrier are demanding that the company apply Belgium's minimum 
wage rules for cabin crew.
The CSC trade union also criticizes, among other things, that there is no food or drink on board for staff to consume 
and that wage cuts are being imposed under the threat of mass lay-offs.
The nearly 130 flights were cancelled on Friday and over the weekend at Charleroi, one of the two main airports the 
Belgian capital, according to the Belga news agency.
Meanwhile, pilots and cabin crew at Brussels Airlines have been on strike in Belgium since Thursday. The 
employees of the Lufthansa subsidiary say they are suffering under an increasingly heavy workload.
The airline announced before the start of the three-day strike that 40,000 passengers were expected to be affected. 
Belga reported that 315 flights would be cancelled by Saturday.

 Following thechaotic scenes[2]witnessed at US airports over the last several weeks, travel chaos has spread to 
Europe as airlines canceled thousands of flights this summer.  
 Bloomberg[3]reports Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the second-largest airline in Europe in terms of passenger volume, 
canceled 3,100 flights for July and August as COVID-19 infections exacerbated staffing shortages.  
 Germany's top airline slashed 2,200 domestic flights on Friday, adding to the 900 announced weeks ago at 
Frankfurt and Munich hubs.  
 "In order to inform the passengers as early as possible, Lufthansa will now take another 2,200 of a total of around 
80,000 flights at the hubs in Frankfurt and Munich out of the system for the summer - also on the others, so far less 
affected days of the week. The cancellations relate in particular to domestic German and intra-European flights, but 
not to the classic holiday destinations, which are well occupied during the holiday season. In addition, there may 
also be changes in flight times," Lufthansa spokesman told German newspaperBILD[4].  
 Besides Lufthansa, labor strikes are emerging among Ryanair Holdings Plc, IAG SA's British Airways, and 
Brussels Airlines (Belgian subsidiary of Lufthansa) employees.  
 Cabin crew at Ryanair went on strike across Belgium, Spain, and Portugal on Friday over lack of pay amid surging 
inflation. British Airways check-in staff are set to strike at Heathrow Airport in London. And Brussels Airlines workers 
began strikes on Thursday.

 "Airports have had to adjust their schedules as a result of the chaos. London Gatwick last week announced it 
would scrap hundreds of flights over the peak summer travel period — hours after Amsterdam's Schiphol hub took 
a similar step — because of the deepening staffing crisis," Bloomberg said.  
 Have you got European travel plans this summer? Be prepared for delays and canceled flights, similar to what's 
happening in the US because of apilot shortage[2].

FTSE 100 closes down 68 points  
•
US stocks turn mixed after early gains  
•
Rail strikes bite again; airlines could be next
4.50pm: Footsie flops
The FTSE 100 index ended lower on Thursday with the mood staying cautious amid weak PMI data, higher interest 
rates and recession worries, while another UK rail strike took its toll as more transport unions prepare for industrial 
action.
At the close, the UK blue-chip index was 68.77 points, or 1.0% lower at 7,020.45, just above the session low of 
7,014.19, and well below the morning peak of 7,115.80.
Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK commented: "After yesterday's falls European markets 
were already looking vulnerable over rising concerns about a global slowdown. These fears have been further 
exacerbated after the latest flash PMIs from Germany and France pointed to further economic weakness in June, 
raising the prospect that both economies could well be sliding into recession."
He added: "The FTSE 100 has also slipped back on similar concerns about the global economic outlook with the 
worst-performing sector being real estate, as well as basic resources."
FTSE 100 closes lower as recession worries added to by strike woes; US stocks turn mixed
"The slide in yields, along with concerns about a UK economic slowdown is hurting financials with Barclays, 
NatWest and Lloyds Banking Group all sliding back. Anyone thinking of looking to go abroad to escape the bleak 
economic landscape now has the prospect of further strikes to contend with after British Airways staff became the 
latest to vote to go out on strike, following in the footsteps of easyJet staff in Spain and Ryanair earlier this month," 
Hewson said.
US stocks managed to rally in their morning trading, however, as investors focused on Federal Reserve chair 
Jerome Powell's second day of Congressional testimony, although the gains were soon eroded and the market 
turned mixed.
In New York, around London's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 9 points, or 0.03% at 30,473, while 
the broader S&P 500 index gained 0.3% and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite added 1.0%.
CMC's Hewson noted: "US markets started the day on the front foot despite a pretty poor set of manufacturing and 
services PMI numbers for June, which showed sharp falls from the levels in May, tipping both back to levels last 
seen in 2020."
3.30pm: Choppy week in financial markets
Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA reflects on today's market movements.
"It's been a rather choppy week in financial markets and we're seeing that reflected again on Thursday, with 
European stocks back in negative territory after recovering losses earlier."
"Equity markets have fallen heavily over the last couple of weeks as aggressive tightening and heightened 
recession fears weigh heavily on risk appetite. They may now be establishing a temporary bottom as yields ease off 
their highs but don't get too excited."
"The outlook is highly uncertain, and economic risks are heavily tilted to the downside, making any significant stock 
market recovery challenging."
"Slowly but surely, central banks are coming around to the idea that recessions may be the price to pay for price 
stability. Some are better placed than others to weather the storm but even they may ultimately get swept up in it 
eventually."
3.00pm: BA to strike at Heathrow this summer
British Airways workers have voted to strike during the school summer holidays in a move set to cause more travel 
chaos.
The GMB trade union balloted its BA members working at Heathrow Airport on Thursday morning - announcing 
shortly after that 95% of workers had voted to strike this summer.
2.50pm: Offshore energy industry hits back
Rishi Sunak has been told by the UK's offshore oil industry that his new windfall tax will hit investment.
Sunak met oil and gas chiefs in Aberdeen today, a month after imposing a levy on the earnings of energy 
companies as the cost-of-living crisis continues to spiral.
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of Offshore Energies UK, said the new tax would undermine the industry.
"The Energy Profits Levy is an unexpected new tax that changes the basis for investments," Michie said.
"We had a candid and constructive meeting with the chancellor to discuss these issues and our industry leaders 
were clear about their concerns, especially the impact on investor confidence."
FTSE 100 closes lower as recession worries added to by strike woes; US stocks turn mixed
"Both sides have committed to further discussions."
2.15pm: US jobless claims falls, but still ahead of consenus
229,000 people in the US filed for unemployment claims last week, slightly above the consensus of 226,000, but 
still below the previous week of 231,000.

1.55pm: Heathrow strikes could be next
More strikes that affect travel plans could be on the way this summer, this time at Heathrow airport as 700 members 
of check-in and ground staff vote on whether to take action.
Unions GMB and Unite are running the ballot, with the result of the vote expected this afternoon, although the Unite 
ballot closes on Monday.
A spokesperson for GMB said if the strike action went ahead, it would be "likely during school holidays."
1.25pm: Nike makes permanent exit from Russia
After initially suspending operations a few months ago, Nike has officially ended all business in Russia, making a 
full exit as the Kremlins war with Ukraine rages on.

12.50pm: US preview
US markets were expected to open mixed on Thursday as US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell prepares 
for a second day of testimony before Congress, having already warned about the likelihood of recession on 
Wednesday.
Powell also said that it would be difficult to achieve a soft landing for the economy, signaling that inflation will stay 
elevated for the foreseeable future and denting the wider economy.
Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% in pre-market trading, while those for the broader S&P 500 
index rose 0.3%, and contracts for the Nasdaq-100 were up 0.3%.
"Market optimism couldn't survive Jerome Powell's testimony yesterday, as he said that a recession is possible and 
that a soft landing is 'very challenging' under the current circumstances," said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at 
Swissquote Bank.
"More worryingly, Powell mentioned another risk: the risk of the Federal Reserve not managing to restore price 
stability and allowing inflation to get entrenched in the economy," she added.
The gloomy outlook for the world's biggest economy took a toll on share prices as investors shied away from taking 
on new positions.
With Powell testifying again today, investors will be hoping that most of the negative pricing is out of the way by now 
but there are growing fears that the Fed is losing the battle against inflation and that its aggressive rate hikes will 
instead crimp economic growth and dent corporate bottom lines. 
As Powell appears before Congress, his words will be up for scrutiny, suggesting that stock markets are in for 
another choppy session.

In energy markets, WTI crude oil futures lost 0.7% to $105.42 a barrel and Brent crude futures shed 0.6 % 
to $111.07, amid concerns that global economic growth may falter.
12.15pm: Another record for fuel prices
Fuel prices hit another record yesterday, despite a drop in a wholesale petrol prices last week, according to the 
latest figures.
The average price rose to 189.84p per litre, while diesel 198p, data from RAC Fuel Watch showed.
Simon Williams, a spokesperson for the RAC said, "It seems as though we are just days away from the frightening 
prospect of the price of diesel averaging £2 a litre across the UK taking the cost of a full tank to a staggering £110. 
For drivers who still think in gallons this would be £9 a gallon."
"We're surprised and disappointed to see the price of unleaded continuing to rise as the cost on the wholesale 
market tells a very different story."
"Over the course of last week delivered wholesale petrol averaged 148p a litre which should lead to a price of 
around 186p after factoring in 7p-a-litre retailer margin and VAT at 20%."
11.49am: Government gets an extra £100mln in inheritance tax
An extra £100mln of cash was taken from the clutches of dead Britons from April to May, according to today's latest 
data from HMRC, with the government's inheritance tax receipts reaching £1.1bn up from £1bn a year ago.
At the same time, total HMRC receipts amounted to £121.9bn, up £14.8bn versus the same period last year.
Of that, receipts from income tax, capital gains and national insurance were £9.7bn higher compared to last year, 
totalling £69.1bn.
It comes as the Treasury's borrowing costs are soaring because of index-linked bonds, a glut of which were issued 
during quantitative easing, which are now paying out to investors hand over fist as the rate of inflation has risen to a 
40-year high.
11.15am: Deal between RMT and Network Rail may be close
A deal between Network Rail and the RMT Union may be edging closer as the second of two planned rail strikes 
take place today.
Negotiations over jobs, pay and conditions had broken down yesterday between the trade union and rail employers, 
but the conciliatory language from Network Rail this morning suggests a deal may be close.
Tim Shoveller, a member of Network Rail's negotiation team told the BBC this morning "We think we've got a 
package of no compulsory redundancies and some other long sought after things that the union and our employees 
have been after."
"We want to move forward with that package but we can only do that once we are that the productivity to pay for it 
is in place."
Shoveller also confirmed that the company is preparing to up its 3% pay rise, but not to the 7.1% agreed yesterday 
by Merseyrail.
10.45am: Consumer spending down
Consumer spending and the number of adverts decreased last week, new data from the Office for National 
Statistics showed.
FTSE 100 closes lower as recession worries added to by strike woes; US stocks turn mixed
Spending on debit and credit cards fell in all categories except 'work-related' expenses.
The latest figures suggest that growth is slowing.
 UK spending on debit and credit cards decreased to 100% of its February 2020 average in the week to 16 June

spending (which includes spending on road fuel) increased. pic.twitter.com/vagyxrmpWa - Office for National 
Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) June 23, 2022
10.15am: Flash PMI data
UK flash PMI data showed that business expectations slumped to the weakest level since May 2020, with new 
order growth losing considerable momentum in June.
Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 53.1 and Flash UK Services PMI Business Activity Index at 53.4 remain 
unchanged from the previous month.
However, UK Manufacturing Output Index hit a 16-month low at 51.2, while UK Manufacturing PMI hit a 23-month 
low of 53.4.
Service providers continued to outperform manufacturers, boosted by a sustained recovery in events and face-to-
face consumer spending.
Despite this, many survey respondents continued to cite growth headwinds associated with the cost-of-living crisis 
and economic uncertainty.
Notable, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said "business confidence 
has now slumped to a level which in the past has typically signalled an imminent recession."
9.45am: Quick snapshot
FTSE 100 hit the skids as worries over inflation, debt and the rail strike soured the mood. London's blue-chip index 
was down 58 at 7,031 in early trades.
Rishi Sunak is having to pay record amounts of interest on the country's £2trn debt due to the amount that is linked 
to inflation. Debt interest payments hit £7.6bn last month, the highest for any May on record, the Office for National 
Statistics said.
Heathrow has upped its forecast for passengers this year despite the chaos currently afflicting UK's number one 
airport. Some 54.4m passengers are now expected in 2022 or 67% of pre-Covid levels.
Some good news for property groups in London as club owner Ministry of Sound will turn a House of Fraser store in 
west London into flexible offices, a gym and rooftop bar-restaurant. The nightclub group is expected to open its 
second site at Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush in 2024.
Naked Wines shares tanked it warned of tough times ahead. The wine supplier posted a profit in its last financial 
year after a 9% increase in its subscription base but added at best it would break even this year.
Alpha Financial Markets by contrast hailed a "nothing short of outstanding" previous fiscal year. The financial sector 
consultant saw revenues surge 61% and confirmed strong trading has continued.
Next Fifteen also said recent trading has continued to be strong, aided by the strength of the US dollar. For the 
three months to April end, sales soared 68%, while profit before tax remained ahead of management expectations 
said the marketing group.
9.16am: 888 Holdings slumps
FTSE 100 closes lower as recession worries added to by strike woes; US stocks turn mixed
888 Holdings PLC (LSE:888), which is a constituent of the FTSE 250, slumped nearly 5% to 167.8p following its 
announcement released today over the proposed offering of £1bn of senior secured indebtedness.
Proceeds of the offering will be used to finance or refinance the purchase price of the proposed acquisition by 888 
of the international business of William Hill.
As well as that, it will also be used towards the repayment of existing indebtedness of the William Hill business and 
the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the transaction.
Galliford Try also had some news, telling investors its Highway Business has been appointed to the new Midlands 
Highway Alliance Plus Medium Schemes Framework.
The framework is valued at £1bn and will run for the next four years, covering 35 local authorities from Oxfordshire 
in the south to Cumbria in the north.
"Throughout the country we have a strong track record of delivering fruitful, collaborative partnerships with local 
authorities, and we look forward to working with the MHA+ and its client authorities to making a lasting impact on 
infrastructure around the country," said chief executive Bill Hocking.
8.49am: FTSE opens lower
London's blue-chip index opened lower, matching pre-market expectations, as the index lost 57 points to 7,032 in 
early trading.
Miners lead the way as some of the index's largest fallers, with Antofagasta, Glencore and Fresnillo all down more 
than 1.5%, with copper prices currently down.
Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, believes the latest comments from the US Federal Reserve 
did little to reassure investors.
"Markets remain on the back foot as the latest comments from the Federal Reserve did little to assuage investor 
concerns.
"Indeed, there seems no end in sight in the immediate future for this situation to change. Comments from Fed 
Reserve Chair Powell made their position clear."
"Interest rates will continue to rise, and at an accelerated pace, until there is "compelling evidence" that inflation is 
beginning to wane."
"This in turn decreases the likelihood of a soft landing for the economy, which the Fed fully recognises."
"Of course, the central bank is not attempting to induce a recession, but the outcome of its current stance is 
increasingly likely to provide one."
6.43am: Pre-market 
FTSE 100 was set for a low-key opening on what might turn out to be a quiet day all around with many workers 
likely to be at home on the second day of rail strikes.
Financial spread betting firms had Footsie opening around 25 points down an hour before the open though Asian 
markets were improving towards their close, which might spin over into London and change the picture ahead of the 
opening.
US markets followed London (read more) and closed slightly lower overnight after testimony from Federal Reserve 
chair Jerome Powell.
FTSE 100 closes lower as recession worries added to by strike woes; US stocks turn mixed
Warning that a recession was a real possibility, Powell also indicated that fighting inflation was also critical and that 
rising prices had to be halted.
"That left markets in somewhat of a no man's land," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda.
"US equities were clearly dying for any excuse to hit the buy button.
"But while Mr Powell was talking recession possibilities and being "nimble" from FOMC meeting to FOMC meeting, 
the reality that a recession probably isn't great for stocks tempered animal spirits."
Powell speaks again this evening, which might make things a little clearer.
In the UK, the rail strike, inflation and squeezed household incomes are again likely to be dominating the headlines, 
especially with little scheduled company news.
Indeed, AIM is likely to provide most of the reporting action with three of its larger constituents - Naked Wines, 
Alpha Financial Markets and Manolete Partners - all updating.
Ex-dividends at Experian (LSE:EXPN), British Land and United Utilities among others are expected to knock around 
4.7 points from FTSE 100.

German airline Lufthansa is cancelling more than 2,000 additional flights at its Frankfurt and Munich hubs due to 
staff shortages.
The company announced two weeks ago that it would cancel 900 connections in July. Now it will "take out of the 
system a further 2,200 of a total of 80,000 flights," Lufthansa said on Thursday.
"The cancellations will affect domestic German and intra-European flights in particular, but not the classic holiday 
destinations that are well utilized during this season," the company said, adding that flight schedules could also 
change.
"Aviation security strikes, weather events and in particular an increased rate of staff sick with Covid-19 have put 
additional strain on the system," Lufthansa said, explaining the decision.
Lufthansa passengers would be informed immediately of cancellations and, if possible, rebooked on other suitable 
flights. Alternatively, feeder flights within Germany could be replaced by train travel to the hubs, from where the 
planes would then take off for foreign destinations.
Lufthansa said it hoped the reduction to its schedule would "ensure greater overall stability."
In Brussels, meanwhile, strikes this week at Lufthansa Group's Brussels Airline, along with low-cost Irish carrier 
Ryanair, were affecting tens of thousands of passengers at the city's main Brussels Airport and the Brussels South 
Charleroi Airport.
Brussels Airlines alone cancelled more than 300 flights. Some 40,000 passengers are expected to be affected due 
to the walk-outs by cabin crew and pilots from Thursday to Saturday.

They say they are suffering from heavy workloads and worsening work conditions.
Employees of Ryanair are planning an industrial action from Friday to Sunday. According to the Belga news 
agency, 80 Ryanair connections at Charleroi airport are to be cancelled.
Ryanair workers are demanding compliance with Belgian minimum wage rules for cabin crew.

more of the last-minute cancellations that are currently plaguing the sector.
Airlines will be given a short window, described as an 'amnesty', to hand back any take-off and landing slots they 
feel they will not be able to operate during the busy summer period.
Previously, the government had demanded airlines put on a full flight schedule, adding they must fly 70% of their 
flight slots at airports or lose them.
"This will help passengers find alternative arrangements ahead of time, rather than face the kind of last-minute 
cancellations seen over the Easter and half-term holidays," a spokesperson said, quoted in Sky News.
Airports slots are bought by airlines to operate their schedules but can lose them to competitors if they do not use 
them and fail to maintain their obligations to airports and passengers.
Airlines giving up slots some time in advance, as opposed to last-minute cancellations, may open the opportunities 
for rivals to take up the spaces left behind.
For example, easyJet and British Airways have been some of the biggest offenders in recent weeks, with easyJet 
announcing releasing it will be forced to cancel thousands of flights this summer.
The amnesty announcement potentially, therefore, gives Ryanair an opportunity to take those allocations, possibly 
for the long term.
Airlines offered chance to give up slots to avoid cancellations
However, according to John Strickland, director at air transport consultancy JLS Consulting, the measures 
introduced are very much a temporary stance.
"Slots are immensely valuable to the airlines that use them."
"Currently it is more a case of relief that the pressure to use under very challenging circumstances rather than for 
any airline to seek opportunistic use if the capacity which is freed up."

Ryanair loses EU court case on state aid given to rival Finnair

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair lost a legal challenge against the EU's approval of millions in pandemic-related state 
aid to rival Finnair, according to a ruling published on Wednesday.
The aid given by the Finnish government was compatible with EU law, judges at the Luxembourg-based General 
Court said.
Finland had notified authorities it was providing financial aid to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros to the ailing 
airline Finnair in 2020. The aid was then approved by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.
Ryanair challenged the commission's decision, citing a lack of a formal review process and the violation of 
principles regarding equal treatment.
The court dismissed the action on the grounds of faulty reasoning on the part of Ryanair.
In the judges' view, it was sufficient that Finnair had serious difficulties in maintaining flight operations and that a 
default would have had a considerable impact on the Finnish economy.
Ryanair has taken action against the European Commission on several occasions regarding state aid offered to 
competitors to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Recently, the EU court had rejected a complaint against millions in aid that went to the German airline Condor. In 
other cases, however, Ryanair's lawsuits have met with success.

(Alliance News) - The EU Court of Justice on Wednesday dismissed a Ryanair Holdings PLC case seeking to annul 
Covid-19 aid granted to Finnish state-owned airline Finnair.
The complaint was part of a string of more than 20 court cases brought by the Dublin-based airline during the 
pandemic.
Ryanair has sought to undo the massive bailouts of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Air France KLM SA and other 
major EU airlines, with varying success.
Finnair was granted over EUR1 billion in aid as part of Finland's measures to support the economy during Covid-19.
"The action seeking annulment of the decision by the [European] Commission to approve aid granted by Finland to 
the airline Finnair is dismissed in its entirety," the EU court said.
Finnair told AFP that the "matter has undergone thorough scrutiny in the EU, and the court ruling is in line with our 
expectations". 
Criticising the bailouts as "discriminatory", Ryanair – Europe's biggest airline in terms of passenger numbers --
 claimed that the aid gives a "leg up" for airlines based on their nationality.
"The Covid-19 crisis has caused damage to all airlines," Ryanair said in a statement.
The Court of Justice of the EU has ruled in Ryanair's favour against Dutch airline KLM and Portugal's TAP, but 
dismissed cases against Austrian Airlines and Stockholm-based SAS.

 The General Court of the European Union rejected Ryanair's (RYA.IR) appeal against the state aid its competitor 
Finnair (FIA1S.HE) received from Finland, Reuters reported Wednesday.
The judges dismissed the claim saying that the commission was entitled to approve the aid "without initiating the 
formal investigation procedure."
The Irish low-cost carrier had argued that EU regulators should have launched a probe before approving the aid. 
Ryanair can appeal the decision in the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Ryanair shares were down almost 2% in Ireland and Finnair stock was down marginally on Wednesday afternoon.

Jun 22, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the latest development pertaining to the takeover of the Miramar, FL-based Spirit Airlines SAVE[1], JetBlue 
Airways JBLU[2] raised its offer to purchase SAVE. The move, made just ahead of Spirit's shareholder vote on Jun 
30, is aimed at winning this buyout race from rival bidder Frontier Group Holdings ULCC[3]. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] labor problems deepened with its cabin crew planning to go on strike 
shortly in certain European countries. On the other hand, U.S. based low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines LUV[5] 
raised its view for June quarter's load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) driven by upbeat air-travel demand. 
Again, owing to increased passenger traffic, Allegiant Travel's ALGT[6] load factor of 86.6% recorded in May was 
the highest in a month since the onset of the pandemic. Load factor for June is estimated to be roughly 90% Recap 
of the Latest Top Stories 1.Per the latest offer, JetBlue is offering $33.50 per share to Spirit Airlines' shareholders, 
up from the previous proposal of $31.50. This represents a premium of 68% to Frontier Group Holdings' proposal to 
acquire Spirit Airlines. JetBlue's enhanced proposal continues to offer a reverse break-up fee of $350 million (or 
$3.20 per Spirit Airlines share) payable to Spirit Airlines in case the deal fails to materialize due to antitrust 
concerns. The company had initially offered a reverse break-up fee of $200 million. Frontier's proposal consists of a 
reverse termination fee of $250 million. 
JBLU would prepay $1.50 per share in cash to Spirit Airlines' shareholders as soon as they vote in favor of the 
merger deal. With this, SAVE's shareholders will receive $33.50 per share in cash, consisting of $32 per share in 
cash at the time of closing of the transaction and the prepayment of $1.50 per share of the reverse break-up fee. 
Spirit Airlines confirmed the receipt of JetBlue's updated proposal and said that the board would evaluate it. In 
February, Frontier first offered to acquire Spirit Airlines in a $2.9-billion deal. Per the terms of the merger 
agreement, Spirit Airlines' shareholders will receive $25.83 per share. SAVE will own approximately 48.5% of the 
combined airline, while the remaining will be owned by ULCC[7]. 
2. Per a Reuters report[8], unions representing Ryanair's cabin crew are planning to go on strike in Belgium and 
Portugal from Jun 24 to Jun 26, in their quest for improved pay and working conditions. In France, they plan a strike 
from Jun 25 to Jun 26 and in Italy on Jun 25. Unions are also planning to go on strike in Spain on Jun 24, Jun 25, 
Jun 26, Jun 30, and Jul 1-Jul 2. The strikes, on materialization, may act as a spoiler as far as its plans of generating 
Airline Stock Roundup: JBLU Ups Bid for SAVE , RYAAY 's Labor Woes & More
high load factor readings in the summer months are concerned. That load factor is expected to be high in summer 
was discussed in the previous week's write-up[9]. 
3. Riding on the healthy booking trend, Southwest Airlines, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), upped 
its forecast for second-quarter 2022 load factor. The Dallas-based low-cost carrier now expects load factor in the 
85-87% range compared with the earlier estimate of 85%. Capacity forecast is being kept same (down 7% from 
second-quarter 2019 actuals). That means that the upped load factor forecast implies a higher level of traffic. Even 
though total operating revenues are likely to improve 12-15% from second-quarter 2019 actuals, the uptick is owing 
to the improvement in leisure travel. LUV expects second-quarter 2022 managed business revenues to be down in 
the 20-25% range, compared with second-quarter 2019 levels. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[10]. 
4. In May, Allegiant carried 40% more passengers, system-wide, than a year ago. Available seat miles (a measure 
of capacity) increased 17.1% year over year for the total system as ALGT expands capacity to meet increased 
demand. In sync with ALGT's capacity-expansion efforts, capacity for scheduled operations increased 15.5% in 
May 2022 from the May 2019 actuals (pre-coronavirus era). Due to the increase in oil price, ALGT now expects the 
average fuel price per gallon for the June quarter to be $4.30 (earlier estimate was $4). Due to increased flight 
cancellations as a result of labor crunch and a spike in COVID-19 cases, ALGT expects[11] second-quarter 2022 
operating revenues to increase roughly 28% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals, which matches the lowest end 
of the previous estimate of an increase in the 28-32% range. Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
declined 1.7% to $56.26, despite the 6% uptick in SAVE shares following the upgraded takeover offer from JBLU. 
Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index plummeted 31.9%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? Air-travel in the United States is being currently hampered due to the labor-crunch induced flight 
cancellations. With the labor unrest continuing, further updates on the issue are expected in the coming days.

EasyJet clinches TAP 's freed slots at Lisbon, Portugal
EasyJet clinches TAP's freed slots at Lisbon, Portugal

easyJet (U2, London Luton) has been awarded 18 daily slots at Lisbon airport vacated by TAP Air Portugal (TP, 
Lisbon) in line with its Brussels-approved receipt of EUR2.55 billion euros (USD2.68 billion) in Portuguese state 
restructuring aid.
The UK-headquartered budget carrier will be able to start operating new routes from Lisbon from the IATA winter 
season, starting October 30, 2022, according to a statement issued by the European Commission.
It said easyJet was ranked first amongst competing carriers based on the seat capacity it could provide.
In securing the slots, easyJet fended off competition from Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), which had been vociferously 
critical of the state support of TAP. Ryanair even took the matter to the European General Court, but the European 
regulator overruled the carrier's concerns. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary reportedly told the ECO media outlet 
that TAP had put pressure on the Commission to allocate the slots to its competitor, easyJet. The airline was not 
immediately available for comment.
The Irish low-cost carrier in March 2022 had cut 19 routes from Lisbon this summer following delays in the release 
of unused airport slots.
TAP has been compelled to give up the 18 daily slots at congested Lisbon to a competing carrier to level the 
playing field following the restructuring aid it received from Portugal in December 2021.
"Following an open procedure, easyJet will obtain 18 of the daily take-off and landing slots currently held by TAP at 
Lisbon airport. This will encourage competition in the European aviation sector, as it will enable easyJet to expand 
its activities at this congested airport, contributing to fair prices and increased choice for European consumers. This 
also helps ensure that the financial support given to TAP by Portugal to allow the carrier to return to viability has no 
undue negative effect on the Single Market," commented EC Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, who is 
in charge of competition policy.
A monitoring trustee was appointed by the TAP Group to monitor this commitment. On February 25, 2022, the 
monitoring trustee published a call for proposals, to which several interested carriers had replied.
EasyJet clinches TAP 's freed slots at Lisbon, Portugal
"The Commission, assisted by the monitoring trustee, has assessed in detail the proposals received against the 
eligibility, evaluation, and ranking criteria set out in the Commission decision of December 21, 2021. The 
Commission has ranked the proposals based on the seat capacity carriers would offer using the slots made 
available by TAP Air Portugal.
"Based on this assessment, the Commission has ranked easyJet's proposal first. easyJet has now priority to 
conclude with TAP Air Portugal the agreement for the slot transfer that will allow easyJet to expand its operations at 
Lisbon airport and offer new flights as of October 30, 2022," Brussels said.
a has welcomed the EC's decision. "The decision means that easyJet will be able to offer a wider choice in 
destinations and affordable fares for people travelling to and from the Portuguese capital. It also confirms the 
airline's key role in the Portuguese market and will create additional local employment opportunities. The additional 
capacity enabled by the new slots will be deployed starting in October," the airline said in a statement.
The airline currently serves five airports in Portugal, including Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Funchal, and Porto Santo. Since 
1998, easyJet has carried around 70 million passengers to and from Portugal, opened three bases and based 16 
aircraft in the country. "So far, compared to pre-pandemic levels easyJet has grown by 18% in Portugal including by 
14% in Lisbon, 50% in Porto, and 63% in Funchal. The airline opened its latest base in Faro in 2021," the statement 
read.

easyJet (U2, London Luton) has been awarded 18 daily slots at Lisbon airport vacated by TAP Air Portugal (TP, 
Lisbon) in line with its Brussels-approved receipt of EUR2.55 billion euros (USD2.68 billion) in Portuguese state 
restructuring aid.
The UK-headquartered budget carrier will be able to start operating new routes from Lisbon from the IATA winter 
season, starting October 30, 2022, according to a statement issued by the European Commission.
It said easyJet was ranked first amongst competing carriers based on the seat capacity it could provide.
In securing the slots, easyJet fended off competition from Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), which had been vociferously 
critical of the state support of TAP. Ryanair even took the matter to the European General Court, but the European 
regulator overruled the carrier's concerns. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary reportedly told the ECO media outlet 
that TAP had put pressure on the Commission to allocate the slots to its competitor, easyJet. The airline was not 
immediately available for comment.
The Irish low-cost carrier in March 2022 had cut 19 routes from Lisbon this summer following delays in the release 
of unused airport slots.
TAP has been compelled to give up the 18 daily slots at congested Lisbon to a competing carrier to level the 
playing field following the restructuring aid it received from Portugal in December 2021.
"Following an open procedure, easyJet will obtain 18 of the daily take-off and landing slots currently held by TAP at 
Lisbon airport. This will encourage competition in the European aviation sector, as it will enable easyJet to expand 
its activities at this congested airport, contributing to fair prices and increased choice for European consumers. This 
also helps ensure that the financial support given to TAP by Portugal to allow the carrier to return to viability has no 
undue negative effect on the Single Market," commented EC Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, who is 
in charge of competition policy.
A monitoring trustee was appointed by the TAP Group to monitor this commitment. On February 25, 2022, the 
monitoring trustee published a call for proposals, to which several interested carriers had replied.
EasyJet clinches TAP 's freed slots at Lisbon, Portugal
"The Commission, assisted by the monitoring trustee, has assessed in detail the proposals received against the 
eligibility, evaluation, and ranking criteria set out in the Commission decision of December 21, 2021. The 
Commission has ranked the proposals based on the seat capacity carriers would offer using the slots made 
available by TAP Air Portugal.
"Based on this assessment, the Commission has ranked easyJet's proposal first. easyJet has now priority to 
conclude with TAP Air Portugal the agreement for the slot transfer that will allow easyJet to expand its operations at 
Lisbon airport and offer new flights as of October 30, 2022," Brussels said.
a has welcomed the EC's decision. "The decision means that easyJet will be able to offer a wider choice in 
destinations and affordable fares for people travelling to and from the Portuguese capital. It also confirms the 
airline's key role in the Portuguese market and will create additional local employment opportunities. The additional 
capacity enabled by the new slots will be deployed starting in October," the airline said in a statement.
The airline currently serves five airports in Portugal, including Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Funchal, and Porto Santo. Since 
1998, easyJet has carried around 70 million passengers to and from Portugal, opened three bases and based 16 
aircraft in the country. "So far, compared to pre-pandemic levels easyJet has grown by 18% in Portugal including by 
14% in Lisbon, 50% in Porto, and 63% in Funchal. The airline opened its latest base in Faro in 2021," the statement 
read.

 Europe's low-cost airlines face a summer of discontent as staff in Spain and France announced new strikes over 
labour conditions on Tuesday. 
Trade unions representing Ryanair cabin crew in Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain have called for strikes 
this coming weekend, while easyJet's operations in Spain face a nine-day strike next month. 
Damien Mourgues, a representative of the SNPNC trade union at Ryanair in France, said the airline doesn't respect 
rest time laws and is calling for a raise for cabin crew still paid at the minimum wage. 
Cabin crew will go on strike on Saturday and Sunday. 
A strike on the weekend of June 12-13 already prompted the cancellation of about 40 Ryanair flights in France, or 
about a quarter of the total. 
Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet also faces nine days of strikes on different days in July at the Barcelona, Malaga 
and Palma de Mallorca airports.

passengers return en masse Photo: AFP / Adrian DENNIS  
The union said Tuesday that Spanish easyJet cabin crew, with a base pay of 950 euros per month, have the lowest 
wages of the airline's European bases. 
The strikes come as air travel has rebounded since Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted. 
But many airlines, which laid off staff during the pandemic, are having trouble rehiring enough workers and have 
been forced to cancel flights, including easyJet, which has been particularly hard hit by employee shortages. 
On Monday, the European Transport Workers' Federation called "on passengers not to blame the workers for the 
disasters in the airports, the cancelled flights, the long queues and longer time for check-ins, and lost luggage or 
delays caused by decades of corporate greed and a removal of decent jobs in the sector." 
The Federation said it expects "the chaos the aviation sector is currently facing will only grow over the summer as 
workers are pushed to the brink."

In Spain, trade unions have urged Ryanair cabin crews to strike from June 24 to July 2 to secure their "fundamental 
labour rights" and "decent work conditions for all staff". 
More Strike Calls Cloud Summer For European Low-cost Airlines
Ryanair staff in Portugal plan to go on strike from Friday to Sunday to protest work conditions, as are employees in 
Belgium. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has been dismissive of the strikes. 
"We operate two and half thousand flights every day," he said earlier this month in Belgium. 
"Most of those flights will continue to operate even if there is a strike in Spain by some Mickey Mouse union or if the 
Belgian cabin crew unions want to go on strike over here," he added in a media conference. 
But Ryanair pilots in Belgium decided over the weekend to join cabin crew in a strike from Friday. 
Meanwhile, staff at Brussels Airlines, a Lufthansa unit, have called a three-day strike from Thursday. 
In Italy, a 24-hour strike is set to hit Ryanair operations on Saturday with pilots and cabin crew calling for the airline 
to respect the minimum wages set for the sector under a national agreement. 
Airports have also been plagued by staff shortages, which have caused long lines at check-in counters and security 
checks, provoking the ire of travellers. 
On Monday, a strike by security agents caused the cancellation of all departures from Brussels' Zaventem airport. 
Cleaning staff at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport temporarily stopped working on Monday after missing out on a 
bonus. 
At Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, one of Europe's largest, staff are set to strike from July 1.

We have no (good) alternatives to EASYJET shambles

L ike thousands of others, I am due to fly with easyJet out of Gatwick next month. For probably the first time in my 
life, I wish I was flying Ryanair from almost anywhere else.
EasyJet has taken over from British Airways as the poster airline for last minute cancellations and delays, while 
Gatwick has replaced Manchester as the equivalent for airports. Yesterday easyJet said it would "proactively 
consolidate" flights to "build additional resilience", after both London Gatwick and Amsterdam's Schiphol said they 
would limit the number of passengers permitted to fly in July and August.
EasyJet depicts the problems as an industry issue - even an economy-wide one of supply chain disruptions caused 
by labour shortages - rather than admit it has handled things especially badly.
Clearly it is far from the only one affected, and airports and ground-handling groups deserve their share of the 
blame. Yet last week it cancelled 146 UK departures, according to data from airline analytics provider Cirium, more 
than any other airline.
That will be partly because it's the UK's biggest, running flights from some of its busiest airports, but then Ryanair 
did not make the top 10. And if it was so impossible to predict that cuts to schedules might be needed to smooth 
things out, why did British Airways cancel flights through to September from as early as April to increase reliability?
EasyJet's response is that it has run a service up to 2019's standards for all except two weeks: the first week in 
April and May's half-term. Still, it is surely not good enough to run a service that is up to scratch except when 
We have no (good) alternatives to EASYJET shambles
people most want to use it. And it should be foreseeable that another extended crunch might be coming with the 
onset of the summer holiday season.
You might think that flirting with a reputation for chaos and cancellations would hurt an airline reliant on 
discretionary travel. The schedule cuts will have some financial impact. EasyJet cautioned capacity would be lower 
than expected and costs higher; projections by analysts at Peel Hunt and Goodbody of a profit for this year flipped 
to a loss.
But all that seems to be outweighed by consumers' desperation to get away. Chief executive Johan Lundgren says 
disruption has had no impact on demand, with bookings for July to September in line with 2019. Barclaycard data 
showed this month that consumers lifted spending with airlines and travel agents in May despite April's issues, even 
as they cut back elsewhere.
And despite months of bad headlines almost all analysts have a "buy" rating on the stock, S&P Global data show.
Most airlines have received some share price punishment for cancellations, reckons Peel Hunt's Alexander 
Paterson - even those that haven't cut any flights.
Analysts are worried about the effects of rising fuel prices and a consumer downturn, not the potential for a 
reputational hit to dent demand. Since this year's earnings will be blighted by
Covid-19, airlines are priced on next year's instead. EasyJet appears more appealing than most.
Low-cost carriers tend to hold up better than flag carriers during recessions, since consumers trade down rather 
than stay home, Morgan Stanley analysts noted last month. Airlines' performance during periods of high oil prices 
caused by external shocks is less encouraging, with margins likely to suffer if weakening consumer demand leaves 
airlines constrained on pricing. But even then, Morgan Stanley reckoned easyJet and Ryanair looked the best of the 
bunch, with most upside in a steady recovery and least downside in a downturn.
EasyJet also has, in the words of HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg, "decent fuel and US dollar hedging", unlike 
budget rival Wizz, which was late to hedge as the oil price climbed. EasyJet's focus on western Europe has also 
helped it dodge wavering demand for destinations in central and eastern Europe after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
EasyJet is the beneficiary of an acronym familiar to plenty of equity market investors of recent years: Tina, or There 
Is No (good) Alternative. Passengers lack many better options. So too do airline investors.

The Federation said it expects 'the chaos the aviation sector is currently facing will only grow over the summer as 
workers are pushed to the brink.' 
- Aviation sector 'chaos' - 
In Spain, trade unions have urged Ryanair cabin crews to strike from June 24 to July 2 to secure their 'fundamental 
labour rights' and 'decent work conditions for all staff'. 
Ryanair staff in Portugal plan to go on strike from Friday to Sunday to protest work conditions, as are employees in 
Belgium. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has been dismissive of the strikes. 
More strike calls cloud summer for European low-cost airlines
'We operate two and half thousand flights every day,' he said earlier this month in Belgium. 
'Most of those flights will continue to operate even if there is a strike in Spain by some Mickey Mouse union or if the 
Belgian cabin crew unions want to go on strike over here,' he added in a media conference. 
But Ryanair pilots in Belgium decided over the weekend to join cabin crew in a strike from Friday. 
Meanwhile, staff at Brussels Airlines, a Lufthansa unit, have called a three-day strike from Thursday. 
In Italy, a 24-hour strike is set to hit Ryanair operations on Saturday with pilots and cabin crew calling for the airline 
to respect the minimum wages set for the sector under a national agreement.  
Airports have also been plagued by staff shortages, which have caused long lines at check-in counters and security 
checks, provoking the ire of travellers. 
On Monday, a strike by security agents caused the cancellation of all departures from Brussels' Zaventem airport. 
Cleaning staff at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport temporarily stopped working on Monday after missing out on a 
bonus. 
At Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, one of Europe's largest, staff are set to strike from July 1.

Will easyJet customers choose reputation or cost?

It's safe to say that the last couple of months have been tough for easyJet PLC.
One of Britain's biggest budget airlines has already been forced to cancel thousands of flights this year, with staff 
shortages brought on by Covid cited as the main reason.
Naturally, this has led to nightmare holidays, with many customers stranded for days abroad, albeit in popular 
holiday destinations like Milan and Ibiza
Today, it announced that it will be culling further flights over the summer, with Gatwick Airport introducing a flight 
cap to help deal with its own staff shortages.
easyJet so far has continued to entice customers in with its cheaper than most prices, despite it not having the 
greatest reputation at even the best of times.
However, leaving thousands of customers stranded abroad or forcing them to miss their holiday isn't the best look 
for an airline, and it may be the straw that breaks the camel's back.
Cost over reputation?
As mentioned above, easyJet and other budget airlines such as Ryanair have managed to remain successful 
because of how cheap it is to use their service.
Consequentially, it's never really had to worry about its reputation too much.
Will easyJet customers choose reputation or cost?
And, despite all the cancellations, some industry experts don't think any permanent damage has been done to 
easyJet yet.
"easyJet is not the only airline to take a battering in current media coverage," said John Strickland, director at air 
transport consultancy JLS Consulting.
"It is well aware of its need to improve performance and is taking further action."
"A number of factors are outside of its control such as recent ATC challenges at Gatwick airport where easyJet has 
its highest concentration of activity."  
"Without underestimating the anger of disrupted customers, based on the experience of the whole covid pandemic 
and other serious disruptions affecting airlines and assuming that operational integrity is recovered in the coming 
months I do not expect permanent long-term damage to easyJet's reputation," Strickland added.
That belief is supported by Simon Wandsworth, a managing partner at online reputation management firm Igniyte.
Wandsworth adds that "people understand it's a wider issue beyond just the airlines."
"I think the thing that people want most is notice and if they (easyJet) are mindful of this then this will limit the long-
term impact on their reputation."
For the time being, it seems customers will continue to put price above reputation when deciding on who to fly with.
That isn't to say however that, should the situation worsen, travelling Brits will start to look elsewhere.
Shares fell 0.6% to 434.6p.

Irish ultra-low-cost carrier Ryanair has launched hundreds of additional 'rescue flights' to support passengers whose 
flights have been canceled by British Airways, easyJet, and TUI.
According to statement issued by the airline on June 20, 2022, Ryanair will offer 200 'rescue flights' on its routes 
from 19 UK airports to Europe "to facilitate UK families whose flights are being cancelled by BA, easyJet & TUI" due 
to staff shortages.
"While British Airways, easyJet, and TUI cancel thousands of flights disrupting the holiday plans of UK families, 
Ryanair is operating over 15,000 weekly flights and has added over 1,000 extra flights for July and August of 2022," 
the statement continues.
According to Ryanair's director of marketing and communications, Dara Brady, the initiative is expected to end in 
September 2022. However, Brady warned that flight bookings will only be accepted until June 23, 2022.
"UK families can now rest easy in the knowledge that Ryanair will fly them to and from their summer holiday 
destination to enjoy some well-deserved time off with friends and family," Brady said.
Multiple European airlines have already cut their summer season flight schedules due to staff shortages which 
continue to plague the aviation industry.

easyJet has successfully fended off fellow UK low-fare carrier, Ryanair, to be awarded 18 daily slots at Lisbon 
airport. This now makes it the second-largest carrier operating at the airport, and takes over the take-off and landing 
slots that were currently held by TAP Air Portugal. The Portuguese flag carrier airline ceded the slots after 
undergoing restructuring, which left space for the UK low-fare carriers to fight it out.
The additional slots will be implemented from the end of October, at the beginning of the winter season (from 30th 
October 2022).
"The decision means that easyJet will be able to offer a wider choice in destinations and affordable fares for people 
travelling to and from the Portuguese capital. It also confirms the airline's key role in the Portuguese market and will 
create additional local employment opportunities. The additional capacity enabled by the new slots will be deployed 
starting in October," the airline said in a statement.
Easyjet currently serves five airports in Portugal, namely: Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Funchal, and Porto Santo. The last of 
which, Faro, it opened in 2021.

THE WEEKEND Kraków has been one of Europe's best-kept secrets for decades, its mixture of old world charm 
and art-flecked cool drawing those in the know for getaways to see ancient architecture, drink copious cocktails, or 
indeed both. The secret, it seems, is out - the city's biggest airline, Ryanair has announced that it's opening 10 new 
routes to the city, expecting to serve 4.5 million passengers this year alone. So it's never been easier to visit this 
amazing city.
WHERE? The city's medieval Old Town was one of the world's first UNESCO World Heritage sites. This strip of 
ancient architecture has been transformed over the years into a gorgeous, twisting gauntlet of bars, restaurants, 
museums and hotels. It's surrounded by the wonderful Planty Park, a ring of pleasant, unerringly quiet greenery 
buffering the ancient town from Kraków's more modern extrusions. Set just outside Kraków's Jewish quarter, and 
home to its younger, artier, more experimental population, not to mention its younger, artier, more experimental 
eateries and bars. As a onetwo punch, the Old Town and Kazimierz offer a perfect long weekend - culture and 
adventure alike, within a 15 minute walk.
THE STAY Bullseyed in the very centre of the Old Town is the Bonerowski Palace Hotel, a five-star ode to Kraków's 
history as the seat of Polish royalty. The first thing you'll notice as you enter is a four-storey chandelier, which 
ascends the stairs with you. Follow it to the top and you'll find a penthouse suite built out of more window than wall, 
overlooking the square below and covered in enough thick drapes to make a regency heiress faint in delight. Decor 
is pitched somewhere in between a tribute to the 13th Century palace it's built in, and the wild tastes of a cartoon 
oligarch, complete with a bath sitting in the middle of the room, a reading nook up its own flight of stairs, and a 
shower the size of a small family car. Downstairs, you'll find a smart, compact cocktail bar and the Amalia 
KRAKOW BONEROWSKI PALACE HOTEL; Joe Skrebels discovers an ideal summer escape in the Polish 
capital
restaurant, which offers a la carte breakfasts, and classy takes on Polish standards. Grab a booth by the windows 
and you can spend a relaxing evening watching the square bustle by, complete with classical horse and carriage 
rides departing from just outside.
THE FOOD Kraków is blessed with a vibrant restaurant culture, from incredible hole-in-the-wall pierogi sellers 
turning out dumplings the weight of a cricket ball, to artful sushi that simply shouldn't be this good for a town 
hundreds of miles from the sea. For a true taste of the Old Town, however, Wesele Restaurant offers refined Polish 
fare, with specials tied to national holidays. Griddle pans heave with perfectly cooked black pudding and bacon, 
traditional roast duck comes with swipes of delicate apple mousse and edible flowers, and the meal is finished with 
a choice of Polish flavoured vodka, displayed proudly in the centre of the room.
ASK ABOUT Kraków is well-armed with museums and galleries, but for something more unusual, the aptly-named 
Beernarium hides underneath an unassuming Old Town side street, offering luxurious baths in either beer or wine, 
accompanied by a sauna and a traditional hay bed to lay on. Truly odd, but oddly wonderful.
NEED TO KNOW Bonerowski Palace Hotel suites start at around £270 a night. www.Palacbonerowski.com
TOP TIP If you're extremely hungry, make sure to visit Plac Nowy in Kazimierz, a square dominated by food stalls 
vying to make the best Zapiekanki.
They're gigantic open sandwiches often referred to as "Polish Pizza"

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) entered into a revised post-COVID-19 pay restoration deal with the BALPA trade union, as over 
70% of its pilots are now covered by newly renegotiated agreements, Reuters reported Monday, citing the union 
and the airline's spokesperson. 
The deal was signed after the British airline pilots' trade union voted to accept temporary pay cuts to prevent layoffs 
in July 2020 after the pandemic heavily impacted the aviation industry. 
Meanwhile, unions representing cabin crew in Belgium, Portugal, France and Italy are gearing up to go on strike 
between one and three days each later this week.
Ryanair shares were up over 5% on Monday's close.

 Brussels Airport cancelled all outbound flights on Monday after most security staff joined a nationwide strike for 
better pay as soaring inflation hit workers' purchasing power. 
The stoppage kicked off a week of travel chaos in several parts of Europe, notably a massive rail strike in Britain 
from Tuesday and, later on, strikes hitting the continent's biggest airline Ryanair in multiple countries. 
Brussels Airport informed passengers on its site and social media that all departing flights were scrapped for the 
day — 232 in total. 
Only a quarter of arriving flights were still operating. Freight traffic was unaffected. 
The departure hall at the airport was largely empty, with only around 100 passengers inside, some lining up to 
change tickets or get assistance while others slumped resignedly in seats or slept on the floor. 
Oleksandr Zayikin, a Ukrainian merchant mariner who had been away for four months, told AFP the strike had 
prevented a reunion with his wife in Istanbul. He had left before Russia's invasion of his country. 
'I'm upset,' the 29-year-old said, adding he would now probably find a Brussels hotel for a few days. 
'In Ukraine it's not a usual thing, we don't have such strikes. But I really respect that people do that,' he said. 
Maria Antonia, a20-year-old Romanian student who had a flight booked to return to Bucharest, didn't see the last-
minute messages the airport had written for passengers from late Sunday. 
'We didn't know it was cancelled until we got to the airport,' she said. 
'That was a little bit of a hassle. But we can manage it I think.' 
Passengers were told to contact their airline to reschedule their flights or seek a refund. 
German travel group TUI arranged to have flights that were to have left from Brussels take off from some regional 
Belgian airports. 
The national strike in Belgium was called by the three main unions to push for higher salaries as inflation sent the 
cost of living higher. 
A demonstration was to take place later Monday in the centre of Brussels, with unions expecting up to 70,000 
people to march.

 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] staff across various parts of Europe are planning to go on strike in late June as they 
seek improved pay and working conditions. This disruption during the peak summer travel period is a major blow to 
RYAAY, which has been seeing strengthening bookings and expects high summer fares and strong load factor[2]. 
Unions representing Ryanair's cabin crew are planning to go on strike in Belgium and Portugal from Jun 24 to Jun 
26, according to a Reuters report[3]. In France, they plan a strike from Jun 25 to Jun 26 and in Italy on Jun 25. 
Unions are also planning to go on strike in Spain on Jun 24, Jun 25, Jun 26, Jun 30, and Jul 1-Jul 2. Ryanair

A Ryanair spokesperson said that unions should try to negotiate for yielding improvements rather than disrupt 
Belgian customers' travel plans, the Reuters report stated. RYAAY CEO, Michael O'Leary, said that the union 
allegations were "complete rubbish." "We fully comply with Belgian law, we have labor agreements here with both 
the pilot unions and the cabin crew unions," O'Leary said at a news conference. During a strike in April, less than 
40% of Ryanair's Belgian flights were affected, O'Leary added. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks 
Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation[6] sector are as follows: 
Star Bulk Carriers SBLK[7] carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 7.1%. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
Shares of Star Bulk have gained more than 19% in a year. 
Golar LNG Limited GLNG[9] carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, 
having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed once, the 
average surprise being 42.1%. 
Shares of Golar LNG have rallied more than 64% in a year.

 When the 5th largest Economy in the World can spend 133 billion on nuclear weapons whilst NHS figures showed 
illnesses linked to Victorian poverty and lack of food were making a comeback, with cases of scurvy and 
malnutrition doubling since the Conservatives came to power, you know the people making the decisions are not 
doing the best job they can. 
The same people who told NHS staff that a 1% payrise was all they could afford while just writing off 11 billion of 
illegitimate Covid loans and burning 4 billion of PPE which they purchased but was unusable are now trying to say 
that the Train Staff who are striking next week are 'hurting the nations workers'. Not as much as you spaffing our 
money away it won't says every UK taxpayer. As much as they want to keep the focus on how much a train driver 
earns compared to everyone else, therefore pitting workers against each other, the strike is also about safety as job 
cuts hit and the reduction of the terms and conditions in their contracts but it isn't just getting on a train which will be 
tougher this summer, so will travelling on a bus or plane and getting your bins emptied as the UK Summer of 
Discontent takes hold. The list includes rail strikes along with tube and tram services and British Airways airport 
staff are being balloted on industrial action with Ryanair and easyJet already agreeing to walk outs as have Arriva 
buses which affects most of the northern half of the country. Post Office staff have firmed up their dates for 
upcoming strike action and waste is piling up on some streets as Bin workers across the country are set to continue 
their strike in what they are calling the 'summer of stink'. Civil Service Union, PCS, is balloting members on a 
striking for three days over job cuts as are the unions for BT, Openreach and EE staff so things could be about to 
get very uncomfortable, and smelly, very quickly.

Foreigners pay more for gas in Hungary . It risks an EU fight

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary has discounted the price of gasoline at the pump. But not if you have a 
foreign license plate.
It's also taxing what it calls “extra profits” of industries including airlines, with carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet 
increasing ticket prices to cope.
The nationalist government argues that it's trying to ease an economic downturn and the highest inflation in nearly 
25 years amid Russia's war in Ukraine, but the unusual moves by the central European country are alienating 
companies and threatening a renewed standoff with the European Union.
With these interventionist measures, which also include price caps on some food items, right-wing populist Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban is jettisoning the conservative financial model of deregulation and free market capitalism.
The policies have helped lower some prices for Hungarians, but some multinational and domestic companies say 
they are damaging their bottom lines and competitiveness. Meanwhile, the EU has raised questions of whether the 
policies comply with its rules, following clashes between the 27-nation bloc and Hungary over rule-of-law concerns 
and corruption.
The EU takes issue with a requirement introduced in May that drivers with foreign license plates pay market prices 
for fuel at Hungarian gas stations, blocking them from purchasing gas and diesel that has been capped at 480 
forints ($1.25) per liter since November.
Representing a price hike of as much as 60% for drivers with vehicles registered in other countries, the EU asked 
Hungary to scrap the requirement until it could determine if it complies with the bloc's rules or face legal action, 
calling it “discriminatory.”
The fuel price cap gave Hungary among the lowest fuel prices in the EU, leading to fuel tourism and increased 
demand that caused lagging supply and shortages.
Foreigners pay more for gas in Hungary . It risks an EU fight
“The government had to act, but instead of opting for a more market-friendly solution, they have opted for 
something which goes straight against the values of the European Union,” Gyorgy Suranyi, an economist and 
former governor of Hungary’s central bank told The Associated Press.
In a radio interview last week, Orban blamed the war in neighboring Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia for 
Hungary’s economic woes: its currency has weakened to record levels and core inflation soared to 12.2% in May. In 
comparison, consumer prices rose 8.1% in the 19 countries using the euro.
“We’re now in a wartime situation, and this must be resolved,” Orban said. “(Companies) will have to shoulder more 
of the burden than they normally do because Hungarian families cannot pay the price for this.”
His government, also facing a spiraling budget deficit after spending billions on handouts ahead of elections in April, 
said industries from banking to insurance to airlines that have enjoyed “extra profits” arising from soaring demand 
after the pandemic should contribute to the economic recovery.
It's imposing a windfall profits tax July 1 that lasts through next year, hoping to raise 815 billion forints ($2.1 billion) 
to maintain a flagship program that reduces people's utility bills and bolster Hungary's military.
Some targeted industries like fossil fuels and banking are making higher-than-usual profits, but most are not, 
Suranyi said.
“This is not a windfall tax, this is a confiscation of the capital of these companies, which goes against the rule of 
law,” he said. “The airlines have definitely no windfall revenue.”
Several commercial airlines agree. The CEO of Ireland-based budget carrier Ryanair called the tax “highway 
robbery.”
"We call on (Hungary's government) to reverse this idiotic ‘excess profits’ tax, or at least confine it to industries like 
oil or gas who are making windfall profits, and not airlines who are reporting record losses,” CEO Michael O’Leary 
said in a statement.
Ryanair, along with British low-cost airline EasyJet and Hungary-based budget carrier Wizz Air, said they would add 
around 10 euros (dollars) to each ticket to cover the costs of the new tax.
Hungarian commercial bank K&H Bank said it too would raise its fees.
A government statement said companies should not pass along the costs to customers because “Hungarian 
families should not have to pay the price of the war.”
"The government has already indicated that it will carry out a thorough investigation of each suspected case and 
will take firm action against harmful practices,” the statement reads.
Hungary has launched a consumer protection investigation against Ryanair for increasing ticket prices.
Some Hungarians, who earn among the lowest wages in the EU, say the reduced fuel prices are keeping them 
afloat as costs of other goods, especially food, keep rising.
“I think it’s good for us, but I’m not sure it’s sustainable in the long term,” Nikoletta Palhidi, a nurse from the village 
of Hetes, said recently as she fueled her car. “I don’t know that the state can keep this all up.”
Jozsef Toth, a retired farmer from a small village in southwest Hungary, said that alongside his meager pension of 
around $250 per month, the gasoline price cap has eased the burden. But he wasn't sure about charging foreign 
vehicles more for fuel.
“It’s good for us, but it’s a bit strange that the foreigners have to pay more. If we would go (to their countries), they’d 
sell it to us for more," he said.
Foreigners pay more for gas in Hungary . It risks an EU fight
While drivers have experienced relief, the owners of small gas stations are seeing significant shortfalls as they 
make no profit, said Janos Baintner, owner of a small filling station in Somogyvar in southwest Hungary.
Baintner said the price cap has caused him a deficit of around 2 million forints ($5,200) per month since November 
and that it has endangered the livelihoods of around 10,000 families that rely on work at small filling stations.
“If our profit margins are guaranteed, then we agree that fuel should be cheap in the interests of protecting 
families," Baintner said. "But we shouldn’t be the ones to pay the price.”
Suranyi, the former governor of Hungary's central bank, agreed.
“I do have sympathy, if there is room for maneuvering, for reducing the burden on individual households once such 
external shocks arrive,” he said. “But to reduce the burden, the reasonable approach is definitely not a price cap.”

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) said it fully complies with domestic laws after its Belgium-based workers alleged otherwise and 
threatened a strike next week. 
Reuters reported Friday citing a spokesperson that Ryanair has labor agreements with pilot and cabin crew unions, 
and that they should restart negotiations instead of stopping work. 
The ACV and BBTK unions said the June 24-26 strikes are due to the airline refusing to engage on issues such as 
minimum wage compliance and pay for certain pre- and post-flight work.
Ryanair is also facing strikes in Spain, Portugal, France and Italy. 
The stock was up more than 2% in recent trade.

 An sign at a petrol station gives information on the discount of fuel, in Budapest, Hungary, Sunday, June 12, 2022. 
Hungary has placed price caps on fuel and some food and imposed special taxes on industries as the government 
tries to ease an economic downturn and the highest inflation in nearly 25 years. (AP Photo/Anna Szilagyi) 
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary has discounted the price of gasoline at the pump. But not if you have a 
foreign license plate.  
It's also taxing what it calls 'extra profits' of industries including airlines, with carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet 
increasing ticket prices to cope. 
The nationalist government argues that it's trying to ease an economic downturn and the highest inflation in nearly 
25 years amid Russia's war in Ukraine, but the unusual moves by the central European country are alienating 
companies and threatening a renewed standoff with the European Union.  
With these interventionist measures, which also include price caps on some food items, right-wing populist Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban is jettisoning the conservative financial model of deregulation and free market capitalism. 
The policies have helped lower some prices for Hungarians, but some multinational and domestic companies say 
they are damaging their bottom lines and competitiveness. Meanwhile, the EU has raised questions of whether the 
policies comply with its rules, following clashes between the 27-nation bloc and Hungary over rule-of-law concerns 
and corruption.  
The EU takes issue with a requirement introduced in May that drivers with foreign license plates pay market prices 
for fuel at Hungarian gas stations, blocking them from purchasing gas and diesel that has been capped at 480 
forints ($1.25) per liter since November. 
Representing a price hike of as much as 60% for drivers with vehicles registered in other countries, the EU asked 
Hungary to scrap the requirement until it could determine if it complies with the bloc's rules or face legal action, 
calling it 'discriminatory.' 
The fuel price cap gave Hungary among the lowest fuel prices in the EU, leading to fuel tourism and increased 
demand that caused lagging supply and shortages. 
'The government had to act, but instead of opting for a more market-friendly solution, they have opted for something 
which goes straight against the values of the European Union,' Gyorgy Suranyi, an economist and former governor 
of Hungary's central bank told The Associated Press. (Ad) This guide will help you identify and execute an options 
trading strategy that fits your specific needs and risk profile.  
Take your trading to the next level with the Options Strategy Guide. 
Foreigners pay more for gas in Hungary . It risks an EU fight
In a radio interview last week, Orban blamed the war in neighboring Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia for 
Hungary's economic woes: its currency has weakened to record levels and core inflation soared to 12.2% in May. In 
comparison, consumer prices rose 8.1% in the 19 countries using the euro. 
'We're now in a wartime situation, and this must be resolved,' Orban said. '(Companies) will have to shoulder more 
of the burden than they normally do because Hungarian families cannot pay the price for this.'  
His government, also facing a spiraling budget deficit after spending billions on handouts ahead of elections in April, 
said industries from banking to insurance to airlines that have enjoyed 'extra profits' arising from soaring demand 
after the pandemic should contribute to the economic recovery. 
It's imposing a windfall profits tax July 1 that lasts through next year, hoping to raise 815 billion forints ($2.1 billion) 
to maintain a flagship program that reduces people's utility bills and bolster Hungary's military. 
Some targeted industries like fossil fuels and banking are making higher-than-usual profits, but most are not, 
Suranyi said. 
'This is not a windfall tax, this is a confiscation of the capital of these companies, which goes against the rule of 
law,' he said. 'The airlines have definitely no windfall revenue.' 
Several commercial airlines agree. The CEO of Ireland-based budget carrier Ryanair called the tax 'highway 
robbery.'  
"We call on (Hungary's government) to reverse this idiotic 'excess profits' tax, or at least confine it to industries like 
oil or gas who are making windfall profits, and not airlines who are reporting record losses,' CEO Michael O'Leary 
said in a statement. 
Ryanair, along with British low-cost airline EasyJet and Hungary-based budget carrier Wizz Air, said they would add 
around 10 euros (dollars) to each ticket to cover the costs of the new tax.  
Hungarian commercial bank K&H Bank said it too would raise its fees. 
A government statement said companies should not pass along the costs to customers because 'Hungarian 
families should not have to pay the price of the war.'  
"The government has already indicated that it will carry out a thorough investigation of each suspected case and 
will take firm action against harmful practices,' the statement reads. 
Hungary has launched a consumer protection investigation against Ryanair for increasing ticket prices.  
Some Hungarians, who earn among the lowest wages in the EU, say the reduced fuel prices are keeping them 
afloat as costs of other goods, especially food, keep rising.  
'I think it's good for us, but I'm not sure it's sustainable in the long term,' Nikoletta Palhidi, a nurse from the village of 
Hetes, said recently as she fueled her car. 'I don't know that the state can keep this all up.'  
Jozsef Toth, a retired farmer from a small village in southwest Hungary, said that alongside his meager pension of 
around $250 per month, the gasoline price cap has eased the burden. But he wasn't sure about charging foreign 
vehicles more for fuel.  
'It's good for us, but it's a bit strange that the foreigners have to pay more. If we would go (to their countries), they'd 
sell it to us for more," he said.  
While drivers have experienced relief, the owners of small gas stations are seeing significant shortfalls as they 
make no profit, said Janos Baintner, owner of a small filling station in Somogyvar in southwest Hungary. 
Baintner said the price cap has caused him a deficit of around 2 million forints ($5,200) per month since November 
and that it has endangered the livelihoods of around 10,000 families that rely on work at small filling stations.  
'If our profit margins are guaranteed, then we agree that fuel should be cheap in the interests of protecting families," 
Baintner said. "But we shouldn't be the ones to pay the price.'  
Suranyi, the former governor of Hungary's central bank, agreed.  
'I do have sympathy, if there is room for maneuvering, for reducing the burden on individual households once such 
external shocks arrive,' he said. 'But to reduce the burden, the reasonable approach is definitely not a price cap.'  
7 Small-Cap Stocks that Present Long-Term Growth Opportunities[1] Before you invest in small-cap stocks, you 
should be comfortable with the risk that they present. By definition, a small-cap stock is one that has a market 
capitalization of less than $2 billion. But this leaves them prone to volatility. And when the market goes through a 
sell-off or correction these stocks can suffer steep losses. 
Those concerns are being amplified as the Federal Reserve is pledging to raise interest rates as part of their efforts 
to implement a less accommodative monetary policy. And that means if your investment timeline ends in the next 
few years, you may want to look elsewhere.

However, if you have a longer time horizon, quality small-cap stocks have historically provided investors with an 
opportunity for high growth. In this special presentation, we're looking at seven small-cap stocks. Some have an 
interesting story that is playing out right now. Others have a narrative that should provide a catalyst for the stock 
once the economy is back on firm footing. 
Here are seven small-cap stocks we believe deserve a closer look.

Ryanair drops controversial language test for South African travellers

Ryanair has dropped its controversial language test for South African travellers.
The Dublin-based airline has changed its policy requiring South African travellers to the UK to pass a quiz in 
Afrikaans after anger erupted earlier this month.
"Our team issued a test in Afrikaans of 12 simple questions," like naming the mountains outside the capital city 
Pretoria, CEO Michael O'Leary told a press conference in Brussels on Tuesday.
"They have no difficulty completing that. But we didn't think it was appropriate either," he added.
"So we have ended the Afrikaans test because it doesn't make any sense."
Reports of the questionnaire began circulating earlier this month, sparking anger on social media.
The South African government said it was taken aback by Ryanair's controversial policy which required people to 
prove their nationality with an Afrikaans language test.
 Last week, the Department of Home Affairs described the budget airline's testing of UK-bound South African 
passengers as a "backward profiling system."
Afrikaans is used by just 12 per cent of the population and has long been identified with apartheid and the white 
minority.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers - which does not operate flights to and from South Africa - said it 
was asking those flying to the UK to fill in the "simple questionnaire" due to what it described as a high prevalence 
of fraudulent South African passports.
"If they are unable to complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund," a 
spokesman for the Irish airline said.
Ryanair said it would apply to any South African passport holder flying to Britain from another part of Europe on the 
carrier.
Ryanair drops controversial language test for South African travellers
How did South Africa respond to the Afrikaans quiz?
In response to the introduction of the quiz, the Department of Home Affairs said the local government had 
measures that it regularly shares with airlines to curb any instances of fake documents.
"We are taken aback by the decision of this airline because the Department regularly communicates with all airlines 
to update them on how to validate South African passports, including the look and feel," it said.
All airlines have access to the 'Advanced Passenger Processing' system which enables them to screen travellers 
before they depart and the government also runs a 24-hour service that airlines can use if they want to authenticate 
South African passports, the department added.
"It is not clear to what extent the airline has used these services before resorting to this backward profiling system."
Aviation analyst Alex Macheras described the move as "categorically insane and discriminatory" on Sunday.
"Given a higher prevalence of fake travel documents *globally* will Ryanair also be requiring Brits to complete a 
Latin test prior to boarding? No," he added on Twitter.
"Currently, this insane policy only targets South African passport holders."
Why has Ryanair's Afrikaans rule caused offence?
Afrikaans is the third most spoken of 11 official languages in South Africa, used by 12 per cent of the 58 million 
people in the country. It was considered the official language until the end of apartheid in 1994.
The language was born of Dutch settlement in South Africa in the 17th century, and has long been identified with 
racial classification and associated with the ideology of apartheid which was primarily enforced and propagated by 
the white minority National Party from 1948.
Its dominance under apartheid was seen as a symbol of inequality imposed on previous generations by restrictions 
on where people could live, work, go to school and own land.

Leaked union email says easyJet staff face 'serious safety risk'
Leaked union email says easyJet staff face 'serious safety risk'

The UK's second-largest union has slammed easyJet flight cancellations in a scathing email obtained by Euronews.
In a letter to easyJet's leadership team, Unite - which represents 60,000 aviation workers - demanded to know why 
the carrier was being forced to cancel dozens of flights per day and hadn't proactively reduced its schedule in 
advance.
The union also accused the company's embattled Chief Operating Officer (COO) Peter Bellew of only 
communicating with staff twice in almost three months, despite widespread chaos.
"This level of disruption and deterioration of the operation cannot continue," the email reads.
"It is a serious safety risk to crew members and is having a disastrous effect on the easyJet brand.
"We feel there is a lack of leadership from within the business. We would expect you, our Chief Operating Officer, to 
be taking control of this situation."
The news comes after another suite of cancellations, with easyJet on Monday axing 64 flights to or from UK 
airports, a mass disruption impacting around 10,000 passengers.
Why is easyJet cancelling so many flights?
In recent weeks, many airlines have seen their schedules disrupted by staff shortages and airport chaos.
Most carriers reduced their workforces in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, easyJet revealed it 
would cut its workforce by 30 per cent, compared with Ryanair's 15 per cent and Wizz Air's planned staff reduction 
of 19 per cent.
EasyJet say that in the end they cut 13 per cent of staff.
Faced with a surge in travel, the airline is struggling. In an attempt to reduce staff shortages, easyJet has 
announced it will offer existing staff a £1,000 ((EURO)1,160) bonus at the end of the summer holiday season.
Leaked union email says easyJet staff face 'serious safety risk'
But until recently, the carrier hadn't pre-emptively cancelled large numbers of flights. Instead, it has been forced to 
make dozens of on-the-day cancellations.
By contrast, British Airways announced in March that it would be cancelling up to 10 per cent of its flight schedule 
between March and October.
Though the news upended thousands of holiday plans, it has helped the airline to limit the extent and effect of any 
on-the-day cancellations.
EasyJet's approach was criticised by Unite, who said: "We are concerned how much the company are currently 
spending on issuing EU261 claims due to the large number of cancellations."
"If proactive steps were taken sooner, then the constant negative media coverage would cease to have effect."
Some staff are, reportedly, unwillingly working into discretion or days off, Unite claims, because "they're aware that 
there's a high chance that the flight will be cancelled if they don't due to below-par standby coverage."
In response, easyJet pledged that safety was the airline's number one priority, a message that is "repeated 
frequently at all levels of management."
EasyJet crew know it is up to them to decide if they are fit or unfit to operate, the airline claimed.
Will easyJet change its strategy to end the travel chaos?
In a sign that easyJet may be reviewing its strategy for summer 2022, the airline announced on Sunday that it 
would be cancelling 40 flights a day for the rest of June.
The move is designed to reduce last-minute cancellations and brings easyJet's approach for June in line with that of 
other airlines.
"Making these cancellations is not something we take lightly but what's worse is to cancel our customers' plans on 
the day that they are ready to fly," Bellew said.
Multiple unions had urged easyJet to get a grip on its cancellations, warning that airline staff feel the heat of 
customers' anger at last minute cancellations.
Easyjet insisted it had a "continuous and open dialogue" with its unions and crew, and confirmed it would be 
responding to Unite's letter directly.
The airline added: "There are industry-wide operational issues that are impacting airlines at the moment, which 
means we have made a number of pre-emptive cancellations.
"Delivering a safe and reliable operation for our customers and crew is our airline's highest priority."
In the email, Unite asked that senior management communicate better with staff.
"[We call for] dedicated communication [from management to crew] that we now feel should be sent daily, including 
on weekends," they write.
This would provide the "ideal opportunity" for Bellew to restore customer confidence in easyJet as well as "gain 
some much-needed ground to secure the trust" of staff.
The union also asked for a "more informative, accurate and friendly" announcement style for service updates, in the

The UK's second-largest union has slammed easyJet flight cancellations in a scathing email obtained by Euronews.
In a letter to easyJet's leadership team, Unite - which represents 60,000 aviation workers - demanded to know why 
the carrier was being forced to cancel dozens of flights per day and hadn't proactively reduced its schedule in 
advance.
The union also accused the company's embattled Chief Operating Officer (COO) Peter Bellew of only 
communicating with staff twice in almost three months, despite widespread chaos.
"This level of disruption and deterioration of the operation cannot continue," the email reads.
"It is a serious safety risk to crew members and is having a disastrous effect on the easyJet brand.
"We feel there is a lack of leadership from within the business. We would expect you, our Chief Operating Officer, to 
be taking control of this situation."
The news comes after another suite of cancellations, with easyJet on Monday axing 64 flights to or from UK 
airports, a mass disruption impacting around 10,000 passengers.
Why is easyJet cancelling so many flights?
In recent weeks, many airlines have seen their schedules disrupted by staff shortages and airport chaos.
Most carriers reduced their workforces in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, easyJet revealed it 
would cut its workforce by 30 per cent, compared with Ryanair's 15 per cent and Wizz Air's planned staff reduction 
of 19 per cent.
EasyJet say that in the end they cut 13 per cent of staff.
Faced with a surge in travel, the airline is struggling. In an attempt to reduce staff shortages, easyJet has 
announced it will offer existing staff a £1,000 ((EURO)1,160) bonus at the end of the summer holiday season.
Leaked union email says easyJet staff face 'serious safety risk'
But until recently, the carrier hadn't pre-emptively cancelled large numbers of flights. Instead, it has been forced to 
make dozens of on-the-day cancellations.
By contrast, British Airways announced in March that it would be cancelling up to 10 per cent of its flight schedule 
between March and October.
Though the news upended thousands of holiday plans, it has helped the airline to limit the extent and effect of any 
on-the-day cancellations.
EasyJet's approach was criticised by Unite, who said: "We are concerned how much the company are currently 
spending on issuing EU261 claims due to the large number of cancellations."
"If proactive steps were taken sooner, then the constant negative media coverage would cease to have effect."
Some staff are, reportedly, unwillingly working into discretion or days off, Unite claims, because "they're aware that 
there's a high chance that the flight will be cancelled if they don't due to below-par standby coverage."
In response, easyJet pledged that safety was the airline's number one priority, a message that is "repeated 
frequently at all levels of management."
EasyJet crew know it is up to them to decide if they are fit or unfit to operate, the airline claimed.
Will easyJet change its strategy to end the travel chaos?
In a sign that easyJet may be reviewing its strategy for summer 2022, the airline announced on Sunday that it 
would be cancelling 40 flights a day for the rest of June.
The move is designed to reduce last-minute cancellations and brings easyJet's approach for June in line with that of 
other airlines.
"Making these cancellations is not something we take lightly but what's worse is to cancel our customers' plans on 
the day that they are ready to fly," Bellew said.
Multiple unions had urged easyJet to get a grip on its cancellations, warning that airline staff feel the heat of 
customers' anger at last minute cancellations.
Easyjet insisted it had a "continuous and open dialogue" with its unions and crew, and confirmed it would be 
responding to Unite's letter directly.
The airline added: "There are industry-wide operational issues that are impacting airlines at the moment, which 
means we have made a number of pre-emptive cancellations.
"Delivering a safe and reliable operation for our customers and crew is our airline's highest priority."
In the email, Unite asked that senior management communicate better with staff.
"[We call for] dedicated communication [from management to crew] that we now feel should be sent daily, including 
on weekends," they write.
This would provide the "ideal opportunity" for Bellew to restore customer confidence in easyJet as well as "gain 
some much-needed ground to secure the trust" of staff.
The union also asked for a "more informative, accurate and friendly" announcement style for service updates, in the 
hope that such a style would prevent customers from becoming angry at crew.

Ryanair has dropped an Afrikaans language test it imposed on South African travellers to the UK after it prompted 
ridicule and accusations of racial discrimination by Europe's biggest lowcost carrier.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the airline was ending the test, which required South African 
nationals to answer general knowledge questions in the nation's third most spoken language before they could 
board its planes, "because it doesn't make any sense".
South African travellers, many of whom do not speak Afrikaans, said they were baffled and humiliated by the test, 
which Ryanair had said was justified because of a rise in fake South African passports. South African nationals 
were refused entry to flights unless they answered the questions.
Ryanair's policy stirred painful memanniversary ories in South Africa, where Afrikaans was imposed on black South 
Africans under apartheid, and the democratic constitution today safeguards 11 official languages as a result.
The Pan South African Language Board said Ryanair's actions were "reminiscent of the old colonial and apartheid 
systematic subjugation of speakers of other languages, mainly black people, to racial and linguistic discrimination".
South Africa will mark today the of the 1976 Soweto uprising, when apartheid-era police brutally suppressed 
student protests against Afrikaans instruction in the Johannesburg township's schools.

O'Leary claimed travellers had "no difficulty completing" Afrikaans questions such as the name of South Africa's 
president and its highest mountain. "But we didn't think it was appropriate either," he said.
South Africa's home affairs ministry has recently highlighted cases of passport fraud that were allegedly abetted by 
its officials. It has said that it provides airlines with access to a screening system to quickly spot fake documents.
O'Leary said Ryanair incurred fines for allowing travellers with false identities on its planes.
South African travellers who took the test told the Financial Times the airline did not check other documents that 
would have verified their identity, such as visas and UK residency.

Ryanair drops Afrikaans test that angered South Africans

LONDON (AP) — Budget airline Ryanair says it has scrapped its controversial Afrikaans language test for South 
African travelers aimed at weeding out people with phony passports.
The Dublin-based airline changed its policy of requiring South African travelers to the U.K. to pass the quiz after the 
furor erupted earlier this month.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told a press conference in Brussels Tuesday that the test was being dropped, the 
BBC reported. The airline's press office confirmed his remarks.
“Our team issued a test in Afrikaans of 12 simple questions,” such as naming the mountain outside the capital 
Pretoria, O'Leary told reporters.
“They have no difficulty completing that. But we didn’t think it was appropriate either," he said. "So we have ended 
the Afrikaans test, because it doesn’t make any sense.”
Ryanair doesn't fly to or from South Africa but is Europe's biggest airline, carrying tens of millions of passengers 
between hundreds of cities annually.
Afrikaans is one of South Africa’s 11 official languages and is the first language of about 13% of the country’s 
population of nearly 60 million. It’s a Dutch-based language developed by many of the country’s white settlers who 
came from the Netherlands and is associated with South Africa’s apartheid regime of white minority rule that ended 
in 1994.
Reports of the questionnaire circulating on social media sparked anger among South Africans. The airline had said 
it needed passengers to pass the test because of the “high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports." 
South African passengers who could not pass the test were prevented from boarding and given a refund.

BA , easyJet among airlines told by govt to make new 'deliverable' summer schedules
BA, easyJet among airlines told by govt to make new 'deliverable' summer 
schedules

Airlines including British Airways and easyJet have been told by the government to cancel flights early to avoid 
airport chaos this summer.
The Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) told airline bosses to rejig plans for the 
remainder of the summer and "develop a schedule that is deliverable".
This followed between 2% and 4% of UK flights being cancelled during the recent half term and Platinum Jubilee 
weekend - up from the usual rate of 1%, according to the CAA.
Airline companies need schedules that "should be resilient for the unplanned and inevitable operational challenges 
that you will face", the joint letter said.
BA, which is owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG), easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings 
PLC (LSE:RYA), Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) and other carriers into and out of the UK must "keep 
consumers informed" about their rights during disruption.
Call centres should be "sufficiently staffed" and digital channels should be "user-friendly", to enable this process, 
the letter said.
Sue Davies, the head of consumer rights at consumer group Which?, yesterday accused airlines of letting down 
their customers, accusing them of "blatant flouting" of their obligations to customers and misleading behaviour in 
terms of providing compensation.
BA , easyJet among airlines told by govt to make new 'deliverable' summer schedules
Speaking to the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee in Westminster she said: "The 
airlines and the government were encouraging people to travel again, and we think they've just underestimated the 
capacity issues, and the shortages both within the airlines and the airport services, including baggage handlers."
With BA, easyJet and tour operator TUI cancelling a total of over 150 flights on some days in recent weeks, the 
airlines and the government have been blaming each other for the chaos.
Transport secretary Grant Shapps said travel firms had "seriously oversold flights and holidays relative to their 
capacity to deliver," while Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2, said ministers had a "scant" understanding of how 
the industry works and blamed the government for the disruption.

Holidaymakers could face yet more travel chaos after Spain's Ryanair cabin crew voted to hold six days of strikes 
over June and July.
Workers affiliated with two Spanish unions are set to walk out on 24, 25, 26 and 30 June, as well as on the first two 
days of July.
Staff want a deal that "guarantees decent work conditions for all personnel" at the airline, the USO and SITCPLA 
unions said in a joint statement.
 The strikes come as European airports and carriers struggle to cope with a surge in travel demand, with thousands 
of flights cancelled over the past month.
How will the Ryanair strike impact your holiday?
Ryanair operates out of more than 20 airports in Spain.
However, the budget carrier does not expect widespread disruption, a spokesperson said, as most staff are 
affiliated with different unions who have reached agreements with Ryanair.
"We believe that their [USO and SITCPLA unions] strike calls will not be supported by our Spanish crews," they 
commented.
 But the named Spanish unions claim otherwise. Both has threatened to coordinate action with other Ryanair staff in 
Belgium, France, Italy and Portugal.
The strike is the latest to beset European travel. Last week, industrial action forced multiple budget airlines - 
including Ryanair - to cancel flights to and from Italy, while a Thursday morning strike meant Paris-Charles de 
Gaulle airport had to scrap 100 flights.
This month, hundreds of British Airways staff at London's Heathrow will vote on whether or not to walk off the job to 
protest pay conditions.
Spain 's Ryanair cabin crew demand 'decent work conditions' in mass walkout
GMB - the union leading the UK strike action - has warned that British Airways will face a "gruelling summer of 
travel chaos" if the company doesn't offer staff a pay hike.
Why are European airports so busy?
Roughly 191,000 European aviation workers have been made redundant over the pandemic.
Now, as travel demand surges, airports and airlines are too short-staffed to handle the influx.
The airline industry has launched a recruitment drive, but Air Council International - Europe's trade body for airports 
- predicts that delays are inevitable at two-thirds of European airports this summer.
British Airways was forced to scrap 8,000 flights in its March-October schedule this year, while EasyJet has 
reduced its schedule by roughly 40 flights per day for the rest of June.
Airports are also feeling the heat. Security delays at Dublin Airport, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, and Manchester 
Airport have caused mammoth disruption for thousands of travellers.

Ryanair drops Afrikaans test after backlash from South African passengers

Low-cost carrier (LCC) Ryanair has removed its requirement for South African passengers to conduct a test in the 
Afrikaans language to prove their nationality before traveling to the United Kingdom.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary confirmed the change after the airline sparked a backlash from South 
African travelers, according to a report published by Reuters.
According to Reuters, the South African government labelled the procedure as a "backward profiling system".
However, O'Leary described South African government's profiling accusation as "rubbish" citing a surge in 
passengers carrying fake passports on its Turkey to Ireland route.
During a news conference in Brussels on June 14, 2022, O'Leary said: "The South African government have 
acknowledged that there's a problem with the vast number of false or fake South African passports."
In an earlier report from Reuters, dated June 7, the Department of Home Affairs in South Africa was cited as saying: 
"We are taken aback by the decision of this airline because the Department regularly communicates with all airlines 
to update them on how to validate South African passports, including the look and feel."
"Due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports, we require passengers traveling to the U.K. to fill 
out a simple questionnaire issued in Afrikaans," Ryanair wrote in a statement issued to AeroTime on June 7, 2022. 
"If they are unable to complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund."

Airlines ordered to cancel flights from the UK amid 'unacceptable' travel chaos
Airlines ordered to cancel flights from the UK amid 'unacceptable' travel 
chaos

The UK government has ordered airlines to cancel flights now, rather than later, to prevent last minute misery for 
travellers.
The demand comes after weeks of chaos across European airports, with thousands of holidaymakers facing delays, 
queues and cancellations.
In an open letter to airlines, The Department for Transport (DfT) and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) have warned 
carriers to trim schedules.
"Your schedules must be based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available," writes 
Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA, and Rannia Leontaridi, director-general for aviation at the DfT, write.
"(We recommend) cancellations at the earliest possibility to deliver a more robust schedule are better for 
consumers than late-notice on-the-day cancellations."
Many carriers have already slashed summer flight schedules to deal with understaffing. British Airways was recently 
forced to cancel 8,000 flights in its March-October schedule, while EasyJet has cut roughly 40 flights per day for the 
rest of the month.
The government's instruction could mean further cancellations for Britons travelling in July, August, and September.
 They are entitled to choose other departures - at the cost of the airline - or cancel and receive reimbursement.
How bad is the chaos facing British airlines?
Continuing airport chaos is still affecting thousands of British travellers with more widespread flight cancellations.
Yesterday, EasyJet confirmed it had cancelled all flights from the UK to Hurghada in Egypt until the end of July.
The airline apologised to travellers, blaming "industry-wide operational issues" for the decision.
Last week,Aviation strikes in Italy forced Ryanair and Jet2 having to cancel flights to the country.
Airlines ordered to cancel flights from the UK amid 'unacceptable' travel chaos
The chaos came to a head at the end of the half-term holiday.
During this bank holiday weekend, almost 200 flights into UK airports were cancelled from airlines including 
easyJet, British Airways and Wizz Air leaving passengers stuck abroad.
British Airways has also axed hundreds of short-haul flights, stressing that passengers affected were given 
advanced notice as these were part of a schedule reduction in place until October.
Further cancellations have added to the ongoing chaos leaving questions about whether the industry will be ready 
for the summer season.
Even without the scrapped flights, many travellers are facing long queues at security, baggage check-in and when 
reclaiming their luggage. Aviation bosses have blamed ongoing staff shortages and bad weather over the weekend 
for the disruption.
Who is to blame for the chaos at UK airports?
In the letter to airlines today, the DfT and CAA told airlines that current outcomes were "unacceptable."
"Our expectation is that you and all those involved in delivering aviation services will take all possible steps to 
prepare for and manage passenger demand that helps to avoid the unacceptable scenes we have recently 
witnessed."
London mayor Sadiq Khan said that Brexit was to blame for the chaos at Britain's airports. He called on the 
government to relax immigration rules so that airport and airline workers from the EU could return to the UK and 
avoid a summer of travel "misery."
But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps rejected the claims saying opening the door to "cheap" foreign workers 
wasn't the answer to relieving the pressure on the aviation sector.
He instead put the blame on industry bosses who he accused of "cutting too far" during the pandemic and not 
anticipating that so many people would return to international travel when restrictions were eased.
Shapps said that he will "do absolutely everything possible to make sure" that people can go abroad this summer 
without facing issues at airports. He added that he had already answered calls from the industry to speed up 
security checks for new staff and allow those in non-security related jobs to start training immediately.
A government and aviation industry working group has been formed ahead of the summer holidays to try and tackle 
delays and cancellations.
Should UK passengers be refunded for cancelled flights?
The Transport Secretary also said that holidaymakers should get automatic refunds for cancelled foreign holidays - 
much like they do for delayed domestic trains in the UK.
Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Morning programme earlier this month, he called for changes to allow "proper 
disputes resolution" with "quick and straightforward compensation" or a different flight.
"It can't be acceptable that it is so complicated sometimes to get a flight rearranged or to get your money back. I 
want it to be more like [how the national scheme] 'delay repay' works on trains, where it is an automated process."
Are there too many planes in European skies?
Earlier this month, Europe's air traffic agency warned that the number of flights in the coming months is likely to 
exceed the capacity of control centres. The problem is worse in Munich, Reims in France and Athens.

But according to Eurocontrol, much of Europe is now operating close to capacity with the agency urging countries to 
review their operations or face more sudden disruption this summer.

3 new Routes (5 total) with over 25 weekly flights
Ryanair, Europe and Poland's No.1 airline today (15th June) has announced its biggest ever Winter schedule for 
Lodz, including 3 new routes to Alicante, Brussels Charleroi, and Milan Bergamo. As Ryanair increases travel 
options for its Polish customers with over 25 weekly flights operating for Winter'22, the airline is committed to 
growing inbound and outbound traffic to Poland and Lodz.
Ryanair is driving post Covid-19 recovery across its network, where it can be seen that competitive airport charges 
and low fares can rapidly restore connectivity and tourism. Whilst legacy airlines who have received millions of 
euros in State aid continue to reduce capacity, Ryanair is growing its fleet with an order of 210 new B737 
"Gamechanger" aircraft, which burn 16% less fuel and 40% less noise emissions, while adding 4% more seats.
To allow our Polish customers and visitors to Lodz to book their next Winter getaway at the lowest possible fares, 
we are launching a seat sale with fares available from just 89 zl one way for travel from October 2022 until January 
2023, which must be booked by Friday, 17th June. Since these amazing low fares will be snapped up quickly, 
customers should log onto www.ryanair.com to avoid missing out.
In Lodz, Ray Kelliher, Ryanair's Director of Route Development, said:
"As Europe and Poland's No. 1 airline, Ryanair is delighted to announce its biggest ever schedule for Lodz this 
Winter, offering over 25 weekly flights across 5 routes, including 3 new routes to major destinations like Alicante, 
Brussels, and Milan.
This Summer, Lodz will also benefit from Ryanair growth, through our Polish airline Buzz, who will operate 3 weekly 
charters flights to both Antalya and Heraklion. We appreciate the hard work of the Airport and the City of Lodz in 
delivering this exciting network, which thanks to low fares and competitive airport costs will continue to grow over 
the coming seasons.
To allow our customers travel to/from Lodz at the lowest possible fares this Winter, we are launching a seat sale

Lodz Airport: Ryanair announces biggest ever W'22 schedule
Michal Kaczmarzyk, Buzz CEO, Ryanair Group airline said:
"Ryanair Group is increasing its presence in Lodz, not only by massive schedule growth this Summer and 
upcoming Winter but also by conducting pilot's training under the Ryanair Mentored Programme delivered by 
Bartolini Air. This is Ryanair's only mentored pilot scheme in Central Eastern Europe and the fastest way to achieve 
a pilot license and to start a career as a pilot in Poland".
Anna Midera, Ph.D. President of the Board and CEO of Lodz Airport:
"Each signal showing that we are back to the development path, especially after the pandemic and conflict in 
Ukraine, is particularly important. I am glad that Ryanair's development in Poland includes Lódz and Central 
Poland.
I have been managing the Lodz Airport for 5 years. The good cooperation with the local authorities and the 
business environment meant that we are taken into account in Ryanair's traffic development plans. It's very 
important because of that in less than one year, Lódz will become the aviation capital of Poland and Europe - the 
host of the European Air Traffic Development Forum - Routes Europe 2023.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has demanded that the government of Hungary scrap what it called an "unjustified" and 
"misguided" tax recently announced on airlines, to be imposed on departing passengers as part of efforts to fight 
inflation. When the carrier argued that it would be forced to pass on the "illogical" new windfall tax to consumers, 
Budapest reacted by ordering an immediate consumer protection probe into the company.
Viktor Orbán, who won a fourth consecutive term as Hungary's prime minister in early April, unveiled the new tax on 
May 25. He declared in a Facebook video at the time that the tax would be levied on "banks, insurers, large retail 
chains, energy and trading companies, telecommunications companies, and airlines" to counter price rises blamed 
on the war in neighbouring Ukraine, as well as to fund further defence spending.
The proclamation came a day after he introduced a state of emergency citing the same reasons. Money raised will 
go to two funds, he explained - one to strengthen the army, the other to enforce price caps on energy and water 
bills. The "sanctions policy in Brussels" against Russia in relation to the war has led to rising prices, he claimed, 
which together with high interest rates "are giving banks and large multinationals extra profits."
The taxes, worth HUF800 billion forints (USD2.1 billion), will apply for 2022 and 2023. For airlines, the new levy 
involves a tax of EUR10 to EUR25 euros (USD10.50-26.50) per passenger departing Hungary from July.
In a statement on June 8, Ryanair argued that the move "will irreparably damage Hungarian tourism, connectivity, 
traffic, and jobs." A new tax on the airline industry is "beyond stupid," it added, as the carrier itself "has just 
announced losses, yet the Govt is proposing a tax on 'extra profits', which are nonexistent due to Covid and the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine."
The "ill-timed and ill-advised" tax "inexplicably compares the loss-making aviation industry with hugely profitable oil 
and energy companies [and] has instantly made Hungary uncompetitive and less attractive to airlines and tourists." 
Ryanair will consequently "be forced to move growth capacity to those countries that are working to restore traffic."
Two days later, Hungary's government said it had launched a consumer protection investigation against Ryanair for 
pledging to pass the costs on to passengers. The probe will look into whether the carrier has been conducting unfair 
trade practices, the state-run news agency MTI reported.
Ryanair clashes with Hungary over "beyond stupid" tax
Márton Nagy, minister for economic development, told the news agency the government would do all it could to 
stop the costs of the windfall taxes from being passed on to consumers. He added: "It is especially adverse that 
Ryanair has started this practice with regard to tickets sold earlier. Investigations will be conducted in each and 
every case."
On June 14, Ryanair called on Nagy to explain why airlines are being levied a tax "to 'protect Hungarian families' 
when airlines are reporting record losses"; why "Hungarian families and visitors being asked to pay higher fares"; 
and "how does raising taxes on air travel 'help' Hungarian families? This is not an 'excess profits' tax, it is just 
highway robbery."
It added: "Ryanair welcomes the proposed consumer protection investigation and calls on Budapest City Council to 
extend this probe to investigate how the Hungarian Govt is introducing an 'excess profits' tax on a loss-making 
industry such as airlines. When the loss-making airlines are trying to recover from Covid and Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine, the last thing we or passengers need is an 'excess profits' tax. Perhaps Minister Nagy can explain why this 
idiotic tax is being imposed on the loss-making airline sector."
Ryanair subsidiary Buzz (Poland) is one of three passenger carriers currently operating a crew base at Budapest, 
the others being Smartwings (Hungary) and Wizz Air. Wizz and Ryanair dominate traffic at the airport, the ch-
aviation capacities module shows. Of the 34 passenger airlines currently operating there, the two LCCs have 
30.51% and 30.05% of the capacity, respectively. For Hungary in general (Debrecen and Sarmellek also see 
scheduled passenger flights), Wizz Air and Ryanair occupy 32.13% and 29.26% of the market.

The government and aviation regulator have ordered airlines to ensure all their advertised flights go ahead this 
summer, as industry bosses apologised for disruption in the half-term break. The Department for Transport and 
Civil Aviation Authority yesterday wrote a joint letter to the aviation industry that said "more needs to be done" to 
guarantee the summer season would not be affected by further interruptions after "unacceptable scenes" in recent 
weeks.
Airlines were told to cancel flights early rather than scrap them at the last minute, and to "review afresh" their plans 
for the summer to "develop a schedule that is deliverable".
The intervention came after senior industry officials conceded the recent wave of disruption was unacceptable, but 
warned that the industry was still suffering from staff shortages and there were no guarantees the problems would 
be solved by the summer holidays.
Between 2 and 4 per cent of UK flights were cancelled during the first week of May, compared with a normal rate of 
1 per cent, the CAA said.
Sophie Dekkers, chief commercial officer at EASYJET, the budget carrier, issued an apology to customers caught 
up in the recent problems. "We haven't got it right, and we need to get it right," she told a parliamentary select 
committee yesterday.
Airlines told to ensure summer flights go ahead Travel
"We definitely want to be better, no one wants to let customers down," Lisa Tremble, a senior executive at British 
Airways, told the hearing.
Tremble and other airline executives said many factors had contributed to the problems, including staff shortages 
and the uncertainty that was gripping the travel industry until as recently as March when the government loosened 
its remaining coronavirus travel rules. "The lack of certainty about where the industry was going to go and when has 
been a huge barrier to our recruitment," said Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association.
Airlines, airports and ground handlers were waiting for many new hires to pass through background security 
checks, including around 3,000 at BA, MPs were told.
Oliver Richardson, aviation lead at Unite, the union, said the number of flight cancellations "almost exactly 
corresponds" to staff cuts. He drew a comparison between BA, which shed 10,000 staff and has had to cut 10 per 
cent of its schedule this summer, and Ryanair, the budget carrier, which did not lose staff and has suffered far fewer 
cancellations.
"Both industry and government need to shoulder responsibility for the chaos we have seen," said Sue Davies, head 
of consumer rights at Which?, the consumer group.
As the government inquest into the disruption intensifies, On The Beach, an online travel agent, wrote to transport 
secretary Grant Shapps to demand a market review into the industry.
Low-cost airlines hold virtual monopolies on many routes, allowing them to "do as they please without 
consequences", Simon Cooper, On The Beach founder, wrote in the letter.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) is no longer requiring South African passengers to prove their nationality before travelling by 
completing a test in Afrikaans, according to Reuters. 
The policy elicited complaints among South Africans, and the South African government last week called the test a 
"backward profiling system."
Ryanair shares rose nearly 2% in US premarket trading on Wednesday.

 Ryanair has dropped a requirement for South African passengers to prove their nationality before travelling by 
completing a test in Afrikaans, the British budget airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary said after the policy 
caused a backlash[1] among South Africans. 
The South African government said last week it was taken aback by the low-cost carrier's decision to force UK-
bound travellers holding the country's passport to take the test, calling the move a 'backward profiling system'. 
Afrikaans is spoken by just 12 percent of the 58 million people in the country and often associated with the former 
white-led apartheid government. The country also has 11 official languages including Zulu, isiXhosa, Afrikaans, 
Sepedi, Setswana, English, Sesotho, Siswati and Ndebele. 
O'Leary, whose airline does not operate flights to and from South Africa but carries more passengers around 
Europe than anyone else, described the South African government's profiling accusation as 'rubbish' but said the 
test had been dropped. 
'The South African government have acknowledged that there's a problem with the vast number of false or fake 
South African passports,' O'Leary told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday, citing a surge in false South 
African passports on a route between Turkey and Ireland. 
'Our team issued a test in Afrikaans of 12 simple questions like what's the name of the mountain outside Pretoria? 
They have no difficulty completing that, but we didn't think it was appropriate either. So we have ended the 
Afrikaans test because [it] doesn't make any sense.' 
Last month, South African lawyer Zinhle Novazi faced the test, which included naming the highest mountain, its 
largest city and one national holiday, when travelling by Ryanair from Ibiza, Spain, to London on May 29. 
'I was able to answer the questions,' said Novazi, who learned Afrikaans in school but is not a native speaker of the 
language. She was then allowed to board the plane. 
The test triggered a backlash from South Africans in Johannesburg. 
'They're using this (test) in a manner that is utterly absurd,' Conrad Steenkamp, the chief executive officer of the 
Afrikaans Language Council, had said. 
The imposition of Afrikaans in schools was a principal reason behind the 1976 Soweto uprising against South 
Africa's apartheid regime. The protests were met with police brutality which led to at least 170 people being killed. 
The white minority rule ended in 1994, when Nelson Mandela became the first Black president of South Africa.

 As South Africans prepare to commemorate the 1976 Soweto Uprising, Ryanair's U-turn on making South Africans 
take tests in Afrikaans to prove their nationality comes far too late. Cai Nebe explores why.Ryainair boss Michael 
O'Leary's announcement that his airline would stop testing South African passport holders in Afrikaans before 
boarding is almost as ridiculous as the test itself was.  
"Our team issued a test in Afrikaans of 12 simple questions like what's the name of the mountain outside Pretoria? 
They have no difficulty completing that, but we didn't think it was appropriate either. So we have ended the 
Afrikaans test because doesn't make any sense," O'Leary told Reuters. 
It seems O'Leary himself is realizing just how nonsensical this bizarre scheme was, which Ryanair previously 
justified as the "least intrusive" way to catch fake passport holders. 
Allegedly a "substantially increased cases of fraudulent South African passports were being used to enter the 
United Kingdom."  
And after all, according to Ryanair, Afrikaans is a widely spoken language in South Africa and is one of the nation's 
11 constitutionally-recognized languages.  
Uprising against Afrikaans sparked anti-Apartheid struggle 
But using Afrikaans as a measure of 'how South African you are' drew an immediate backlash, because Afrikaans is 
not simply 'another official language'. 
Instead, for many South Africans, it is the language of the white oppressor and the Apartheid regime that 
systematically discriminated against Black, Coloured and Indian people. It was the national language under the 
racist Apartheid regime until 1994, and millions of South Africans, regardless of their actual mother tongue, were 
forced to learn Afrikaans. 
The June 16, 1976 Soweto Uprising, which saw Apartheid police violently suppress and kill protesting Black 
schoolchildren, became a symbol of the anti-Apartheid struggle. It was ignited when Afrikaans was forced on Black 
South African schools as medium of instruction.  
The notion that once again South Africans would be tested in Afrikaans whether they liked it or not is deeply painful 
for many. And isn't, as O'Leary would have us believe, simply a case of "doesn't make any sense." 
Imagine, a few years from now, Ryanair forcing Ukrainians to take a test in Russian to prove they had real 
Ukrainian passports. After all, Russian is widely spoken in Ukraine, and aren't Russian and Ukrainian kind of similar 
anyway? 
Opinion: Ryanair 's insensitive Afrikaans flyby
Of South Africa's 11 official languages, only English and Afrikaans have intrinsically European roots, and today, 
Afrikaans plays a complex role in South Africa. 
After generations from all walks of life were taught to speak Afrikaans, feelings towards the language are 
complicated. Simply ridding Afrikaans from everyday life will not occur anytime soon. Many speak Afrikaans out of 
necessity, and the language's reputation has evolved. Still, I know many South Africans who were forced to learn 
Afrikaans, then actively unlearned the language because they did not want to associate themselves with the brutal 
memories and trauma the language held. 
'Absurd'  
Aside from the historical and political problems around Afrikaans, Ryanair's testing policy was clearly flawed. 
Afrikaans is South Africa's third most-spoken mother tongue after Zulu and Xhosa, with only 13% of people 
speaking it as a mother tongue (that's 87% who don't). 
By Ryanair's logic, a South African with a valid passport could therefore have been denied boarding if they failed 
the test. This is as ridiculous as making Irish people pass a test in Gaelic to prove they are really Irish.  
Afrikaans originated in South Africa as a lingua franca between Dutch colonizers, slaves and indigenous 
communities. Because Afrikaans is descended from Dutch, literally all Dutch-speaking citizens of the Netherlands 
would have passed this test if they were part-time pub quiz enthusiasts.  
Actually, if Ryanair really wanted to weed out who was — or wasn't — really South African, they might as well have 
brandished tests in isiZulu or isiXhosa instead.  
Not a flying fluke 
But why did Ryanair insist on such a callous policy for almost two weeks, when even British immigration officials 
didn't require such tests? 
Sure, UK authorities can fine airlines per fake passport holder. So perhaps this was a huge publicity stunt aimed at 
an uninformed public sympathetic to any sort of anti-immigration methods regardless of how effective they are. 
It also seems a calculated economic move. Ryanair's top brass witnessed how easy, and of little consequence, it 
was for European nations simply to sever air links to southern Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Ostensibly this was done to protect public health, regardless of how ineffective those travel bans actually proved to 
be in combatting the spread of the virus. The move devastated southern African economies.  
But what about all those fraudulent passports? 
O'Leary defiantly maintained "there's a problem with fake South African passports". It is difficult to know just how 
many fake South African passports are in circulation, and certainly, there is work to do for South Africa's Ministry of 
Home Affairs.  
Yet, Ryanair's action has called into question the integrity of all South African travelers. The Afrikaans tests smack 
of linguistic and racial discrimination. 
Worse, the tests did nothing to prove anything about nationality. Instead, Ryanair's move again showed how much 
discrimination is tolerated in the travel industry.

 A Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany, Sept. 12, 2018. Budget airline Ryanair says it's forcing 
South African travellers to the U.K. to do a test in the Afrikaans language to prove their nationality in an apparent 
effort to weed out those with phony passports. It confirmed Monday, June 6, 2022 it's administering the quiz after 
reports about it circulated on the weekend, sparking anger among travellers. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File) 
LONDON (AP) — Budget airline Ryanair says it has scrapped its controversial Afrikaans language test for South 
African travelers aimed at weeding out people with phony passports.  
The Dublin-based airline changed its policy of requiring South African travelers to the U.K. to pass the quiz after the 
furor erupted earlier this month.  
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told a press conference in Brussels Tuesday that the test was being dropped, the 
BBC reported. The airline's press office confirmed his remarks.  
'Our team issued a test in Afrikaans of 12 simple questions,' such as naming the mountain outside the capital 
Pretoria, O'Leary told reporters. 
'They have no difficulty completing that. But we didn't think it was appropriate either," he said. "So we have ended 
the Afrikaans test, because it doesn't make any sense.' 
Ryanair doesn't fly to or from South Africa but is Europe's biggest airline, carrying tens of millions of passengers 
between hundreds of cities annually.  
Afrikaans is one of South Africa's 11 official languages and is the first language of about 13% of the country's 
population of nearly 60 million. It's a Dutch-based language developed by many of the country's white settlers who 
came from the Netherlands and is associated with South Africa's apartheid regime of white minority rule that ended 
in 1994.  
Reports of the questionnaire circulating on social media sparked anger among South Africans. The airline had said 
it needed passengers to pass the test because of the 'high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports." 
South African passengers who could not pass the test were prevented from boarding and given a refund.  
7 Great Biotech Stocks to Buy in Expectations of Better Days Ahead[1] The biotechnology (biotech) sector was one 
of the best performing sectors in 2020. Many companies saw their stock prices rise as the race was on for a Covid-
19 vaccine. 
However, many of these companies were pre-revenue companies. Or they were companies that only had one or 
two in-market products or therapies. And as the calendar turned to 2021, investors took notice. And what went up 
quickly went down. And in the case of the biotech sector, it came down hard. 
Ryanair drops Afrikaans test that angered South Africans
One way to tell is to look at biotech ETFs. One of the most popular ETFs, the VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF 
(NYSEARCA:BBH) is down more than 15%. So you can imagine what it's been like for many individual biotech 
stocks. If you're a buy-and-hold investor, you're licking some wounds right about now. 
But investors who knew what companies to buy have done well. And many of those names will continue to lead the 
biotech sector in 2022. In this special presentation, we give investors seven biotech stocks that represent different 
aspects of this diverse sector. We're confident there's something for investors of all risk tolerances.

 With U.S. airlines grappling with pilot shortage, American Airlines AAL[1] has received encouraging tidings on the 
labor front, in the past week. Two regional carriers, Piedmont Airlines and Envoy Air, owned by AAL will hike the 
pay of their pilots by 50% through the August end. Latin American carrier Copa Holdings CPA[2] reported a decline 
in May traffic from the comparable period's level in 2019. 
With air fares moving north as airlines try to cover the increasing fuel expenses, European carrier Ryanair Holdings' 
RYAAY[3] CEO expects ticket prices this summer to increase in the 7- 9% range from the pre-pandemic levels. An 
expansion update was also available from JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] in the past week. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[5]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.Following the pay hike, hourly wages at 
Piedmont Airlines for first officers in their first year wil be increased to $90 an hour from $51. For first-year captains, 
pay will be raised to $146 an hour from $78. Piedmont's CEO said that the airline could even extend temporary 
hikes if needed. Piedmont's pilots are moving to American Airlines' mainline operations, leaving the carrier with a 
shortage of 25 pilots each month. Envoy Air reached a similar agreement with its pilots' union to offer a 50% 
premium to pilots' hourly rates through the end of August 2024. Envoy continues seeing about 80 of its pilots 
quitting every year to take up work in other airlines. The regional carrier has been hiring about 60 pilots a year for a 
while. On materialization, the increased remuneration will make the pilots of these two airlines the highest paid staff 
among the U.S. regional airlines[6]. 
2. Copa Holdings' traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), declined 4.2% to 1.72 billion in May 2022 
from the comparable period's level in 2019. The downside was primarily due to coronavirus-induced lower air-travel 
demand than the pre-pandemic levels (2019). Due to tepid demand, capacity — measured in available seat miles 
(ASMs) — fell 3.7% from the 2019 level to 2 billion. With traffic declining more than the amount of capacity 
contraction, load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) deteriorated 40 basis points (bps) to 85.7% in 
May. 
3. To cater to the increasing air-travel demand, JetBlue launched operations in Canada with daily nonstop flights 
from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Vancouver International Airport. With international 
travel demand recovering, the service is expected to attract substantial traffic this summer. This expansion is part of 
JetBlue's Northeast Alliance with American Airlines. JBLU is also expected to launch service to Vancouver from

Boston, MA as part of this partnership. JBLU, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is operating this new 
Vancouver service on an Airbus A320 aircraft featuring more legroom in coach, free broadband internet, and 
complimentary snacks and soft drinks[7]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
4. Per a Reuters report[9], Ryanair's CEOMichael O'Leary said that with strengthening bookings, management 
expects summer fares to increase 7-9% from the pre-pandemic levels. O'Leary said that it expects load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) to nearly reach the pre-pandemic levels of around 94% in June. "And 
July, August, and September look very strong with higher load factors and also higher fares," he added. Ryanair 
expects airport management groups to "iron out" staffing crisis through recruitment to enhance travelers' experience 
over the summer. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the 
past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks have traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has declined 13.6% to $57.01. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 26%. 
What's Next in the Airline Space? With air-travel demand increasing, more expansion-related updates from carriers 
may be available in the coming days.

While RYAAY seems optimistic about attracting substantial traffic during the summer travel period, its Spanish 
cabin crew recently warned of strike actions[5] between late June and early July, potentially jeopardizing its summer 
travel plans. 
O'Leary, however, said that any disruption caused by industrial action is likely to be "tiny and inconsequential". 
While saying that the proposed strike has "no support", he gave a heads up that there could be a small number of 
cancellations or delays. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

British Airways warns of summer of strikes as staff back industrial action
British Airways warns of summer of strikes as staff back industrial action

British Airways (BA) said Tuesday it may be facing several strikes this summer as staff backed industrial action 
following a pay dispute.
Trade union Unite, which represents 16,000 BA employees, won a 97% vast majority in a ballot for possible 
industrial action after claiming the airline restored managers' pay to pre-Covid levels but still had not reversed the 
10% pay cut issued to standard workers.
Unite also insisted thousands of staff were dismissed and not replaced, which partly caused staff shortages in 
recent months.
Britian'ssecond-largest union said: "Two years of job and pay cuts mean that BA customers and staff are 
unfortunately paying the price through sky-high ticket prices, rock bottom service levels and non-existent morale.
"Staff are simply no longer willing to excuse, or pay the price for, poor management decisions."
Unite added that 500 check-in staff will be balloted for strikes, which may be staged in July when demand is 
anticipated to soar.
BA claimed the industrial action threat was based on a misunderstanding that was sorted out as soon as it come to 
fruition.
It said it thought there was a prior pay rise that ground handlers missed, so it made the offer to compensate them 
and then realised it was erroneous, the Telegraph reported.

"After a deeply difficult two years which saw the business lose more than £4bn, we still offered payments to our 
colleagues for this year. We remain committed to open and honest talks with our trade unions about their 
concerns," a BA spokesman said.
This came a day after unions warned of six days of strike action in late June and in July by Ryanair's Spanish cabin 
staff, which may disrupt UK flights.
British Airways, which is owned by International Consolidated Airlines, known as IAG, has already cancelled 
hundreds of flights this year due to staff shortages.

 Boeing (BA) on Tuesday reported flat aircraft deliveries for May compared with April, while its gross orders 
declined.
The US planemaker said it delivered 35 jets last month, unchanged from April, but up from 17 a year earlier, 
bringing its total deliveries so far this year to 165. According to the company, 29 of the May deliveries were for its 
cash-earning 737 Max single-aisle planes, including four each to Ryanair (RYAAY), Southwest Airlines (LUV), BOC 
Aviation and SMBC Aviation Capital.
Orders last month fell to 23 from 46 in April and 73 in May 2021 as the company scrambles to resolve supply chain 
bottlenecks that have affected 737 production and to secure approval to resume deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner.
Boeing said German carrier Lufthansa ordered seven 787-9 jets and seven 777X jets in May, while Bain Capital 
Griffin ordered five 737 Max aircraft.
For the year through May, Boeing booked 236 gross orders, and 171 after cancellations and conversions. After 
accounting adjustments, the company recorded 107 net orders year-to-date.
As of May 31, the company had 5,142 unfilled orders, while its backlog came to 4,192, according to data on its 
website.

Summer airfares may cost nearly 10 per cent more than they did pre-pandemic, Ryanair's Chief Executive has 
revealed.
The fare increase comes as the budget airline's bookings bounce back to near 2019 levels.
On Tuesday, Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said bookings at Europe's biggest budget airline are 
strengthening.
Speaking to Reuters, he said the load factor - a measure of how well an airline is filling available seats - should be 
around 94 per cent in June, almost reaching pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.
O'Leary expects summer fares to be between 7 per cent and 9 per cent higher compared to before the pandemic.
"And July, August, and September look very strong with higher load factors and also higher fares," he said.
"Fares will be up probably high single digits 7,8,9 per cent over summer 2019."
He said he expects the travelling experience for European customers to improve over summer as airport 
management groups "iron out" staffing shortages through recruitment.
Will Ryanair travellers face air chaos this summer?
A snapback in air travel has triggered long queues at some British airports, as well as Amsterdam, Dublin and 
Toronto, as airport managers struggle to fill jobs fast enough.
However, O'Leary assured customers that disruption will be minimal, dismissing threats of industrial action.
Ryanair cabin crew today voted to hold six days of strikes over June and July. Workers affiliated with two Spanish 
unions are set to walk out on 24, 25, 26 and 30 June, as well as on the first two days of July.
Staff want a deal that "guarantees decent work conditions for all personnel" at the airline, the USO and SITCPLA 
unions said in a joint statement.
O'Leary said any disruption caused by industrial action was likely to be "tiny and inconsequential".
Ryanair ticket prices soar by 9% as sales boom and planes nearly full
He said there might be a small number of cancellations or delays but that the proposed strike action has "no 
support".
O'Leary said there was no progress in talks with Boeing regarding the acquisition of new aircraft, and he reiterated 
his criticism of the plane-makers management, saying that Ryanair last spoke to Boeing "two or three months ago".
Boeing has said it sold more than 700 MAX jets last year and will not do deals at unrealistic prices.

 Air travel chaos in Britain is purely down to Brexit "shambles" by hobbling recruitment at airports, Ryanair boss 
Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday. 
The CEO of Europe's biggest airline also dismissed threats of summer strike action by what he called "Mickey 
Mouse" unions in Belgium and Spain covering some Ryanair workers. 
And he said his company has dropped a controversial pre-boarding questionnaire for South African passport 
holders requiring them to answer questions in Afrikaans -- a language commonly used by just 12 percent of South 
Africans, many of them white. 
O'Leary told AFP that "100 percent" of the woes experienced by air passengers in the UK -- including massively 
long lines and cancelled flights -- was because "Brexit has been a shambles". 
"It was delivered by a government led by Boris Johnson that is also a shambles. It was inevitable that Brexit would 
constrain the labour market, you see," he said. 
O'Leary said Britain's decision to pursue a hardline departure from the European Union that put a halt to EU 
workers filling jobs is largely why it was difficult to quickly ramp up recruitment for ground and security staff at UK 
passports. 
Airports and airlines in several countries, including in the EU and the US, have struggled to cope with surging 
numbers of travellers, many of them keen to fly after months or years of being grounded because of Covid 
restrictions. 
O'Leary said that unlike European rivals Air France and Lufthansa, low-cost Ryanair had fully bounced back from 
the pandemic and was flying 115 percent of the passenger loads recorded before the coronavirus hit. 
Rising inflation was only pushing more passengers into Ryanair seats, he argued, while acknowledging that the 
airline was raising ticket prices by around 9 percent. 
He said the company's hedging on fuel prices through to March next year was keeping it competitive.

But unions in Belgium and Spain are threatening to clip Ryanair's peak summer revenues with strikes later this 
month to demand better pay and conditions. 
O'Leary shrugged off the walk-out warnings. 
"We think there will be very few strikes, if any, and those strikes will be meaningless and won't be noticed by 
anybody," he said. 
UK Airport Chaos Due To Brexit 'Shambles': Ryanair Boss
"We operate two and half thousand flights every day. Most of those flights will continue to operate even if there is a 
strike in Spain by some Mickey Mouse union or if the Belgian cabin crew unions want to go on strike over here," he 
added in a media conference. 
O'Leary said that, in Belgium, the airline had "reached agreement with the unions representing over 90 percent of 
our pilots and cabin crew" and was continuing negotiations. 
On the controversial Afrikaans test, the Ryanair boss said the company had tried to respond to a rise in detection of 
false South African passports. 
"We suffer a fine of 2,000 euros for every passenger who arrives in Dublin from Bodrum (in Turkey) with a false 
South African passport," he said. 
He added that, while the airline had been asking South African passport holders to answer local general knowledge 
and geographical questions in Afrikaans, it got rid of the questionnaire. 
"We didn't think it was appropriate either. So we have ended the Afrikaans test, because it doesn't make any 
sense," he said, adding that "South Africa needs to fix its problems". 
South Africa's government had called the test "backward profiling". 
Afrikaans is just one of 11 official languages in South Africa, and it played a role in the oppression of black citizens 
during apartheid.

 Ryanair Holdings' (RYAAY) Portuguese cabin crew members will go on strike June 24, 25 and 26 to protest 
against working conditions, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a statement from civil aviation personnel union 
SNPVAC.
The cabin staff is calling on the company to comply with Portuguese law and is also looking to draw attention to 
"multiple attacks on workers' dignity," the union reportedly said.
The development follows the recent announcement of a six-day strike in late June and early July by Ryanair's 
Spanish cabin crew, according to the report.
Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

Ryanair Faces Strike In Spain During Summer Break
Ryanair Faces Strike In Spain During Summer Break

Jun 13, 2022( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Spanish unions called on staff at low-cost airline Ryanair on Monday to hold a six-day strike at the start of the 
summer holidays, the latest action by aviation industry workers to demand better conditions in Europe. 
The planned work stoppage could cause more travel headaches in Europe, where strikes and shortages of staff 
have hit a sector that has started to recover from the Covid pandemic. 
The call for flight crew to walk out from June 24 to July 2 aims to push Ireland's Ryanair to reach a deal that 
"guarantees decent work conditions for all personnel" at the airline, the USO and SITCPLA unions said in a joint 
statement. 
Ryanair is the only international airline not to have a collective bargaining agreement that defines workplace 
conditions for its Spanish employees, according to the trade unions. 
It finally agreed to negotiate eight months ago, but ended talks after reaching a deal, which includes minimum pay 
and flight hours previsions, with one union that does not have a majority among flight crew. 
Both the USO and SITCPLA unions believe that the agreement is insufficient and does not respect Spanish labour 
law. 
"We don't expect labour conflicts this summer," Ryanair told AFP, adding the agreement it had reached in Spain 
had brought real improvements for staff.

DENNIS  
The strike would come as summer holidays get underway in European countries and a recovery in air travel 
following the lifting of most Covid-19 travel restrictions. 
The boom in demand has caught short some airlines and airports that shed staff during the pandemic and which 
are having trouble rehiring employees, as well as facing demands for wage hikes and better working conditions. 
Staff shortages have disrupted flights in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt in recent weeks. 
Meanwhile, French easyJet pilots have warned management that the British low-cost airline faces having to cancel 
a massive number of flights this summer due to staff shortages. 
The head of the SNPL pilots union at the airline, Arnaud Wiplier, said the unions sent a letter last week after 
management did not appear to realise the extent of the risk despite having to cancel flights during three-day holiday 
weekends last month. 
Ryanair Faces Strike In Spain During Summer Break
Strikes at Paris's main airport on Thursday led to a quarter of flights being grounded, runways closed and 
passengers delayed 
Nearly 1,000 SAS pilots have threatened to go on indefinite strike from the end of June after talks broke down with 
the Scandinavian airline.

From Berlin or London to New York or Los Angeles: Budget airline startup Norse Atlantic Airways wants to do for 
transatlantic flights what Ryanair and EasyJet has done for travel across Europe.
The company plans to shake up transatlantic travel with returns as low as $316 and has announced plans to 
connected US hubs to London, Berlin and Oslo.
This week in the travel and events section from the dpa trends and features desk, we've looked at how transatlantic 
flights could become more affordable and also how Myanmar's military junta is trying to pull in tourists even as it 
carries out systematic killings of protesters.

Ryanair faces strike in Spain during summer break

 Spanish unions called on staff at low-cost airline Ryanair on Monday to hold a six-day strike at the start of the 
summer holidays, the latest action by aviation industry workers to demand better conditions in Europe. 
The planned work stoppage could cause more travel headaches in Europe, where strikes and shortages of staff 
have hit a sector that has started to recover from the Covid pandemic. 
The call for flight crew to walk out from June 24 to July 2 aims to push Ireland's Ryanair to reach a deal that 
'guarantees decent work conditions for all personnel' at the airline, the USO and SITCPLA unions said in a joint 
statement. 
Ryanair is the only international airline that does not have a collective bargaining agreement that defines workplace 
conditions for its Spanish employees, according to the trade unions. 
It finally agreed to negotiate with trade unions eight months ago, but ended talks after reaching a deal, which 
includes minimum pay and flight hours previsions, with one union that does not have a majority among flight crew. 
Both the USO and SITCPLA unions believe that the agreement is insufficient and doesn't respect Spanish labour 
law. 
The strike would come as summer holidays get underway in European countries and a recovery in air travel 
following the lifting of most Covid-19 travel restrictions. 
The boom in demand has caught short some airlines and airports that shed staff during the pandemic and which 
are having trouble rehiring employees as well as facing demands for wage hikes and better working conditions. 
Staff shortages have disrupted flights in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt in recent weeks. 
Strikes at Paris's main airport on Thursday led to a quarter of flights being grounded, runways closed and 
passengers delayed 
Nearly 1,000 SAS pilots have threatened to go on indefinite strike from the end of June after talks broke down with 
the Scandinavian airline.

 Two unions representing Ryanair (RYA.IR) workers in Spain said Monday that a six-day strike will start June 24 
after the airline ended negotiations for a collective agreement. 
The 24-hour work stoppage will end July 2 and affect 10 bases in Spain, according to the release from USO and 
SITCPLA. 
Lidia Arasanz, general secretary of the USO union section at Ryanair, said the airline forced the strike after it 
refused to engage with the unions, with talks going on without a resolution for eight months. 
Bloomberg News reported the same day that a letter it saw said Ryanair found the unions to have "unrealistic 
demands and refusal to meaningfully engage," prompting it to call off talks earlier in June.
At midday, the stock was down more than 4%.

Strike Specter Looms on Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Due to Labor Woes
Strike Specter Looms on Ryanair (RYAAY) Due to Labor Woes

Jun 13, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shares of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] have declined 25.4% year to date, underperforming its industry[2]'s 16.2% 
fall. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The stock may face further hiccups as RYAAY's cabin crew may possibly call a strike in many European nations 
during the summer season. Per a Bloomberg report[3], pay-related talks with two Spanish unions (SITCPLA and 
USO) failed. 
Following Ryanair's walkout from negotiations, the unions accused RYAAY, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 
(Strong Sell), of acting in bad faith. The unions intend to return for further negotiations. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[4] 
A representative of the SITCPLA labor group said, 'We're coordinating our actions with European counterparts.' The 
two unions apart, workers' organizations in countries like Belgium, France, Italy and Portugal are also in favor of 
taking drastic actions if Ryanair does not agree to resume a dialogue. 
As a matter of fact, if this impasse continues and the strike threat materializes, Ryanair's plans to generate 
substantial traffic and revenues during the usually busy summer season may take a hit. 
Last month, RYAAY's management had projected the load factor (percentage of seats occupied by passengers) to 
reach the pre-pandemic levels at 94-95% in June-August. RYAAY CEO Michael O'Leary had said at that time, 
"Bookings over the last number of weeks have continued to strengthen - both the numbers are strengthening and 
average fares being paid through the summer are rising." 
It will be interesting to see if the above labor problem hampers these plans. Stay tuned for further updates on this 
burning issue. Stocks to Consider Better-ranked stocks within the broaderTransportation[5]sector include the 
following: 
Golar LNG LimitedGLNG[6] currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GLNG has a decent surprise history, as its

European Shares Slide Over 1% Ahead Of U.S. Inflation Data
European Shares Slide Over 1% Ahead Of U.S. Inflation Data

 European shares extended losses to a fourth session on Friday, as market participants braced for May U.S. 
inflation data that could guide the Federal Reserve's policy decision next week. 
All sectors were trading well in negative territory, with banks weighing the most on the pan-European STOXX 600 
index, which lost 1.3%. The index was on course to end the week about 2.5% lower - its sharpest decline since 
early May. 
Concerns also mounted about demand and growth in China, the world's second-largest economy, after Shanghai 
and Beijing went back on fresh COVID-19 alerts on Thursday and imposed new lockdown restrictions. 
The U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was expected to have accelerated to 0.7% last month from 
0.3% in April. But when stripped of volatile food and energy products, it was seen cooling a nominal 0.1 percentage 
point to 0.5%. 
The data is due at 1230 GMT, and bets have grown that the Fed will increase beyond the two 50-basis point hikes it 
plans for next week and July. 
"Consensus estimates for U.S. CPI release, with risks skewed to the upside, have raised worries about the Federal 
Reserve's ability to bring inflation under control while avoiding a recession," said Mark Haefele, chief investment 
officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
Equities were hammered on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would deliver next month its first 
interest rate hike since 2011, and a potentially larger move in September. 
Investors pulled out money from European equity funds in the week to Wednesday, marking the 17th consecutive 
week of outflows, due to uncertainties related to the Russia-Ukraine war, BofA said. 
Among individual stocks, GSK rose 1.4% after the drugmaker said its vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus was 
successful in a late-stage trial involving older adults. 
Regional airlines fell as carriers and airports clamour to find more workers, minimise cancelled flights and reduce 
delays for passengers amid labour strife in Europe driving expectations of more travel headaches during the busy 
summer season. 
Ryanair, International Consolidated Airlines, Lufthansa and Wizz Air dropped between 1.2% and 3.6%. 
Credit Suisse fell another 4.5% after State Street Corp said it was not looking to buy the Swiss bank. A report of a 
deal between the two lenders had sent Credit Suisse shares surging from near 20-year lows earlier this week.

       European stocks were under pressure on Friday after the ECB delivered its hawkish guidance and parts of 
China's largest economic hub imposed new lockdown.
 The focus shifted to U.S. consumer inflation data due out later in the day that could influence the Federal 
Reserve's rate-hike roadmap for fighting inflation.
 The annual rate of consumer price growth is expected to hold at 8.3 percent in May, while the annual rate of core 
consumer price growth is expected to slow to 5.9 percent from 6.2 percent.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 fell 1.4 percent to 428.31 after losing 1.4 percent on Thursday. The German DAX lost 
1.7 percent, France's CAC 40 gave up 1.5 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was down 1.1 percent.
 Credit Suisse slumped 4.2 percent to extend losses after State Street Corp. said it's not pursuing any acquisition or 
business combination with the Swiss lender.
 Just Eat Takeaway soared 8 percent on reports that its U.S. unit Grubhub is attracting preliminary interest from 
private equity firms including Apollo Global Management.
 Airlines Ryanair, International Consolidated Airlines, Lufthansa and Wizz Air lost 2-5 percent as a labor strike in 
Europe drove expectations of more travel headaches during the busy summer season.
 Drug maker GSK edged up slightly after its vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) succeeded in an ongoing 
late-stage trial involving older adults.

We regret to inform passengers of flight delays. For the next 18 months. That is the forecast, from the boss of 
London's Heathrow airport, John Holland-Kaye, of how long it will take to recalibrate supply and demand for air 
travel. The unacceptable and avoidable chaos at British airports last week, which resulted in thousands being 
forced to abandon holiday plans, therefore has a real chance of repeating itself this summer. Both industry and the 
government share responsibility to ensure that it does not.
The prospect of many people's first foreign holiday since the start of the pandemic has meant demand for air travel 
has taken off far quicker than the industry's ability to meet it reliably, at a time when airlines are already facing 
soaring fuel costs and are under pressure to transition to cleaner flights. At the height of the pandemic, airlines, 
airports and ancillary-service providers all had to reduce costs drastically, which meant swingeing job cuts and 
sometimes regrettably cynical sharp practice. Over 25,000 people lost their jobs in UK air travel, despite a 
government furlough scheme intended to help smooth out firing and rehiring. British Airways alone cut 10,000 jobs 
and threatened to force staff who remained on to cheaper contracts.
Those cuts are now proven to be too deep. Now that passengers want to travel again, workers - and their unions - 
have the upper hand in a tight labour market. Hiring staff takes longer than in other sectors because of training and 
rigorous security checks. Shortages are particularly acute among ground crew. A baggage handler's annual starting 
salary is £15,000 for a 45-hour week: pay that could easily be matched by jobs at supermarkets or delivery 
companies with more sociable hours and no lengthy background checks. Better pay may help; a cost that will 
inevitably be passed on to passengers. But if that results in a more reliable service, it may be a price worth paying.
Airlines have made promises they are unable to deliver; Companies should trim flights now to prevent a 
summer of chaos
The problem is not uniquely British. Travellers suffered in Amsterdam and Dublin airports. A strike by air traffic 
controllers in Milan added to delays. In the US, Delta said it would cut 100 flights a day this summer in order to 
minimise disruption. But bosses at Ryanair and Jet2 have been clear that the UK suffers from an additional crunch 
to worker supply from Brexit. The ideological constraints of the government, led by Boris Johnson fighting for his 
political survival, mean it is unlikely to grant an emergency visa scheme to ground crew in the EU, as it has done for 
other understaffed key roles such as poultry workers and HGV drivers.
The government, which was warned by both industry and a parliamentary committee of looming turmoil, deserves 
criticism. Confusing restrictions on air travel only lifted in March, leaving the industry scrambling to fill vacancies. 
While it has gone some way to meet industry demands that background checks be speeded up, the government 
could have done more, sooner. In a sector with such a fragmented supply chain, ministers need to take a 
coordinating role.
But the industry was well aware of the problems it faced, and how long they might take to resolve. It therefore had 
no business selling tickets it could not honour. Flight cancellations today are a result of earlier overselling. Airlines 
need to take action now to alleviate passenger misery this summer, when planned strike action in the UK and 
Europe could make things worse. Cutting flights weeks before travel, when passengers can try to make alternative 
arrangements, is the least bad option. Cutting them after passengers arrive at the airport is inexcusable. The 
industry must not make promises it cannot keep.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) and EasyJet (EZJ.L) were forced to cancel a number of flights in Italy following a strike by air 
traffic controllers and unions on Wednesday, Reuters reported the same day.

onboard sales and tough labor conditions. EasyJet pilots and flight attendants also arranged a similar strike, leading 
the budget carrier to cancel 24 flights to and from the UK. 
Overall, the strikes led to the cancellation of 360 flights and impacted 4,000 passengers, a UIL Trasporti 
spokesperson said.

workers strike, more chaos is expected for travelers. 
Multiple budget airlines cancelled Wednesday flights from Italy after a walkout by cabin crew. 
EasyJet has cancelled 20 Gatwick flights today, including departures[1] from Bologna and Milan, Naples, Rome, 
and Venice. 
Ryanair offerscancelled14 flight between London and Milan and several between Italy and Stansted Airport. 
Both airlines stated that they would do their best to minimizedisruption, but claimed that strike action was 'outside 
(their) control.' 
Unionised air traffic controllers from multiple Italian airports will strike for 24 hours today. This will cause ITA 
Airways to cancel 81 flight cancellations. 
Afterweekschaosat European airports with passengers[2] trapped in snaking lines for up to seven hours, the 
industrial action follows. 
What is the reason for strike action by Italian airline workers? Volotea and EasyJet pilots and flight attendants will 
be fired today between 10am and 2pm CEST.

Filt (Italian Federation of Transport Workers), and Uiltrasporti, (Italian Union of Transport Workers), are the 
striking[3] employees. 
The unions jointly blamed the industrial action on poor pay conditions in a joint statement. 
The statement stated that 'Among the issues are arbitrarily reduced paychecks, non-payments of sick days and 
refusals by the company to grant summer leave, as well as the inability to provide water and meals for crew 
members.' 
British Airwayshad to cancel 8,000 flights from its March-October schedule[4]. EasyJet, however, recently cancelled 
240 flights between 27 June and 10 June.

Schiphol Airport have caused major disruption. 
Although the aviation industry launched a recruitment drive, Air Council International, Europe's trade[5] body for 
airports, has warned that delays will be inevitable at two-thirds European airports this summer. 
Italy's air traffic controllers went on strike for 24 hours.Other airports, including Milan's 3 airports were affected by 
the strike.ATCworkers took to the streets from 10:00 to 18:00. 
Other workers in the aviation industry, including pilots, embarked on a four hour strike between 10:00 and 14:00. 
Many flights cancelled According to UILT, the strikes caused significant disruption and affected[6] thousands of 
passengers.Ryanair and easyJet were among the airlines that cancelled scores of flights from and to Italy on 
Wednesday. 
Strikes among airline employees On Wednesday, workers from several major airlines joined the ATC Strike, 
including Volotea and Ryanair employees, which lasted from 10:00 to 14.00. 
Employees complained about their working conditions and wages, including 'unacceptable salary reductions' and 'a 
series unjustifiable layoffs.'

Ryanair to keep 'racist' Afrikaans test for S African passengers
Ryanair to keep 'racist' Afrikaans test for S African passengers

 Low-cost carrier Ryanair will continue requiring South African passengers to take an Afrikaans test to enter the 
United Kingdom, despite receiving criticism of 'backward profiling', the company has said in a statement[1] to the 
BBC. 
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers does not operate flights to and from South Africa. So it requires any 
South African passport holder flying to Britain from elsewhere in Europe on the carrier, to prove their nationality. 
However, its 'simple questionnaire' is in Afrikaans, one of 11 official South African languages. Afrikaans is spoken 
by only 12 percent of the country's estimated 60 million people, mainly the white minority, and was used in the 
oppression of Black citizens[2] during apartheid[3]. 
The airline cited a high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports behind the requirement to fill out the test. 
'This is why Ryanair must ensure that all passengers (especially South African citizens) travel on a valid SA 
passport/visa as required by UK Immigration,' the BBC reported the airline as saying. 
The UK High Commission in South Africa said on Twitter that the Ryanair test was not a British government 
requirement to enter the United Kingdom. 
UK accused of blocking South Africans at airports unless they pass Afrikaans test. 
MyBroadband spoke to a South African expat who said she & her 11-year-old son were denied their boarding 
passes from Ireland Airport to the UK two weeks ago. 
She got 3 out of 15 questions wrong.. pic.twitter.com/PhLSN1m3xO[4] 
— Vehicle Trackers (@VehicleTrackerz) June 3, 2022[5] 
Ryanair's spokesperson said that fliers who failed to answer the questions would be 'refused travel and issued with 
a full refund'. 
In a statement, South Africa's Department of Home Affairs said: 'We are taken aback by the decision of this airline 
because the Department regularly communicates with all airlines to update them on how to validate South African 
passports, including the look and feel.' 
Zinhle Novazi, a South African lawyer, faced the test, which included naming the highest mountain, its largest city 
and one national holiday, when travelling by Ryanair from Ibiza, Spain, to London on May 29. 
'I was able to answer the questions,' said Novazi, who learned Afrikaans in school but is not a native speaker of the 
language. She was then allowed to board the plane. 
The test triggered a backlash from South Africans in Johannesburg.

'They're using this (test) in a manner that is utterly absurd,' Conrad Steenkamp, the chief executive officer of the 
Afrikaans Language Council, said.

 Spanish unions USO and STCPLA called out Ryanair (RYA.IR) for allegedly acting in bad faith after the budget 
airline ceased salary increase negotiations despite strike threats, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing a joint 
statement from the labor organizations.
In the statement, the unions claimed that the Irish air carrier said that the strike threat demonstrated the workers' 
lack of commitment to dialogue. USO and STCPLA urged Ryanair to resume negotiations.
A same-day report by Reuters said Ryanair canceled a number of flights in Italy due to a four-hour strike by air 
traffic controllers and unions.
Earlier in May, seven unions from Italy, France, Portugal, Belgium and Spain warned that Ryanair's cabin crew in 
those European nations could commence strike action in the summer if the company fails to address their demand 
for better working conditions. 
Ryanair lost 3% on Wednesday's close.

A STRIKE called by Italian air traffic controllers led to more chaos in the UK.
Thousands of passengers yesterday were left stranded at British hubs after Ryanair, Easyjet, British Airways (BA) 
and Jet2 cancelled dozens of flights from the UK to Italy.
Easyjet axed 20 flights from Gatwick telling passengers it was doing "all possible to minimise any disruption that 
may occur as a result of the strike action," while BA was forced to cancel 14 flights between London and Milan.
A spokesperson for Ryanair said the strikes were "completely beyond our control and we sincerely apologise for 
any inconvenience they will inevitably cause".
BA also announced it cancelled 14 flights between London and Milan.
Italy was not the only destination that saw hundreds of UK flights cancelled as BA scrapped 122 flights overall, 
including several domestic ones, while Easyjet's total count amounted to 60.

Travellers face more chaos as thousands of Italian airline workers prepare to strike today.
Faced with a cabin crew walk-out, multiple budget airlines have cancelled Wednesday flights to and from Italy.
EasyJet has canned 20 Gatwick flights scheduled for today, including departures to Bologna, Milan, Naples, Rome 
and Venice.
Ryanair has cancelled 14 flights between London and Milan, and several flights between Italy and Stansted Airport.
In statements, both airlines promised to do "all they can" to minimise disruption, but insisted that strike action is 
"outside of (their) control."
Unionised air traffic controllers at multiple Italian airports will also strike for 24 hours today, leading Italian carrier 
ITA Airways to cancel 81 flights.
The industrial action comes after weeks of chaos at European airports, with travellers trapped in snaking queues for 
up to seven hours.
Why are Italian airline workers on strike?
Pilots and flight attendants of Volotea, EasyJet and Ryanair (including sister airlines Malta Air and Crewlink) will 
walk off the job between 10am to 2pm (CEST) today.
Meanwhile, air traffic controllers at multiple Italian airports will strike for an entire 24 hours, returning to work on 
June 9.
The striking staff are members of Filt (Italian Federation of Transport Workers) and Uiltrasporti (Italian Union of 
Transport Workers, or UILT).
In a joint statement, the unions blamed poor pay conditions for the Industrial action.
Flight cancellations: Easyjet , Ryanair , and ITA Airways suspend flights as Italian workers strike
"Among the issues are... arbitrary reductions of paychecks, the non-payment of sick days, the company's refusal to 
grant leave during the summer season, and the lack of water and meals for the crew," the statement read.
UILT said that if an agreement is not reached, "this will be only the first of a series of protest actions that will make 
the summer 'hot'".
Impacted airlines have advised travellers to check their flight status before arriving at the airport.
What's going on in European airports - and when will queues get better?
The strikes are the latest issue to beset European airports.
Winding queues, packed departure halls, and travellers missing flights have become a common sight across the 
continent.
The entire industry is facing severe staff shortages, after more than 191,000 European aviation workers were made 
redundant during the pandemic.
As travel demand surges, airports and airlines are ill-equipped to handle the influx.
British Airways was forced to scrap 8,000 flights in its March-October schedule, while EasyJet recently cancelled 
240 flights between 27 May and 10 June.
Airports are also feeling the heat. Security delays at Dublin Airport, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, and Manchester 
Airport have caused mammoth disruption for thousands of travellers.
The aviation industry has launched a recruitment drive, but Air Council International - Europe's trade body for 
airports - has predicted that delays are inevitable at two-thirds of European airports this summer.

 The South African government called out Ryanair (RYA.IR) for requiring its nationals to take an Afrikaans language 
test before being allowed to board flights to the UK, DW News reported Tuesday, citing a statement from South 
Africa's Department of Home Affairs.
The budget airline claimed that the test was intended to combat the "high prevalence of fraudulent South African 
passports." The South African government, however, noted that it already has an existing system designed to stop 
the use of fake documents, including a 24-hour service allowing air carriers to validate South African passports.
A spokesperson for Ryanair said passengers who fail the test will be refused travel and receive a full refund.
Ryanair fell more than 1% on Tuesday's close.

fire for asking South African travelers to take an Afrikaans test to prove their nationality before boarding flights 
(Adrian Dennis-AFP-Getty Images) *(CNN) — Ryanair has come under fire for asking South African travelers to 
take an Afrikaans test to prove their nationality before boarding flights. 
The low-cost airline is being accused of racial discrimination after presenting passengers with a test in the West 
Germanic language, which was forced upon black South Africans under apartheid and is only used by an estimated 
12% of the population. 
News of the test came to light last month after a passenger traveling from Portugal to London revealed on Twitter 
[1]that he'd been asked to complete 'a two page test in Afrikaans' before being permitted to board his flight. 
The move sparked fury among South Africans, with many taking to social media to criticize the airline, pointing out 
that South Africa has 11 official languages, and many nationals do not speak Afrikaans.

'Insane and discriminatory' 
Independent aviation analyst Alex Macheras described the decision as 'categorically insane and discriminatory.'[3] 
Ryanair has since released a statement declaring that the test, made up of questions related to South African 
general knowledge, was issued as a response to the 'high prevalence' of counterfeit South African passports. 
'In order to minimize the risk of fake passport usage, Ryanair requires passengers on a South African passport to fill 
out a simple questionnaire in the Afrikaans language,' reads the statement provided to CNN. 
'If they are unable to complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund instead. 
'Airlines operating to the UK face Home Office fines of 2,000 (around $2,515) per passenger for anyone who travel 
illegally to the UK on a fraudulent passport/visa.'

The UK High Commission in South Africa has also responded, pointing out that the questionnaire is 'not a UK 
Government requirement.'[4] 
Afrikaans is the third most spoken language in South Africa after Zulu and Xhosa. 
Ryanair does not operate direct flights to or from South Africa.

 Sean Bickings / police body cam footage *Three officers with the Tempe police department in Arizona have been 
placed on administrative leave after watching a Black man drown while pleading for help. 
The police department released body cam footage of the disturbing incident that occurred at the Elmore Pedestrian 
Bridge on May 28, TooFab[1] reports. The three officers were responding to an 'alleged fight' between Sean 
Bickings and his wife. When the officers arrived at the scene, the couple denied that a physical altercation had 
taken place. 
Officials said Bickings attempted to flee the police by getting into the water as the cops ran the couple's names 
through a database to check for outstanding warrants. The man climbed over a 4-foot metal fence and entered a 
Tempe City reservoir.

'You can't swim in the lake, man,' the cops tell him, according to a police body-camera-footage transcript that was 
released by the city, per the report. 'You're not allowed to swim in the lake.' 
Bickings ignores the cops and swims about 100 feet out into the water as the officers watch. 
'How far do you think he's gonna be able to swim?' one cop says to the other. A bike-mounted officer remarks 'I'm 
pretty sure there's turbines at the base of the dam that could suck him under the water.' 
'So what's you plan right now?' the officer on the bridge asks Bickings in the water. 
'I'm going to drown. I'm going to drown,' he replies. 
'No you're not,' one officer tells him. 
'Go at least go to the pylon and hold on,' the second officer calls down. 
'I'm drowning.' 
'Come back over to the pylon.' 
'I can't. I can't,' the man says. 
'Okay, I'm not jumping in after you,' the officer tells him. 
'Please help me. Please, please please,' Bickings begs. 'I can't touch. Oh God. Please help me. Help me.'

Sean Bickings' death comes amid criticism of police not 'doing anything' to stop a mass shooting in a school in 
Uvalde, Texas. https://t.co/3DuL61rsR7[3] pic.twitter.com/tHjpSicl1y[4] 
— NewsOne (@newsone) June 6, 2022[5] 
Bickings' last words are 'Can you hear me?' — and this is where the footage cuts off 'due to the sensitive nature of 
the remaining portion of the recording,' according to police. Bickings drowned and his body was recovered hours 
later. A local police union said the cops who refused to rescue him were simply following their training. 
The Tempe Officers Association, the city's police union, said police officers do not get training in water rescues nor 
do they have the life-saving equipment needed to help people who are drowning, NBC News[6] reports. 
'Attempting such a high-risk rescue could easily result in the death of the person in the water and the officer, who 
could be pulled down by a struggling adult,' the group said. 'Officers are trained to call the Fire Department or get 
the Tempe Police boat. That is what officers did here.' 
The union noted that its 'grief mirrors our community's grief,' adding, 'No one wanted this incident to end as it did.' 
The three officers have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into how the department 
handled the situation with Bickings.

Low-cost airline Ryanair has announced that it will require South African travelers aiming to enter the United 
Kingdom to conduct a test in the Afrikaans language to prove their nationality. The controversial decision, which 
sparked outrage among travelers and online, was made in a bid to restrict passengers with fake identity documents 
from entering the country.
According to World Data, there are around 8 million native Afrikaans speakers in South Africa. The country has 11 
official languages, and only around 13% of South Africans speaking Afrikaans as a first language.
The origin of the language dates back to the early 18th century, evolving from one of the Dutch dialects spoken by 
various Europeans, including Dutch, French and German nationalities. The language was imposed during white-
minority rule in South Africa.
"Due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports, we require passengers traveling to the U.K. to fill 
out a simple questionnaire issued in Afrikaans," Ryanair wrote in a statement issued to AeroTime on June 7, 2022. 
"If they are unable to complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund."
While Ryanair does not provide direct air connectivity services between South Africa and the UK, the carrier 
confirmed that it will administer the test to all South African passport holder who aim to board flights to the UK from 
other countries across Europe.

South Africa slams Ryanair 's Afrikaans test as "backward"
South Africa slams Ryanair's Afrikaans test as "backward"
Alliance News UK

(Alliance News) - South Africa on Tuesday said it was surprised at Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's 
"backward profiling" of passengers, who were given a pre-travel test in Afrikaans to prove they were legitimate 
passport holders.
The airline has admitted it imposed a requirement for South Africans flying to Britain and Ireland to fill out a 
questionnaire issued in Afrikaans "due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports".
Passengers who fail to complete the questionnaire are denied travel and fully refunded for their tickets.
Afrikaans, just one of 11 official languages in South Africa, is commonly used by around 12% of the country's 
population of nearly 60 million, and played a controversial role in the oppression of black citizens during apartheid. 
South Africa's Department of Home Affairs said in a statement: "We are taken aback by the decision of this airline 
because the Department regularly communicates with all airlines to update them on how to validate South African 
passports, including the look and feel." 
The department also runs a 24-hour operations centre that airlines can access to verify South African passports. 
"It is not clear to which extent the airline has used these services before resorting to this backward profiling 
system," it said.
In response to uproar on social media, Britain's ambassador in South Africa took to Twitter to clarify that such 
language and general knowledge tests were "not a UK government requirement" for South Africans entering the 
UK. 
"Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi is at the forefront of efforts to bring an end to the abuse of South African travel 
documents," the statement said.
South Africa slams Ryanair 's Afrikaans test as "backward"
It added an unspecified number of passport fraud kingpins and their lieutenants have been arrested in recent 
months.
The Pan South African Language Board, a state organisation tasked with promoting multilingualism in the country, 
was disgusted by Ryanair's method of verifying passports through an Afrikaans test.
"We find this reckless decision by Ryanair quite problematic and is reminiscent of the old colonial and apartheid 
systematic subjugation of speakers of other languages, mainly black people, to racial and linguistic discrimination," 
the board's head Lance Schultz said in a statement.

Jun 07, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - June 7, 2022 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst 
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: United Airlines UAL[1], Delta Air Lines DAL[2], 
Southwest Airlines LUV[3], American Airlines AAL[4], and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY). Here are highlights from 
Monday's Analyst Blog:Airlines Looking Good Despite Steep Fuel Costs - Here's Why: The steep oil price increase 
(up 33% in first-quarter 2022) does not bode well for the ZacksAirline[5]industry players as far as their bottom-line 
growth is concerned. This is because fuel expenses form a chunk of the input costs borne by the aviation space. 
That the oil price will be high at least in the near term can be gauged from the forecast given by the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA). Per EIA, the average Brent crude oil spot price will be $107 a barrel in second-
quarter 2022 and $103 in the second half of 2022. Akin to the first quarter, high fuel costs are likely to dent the 
airlines' bottom-line growth in the June quarter. The spike in a major input cost is likely to shoot up the airfares, thus 
making air-travel costlier. 
Despite the exorbitant air fares, stocks in the industry have gained 17% over the past three months. 
Let's delve deep to unearth the reasons for the upbeat stock price performance despite the sharp rally in the bulk 
input cost for the industry participants. 
The sole reason behind this upward stock movement is the buoyancy in demand for air-travel. That the fuel cost-
induced hike in air-ticket price is not dampening demand can be figured out from the assertion of United Airlines' 
CEO Scott Kirby. Per Kirby, there is "not a hint of evidence" that the rising ticket prices are hurting consumer 
demand. 
In response to the bullish demand scenario as highlighted by the healthy trend witnessed with respect to air-travel 
(mainly for leisure) bookings, the UAL management raised its current-quarter outlook for unit revenues. In an SEC 
filing dated May 16, UAL's management projected total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of 
unit revenue) for second-quarter 2022 to increase in the 23-25% band from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Per 
the previous TRASM forecast, given last month while releasing first-quarter 2022 results, the metric was expected 
to improve roughly 17% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights United Airlines , Delta Air Lines , Southwest Airlines , American Airlines , 
and Ryanair Holdings
United Airlines apart, other U.S. carriers, including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines 
and others lifted their respective second-quarter views for revenues. 
Delta expects June quarter's adjusted total revenues to be fully restored to the 2019 level. Previously, the airline 
had expected the same to have recovered 93-97% from the 2019 level. DAL anticipates total unit revenues to rise 
seven to eight points from its initial expectations. 
Operating margin is predicted to be 13-14% compared with the previous guidance of 12-14%. Fuel price per gallon 
is now estimated to be $3.60-$3.70 in the second quarter, higher than the previous guidance of $3.20-$3.35. 
Driven by the continued strength witnessed with respect to passenger yield, Southwest Airlines' management 
expects second-quarter 2022 operating revenues to increase in the 12-15% band from the earlier estimate of an 8-
12% rise. Economic fuel costs per gallon are now forecast in the $3.30-$3.40 range (earlier forecast was in the 
$3.05-$3.15 band). Management at LUV, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), said that the yield 
strength, driven by upbeat demand, more than offset the fuel price increase. You can seethe complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Alaska Air currently expects total revenues to increase 12-14% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Earlier 
expectation was for a 5-8% increase. Driven by upbeat demand, load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) is 
anticipated in the 87-88% range (earlier expectation was in the 85-88% band). Due to high oil price, the current-
quarter economic fuel cost per gallon forecast is raised to the $3.65-$3.68 range from the $3.25-$3.30 band 
expected earlier. However, like LUV, ALK's management is of the view that the revenue strength is offsetting 
increases in oil prices. 
American Airlines also increased its second-quarter revenue guidance owing to upbeat air-travel demand. AAL 
expects total revenues to rise between 11% and 13% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier expectation 
was an increase in the 6- 8% range). 
TRASM is now anticipated to be 20-22% higher than the second-quarter 2019 reading (earlier estimate was a 14-
16% rise). Driven by upbeat demand, the pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, is anticipated in the 4-6% 
range compared with the 3-5% band expected earlier. Due to high oil price, the current-quarter average fuel cost 
per gallon forecast is raised to the $3.92-$3.97 range from the $3.59-$3.64 band expected earlier. 
The upbeat demand scenario is aiding not only the U.S. carriers. In May, the European carrier Ryanair Holdings 
stated that load factor is expected to reach the pre-pandemic levels at 94-95% in the months of June-August. The 
rosy forecast comes on the back of healthy bookings for summer travel. 
Per CEO Michael O'Leary, "Bookings over the last number of weeks have continued to strengthen - both the 
numbers are strengthening and average fares being paid through the summer are rising." O'Leary added that 
bookings are especially strong to the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. Wrapping Up This optimistic air-
travel demand scenario, driven by wide-spread vaccination against COVID-19 and the easing of travel restrictions, 
is a huge positive for the airlines. As highlighted by the sunny top-line forecasts, passenger revenues, accounting 
for bulk of an airline's top line, are likely to be strong in the second quarter of 2022. In fact, we expect this favorable 
top-line scenario to aid the aviation space throughout the ongoing year.

 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months

 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

LONDON (AP) — Budget airline Ryanair says it's forcing South African travelers to the U.K. to do a test in the 
Afrikaans language to prove their nationality in an apparent effort to weed out those with phony passports.
Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, mainly operates routes around Europe and doesn't fly to or from 
South Africa. It confirmed Monday it's administering the quiz after reports about the test circulated over the 
weekend, sparking anger among travelers.
Afrikaans is one of South Africa's 11 official languages and is the first language of about 13% of the country's 
population. It's a Dutch-based language developed by many of the country's white settlers who came from the 
Netherlands and is associated with South Africa's apartheid regime of white minority rule that ended in 1994.
“Due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports, we require passengers traveling to the U.K. to fill 
out a simple questionnaire issued in Afrikaans," Ryanair said in a brief press statement. "If they are unable to 
complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund.”
The British High Commission in Pretoria said on Twitter that the test “is not a U.K. government requirement,” and 
linked to a website with official rules for South African visitors.

When planning the next vacation, it can be quite tempting to book the (EURO)30 Ryanair flight, instead of the 15-
hour train journey that's likely to cost heaps more.
However, flying is known to have the most harmful environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions per person - so 
it might be time to tweak our travel plans.
This week in the travel and events section from the dpa trends and features desk, we've looked at carbon 
calculators which help you to work out your trip's carbon footprint and suggest alternative modes of transport or 
routes that could help to minimize the impact of your journey.

Ryanair is making South African nationals take a general knowledge test in Afrikaans to prove their nationality 
before they are allowed to board its planes in the UK and the rest of Europe, sparking accusations of racial 
discrimination.
The airline has been telling South African passport holders, including UK residents, that they will be turned away 
unless they complete the test, despite Afrikaans being only the third mostspoken language in the country and its 
history of enforced use under apartheid.
South African travellers said they had been humiliated by the unannounced test, which Ryanair said had been 
prompted by cases of fake passports but which is not an official UK requirement.
"It's extremely exclusionary ... They didn't think about the implications" of the test in the light of South Africa's 
history, said Zinhle Novazi, a South African in the UK who does not normally speak Afrikaans but was made to take 
the test in order to board a flight from Ibiza last week. "It definitely does amount to indirect racial discrimination."
The airline's 15-question test, seen by the Financial Times, contains grammatical and spelling errors, and the 
questions include which side of the road South Africans drive on and the name of the country's highest mountain.
Dinesh Joseph, a South African resident in the UK, said he had been told at the Ryanair desk that he could not 
board a flight home from Lanzarote in May without the test, despite not speaking Afrikaans.

"It is the indignity of being told you can't have it in the language you speak," said Joseph, who has filed an official 
complaint. "You can't profile and spot check people like this."
Ryanair said: "Due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports, we require passengers travelling 
to the UK to fill out a simple questionnaire issued in Afrikaans. If they are unable to complete this questionnaire, 
they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund."
The South African Department of Home Affairs has publicised alleged cases of officials providing fake passports to 
criminal syndicates but has not linked this to travel to the UK or Europe.
There have been arrests, and investigations are continuing.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) was accused of "indirect racial discrimination" after forcing South African nationals to take a 
general knowledge test in Afrikaans to prove their nationality before boarding flights, London's Financial Times 
reported Sunday.
The airline requires South African passport holders, including UK residents, to complete the test to be able to board 
its planes in the UK and Europe, prompting one of the customers to call the requirement "extremely exclusionary." 
The company said that the test was launched in light of the "high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports," 
adding that it will refuse travel for people who are unable to complete the test and offer a full refund. 
Shares of the group were down over 2% on June 3 close.

Irish budget airline Ryanair has come under fire for language tests it requires South African passengers to take 
before flying to Britain.
Several people affected expressed outrage on social media because they were asked to take a test with several 
knowledge questions in Afrikaans, the BBC and several other media outlets reported on Monday.
Afrikaans is one of several official languages in South Africa and is only spoken by a predominantly white minority 
of the population.
Those affected complained that the practice was discriminatory and reminiscent of the oppressive system in the 
country's apartheid-era discrimination against people of non-European descent.
Ryanair, when asked by dpa, said it had introduced the test in Afrikaans after becoming aware of an increased 
incidence of forged South African passports.
"If they are unable to complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund," it added.
The test is not a requirement of British border authorities, the BBC reported.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is requiring South African passport holders to take a test in Afrikaans to 
prove their nationality, leading to accusations of racial discrimination, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
The Dublin-based budget airline is telling South African nationals they must complete a general knowledge test, 
written in Afrikaans, or they will be turned away from their flights, the newspaper said. This is despite Afrikaans 
being only the third most-spoken language in South Africa and having a history of enforced use under apartheid.
Ryanair told the FT that the questionnaire is being used "due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African 
passports".

7 Agricultural Technology Stocks to Buy as Commodity Prices Remain Volatile[1] Agriculture stocks have a place in 
every investor's portfolio. The fact is that the byproduct of agriculture literally feeds the world. But for a variety of 
reasons, supply and/or demand can be disrupted. For example, the weather is often a concern. Farmers are always 
subject to periods of drought or flooding. 
But the past few years have shown how this sector is not immune from geopolitical concerns. The Covid-19 
pandemic affected supply chains on top of seeing demand destruction in key markets. And this year, the world is 
seeing how interconnected we've become. Russia's war on Ukraine is shutting in a large percentage of the world's 
wheat supply. 
However, with commodity prices soaring in several categories, investors have an opportunity in agriculture 
technology stocks. These companies run the gamut from companies that provide equipment to those that provide 
fertilizer, pesticides, and other products and services.

 LONDON (AP) — Budget airline Ryanair says it's forcing South African travelers to the U.K. to do a test in the 
Afrikaans language to prove their nationality in an apparent effort to weed out those with phony passports.  
Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, mainly operates routes around Europe and doesn't fly to or from 
South Africa. It confirmed Monday it's administering the quiz after reports about the test circulated over the 
weekend, sparking anger among travelers.  
Afrikaans is one of South Africa's 11 official languages and is the first language of about 13% of the country's 
population. It's a Dutch-based language developed by many of the country's white settlers who came from the 
Netherlands and is associated with South Africa's apartheid regime of white minority rule that ended in 1994.  
'Due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports, we require passengers traveling to the U.K. to fill 
out a simple questionnaire issued in Afrikaans," Ryanair said in a brief press statement. "If they are unable to 
complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund.' 
The British High Commission in Pretoria said on Twitter that the test 'is not a U.K. government requirement,' and 
linked to a website with official rules for South African visitors.  
7 ESG Stocks that are Leading the Way to a Better World[1] It's becoming increasingly popular for investors to 
"vote their values." One way they do this is by investing in companies that make a demonstrable effort to improve 
the world. This is creating a category of stocks known as ESG stocks. 
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance and it covers a broad range of issues. The environmental 
component is relatively straightforward. This analyzes and measures how companies address issues such as 
carbon emissions, deforestation, and green energy initiatives including sustainability efforts built into their supply 
chain. 
The social component covers issues such as an organization's commitment to issues like the gender pay gap and 
diversity but also areas such as data security, sexual harassment policies, and fair labor practices. The governance 
component touches on areas like diversity within the corporate board of directors and executive pay. 
The focus of this presentation is to give you seven companies that are giving more than just lip service to ESG 
initiatives. One of the criteria used in selecting the stocks in this presentation was the company's Net Impact Ratio. 
This is calculated from data produced by the Upright Project's[2] Net Impact Model. 
The Net Impact Model is a mathematical model of the economy that produces continuously updated estimates of 
the net impact of companies by means of an information integration algorithm. MarketBeat captures key insights 
and presents them under the "Sustainability" tab on the company's profile page.

Travellers trying to get away over the jubilee bank holiday weekend have been advised to arrive no more than three 
hours before their flights as snaking queues add to the chaos at shortstaffed airports.
Tui and Ryanair are among airlines and holiday companies advising customers to arrive at airports three hours 
before their flights to allow time to check in, rather than the usual two-hour slot.
But customers arriving six or seven hours before flights were causing more problems, one travel industry executive 
said.
"The ecosystem works when people come when they are intended to come and join the queue."
Tui said that since the disruption earlier in the week - a result of a lack of airport staff to service flights amid soaring 
demand - schedules had stabilised and it expected to send 27,000 people on holiday today with no further 
cancellations except six flights out of Manchester airport.
The Anglo-German holiday company said on Tuesday that it planned to cancel six flights a day from Manchester 
until the end of June, as that was where problems with staffing had been most acute.
Between yesterday and Sunday, 10,794 flights are expected to depart from the UK, according to aviation tracker 
Cirium, with capacity for some 1.9mn passengers. Between May 30 and yesterday morning, 207 flights had been 
cancelled, with Gatwick airport the most badly affected.
Travellers asked to avoid arriving too early at busy airports Aviation
The issues had been widespread across Europe, industry executives said, with long delays reported at airports 
including Brussels, Schiphol in Amsterdam and Bratislava.
Paul Charles, an adviser to the travel industry, estimated that the sector was missing about a third of its pre-
pandemic workforce and efforts to recruit had been hampered by delays to security clearances and companies no 
longer being profitable enough to offer competitive wages.
"It is an issue that has to be solved in the next six weeks before the next peak in mid-July, which will be even busier 
than now," he said.
During the pandemic, airlines and airports laid off thousands of staff as travel came to a standstill, and they have 
struggled to recruit workers in line with volatile demand.
Simon Cooper, chief executive of online travel company On The Beach, said difficulties at airports meant "the whole 
industry is suffering", with contact centre staff having to deal with high call volumes from worried customers.
"It's very difficult to put someone on an alternative flight with 24 hours' notice so [customers have to rebook]," he 
said.
On The Beach had been forced to cancel holidays but only into the "hundreds", Cooper said, as it was not reliant on 
Tui and easyJet, which have experienced the most cancellations.
Stansted, the UK's third busiest airport, said it was operating normally yesterday, processing more than 12,000 
passengers by 7am against its daily forecast for 45,000 passengers departing and 40,000 arriving.
"We advise passengers to arrive as advised by their airlines and not to turn up any earlier than required," it said.

Jun 03, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 With air-travel demand increasing by the day as reflected in the northbound trend in bookings, Delta Air Lines 
DAL[1] and Hawaiian Holdings HA[2] provided an improved view for their respective second-quarter 2022 revenues. 
Meanwhile, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] turned down Dublin Airport Authority's (DAA) application 
for an 88% increase in airport charges at Dublin, terming it 'unjustified and unwarranted' in the current scenario. 
Frontier Group Holdings ULCC[4], the parent company of Frontier Airlines, decided to sweeten its pot regarding its 
buyout offer to Spirit Airlines SAVE[5]. The move to introduce a clause pertaining to a reverse termination fee 
comes ahead of the SAVE shareholders' vote on the Frontier deal, scheduled to be held on Jun 10. Recap of the 
Latest Top Stories 1.On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, Delta, currently sporting a 
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), expects June quarter's adjusted total revenues to be fully restored to the 2019 level. 
Previously, the airline had expected the same to have recovered 93-97% from the 2019 level. DAL anticipates total 
unit revenues to increase seven to eight points from its initial expectations. However, the carrier now expects 
second-quarter 2022 capacity to be 82-83% of the second-quarter 2019 actuals. The earlier expectation was 84%. 
The operating margin is predicted to be 13-14% compared with the previous guidance of 12-14%. The guided range 
is less than the 2019 level by three to four points due to lower capacity and higher fuel prices. Fuel price per gallon 
is now estimated[6] to be $3.60-$3.70 in the second quarter of 2022, higher than the previous guidance of $3.20-
$3.35. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7]. 
2. Hawaiian Holdings now expects total revenues to decline 4.5-7.5% from the second-quarter 2019 level compared 
with the previous estimation of a decrease of around 8-12%. The improved guidance is due to an uptick in domestic 
yields. HA now anticipates second-quarter 2022 capacity to decline 11.5-13.5% from the comparable period's level 
in 2019. The previous view was a decrease of about 11.5-14.5%. With rising oil prices, HA now estimates[8] fuel 
price per gallon to be $3.76 compared with the previous view of $3.59. 
3. Per Ryanair's Eddie Wilson, "At a time when Irish air travel and tourism are struggling to recover from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, this application by the DAA for an 88% price increase is unjustified and unwarranted'. Per 
RYAAY's management, Dublin Airport traffic is recovering only due to the government-funded Traffic Recovery 
Airline Stock Roundup: DAL , HA's Upbeat Q2 Revenue View, SAVE , RYAAY in Focus
Scheme, which lowers charges at Dublin Airport until March 2023-end. Hence, the 88% price increase from 2023 
onward would be an exploitation of this Government Traffic Recovery Scheme.[9] 
Meanwhile, on the back of improved air-travel demand, RYAAY carried 15.4 million passengers in May 2022, up 
756% year over. The actual figure is in line with the expectation mentioned in the previous week's write-up[10], 
which had indicated that May traffic will exceed 15 million. Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) climbed to 
92% in the month from 79% a year ago. 
4. In a move that provides regulatory protection to the shareholders of SAVE, ULCC agreed to pay a $250-million 
reverse breakup fee to Spirit. Such a payment will be made only if the regulators turn down ULCC's proposed 
takeover of SAVE on the grounds of antitrust concerns. We believe that the introduction of the new clause to their 
previously announced merger agreement dated Feb 5, 2022, is a prudent move and may find favor with Spirit 
Airlines' shareholders as they vote on the deal next week. Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that almost all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 3.7% to $70.44. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index plummeted 
14.6%.

The panini has become the modern day 'chicken or fish' dilemma, but technology now offers a solution

Airline catering is much more complex than it looks and can be a logistical nightmare for airlines. Even making sure 
passengers have their preferred choice of food or beverage can be a tricky conundrum. In the past loading an 
aircraft with the right proportion of chicken or fish meals had been more luck than judgement although a lot of 
manual calculations behind-the-scenes established an average formula.
However, average is no longer enough with the LCCs and changing practices bringing a much wider variety of 
products now available onboard to purchase. Fortunately, technology is working to ensure the right inventory of 
products are loaded on aircraft to meet passenger wishes.
Irish budget carrier Ryanair is currently the world's largest international airline, operates one of the world's most-
visited travel websites, and - as reported by The Economist - its finance director reckons it is the "largest seller of 
ham and cheese panini in Europe".
The airline is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer, using the cloud across its operations to lower costs, 
reduce food waste, cut carbon emissions, and ultimately, deliver the best possible experience for its passengers.
"Your holiday starts on the aircraft," said Aoife Greene, Ryanair's deputy director ancillary and head of retail, who 
decides exactly what food, beverages, and other items, and in what quantities, each jet should load every morning. 
"People want their gin and tonic. They want their ham and cheese panini. They want to sit back and relax. They 
don't want to hear, 'no, that's not available.' It's our job to make sure no one is disappointed."
What few Ryanair passengers realise as they bite into their sandwiches is that the trollies rolling down the aisle are 
serving more than snacks. The trollies are a vital source of information about what's being requested and sold, 
which is fed into a machine learning tool (nicknamed the "panini predictor") built using AWS that's helping the airline 
forecast precisely which products to put on which plane. But why?

 Labor union Unite on Wednesday cautioned that Ryanair (RYA.IR) flights from UK's Stansted airport are at risk of 
"serious disruption" during the summer due to an ongoing pay dispute.
Employers at Blue Handling, which provides baggage handling, check-in and other services to Ryanair at the British 
airport, dismissed a 4% pay hike offer, noting that they were hit by a 10% pay cut at the peak of the COVID-19 
pandemic in 2020. 
Workers at the ground handler warned that they could initiate a strike in the summer or launch an industrial action 
ballot if Blue Handling does not put forward a better salary deal in the coming days.
Ryanair fell over 2% on Wednesday's close.

Belavia suspends Tel Aviv route due to lack of handling

Belavia (B2, Minsk National) will not launch its summer route from Minsk National to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion after 
groundhandling companies at the Israeli gateway refused to serve the sanctioned carrier.
"Based on the permission issued [on May 15], the airline began selling tickets for new flights, the first of which was 
scheduled for June 2. The Israeli's sudden decision to cancel the previous agreements is surprising," Chief 
Executive Igor Cherginets said.
Although Belavia hinted that the decision was caused by the withdrawal of the permit by the authorities, sources 
clarified to the Israel Hayom daily that no such ban was issued. Instead, ground handling companies at Tel Aviv 
airport are unwilling to risk US secondary sanctions for dealing with the state-owned Belarussian carrier.
Belavia has not been flying to Tel Aviv since February 17, 2022, due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. As 
the war led to the closure of airspace not only in Ukraine but also in western Russia, the airline planned to fly south 
albeit with a technical stop at Baku airport in Azerbaijan. The flights would have taken around 9 hours, as opposed 
to around 3 hours when flown directly. Belavia planned to serve Israel 2x weekly with an E195.
Prior to the invasion, Belavia was already flying a circuitous route as it had to bypass Ukraine and the European 
Union. The carrier has been banned from both territories in the wake of the May 2021 state-organised forced 
landing of a Ryanair's B737-800 at Minsk. The detour extended the flight time to Tel Aviv to over 4 hours - more 
than in early 2021 but still less than half of the planned flight time via Baku.
Belavia would only be able to use its E195s on the Tel Aviv route as its two B737-300s and five B737-800s are 
currently designated by the United States for the violation of export sanctions.

Seven of the largest European airlines are failing to take credible action on their climate ambitions, environmental 
organization Greenpeace said in a press release on Wednesday.
"Europe's biggest airlines are putting up a smokescreen of false solutions to distract from their staggering 
emissions, and keep transport in the EU hooked on oil," said Herwig Schuster, a spokesperson for the organization.
A report commissioned by Greenpeace looked at seven airlines including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, the 
International Airlines Group IAG (which includes British Airways), Easyjet, and Ryanair.
Greenpeace accused the airlines of hiding their emissions behind false promises and "greenwashing," while not 
doing enough to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
In order to keep global warming from lifting the world's temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius, Greenpeace has said 
that European airlines will have to reduce their air traffic by at least 2% annually between now and 2040.
However, "none of the companies analysed has annual reduction goals for its greenhouse gas emissions, 
committed to reduce flights, or pledged to fully decarbonise by 2040," the press release stated.
A spokesperson for Lufthansa said that the airline will look carefully at the Greenpeace study, and that the airline 
has plans to halve net CO2 emissions by 2030 from their 2019 levels.
Easyjet also responded, saying that it is aware of its responsibility and is working on becoming more climate 
friendly.
Ryanair said that the data and conclusions of the report are outdated, and that it has an ambitious climate strategy.

Greenpeace : European airlines not doing enough to protect climate
Greenpeace argued that almost all airlines are aiming to use alternative aircraft fuel, produced from biofuels, in 
order to lower their emissions.
However, Greenpeace pointed out that these fuels also contain ingredients associated with environmental 
destruction, deforestation, human rights abuses, and food shortages.
Greenpeace argued that, instead of focusing on ineffective technological solutions, the airlines would have to 
reduce the number of flights.

Bocomm Leasing and Misnheng Financial Leasing have joined a group of lessors seeking to offload some 
narrowbody exposure to different credits.
Chinese-bank backed Bocomm Leasing is in the market with a teaser document related to 14 narrowbody aircraft 
with leases attached to six airlines, sources tell Airfinance Journal.
Flydubai is the largest exposure in the portfolio with three Boeing 737-800s, one 737 Max 8 and one Max 9, which 
were acquired under purchase and leaseback deals.
Another three 737-800s, 2015-vintage aircraft, are also offered with leases attached to Hainan Airlines, along with a 
2011-vintage 737-800 leased to KLM Dutch Airlines.
The Airbus part of the portfolio includes two mid-life Airbus A321s leased to EVA Air, one 12-year-old A320 leased 
to Vueling Airlines and a pair of 2018-vintage A321s on lease to Wizz Air.
Minsheng Financial Leasing is also in the market with a portfolio including assets leased to Indigo, Go First, 
Smartlynx Airlines, Iberia, Norwegian and Sun Express.
The portfolio includes a pair of A319s leased to Iberia. Both 2008-vintage deliveries are powered by CFM56-5B5/3 
engines.
Minsheng Financial Leasing is also looking to sell two ex-Ryanair 2011-vintage 737-800s that are now operated by 
Sun Express.
The portfolio also includes a 2013-vintage ex-Norwegian 737-800 leased to Ruili Airlines. That aircraft is owned by 
a Dongjiang free trade zone-registered entity.
Another 2011-vintage aircraft is leased to Norwegian.
Two A320neos that are part of the portfolio are leased to Indian carriers Indigo and First Go. Both are 2019/20-
vintage units powered by PW1127G-JM engines.
Both entities are the latest lessor to approach the market for assets with leases attached.
Chinese lessors to sell assets
Aercap is soliciting proposals to purchase aircraft subject to applicable leases. The Ireland-based operating lessor 
is seeking to offload some current generation aircraft through the sale of aircraft with leases attached to customers.
Aercap is bringing two aircraft portfolios to market. Sources say a total of 18 aircraft are for sale including nine 
Airbus A320s, seven Boeing 737-800s and a pair of A330s.
The intention is to close the sales during the second and third quarters of 2022.
Asset servicer FPG Amentum is advertising five narrowbodies through a tender, including two new technology 
aircraft with a mix of lease-end dates.
Earlier this year Asian lessors CALC and ICBC Leasing moved to market a higher percentage of new technology 
aircraft.
The CALC 14-aircraft portfolio was almost all new technology (A320neos/A321neos) with the exception of a single 
A320 and an A330.
The ICBC Leasing portfolio included almost half new technology aircraft with the A321neo, 737 Max 8 models as 
well as 787s and A350s. Airfinance Journal understands that the fleet mix has been amended.
Minsheng Financial Leasing was unavailable for comment.

Travel disarray to last into summer; Airlines Industry blames staff shortages

Airlines fear disruption at UK airports will continue into the summer as the travel industry struggles to deal with 
growing passenger numbers and flight delays and cancellations accumulate.
Airlines for Europe, Europe's largest airline association, expects the problems plaguing the industry in the UK and 
Europe to persist "for a good chunk of the summer season", according to a briefing document seen by the Financial 
Times.
The group, whose members include easyJet, British Airways owner IAG and Ryanair, blamed a combination of staff 
shortages, higher than normal sickness rates and long waits for new staff to pass background checks.
The warning came as ministers criticised the travel industry for staffing shortages that have caused weeks of 
disruption, with the pressure set to intensify during the busiest week for flying since the start of the pandemic, as the 
school half-term break coincides with a two-day bank holiday to commemorate the Queen's platinum jubilee.
Lord Stephen Parkinson, arts minister, said yesterday that the government had "for many months" been urging the 
aviation industry to make sure it had enough staff to allow passengers to travel smoothly this summer as most 
coronavirus-related travel restrictions had been lifted across the UK and continental Europe. "We have been saying 
to the industry for quite some time they should have been prepared for this," he told Sky News.
Travel disarray to last into summer Airlines Industry blames staff shortages but government says it had time to 
prepare
"It is causing a lot of distress for people, particularly at half term, people with families and children with them. It is 
very distressing if you turn up at the airport and your flight isn't ready."
Airlines, airports and ground handlers fired tens of thousands of staff as the pandemic hit their businesses, and 
have faced mounting criticism for not rehiring people quickly enough this year. Hundreds of flights have been 
cancelled in the past week.
But some aviation executives in the UK argued that they had to deal with two years of changing travel restrictions 
with less financial support than some of their European competitors.
Airlines UK, an industry body, said the sector only had "a matter of weeks" to prepare for this summer after travel 
restrictions were lifted in March, and that the "vast majority" of flights would operate as scheduled.
The Airport Operators Association said companies had been recruiting for months, "but until the restrictions were 
lifted, uncertainty about the future of travel made this difficult".
Tui, the Anglo-German holiday company, yesterday said it had taken the "incredibly difficult decision" to cancel 43 
flights a week from Manchester airport in June. The airport blamed staff shortages at Tui and ground handler 
Swissport.
Passengers flying on easyJet complained of shambolic scenes at Gatwick airport over the weekend, including 
cancellations and delays. The low-cost airline has cancelled 24 flights a day between May 28 and June 6 to try to 
avoid last-minute cancellations.
Nearly 19,000 flights are scheduled to depart from UK airports this week, the most since the start of the pandemic 
in spring 2020, according to data provider Cirium.
"Things could get worse this summer before they get better," said Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of 
Prospect union, which represents staff in the aviation industry, including air traffic control.
John Strickland, an aviation consultant, forecast a "long summer of discontent" and said the only solution was for 
airlines to cancel flights well in advance to inject more reliability into their operations.

May 31, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has rejected Dublin Airport Authority's ('DAA') application for an 88% price increase in 
airport charges, citing that the DAA mismanaged COVID-19 recovery, which caused thousands of passengers to be 
stranded in long security queues that wound outside the terminal building. The company feels that Irish air traffic 
and tourism's recovery from the pandemic is possible only through lower airport charges and airfares. Thus, there 
'is no justification for an 88% increase in DAA's already high airport charges'. 
Ryanair further added that Dublin Airport traffic is recovering only due to the government-funded Traffic Recovery 
Scheme, which lowers charges at Dublin Airport until March 2023-end. Hence, the 88% price increase from 2023 
onward would be an exploitation of this Government Traffic Recovery Scheme, feels RYAAY management. 
The DAA is seeking to hike prices because of its higher capital spending on "tunnelling" under existing runways. 
Ryanair CEO, Eddie Wilson, said that instead of 'unnecessary gold-plated facilities', the DAA should focus on 'fixing 
recruitment to deliver an efficient customer service through security'. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price

Holdings PLC price[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] 
Wilson called on the minister for finance, Paschal Donohoe, to issue a shareholder direction to the DAA to abandon 
any application for cost increases at Dublin Airport so that the Irish aviation, Irish tourism and the DAA can be 
protected from a traffic collapse. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation[4] sector are as follows: 
Golar LNG Limited GLNG[5] flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a stellar earnings surprise 
history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed 
once, the average surprise being 42.1%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Shares of Golar LNG have rallied more than 100% in a year. 
Star Bulk Carriers SBLK[7] carries a Zacks Rank #1. The company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 7.1%. 
Shares of Star Bulk have gained more than 96% in a year. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Rejects DAA's Proposal for 88% Price Increase
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) this summer will operate 15 routes to/from Pescara this summer, making it its largest-ever 
operation from the Italian Adriatic coast city.
The Irish budget carrier, in a statement, announced it would station one aircraft at Pescara in summer 2022 to 
operate 100 weekly flights, 20 more than before the pandemic.
This would include two new routes to Manchester Int'l in northern England, and Memmingen in Germany.
Pointing out that it supported the post-pandemic recovery in Italy, the airline again requested the Italian government 
to eliminate Italy's "tourism tax" (municipal surcharge) on all air travel from 2022 to 2025. "The tax is affecting the 
competitiveness of Italian airports compared to other European ones," commented Ryanair's Country Manager 
Italy, Mauro Bolla.
Abruzzo Region President Marco Marsilio, said Pescara's Abruzzo Airport was heavily impacted by the pandemic. It 
had recorded a 72.9% decrease in passengers at the end of September 2020. Still, the region continued to invest in 
the airport, including a runway extension which opened the opportunity for intercontinental flights.
Vittorio Catone, President of Saga, the company that manages Abruzzo Airport, said the company noticed signs of 
recovery. In April 2022, the airport handled 66,823 passengers, exceeding the 66,370 recorded in April 2019. "The 
desire to return to travel and live normally is clear and palpable," he said.

to eliminate Italy's "tourism tax" (municipal surcharge) on all air travel from 2022 to 2025. "The tax is affecting the 
competitiveness of Italian airports compared to other European ones," commented Ryanair's Country Manager 
Italy, Mauro Bolla.
Abruzzo Region President Marco Marsilio, said Pescara's Abruzzo Airport was heavily impacted by the pandemic. It 
had recorded a 72.9% decrease in passengers at the end of September 2020. Still, the region continued to invest in 
the airport, including a runway extension which opened the opportunity for intercontinental flights.
Vittorio Catone, President of Saga, the company that manages Abruzzo Airport, said the company noticed signs of 
recovery. In April 2022, the airport handled 66,823 passengers, exceeding the 66,370 recorded in April 2019. "The 
desire to return to travel and live normally is clear and palpable," he said.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) on Monday turned down an application from Dublin Airport operator DAA seeking an 88% 
increase in its airport charges in Dublin, Ireland, starting 2023. 
According to the Irish budget airline, the price increase is "unjustified" as the DAA is exploiting the government-
backed traffic recovery scheme, which aims to recover air traffic and tourism in Ireland after restrictions stemming 
from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Meanwhile, it added that the price increase reflects an extravagant capital expenditure plan for "tunneling" under 
existing runways at Dublin Airport, which will damage the competitiveness of Irish tourism in the long term. 
Shares in Ryanair were up nearly 1% on Monday morning.

May 27, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 With air-travel demand increasing by the day as reflected in the northbound trend in bookings, Southwest Airlines 
LUV[1] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] raised their respective forecasts for second-quarter 2022 revenues. Also 
driven by strong bookings, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] anticipates load factor (percentage of 
seats occupied by passengers) to reach pre-pandemic levels at 94-95% in June-August. Ryanair was also recently 
in the news when it reported narrower-than-expected loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. That story 
was reported in details in the previous week's write-up.[4] 
Alaska Air Group ALK[5] also grabbed the headlines, thanks to its labor problems that saw its pilots voting to 
authorize a strike in case the ongoing negotiations with the management on a new contract (the deadlock persists 
for more than three years) ultimately fizzle out. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines DAL[6] decided to trim its summer 
schedule to dodge travel disruptions during the busy season. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 On the back of 
upbeat air-travel demand, Ryanair expects traffic for the month of May to exceed 15 million passengers. The 
reading in April was14.24 million. Load factor is expected to be 92% in May, indicating growth from 91% in April. 
Per CEO, Michael O'Leary, "Bookings over the last number of weeks have continued to strengthen - both the 
numbers are strengthening and average fares being paid through the summer are rising." O'Leary added that 
bookings are especially strong for travel to the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece[7]. 
2.. Highlighting the labor trouble, which has been hurting the U.S. Airline industry of late, Alaska Air's pilots voted 
overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if an agreement on a new employment contract fails to materialize. This 
development was confirmed by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). ALPA represents the 3,000 plus pilots at 
Alaska Air, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 96% of pilots participated in the voting procedure with 99% 
supporting the call of a strike by union leaders if the talks with the airline, which have been prolonged for more than 
three years, eventually falls through. However, the vote to authorize a strike does not imply that passengers of 
Alaska Air will be inconvenienced. The pilots can halt work and go on a strike only if the National Mediation Board 
allows them to take this drastic step. So, ALK's operations are currently in no way impacted[8] 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9]. 
3. Driven by the continued strength witnessed with respect to passenger yield, Southwest Airlines' management 
expects second-quarter 2022 operating revenues to increase in the 12-15% band from the earlier estimate of an 8-
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV , JBLU 's Rosy Q2 Revenue Views, ALK 's Labor Woes & More
12% increase. The same is compared with the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Capacity is still expected to decline 
around 7% in the current quarter from the second-quarter 2019 level. Economic fuel costs per gallon are now 
forecast in the $3.30-$3.40 range (earlier forecast was in the $3.05-$3.15 band). Management said that the yield 
strength, driven by upbeat demand, more than offset the fuel price increase. LUV still expects cost per available 
seat miles or CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 14-18% in the 
ongoing quarter from the comparable period's level in 2019. 
4. Driven by a strong demand environment, JetBlue Airways' management expects revenues for second-quarter 
2022 to be 'at or above high-end' of the earlier expectation of an 11-16% increase. The metric is also compared 
with the second-quarter 2019 actuals. On the back of a healthy completion factor so far this quarter, capacity is now 
expected to increase in the 2-3% band (earlier expectation for the second-quarter 2022 capacity was either flat or 
an increase up to 3% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals). JBLU still expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and 
profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 15-17% in the ongoing quarter from the comparable period's 
level in 2019. Fuel price per gallon is now expected to be $4.08 compared with the earlier estimate of $3.79. 
5. To improve operational reliability as air-travel demand bounces back from the pandemic lows, Delta's 
management confirmed that in the Jul 1-Aug 7 time frame, it will reduce services by roughly 100 daily departures. 
The cuts will be primarily in the US and Latin America markets. Highlighting the buoyant air-travel demand scenario, 
DAL anticipates to carry 2.5 million customers this Memorial Day weekend. The projection, if comes true, would 
mean a 25% increase from the year-ago reported figure. Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that the airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, driven by the optimistic 
revenue forecasts for the June quarter as air-travel demand soars. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 3.8% 
to $70.98. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 11%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? With Delta scheduled to be present at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Jun 1, all eyes will 
be on whether DAL ups its second-quarter 2022 revenue forecast like LUV and JBLU.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) workers in Italy plan to launch a four-hour strike on June 8 to protest a pay cut and the tough 
work conditions at the European budget airline, unions FILT-CGIL and UIL Trasporti said Thursday.
The unions called for the labor strike due to the "impossibility of a discussion" over the problems that have affected 
the crew for months, including unpaid sick days and Ryanair's refusal to approve compulsory leaves during the 
summer, among others.
Previously, Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary claimed that it was "too early" to negotiate wage hikes as the 
pandemic's impact on air travel still persists.
Ryanair rose around 2% on Thursday's close.

stated. 
RYAAY CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters, "Bookings over the last number of weeks have continued to strengthen 
- both the numbers are strengthening and average fares being paid through the summer are rising." O'Leary added

May 24, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is currently mired in multiple headwinds, which we believe, have made it an 
unimpressive investment option. 
Let's delve deeper. 
An Underperformer: The Ryanair stock has declined 15.1% year to date compared with itsindustry[2]'s 9.3% fall in 
the same time frame. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Weak Zacks Rank and Style Score: Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Moreover, RYAAY's 
current Momentum Style Score [3]of F shows its short-term unattractiveness. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[4] 
Southward Earnings Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has been 
revised 41.9% downward over the past 60 days. For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has moved 
12.9% south in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers' lack of confidence in the 
stock. 
Bearish Industry Rank:Theindustryto which Ryanair belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 154 (of 250 
plus groups). Such an unfavorable rank places RYAAY in the bottom 39% of the Zacks industries. Studies show 
that 50% of a stock price movement is directly related to the performance of the industry group it belongs to. 
A mediocre stock within a strong group is likely to outclass a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, reckoning 
the industry's performance becomes imperative. 
Other Headwinds: Ryanair is being hit by lower average fares (down 27% year over year in fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 
31, 2022) due to coronavirus concerns and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is limiting top-line growth. RYAAY 
expects fares to continue to be suppressed over the near term. 
Additionally, escalating fuel prices (up more than 200% year over year in fiscal 2022) pose a threat to Ryanair's 
bottom line. Total operating expenses rose more than 100% year over year in fiscal 2022, with a substantial 
increase in airport and handling charges, among other costs. Airline Stocks to Consider Investors interested in the 
ZacksAirline industry may consider stocks like Delta Air Lines DAL[5], Southwest Airlines LUV[6] and Alaska Air 
Group ALK[7]. 
Here's Why Investors Should Give Ryanair ( RYAAY ) a Miss Now
Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding Delta. Anticipating travel-demand to 
increase further, DAL provided a bullish outlook for the second quarter. DAL expects revenue recovery to 
accelerate to 93-97% in the second quarter, with unit revenues likely to rise in double digits from the second-quarter 
2019 tally. 
Delta expects to generate a strong free cash flow in the June quarter. DAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The 
positivity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being 
revised 71.6% upward over the past 60 days. DAL has a Growth Style Score[8] of B. 
Continued recovery in air-travel demand bodes well for Southwest Airlines. Anticipating a steady improvement in 
bookings, the carrier expects to reap profits in the remaining three quarters of 2022 as well as for the full year. 
LUV's management predicts operating revenues to increase 8-12% in the second quarter of 2022 from the 
comparable period's level in 2019. LUV is seeing strong bookings for spring and summer travel. 
Southwest Airlines currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The positivity surrounding the stock is evident from the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised more than 100% upward over the past 60 days. 
Like DAL, LUV too has a Growth Style Score of B. 
Like DAL and LUV, Alaska Air expects the air-travel demand scene to get brighter with the summer fast 
approaching. ALK's management predicts a double-digit percentage increase in yield, unit revenues and the pre-tax 
margin in the June quarter from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Moreover, driven by high passenger revenues, 
ALK expects to reap profits from the second quarter onward through 2022. 
Alaska Air currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The air of optimism surrounding the stock is evident from the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 38% upward over the past 60 days. ALK has a 
Growth Style Score of A. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand,

Ryanair loses legal challenge against Condor state aid
Ryanair loses legal challenge against Condor state aid

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has lost its legal challenge against a 2019 German government bailout of charter carrier 
Condor (DE, Frankfurt Int'l), as the Luxembourg-based General Court of the European Union found in a ruling that 
the aid had been legitimate.
The German federal government and the State of Hessen pledged a six-month bridging loan to Condor in 
September 2019, shortly after its parent Thomas Cook Group declared bankruptcy. The European Commission 
approved the idea the following month. Ryanair won a first challenge against the EUR550 million euro (USD670 
million) state aid at the General Court in June 2021 - only for Brussels to re-approve it in July after a brief 
investigation.
On May 18, the court "dismissed the action in its entirety" as it said Ryanair had "failed to demonstrate the 
existence of doubts as to the compatibility of the notified aid measure." This was because "the applicant did not 
succeed in rebutting the commission's findings that Condor's difficulties were the result mainly of Thomas Cook 
Group being placed into liquidation and not of an arbitrary allocation of costs within the group."
Ryanair did not succeed in demonstrating any wrongdoing in a cash-pooling system the group had used between 
its subsidiaries for years, nor did it prove that Condor's difficulties could have been dealt with by the group itself, the 
court said.
The court also rejected Ryanair's complaint alleging that the European Commission should have had doubts the aid 
met requirements that a bankruptcy would involve serious social hardship or severe market failure, pointing to, for 
example, the probability of immediate repatriation for up to 300,000 Condor passengers across 50 to 150 different 
destinations.
Finally, the General Court rejected as unfounded the applicant's complaint that the commission had carried out an 
incomplete and insufficient examination of the conditions for the rescue aid.
Ryanair and Condor did not immediately respond to ch-aviation's request for comment.
Condor operated a fleet of 54 aircraft before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the ch-aviation 
fleets advanced module, it currently operates 56, namely sixteen A320-200s (including two wet-leased from 
Ryanair loses legal challenge against Condor state aid
Bulgaria Air and one from Lithuania's Heston Airlines), ten A321-200s, three A330-200s, thirteen B757-300s, and

"When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions!" said Claudius in Hamlet - a most relevant 
thought for aerospace and defence company Boeing to nurse at a time when the company appears to be both 
homeless and clueless ("Boeing accused of heading in wrong direction with move to Virginia HQ", Report, May 18; 
and "Ryanair chief claims Boeing managers 'not up to the job'", Report, May 17).
Boeing is abandoning Chicago for a new headquarters near Washington, DC, in Arlington, Virginia at a time when 
there are a litany of problems facing the company's civil aviation division. A return to the aerospace group's spiritual 
home in Seattle might have sent a powerful message to customers and employees alike - a declaration that Boeing 
means to address its many challenges while it attempts to emerge from the 737 Max crisis and other setbacks on 
civil and military programmes that have dented customer and investor confidence.
A board is a team, not a bystander, nor a corporate body frozen by groupthink. A company that ought to celebrate 
the engineering culture which made it a great name in aerospace is now focusing its attentions on government 
relations rather addressing its myriad delivery problems and building back confidence with its customers.
It would seem that Boeing's board has subordinated common sense and chosen to be frozen by the glare of big 
government, which is likely to yield nothing more than scorn and reproach.

the engineering culture which made it a great name in aerospace is now focusing its attentions on government 
relations rather addressing its myriad delivery problems and building back confidence with its customers.
It would seem that Boeing's board has subordinated common sense and chosen to be frozen by the glare of big

homeless and clueless ("Boeing accused of heading in wrong direction with move to Virginia HQ", Report, May 18;

May 23, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - May 23, 2022 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:Spirit Airlines SAVE[1], JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[2], United Airlines UAL[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and Gol Linhas Areas Inteligentes GOL[5]. Here are 
highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Roundup: JetBlue-Spirit Saga Continues, and More In the past 
week, there were quite a few updates on the impending takeover of Spirit Airlines. On May 16, JetBlue Airways, 
after being rejected initially on May 2, refused to give up and launched a hostile all-cash unsolicited tender offer to 
acquire all the outstanding shares of SAVE's common stock. However, the latter's management stuck to its stance 
and turned down the offer put forth by the former yet again. 
United Airlines'management gave an improved revenue guidance for the June quarter as bookings continue to get 
healthier. In another encouraging update, UAL received the green signal from the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) to operate its fleet of 52 Boeing 777s again. The jets are powered with Pratt & Whitney engines. 
The planes have been grounded since February 2021 after a Honolulu-bound flight suffered an engine failure and 
made an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport. On the earnings front, Ryanair Holdingsreported 
narrower-than-expected loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022). 
Also, Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Areas Inteligentesannounced that there will be a change at its helm with a 
new CEO in place from July this year. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.In an SEC filing dated May 16, United 
Airlines' management projected total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) for 
second-quarter 2022 to increase in the 23-25% band from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Per the previous 
TRASM forecast, given last month while releasing first-quarter 2022 results, the metric was expected to increase 
roughly 17% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. 
However, due to rising oil prices, UAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), increased its average aircraft fuel 
price per gallon forecast for the June quarter. Management now expects[6]the metric to be $4.02, higher than the 
previous estimate of $3.43.

2. In a letter addressed directly to the Spirit Airlines shareholders, JetBlue on May 16 tweaked its purchase price to 
$30 per share (without interest and less any required withholding taxes). At that time, SAVE's board of directors 
advised its shareholders against taking any rash action at the moment and decided that the board will first carefully 
review JetBlue's tender offer[8]. After reviewing, SAVE's board urged its shareholders to reject the $30 per share 
cash tender offer, citing regulatory concerns. 
3. Ryanair incurred a loss (excluding 50 cents from non-recurring items) of 98 cents per share in the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. However, the amount of loss 
narrowed significantly year over year. 
Quarterly revenues of $1,319.6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,356.3 million but improved 
significantly year over year with higher traffic despite lower average fares (down 27% year over year due to 
Omicron-induced woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Ryanair expects summer 2022 average fares to be 
higher than the summer 2019 level. 
RYAAY expects fiscal 2023 traffic to be 165 million, higher than the fiscal 2022 figure as well as 149 million 
registered in fiscal 2020 (pre-pandemic). RYAAY anticipates a return to profitability in fiscal 2023[9]. 
4. Gol Linhas announced that its President and CEO Paulo Kakinoff is set to shift from his current position to 
become a member of the board of directors. Kakinoff will be succeeded by Celso Ferrer, the vice president of 
operations. This transition will be effective Jul 1, 2022. Celso joined GOL in 2003 and has served the carrier in 
various capacities ever since[10]. 
GOL was also in the news recently when it reported impressive traffic numbers for April, driven by the improving air-
travel demand scenario in Brazil. That story was covered in detail in last week's write-up[11]. Performance The 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 3.8% to $69.37. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has

 NOW HIRING: Multiple Positions Available![1] Get the latest creative news from FooBar about art, design and 
business. It was seen recently on Twitter that Magic Eden was being 'sassy' to OpenSea and mocking them on 
Twitter after the primarily Ethereum-based marketplace, OpenSea, Tweeted about Solana projects. 
Magic Eden seemingly still thinks that they're still the Solana leaders, and don't want to hand that title to OpenSea. 
In the past while, major companies' social media managers have taken a funny stance on their content strategy, 
from Ryanair to Duolingo just to name a few. Now, Magic Eden is the next on this, as they have mocked their new 
competitor OpenSea on the Twitter platform. OpenSea's original Tweet simply said: 'A Solana project thread' which 
was followed by many Solana projects that they liked. Then, Magic Eden savagely replied[2]: 'a sOlAnA pRojEcT 
tHrEaD. This is what happens when you don't DYOR' in a clearly sarcastic tone. This response Tweet has 'ratioed' 
OpenSea's original Tweet as it sits on 3,032 likes at the time of writing, with OpenSea's sitting at only 2,217. This 
sarcastic response makes it clear that Magic Eden still feels that they're the leader in the Solana space. This is 
despite the fact that OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace all in, has just stepped into the blockchain. Magic Eden 
is the established brand in the Solana space, whereas OpenSea is the established brand in the Ethereum space. 
Should they just stay in their own lane? That's the question. After OpenSea has only ever really worked within 
Ethereum (and Polygon) based NFTs, they have lately stepped into the Solana ecosystem. Solana is certainly one 
of Ethereum's biggest competitors for blockchains. Now, OpenSea is in a Solana beta stage, allowing users to buy 
and sell Solana NFTs on their marketplace in beta. The move to Solana, alongside Ethereum, makes sense for 
OpenSea. Not only does it broaden their audience, but it also allows them to have support for an eco-friendly 
blockchain. Further, it can allow its users to buy and sell certain NFTs with lower gas fees, and fast transactions. 
However, Magic Eden is still the clear leader in Solana. In the past few weeks, as Ethereum has seen a decrease, 
Solana has increased drastically in sales. Solana has always been around, with Magic Eden and Solanart being the 
leading marketplaces. However, Ethereum fans have often looked down upon the Solana blockchain, naming it a 
worse blockchain. Magic Eden is a Solana NFT marketplace and is the market leader in the space. It allows users 
to create, buy and sell NFTs on the Solana blockchain. They have a general marketplace, and also have a minting 
launchpad built into the platform. Here, certain projects, chosen by the company, can mint their NFTs if Magic Eden 
Magic Eden Gets Sassy To Opensea On Twitter About Solana NFTs - NFTevening.com
feels that they're good enough. Sadly, through this minting launchpad, some projects including Balloonsville turned 
out to be rug pulls[3]. Magic Eden was criticised massively for the things that you needed to get into it. In the case 
of Balloonsville, they apparently weren't even asked for ID. Are you tired of missing important NFT drops? Just

Short cuts: why does Malta have more planes than hotels?
Short cuts: why does Malta have more planes than hotels?

Wizz Air has announced plans to set up a subsidiary in Malta, underscoring the emergence of the tiny island nation 
(population just over 500,000) as Europe's unlikeliest new aviation powerhouse.
The fast-growing Budapest-based airline, which was founded in 2003 and now operates a fleet of 153 aircraft, 
hopes to have its Maltese business up and running by October. Chief executive József Váradi says the move is part 
of a broader plan to set up new subsidiaries and bases in Europe and beyond.
The airline's arrival in Malta is part of a much larger trend. The country, 55 miles off the south coast of Sicily, is the 
world's 10th smallest and only has seasonal tourist traffic, yet more than 500 aircraft are registered there, according 
to KMPG calculations. That leaves it with more aircraft than hotels.
Ryanair subsidiaries Malta Air and Lauda Europe were set up on the island in 2019 and 2020 respectively and 
together now operate more than 170 aircraft. Earlier this year, Lufthansa's Eurowings Europe announced plans to 
move to the country, which is already home to private jet companies such as VistaJet and Luxwing.
The weather may be good and the location helpful to link up parts of southern Europe, but the aviation industry's 
rush to Malta is based on pure economics. "Malta is seen as attractive for airlines with lower aircraft registration 
costs and a favourable tax regime," says
Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at Goodbody. According to tax advisory firm EMD, one of the most attractive 
incentives for airlines is that income from operations outside Malta is exempt from taxation in the country. Other tax 
Short cuts: why does Malta have more planes than hotels?
breaks include incentives on aircraft parts and lease payments, and there is a personal tax rate of only 15 per cent 
for people working in aviation. Meanwhile, the country is part of the EU, and flight operations come under European 
Aviation Safety Agency jurisdiction, making it straightforward to operate across the continent.
But has the influx of airlines helped if you actually want to get to Malta? Don't count on it. Many Maltese-registered 
planes will only rarely visit the island. On a typical day this week, 150 flights landed or took off from the country, 
roughly the same number as in Latvia, Lithuania or Albania, and 3 per cent of the number going to the UK or 
Germany.

Wizz Air has announced plans to set up a subsidiary in Malta, underscoring the emergence of the tiny island nation 
(population just over 500,000) as Europe's unlikeliest new aviation powerhouse.
The fast-growing Budapest-based airline, which was founded in 2003 and now operates a fleet of 153 aircraft, 
hopes to have its Maltese business up and running by October. Chief executive József Váradi says the move is part 
of a broader plan to set up new subsidiaries and bases in Europe and beyond.
The airline's arrival in Malta is part of a much larger trend. The country, 55 miles off the south coast of Sicily, is the 
world's 10th smallest and only has seasonal tourist traffic, yet more than 500 aircraft are registered there, according 
to KPMG calculations. That leaves it with more aircraft than hotels.
Ryanair subsidiaries Malta Air and Lauda Europe were set up on the island in 2019 and 2020 respectively and 
together now operate more than 170 aircraft. Earlier this year, Lufthansa's Eurowings Europe announced plans to 
move to the country, which is already home to private jet companies such as VistaJet and Luxwing.
The weather may be good and the location helpful to link up parts of southern Europe, but the aviation industry's 
rush to Malta is based on pure economics. "Malta is seen as attractive for airlines with lower aircraft registration 
costs and a favourable tax regime," says
Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at Goodbody. According to tax advisory firm EMD, one of the most attractive 
incentives for airlines is that income from operations outside Malta is exempt from taxation in the country. Other tax

Looking forward to holidays as On The Beach and airport café group SSP report results

After results from airline operators enjoyed a warm welcome in the past week, SSP Group plc (LSE:SSPG), which 
peddles food and drink in travel hubs such as airports, and online beach tour specialist On the Beach should both 
be expecting similar in the coming week if their numbers are on the sunny side. 
Ryanair and easyJet saw their shares fly 10% and 7% higher over the week, following their numbers.
Clients of Saxo Markets were so impressed they bought six times more stock in the budget airlines on the day of 
their earnings reports this week, the broker said.
SSP found itself in schtuck during the height of the pandemic but has since returned to profit.
The Caffe Ritazza and Upper Crust owner said in February that in the first four months of its fiscal year from 
October to end-January it had been trading profitably, as workers slowly return to the office, at least for part of a 
week.
Management's medium-term expectations are for a return by 2024 to like-for-like revenues and underlying earnings 
(EBITDA) margins at broadly similar levels to 2019 so investors will be focusing on how close it is to hitting that 
target.
However, analysts at Barclays are not hopeful for much, noting that the second quarter "saw a slower and bumpy 
recovery", and the reports from airlines since the end of the period have shown that travel trends have improved in 
what is the FTSE 25-listed group's second half.
Looking forward to holidays as On The Beach and airport café group SSP report results
First-half sales are expected to be at 60% the same period in the 2019 financial year, Barclays said, implying an 
underlying profit (EBITDA) of £7mln, still helped by government support.
Full-year guidance is thought "unlikely to change given rising inflationary pressures and gov't support coming off". 
Pent-up demand is probably going to be the watchword for On the Beach Group (LSE:OTB) in its interims.
In the four weeks to 23 February 2022, group sales were up 50% on 2019 levels, as travel restrictions were eased 
and business recovered from the unwelcome impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on sales in November, 
December and January.
The pandemic threat may be receding but the cost of living concerns are growing, which may be having an impact 
on big-ticket purchases, such as getaway holidays.

Airports association ACI Europe believes passenger traffic will return to pre-pandemic levels faster than expected, 
thanks to pent-up demand for travel.
The association, which represents over 500 airports in 55 countries, said on May 20, 2022 that it now expects 
passenger traffic at Europe's airports to be down 22% on 2019 levels. That compares with a previous forecast 
made in October 2021 for traffic to fall 32%.
ACI Europe said it also expects a full recovery to pre-crisis levels in 2024, rather than 2025.
"At the moment, the performance of passenger traffic is trending along our high-case optimistic scenario on the 
back travel restrictions lifting across many markets and strong summer pent-up demand," Olivier Jankovec, Director 
General of ACI Europe, commented in a statement.
The association also highlighted in a statement how recovery is being driven by leisure traffic and low-cost carriers, 
while staffing shortages are having a bigger impact on larger airports.
Eurocontrol data said on May 19, 2022 that Ryanair, Wizzair and Turkish Airlines all operated more flights over the 
last week than in 2019.
Despite the improved forecasts, ACI Europe also had a warning in light of the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, 
staffing shortages and the possible return of COVID-19 variants.
"But the history of the past three years suggests caution, especially as we still do not have an established playbook 
in Europe - let alone globally - on how to deal with future Covid-19 variants when it comes to travel," Jankovec 
cautioned.
"And beyond the immediate operational challenges from staffing issues, there is no escape from rising geopolitical 
tensions and stagflation fears meaning risks for air traffic only go one direction - down."
Airports association ACI Europe says passenger traffic will return faster than expected in 2022
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, has also warned that despite good prospects for summer 
2022, recovery is fragile, also citing risks from Ukraine, costs pressures and the potential return of COVID-19 cases 
in winter. aerotime.aero & ACI Europe

Algorithmic pricing is both efficient and absurd

D eterred by the £260 cost of a return train ticket to London, one Sunderland football fan has found a cheaper way 
to cheer on his team at Wembley this weekend: travel via Menorca. A Ryanair flight to the Spanish island, an 
overnight stay in an airport hotel, a return flight to London and a cadged car ride back home work out cheaper than 
the extortionate cost of a rail ticket.
The experience of this Black Cats' supporter encapsulates the costs, benefits and occasional absurdity of 
algorithmic pricing, now used by most train and airline companies to maximise yield. Companies can rapidly 
increase prices to exploit surging demand from football fans, for example. But they can also automatically lower 
prices to entice customers in weaker market conditions, as is the case with budget airlines.
At a time when consumers are fixated on rapidly rising inflation, price-setting mechanisms should come under 
greater scrutiny. But digital marketplaces present a challenge given so many prices are set by automated 
algorithms rather than slow-moving humans. Plus, speed and flexibility of service can often prove more important 
determinants of online purchases than price.
The promise of dynamic pricing is that it better matches supply and demand, producing greater economic 
efficiencies. But it should certainly be attracting more attention from regulators than it currently does. There is 
mounting evidence that algorithmic pricing can also lead to unfair discrimination between consumers and 
encourage implicit collusion between firms, raising prices overall.
Algorithmic pricing is both efficient and absurd
The positive case for dynamic pricing is made persuasively by Yossi Cohen, who sells such services. The Israeli 
cofounder of Quicklizard explains how his company combines historic data, prodco- uct inventories and cost 
structures with external variables, such as competitors' prices, economic indicators and the weather, to automate 
pricing decisions. "We help companies find the sweet spot on the demand curve," says Cohen.
The industry yardstick is that dynamic pricing can increase a retailer's bottom line by 7 to 10 per cent, which makes 
a critical difference in a sector notorious for thin margins. But he argues that the ubiquity of price comparison sites 
also empower consumers to get the best deals. "Online commerce has changed the equilibrium in favour of the 
consumer," Cohen says.
Intuition would suggest that an online retailer's ability to track and automatically respond to rivals' price cuts should 
increase competition. But two papers, authored by Alexander MacKay, an assistant professor at Harvard Business 
School, concluded the opposite.
In studying how dynamic pricing works in the real world, MacKay found that when a company with a sophisticated 
pricing algorithm instantly matched its rivals' price cuts, product prices rose over time. A competitor with inferior 
technology would have no incentive to lower prices. "That takes price competition off the table," says MacKay.
Even if there is no overt price collusion to excite the interest of the antitrust authorities, dynamic pricing can weaken 
competition. Savvy, time-rich consumers might be able to shop around and take advantage of timelimited offers and 
promotions, but others cannot. "The beautiful thing about competition is that when there is a lot of it consumers do 
not have to be particularly sophisticated to benefit from it," MacKay says.
In the past, regulators have stepped in to correct abuses of pricing innovations and market power. So, for example, 
retailers are banned in many countries from selling goods at below cost to drive competitors out of business.
But the challenge of regulating online marketplaces is mind-bendingly complex considering their velocity and 
opacity. Companies can also personalise offers, meaning no two customers necessarily see the same one. The 
ecommerce giant Amazon changes prices 2.5m times a day across all its product lines.
History suggests blanket price controls are a bad idea. MacKay and his coauthors offer two more innovative 
remedies. One would be to limit the frequency with which online companies can change prices. The second would 
be to bar companies from including competitors' prices in their own algorithmic models. Both measures would 
encourage more blind competition and discourage implicit collusion.
Short of such regulatory intervention, consumers will have to rely on their own wits to navigate digital markets. The 
trouble is not all of us have the ingenuity of Sunderland football fans.

Algorithmic pricing is both efficient and absurd

D eterred by the £260 cost of a return train ticket to London, one Sunderland football fan has found a cheaper way 
to cheer on his team at Wembley this weekend: travel via Menorca. A Ryanair flight to the Spanish island, an 
overnight stay in an airport hotel, a return flight to London and a cadged car ride back home work out cheaper than 
the extortionate cost of a rail ticket.
The experience of this Black Cats' supporter encapsulates the costs, benefits and occasional absurdity of 
algorithmic pricing, now used by most train and airline companies to maximise yield. Companies can rapidly 
increase prices to exploit surging demand from football fans, for example. But they can also automatically lower 
prices to entice customers in weaker market conditions, as is the case with budget airlines.
At a time when consumers are fixated on rapidly rising inflation, price-setting mechanisms should come under 
greater scrutiny. But digital marketplaces present a challenge given so many prices are set by automated 
algorithms rather than slow-moving humans. Plus, speed and flexibility of service can often prove more important 
determinants of online purchases than price.
The promise of dynamic pricing is that it better matches supply and demand, producing greater economic 
efficiencies. But it should certainly be attracting more attention from regulators than it currently does. There is 
mounting evidence that algorithmic pricing can also lead to unfair discrimination between consumers and 
encourage implicit collusion between firms, raising prices overall.
Algorithmic pricing is both efficient and absurd
The positive case for dynamic pricing is made persuasively by Yossi Cohen, who sells such services. The Israeli 
cofounder of Quicklizard explains how his company combines historic data, prodco- uct inventories and cost 
structures with external variables, such as competitors' prices, economic indicators and the weather, to automate 
pricing decisions. "We help companies find the sweet spot on the demand curve," says Cohen.
The industry yardstick is that dynamic pricing can increase a retailer's bottom line by 7 to 10 per cent, which makes 
a critical difference in a sector notorious for thin margins. But he argues that the ubiquity of price comparison sites 
also empower consumers to get the best deals. "Online commerce has changed the equilibrium in favour of the 
consumer," Cohen says.
Intuition would suggest that an online retailer's ability to track and automatically respond to rivals' price cuts should 
increase competition. But two papers, authored by Alexander MacKay, an assistant professor at Harvard Business 
School, concluded the opposite.
In studying how dynamic pricing works in the real world, MacKay found that when a company with a sophisticated 
pricing algorithm instantly matched its rivals' price cuts, product prices rose over time. A competitor with inferior 
technology would have no incentive to lower prices. "That takes price competition off the table," says MacKay.
Even if there is no overt price collusion to excite the interest of the antitrust authorities, dynamic pricing can weaken 
competition. Savvy, time-rich consumers might be able to shop around and take advantage of timelimited offers and 
promotions, but others cannot. "The beautiful thing about competition is that when there is a lot of it consumers do 
not have to be particularly sophisticated to benefit from it," MacKay says.
In the past, regulators have stepped in to correct abuses of pricing innovations and market power. So, for example, 
retailers are banned in many countries from selling goods at below cost to drive competitors out of business.
But the challenge of regulating online marketplaces is mind-bendingly complex considering their velocity and 
opacity. Companies can also personalise offers, meaning no two customers necessarily see the same one. The 
ecommerce giant Amazon changes prices 2.5m times a day across all its product lines.
History suggests blanket price controls are a bad idea. MacKay and his coauthors offer two more innovative 
remedies. One would be to limit the frequency with which online companies can change prices. The second would 
be to bar companies from including competitors' prices in their own algorithmic models. Both measures would

Taking off EasyJet looks forward to busy summer

Low-cost airline easyJet said the operational problems plaguing the airline industry would not derail a strong 
summer, but cautioned that the financial pressures facing consumers might threaten demand later in the year.
The London-listed airline said yesterday that it expected to fly 90 per cent of its pre-pandemic schedule between 
April and June, rising to 97 per cent for the following three months.
Bookings have risen to 6 per cent above 2019 levels in the past 10 weeks, thanks to a surge in demand for leisure 
and domestic flying as travel restrictions have eased.
EasyJet's aims are more cautious than those of rival Ryanair, which this week outlined plans to fly 115 per cent of 
its 2019 schedules in the summer.
The rapid recovery has come as parts of the aviation industry have struggled to cope with the sudden influx of 
passengers. EasyJet was forced to cancel scores of flights this spring because of staff shortages exacerbated by a 
wave of Covidrelated absences.
The airline went as far as stripping out some seats from its planes to allow it to fly with fewer crew under flight 
safety regulations, but chief executive Johan Lundgren said: "Bookings are not affected and are particularly strong, 
it shows the pent up demand is there."
EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss of £545mn for the six months to the end of March, down from a loss of £701mn the 
previous year and in line with guidance. Revenues rose more than fivefold to £1.5bn. Philip Georgiadis

BA owner IAG snubs Airbus for Boeing deal

BRITISH Airways' owner IAG struck a deal with Boeing to buy a fleet of 50 new 737 Max planes, which will be 
delivered between 2023 and 2027.
The group said it had agreed to buy 25 of the 737 MAX 8200 planes - first ordered by low-cost airline Ryanair - and 
another 25 of the 737 MAX 10 aircraft, as well as 100 options.
Although Boeing's 737-8200 and 737-10 planes are usually sold for $120m and $130m, it was understood that IAG 
got a substantial discount on the list price.
"The addition of new Boeing 737s is an important part of IAG ´s short-haul fleet renewal," said IAG's chief executive 
Luis Gallego.
"These latest generation aircraft are more fuel efficient than those they will replace and in line with our commitment 
to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050."
Aviation analyst Sally Gethin said IAG's decision could have an impact on relations with rival Airbus.
"On the one hand it is standard practice among many airlines to operate a mixed fleet," she told City A.M.
"However IAG has traditionally gone with Airbus for short-haul so it marks a turning point."
IAG is no stranger when it comes to operating a mixed fleet but, according to Gethin, delays at Airbus could have 
played a part in the decision.
BA owner IAG snubs Airbus for Boeing deal
"There is a backlog to the A320 family of more than 5,000 aircraft, with customers facing delays, whereas there is 
little to no delay in deliveries of the MAX," she added.
"In fact the order for the MAX aircraft has been reduced from IAG's original announcement pre-pandemic."
Nevertheless, IAG's order was seen as a clear signal of support to the plane maker amid a turbulent time.
Boeing was forced at the end of April to halt production of its 777X jets after it posted steeper losses than initially 
anticipated. In the first three months of 2022, the US manufacturer reported a net loss of $1.24bn.
The manufacturer's issues also caused strained relations with some of its biggest clients. Air Canada snubbed it in 
favour of Airbus, while Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline would revert to the secondhand 
market if Boeing's management didn't step up.

British Airways owner IAG has agreed to purchase 50 Boeing 737 Max jets, handing the US aerospace group a 
much-needed boost as it struggles to overcome production delays.
IAG yesterday said the order for the narrow-bodied aircraft was worth $6.25bn at list prices, but that it had secured 
a "substantial discount" following negotiations.
The deal is a fillip for Boeing's 737 single-aisle workhorse jet, and comes as the Seattle-based company has faced 
criticism for delayed deliveries and business lost to rival Airbus.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary this week said Boeing needed new management to help turn round 
problems within its commercial aviation business, which have included certification issues on its big aircraft 
programmes.
Boeing has been steadily securing orders for the Max since it was declared safe to fly again by US aviation safety 
regulators in November 2020. Other regulators followed shortly afterwards. About two-thirds of the planes sold by 
the company in 2021 were variants of the Max.
IAG will take delivery of 25 Max 8200 aircraft, which are based on its core design for the single-bodied aircraft, and 
a further 25 Max 10, a newer, larger variant that is yet to be certified by aviation safety regulators.
Boeing given much-needed lift as IAG orders 50 737 Max jets Airlines
Deliveries are scheduled to take place between 2023 and 2027, and the planes can be used across IAG's stable of 
airlines, which includes BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus. The IAG deal also contained options to order a further 100 jets.
The order represents a smaller version of an initial commitment made by IAG for up to 200 Max jets at the 2019 
Paris air show.
Willie Walsh, the then chief executive of IAG, gave his backing to the manufacturer, telling reporters that he had 
"every confidence" in Boeing.
The announcement was seen as a significant vote of confidence in the Max, which, at the time, was still grounded 
after two deadly crashes that killed 346 people and tarnished the reputation of the US aircraft manufacturer.
Yesterday Walsh's successor Luis Gallego said the Max order was an "important part of IAG's short-haul fleet 
renewal", and that their fuel efficiency would help drive down carbon emissions. "With the selection of the 737-8-
200 and larger 737-10, IAG has invested in a sustainable and profitable future, as both variants will significantly 
lower operating costs and CO2 emissions," said Stan Deal, president and chief executive of Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes.
"Today's agreement ... reflects our commitment to support the group's continued network recovery and future 
growth with Boeing's unrivalled family of aeroplanes."

Belarus charges dissident with organising 'terrorist' group

May 20, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarus has launched new criminal charges against the co-founder of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta, 
Stepan Putilo, accusing the dissident of organising[1] a 'terrorist' organisation, according to the Belta state news 
agency. 
Run from abroad, the Nexta Telegram channels helped mobilise historic anti-government protests[2] in the ex-
Soviet country in 2020 after the disputed re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko for a sixth term in power. 
The channel was co-founded by Putilo and Roman Protasevich[3], another Belarusian activist who was arrested in 
Belarus in May last year when his Athens to Vilnius Ryanair flight was diverted and forced to land in the Belarusian 
capital, Minsk. 
Putilo currently lives in Poland's capital Warsaw, while Protasevich remains under house arrest in Belarus after he 
appeared in confession videos that allies believe were made under duress. 
'So-called protests' 
According to Belta, Belarusian investigators on Friday said Putilo and another Nexta staffer Yan Rudik were 
charged with 'directing the activities of a terrorist organisation Nexta'. 
'Since 2020, the defendants have used their information resources to destabilise the situation on the territory of 
Belarus and radicalise the so-called protests,' investigators added. 
They said, 'The terrorists have repeatedly called for inciting social hatred and discord, blocking roads and 
coordinating street riots, committing terrorist attacks on the railway and sabotage at enterprises that could lead to 
man-made disasters.' 
Putilo already faces a number of criminal charges such as inciting social hatred and treason, and is on international 
wanted lists in Belarus and Russia. 
In 2020, Putilo and Protasevich were placed on Belarus's 'list of terrorists', while Nexta was designated a 'terrorist 
organisation'. 
On Wednesday, Belarus - the only country in Europe that continues to carry out executions - introduced the death 
penalty for attempts to carry out acts of 'terrorism'.

 In the past week, there were quite a few updates on the impending takeover of Spirit Airlines SAVE[1]. On May 16, 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[2], after being rejected initially on May 2, refused to give up and launched a hostile all-cash 
unsolicited tender offer to acquire all the outstanding shares of SAVE's common stock. However, the latter's 
management stuck to its stance and turned down the offer put forth by the former yet again. 
United Airlines' UAL[3] management gave an improved revenue guidance for the June quarter as bookings 
continue to get healthier. In another encouraging update, UAL received the green signal from the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) to operate its fleet of 52 Boeing 777s again. The jets are powered with Pratt & Whitney 
engines. The planes have been grounded since February 2021 after a Honolulu-bound flight suffered an engine 
failure and made an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport. On the earnings front, Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[4] reported narrower-than-expected loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 
2022). 
Also, Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Areas Inteligentes GOL[5] announced that there will be a change at its helm 
with a new CEO in place from July this year. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.In an SEC filing dated May 16, 
United Airlines' management projected total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) 
for second-quarter 2022 to increase in the 23-25% band from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Per the previous 
TRASM forecast, given last month while releasing first-quarter 2022 results, the metric was expected to increase 
roughly 17% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. However, due to rising oil price, UAL, currently carrying a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold), increased its average aircraft fuel price per gallon forecast for the June quarter. Management now 
expects[6] the metric to be $4.02, higher than the previous estimate of $3.43.

2. In a letter addressed directly to the Spirit Airlines shareholders, JetBlue on May 16 tweaked its purchase price to 
$30 per share (without interest and less any required withholding taxes). At that time, SAVE's board of directors 
advised its shareholders against taking any rash action at the moment and decided that the board will first carefully 
review JetBlue's tender offer[8]. After reviewing, SAVE's board urged its shareholders to reject the $30 per share 
cash tender offer, citing regulatory concerns.

3. Ryanair incurred a loss (excluding 50 cents from non-recurring items) of 98 cents per share in the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. However, the amount of loss 
narrowed significantly year over year. Quarterly revenues of $1,319.6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $1,356.3 million but improved significantly year over year with higher traffic despite lower average fares 
(down 27% year over year due to Omicron-induced woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Ryanair expects 
summer 2022 average fares to be higher than the summer 2019 level. RYAAY expects fiscal 2023 traffic to be 165 
million, higher than the fiscal 2022 figure as well as 149 million registered in fiscal 2020 (pre-pandemic). RYAAY 
anticipates a return to profitability in fiscal 2023[9]. 
4. Gol Linhas announced that its President and CEO Paulo Kakinoff is set to shift from his current position to 
become a member of the board of directors. Kakinoff will be succeeded by Celso Ferrer, the vice president of 
operations. This transition will be effective Jul 1, 2022. Celso joined GOL in 2003 and has served the carrier in 
various capacities ever since[10]. 
GOL was also in the news recently when it reported impressive traffic numbers for April, driven by the improving air-
travel demand scenario in Brazil. That story was covered in detail in last week's write-up[11]. Performance The 
following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, led by the upsurge in 
the Spirit Airlines stock. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 3.8% to $69.37. Over the past six months, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 19.5%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With the first-quarter 2022 
earnings season over for the airlines, watch this space for the usual news updates. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

May 20, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Euroseas Ltd. ESEA[1] is slated to release first-quarter 2022 earnings numbers on May 23, after market close. 
The company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, 
while missing the same in the other two. 
Let's see how things are shaping up for Euroseas this earnings season. Factors to Note With economic activities 
gaining momentum, strength in the shipping market is expected to have boosted Euroseas' first-quarter 
performance. Increased charter rates in container ship markets are likely to have aided the company's top-line 
performance. 
However, high operating expenses due to increased crewing costs for vessels, thanks to coronavirus-related 
restrictions, are likely to have hurt Euroseas' bottom line in the first quarter. Euroseas Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise 
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/ESEA/price-eps-surprise?icid=chart-ESEA-price-eps-surprise 
Euroseas 
Ltd. 
price-eps-surprise[2] | Euroseas Ltd. Quote[3] Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively predict 
an earnings beat for Euroseas this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP[4] and a Zacks Rank 
#1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of a positive surprise. However, that is not the case here. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5]. 
Earnings ESP: Euroseas has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate are pegged at $3.34. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported 
with our Earnings ESP Filter[6]. 
Zacks Rank: Euroseas carries a Zacks Rank #3. Highlights of Q4 Earnings Euroseas reported fourth-quarter 2021 
earnings of $3.17 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.99 per share. The bottom line improved 
significantly year over year. Total revenues of $40 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.46% and 
surged year over year. Snapshots of Sectorial Releases Below we presentrecently released earnings numbers of 
some companies within the Zacks Transportation[7] sector. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[8], carrying a Zacks Rank #3, incurred a loss (excluding 50 cents from non-recurring 
items) of 98 cents per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022), narrower than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. However, the amount of loss narrowed significantly year over year. Results 
were hurt by the impact of Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine war on travel demand. 
Will Cost Headwinds Dampen Euroseas ' ( ESEA ) Q1 Earnings?
Ryanair Holdings' quarterly revenues of $1,319.6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,356.3 
million but improved significantly year over year with increase in traffic despite lower average fares (down 27% year 
over year due to Omicron-induced woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine). 
Kirby Corporation KEX[9], carrying a Zacks Rank #3, reported first-quarter 2022 earnings of 29 cents per share, 
which met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the year-ago period, the company had incurred a loss of 6 cents per 
share. 
Kirby's total revenues of $611 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $583 million and also 
improved approximately 23% year over year. The upside was driven by higher revenues at the marine 
transportation, and distribution and services segments.

These are the 12 EU countries where masks are still mandatory on flights

Face masks are no longer needed on planes according to the European Union, after the official guidance changed 
on Monday (16 May).
But while maskless flights are the new default, around half of EU countries are keeping them in place for the time 
being.
Top holiday destinations Italy, Spain and Cyprus are among the 12 nations maintaining the rule, following the 
announcement by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last week.
The move, which was welcomed by other travel sector bodies, was described by EASA's executive director Patrick 
Ky as "a big step forward in the normalisation of air travel" for passengers and crews.
Before you throw away your mask, here are the rules to know.
Which countries still require masks on aeroplanes in the EU?
In full, the EU countries still enforcing mask-wearing on planes and around airports are: Austria, Cyprus, Estonia, 
Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
Greece, France and Czech Republic are no longer on this list. And it's likely that more countries will follow suit as 
Covid travel restrictions continue to ease.
 In the meantime, people on domestic or international flights between these countries should still wear a mask.
In its joint statement with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on 11 May, EASA made 
clear that national regulations override the EU-wide change.
"Wearing face masks at airports and inflight should be aligned with national measures on wearing masks in public 
transport and transport hubs," they said, including on flights away from one of these 12 countries.
Italy has confirmed that its mask mandate will remain in place until at least 15 June. It stipulates that more 
protective FF2 masks must be worn on planes and other forms of public transport rather than fabric or homemade 
ones.
These are the 12 EU countries where masks are still mandatory on flights
Should you wear a mask on planes anyway?
The rule change came with a note of caution from the ECDC, which acknowledged that masks are still one of the 
best methods for reducing Covid transmission.
Director Andrea Ammon said that aircraft operators should continue to "encourage" passengers and crew to wear 
masks during the flight and around the airport. So even in countries like Denmark and the UK where masks are not 
mandatory, don't be surprised to hear a pre-flight announcement to this effect.
"Passengers should however behave responsibly and respect the choices of others around them," said EASA's 
Patrick Ky.
"And a passenger who is coughing and sneezing should strongly consider wearing a face mask, for the 
reassurance of those seated nearby."
Vulnerable passengers should continue to wear a face mask regardless of the rules, the joint statement added.
What do Ryanair, easyJet and Jet2 say about masks?
Airlines have welcomed the EU's relaxation on face masks, and taken it as an endorsement to loosen their own 
rules.
Ryanair has also made masks optional on all flights except those to/from countries that are still enforcing them.
"We expect these states to relax their face mask rules over the coming days in line with these new health guidelines 
from EASA and the ECDC," CEO Eddie Wilson added.
British Airways and easyJet had already relaxed their rules in late March, making masks optional except where 
either the country of departure or destination demands them. And Jet2 was the first to do so as early as 1 March, 
but deemed scarves and snoods a "no-no" for countries still requiring in-flight masks.

International Airlines Group (IAG) (IAG) will order 50 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with options for another 100, 
partly firming up plans for a tentative order announced back in 2019.
The agreement will see IAG order 25 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft, and 25 Boeing 737-10. It includes options for a 
further 100 aircraft. The Boeing narrowbodies will be available to its group airlines, which include British Airways, 
Iberia, Aer Lingus, and Vueling.
IAG surprised the industry by signing a letter of intent (LoI) for 200 MAX aircraft at the Paris Air Show in 2019. The 
LoI represented a show of confidence in the MAX after the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline crashes in 2018 and 2019, 
which killed 346 people and resulted in the grounding of the narrowbody jet.
"The addition of new Boeing 737s is an important part of IAG´s shorthaul fleet renewal," IAG chief executive Luis 
Gallego commented in a statement on May 19, 2022. "These latest generation aircraft are more fuel efficient than 
those they will replace and in line with our commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050."
The new Boeing aircraft will be delivered between 2023 and 2027 and "can be used by any airline in the Group for 
fleet replacement", IAG said in a stock exchange filing. The options are available for delivery between 2025 and 
2028.
The order will come as a big boost for Boeing, especially after a report that China Southern is removing over 100 
MAX jets from its near-term delivery plan. The MAX remains grounded in China.
IAG said it had negotiated "a substantial discount" from the list prices of the jets. The 737-8200 has a list price of 
approximately $120 million and the B737 10 of US$130 million. Airlines and lessors typically negotiate discounts to 
list prices.
The 737-8200 is the same MAX as ordered by Ryanair, while the 737-10 is the largest variant of the MAX, seating 
up to 230 passengers.
The variant designated 737-8200, was launched by Boeing in September 2014. It is a high-density version of the 
737-8 MAX, the 737 MAX 200, named for seating for up to 200 passengers in a single-class high-density 
IAG finally places order for 50 Boeing 737 MAX jets for British Airways , Iberia , Aer Lingus , and Vueling
configuration with slimline seats; an extra pair of exit doors is required because of the higher passenger capacity. 
Boeing states that this version would be 20% more cost-efficient per seat than current 737 models, and would be 
the most efficient narrow-body on the market when delivered, including 5% lower operating costs than the 737 MAX 
8. Three of eight galley trolleys are removed to accommodate more passenger space. An order with Ryanair for 100 
aircraft was finalized in December 2014.
Ryanair had been in talks with Boeing to order the 737-10 but ended negotiations in 2021 over pricing differences. 
Although Ryanair has taken more MAX deliveries than initially planned this summer, Michael O'Leary said during a 
results presentation on May 16, 2022, that Boeing needed to "up its game" and fight back to win market share.

D ave Calhoun became boss of Boeing at its lowest ebb two years ago. His mission was to restore confidence after 
revelations that Boeing had misled regulators to speed up certification of the flawed 737 Max jet, with deadly 
consequences. Today it may take the departure of Calhoun, or some of his senior managers, to achieve that.
The heads of Ryanair, Emirates, leasing companies Avolon and Air Lease Corporation have called for a change in 
the company's performance, culture, strategy, and even leadership. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair this week said 
Calhoun was "running out of time".
The comments follow a dire firstquarter results announcement last month. Boeing unveiled several changes and 
delays; most of its civil aircraft and defence programmes are not going to plan.
It wants to shift its headquarters from Chicago to Arlington, Virginia, home to the Pentagon, hobnobbing distance 
from Washington DC and a more convenient location for some on the executive team who remain based on the 
east coast.
For some commercial-aircraft customers there may only be one conclusion to be drawn from the decision to move 
even further away from Seattle, where the company's traditional aero- space expertise lies: Boeing management 
would rather shelter under the wing of government than get to grips with the tougher challenges of execution on its 
key programmes.
Boeing needs a sharper vision to bounce back from crisis INSIDE BUSINESS AMERICAS
This is surely not management's intention. But such signals matter. Boeing certainly does not need a bigger 
presence in Washington. Last year it ranked as one of the top 20 corporate spenders on lobbying services, 
according to the Open Secrets website.
The decision is raising questions over how much has changed in the two years since Calhoun took over.
One of his first pledges was to invest in the engineering capabilities that are crucial to programme execution. It was 
an acknowledgment that engineering skills had been hollowed out by years of cost-cutting, outsourcing and an 
excessive focus on shortterm gains that drove Boeing shares to a sevenfold rise between 2010 and 2019.
It might be prefer to shelter Washington's get to grips challenges of
In the past year, Boeing has spent roughly three times its budget for pay rises outside the usual annual increases, 
amounting to $22mn, according to engineering union magazine Spotlite, while the company has said some 3,500 
new engineers were hired in 2021. But continuing problems suggest more needs to be done.
An obvious way to show commitment to engineering, and to commercial customers, would be to locate top brass in 
Seattle. It could be argued that leadership's distance from the commercial operation was partly to blame for the 
problems that led to the Max disaster. Engineers could no longer voice their concerns to top management in 
person.
Boeing said that it was "confident about the future, because of the hard and important work we've done". This 
included enhancing safety and quality systems and strengthening engineering.
"The effect of these fundamental changes will be measured in years. Some have even created challenges for us in 
the short term. But they are the right steps to take."
But Boeing's longer-term vision remains unclear. Richard Aboulafia, consultant with AeroDynamic Advisory, points 
out that Boeing has underspent on commercial research and development over the past five years compared to its 
rival Airbus.
This has to change if the company is to make up lost ground. Boeing has promised that R&D will grow by double 
digits this year. But greater ambition is required. The only way it will catch up on Airbus's lead is to ditch the short-
termism of previous management and invest in a new aircraft that offers greater benefits than those of its rival.
To do that, Boeing may need to launch a large fundraising. With debt at $45bn, versus Airbus's net cash, it is not in 
a position to invest the $10bn that would be required for a new jet.
The company insists that a rights issue is not on the cards. But some analysts estimate that Boeing could require 
$20bn or more to manage its current challenges and take on Airbus with a new aircraft.
That would rank among the largest equity fundraisings in history. Investors are unlikely to foot the bill without 
extracting a price.
If the much-promised improvement in execution does not materialise soon, there is a risk that Calhoun and/or his 
top management may be the ones to pay.

To do that, Boeing may need to launch a large fundraising. With debt at $45bn, versus Airbus's net cash, it is not in 
a position to invest the $10bn that would be required for a new jet.
The company insists that a rights issue is not on the cards. But some analysts estimate that Boeing could require 
$20bn or more to manage its current challenges and take on Airbus with a new aircraft.
That would rank among the largest equity fundraisings in history. Investors are unlikely to foot the bill without 
extracting a price.
If the much-promised improvement in execution does not materialise soon, there is a risk that Calhoun and/or his 
top management may be the ones to pay.

D ave Calhoun became boss of Boeing at its lowest ebb two years ago. His mission was to restore confidence after 
revelations that Boeing had misled regulators to speed up certification of the flawed 737 Max jet, with deadly 
consequences. Today it may take the departure of Calhoun, or some of his senior managers, to achieve that.
The heads of Ryanair, Emirates, leasing companies Avolon and Air Lease Corporation have called for a change in 
the company's performance, culture, strategy, and even leadership. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair this week said 
Calhoun was "running out of time".
The comments follow a dire firstquarter results announcement last month. Boeing unveiled several changes and 
delays; most of its civil aircraft and defence programmes are not going to plan.
It wants to shift its headquarters from Chicago to Arlington, Virginia, home to the Pentagon, hobnobbing distance 
from Washington DC and a more convenient location for some on the executive team who remain based on the 
east coast.
For some commercial-aircraft customers there may only be one conclusion to be drawn from the decision to move 
even further away from Seattle, where the company's traditional aero- space expertise lies: Boeing management 
would rather shelter under the wing of government than get to grips with the tougher challenges of execution on its 
key programmes.

This is surely not management's intention. But such signals matter. Boeing certainly does not need a bigger 
presence in Washington. Last year it ranked as one of the top 20 corporate spenders on lobbying services, 
according to the Open Secrets website.
The decision is raising questions over how much has changed in the two years since Calhoun took over.
One of his first pledges was to invest in the engineering capabilities that are crucial to programme execution. It was 
an acknowledgment that engineering skills had been hollowed out by years of cost-cutting, outsourcing and an 
excessive focus on shortterm gains that drove Boeing shares to a sevenfold rise between 2010 and 2019.

RYANAIR yesterday lost its legal battle to have bailout funding provided by the EU to German charter airline 
Condor ruled unlawful.
The EU's General Court said the aid package provided to Condor was legitimate and that Ryanair failed to 
demonstrate the EU
Commission had mishandled funds when bailing out the carrier.
"The General Court dismisses the action in its entirety," the court said.
Condor received a (EURO)550m (£445m) funding package in 2020 after it filed for insolvency following the collapse 
of parent company Thomas Cook in late 2019.
The package was questioned by Ryanair, which filed a lawsuit and was granted an initial victory in June 2021.
Over the last few years, the Dublin-based carrier filed a few lawsuits against EU state aid as part of Michael 
O'Leary's crusade on unfair competition.
According to the chief executive, EU funding to airlines could damage competition in the EU aviation market.

 Reallocating a significant part of its capacity to the strongest markets and radically optimizing the network has been 
instrumental in reducingeasyJet's[1] losses in its first half-year of FY22. The European airline reported a 545 million 
headline loss before tax for the period, an improvement of some 150 million. easyJet benefits from capacity 
reallocation. 
In HY1, easyJet reallocated 1.5 million seats from weaker markets to stronger (leisure) markets, launching 48 new 
routes since January. It continues to build on this by adding capacity at Manchester (plus two aircraft to twenty), 
Milan Linate (plus three to 25), and Paris (plus one to 22) while doubling the fleet at destinations bases from nine to 
nineteen. This includes Greece and Portugal. The carrier will add domestic capacity in the UK and France as well 
as capacity at slot-constrained airports like Gatwick, Porto, Lisbon, and Linate. 
Chief Commercial Officer Sophie Dekker noted that together with Ryanair, easyJet is the only airline to actually add 
capacity for the summer. All legacy airlines in Europe (its main competitors on two-thirds of easyJet's network) and 
even Wizz Air have cut capacity in Q4 by high single-digit to double-digit teen numbers. Compared to 2019 levels, 
there are 46 million fewer seats in the European market. After securing more slots, easyJet will strengthen capacity 
at London Gatwick. As it capitalizes on the reduced size of British Airways at Gatwick, easyJet is now the biggest 
airline in the London area for the first time ever. 
Leisure capacity around Easter was 115 percent of 2019 levels, with load factors up to ninety percent again. Since 
the lifting of Covid restriction in the UK, bookings have been strong: in the last ten weeks, they were up six percent 
on pre-Covid levels. easyJet expects capacity in the current third quarter (April-June) to reach ninety percent op 
2019 and 97 percent in Q4. CEO Johan Lundgren is particularly happy with the strong bookings at easyJet 
Holidays, which are up by 530 percent from 2019. Holidays should contribute to FY22 passenger numbers by some 
1.1 million, adding 100 million in incremental mid-term profit to the Group. 
Ancillary revenues up by 44 percent 
easyJet reported a headline loss before tax was 545 million versus -701 million, in line with itsguidance from 
April.[2] Group EBITDAR was -208 million versus -469 million. Fuel costs increased to 362 million, up from 97 
million, although effective fuel costs per metric tonne were lower. Headline costs excluding fuel were also 
significantly higher to 1.344 billion from 612 million, reflecting higher operating costs from more flying compared to 
the weak 2020-2021 period offset by lower crew, maintenance, and ownership costs. 
easyJet benefits from capacity reallocation
The airline carried 23.4 million passengers, up from 4.1 million the previous year, with Q1 and Q2 about even at 
some 11.6 million. Total revenues increased to 1.498 billion from 240 million, of which 985 million from passenger 
revenues. Revenues per seat were up by 29 percent to 47.61 as load factors increased to on average 77.3 percent 
and even 81 percent in February and March. Ancillary revenues per seat from seat and baggage reservations 
increased by 44 percent to 15.12 or 513 million in total. The airline is seeing benefits from new ancillary products 
that in introduced a year ago. It plans another 'step change' in ancillary revenues. 
The Group ended the year with 3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and money deposits. It repaid 300 million in 
commercial paper and has no maturities until FY23. Net debt stood at 596 million, down from 2.098 billion the year 
before. Net cash generation in HY1 was 109 million and a cash outflow of 159 million.

easyJet has various options to grow or reduce its fleet by adding new aircraft and/or terminating leases. (easyJet) 
Flexibility to grow or reduce the fleet 
easyJet ended the first half-year with a fleet of 322 aircraft, which will grow to 324 by year-end. It projects deliveries 
of nine aircraft in FY22, six in FY23, eighteen in FY24, and 26 in FY25. At the same time, it will start phasing out its 
99 Airbus A319s until 2027 and replace them with higher-capacity A320neo's and A321neo's, of which another 115 
remain on backlog plus 59 purchase options and purchase rights. How it will split deliveries between the two 
variants is still subject to confirmation, but by adding the Neo's, easyjet can upgauge capacity without adding more 
aircraft. Chief Financial Officer Kenton Jarvis said that the fleet could grow to 337 aircraft by FY25, but the carrier 
could also reduce the number to 276 by not extending current lease contracts. Following the sanctions on Russia, 
easyJet returned six aircraft that were sourced from lessors that had ties with Russia.  
Lundgren said that easyJet will keep a strict eye on labor costs by improving productivity and through seasonal 
contracts. Like other airlines, it has been confronted with labor market issues that forced it to cancel many flights in 
April. In response, the airline has taken the odd decision to leave one seat row per aircraft unused to reduce the 
number of cancelations if it would be forced to do so. With new recruitment programs in place, Lundrgen says 'we 
believe we have the right amount of crew for the summer period.' The airline is prepared to pay extra to staff in 
crucial positions like ground handling and airport operations to secure adequate staffing. 
Given the continued short-term uncertainties, easyJet isn't giving guidance on the full year. Forward bookings might 
be positive but remain close in. The airline is not so worried about fuel costs as it has hedged 71 percent of its fuel 
for HY2 at an average of $619 per metric tonne, 49 percent for HY1 2023, and twenty percent for HY2 2023. 
It is also hedged by eighty percent for dollar fluctuations this year and 100 percent on offsetting carbon credits. The 
airline said today that it has updated its interim target of emission reductions, targeting now a 35 percent 
improvement by 2035 compared to an FY2020 baseline. The revised target is based on its Science-Based Targets 
Initiative tool. Since 2000, easyJet claims to have reduced carbon emissions per passenger by 33 percent. 
Improvements must come from fleet renewal, operational efficiencies, improvements in air traffic management, and 
scaling up the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Earlier this week, we discusses easyJet's sustainability 
strategy with Director of Flight Operations, David Morgan[3].

IAG finally confirms MAX deal but for fewer aircraft

May 19, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 After two years, eleven months, and one day,International Airlines Group[1] (IAG) finally confirmed its intention to 
buy the Boeing MAX. The airline group said on May 19 that it will purchase 25 MAX 8200s and 25 MAX 10s, plus 
100 options. IAG finally confirms MAX deal but for fewer aircraft. 
On the second day of the 2019 Paris Airshow on June 18, IAG announced a Letter of Intent[2] for up to 200 MAX 8 
and -10 aircraft. That was in the early days of the MAX crisis following the grounding in March after the two fatal 
accidents. The LoI was seen as a morale boost for Boeing from one of the world's leading airline groups, who still 
had confidence in the type despite having no clue how the MAX troubles would be solved. 
Even after the MAX 8 and -9 were recertified again at the end of 2020, IAG failed to confirm its LoI and only said 
that negotiations were ongoing. It made Ryanair's Michael O'Leary question if the IAG order was still on at all or if 
the group was having the same troubles as he had in getting the aircraft at a good price. 
IAG says today in a brief media statement that it has negotiated 'a substantial discount from the list price', which it 
provides at being $120 million for the MAX 8200 and $130 million for the MAX 10. It expects to take delivery of the 
fifty aircraft on firm order between 2023 and 2027 and of the options between 2025 and 2028. If IAG will take only 
newly-built aircraft or gets MAX 8s that have been canceled by other customers isn't known. The order is subject to 
approval from IAG's shareholders. 
Original LoI included the MAX 8 and -10 
In the original LoI, IAG wanted the MAX 8 with around 178 seats and the MAX 10 with 230 seats. The firm order 
sees a preference for the MAX 8200 with up to 200 seats, bringing both versions closer together. The situation of 
the MAX 10 is unclear: if the type fails to be certified this year, Boeing risks being forced to do anextensive systems 
update[3] under new US legislation. This could result in significant delays on entry into service. 
The MAX will be placed with any airline within IAG, so British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia, or Vueling. This is in line 
with what then-CEO Willie Walsh said in June 2019, when he stated that by acquiring the MAX, IAG would diversify 
its fleet to spur competition. When Walsh made his remark, IAG was not happy at all with thelate Airbus 
deliveries[4] and used Boeing as a stick to lever his position. 
IAG has been a loyal customer of Airbus and operates a huge fleet of A320ceo and A320neo family aircraft. Most of 
the deliveries to Aer Lingus and BA have been completed, but Iberia and Vueling recently added or swapped orders 
IAG finally confirms MAX deal but for fewer aircraft
for A321neo's. In the distant past, BA, Aer Lingus, and Iberia used to operate the 737-200, 737 Classic, and an odd 
737-800.

May 19, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Golar LNG Limited GLNG[1] is slated to release first-quarter 2022 earnings numbers on May 26[2]. 
The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 
three of the preceding four quarters while missing the same in one. 
Let's see how things are shaping up for Golar LNG this earnings season: Factors to Note European countries 
looking for gas outside Russia amid the war tensions are likely to have driven demand for LNG vessels. This is 
expected to have aided Golar LNG's first-quarter performance. Golar LNG Limited Price and EPS Surprise

Limited price-eps-surprise[3] | Golar LNG Limited Quote[4] 
Improved performance of the shipping unit is expected to have aided the company's top line. Upbeat operations at 
FLNG (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas) Hilli Episeyo are likely to have driven GLNG's first-quarter performance. 
Reduced vessel operating expenses are likely to have aided Golar LNG's bottom line in the first quarter. However, 
an expected softness in FLNG revenues might have hurt the top line. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does 
not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Golar LNG this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings 
ESP[5] and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. 
However, that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our 
Earnings ESP Filter[6]. 
Earnings ESP: Golar LNG has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate are pegged at 25 cents. 
Zacks Rank: Golar LNG sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here[7]. Q4 Highlights Golar LNG's fourth-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding 16 cents from non-recurring items) of 
22 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents. The bottom line improved more than 
100% year over year. Adjusted revenues of $115.4 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $114 million. The 
top line dipped 2.8% year over year, primarily due to a 9.7% decline in FLNG revenues. Snapshots of Sectorial 
Releases Below we present the first-quarter results of some companies within the Zacks Transportation[8] sector. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[9], carrying a Zacks Rank #3, incurred a loss (excluding 50 cents from non-recurring 
items) of 98 cents per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022), narrower than the Zacks 
What's in the Cards for Golar LNG ( GLNG ) in Q1 Earnings?
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. However, the amount of loss narrowed significantly year over year. Results 
were hurt by the impact of Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine war on travel demand. 
Ryanair Holdings' quarterly revenues of $1,319.6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,356.3 
million but improved significantly year over year with increase in traffic despite lower average fares (down 27% year 
over year due to Omicron-induced woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine). 
Kirby Corporation KEX[10], carrying a Zacks Rank #3, reported first-quarter 2022 earnings of 29 cents per share, 
which met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the year-ago period, the company had incurred a loss of 6 cents per 
share. 
Kirby's total revenues of $611 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $583 million and also 
improved approximately 23% year over year. The upside was driven by higher revenues at the marine 
transportation, and distribution and services segments.

Wizz Air to establish Malta -based carrier

Wizz Air Holdings has announced plans to launch a Maltese subsidiary - Wizz Air Malta (Malta Int'l) - in October this 
year using Malta-registered aircraft.
The budget carrier said only that its new carrier will shortly apply to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency 
(EASA) for an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) and the Malta Civil Aviation Directorate (CAD) for an Operating 
Licence (OL).
The move comes after EASA and the CAD signed an Arrangement on Reallocation of Responsibility agreement on 
May 17 which will allow Wizz to operate across several EU AOCs while subject to a single regulatory authority.
"This will be a new step in the already well-established cooperation between the Agency, the Maltese Civil Aviation 
Directorate and Wizz Air," Patrick Ky, Executive Director of EASA, said. "This new set-up, where one group will 
operate multiple AOCs based in different Member States, but overseen by the same Competent Authority, 
demonstrates the possibilities available through the transfer of responsibilities to EASA. We are looking forward to 
working together on the issuance of this brand-new AOC and the subsequent oversight activities."
Wizz Air Holdings' other EU-based AOC is Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) in Hungary while its non-EU-based entities 
include Wizz Air UK (W9, London Luton) and Wizz Air Abu Dhabi (5W, Abu Dhabi Int'l). It recently announced plans 
for a possible Saudi operation implying the need for a possible AOC there as well.
Rival Ryanair Holdings has already gone the Maltese route setting up Malta Air (AL, Malta Int'l) in 2019. It currently 
operates twenty-four B737-8-200s and 120 B737-800s.

Ryanair has opened its first aircraft heavy maintenance facility in Ireland at Shannon Airport, delivering an 
investment of (EURO)10 million and creating 200 high-skill jobs in the locality, including licensed engineers, 
mechanics, and support staff.
The Irish LCC will invest (EURO)10 million in this state-of-the-art 3-bay facility, leased from Shannon Group, (5,220 
m2) which will support the maintenance of Ryanair's fleet as it grows to 600 aircraft by 2026. This investment 
resounds Ryanair's commitment to the mid-west region & Ireland as a whole as it further drives post-pandemic 
recovery through connectivity, inbound tourism & employment.
The airline has operated from Shannon Airport since 1986, opening its base at the south-western airport in 2005 
and carrying over 17 million customers to/from the airport to date.
Ryanair Director of Operations, Neal McMahon, said:
"We are delighted to announce the opening of our new aircraft maintenance facility at Shannon Airport - our first 
heavy maintenance facility in the country. This facility will create 200 high-skill jobs, demonstrating Ryanair's 
continued growth & commitment to Ireland.
Ryanair creates opportunities for highly skilled engineering jobs, with our industry leading rosters and the youngest 
fleet in Europe. Shannon is an ideal location with opportunities to attract, train and employ local talent to support 
this new facility.
This state-of-the-art 3-bay facility represents a significant (EURO)10 million investment and will support the 
maintenance of Ryanair's fleet as it grows to 600 aircraft by 2026."
Shannon Group CEO, Mary Considine, said:
"Ryanair's investment at Shannon is a vote of confidence by them in the future of the airport. Having Ryanair at 
Hangar 5, one of ten fully occupied hangars on our Shannon Campus, is another significant boost for the region, 
creating high quality jobs for local aviation specialists.
Ryanair opens first heavy maintenance facility in Ireland at Shannon Airport
The resulting jobs and investment are also consistent with our strategic plan to increase economic growth and 
retain skills and talent in the region. We have a close relationship with Ryanair, with Shannon Airport now having 
more destinations served by Ryanair than in 2019."

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) has lost its most recent legal battle against Germany's 2019 government rescue of rival 
Condor, Reuters reported Wednesday.
The European Union's General Court ruled on Wednesday that the major Irish low-cost carrier had failed to provide 
any evidence to cast doubt on the European Commission's handling of the aid application, Reuters reported. 
Ryanair had won its first case against the bailout of the German charter airline at the Luxembourg-based EU court 
in June.
The European Commission in 2020 approved a loan of 550 million euros ($580 million) guaranteed by the German 
government to Condor, which had declared bankruptcy in September 2019 following the demise of its parent firm, 
Thomas Cook, according to the report.
Ryanair's US-listed shares inched 0.6% higher in recent Wednesday early premarket activity.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) lost its appeal in the EU General Court against the German government's bailout of charter 
airline Condor, Reuters reported Wednesday.
Ryanair had won a first challenge against the bailout in June 2021, but the latest ruling said it had failed to prove 
any grounds for doubt regarding the handling of the aid application.
The Irish budget airline had filed a number of lawsuits against the European Commission in recent years for state 
aid given to Lufthansa (LHA.F), Air France-KLM (AF.PA) and others, the news outlet noted. The lawsuits saw some 
initial success but the aid was granted later after the European Commission addressed the court's concerns.

"Boeing management is running around like headless chickens," Ryanair CEO says in earnings-call tirade. Michael 
O'Leary rips Boeing for delivery delays, calls for management shakeup
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings Inc., tore into Boeing during an earnings call Monday May 16, 
blasting the plane-maker's "very poor management" and calling for a shakeup at the top.
"At the moment, we think Boeing management is running around like headless chickens, not able to sell aircraft, 
and then even the aircraft they deliver, they're not able to deliver them on time," O'Leary said on a post-earnings 
conference call with analysts, according to a FactSet transcript.
Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, has ordered hundreds of planes from Boeing, but deliveries 
have been delayed, forcing the airline to scale back its schedule. Last fall, Ryanair ended negotiations with Boeing 
over an order for Max 10 aircraft over a price dispute.
O'Leary made it clear Monday that he blames Boeing.
"The management of Boeing in Seattle is very poor," O'Leary said Monday's call. "We're their largest customer but 
they need a reboot or a boot up the ass somewhere in Seattle and hopefully, [CEO Dave] Calhoun will deliver it."
O'Leary said Boeing had agreed to deliver a number of 737 Max airliners by this spring, but failed to come through.
"It's probably cost us about 600,000, 800,000 seats in May and June, which is disappointing and still unexplained 
by Boeing," he said.
O'Leary was particularly frustrated by the delay because he said the planes were already manufactured years ago.
"All you had to kind of do is put petrol in them and fly them to Dublin. Really, I don't understand why it's taking you - 
you are taking two or three month delays on that," he said. "But it is redolent of, I think, a very poor management 
performance in Seattle both in competing for market share against Airbus and in just honoring your commitments in 
delivering the planes you promised to deliver."
Ryanair CEO says " Boeing management is running around like headless chickens"
"So, Boeing need a management reboot in Seattle and either the existing manager needs to up its game or they 
need to change the existing management," O'Leary said.
Still, he said Ryanair would be happy to work with Boeing's existing management, "If they get their s* together. ... 
but they need to bloody well improve on what they've been delivering to us over the last 12 months."
"We're a willing customer, but we're struggling with slow deliveries and an inability to do a deal on new aircraft 
despite the number of white tails that are sitting on the ground in Seattle," O'Leary said. "You wonder what the hell 
their sales team have done for the last two years. And frankly, most of them seem to be sitting at home in their jim-
jams working from home instead of out there selling planes to customers."
Last week, Boeing reported its deliveries slipped in April, and its shares have sunk since posting a big first-quarter 
earnings miss. Boeing shares BA are down 31% over the past month and off nearly 40% year to date.
Ryanair's American depository receipts RYAAY are down about 21% year to date, while its Irish-listed shares 
IE:RYA are off about 10% this year. MarketWatch.com

Ryanair 's increased summer capacity shows LCCs will emerge strongly from the pandemic
Ryanair's increased summer capacity shows LCCs will emerge strongly 
from the pandemic

Highlight: Ryanair is increasing its capacity to above pre-pandemic levels and this trajectory shows that the low-
cost carrier (LCC) market will emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever.
Body
Prediction underlines the demand for budget optionsAccording to a GlobalData Q3 2021 Global Consumer Survey, 
58% of respondents said affordability was the main factor in deciding where to go on holiday. This sentiment is now 
being echoed across the travel industry as it ascends to recovery in 2022. Key players in the budget airline sector 
such as Wizz Air, easyJet, and Ryanair have all reported that summer capacity levels are higher than pre-Covid. 
Rising fuel costs will push traditionally loyal passengers to LCCsWith the rising fuel costs, air fares are increasing to 
cover operational overheads. 
Whilst the LCC sector is as much affected by these as full-service carriers (FSCs), the typically young age of their 
aircraft means that many are still more fuel efficient, helping to reduce fuel expenses. The LCC business model is 
also designed to reduce other operational overheads, meaning that fares can stay relatively low despite the current 
climate. Nevertheless, it is important to note passengers should expect to see fare increases across all airlines over 
the next 12 to 24 months. However, operationally, the LCC sector is better equipped to deal with the current crisis. 
This will force the hand of many travellers who may traditionally prefer to stay loyal to flag carriers. Rising living 
costs and increased airfares will undoubtedly lead these passengers to book with low-cost airlines. This is likely to 
impact multiple sectors, especially business travel, where corporate travel budgets have already been squeezed. In 
an April 2021 GlobalData poll, 43.2% of respondents expected their business to reduce their corporate travel 
budgets significantly. Fast-forward to May 2022, this is unlikely to change given the current economic climate many 
businesses are facing. The FSC sector will respond with enhanced loyalty programsWith the inevitable increase in 
airfares, the FSC sector will be forced to find creative ways to enhance its product. In recent years, there have been 
elements of the FSC product which have become indistinguishable from LCC products. This is particularly the case 
in short-haul economy class, where fares have been unbundled to provide customers more choice such as 
baggage, meals, and seat selection. However, other elements of the traveller experience could change, with the 
FSCs needing to separate themselves from the LCC market by creating a unique customer experience. In 
Ryanair 's increased summer capacity shows LCCs will emerge strongly from the pandemic
response, FSCs will create enhanced loyalty programs in a bid to keep hold of their core market, especially in the 
corporate travel sector. This is especially relevant in today's world, with significant advances in big data, AI, and 
machine learning allowing businesses to gain more substantial insight into their customer base. FSCs will utilise this 
to create more personalised frequent flyer programs to help maintain their recovery. Nevertheless, the current 
market sentiment says that cost is by far the most important motivator for travellers. Therefore, LCCs are likely to 
come out of the pandemic stronger than other airlines.

Ryanair chief claims Boeing managers 'not up to the job'

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has called for Boeing to make sweeping changes to its senior 
management to help fix a run of delayed deliveries and lost business to rival Airbus. O'Leary said yesterday that the 
senior managers at Boeing's commercial planes business were "not up to the job", and had not fought hard enough 
to stop the company's market share being "wiped out" by Airbus.
O'Leary said Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun was "running out of time" to fix the problems, but stopped short 
of calling for his removal.
"There has been very poor delivery for the last two years and we think they need management changes on the 
civilian aircraft side because the management team in Seattle is not delivering.
It has not delivered for two years and they're not up to the job," O'Leary said.
Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest customers and O'Leary has been sparring with the manufacturer over a possible 
order worth billions of dollars for 737 Max 10 jets, which the airline called off last year after differences over pricing.
O'Leary said Calhoun was doing a "reasonable job", but needed to change management "pretty damn quickly".
"If he presides over more loss of market share, then maybe, you know, there'll have to be wider management 
changes at Boeing generally," he said.
Ryanair chief claims Boeing managers 'not up to the job'
Ryanair has faced problems over deliveries of the 737 Max and has been forced to "chop and change" its 
schedules because "Boeing keep missing delivery dates", O'Leary said.
Boeing was not available for comment. O'Leary's criticism is the latest sign of frustration among Boeing customers 
as the US group grapples with a string of production delays and certification issues, stoking concerns over its 
management. Dómhnal Slattery, chief executive of the world's second-largest aircraft lessor, Avolon, said this 
month that the company had "lost its way".
Ryanair forecast a return to "reasonable" profitability over the next year as the travel industry recovered from the 
pandemic, but warned that the outlook was fragile and vulnerable to shocks.
The carrier posted a loss of (EURO)355mn for the 12 months to the end of March, towards the lower end of the 
previously guided range of (EURO)350mn to (EURO)400mn, and down from (EURO)1.015bn a year before.

RYANAIR could revert to buying aircraft from the second-hand leasing market if Boeing do not step up production, 
according to boss Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary told analysts yesterday the airline was willing to work with Boeing but said the plane manufacturer's 
management needed to "bloody well improve" when it comes to delivering their aircraft orders, as they were 
"running around like headless chickens".
"Boeing needs a management reboot in Seattle and either the existing management needs to up its game or they 
need to change the existing management," the chief executive explained.
"We're very happy to work with existing management but they need to bloody well improve on what they've been 
doing delivering to us over the last 12 months."
Commenting on the news, travel expert Rob Staines said: "O'Leary's frustrations will hit hard at Boeing which is 
making efforts to reduce its own losses as it emerges from the pandemic and a tough trading environment.
"Operating a sole Boeing fleet, Ryanair is a major customer of the US titan and in true O'Leary style he's made it 
clear if issues such as delivery and pricing aren't improved, he will be marching with his feet."
At the end of last month the US manufacturer posted a $1.2bn loss, falling short of analysts' expectations in both 
the defence and civil aviation side of the business. The company was forced to push the delivery of its 777X jets to 
2025 because of technical and supply issues.
Ryanair boss tells Boeing to 'up its game' quickly
O'Leary's comments followed Ryanair announcing yesterday morning that it had narrowed its losses from £867m to 
£302m, hoping to return to profitability in the current financial year.
But the chief executive said it was "impractical, if not impossible" to provide guidance at the moment because of the 
ongoing impact of Covid-19 and the Ukraine war on holiday bookings.
While bookings had improved in recent weeks because of the summer peak, O'Leary said caution was needed 
when heading into winter.
According to O'Leary, travellers should be prepared to pay more this summer because of the higher demand for 
shorthaul destinations.

May 17, 2022( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 With The Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations fast approaching, many companies and their associated brands in 
the U.K. are attempting to get in on the celebrations and, ideally, to turn a profit. 
While the opportunities may be apparent in terms of attempting to sell a related item to the consumer, incorporating 
the Royal Family into a product and then the way a product is subsequently marketed represents a path that is 
fraught with legal complexity. This is to the extent that even several well-known brands have fallen foul of the rules. 
Print marketing experts Solopress[1] have provided Digital Journal with five regulations that firms need to watch out 
for as a company when referencing Her Majesty's 70-year reign. 
The important points to consider are: 
Don't mention the Royals in your marketing 
In celebration of the Jubilee occasion, The Queen has approved a temporary relaxation of the usual stringent rules 
regarding mentioning the Royals on memorabilia. Platinum Jubilee souvenirs are now allowed to use photographs 
of the Royals provided they meet copyright requirements and comply with official Royal regulations[2]. 
However, strict rules remain when discussing the Royals in other scenarios such as marketing materials. Members 
of the Royal Family should not be shown or made reference to in marketing communications without their prior 
permission[3], which you are unlikely to receive except in special cases such as 'where the event or place is of 
outstanding importance or a national event or there is a close Royal association' (gov.uk[4]). 
As an example of an error, Ryanair's press ad featuring a photograph of Prince Charles with the headline 'Prince's 
secret revealed!' was taken down by the ASA[5] for not seeking permission to use the photograph of Prince Charles 
in the campaign - despite the photos being taken at a public event. 
Don't imply Royal endorsement - directly or indirectly 
If a company does make mention of the Royal Family, it needs to make sure it strays on the side of caution, as 
associating a brand products or event with Royal approval could lead to action being taken. 
As an example of what can go wrong, Irish property developer Hagan Homes were forced to remove adverts[6] 
featuring Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with the tagline 'fit for part-time royalty' due to the implication of 
endorsement and for failing to gain permission to use photographs of the couple. 
Rules for using Royal Arms and Emblems 
Jubilee merchandise: Brands need to tread carefully
The use of Royal Arms and Devices is permitted for souvenirs related to the jubilee event[7], providing they are in 
good taste, free from any form of advertisement and carry no implication of Royal Custom or Approval. These items 
must also be permanent in nature, i.e. made from a 'semi-destructible material', and must be 'specially made for the 
occasion'. 
Outside of these circumstances, however, the Royal Arms and Emblems are not to be used 'in connection with any 
trade or business', as outlined by the Trade Marks Act 1994. The Royal Family's official guidelines[8] state that this 
also includes emblems 'which are so similar as to be calculated to deceive' - meaning you can't create emblems 
which may be confused with the Royal Arms, the Royal Crown and other official devices. This applies regardless of 
context and includes satirical settings and non-marketing communications used by brands. 
The sole exception to this rule is if 'the permission of the Member of the Royal Family concerned has been 
obtained'; however, even if you become a Royal Warrant holder, a strict ruleset[9] exists which prohibits the use of 
the Royal Warrant imagery on banners and adverts on buses, taxis and trains, regulates where and how often 
Royal Arms can appear on packaging and products and prevents holders from using the warrant in a way which 
connotates use by the Royal Family. 
Make sure your products or advertising won't misinform 
Whilst the selling of souvenir and memorabilia products is not prohibited providing they adhere to the above rules, 
it's important to be clear that these products are not official memorabilia. Implying that products are approved by 
Royals or connected to the Royal Family, even in a comedic context, is strictly prohibited. 
It is also important to remember that advertising for these products must not mislead or be viewed as inaccurate. 
As an example of an issue, an advert for a doll of the Duke of Cambridge promising an 'authentic likeness of the 
handsome Prince on his wedding day' was banned by the ASA[10] when it was found that the advert for the doll 
differed from the product sold, with the ASA commenting that 'the face of the doll differed from that advertised in 
being slimmer and painted in a more vibrant, and less realistic, way.' 
Using the terms 'Platinum Jubilee', 'Royal' and 'Queen Elizabeth II' 
Royal Guidance[11] has been released on using royal-related terms during the event. Although the name 'Platinum 
Jubilee' may be used freely for events, projects and buildings relating to the occasion, approval must be applied for 
when referencing terms such as 'Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee', 'The Queen's Platinum Jubilee', 'Royal' or 
'Queen Elizabeth II' for all communications.

Management, recently released the firm's 13F portfolio updates for the first quarter of 2022, which ended on March 
31. Causeway Capital Management was founded in 2001 by Ketterer and Harry Hartford. The Los Angeles-based 
firm chooses stocks from among large and mid-cap companies in developed markets around the world. Their 
screens use quantitative, value-oriented metrics and a 'risk score' to find potential investment opportunities. After 
screening, the investment team chooses the stocks that have the most favorable risk-adjusted returns, price-
earnings ratios and dividend yields. 
Based on its latest 13F report, the firm's top five trades for the quarter were the sale of its Credicorp Ltd. ( BAP[4], 
Financial[5]) stake, additions to Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY[6], Financial[7]) and Canadian National Railway Co.

(ASH[12], Financial[13]). Investors should be aware that 13F reports do not provide a complete picture of a guru's 
holdings. They include only a snapshot of long equity positions in U.S.-listed stocks and American depository 
receipts as of the quarter's end. They do not include short positions, non-ADR international holdings or other types 
of securities. However, even this limited filing can provide valuable information.

 Wizz Air [1]plans to launch operations in October with a new subsidiary based in Malta. The launch date is subject 
to regulatory approval from the Maltese Civil Aviation Directorate (CAD) and Europe's EASA. Wizz Air plans to 
launch Maltese subsidiary in October. 
Wizz announced on May 17 that it has signed a document with both agencies, with the intention to file for an Air 
Operator Certificate with EASA and an Operating Licence with the CAD. The airline already operates under an 
EASA license with multiple AOCs in different member states, including Hungary, Bosnia, and Ukraine. Wizz also 
has independent certificates for its operations in the UK and Abu Dhabi. It said last week that it is exploring options 
for a new subsidiary in Saudi Arabia[2]. 
On its plans for the Maltese airline, CEO Joszef Varadi says in a media statement: 'The successful establishment of 
Wizz Air Malta later this year will help to reinforce our strong position and support our expansion plans in Europe.' 
Until now, the airline has no base on Malta but has grown its presence in nearby Italy, with 22 aircraft based at 
seven different airports. The airline hasn't shared further details of its plans in Malta. If the new subsidiary is in 
some ways a substitute for Wizz' paused operations in Ukraine isn't confirmed. Wizz reported a €-213.6 million 
operating loss in Q3 of FY22.[3]  
Entering the Maltese market brings Wizz Air is direct competition with its main low-cost rival in Europe, Ryanair[4]. 
Through Malta Air, which became operational in June 2019, Ryanair has based 145 Boeing 737-800s and MAX 
8200s on the island to cover markets around the Mediterranean. Since September 2020, the 29 Airbus A320s for 
Lauda Europe also operate with a Maltese AOC. Previously, they were based in Vienna.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] incurred a loss (excluding 50 cents from non-recurring items) of 98 cents per share in 
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 
$1.11. However, the amount of loss narrowed significantly year over year. Results were hurt by the impact of 
Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine war on travel demand. 
Quarterly revenues of $1,319.6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,356.3 million but improved 
significantly year over year with increase in traffic despite lower average fares (down 27% year over year due to 
Omicron-induced woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Fiscal 2022 Results Ryanair's net loss came in at 
€355 million in fiscal 2022 compared with the year-ago period's loss of €1,015 million. Traffic soared more than 
200% year over year to 97.1 million (but still down 35% from pre-pandemic levels). Load factor in the period was 
82%, reflecting an improvement of 11 percentage points from the year-ago period. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price,

Ireland (4.8%) soared more than 100% each. Revenues from other European countries (40.5%) skyrocketed more 
than 200% year over year. 
Scheduled revenues climbed more than 100% year over year due to increase in traffic. Ancillary revenues jumped 
more than 200% year over year in the reported quarter due to strong performance in priority boarding and reserved 
seating, apart from robust traffic. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by more than 200% year over year 
due to rise in sectors flown and high jet fuel prices. Total operating expenses rose more than 100% year over year. 
Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), had cash of €3.63 billion as of Mar 31, 2022, higher than €3 billion as of 
Dec 31, 2021. Outlook Ryanair expects summer 2022 average fares to be higher than the summer 2019 level. The 
company expects fiscal 2023 traffic to be 165 million, higher than the fiscal 2022 figure as well as 149 million

of loss narrowed year over year as well.

The FTSE 100 in the red on weakness in consumer staple, healthcare stocks and poor data from China

The FTSE 100 gave up 15 points, or 0.2%, to 7,403 on weakness in consumer staple and healthcare stocks, while 
poor data from China sparked fresh fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
Saudi Arabian Aramco saw profits skyrocket over 80% in the first quarter on higher post-pandemic demand and the 
Ukraine war.  
Last week the oil giant reclaimed its spot from Apple as the world's most valuable company.     Ryanair reported an 
easing of losses but warned a return to profitability remained uncertain on "fragile" demand.   Europe's largest 
airline had been offering discounts to encourage more customers.    The energy price cap may soon be reviewed 
every three months under Ofgem plans.   The six-monthly changes were criticised for contributing to dozens of 
energy suppliers' failures last year.  
Onto the small caps, Greencoat UK agreed to acquire a stake in the Hornsea 1 offshore wind farm for around 
£400mln.  The renewable infrastructure fund said the acquisition is expected to complete in the third quarter of 
2022.
Netscientific said its subsidiary ProAxsis completed the development and evaluation of an AstraZeneca COVID-19 
antibody test with impressive results.  Work showed the assay delivered "exceptional levels of sensitivity and 
specificity."
Horizonte Minerals swung to a pretax profit in the first quarter as the nickel developer made a large foreign 
exchange gain.  This was a result of the Brazilian Real strengthening against the US dollar.

The City of London's diary is packed for the coming week, with many FTSE 100 giants and FTE 250 favourites 
coming to market with results or trading updates, including Greggs, Royal Mail, Vodafone, Aviva, Imperial Brands 
and easyJet.
With the cost of living crisis on everyone's minds, updates from the Office for National Statistics on wages and 
inflation will be keenly watched.
MONDAY 16 MAY
Going into its final results, Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has already announced full-year traffic levels did not 
recover as much as it had predicted, only to around 76% of the previous year's levels.
Full-year passenger traffic was just over 97mln at last count, compared to pre-Covid levels of 149mln and the 
27.5mln seen in the first year of the pandemic.
As a result it warned that losses would be larger than expected at (EURO)350mln-(EURO)400mln for the year to 
end-March, compared to the (EURO)250mln-(EURO)450mln guidance it gave in December and (EURO)100mln-
(EURO)200mln forecast before that.
As well as the final confirmation of the size of the loss, management's view of the outlook will be also be key.
Elsewhere, the big question is will journalists be wheeling out the ever-popular "Greggs on a roll" headline or will 
there be something less savoury from the Geordie bakers.
Aviva, Royal Mail, Greggs and easyJet fill the City diary for coming week
Greggs PLC (LSE:GRG) warned in its full-year results statement back in March that surging levels of cost inflation 
would crimp profits in the coming year.
(Read the full Greggs preview here)
TUESDAY 17 MAY
On Tuesday we will hear from Vodafone PLC, which has already been in the news over reported talks about a 
merger of its UK mobile business with TalkTalk.
Having expressed an interest in M&A for its tower business or its businesses in the UK, Spain and Italy, investors 
will certainly be expecting an update, though with rivals having announced potential deals in Italy and Spain, hopes 
may not be high.
(Read the full Vodafone preview here)
There will also be half-year results from Land Securities Group PLC (LSE:LAND), where the debate on offices 
continues amid the work-from-home trend.
Also we will hear from cigarette maker Imperial Brands PLC (LSE:IMB), where big investor issues will be the growth 
of next-generation products, as well as cigarette price-mix and volumes.
"The market may also still be considering whether chief executive Stefan Bomhard's five-year plan, launched in 
January 2021 after a string of profit warnings, managerial upheaval and a dividend cut, is attainable or not," said 
analysts at AJ Bell.
In macro matters, wage growth will be the big number to look for as the ONS gives an update on the labour market.
The last set showed February was pretty rosy, overall, with unemployment at 3.8%, below where we were before 
the pandemic, employment unchanged at 75.5% and weekly wages up 5.4% year-on-year, including bonuses.
But with consumer price inflation at around 7% and retail prices inflation at 9%, real wages are negative and that is 
hitting people and companies hard.
WEDNESDAY 18 MAY
When Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.) reported its full year numbers in March the life insurer said it would return £4.75bn to 
shareholders despite seeing decline in profits.
However, the decline reflected Aviva selling eight non-core businesses over the last 12 months, as the business 
focusses on its core markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada.
It has also been joining other financial giants in making a wealth management acquisition, picking up Succession 
Wealth for £385m in an attempt to cement its position as a UK market leader.
As well as saying it was on target to make £750mln in savings by 2024, the former Norwich Union said it expects to 
see continued growth in its savings and retirement business in 2022 through workplace pensions and other related 
sales, while also pledging to up dividend spending 40% to £870mln.
Elsewhere, new Burberry Group PLC (LSE:BRBY) chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd will be making his debut after 
joining from Versace in mid-March.
In an update in January, the board stuck to its medium-term guidance for high single-digit top line growth and said it 
expects adjusting operating profit for the year to grow by 35%.
But supply chain issues, cost inflation and consumer confidence have all become a bigger issue since then.
Aviva, Royal Mail, Greggs and easyJet fill the City diary for coming week
(Read our full preview on Burberry here)
British Land Company PLC (LSE:BLND), the real estate investment trust (REIT), will also be reporting on its full 
year results on Wednesday. 
Ahead of the update, analysts at Barclays said there was still uncertainty about the recovery of the FTSE 100-listed 
REIT, despite a return to profit and increase in net asset value, though analysts upped their target price to 500p 
from 450p.
A day after we hear about UK unemployment and wage growth, the ONS releases the latest inflation data, which 
will show how much the cost of living has worsened.
The consumer price index was 7% in March, its highest level in 30 years, while core prices rose to 5.7%.
Economists predict CPI could reach or even top 9% in April, which would be a record high on the CPI measure, and 
with the Bank of England warning that it could reach 10% towards the end of the year, hence why it has pushed 
through its fourth interest rate and is predicting a potential recession next year.
THURSDAY 19 MAY
After pushing the envelope during the pandemic, on the back of surging demand for online shopping deliveries and 
hopes of improved efficiency, Royal Mail PLC (LSE:RMG) shares have not delivered in 2022.
Heading in its final results on Thursday investors will be fretting about staff costs, as the group aims to cut 700 
management positions but is also facing revolting workers, with unions unhappy about pay amid rocketing cost of 
living.
There are other key factors to watch, says analyst Laura Hoy at Hargreaves Lansdown, in particular how much 
inflation of construction costs is having on automation investments, and whether parcel volumes are settling at a 
higher than pre-pandemic level.
Also on Thursday any investors who have had flights cancelled in recent weeks are likely to be keen to hear from 
easyJet PLC, which last month provided said first-half losses had been trimmed as capacity was increased back 
towards pre-pandemic levels, though it continued to be hampered by increasing numbers of crew testing positive for 
Covid-19.
Losses would be between £535mln and £565mln, it said, and said it had cancelled 6% of its scheduled flights over 
the previous week due to staff absences.
For the third quarter, capacity was expected to be around 90% of 2019 levels, with sales for the fourth quarter said 
to be "near" equivalent levels from the year before the pandemic.
FRIDAY 20 MAY
Close Brothers PLC, the financial services firm, issues a fiscal third-quarter trading update on Friday with Peel Hunt 
expecting banking loan growth to be one of the areas of concern.
The first half of the year saw banking loan growth rise by just 1.9% year-on-year, with the performance held back by 
property book repayments.
The broker is going for full-year growth of 4.2% so Close Brothers has some catching up to do.
Also of concern is the collapse in profits of Winterflood, its broking arm, due to less favourable market conditions.
Elsewhere, there are some notable AGMs, including for Reckitt Benckiser PLC and the first for Deliveroo PLC as a 
listed company, with pay among the key issues.
Aviva, Royal Mail, Greggs and easyJet fill the City diary for coming week
Voting agency Glass Lewis recommends shareholders support Deliveroo's annual remuneration report but oppose 
the company's new remuneration policy.
"It is unhappy with the long-term incentive scheme, which presents a maximum opportunity of 600% of salary for 
the finance boss, rising to an exceptional 750% in the case of recruitment. The voting group says there's potential 
for "extremely high pay-outs", which significantly outpace those of standard-listed peers and those available to 
executives in the FTSE 250," said analysts at Interactive Investor.
In macro news, UK retail sales are also due, having followed a strong start to the year but having slumped sharply 
amid rising prices and a slump in consumer confidence.
March saw a slide of 1.4% driven by a sharp fall in fuel sales as the rising cost of living prompted consumers to 
pare back non-essential spending and drive their cars less, with downward revisions also to February's numbers, 
from -0.3% to -0.5%.
"In cutting back on their spending, consumers will also have had one eye on the upcoming surge in energy bills, as 
well as other price rises, which were due to hit their wallets in April," said analyst Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.
"The most recent BRC retail sales numbers showed that like for like sales fell 1.7% in April, so higher prices are 
certainly having an effect."

May 16, 2022( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair on Monday announced a large reduction in annual net losses as the aviation sector 
recovered from pandemic lockdowns. 
Loss after tax dropped to 355 million euros ($369 million) in the 12 months to the end of March, compared with a 
net loss of 1.0 billion euros in its previous financial year. 
"This recovery, however, remains fragile" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, chief executive Michael O'Leary 
said in a statement. 
"Given the continuing risk of adverse news flows on" Ukraine and Covid, "it is impractical -- if not impossible -- to 
provide a sensible or accurate profit guidance range at this time", he added. 
While Ryanair expects cost increases as a result of surging oil prices fuelled by the war, it hopes "to return to 
reasonable profitability" in its current financial year. 
It forecast passenger traffic of 165 million in its current year, compared with a pre-pandemic level of 149 million. 
The airline flew more than 97 million passengers last year compared with 27.5 million during the previous 12 
months period when the pandemic struck. 
Group revenue almost tripled to 4.8 billion euros last year as travel demand recovered.

months period Photo: AFP / Adrian DENNIS  
Despite surging inflation, Ryanair said its average fares fell more than a quarter to 27 euros. 
But with demand for the summer peak season set to jump, prices were set to rise, according to O'Leary. 
"It seems to us that there will be higher prices into that peak summer period because there's so much demand for 
the beaches of Europe," he told BBC radio. 
Ryanair had expected a much lower loss until the Omicron variant struck in late 2021, hitting fares and causing 
fresh disruption across its European routes. 
The airline said it remained committed to restoring pre-Covid salaries for all its staff as soon as it returns to levels of 
profitability seen before the pandemic struck. 
As well as cutting salaries, Ryanair axed 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15 percent of staff, in the wake of the 
pandemic. 
As travel recovers, however, airlines are in fierce competition to recruit staff and are in some cases offering 
welcome bonuses. 
Ryanair Slashes Annual Loss As Lockdowns Lifted
Following the earnings update, Ryanair's share price slid three percent to 13.21 euros in Dublin trading. 
"There had been high hopes that by now the airlines would be riding high on a burst of pent-up demand from 
holiday makers but a warning from Ryanair that recovery remains fragile, has sent companies into a fresh bout of 
turbulence," noted Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. 
Shares in rival EasyJet dropped 1.5 percent to 491 pence in London.

Masks required on flights to and from Germany despite looser EU rules

Despite loosened EU restrictions from Monday, passengers flying to and from Germany will still be required to wear 
masks in flight, according to the interior ministry in Berlin.
FFP2 or medical masks must be worn during boarding and disembarking and throughout the flight.
They may only be removed for eating and drinking. Children under the age of six are exempt from the requirement.
The ministry explained that the mask requirement corresponds to the new EU recommendations.
The aviation security agency EASA and the EU health authority ECDC no longer recommend that masks be worn in 
airports and on planes as a general rule from Monday.
But if masks are compulsory at the point of departure or the destination, masks need to be worn during the flight.
In Germany the nationwide mask requirement on planes and long-distance trains remains in place until September 
23. Masks are also compulsory on local bus and train transport.
German Transport Minister Volker Wissing and the transport industry have called for the mask requirement on 
planes, trains and buses to be scrapped.
However, the federal government has no plans to abolish the mask requirement for the time being.
Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) explained that, with the number of coronavirus cases still very high, "there is 
no scope to do without masks on public transport."
In general, relaxed EU rules do not mean that masks are no longer required on all flights. Europe's largest low-cost 
airline Ryanair has published a list of 15 EU countries in which national laws still require the wearing of face masks 
to prevent the spread of the virus.
Masks required on flights to and from Germany despite looser EU rules
Besides Germany, these include popular tourist destinations such as Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy.

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported Monday that its fiscal year 2022 loss before 
tax narrowed to 429.8 million euros from last year's loss of 1.11 billion euros.
 Net loss attributable to equity holders of parent was 240.8 million euros, compared to prior year's loss of 1.02 
billion euros. Loss per share was 0.2130 euro, compared to loss of 0.9142 euro last year.
 In this year, adjusted pre-tax loss was 560.3 million euros, and adjusted attributable net loss was 355 million euros.
 Total operating revenues surged 193 percent to 4.80 billion euros from last year's 1.64 billion euros.
 Traffic surged 253 percent to 97.1 million customers from 27.5 million customers last year.
 Load Factor grew 11 percentage points to 82 percent from last year's 71 percent.
 Looking ahead, the company said it expects to return to reasonable profitability in fiscal 2023, despite limited first-
half visibility and almost zero second-half visibility, 20% unhedged fuel and the significant risks posed by both the 
invasion of Ukraine and Covid.
 The company added that it is impractical- if not impossible- to provide a sensible or accurate profit guidance range 
at this time.
 Ryanair plans to grow full year traffic to 165 million from 97 million last year and 149 million in the pre-Covid period.

       Ryanair Holdings Plc reported Monday a loss in its fiscal year 2022, narrower than last year, with strong growth 
in traffic and load factor. Looking ahead, the company said it expects to return to reasonable profitability in fiscal 
2023. Shares of the low fares airline were losing around 4 percent in the morning trading in Germany.
 The company said the outlook reflects limited first-half visibility and almost zero second-half visibility, 20 percent 
unhedged fuel and the significant risks posed by both the invasion of Ukraine and Covid.
 Ryanair plans to grow full year traffic to 165 million from 97 million last year and 149 million in the pre-Covid period.
 Ryanair said in a statement, "This recovery, however, remains fragile. This was clearly evidenced by the sudden, 
and unexpected, emergence of the Omicron variant pre-Christmas and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Feb., 
both of which immediately damaged close-in bookings and yields for the Christmas and Easter peak travel periods. 
Given the continuing risk of adverse news flows on both these topics, it is impractical (if not impossible) to provide a 
sensible or accurate profit guidance range at this time."
 Further, the company said its growth plans to 2026 will see the creation of over 6,000 well-paid jobs for highly 
skilled aviation professionals all over Europe.
 For the full year, loss before tax narrowed to 429.8 million euros from last year's loss of 1.11 billion euros.
 Net loss attributable to equity holders of parent was 240.8 million euros, compared to prior year's loss of 1.02 
billion euros. Loss per share was 0.2130 euro, compared to loss of 0.9142 euro last year.
 In this year, adjusted pre-tax loss was 560.3 million euros, and adjusted attributable net loss was 355 million euros.
 Total operating revenues surged 193 percent to 4.80 billion euros from last year's 1.64 billion euros. Scheduled 
revenues increased 156 percent from last year to 2.65 billion euros. Ancillary revenues surged 258 percent to 2.15 
billion euros.
 Traffic surged 253 percent to 97.1 million customers from 27.5 million customers last year. Load Factor grew 11 
percentage points to 82 percent from last year's 71 percent.
 Meanwhile, average fares were down 27 percent to just 27 euros.
 In Germany, Ryanair shares were trading at 13.20 euros, down 4.1 percent.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a substantially narrowed annual loss as revenue 
recovered, and said a return to profit was within its sights for the current year. 
For the year ended March 31, revenue for the Dublin-based budget airline jumped to EUR4.80 billion from EUR1.64 
billion the year before, as customer numbers recovered to 97.1 million from 27.5 million.
The customer levels are still 35% behind pre-Covid levels, however, Ryanair noted. 
The company narrowed its pretax loss by over half to EUR429.8 million, from EUR1.12 billion a year prior. In pre-
Covid financial 2019, pretax profit was nearing nine figures at EUR948.1 million.
The airline noted the delay in the relaxation of Covid travel curbs in the UK and EU, the impacts of Omicron and the 
Russia invasion of Ukraine all led to fares requiring "significant price stimulation". 
The average fare in the year was down 27% to EUR27. 
However, ancillary revenue helped to offset the decline, as more guests chose add-on services such as priority 
boarding and reserved seating. 
Ryanair hopes to return to a "reasonable" profit in the year. 
"This recovery, however, remains fragile," noted Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary. "Given the continuing risk 
of adverse news flows on [Ukraine and Covid restrictions], it is impractical, if not impossible, to provide a sensible or 
accurate profit guidance range at this time."
Prices still needed stimulation in the first quarter, the company said, but it is hopeful that pent-up demand will drive 
peak fares ahead of pre-Covid levels. 80% of fuel for the year is hedged, and the remaining unhedged 20% will 
likely give rise to cost increases.

       European stocks were broadly lower on Monday after the latest data out of China showed the gloomy impact of 
the country's "zero-COVID" policy.
 Closer home, the European Commission cut its growth forecast for the 19 countries sharing the euro to 2.7 percent 
this year from 4.0 percent predicted in February, citing the impact of the Ukraine war and soaring inflation.
 GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.3 percent next year, below the 2.7 percent seen before.
 Data showed earlier in the day that German wholesale price inflation advanced to 23.8 percent in April from 22.6 
percent in March. This was the biggest rate since records began in 1962.
 Euro zone bond yields were up after ECB policymaker Pablo Hernández de Cos said the European Central Bank 
will likely decide at its next meeting to end its stimulus program in July, and raise interest rates "very soon" after 
that.
 Separately, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said a weak euro threatened price stability in the 
currency bloc.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 slipped 0.1 percent to 432.87 after climbing 2.1 percent on Friday.
 The German DAX and France's CAC 40 index both dipped around 0.4 percent while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 
0.1 percent.
 Irish airline Ryanair fell over 3 percent after it posted a 355 million-euro ($369.06 million) net loss for the 12 months 
ended March.
 Italian water pump company Interpump Group jumped 6.3 percent after unveiling its first-quarter results.
 British power companies Drax and Centrica jumped 3-4 percent after regulator Ofgem proposed more frequent 
changes to the energy price cap.
 Technical products company Diploma slumped 5.2 percent despite the company posting a rise in first-half pretax 
profit and revenue.
 Vodafone Plc shares rallied 2.8 percent after United Arab Emirates-based telecoms company PJSC bought a 9.8 
percent stake in the company for $4.4 billion.
 Unilever declined 1.7 percent on concerns that its margins will face pressure due to inflation.
 Experian Group shares fell 1.7 percent after the consumer-credit reporting agency agreed to acquire a 51 percent 
stake in Brazilian fintech company MOVA Sociedade de Empréstimo entre Pessoas S.A. for a cash consideration of 
40 million Brazilian reais ($7.9 million).
European Shares Broadly Lower On Growth Concerns

 Ophthalmology company Nicox SA gained about 1 percent after it announced a new governance structure.

narrowing from a 0.91 euros loss a year earlier. 
Analysts polled by Capital IQ expected a loss of 0.29 euros per share.
Total operating revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31 was 4.8 billion euros, up from 1.64 billion euros a year 
ago.
Analysts surveyed by Capital IQ expected 4.95 billion euros.
The company said that is continues to believe it will return to "reasonable profitability" in 2023 but that its recovery 
"remains fragile."  The emergence of the Omicron variant pre-Christmas and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 
February both immediately damaged bookings and yields for the Christmas and Easter peak travel periods, it said. 
The company added that it is unable to provide profit guidance given the continuing uncertainty.

'Jumping wheat prices and data indicating a fresh slowdown in China's economy are the unsettling indicators being 
absorbed by investors at the start of the week. The FTSE 100 opened 0.5% lower, before regaining ground as a 
picture emerged of a big drop off in demand in China[2]. Retail sales have plunged in the world's second largest 
economy as a result of the drastic lockdowns brought in to try and curb the spread of Covid. The monthly sales drop 
of 11.1% was a dramatic fall and industrial output also slid by 2.9% showing the toll the zero-covid policy has had 
on the economy. Restrictions in Shanghai are finally easing, but there is a risk that fresh infections will pop up 
elsewhere, leading to yet more restrictions which would continue to restrain a recovery.

VodafoneLeaps To The Top Of The FTSE 100 
Vodafone Group plc (LON:VOD) leapt to the top of the FTSE 100 after it emerged the Abu-Dhabi based Emirates 
Telecommunications Group had acquired a 9.8% stake making it the biggest shareholder. It sees good 
opportunities for growth ahead for Vodafone and it's likely that its leading position in several markets across Africa 
piqued its interest in particular. Vodafone has struggled in its more mature markets where cost appears to be the 
main driver of consumer choice so expanding its geographical reach across the continent and expanding further 
into mobile financial services looks set to be a continued focus. 
Investors Digest China Slowdown And Soaring Wheat Prices, Consumer Uncertainty Hits Greggs And Ryanair 
While Vodafone Leaps Higher
India's skittish move to ban wheat exports, amid supply worries due to the intense heatwave, has heightened the 
risk of global food shortages, and risks adding another dash of fuel to the inflation fire. With such a major wheat 
exporter introducing curbs, it's causing fresh commodity chaos on exchanges, with the price of wheat futures 
contracts traded in Chicago leaping by almost 6%, to the highest level in two months. 
This is another domino effect of the invasion of Ukraine[5], which disrupted supplies from the region and led to a 
sharp increase in prices and higher demand for India's crops, making its inflation problem even more acute. 
Although Modi's administration says it's temporary and contracts with countries facing food security issues in the 
region will be honoured, this will only increase the price of essential ingredients like flour for many manufacturers, 
and pile more pressure on consumers grappling with the cost-of-living crisis. 
Greggs' Worries 
Greggs plc (LON:GRG) is clearly worried that the big squeeze on disposable incomes may lead to some flakier 
sales in months to come. Already cost pressures had been increasing and given that flour is an essential ingredient 
for its array of baked treats, rising wheat costs will be adding to concerns. It has reported a rise in first quarter sales 
but that figure was given a lift as it compares to last year's lockdown period. It's also still suffering from the working 
from home trend, with sales at big city stores still half-baked compared to other locations across its network. But 
Greggs is already undergoing a restructure of its footprint of stores and has been shown to be adept at refocusing 
where demand will be higher. Its takeout options are also likely to stay reasonably resilient over the longer term 
even as the economy is set to slow further, given their value price point and popularity. 
There had been high hopes that by now the airlines would be riding high on a burst of pent-up demand from holiday 
makers but a warning from Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY) today that recovery remains fragile, has sent 
companies into a fresh bout of turbulence. Losses may be narrowing but passengers still appear nervous about 
making advance plans, given that the company is still having to keep slashing prices to bring bookings in. The 
company is blaming the uncertainty unleashed by the invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing covid situation for its lack 
of guidance for the coming year. This has had a knock on effect on easyjet's share price, as worries about labour 
costs also rise amid the news that it's offering bonuses to try and retain staff as the industry grapples with the 
labour crunch."

 The recovery of air travel remains so fragile and financial headwinds are so strong thatRyanair[1] only can say that 
it hopes to return to 'reasonable profitability' in the current FY23. Close-in bookings, low fares, high fuel prices, and 
significant risks from the war in Ukraine and Covid are all disclaimers in its guidance for the new financial year, 
Ryanair said on May 16 in its FY22 results presentation. 
The fragility was confirmed with the emergence of Omicron in December 2021 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
in February, which had an immediate effect on bookings and yields, notably around Easter. The high fuel prices 
forced Ryanair to reduce fares to stimulate travel. Fares are expected to remain under pressure, as has happened 
in previous quarters[2]. While Ryanair is optimistic that it will recover passenger numbers to 165 million from 97.1 
million last year, visibility is too limited right now to provide accurate profit guidance for FY23. 
'There is no doubt that traffic is recovering. We have seen in recent months stronger traffic and higher load factors 
but most of that has been driven by lower fares. In the current first quarter, fares will be below 2019 levels. There is 
a prospect that fares in the September quarter could be ahead of 2019 but that recovery is fragile and could be 
subject to damage quite significantly by adverse news flows', said Michael O'Leary in a prepared presentation. 'But 
we expect Ryanair to grow faster in a recession, as has happened before after 9/11, the Gulf war, and in previous 
economic crises.' 
Full-year loss reduced to 355 million 
Ryanair reduced its FY22 net loss to €-355 million from €-1.015 billion in FY21. The operating loss was €470.1 
million versus €839.4 million. Operating expenses soared to €5.3 billion from €2.5 billion, with fuel costs up by 237 
percent to €1.8 billion and airport handling charges also much higher as traffic increased. 
Total revenues tripled to €4.8 billion from €1.6 billion, of which €2.652 billion is from passenger revenues (FY21: 
€1.036 billion) and €2.148 billion from ancillary revenues (€599.8 million). To stimulate travel, Ryanair lowered its 
fares by an average of 27 percent to €27. The carrier earned on average €22 from ancillary revenues from priority 
boarding and seat reservation. Load factors were up to 82 percent from 71 percent last year. 
Ryanair bolstered its liquidity to €3.6 billion by the end of March compared to €3.2 billion a year earlier. Including its 
assets/fleet, total liquidity stood at €15.2 billion. Net debt was reduced to €1.45 billion from €2.28 billion, with a 
target to get to net-zero debt in FY25 despite the high level of capital expenditure on the fleet. The carrier remains 
committed to restoring in the next three years the five to twenty percent pay cuts for its staff that were imposed at 
Ryanair projects modest profitability in difficult market
the start of the Covid crisis, but negotiations with unions and workforce representatives have yet to produce 
agreements on certain markets. The quicker Ryanair returns to profitability, the quicker the airline will restore the 
pay cuts. The airline says it has no staff shortages but is worried by labor issues at airports and at air navigation 
service providers. 
Ryanair seeking up to fifty second-hand Boeing and Airbus aircraft 
The airline group expects to grow the number of Boeing MAX 8200s for Ryanair, Buzz, and Malta Air from 61 by the 
end of March to seventy this summer, up five from its previous schedule. This has been at Boeing's request. 
Another 55 should join until the coming winter, although Ryanair - like other customers - is struggling to get the 
aircraft on time over supply chain issues. Reliability and fuel consumption of the MAX has exceeded expectations 
while passenger and crews offer positive feedback 
To cope with short and medium-term growth between 2026-2030, Ryanair has submitted requests for proposals for 
up to fifty second-hand, O'Leary said. The airline is in 'advanced discussions with a number of lessors on both 
Airbus and Boeing second-hand aircraft.' But Ryanair prefers to add more MAX to the fleet, especially the MAX 10. 
O'Leary said that he hopes that Boeing 'can finally return to the table' after Ryanair terminated the talks last year 
when Boeing was asking too high prices for the aircraft. O'Leary said in March that he wasin no hurry to get a 
deal[3]. Boeing needs to 'up its game' and win more new orders or risk that Airbus will have it for lunch.

Ryanair claims to have grown its market share in various key markets. (Ryanair) 
The MAX fleet with its high-density cabin should contribute to a capacity increase to 115 percent of 2019 levels this 
summer, with 770 new routes added and fifteen new bases opened. Ryanair expects to gain a forty percent market 
share in Italy, twenty percent in Austria (Vienna), and improve further on the thirty percent in Hungary, 'the home of 
our so-called low-cost competitor.' (Wizz Air). Its share in Ireland is currently at 55 percent, that in Poland at 35 
percent. 
For all airlines, high fuel prices are a big concern, but less so for Ryanair. For FY23, the airline is in a good position 
as it has hedged eighty percent of fuel for mid-sixty to a mid-seventy dollars per barrel with swaps and caps. 'This 
gives us a huge competitive advantage', said O'Leary, who added that the remaining twenty percent still needs to 
be sourced at current high prices. For FY24, ten percent of fuel costs are hedged. The airline has hedged 85 
percent of its carbon credits for FY23.

Ryanair announced a new winter maintenance agreement with UK MRO provider, STS Aviation Group, which will 
see the airline undertake two lines of heavy maintenance at their modern MRO facility in Birmingham. Ryanair's 
fleet will grow to over 600 aircraft over the coming years and this agreement will ensure that the airline has flexibility 
as to where it places its aircraft for upcoming winter maintenance seasons.
Ryanair uses a mix of internal facilities and external suppliers to conduct its heavy maintenance. Ryanair continues 
to invest in internal heavy maintenance facilities and this agreement will complement these facilities to ensure the 
maintenance requirements are more than met over the coming years.
Speaking on the impact of this announcement, Ryanair's Director of Operations, Neal McMahon, said:
"Our 5-year growth plan will grow our fleet to over 600 aircraft and we are pleased to announce this agreement with 
STS Aviation to conduct maintenance at their modern MRO facility in Birmingham this winter. This agreement will 
allow Ryanair to utilise 2 heavy maintenance slots, with aircraft coming in nose-to-tail for the upcoming winter 
season. STS Aviation has an excellent reputation for a quality service offering in the industry and we are pleased to 
be announcing this new deal. This agreement will ensure that Ryanair has flexibility as to where it places its aircraft 
for the winter maintenance season."
Commenting on the deal, Ian Bartholomew, Senior Vice President Business Development Europe at STS Aviation 
Services said:
"We are delighted that Ryanair has selected STS Aviation Services to perform nose-to-tail lines of heavy aircraft 
maintenance at our facility located in Birmingham, UK. This contract win is testament to the professionalism and 
dedication of our entire team, and we look forward to receiving the first aircraft later this year while expanding the 
relationship and supporting the long-term growth of such a prestigious customer."

May 13, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022) financial 
numbers on May 16[2]. 
The company has a dull earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one 
of the preceding four quarters while missing the same in the other three. 
Let's see how things are shaping up for Ryanair this earnings season. Factors to Note Improved air-travel demand 
in Europe is likely to have driven Ryanair's top line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Uptick in traffic is expected to 
have boosted scheduled revenues in the quarter. Ancillary revenues are also expected to reflect significant year-
over-year improvement owing to strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating. 
However, with air-travel demand continuing to be below the pre-pandemic levels, Ryanair's fiscal fourth-quarter 
performance is likely to reflect softness compared with the 2019 level. 
Additionally, escalating fuel prices amid the Russia-Ukraine war are likely to have dented the carrier's bottom line in 
the 
to-be-reported 
quarter.

Ryanair 
Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise[3] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[4] What the Zacks Model Unveils The proven 
Zacks model predicts an earnings beat for Ryanair this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP[5] 
and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Earnings ESP: Ryanair has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at a loss of 
$1.08, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or 
sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter[7]. 
Zacks Rank: Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3. Highlights of Q3 Earnings Ryanair incurred a loss of 48 cents per 
share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Dec 31, 2021), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a 
penny. Results were hurt by Omicron-induced travel restrictions in December. Quarterly revenues of $1,681.1 
million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,792.2 million but increased more than 400% from the year-
ago period, with significant improvement in traffic owing to strong bookings in October and November. Earnings 
Snapshots Within the Zacks Airline[8] industry, Copa Holdings CPA[9], Azul AZUL[10] and Gol Linhas Aereas 
Inteligentes GOL[11] recently reported first-quarter 2022 earnings numbers. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?
Copa Holdings, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, reported first-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 23 cents from non-
recurring items) of 70 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. In the year-ago 
quarter, the company had incurred a loss of $2.23 per share due to coronavirus-led depressed air-travel demand. 
Copa Holdings' quarterly revenues of $571.6 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $566.1 million 
and rose significantly year over year, thanks to an improvement in air-travel demand. 
Azul, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), incurred a loss (excluding $4.89 from non-recurring items) of $1.14 per share 
in the first quarter of 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.21. The amount of loss 
narrowed year over year as well. 
Azul's total revenues of $610.9 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $638.5 million but increased 
82.9% year over year as air-travel demand improved, courtesy of widespread vaccination programs in Brazil.  
Gol Linhas, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, incurred a loss (excluding $3.15 from non-recurring items) of 63 cents per 
share in the first quarter of 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The amount of 
loss has narrowed year over year. 
Gol Linhas' net operating revenues of $616.2 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $603.2 million. 
The top line not only surged more than 100% year over year, but also came in above the first quarter of 2019.

 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

May 13, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Golden Ocean GroupGOGL[1] is scheduled to report first-quarter 2022 [2]results on May 19. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings has been steady at 35 cents over the past 60 days. The 
consensus mark for revenues is currently pegged at $192.7 million. 
Against this backdrop, let's discuss the factors that might have impacted Golden Ocean's performance in the March 
quarter. 
We expect GOGL's first-quarter performance to have been driven by the gradual uptick in economic activities. This, 
in turn, might have perked up its revenues from the year-ago quarter's reported figure despite the Omicron-induced 
woes in the early part of the quarter. 
The optimism surrounding the Drybulk market is likely to have boosted Golden Ocean's top line in the to-be-
reported quarter. Revenues are likely to have increased owing to favorable Drybulk freight rates. Efforts to expand 
its fleet size also point to the increasing demand-scenario. 
However, we expect GOGL's first-quarter bottom-line performance to have been hurt by an escalated time charter 
and voyage expenses. Moreover, steep oil price is flaring up fuel costs. This, in turn, is likely to have pushed up the 
operating costs in the to-be-reported quarter. What Does the Zacks Model Say? Our proven model does not 
conclusively predict an earnings beat for Golden Ocean this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings 
ESP[3] and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, 
that is not the case here as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here[4]. 
Earnings ESP:Golden Ocean has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate Estimate is in line with the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with 
ourEarnings ESP Filter[5]. 
Zacks Rank:Golden Ocean currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Highlights of Q4 Earnings Golden Ocean's fourth-
quarter 2021 earnings (excluding a couple of cents from non-recurring items) of 99 cents per share beat the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. Total revenues of $312.9 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$284.3 million. Stocks to Consider Investors interested in the broaderTransportation[6]sector may considerRyanair 
Holdings (RYAAY) andStar Bulk CarriersSBLK[7] as these stocks possess the right combination of elements to beat 
on earnings this reporting cycle. 
Golden Ocean ( GOGL ) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?
Ryanair has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #3. RYAAY will announce thefourth-quarter fiscal 2022 
resultson May 16. 
Improving air-travel demand is serving RYAAY well. However, high fuel costs are denting Ryanair's bottom line. 
Star Bulk Carriers has an Earnings ESP of +1.77% and a Zacks Rank #2. SBLK will announce first-quarter 2022 
results on May 24. 
Improvement in travel demand is likely to have boosted Star Bulk's voyage revenues in the March quarter. 
Continued fleet expansion initiatives are also expected to have contributed to SBLK's performance in the to-be-
reported quarter. However, high fuel costs are likely to have stressed SBLK's bottom line. 
Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with theZacks Earnings Calendar[8]. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

Colourful horizons ahead for MAAS Aviation

MAAS Aviation continue to see mounting optimism in the aviation sector as they report a buoyant start to 2022. 
Chief Commercial Officer, Richard Marston, comments: "The industry is seeing strong post-pandemic growth as 
travel restrictions ease and we go back to everyday life. With more aircraft returning to the skies, the global MAAS 
teams have been busy with programmes for new and existing customers throughout the first quarter of this year. 
With the 21/22 winter painting season coming to an end, there is plenty to talk about."
Statistics from IATA back up Marston's positive outlook, with the trade association reporting that there has been 
industry-wide growth in revenue passenger-kilometres (RPKs) of 82.3% year-on-year in January 2022.
MAAS have continued to support established customers Ryanair and EasyJet with their programmes, repainting 
Ryanair's B737-800 aircraft at their new Kaunas facility this season and EasyJet's A320-family aircraft from their 
Maastricht paint bays.
"We have also been pleased to welcome some significant new clients to our paint shops this quarter" adds Tracy 
Jarman, Sales Manager Europe. "We have painted five A320s for Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling. The final 
aircraft in this current programme for Vueling will complete its makeover at our Maastricht facility later this month 
and we look forward to continuing this partnership later in the year."
Sky Alps is a relative newcomer to the scene, founded in 2020, the Italian airline operated its first flights in June 
2021. MAAS have aided in their continuing operations with the completion of fresh liveries for two of their Dash-8 
Q400 turboprops.
MAAS also partnered with Greek carrier Aegean Airlines, completing two end-of-lease repaints for an A320 and an 
A321. Corendon Airlines is another new customer, with the MRO recently refinishing two B737-800 aircraft for the 
Turkish carrier, one of which is a special 'Hull City' football club livery.
Condor's recent rebrand has grabbed the attention of the aviation industry with its bold striped liveries and MAAS 
were proud to have completed the paint jobs on the first two A321s in this programme. Jarman explains, "This 
project was top secret and had to be kept totally under wraps until the full launch of their new livery in early April, 
but this strategy paid off with the newly painted fleet making a big impact when revealed. The multi-coloured aircraft 
are designed to emulate the feelings of summer holidays, with the yellow stripes representing the sun, and blue the 
sea. Condor will be continuing to roll out more of their sensational new look over the summer season."
Colourful horizons ahead for MAAS Aviation
Despite the difficulties the pandemic brought to the industry, the general feeling now is of optimism for continued 
recovery in the sector. MAAS Aviation are pleased to be supporting their airline, lessor, MRO and OEM customers 
with their ongoing growth and bringing more colours to the sky again.

May 12, 2022( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Compulsory wearing of facemasks on flights to and within Europe is to be scrapped. 
The move, under which masks will also no longer be required at airports, was welcomed as 'a big step forward in 
the normalisation of air travel', by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa). 
The policy, announced by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, takes effect on Monday and is 
expected to boost demand for summer holidays. It is also hoped that the change will end the confusion about which 
flights require masks. 
Ryanair, which is Europe's biggest airline, said it would scrap masks on all its flights[1]. All the main British airlines, 
including BA and easyJet, have already eased mask rules on flights to the UK. However, where a destination 
requires masks, passengers are still being told to cover their faces. 
The safety agency and disease control centre are continuing to advise passengers that masks offer 'one of the best 
protections' against Covid. 
Patrick Ky, the Easa executive director, said: 'It is a relief to all of us that we are finally reaching a stage in the 
pandemic where we can start to relax the health safety measures.' 
At least 15 European countries, including Greece and Italy, still require masks on public transport, although the 
number is expected to fall rapidly, according to Eddie Wilson, Ryanair's chief executive. 
Virtually all European countries have ditched passenger locator forms, but Spain, Austria and Germany still require 
unvaccinated passengers to complete one. 
Tests for fully vaccinated passengers have all but been abolished, although some countries require a booster jab. 
The UK scrapped tests for all arrivals and discontinued its passenger locator form in March, one of the first in 
Europe to do so. 
From Monday France will drop its requirement to wear face coverings on public transport, Olivier Vran, the health 
minister has announced. 
Airlines and airports are lobbying officials in the US to drop pre-departure tests for vaccinated passengers, a move 
that would be expected to boost tourism and ease delays at airports. 
Fears of disruption at airports this summer remain after long queues were reported at Manchester and Birmingham 
airports this week, although officials insist that they are working hard to solve the problems. 
Facemasks scrapped on European flights
Speaking at the Airport Operators Association annual dinner in London on Tuesday, Karen Dee, the chief 
executive, said: 'While the majority of people will have travelled without any problem, we do acknowledge that it's 
not always been possible to deliver the kind of smooth experience that passengers have come to expect from us.' 
She insisted that airports were working 'really hard' to recruit and vet staff before the peak summer holidays, 
adding: 'While UK restrictions have thankfully fallen away, a significant proportion of our long-haul flights have not 
yet returned and, in other places, Covid-related additional checks continue prior to departure. This has been a 
contributory factor in some of the disruption in airports particularly over the Easter school holidays.' 
Heathrow announced that five million passengers travelled through its terminals in April, a 848 per cent rise on last 
year when there were tight restrictions.

Is a Surprise Coming for Ryanair ( RYAAY ) This Earnings Season?

May 12, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up 
quite nicely for their report. 
That is because Ryanair is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a 
precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date 
information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for RYAAY in this 
report. 
In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of $1.08 per share for RYAAY, 
compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11 per share. This suggests that analysts have 
very recently bumped up their estimates for RYAAY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.70% heading into 
earnings season. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price and EPS Surprise https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price-
eps-surprise?icid=chart-RYAAY-price-eps-surprise Ryanair Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise[2] | Ryanair Holdings 
PLC Quote[3] Why is this Important? A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful 
in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks 
that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the 
time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here[4]). 
Given that RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock 
ahead of earnings. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5].s 
Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Ryanair, and that a beat might 
be in the cards for the upcoming report.

"We are delighted that Ryanair has felt they can put their trust in Caerdav. As a team we take great pride in offering 
our customers a world-leading service, and to be able to demonstrate this to an airline the size of Ryanair is very 
exciting indeed - we're looking forward to welcoming the first aircraft into St. Athan."

May 10, 2022( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Boeing Co said on Tuesday it had delivered 28 of its cash cow 737 MAX single-aisle jets to customers in April, 
seizing on rebounding air travel even as the U.S. planemaker battles industrial and regulatory hurdles across its jet 
portfolio. 
Five of the 737 MAX jets Boeing handed to customers were for Irish budget carrier Ryanair, while United Parcel 
Service took its last hump-backed 747-8 and Thai Airways took three 777-300ER jets, Boeing said. 
The 35 overall deliveries in April was down from the 41 jets it handed over in March but more than double the 17 
planes in the year-ago period. 
The closely watched orders and deliveries monthly snapshot comes as Boeing struggles to overcome production 
flaws that snarled deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner for a year as well as certification risks on its forthcoming 737 MAX 
10 and 777X jets. 
On Monday, Boeing won a respite from the woes affecting its core widebody programs, when Lufthansa said it 
would buy 10 cargo planes including seven of the 777X version, also known as 777-8F. 
The carrier also boosted its order for Boeing 787s as partof a compensation deal for delays to the 777X passenger 
version. 
For April, Boeing booked 46 gross orders - including 44 for its 737 MAX from leasing companies and unidentified 
customers, and two 777 freighters, it said. 
After 34 order cancellations, including AerCap scrapping two 787-10 jets, and instances where buyers swapped jet 
models, orders for April stood at 12. 
For the year through April, Boeing booked 213 gross orders, or 157 after cancellations and conversions. After 
accounting adjustments, Boeing recorded 98 net orders for the year so far. 
Overall, Boeing's order backlog rose to 4,218 from 4,176, Boeing said.

Jail sentence handed to woman in 2021 forced Ryanair landing in Minsk
Jail sentence handed to woman in 2021 forced Ryanair landing in Minsk

One of the two people detained in Belarus last year after Minsk forced a Greece-to-Lithuania flight to land so it 
could take them into custody - an event that enraged the European Union - has been sentenced to jail for 
incitement and making threats.
Sofia Sapega was on the Ryanair flight last May when it crossed over Belarusian airspace. Authorities in Minsk 
initially forced the flight to land in Minsk after alleging there had been a bomb on board.
She was travelling with her boyfriend, Belarusian blogger Roman Protasevich, who is believed to have been the 
main target of the action. He was a key leader in 2020 protests against widely disputed elections that returned 
Alexander Lukashenko to another term as president in Belarus before fleeing the country.
Sapega's sentence was announced by human rights group Viasna. The group reported on its website that "there's 
been a harsh verdict against the political prisoner Sofia Sapega: six years of prison and a 167,500-rouble 
fine [about $50,000]."
The EU decried the incident, noticing it endangered aerial safety and interrupted a flight travelling between two 
EU countries. In its wake, the EU blocked Belarusian airlines from its airspace in the aftermath.
Sapega had been accused of incitement, urging people to conduct violence and murders and insulting government, 
police and court officials.
Protasevich's trial is under way, according to media reports. The one-time editor of a Telegram news channel has 
appeared on state TV multiple times since his detention to distance himself from his former opposition allies. Those 
close to him say he is making the statements under duress.

 A Belarusian court sentenced Sofia Sapega[1], the girlfriend of a dissident arrested after their commercial flight 
was forced to land in Belarus last year, to six years in prison on Friday for inciting social hatred, according to the 
Viasna Human Rights Center. 
The 24-year-old Russian citizen was flying with her boyfriend Roman Protasevich[2], a dissident blogger critical of 
Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, on a Ryanair flight from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, in May 
2021 when it was diverted to Minsk by Belarusian authorities. 
Belarus said at the time it had ordered the plane to land after an anonymous tip-off that there was a bomb on board. 
The bomb threat turned out to be false, and Protasevich and Sapega were immediately arrested. 
The diversion of a commercial flight to arrest the pair prompted international outrage and urged the European Union 
and United States to impose more sanctions against Belarus.

Kalnins/EPA] 
Protasevich has yet to go on trial and the status of the investigation against him is unclear. 
The blogger, who fled Belarus in 2019, had worked as an editor at the Poland-based Nexta Live channel on the 
Telegram messenger app. 
The channel, which is openly hostile to Lukashenko, played an important role in broadcasting and coordinating 
huge opposition protests in 2020[3]. 
The mass protests were sparked by anger over what the opposition said was a rigged presidential election[4] that 
gave Lukashenko his sixth term in power. 
Lukashenko denied stealing the election and cracked down hard on the opposition, whose leading members were 
jailed or forced to flee abroad.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) is ready to jump on various financing opportunities to fund its orders of 737 Max aircraft from 
Boeing (BOE.L), including secured debt or sales and leasebacks, Reuters reported Thursday. 
The airlines' chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, said the company does not plan to look into the bond market for 
the time being after it raised 1.2 billion euros ($1.27 billion) last year in a sale of five-year bonds. Ryanair is shoring 
up funding as it takes the deliveries of 150 Boeing 737 Max aircraft within the next three years.

RYANAIR yesterday announced it flew 14.2m passengers in April, marking a 91 per cent leap on 2021 figures.
With an average of 2,815 flights per day, the Dublin-based airline was the largest operator in Europe, according to 
data from international traffic management organisation
Eurocontrol.
It comes as the post-pandemic travel bounceback has been in full swing, with Wizz Air, which was ranked seventh, 
announcing this week that its April passenger numbers had risen 542 per cent.
Ryanair's passenger load factor, which measures how well an airline fills its seats, has also progressively grown, 
going up from 79 per cent in
January to 91 in April.
The robust demand comes despite Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's warnings last month that ticket prices were due 
to rise in the summer.
While fares would remain slightly lower than pre-Covid 2019 levels through to the end of May, O'Leary warned 
prices would be up between five and 10 per cent in the peak summer months.

May 05, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Spirit Airlines SAVE[1] took a vital decision to reject JetBlue Airways' JBLU[2] enhanced offer to 
get acquired by the latter. Spirit's management cited regulatory risks while rebuffing the offer. Instead, SAVE 
announced that it was sticking to the takeover bid worth $2.9-billion ($6.6 billion when the assumption of net debt 
and operating lease liabilities are considered), put forward by Frontier Group HoldingsULCC[3], the parent company 
of Frontier Airlines, in February. 
Spirit was also in the news on the earnings front as it released s first-quarter 2022 earnings report. Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT[4] too released first-quarter 2022 earnings results in the past five trading days. 
With the first-quarter earnings season underway, a plethora of airline releases was also discussed in the previous 
week's write-up[5]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.After consulting legal experts, Spirit's board of directors 
decided that the unsolicited offer worth of $33 per share in cash along with a number of deal sweeteners, received 
from JetBlue, is by no means a 'Superior Proposal' as defined in SAVE's merger agreement with Frontier. 
Per Spirit's chairman of board of directors, Mac Gardner, 'Spirit continues to believe in the strategic rationale of the 
proposed merger with Frontier and is confident that it represents the best opportunity to maximize long-term 
shareholder value. After a thorough review and extensive dialogue with JetBlue, the Board determined that the 
JetBlue proposal involves an unacceptable level of closing risk that would be assumed by Spirit stockholders. We 
believe that our pending merger with Frontier will start an exciting new chapter for Spirit and will deliver many 
benefits to Spirit shareholders, Team Members and Guests." Sprit Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 
(Sell), expects the deal with Frontier to close in the second half of 2022.

2. Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[7] load factor (percentage of seats occupied by passengers) exceeded 90% (91% to 
be exact) in April 2022. This is the first time that the reading attained an astronomical figure ever since the 
pandemic had begun in 2020. In April, Ryanair carried 14.2 million passengers, well above the 11.2 million 
headcount transported in March. The month was the second in a row wherein Ryanair carried more passengers 
than in the corresponding pre-pandemic period. In April, Ryanair operated more than 82,600 flights.

3. Spirit Airlines' loss (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.60 per share was wider than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.54 but narrower than the year-ago quarter's loss of $2.48. In first-quarter 2019 
(pre-coronavirus era), the carrier had reported earnings of 84 cents per share. 
In first-quarter 2022, operating revenues of $967.3 million increased in excess of 100% year over year. The upside 
reflects improving air-travel demand. Revenues were also higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $951.3 
million. In first-quarter 2022, passenger revenues, which accounted for the bulk of the top line (98.2%), increased 
110.9% year over year (when the impact of coronavirus on air-travel demand was severe) to $949.7 million. 
Passenger revenues were up 13.3% from the first-quarter 2019 actuals. Other revenues surged 60.6% year over 
year to $17.57 million. 
All comparisons (in %) are presented below on a year-over-year basis. 
Reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand, consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) at Spirit 
soared 57.5% in the reported quarter. To cater to this increased demand, capacity (measured in available seat 
miles) expanded to 46.9%. Load factor increased 5.1 points to 77.2% in the first quarter of 2022. Total operating 
revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) jumped 42.7% to 8.25 cents in the reported quarter. The average yield 
surged 33.1% to 10.69 cents. 
Adjusted operating expenses (excluding fuel) escalated 34.5% to $751.1 million. Average fuel cost per gallon in the 
reported quarter rose to $2.41 from $1.32 as oil prices shot up. Fuel gallons consumed skyrocketed 57.6% to 
$123.3 million, reflecting the usage of more planes to cater to upbeat air-travel demand. Adjusted cost per available 
seat miles (CASM) excluding fuel decreased 10.5% in the reported quarter, reflecting the expanded capacity. Spirit 
took the delivery of three new A320neo aircraft during first-quarter 2022. The total number of aircraft in its fleet at 
the end of the quarter was 176. SAVE expects to end 2022 with 197 planes in its fleet. It exited the quarter with 
unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and the liquidity available under the carrier's 
revolving credit facility of $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to the 
purchase of spare parts. 
SAVE expected adjusted operating expenses for the June quarter in the range of $1,335-$1,365 million. Adjusted 
pre-tax margin is expected in the -3 to -5% range. Fuel gallons consumed are expected to be $130.7 million in the 
second quarter. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated in the $3.85-$3.90 range. Effective tax rate is expected to be 
21%. Available seat miles are anticipated to increase roughly 10.5% from second-quarter 2019 actuals. 
4. Allegiant Travel reported first-quarter 2022 loss (excluding 32 cents from non-recurring items) of 12 cents per 
share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at earnings of 10 cents per share. Operating revenues of 
$500.1 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $494.7 million and increased 79.2% on a year-over-year 
basis. 
Passenger revenues, which accounted for the bulk (92.7%) of the top line, soared 80.7% on a year-over-year basis. 
The upside can be attributed to improvement in air-travel demand. Air traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles 
or RPMs) for scheduled service surged 64.2% in the quarter under review. Capacity (measured in available seat 
miles or ASMs) also increased 15.1% year over year. Load factor widened 2360 basis points to 78.9% in the 
reported quarter, as traffic surge outweighed capacity expansion.  
Operating cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, escalated 66.4% year over year to 7.12 cents. 
Average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) shot up 65.4% to $3.01 in the quarter. Total scheduled service passenger 
revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) rose 56.5% to 10.78 cents. ALGT exited the March quarter with 112 
planes in its fleet. Fleet size at the end of 2022 is expected to be 124. For second-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon 
is expected to be at $4. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the last six months.

Ryanair has released its latest traffic statistics report revealing that it carried 14.24 million passengers in April 2022, 
a 1,267% increase against 1.04 million passengers carried during the same period the previous year.
In April 2022, the Dublin-based low-cost carrier operated more than 82,600 flights with a 91% load factor, against a 
67% load factor recorded in April 2021.
Ryanair also stated that its traffic numbers between December 2021 and March 2022 had been negatively impacted 
by Omicron restrictions and disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
Ryanair recorded 9.5m passengers were carried in December 2022, with 7.0m, 8.7m and 11.2m passengers 
carried during January, February and March 2022 respectively. The airline also recorded load factors of 81%, 79% 
86% and 87% respectively during the same period.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, and its resulting airspace closures, led to the 
cancellation of up to 2,000 flights to and from Ukraine, Ryanair added.
According to March 2022 data released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global demand for air 
cargo markets has dropped to below pre-COVID-19 levels.
IATA said capacity across the cargo market remains constrained and attributed the drop in demand to the effects of 
Omicron across Asia, the Russia-Ukraine war, and a challenging operating backdrop.
For the year to March 31, 2022, Ryanair expects an annual net loss of (EURO)350-450 million ($386-$497 million) 
from a previous predicted loss in a range of (EURO)250-450 million ($276-$497 million).
The airline expected a strong bounce back in demand for Easter and summer but is having to keep ticket prices low 
to fill its aircraft, according to a previous comment made by Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary.

Heathrow boss at odds with airlines as battle over landing fees hots up; 
Airport accused of 'cynical' attempt to drive up charges with downbeat 
assessment of recovery

For a time in the spring, John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow chief executive, was mucking in on the front line, stacking X-
ray trays at security to help keep queues moving at the short-staffed airport.
Like the rest of the travel industry, the airport has roared back to life following two desperate years in which border 
restrictions stifled business.
But Holland-Kaye is already into his next fight. Britain's busiest airport - which has suffered £4bn of losses since the 
start of 2020 - has caused a rift in the travel industry by pushing for a 90 per cent rise in the landing fees it charges. 
It has enraged airlines, which have also suffered billions of dollars in losses and run up large debts during the 
pandemic.
The antipathy deepened this week when Holland-Kaye unveiled a downbeat assessment of the industry's recovery, 
warning that the surge in demand for travel this spring and summer was a "bubble" that might pop this winter.
The view contrasts with a burst of positive commentary from other parts of the industry. IAG, owner of British 
Airways, has said a "strong and sustained" recovery is under way. Holland- Kaye's comments have fuelled 
Heathrow boss at odds with airlines as battle over landing fees hots up Airport accused of 'cynical' attempt to 
drive up charges with downbeat assessment of rec....
accusations from airlines that he is talking down the recovery in order to persuade the regulator to allow Heathrow 
to increase its fees, which are charged on a per passenger basis.
Virgin Atlantic said Heathrow was putting out "cynical forecasts and conflicting statements", while the airlines trade 
body said the airport was "trying to drive up charges to support shareholder returns". Holland-Kaye said that he was 
offering an honest assessment of an uncertain future.
Heathrow does not forecast a return to profit or dividends this year.
Holland-Kaye said last week: "I think we are more realistic, and we have been throughout the pandemic ... It reflects 
the reality of the world we are living in."
The battle over fees has, on occasion, become personal.
Holland-Kaye was forced to step down from a Department for Transport recruitment panel this year following a 
backlash from airlines, which objected to his involvement as they argued over fees.
Figures including Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and former BA boss Willie Walsh have delighted in berating 
Heathrow.
To its detractors, the airport is a monopoly that abuses its position to charge some of the highest fees. To its 
supporters, it is a vital trade and economic hub that should be allowed to charge more to invest and keep pace with 
European rivals after it was briefly overtaken as the region's busiest airport during the pandemic.
Unlike many airline bosses, Holland-Kaye is not an industry lifer.
He joined Heathrow in 2009 after working in the housebuilding industry, including at Taylor Wimpey and Taylor 
Woodrow, and before that for a brewery and for LEK, a consultancy.
Holland-Kaye worked for five years in commercial and development roles at the airport before taking over as chief 
executive. This included overseeing the launch of the revamped Terminal 2, which was considerably more 
successful than the debacle when Terminal 5, the home of BA, opened 15 years ago amid chaos and technical 
failures.
The married father of two, who was paid £1.5mn in 2021, became Heathrow's boss in 2014, a position whose 
holder must navigate a string of politically and commercially sensitive issues.
Executives at Heathrow have argued that clashes with airlines over regulation and costs are inevitable.
Holland-Kaye has taken a lower-key approach than Walsh or O'Leary, although he did become the public face of 
the battle to build a third runway, which has pitted Heathrow against the communities surrounding it and local 
politicians.
A planning battle looms over the expansion, which Heathrow put back on the table this year, having methodically 
pushed through the process to secure political and legal approval.
Heathrow has long had a fractious relationship with the airline industry, particularly British Airways, its largest 
customer. But industry figures said Holland-Kaye worked well with Sean Doyle, BA chief executive, and the pair 
were in virtually daily contact during the pandemic, including joint pushes to persuade ministers to lift travel 
restrictions. They staged a photo shoot on one of Heathrow's closed runways to highlight the industry's struggles, 
along with Shai Weiss, boss of Virgin Atlantic.
The relationships Holland-Kaye has worked to build are about to be tested perhaps more than ever.
The Civil Aviation Authority will rule on how much Heathrow can charge to land at the airport later this year, and 
many industry executives expect the decision to be taken to appeal whichever way it goes.
Heathrow boss at odds with airlines as battle over landing fees hots up Airport accused of 'cynical' attempt to 
drive up charges with downbeat assessment of rec....
One industry executive said Holland-Kaye had won goodwill for his efforts to persuade the government to drop its 
travel rules, but had "smashed that all" by trying to raise fees at such a delicate moment.

Air Europa to expands with 737-800s
Air Europa to expands with 737-800s
AirFinance Journal

Air Europa is set to start its expansion phase in the second quarter of this year by offering an increase in 
destinations from its Madrid hub and by acquiring a total of 11 aircraft.
The Spanish carrier plans to operate 33 routes in Spain and Europe this year and the short- and medium-haul fleet 
will be supported by the lease of six Boeing 737-800s.
Sources confirm to Airfinance Journal that a pair of aircraft managed by Stratos will join the fleet. 
SMBC Aviation Capital is rumoured to be placing three ex-Ryanair and Ukraine International 737-800s with the 
Spanish carrier while the final aircraft is a 737-800 leased from Aircastle, that was previously operated by TUI.
The narrowbodies will be added progressively over the coming months, said Air Europa.
Air Europa's expansion will reinforce its strategic role in Madrid. Capacity for the second quarter will be 5% up on 
pre-Covid-19 levels, said the carrier.
"The data confirms a significant recovery in activity in recent months, especially in the long-haul sector. The 
increase in passenger demand has allowed the reactivation of routes from Madrid-Barajas, exceeding 2019 levels 
and once again demonstrating the importance of the company in the air corridor between Europe and America."
Throughout 2022, a total of 23 destinations will be offered in the Americas, in addition to the domestic and 
European network.
To achieve international growth plans, the carrier will also take delivery of five 787s, four of which are under a 
sublease agreement with long-haul low-cost start-up Norse Atlantic Airways. Both parties signed a term sheet 
earlier this month for two 787-8s and two 787-9s under an 18-month agreement.
Stratos was unavailable for comment. SMBC Aviation Capital could not confirm the placements at press time.

Aercap encouraged by demand recovery

Aercap's chief describes an operating environment of improving demand, increasing utilisation of assets and 
strengthening airline financial health as countries remove the last of the Covid-related travel restriction and 
welcome back travellers.
"The reopening of air travel continues to gather momentum around the world. Despite the uncertainty created by 
the war in Ukraine and higher oil prices, the demand for aircraft is strong," said Aercap's chief executive officer 
Aengus Kelly on a first-quarter earnings call.  
While there is still "quite a way to run" on a full recovery to 2019 levels, he says the only impediment to getting there 
is government intervention. "Once restrictions are scaled back, people return to the skies quickly and in large 
numbers."
This improved operating environment is giving airline chiefs confidence.
"When I speak to airline CEOs, I hear a consistent message: demand is strong enough in the US and Europe to 
pass through higher input costs."
The demand side of the industry continues to improve, with global flight traffic back to 75% of 2019 levels, with 
North America leading the charge at 24,000 daily flights. Europe also continues to improve, heading into the 
summer with 20,000 daily flights.
He references Ryanair as a "very visible example" of this improving operating environment.  
"Ryanair carried one million passengers in April 2021, but in April 2022, it carried 14.2 million passengers or a 14x 
increase."
China is the only major market where significant restrictions remain; however, he does not believe the move will be 
"long-lasting".  
"As we have seen over the past two years, they tend to shut down and reopen very quickly."
His conversations with airline CEOs in Southeast Asia have been "far more upbeat" since the 1st of April as "they 
are seeing booking surge from where they were just a couple of months ago".
Aercap encouraged by demand recovery
The says the CEOs are most focused on the logistics of reopening, particularly how to reactivate their fleets. "We 
can see clear evidence of this in the maintenance and overhaul facilities, where there is little to no capacity left for 
engine overhauls that are required to reactivate aircraft that have been stored for some time. This gives me 
confidence in the demand side for the years to come."
Tourist markets in Southeast Asia, India and Australia are open to international travel and this "bodes well for 
widebody demand" as these are "key" markets for Western Europe, he says.  
"The impact of these announcements is immediate. In just one example, Changi Airport in Singapore saw traffic 
return to 40% of 2019 levels, from just 15% in three months, as a result of this easing, and we see similar results 
elsewhere, with Asia-Pacific, x-China traffic back to 70% of 2019 levels or 16,000 daily flights."
He also notes a strengthening in demand for aircraft sales as the effects of covid-19 begin to ease. "Investors are 
very interested in owning physical assets to provide protection in a higher inflationary environment supporting both 
aircraft and engine values. "
For the fiscal year 2022, Aercap expects to generate between $6.50 and $7.00 of adjusted EPS and approximately 
$5 billion of operating cash flow, excluding the impact of the charge it has taken as a result of the war in Ukraine. 
This result is after considering the 33 million of ongoing lost monthly revenue from the former Russian customers.

Phenomenal lessor response to 50-aircraft RFP: Ryanair
Phenomenal lessor response to 50-aircraft RFP: Ryanair

Ryanair has reported huge interest in a surprise request for proposals (RFP) for up to 50 used narrowbodies.
"With the exception of the oldest aircraft, lessors are not exposed to Ryanair, which is possibly why we have seen 
such a phenomenal response to the RFP on NGs," said chief financial officer Neil Sorahan on an earnings call.
With plans to fly 225 million passengers per year within five years, Ryanair issued the RFP for up to 50 second-
hand aircraft.
Ryanair recorded 97 million passengers in its 2022 financial year, but plans 165 million in the 2023, 185 million in 
2024, 205 million in 2025 and 225 million in the 2026 financial year.
O'Leary said Ryanair is in advanced discussion with a number of lessors, and Boeing, for second-hand aircraft.
He commented: "What is important to emphasise is we don't need new aircraft to hit our 225 million passenger 
target by 2026 but we remain open and available. We are looking for aircraft opportunities to cover that period 
between 2026 and 2030. We are in the market with a proposal for second-hand Boeing and Airbus aircraft and we 
will see what comes up from those discussions."
Sorahan said the original plan for this summer was to operate a 65-unit 737-8200 fleet but Boeing managed to 
commit to an extra five deliveries.
The group is looking to add 55 or more aircraft for summer 2023 from its 210-aircraft delivery pipeline but is also 
seeking second-hand aircraft.
O'Leary commented: "The management of Boeing is facing significant challenges. We have been disappointed with 
the responses we have received over the last 12 months. We broke the negotiations on the Max 10 order last 
September. In the intervening period, what we have seen is more Boeing customers signing for Airbus aircraft. 
Boeing needs to fight back, needs to win back some of that market share.
"They still produce very good aircraft. There are challenges with aircraft deliveries and we are continuing to struggle 
to get deliveries of aircraft on time," he added.
Phenomenal lessor response to 50-aircraft RFP: Ryanair
"I think Boeing, certainly on the commercial aircraft, needs to up its game. We need to see more deliveries from 
Boeing for larger customers like Ryanair."

Ryanair cautiously optimistic after reduced loss
Ryanair cautiously optimistic after reduced loss
AirFinance Journal

Ryanair has a mixed outlook after reducing its loss by almost two-third in the financial year to 31 March 2022 to 
(EURO)355 million ($372 million).
While bookings have improved in recent weeks, the booking curve remains much closer-in than was typical (pre-
Covid) at this time of year, said the carrier.
The damaging impact of the Omicron variant, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February means that first quarter 
(April to June period) pricing continues to need stimulation, it said.    Ryanair said average fares were down 27% to 
just (EURO)27 in its financial year while ancillary revenue generated more than (EURO)22 per passenger.
The group acknowledges a pent-up demand for air travel and is cautiously optimistic that peak summer 2022 fares 
will be somewhat ahead of peak summer 2019 (pre-Covid) levels.    Unit cost per passenger (excluding fuel) fell to 
(EURO)35.    Ryanair plans to return to "modest profitability" in the 12-month period to 31 March 2023, despite 
limited first-half visibility and almost zero second-half visibility.    It plans to grow financial year 2023 traffic to 165 
million (up from 97 million in financial year 2022 and 149 million pre-Covid) and will pursue its load-active, yield-
passive strategy to achieve this growth.
While 80% of Ryanair's fuel requirements are hedged well below current spot prices of over $100 per barrel, its 
unhedged 20% will give rise to some unbudgeted cost increases, it warned.   Up to March 2022, Ryanair had taken 
delivery of 61 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft and it hopes to increase this to over 70 new aircraft for peak summer 2022 
(more than the 65 previously targeted) to facilitate recovery and growth opportunities. It plans to add 55 737-8200s 
for summer 2023.   Ryanair scheduled revenues increased 156% to (EURO)2.65 billion in the 12-month period to 
31 March 2022.   For the 12-month period to 31 March 2022, total revenues increased by over 190% to (EURO)4.8 
billion but operating costs reached (EURO)5.27 billion.    EBITDAR was (EURO)276 million and adjusted net 
debt/EBITDAR was 8.8x in financial year 2022.   Ryanair is committed to the gradual restoration of pay cuts this 
financial year. The group said it will start in July this year on a three-year restoration. It is in negotiations with cabin 
crew unions to accelerate the restoration process.
"If we get back to pre-Covid profitability in FY 2023, we will accelerate year 2 and year 3 and will restore fully the 
pay cuts," commented chief executive officer Michael O'Leary.   Zero debt goal
Ryanair cautiously optimistic after reduced loss
Long-term debt fell to (EURO)300 million during the 12-month period, to (EURO)5.1 billion. Year-end net debt fell to 
(EURO)1.45 billion (prior-year (EURO)2.28 billion), while over 90% of the group's fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft is 
unencumbered.    Ryanair plans to reduce this net debt to zero over the next two years, despite peak capital 
expenditure during that time.    At 31 March, Ryanair's cash position was (EURO)3.6 billion, up from (EURO)3.2 
billion at the end of the previous financial year.
In financial year 2022 aircraft and maintenance capital expenditure (capex) reached (EURO)1.2 billion and the 
Group is planning (EURO)2.3 billion Capex in financial year 2023. According to Sorahan, Capex will drop 
to between (EURO)2.1 billion to (EURO)2.2 billion the following year and will strike back quite significantly 
thereafter.
