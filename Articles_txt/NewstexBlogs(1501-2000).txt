Is Ryanair Stock a Buy As It Reaches New High?
Is Ryanair Stock a Buy As It Reaches New High?

Mar 19, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryanair 
RYAAY[1] surged to a new all-time high on Monday amid what has otherwise been a rough day across much of the 
market. And with no major Ryanair-related news to speak of, now is a great time to look at some of the company's 
current fundamentals and latest happenings to see why investor confidence remains sky high.Ryanair's stock price 
climbed over 1% to reach a new intraday trading high of $127.59 per shareâ€”in contrast to some of the biggest tech 
companies, including Amazon AMZN[2], Apple AAPL[3], and Facebook FB[4], which caused the broader S...00 to 
sink (also read: Why Are Tech Stocks Tumbling Today?[5]).Today's gains are also part of a much larger move that 
has seen the discount European airline power's stock price soar over 50% in the last year, including a 19% surge 
over the last 12 weeks.Recent News Ryanair released its February traffic results in early March and showed solid 
customer growth.Traffic grew 5% from the year-ago period to reach 8.6 million customers. Ryanair also reported a 
95% load factor and noted that its rolling annual traffic climbed 9% to 130 million customers.Last week, Ryanair 
announced[6] that it will add Turkey to its roster of destinations as part of a larger European expansion. 
The country, which had experienced a decline in overall tourism, has seen a recent uptick that Ryanair hopes to 
capitalize on.The discount airline company also recently rolled out a solution[7] to its German pilot issue that led to 
a brief strike late last year. This move could prove vital as Ryanair continues its push in Germany.Passenger 
numbers at the Frankfurt airport are in fact expected to climb by as much as 6%, based on a recent report[8] from 
German airport operator Fraport. Frankfurt, which is one Europe's busiest airports, is projected to see its passenger 
numbers reach a high end of 68.5 million, up from 64.5 million in 2017.The company noted that Lufthansa and 
Ryanair's expansion are expected to drive a large portion of this growth.More Fundamentals Ryanair is expected to 
see its revenues jump by more than 24% this quarter to reach $1.55 billion, based on our most recent Zacks 
Consensus Estimates. The company is also projected to see its earnings climb by 11.5% to touch $0.29 per 
share.The airline firm's full-year sales are expected to hit $8.31 billion, which would mark a nearly 14% climb. 
Looking even further down the road, Ryanair is expected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 
17.3% over the next three to five years. This extended bottom line growth projection should encourage investors as 
the company looks poised to boost profits while spending money to expand into new markets throughout 
Europe.Bottom LineRyanair is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock is trading at a 17x earnings, which is a 
slight premium compared to the rest of the 'Transportation - Airline' industry. This seems to be based on investor 
confidence for long-term growth compared to airlines such as Alaska Air ALK[9], Air France-KLM AFLYY[10], and 
Southwest LUV[11].The company's stock price might also seem a little steep as it just reached an all-time high. But 
comparatively, at its current price, Ryanair's Forward P/E looks cheap against where it stood as recently as May of 
Is Ryanair Stock a Buy As It Reaches New High?
last year.With all of that said, now might not be a bad time to scoop up Ryanair as a continued surge could be on 
the horizon.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently 
surpassed $700 billion - more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They're now bigger than Morgan 
Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new 
investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks' has just named 4 companies

reported in today's Mirror: Ryanair chief threatens to ground cheap flights to persuade voters to 'rethink' Brexit[1] 
CEO Michael O'Leary says he wants to make people realise they are 'no longer going to have cheap holidays' 
Ryanair is threatening to ground its planes to persuade voters to 'rethink' Brexit . Michael O'Leary, the budget 
airline's chief executive, said he wants to 'create an opportunity' by making people realise they are 'no longer going 
to have cheap holidays.' He told an audience of airline leaders in Brussels: 'I think it's in our interests - not for a long 
period of time - that the aircraft are grounded. 
'It's only when you get to that stage where you're going to persuade the average British voter that you were lied to 
in the entire Brexit debate. 'You were promised you could leave the EU and everything would stay the same. The 
reality is you can leave the EU, yes that's your choice, but everything will fundamentally change.' Mr O'Leary 
warned that there would be a 'real crisis' as flights between the UK and the EU are disrupted after Brexit. He said: 
'When you begin to realise that you're no longer going to have cheap holidays in Portugal or Spain or Italy, you've 
got to drive to Scotland or get a ferry to Ireland as your only holiday options, maybe we'll begin to rethink the whole 
Brexit debate. 'They were misled and I think we have to create an opportunity.' Or EasyJet's Johan 
Lundgren?EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren, who was on stage alongside Mr O'Leary, interrupted him to 
say: 'If you start grounding your planes, I'm flying.' [ 1]: https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ryanair-chief-

Feb 20, 2018( FFT.ie: http://www.fft.ie Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair has announced it is strengthening its ties to 
Shannon Airport, with two new routes to the UK being added as of this May. From May 19th, a three times weekly 
(Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays) service will commence to Liverpool, and a twice weekly (Mondays and 
Thursdays) service to Bristol will begin on May 17th. 
Ryanair has also added Tuesdays and Wednesdays to its Manchester service from Shannon, which will now run six 
days weekly. The additional services and Manchester extension will add 60,000 extra seats at Shannon this 
summer. The two new services bring to 17 the number of destinations that will be served by Ryanair from Shannon 
this year. Welcoming the announcement, Shannon Group CEO Matthew Thomas said that 2018 is going to be a 
year of growth for Shannon. 'We're gearing up very well for 2018. We've already had the announcement of 
additional transatlantic services this year, and we now have this very positive move by Ryanair for our UK schedule 
to add to the new Reus-Barcelona service Ryanair is starting in March. 'The UK is our largest market and it is 
encouraging that despite the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, we are adding new services into the UK. We look 
forward to working with Ryanair on these new services and to the region's support in making them a success.' 
Shannon Airport Managing Director, Andrew Murphy, said: 'Liverpool and Bristol are popular outbound destinations 
from Shannon but both also have an inbound opportunity for this region. Tourism Ireland's support for these 
services is very much in acknowledgement of that and their commitment will lead to additional tourists coming into 
the region and they must be commended for that.'

Feb 20, 2018( Politics.co.uk: http://www.politics.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  The usual civil service metaphor for 
Brexit is of a series of rocks. Each time you pick one up, all these horrible slimy things crawl out from under it - 
things you'd never have thought were remotely connected to Brexit. This is an article about the horrible slimy things 
under the rock named 'aviation'. European aviation is fundamentally a British success story. It's one of the best 
pieces of evidence for how Britain made the single market work for its services economy and helped make life 
better for passengers all over the continent in the process. 
But that success is now a hostage of Brexit. If the hard Brexiters in Cabinet get their way, Britain will turn back the 
clock on the last 30 years of development. This is how the system works. Aviation is governed by a series of 
treaties. The foundation text is the 1944 Chicago convention, which gave nation states sovereignty over their 
airspace. You can only fly to another country once you've signed an agreement with them. There's no WTO option 
or fallback system. You either sign a treaty or you're out in the cold. Most treaties allow you to fly to a country and 
back, or fly there with a transit stop on the way - a crucial advantage back in the days when planes could carry less 
fuel. And for a long time that was pretty much it. UK flights could go to France and then on to Germany, but they 
could only do so if they originated in Britain. Every service an airline offered had to be anchored down to the home 
country.Then the European single aviation market came along. It was a revolution. Britain, alongside allies like the 
Netherlands, convinced more protectionist states to open up their markets. Suddenly, airlines could offer services 
which were completely disconnected from their home country. Any EU airplane could fly between any two points in 
Europe it liked. Not only could a UK flight go from France to Germany without originating in the UK, it could set up 
daily services between Paris and Lyon. The consequences were immediate. Low-cost airlines like EasyJet and 
RyanAir sparked into life. Sure, they were almost gleefully uncomfortable and utilitarian, but they hammered down 
the cost of travel for millions. The UK aviation industry is now the largest in Europe and the third largest in the 
world. In 2006, it transported 268 million passengers, sustaining a million jobs, and contributing 52 billion to the 
economy and 9 billion directly to the Treasury. The EU is its single biggest destination, accounting for just over half 
of passengers. No sane British government would ever want to leave a system which has proved so demonstrably 
successful. Theresa May would almost certainly rather find a way of staying in. But aviation, like every other sector, 
is a hostage in the internal Tory psychodrama over Brexit.The single aviation market is part of the EU's legal 
spider's web. It comes under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which hard Brexiters reject, 
and has rules established and monitored by EU agencies, which hard Brexiters want to leave. The most important 
agency in aviation is the European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa). Everything you see on a plane in Europe has 
been vouched for by Easa - from the engine, to the landing gear, to the little trolley that goes up and down the aisle 
with the drinks. It's heavily influenced by the UK and France, who together provide two-thirds of all the rule-making 
Aviation cliff-edge: How Brexit is sabotaging a British success story
input on European safety regulation. If you leave it, bad things happen. All the things Easa used to take care of will 
suddenly have to be done by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). You don't even want to think about how much 
work that entails, or how many members of staff would have to be hired to do it. The level of technical complexity is 
dizzying. Ensuring that the plane itself is safe to fly requires certifying 5,000 different parts. And that is just one tiny 
part of the work that the regulator needs to do. It'll also have to monitor the training and work of any engineer 
carrying out work on any plane anywhere in the UK. It'll need to have day-to-day oversight of the work done at all 
172 maintenance, repair and overhaul sites. Even military training simulators for combat aircraft pilots will come 
under its remit.That new regulatory work would come as Britain cut itself off from its largest market. Leaving Easa 
means we'd be out the continetal system and back to the days of old-school bilateral treaties, restricted to flights to 
and fro. It would be like going back to the early 90s, but not in a fun Netflix series sort of way. Just in a really drab, 
irritating way. Most analysts expect there to be significant price rises for passengers, of somewhere between 15% 
and 30%. This sounds bleak enough as it is, but in reality it would represent victory. Because even getting to this 
point means we'd have avoided several more catastrophic short-term hazards. The first is no-deal Brexit. If talks fall 
apart, UK aviation faces disaster. No deal on Brexit means no deal on aviation - and no WTO-style arrangement to 
fall back on. Flights from the UK to Europe would have no legal foundation. Even Britain's flights to the US, which 
are currently validated by an EU treaty, would be affected. It would be chaos. If a Brexit deal is reached, the 
transition element means UK membership of Easa would be extended for another couple of years, buying a little 
more time to hammer out some kind of long-term arrangement. But the third-party problem remains. Britain's flight 
rights and safety recognition with several other countries - including the US and Canada - both come through EU 
membership. This is why the UK recently slipped out a message to world governments requesting that they 
continue to treat it as an EU member during transition. In the area of flying rights, this strategy is likely to succeed. 
No-one gains from chaos in the air and planes grounded in a key global transport hub. The problem is with safety 
agreements. The US and Canada will require detailed technical information about Britain's safety regime before 
they allow flights. Previously this was vouched for by our membership of Easa. But now, no-one knows what the UK 
is doing. British ministers will insist that there's nothing to worry about. Our safety standards on Brexit day will be 
identical to the ones we had the day before. But the USFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) isn't worried about 
today. It's worried about what we'll be like tomorrow. And it is not getting anyguarantees about what a future UK 
aviation regime will be like,because the government is lost in a civil war between those wanting to stay close to the 
EU and those wanting complete divergence.If the UK said it was staying in Easa, these third-party safety 
agreements would be simple. The nightmare comes if the UK leaves, pumps steroids into the CAA and decides to 
set up its own regulatory regime. Or worse, if it gets to the autumn without knowing which of these options it'll 
choose. By then, the Americans will need very detailed technical information about precisely the regime Britain 
intends to operate, now and in future. The chances of them getting it are slim. If there are no details forthcoming, 
the FAA will assume the worst case scenario and act accordingly. Staff will fly in and guarantee for themselves that 
everything is up to their standards. It will be hugely expensive for the UK aviation industry, which will have to pay by 
the hour for US officials to check all their processes and procedures, in over 100 UK airports and 172 maintenance 
and repair facilities. It would also be a desperately humiliating moment for a country which is used to acting as a 
global leader in aviation. It's akin to being put in special measures. That is the ugly prognosis for what lies ahead. It 
involves either the full horror story of no-deal or the still rather alarming problem of third party agreements during 
transition. And after that, there is a strong likelihood of chronic long-term decline in influence, revenue and 
passenger freedom. 'Regulatory divergence' is one of those phrases which rightly sends people to sleep. This is the 
practical reality of what it entails and what the consequences are of rejecting it. Ian Dunt is editor of Politics.co.uk

came in.State says the Boeing 737-800 airliner belonging to the Irish low-cost carrier landed safely about an hour

Feb 09, 2018( The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Eurostar is opening a 
direct high-speed train route between London and Amsterdam this spring, therail company announced 
Friday[1].Starting April 4,passengers will be able to hop on board a train at London's St. Pancras International and 
reach Amsterdam's Centraal station in justthree hours and 41 minutes[2], while traveling at a speed of about 186 
mph.The trains between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands will depart London twice a day, at 8:31 a.m. and 
5:31 p.m. They will run nonstop to Brussels, Belgium[3], in one hour and 48 minutes, shaving 17 minutes off the 
Eurostar's current travel time between these two cities. 
The route will also include a stop in the Dutch city of Rotterdam.One-way fares between the U.K. and the 
Netherlands along this route will start at about Â£35 ($48). Tickets will go on sale Feb. 20.Eurostar expects the train 
route to spark competition with airlines like easyJet and Ryanair, which offer cheap flights between London and 
Amsterdam.The company said over 4 million passengers use airlines to travel between London and Amsterdam 
every year. The market was reportedly about the same size when Eurostar launched its route between London and 
Paris in 1994.'Over the last twenty-three years, the market for travel between London and Paris has more than 
doubled as customers increasingly choose high speed rail over plane,' the company said in a statement[4]. 'As the 
Netherlands grows in popularity as a key business and tourism hub, the potential for the new service and the overall 
market is significant.'But there's one hitch in the company's current plans: The trip from London to Amsterdam will 
be direct, but passengers traveling in the opposite direction will have to change trains in Brussels to go through 
passport and security screening[5]. This is due to continuing negotiations between the U.K. and the Netherlands on 
enabling passport checks to be conducted in the Netherlands before departure.Eurostar expects an agreement will 
be in place by the end of 2019 [6]that would allow passengers to travel direct both ways. This article originally

ReleaseChicago, IL - February 6, 2018 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Airlines, including Delta 
Airlines DAL[1], American Airlines Group AAL[2], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], Southwest Airlines LUV[4] and 
United Continental Holdings UAL[5].Industry: Airlines, Part 3Link: 
https://www.zacks.com/commentary/148231/factors-that-may-get-in-the-way-of-an-airline-revival[6]There 
is 
no 
denying that stocks in the airline space are witnessing good times on the back of a number of tailwinds like 
improved unit revenues and financial prosperity. Despite the optimism, there are certain roadblocks one must be 
mindful of before investing in the sector. Let's delve into the details.Rising Fuel Costs Hurting Bottom LineFuel 
costs are on the rise lately, with oil prices crossing the $60-a-barrel threshold. This upsurge can be attributed to the 
decision of OPEC member nations and Russia to extend production cuts to the end of 2018. This upsurge, 
however, does not spell good news for carriers.As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline 
companies, the rise in oil prices naturally pushed up operating expenses, in turn, hurting the bottom line of 
carriers.In fact, in the last three months, oil prices have increased significantly. The fact that fuel costs are on the 
rise can be made out from Delta Airlines' fourth-quarter earnings report. Average fuel price (adjusted) was up 
20.9% year over year to $1.93 per gallon at this Atlanta, GA-based carrier.The scenario is unlikely to change this 
year. Delta, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects fuel prices, including taxes and refinery impact, between 
$2.05 and $2.10 per gallon in the first quarter of 2018, which is much higher than the year-ago figure. You can 
seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[7]Moreover, the International Air Transport 
Association ('IATA') projects that jet fuel prices will escalate around 12.5% to $73.80 per barrel in 2018. The fuel bill 
is likely to account for 20.5% of total costs in 2018 (18.8% in 2017).Labor-Related Issues â€” Another DragApart 
from the rise in fuel costs, the surge in labor expenses is hurting the bottom line of carriers. This is primarily due to 
deals inked by carriers with various labor groups.Evidently, the improved financial health of the carriers has not 
gone unnoticed by their employees, who are eager to get a share of the pie. This has propelled frequent new labor 
deals across the airline industry.Even in the ongoing fourth quarter of 2017, labor costs have limited the bottom-line 
growth of carriers. For example, at American Airlines Group, expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 
7%. This was primarily due to the significantly higher pay offered to pilots by the company to operate unassigned 
flights during the busy winter travel period.This followed the infamous scheduling glitch, which allowed pilots of the 
carrier to take leave during the winter holiday period, giving rise to an acute pilot shortage during the busy travel 
Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: Delta Airlines , American Airlines , Ryanair Holdings , Southwest Airlines 
and United Continental
period. The crisis was finally averted after talks between the company and its pilots' union â€” Allied Pilots 
Association.The surge in labor costs is augmented in IATA's forecast for 2018. According to the projection, 
expenses related to labor are expected to be the largest expense item for airlines this year. Labor costs are 
projected to account for 30.9% of total expenses, and total unit costs are expected to increase 4.3% (much higher 
than the 1.7% increase in 2017).Moreover, issues related to labor strife have been hurting airlines quite a bit. 
Recently, Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings' pilots resorted to a four-hour strike. This wasreportedly[8]the first time its 
pilots ever struck.Computer Glitches Hurting Airline OperationsAmerican Airlines is not the only carrier to suffer 
from a scheduling glitch.A similar issue had hurt Ryanair Holdings. According to aCNBC report[9], the carrier had to 
cancel 2,000 flights, resulting in significant customer dissatisfaction.Technical glitches, in fact, have been creating a 
nuisance for carriers. For example, in November 2017, acomputer glitch[10]disrupted operations at Southwest 
Airlines. Operations at British Airways were also crippled last year due to a major IT system failure. Since 
expenditure on technological infrastructure is significant for stocks in the airline space, their profitability might be 
hurt in the event of such malfunctions.Capacity-Related Woes ...clining AirfareWoes related to capacity 
overexpansion plagued airline stocks in the not so distant past (particularly 2015). These fears were re-ignited when 
United Continental Holdings, while releasing fourth-quarter results on Jan 23, stated that it expects 2018 capacity 
growth between 4% and 6% year over year. Moreover, similar growth in the metric is forecast for 2019 and 2020. 
Following the guidance, investors fear that similar actions might be taken by rivals, triggering a price war.Capacity 
expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid-2014, 
despite the recent resurgence. Moreover, airfares have remained low, with the metric declining in November. 
Capacity over-expansion is believed to be the primary reason for the decline in airfares. Low air fares are favorable 
for fliers but a drag on the top line of carriers due to their lesser profits.ConclusionThus the airline industry, despite 
the air of optimism surrounding it, is not bereft of headwinds. The challenges may prove to be detrimental to 
investors, especially the risk-averse ones, unless attention is paid to resolve the above issues.Check out our

Feb 05, 2018( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair has launched a 
â‚¬750m (Â£662m) share buyback and sought to reassure shareholders that it is equipped to remain Europe's biggest 
low-cost airline after caving in to a unionisation drive from pilots.Staff costs will increase by â‚¬45m this year as the 
Irish company lifts pay for its flight crews, and there may be further disruption to operations as the pilot dispute 
plays itself out, Ryanair said in a statement on Monday. The carrier pledged to remain the most competitive in 
Europe, saying extra-dense Boeing 737 Max planes will help retain that advantage, reports The Telegraph[1]. 'After 
30 years of successfully dealing directly with our people it became clear in December that a majority of pilots 
wanted to be represented by unions,' said chief executive Michael O'Leary, adding that the decision to ground 
planes in order to cope with rostering issues that triggered the spat had been a 'painful' one.Ryanair was still able to 
boost net income 12 per cent to â‚¬106min the third quarter endingDec. 
31, though Mr O'Leary said he wascautious about the final period of the year, with a chance of localised disruption 
and 'adverse PR' as remaining union deals are finalised. He said the carrier was 'fully prepared to face down any 
such disruption' to defend its cost base. Dublin-based Ryanair reiterated guidance for full-year net income between 
â‚¬1.4bnand â‚¬1.45bn, assuming an absence of labor upheaval. Analysts had predicted a third-quarter figure of 
â‚¬95.3m, based on six estimates. The share buyback will commence this month and should be completed by the 
end of October, the company said. While rival easyJettook a positive view on fares last month, Ryanair said it 
expects prices to fall at least 3 per cent in 2018, and urged extreme caution about trends over the peak summer 
months.Ryanair

Europe's largest budget airline has reported a surge in quarterly profits. The positive result came despite a flight 
cancellation crisis that had hit Ryanair after the airline had rostering problems with its pilots.Ireland's Ryanair 
reported Monday its quarterly net profits rose by 12 percent. 
It said post-tax earnings increased to â‚¬106 million ($132 million) year on year in the group's third quarter to 
December.The carrier added that passenger numbers grew by 6 percent to 30.4 million people despite the massive 
flight cancellations that had been sparked by pilot rostering problems."We are pleased to report this 12-percent 
increase in profits during a very challenging third quarter," Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said in a 
statement, speaking of a "pilot rostering failure in September."Ryanair had to cancel some 20,000 flights through 
March this year, mainly because of botched holiday scheduling for pilots.'Yes' to collective bargainingThe Irish 
airline's earnings report came just one week after it signed an agreement to recognize the British Airline Pilots' 
Association (BALPA), reversing its previous unwillingness to ink such accords with trade unions."We have 
successfully concluded our first recognition agreement with BALPA in the UK, a market which accounts for over 25 
percent of our pilots," O'Leary said.The carrier, which suffered major turbulence in recent months from aggrieved 
staff, announced earlier that its UK-based pilots had accepted pay increases of up to 20 percent.hg/aos (AFP,

Feb 05, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Global 
share markets have continued their slide, adding to last week's massive losses caused by worries about excess 
equity valuations and rising interest rates that are denting investor sentiment.About two minutes into trading on 
Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 25,235.82 â€” down 1.1 percent and continuing its fall that saw 
the blue-chip US stocks index's biggest drop in more than 18 month last Friday. The broad-based S...00 dropped 
0.9 percent just after the open to 2,738.38, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite shed 1.0 percent to 
7,169.34.After streaking to numerous records in the first three weeks of the year, US stocks last week began to pull 
back. And Friday's strong jobs report contributed to the sell-off because of the rising concern the US Federal 
Reserve will accelerate the pace of interest rate hikes this year.On Monday, the sell-off hit Asian shares, where 
nervousness that a return of inflation would spell a quick end to a decade of easy money policies convinced 
investors to pick up where Wall Street left off on Friday.In Europe too, shares nosedived, with the Stoxx 600 
benchmark index slumping 1.5 percent and hitting financial, technology and resource stocks. 
The pan-European index hit a two-month low, giving back all the gains it made in the bullish new year rally. Among 
major European equity markets, only Spain and Italy were still higher than at the turn of the year, with the UK being 
the worst performer.DAX retreatingAll sectors were in the red on Monday morning, but the sell-off hit the highest-
valued parts of the market hardest, with tech stock diving 1.6 percent.Travel and leisure stocks were among the 
worst-performing as shares in carriers Air France, easyJet, IAG and Lufthansa fell.Despite reporting rising profits, 
Ryanair fell 3.5 percent after the airline struck a cautious tone about fares and potential disruption from pilot 
unions.Germany's blue-chip DAX 30 shed 1.2 percent to 12,635 points in early trading, with analysts citing the 
strong euro and higher bond yields as the main two reasons for the renewed drop. The index is now at the lowest 
level since the end of September 2017.Higher interest rates loomingThe sell-off persisted even as bond markets 
found a measure of support, helping the US 10-year yield tick down 1,6 basis points to 2.84 percent. It had been up 
nearly 4 basis points to a high of 2.8831 percent earlier on Monday. It started the year at 2.43 percent.Jan Hatzius, 
chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note published at the weekend: "The expectation of tighter 
policy is now, at last, starting to weigh on broader financial conditions. We are not particularly concerned about the 
move so far . . . Nevertheless, it might indicate that the equity and credit markets will need some time to digest the 
recent repricing before taking the next step." Bond markets have come under rising pressure this year as economic 
sentiment has improved and central banks started to unwind some of their post-crisis monetary stimulus. A surge in 
US wages revealed in data on Friday and robust economic growth raise the possibility that the Federal Reserve 
could look to tighten monetary policy this year more aggressively than anticipated.hg/uhe/aos (Reuters, AFP, dpa)

has officially signed a deal to recognize a British pilots' union, the first recognition of a union in the history of the 
carrier. But it remains unclear whether more deals with other unions will follow.Irish budget airline Ryanair on 
Tuesday announced it would allow Britain's pilots' association to start negotiating on issues such as pay and 
holidays after the carrier recognized a trade union for the first time in its 32-year history.Europe's largest low-cost 
airline was forced last year to put the recognition of unions on the agenda in order to avoid a strike over Christmas 
after it had to cancel 20,000 flights earlier in the year due to a shortage of standby pilots."Given Ryanair's previous 
hostility toward unions, today's agreement is an historic one," said the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' 
Association (BALPA), Brian Strutton.More deals to follow?"
While we were initially skeptical about Ryanair's sincerity in offering recognition to us [] our conversations and 
meetings with them have shown that they are genuine in wanting a constructive trade union relationship," Strutton 
added.Ryanair is also negotiating with other European unions who have demanded to meet collectively with the 
carrier, saying that individual talks were unsatisfactory. The airline has so far refused those demands.BALPA itself 
said it would like to see Ryanair agreeing deals with more unions."I urge Ryanair to agree deals with pilot unions in 
other countries and with cabin crew unions," said Strutton.hg/jbh (Reuters, AFP)

Jan 19, 2018( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair has been referred 
to employment and tax authorities for investigation by two parliamentary committees, citing the airline's 'refusal to 
cooperate' with inquiries over crew pay and conditions.Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, and 
Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, have written to HMRC and the director of labour market 
enforcement asking them to investigate Ryanair and the agencies that supply its cabin crew, reports The 
Guardian[1]. Late last year, Ryanair declined to answer further questions about pay and employment practices, 
after an initial response failed to satisfy MPs. The committees sought more information after reports that cabin crew 
were required to work for free, pay for training and uniforms and take significant periods of unpaid leave, which 
suggested that agency workers were receiving less than the living wage. A letter from Ryanair's HR director, sent 
on 21 December, said crew earned between â‚¬24,000 [Â£21,150] and â‚¬40,000 [Â£35,250] a year, double the legal 
minimum for the work carried out. 
However, MPs said that the letter ignored many of their questions while the pay figures did not tally with a contract 
they had seen. Field and Reeves have told HMRC and Sir David Metcalf, the government's director of labour 
market enforcement, that despite Ryanair's assurances, it appeared that cabin crew were being paid in a confusing 
and opaque way, that could mask low pay and poor conditions. They wrote: 'We believe it is vital that potential poor 
employment practices are examined not only to ensure the rights of Ryanair cabin crew are protected, but also to 
ensure that there is no 'race to the bottom' across the aviation sector.' Field said: 'We and the public can draw our 
own conclusions about Ryanair's comprehensive failure to answer allegations on its pay and employment 
practices.' They had requested that HMRC extend its current investigation into Ryanair pilots to look at cabin crew, 
he said. Reeves said she hoped that HMRC would look at the airline's practices as a matter of urgency. 'Ryanair 
might want to dodge our committees' questions and hide behind excuses, but the UK is the largest provider of 
workers to the company and we must be sure that everyone working for Ryanair is receiving fair pay and 
reasonable working conditions.' A spokeswoman for the airline said: 'Ryanair has already confirmed to this 
committee that its pilots earn between â‚¬130,000 [Â£114,550] and â‚¬180,000 [Â£158,600] per annum and our cabin 
crew between â‚¬24,000 and â‚¬40,000, which is more than double UK national minimum wage, and since we also 
comply fully with UK employment law, we have no further comment in response to this committee's inaccurate 
press releases.' Earlier, the airline said that pilots across its 15 UK bases had voted to accept pay increases of up 
to 20 per cent, while talks continued with British pilot union Balpa over recognition. Talks with Irish unions are also 
continuing, after the airline announced last month it would reverse previous policy and recognise unions. HMRC

Jan 10, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  German 
flagship carrier Lufthansa says it has replaced Irish rival Ryanair at the top of the list of airlines with the most 
passengers in Europe. The demise of Air Berlin played no small part in this, experts noted.Germany's Lufthansa 
announced Wednesday it carried 130 million customers in 2017, edging ahead of Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair to 
become Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers.Apart from its core brand, the German group includes 
Austrian and Swiss Airlines, Brussels Airlines and no-frills Eurowings which together logged around 19-percent 
growth year on year.Lufthansa also gobbled up chunks of insolvent domestic carrier Air Berlin as part of a push to 
strengthen Eurowings. 
Lufthansa confirmed it had been able to secure a lot of extra bookings last fall when Air Berlin disappeared from the 
skies.Neck-and-neck raceRyanair reported growth of around 10 percent to 129 million passengers in 2017. The 
Irish carrier was unable to retain its crown as Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers as it had to cancel 
many flight towards the end of last year because of a shortage of pilots.Executives at Lufthansa were left fuming 
last year by the Irish carrier's arrival at it home base in Frankfurt, where airport operator Fraport agreed to charge 
the budget airlines lower fees.Lufthansa is also keeping an eagle eye on British low-cost carrier easyJet, which â€” 
after buying up other parts of Air Berlin â€” plans to operate more domestic flights in Germany.hg/aos (AFP, Reuters,

John F. Kennedy International Airport closed on Thursday, forcing many flights to reroute before arriving at the 
airport on Friday. Unlike most airports, JFK's terminals operate independently and rarely work with each other. This 
meant that many travelers had to wait on the runway for an open gate at their assigned terminal for as many as 
nine hours on Friday and Saturday, even if gates at other terminals were open.  Travelers using New York's John F. 
Kennedy International Airport have had a rough week. 
From delays and cancellations[1] to a water main that burst and flooded[2] a baggage claim area, operations at the 
airport have been a mess. But things were worse than they had to be due to the strange way the airport's terminals 
are set up. According to Jason Rabinowitz at The Points Guy[3], JFK's terminals operate independently and rarely 
work with each other. This became a huge problem when the airport closed on Thursday morning and pushed back 
its reopening time from Thursday afternoon to Friday morning. Before it delayed its reopening, dozens of flights â€” 
many of them international â€” were already flying to the airport, assuming it would be open by Thursday afternoon. 
Once they learned they wouldn't be able to land at JFK until Friday, these flights were either rerouted to other 
airports or turned back to their departure points. Their problems compounded when they tried to land at JFK on 
Friday. Since the airport had to make room for an extra day's worth of planes while operating its normal schedule, 
many Thursday flights had trouble finding open gates.  But the problem was worsened because JFK's terminals 
rarely cooperate, so each Thursday flight had to wait until a gate at its originally assigned terminal was open. This 
meant that if a flight had planned to land at Terminal 1 on Thursday, it had to wait until it could find a gate at 
Terminal 1, even if gates at other terminals were open. As a result, travelers sat on the runway for as many as nine 
hours while waiting to de-board their flights. The incident showed why JFK often ranks among America's least 
satisfying airports[4].NOW WATCH: The 5 issues to consider before trading bitcoin futures[5]See Also: These

Jan 08, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  
Germany's flag carrier is expanding rapidly after taking over a large part of the fleet of insolvent rival Air Berlin. The 
hiring spree will boost payrolls at both Lufthansa itself and its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.German airline group 
Lufthansa said Monday it planned to hire about 8,000 people in 2018, with more than half of the new employees 
being flight attendants.Some 2,500 of the new hires would go to Lufthansa proper, while 2,700 would be taking up 
jobs at Eurowings, Germany's biggest airline said. 
Read more: The changing skies of EuropeTaking into account workers leaving the company, a Lufthansa 
spokesman told AFP that the net effect of the hiring effort would be "several thousand" new jobs â€” an increase on 
the roughly 3,000 who started work last year.Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Eurowings is key to the group's 
expansion plan, as chief executive Carsten Spohr aims to challenge budget airline competitors like Irish Ryanair 
and Britain's Easyjet.German aviation market gets crowdedEasyjet last week launched Germany flights for the first 
time, seeking to profit from the bankruptcy of Air Berlin, which was once the country's second-largest airline. The 
British carrier had purchased 25 Air Berlin planes stationed at Berlin's Tegel Airport, along with the take-off and 
landing rights in mid-December, after Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August.In December, Lufthansa received the

Easyjet takes off from Berlin Tegel as it joins crowded German market
Easyjet takes off from Berlin Tegel as it joins crowded German market

Jan 05, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  The low-
cost airline has launched its first domestic flights in Germany from its new base at Berlin's Tegel Airport. The British 
carrier has added 19 new routes and joins an already crowded domestic market in Germany.Low-cost carrier 
Easyjet commenced its new domestic German service shortly after 10.30 CET on Friday morning from Berlin's 
Tegel airport, as it seeks to capitalize on Air Berlin's demise.Easyjet will add 19 destinations to its schedules from 
Tegel, with four of those within Germany â€” Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich and DÃ¼sseldorf â€” and said it aims to fly 40 
times a week between Tegel and DÃ¼sseldorf.The airline's increased focus on the German market comes after the 
Air Berlin deal and puts Easyjet in direct competition with Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings, which have been 
criticized in recent months for inflating its fares amid claims of antitrust.During the period of Air Berlin's insolvency, 
the price of some domestic fares have risen by 30 percent.Berlin baseEasyjet currently has 12 planes stationed at 
Tegel but plans to increase that figure to 25 within the next six months with aircraft purchased from Air Berlin, 
making it Easyjet's second largest base after London Gatwick, where the company has 37 aircraft.Easyjet, which 
plans to use its partner airlines for some of its Tegel flights in the initial phase of the new operation, is increasingly 
targeting business travellers by offering routes to Zurich, Vienna, Copenhagen and Stockholm. 
Record passenger levelsThe news of Easyjet's expansion in Germany comes on the same day the company 
announced a record number of passengers for 2017.Easyjet carried 81.6 million passengers last year, up 9.6 
percent from 2016, but still trails Irish rival Ryanair, which carried a record-high 129 million passengers last 
year.However, Easyjet's annual net profits slumped by almost 33 percent as a result of increased competition and a 
Brexit-fuelled drop in the pound. Easyjet applied for a new air operator's license in Austria in July 2017 in 
preparation for Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, and the associated Single European Sky system, in 
March 2019.mds/uhe (dpa, AFP)

Stocks recently featured in the blog include American Airlines Group AAL[1], Southwest Airlines LUV[2], Ryanair

Analyst Blog: Airline Stock Roundup: New Tax Law Bonuses at American, SouthwestThe New Year brought 
favorable tidings to the employees of airline heavyweights, American Airlines Group and Southwest Airlines, as the 
carriers announced bonuses worth $1,000 per member, following the tax overhaul. 
Notably, the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package signed into law by President Trump reduces corporate taxes from 
35% to 21%.European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings, also grabbed headlines when it released impressive 
traffic data for December, 2017. The carrier is benefitting from low air fares and expects it to be even lower in the 
current year.Meanwhile, issues related to passengers continued to haunt U.S. carriers. Alaska Airlines, the wholly-
owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, was the latest sufferer in this regard when it was reportedly sued by the 
family of an elderly lady. The lady died last year following a fall in an escalator at the Portland Airport, 
Oregon.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return[7](Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 27, 
2017[8]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories1. Ryanair reported a 3% year over year rise in traffic to 
9.3 million for December owing to cheap ticket prices. Another important metric, load factor (percentage of seats 
filled by passengers) improved 1% to 95% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion in the same month. In 
fact, low air fares helped the carrier record a 10% rise in 2017 traffic to 129 million.2. The tax overhaul is expected 
to aid airlines significantly. Buoyed by the new tax laws, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines declared 
bonuses for their respective employees. American Airlines will pay the amount (totaling $130 million) to each of its 
employee, excluding officers, by Mar 31, 2018. Meanwhile, Southwest will distribute the cash bonus on Jan 8.Apart 
from the huge drop in corporate tax rate, the fact that the new laws allow companies to deduct their capital 
expenditures from taxable income immediately has proved to be favorable for airlines as they will be able to invest 
toward capital expenditure considerably. As a result, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: American Airlines Group , Southwest Airlines , Ryanair Holdings, Alaska Air 
Group and United Continental Holdings
higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital 
expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. In this regard, Southwest announced that it will 
invest significantly toward fleet modernization. In fact, this low-cost carrier converted options on 40 Boeing Max 8s 
to firm orders. The company also deferred orders for 23 737 Max 7 planes of Boeing until 2023/2024.Following the 
tax overhaul, Southwest expects to record a non-cash credit in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the fourth 
quarter of 2017. Economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated in the band of $2-$2.15 in the same quarter.3. The 
family of a 75- year old lady, reportedly [9]sued Alaska Airlines and the concerned wheelchair contractor following 
her death after being injured. Apparently, she arrived in Portland after holidaying in Maui. At the airport, she slipped 
down an escalator. The family has lodged a complaint pertaining to wrongful death[10] against the concerned 
parties. Currently, Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks 
#1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[11]4. According to a Reuters [12]report, El Al Airlines of Israel intends to operate 
non-stop flights (thrice a week) connecting Tel Aviv and San Francisco by Dec 31, 2018 as part of its efforts to 
expand in North America. The carrier will utilize Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes for flights on the route. This Israel-
based carrier will compete with United Continental Holdings on the route, per the report.Today, Zacks is promoting

Jan 02, 2018( RT: For Decision Makers in Respiratory Care: http://www.rtmagazine.com Delivered by Newstex)  A 
Ryanair passenger was detained by Spanish authorities after he opened the aircraft's emergency exit while the 
plane sat on the tarmac after he complained of an asthma attack. The plane is said to have been sat on the tarmac 
for about an hour after it landed in Spain before the man opened the door. Passenger Fernando Del Valle Villalobos 
said: 'He activated the emergency door and left, saying, 'I'm going via the wing.' It was surreal.' He was ordered 
back onto the plane until Civil Guard officers arrived to question him. Raj Mistry, who sat next to the man on the 
plane, told MailOnline: 'It seems nobody noticed that the man who decided to exit the plan was suffering from 
asthma. I was talking to him throughout the flight and there was a few times he was using his inhaler. He also took 
medication 
just 
before 
the 
flight 
took 
off.'

One report said he went outside because he "needed air" during a medical episode. A passenger on a Ryanair 
flight to Spain lost patience with after his plane was held up on the tarmac, and climbed out onto the wing via the 
emergency exit. The man, who has not been named, was filmed climbing outside of the cabin after flying from 
London Stanstead to Malaga airport on New Year's Day. Footage posted on social media, and reproduced by 
Spanish newspaper Malaga Hoy, showed the man standing on the wing of the plane. According to Fernando Del 
Valle Villalobos, who recorded the footage, the flight had set off late, only for passengers to then be stuck on the 
tarmac after it landed for more than half an hour. Eventually, the passenger decided to leave under his own steam, 
opened the door and climbed out, according to Malaga Hoy. A video of the incident is below:Youtube Embed:

Jan 03, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The New Year brought 
favorable tidings to the employees of airline heavyweights, American Airlines Group AAL[1] and Southwest Airlines 
LUV[2], as the carriers announced bonuses worth $1,000 per member, following the tax overhaul. Notably, the $1.5 
trillion tax overhaul package signed into law by President Trump reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 
21%.European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], also grabbed headlines when it released impressive 
traffic data for December, 2017. The carrier is benefitting from low air fares and expects it to be even lower in the 
current year.Meanwhile, issues related to passengers continued to haunt U.S. carriers. Alaska Airlines, the wholly-
owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK[4], was the latest sufferer in this regard when it was reportedly sued by 
the family of an elderly lady. The lady died last year following a fall in an escalator at the Portland Airport, 
Oregon.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return            https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-
rank/industry/transportation-airline-246 Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return[5] (Read the last Airline 
Stock Roundup for Dec 27, 2017[6]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair reported a 3% 
year over year rise in traffic to 9.3 million for December owing to cheap ticket prices. 
Another important metric, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 1% to 95% as traffic 
growth outpaced capacity expansion in the same month. In fact, low air fares helped the carrier record a 10% rise in 
2017 traffic to 129 million.2. The tax overhaul is expected to aid airlines significantly. Buoyed by the new tax laws, 
American Airlines and Southwest Airlines declared bonuses for their respective employees. American Airlines will 
pay the amount (totaling $130 million) to each of its employee, excluding officers, by Mar 31, 2018. Meanwhile, 
Southwest will distribute the cash bonus on Jan 8.Apart from the huge drop in corporate tax rate, the fact that the 
new laws allow companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately has proved to be 
favorable for airlines as they will be able to invest toward capital expenditure considerably. As a result, their tax bills 
for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands 
of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. In this 
regard, Southwest announced that it will invest significantly toward fleet modernization. In fact, this low-cost carrier 
converted options on 40 Boeing Max 8s to firm orders. The company also deferred orders for 23 737 Max 7 planes 
of Boeing until 2023/2024.Following the tax overhaul, Southwest expects to record a non-cash credit in the range of 
$1 billion to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated in the band of $2-
$2.15 in the same quarter.3. The family of a 75- year old lady, reportedly [7]sued Alaska Airlines and the concerned 
wheelchair contractor following her death after being injured. Apparently, she arrived in Portland after holidaying in 
Airline Stock Roundup: New Tax Law Bonus for AAL LUV Employees, RYAAY in Focus
Maui. At the airport, she slipped down an escalator. The family has lodged a complaint pertaining to wrongful 
death[8] against the concerned parties. Currently, Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold). You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[9]4. According to a Reuters [10]report, El Al 
Airlines of Israel intends to operate non-stop flights (thrice a week) connecting Tel Aviv and San Francisco by Dec 
31, 2018 as part of its efforts to expand in North America. The carrier will utilize Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes for 
flights on the route. This Israel-based carrier will compete with United Continental Holdings UAL[11] on the route, 
per the report. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 
week and during the last six months. The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green over the

Dec 27, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Last week was relatively 
quiet for the airline industry. The week, which had a day less of trading owing to Christmas, saw low-cost carrier 
Spirit Airlines SAVE[1] continue with its efforts toward expanding internationally as it announced its intentions of 
adding a couple of routes from South Florida. European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] was also in 
news as it faced a pilots' strike due to issues related to pay and work conditions.Additionally, Moody's Investors 
Service, the rating services arm of Moody's Corporation, has upgraded the ratings of Latin American carrier Gol 
Linhas' GOL[3] debt, which includes the corporate family rating to B2 from Caa3. The firm upgraded GOL's ratings 
as a result of its strong operating performance on the back of an improving Brazilian economy. According to a 
Reuters [4]report, passengers in a plane operated by JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] escaped unhurt after the plane 
skidded off a taxiway in Boston after landing.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return

(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 20, 2017[7]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories1. Spirit 
Airlines announced the addition of two new international destinations from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International 
Airport. The Miramar, Florida-based carrier will begin a daily non-stop service to the JosÃ© JoaquÃ­n de Olmedo 
International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador from Mar 22, 2018 onward. Besides, it will initiate a nonstop service to 
the Cap-HaÃ¯tien International Airport, starting Apr 12, 2018. This will complement the carrier's existing service to

Ryanair, which has been witnessing labor strife for quite some time now, saw its pilots resort to a four-hour strike. 
This was reportedly [10]the first time its pilots went on strike. Operations were not disrupted significantly as a result 
of the pilots' action. Flights got delayed but not a single one was cancelled. Disruptions were limited to the token 
strike, after the Irish carrier averted the possibility of a series of strikes across Europe, after agreeing to recognize 
unions. 3. GOL Linhas, which has had an impressive 2017, received a further shot in the arm when Moody's issued 
an upgraded rating. The outlook was changed to stable. Capacity discipline, cost-cutting initiatives apart from a 
strong demand for air travel to Latin America have aided the company this year. Moody's believes that GOL will 
perform impressively next year too, driven by the tailwinds.4. Inclement weather has been disrupting operations of 
U.S. carriers of late. Extensive snowfall in Boston resulted in delays as the departure/arrival of flights at Boston's 
Logan Airport were halted on Christmas Day for about an hour due to snow-induced reduced visibility. Amid this

scenario, a JetBlue Airways plane (AirBus A320) skidded off a snow-filled taxiway at the airport. Thankfully the 
mishap, which occurred on Dec 25 night, did not result in any injuries.5. In a customer-friendly move, Delta 
Vacations, the official vacation provider at Delta Air Lines DAL[11], added six new destinations across the United 
States to its portfolio. The destinations are Asheville, N.C.; Aspen, Colo.; Panama City, Fla.; Oakland, Calif.; 
Lexington, Ky.; and Fairbanks, Alaska. Passengers can avail of a wide range of accommodations such as boutique 
hotels, country inns and beach resorts at each destination.PerformanceThe following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.   The table above shows 
that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week primarily due to the optimism surrounding the tax 
overhaul, which is expected to aid airlines significantly. However, the gains were muted in nature. Shares of JetBlue 
Airways gained the most (6.1%).Over the course of six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 2.3% on 
the back of impressive gains at Latin American carriers GOL Linhas and Copa Holdings CPA[12]. Share prices of 
the likes of Spirit Airlines and Alaska Air Group ALK[13] have declined appreciably in the period due to multiple 
headwinds.What's Next in the Airline Space?We expect December traffic reports from the likes of Delta in the

Passengers travelling with Ryanair in Germany saw little disruption from a four-hour strike called by pilots' union 
Vereinigung Cockpit, with most flights leaving as scheduled, and only some delays.Ryanair's efforts to avert its first 
ever pilots strike collapsed on Friday as pilots in Germany held a four-hour walkout although airports said there had 
been little impact on flights.At Germany's busiest travel hub, Frankfurt airport, all six scheduled Ryanair flights left 
as planned, according to the DPA news agency.Flights left mostly as planned at Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld airport also, 
where seven departures were on the board. The 6.40 am flight to Italy's Bergamo, however, was delayed by five 
hours.At the Cologne/Bonn airport in western Germany, at least one Ryanair flight to Copenhagen suffered from the 
strike action with passengers being told to expect a 10-hour delay.Read more: Under pressure, Ryanair recognizes

strike call, which had forced Ryanair to scramble to bring in pilots from abroad."The strike participation has been 
absolutely satisfactory," a union representative said. 
VC had asked Ryanair pilots to walk off the job from 0401 GMT to 0759 GMT in a battle for recognition from the 
airline whose workers have been calling for better pay and conditions across Europe.Struggle for recognitionThe 
Irish budget carrier had sought to avert a series of threatened strikes across Europe over Christmas last week by

we started small. However, there is potential for much more," union spokesman Markus Wahl said, however ruling

management style or how it handles workers' rights," VC President Ilja Schulz told reporters.Read more: Ryanair

Dec 22, 2017( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair failed to avert its first 
ever pilots strike on Friday as pilots in Germany held a four-hour walkout although airports and the Irish budget 
carrier said there had been little impact on flights. Ryanair had sought to avert a series of threatened strikes across 
Europe over Christmas by giving up its long-held opposition to recognizing unions. 
That convinced pilots in Ireland, Italy and Portugal to call off planned strikes. However, Germany's Vereinigung 
Cockpit (VC) union staged a brief walkout saying it did not believe Ryanair was serious about negotiating with 
unions. "This was a warning shot and we started small. However, there is potential for much more," union 
spokesman Markus Wahl said, ruling out further strikes until after Dec 26. The strike ran from 0401 GMT to 0759 
GMT when only 16 flights were scheduled. Ryanair, which had urged pilots to work to get passengers home for 
Christmas, said 9 of its 36 early flights from Germany were delayed. There were no cancellations and it expected to 
operate all scheduled flights on Friday. Ryanair shares were down 0.6 percent at 0941 GMT. "We are grateful to all 
of our Ryanair pilots for putting our customers first and largely ignoring this VC strike," the airline said in a 
statement. A spokesman for Berlin airports said there were no significant effects, noting that five of seven early 
flights had departed, with one delayed. Cologne/Bonn airport said two of three scheduled flights had taken off and 
the third was delayed. Frankfurt airport said four of six scheduled flights had taken off. The VC union said after a 
first meeting that it did not believe Ryanair genuinely wanted to recognize unions and said it wanted to send a 
message that their pilots were serious about industrial action. VC said Ryanair had refused to accept two members 
of a delegation that the union nominated to hold talks with management. One of the pilots was a contractor and one 
a direct employee, but Ryanair has ended both of their contracts, VC said. "This has shown us that nothing has 
changed with Ryanair's management style or how it handles workers' rights," VC President Ilja Schulz told reporters 
on Thursday. Ryanair pilots mobilized in September after the carrier announced the cancellation of around 20,000 
flights, which it blamed on a rostering problem sparked by a change in Irish regulations. Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary told Reuters this week that his offer of union recognition was genuine but that employees must understand 
it will remain a low cost airline. Negotiations with unions will continue in the new year.

Passengers flying with Ryanair from Germany on Friday morning look set to face major disruption after the VC 
union representing several of the airline's pilots called for a four-hour strike from all German airports.The union 
representing Ryanair pilots in Germany has announced that it is calling for the airline's German-based pilots to 
strike tomorrow â€” Friday, December 22 â€” from 5am to 9am (04.00 to 08:00 UTC) at all German 
airports.Vereinigung Cockpit (VC), a German pilot trade union which represents a number of Ryanair pilots in the 
country, said the "warning strike" will affect all flights operated out of German airports during that four-hour 
period.VC were in Dublin this week with a view to meeting Ryanair and avoiding industrial actionbut the VC said in 
Thursday's statement that the talks were canceled at short notice because Ryanair refused to engage with two of 
the five VC members present at the negotiations."Ryanair's public offer to conduct negotiations with VC can only be 
classified as a further publicity stunt", said Ingolf Schumacher of the VC.Read more: The changing skies of 
Europe"In the history of the VC, there has never been a case in which the collective bargaining autonomy has been 
trampled on by an employer as it is now the case with Ryanair."This makes it clear to VC that the company is not 
interested in a mutually constructive cooperation, based on trust and equality. 
Rather, Ryanair is trying to win time and attempting to delay the beginning of collective bargaining," Schumacher 
said.Ryanair has yet to comment on the VC action.Strike action averted elsewhere for nowEarlier on Thursday, the 
VC had sent a memo to its Ryanair pilots telling them to stay alert for a possible "call-for-strike" message on their 
phones later in the day.Ryanair, on the other hand, said only that it had written to the VC "on a number of 
outstanding issues arising from the meeting in Dublin yesterday" and that it had agreed to meet the VC again on 
January 5. It added that it hoped that meeting would "resolve these issues which Ryanair expects will lead to a 
collective labour agreement for Ryanair's pilots in Germany."The news comes on the same day as the trade union 
representing several Ryanair pilots and captains in Ireland confirmed that the airline now officially recognises it as 
the representative body of its pilots in Ireland.IMPACT, an umbrella union which covers several industries in Ireland, 
said in a statement: "Ryanair management has confirmed in writing that it now recognises IMPACT as the 
representative of the airline's pilots for collective bargaining purposes, with immediate effect."The union had last 
week called a strike of its Ryanair pilots in Ireland for December 20 but then the Dublin-based airline broke with its 
33-year policy of refusing to engage with unions and the strike was called off. IMPACT says the ongoing progress 
means "the danger of industrial action had receded for the present."Meetings have taken place this week between 
Ryanair and IMPACT with the next key meeting scheduled for January 3, where the aim is to agree a recognition 
agreement that will establish collective bargaining procedures.Read more: Up in the air? Ryanair's growing 
painsOnce that is agreed, IMPACT says, it intends to "move on to negotiate substantial issues around pilots' pay 
German union calls for Friday Ryanair strike
and working conditions.""This advance is good news for Ryanair pilots, passengers and shareholders," said 
IMPACT official Ashley Connolly on Thursday.aos/mm (dpa, Reuters)

Dec 15, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  With the 
threat of pilot strikes across Europe, the Irish low-cost carrier has bowed to employee pressure and says it will now 
accept unions for the first time in its three-decade history.Ryanair announced on Friday that it would recognize pilot 
unions for the first time in its 33-year history in a bid to stop a pilot strike from taking place on December 20, as well 
as other industrial action. The Dublin-based airline said it would accept the unions "as long as they establish 
committees of Ryanair pilots... as Ryanair will not engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines".The move 
comes after pilots in several countries earlier this week threatened strike action in the busy run-up to Christmas. 
In particular pilots and ground crew in Italy were due to take action with a four-hour strike later on Friday, to be 
followed by a 24-hour walkout by pilots in Ireland and Portugal on December 20.Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary's refusal to recognize unions was at the heart of the ultra low-cost model he developed to turn a small Irish 
regional airline into Europe's largest carrier by passenger numbers, so Friday's announcement represents one the 
biggest policy shifts in the airline's history.An early ChristmasThe Irish carrier said it would hold talks with unions in 
Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal to recognize them as long as they established a committee 
made up solely of Ryanair pilots, "as Ryanair will not engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or 
elsewhere."Read more: The changing skies of Europe"Christmas flights are very important to our customers and 
we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may be disrupted by pilot industrial action," Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement."Recognizing unions will be a significant change for Ryanair, but we 
have delivered radical change before," O'Leary said in a statement. "We hope and expect that these structures can 
and will be agreed with our pilots early in the New Year."In a holding patternThe planned industrial action comes 
after Ryanair said in September that it had to cancel 20,000 individual flights which it blamed on a lack of standby 
pilots due to a failure in its rostering following a rule change by Irish regulators. Many industry observers said the 
cancellations resulted from a basic lack of pilots.Despite such difficulties, the airline thinks costs would increase as 
a result of unionization and last month said it still expected to deliver annual profit after tax of â‚¬1.4-1.45 billion 
($1.65-1.71 billion).The airline is also seeking to capitalize from the recent collapse of smaller competitors in an 
oversupplied market. Austrian carrier Niki ceased operations on Wednesday after its owner Air Berlin went bankrupt 
in August. Short-haul British carrier Monarch Airlines declared bankruptcy in October.tr/aos (Reuters, AFP)

Budget carrier Ryanair is reversing its longstanding refusal to recognize pilots' unions in a bid to avert strikes over 
the busy Christmas season. Chief executive Michael O'Leary says the airline wants to ease customers' concerns 
'that they may be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week.'Ryanair pilots in Ireland and Germany have both 
voted to take industrial action over the holiday season in disputes over pay and conditions. Italian and Portuguese 
pilot unions have also threatened strikes in the coming days. The airline said earlier this week that it would not deal 
with or recognize the unions. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]But O'Leary said Friday 
that if the best way to avoid strikes 'is to talk to our pilots through a recognized union process, then we are prepared 
to do so.' [ 1]:            https://www.seattletimes.com/subscribe/signup-offers/?subsource=promo

Dec 14, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Airlines 
are going out of business but the current consolidation in European aviation is "long overdue" say experts. More 
change is coming but overall, things look good for consumers as competition stays fierce.A walk through the old 
departures lounge at the long-since closed down Berlin Tempelhof airport is to be reminded of the ever changing 
nature of European skies.Behind the old check-in desks â€” like the rest of the terminal building, barely changed 
since the airport ceased operations several years ago â€” are the insignias of airlines you've probably never heard 
of. Most of them no longer take off; they have either disappeared altogether, been rebranded into something else or 
have been swallowed up and subsumed within some larger power.This year has seen plenty more European 
airlines slip behind the clouds. 
Austrian airline Niki has become the latest to file for bankruptcy, collateral damage in the wider Air Berlin collapse. 
Italian flag carrier Alitalia filed for bankruptcy in May while low-cost British airline Monarch went out of business in 
October, stranding passengers in holiday destinations all over the world.Fighting spirit in the sky Aviation is a 
monumental, mega-bucks business and when an airline goes bust, the bigger beasts quickly circle in the battle for 
planes, coveted landing slots, ground operations and other prized aviation assets.Read more: Opinion: Air Berlin's 
fall to earthThis year, Lufthansa, Ryanair and easyJet (numbers one, two and five in the list of Europe's largest 
airline groups by passengers carried) were primed early on to pick up most of the assets of their fallen 
competitors.European antitrust regulators were on guard though â€” their objections have reportedly scuttled the 
Lufthansa-Niki deal and they may yet present a surprise decision next week on Lufthansa's partial takeover of Air 
Berlin.Ryanair's own grand ambitions have been beset by problems closer to home. Staffing issues led to hundreds 
of thousands of flights being cancelled in September and now the airline is facing a pilot strike on December 20.The 
fact that Ryanair itself puts the latest reports of industrial activity down to "more PR activity by the Lufthansa pilots 
group" points to the level of mutual distrust that currently exists between the two biggest airlines in 
Europe.Fragmentation and competitionSo what's causing all this turbulence? Andreas Spaeth, an international 
aviation expert, believes we are witnessing a long overdue consolidation within European aviation. He believes that 
many of the airlines now going out of business would have done so much earlier, had they not been propped up 
either by their own state or by larger airlines."It was always clear that there were too many players in the market 
and that there was a need for consolidation so in a way it is not surprising that this is coming," he told DW.Citing the 
examples of Alitalia, kept in business by the Italian state for several years despite performing poorly, and Air Berlin, 
which was in trouble as soon as Etihad Airlines stopped funding it this year, Spaeth saw their continued presence in 
an already crowded market as unrealistic."They were not allowed to die, and that was not a good thing," he 
said.The European aviation market has traditionally been far more fragmented than other global aviation markets 
The changing skies of Europe
but competition in the continent's short-haul trade has been intensified recently by lower fuel prices and the 
increasing influence of low-cost airlines.As recently as 2002, low-cost airlines accounted for just nine percent of the 
European market share. In 2017, it was up to 43 percent, according to figures from OAG, an air travel intelligence 
company.Flying longer, for lessThis has all put added pressure on airlines that were already struggling and with 
low-cost giants such as Ryanair and easyJet, as well as Lufthansa subsidiary Eurowings, battling for dominance in 
the short-haul sector, it is inevitable that some airlines have and will continue to fall to earth.Read more: Easyjet 
profits fall sharply after 'difficult year'Yet there remains a long way to go before European skies are as consolidated 
as American ones. According to OAG, the top six airlines in Western Europe still only account for 43 per cent of the 
overall market, compared with the 90 per cent share the top six US airlines have across the Atlantic.Therefore, 
more consolidation looks likely, which in turn â€” logic might suggest â€” could lead to higher prices for customers. 
However, Spaeth does not see this happening.He believes competition will continue to be intense in the European 
short-haul market and he also highlights the growing influx of long-haul low-cost carriers, such as Norwegian 
Airlines, Eurowings and Level (part of IAG)."The big question was: will the big legacy carriers be able to fence off 
their core long-haul markets from big competition, but now it turns out they are not," he said."There is new 
competition even on these so far lucrative long-haul markets â€” with low cost long-haul really becoming an 
everyday thing."Feeding the big beastsAnother important dimension, according to Spaeth, is an increasing 
"segmentation" of the industry, namely a split between those offering long-haul and short-haul services.Airlines 
such as Lufthansa and British Airways are increasingly focusing on long-haul routes and Spaeth believes it is 
possible that, even allowing for the current tensions, short-haul airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet could in the 
future strike "feeder role" deals with airlines such as Lufthansa to fly passengers to the long-haul route hubs."This 
would have been unthinkable even five years ago, but now there are official talks between Ryanair and Lufthansa 
and between easyJet and Lufthansa," he said."These big low-cost carriers with a very big European large network 
might step in and fulfill this feeder role which is essential for the mainline carriers to bring people to their long-haul 
flight."It all suggests that while more turbulence is likely in the short term in European aviation, calmer skies are not 
that far away.

Pic: Julien Biaugeaud.Tourism Ireland in France has launched its marketing plans for 2018, at an event in Paris 
attended by French tour operators, travel agents and travel journalists. Irish Ambassador to France, Patricia 
O'Brien, addressed the guests attending the launch. France is one of the top four markets for tourism to the island 
of Ireland and 2017 was the fifth record-breaking year in a row for French visitors to Ireland. By the end of 2017, it is 
estimated that around 544,000 French visitors will have travelled to Ireland, up 4% on last year. In 2018, Tourism 
Ireland aims to grow French visitor numbers by an additional 5%. A major opportunity for growth comes from the 
introduction of the new Irish Ferries cruise ferry, the WB Yeats, in July 2018 - which will mean double the current 
number of sailings between France and Ireland, with daily departures in alternate directions. As well, Tourism 
Ireland will undertake a programme of promotions during the year, including a major TV advertising campaign to 
kick off in early February, reaching up to 20m potential French holidaymakers. The campaign will be supported by 
digital advertising and co-operative activity with partners such as Irish Ferries, Aer Lingus, Brittany Ferries, Ryanair, 
easyJet and Transavia. Tourism Ireland will also ramp up its publicity programme in France, placing increased 
focus on digital channels and working more closely with online media, including bloggers. French tour operators 
and travel agents, as well as business tourism buyers, will be targeted through sales blitzes, workshops, 
familiarisation visits to Ireland and a presence at IFTM (International French Travel Market) in Paris. '2017 was the 
best year ever for French visitor numbers to the island of Ireland,' said Monica MacLaverty, Tourism Ireland's 
Manager for Southern Europe. 'We are excited about the opportunities the new Irish Ferries cruise ferry will bring to 
grow tourist numbers from France. We look forward to working closely with Irish Ferries and all of our tourism 
partners - at home and in France - to keep the momentum going and build on the growth of the past few years.'

on Google+ Share on LinkedInRyanair faces the prospect industrial action during the Christmas season. Ryanair 
pilots in Ireland and Germany have joined their colleagues in Italy and Portugal and are calling for industrial action. 
Italian pilots go on strike on December 15.  The Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) union recommended on 
Monday a strike on December 20, the BBC reports. IALPA represents 79 Ryanair pilots. The German pilots' union 
(VC) is also considering a strike December 23-26, DW reports. Last week, pilots in Italy and Portugal took a similar 
decision. Unions do appear to be in a strong negotiating position. On the on hand the company finds it increasingly 
hard to recruit and retain pilots. On the other hand, the threat of strike action over Christmas undermines the 
brand's reliability, especially since the company suffered major disruptions of service at the end of the summer 
season (Sept. 2017). Since September, the company has announced the cancelation of 20,000 flights affecting 
700,000 passengers this winter, CNBC reports. Strike action would add to these cancellations. One of the demands 
put forward by pilot unions is that Ryanair agrees to engage in collective bargaining. Since this summer several 
pilots have joined unions although Ryanair does not regard any union as a legal representative of the interests of its 
pilots. However, the emergence of the pan-European Employee Representative Council (EERC) could add to the 
pressure on the Irish company to comply with a tradition of collective bargaining. Share on Facebook Share on

Dec 12, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  It has 
been a difficult few months for Ryanair. First the airline had to cancel thousands of flights and now it is facing the 
threat of strikes after some of its pilots across Europe voted to take action.Ryanair pilots in Germany have joined 
counterparts from Ireland, Italy and Portugal in voting to take some form of industrial action in the near 
future.Vereinigung Cockpit, the German pilots union that represents several Ryanair pilots based in Germany, 
announced the decision on Tuesday, although it is not yet clear when industrial action would take place or indeed, 
precisely what form it will take.Read more: Berlin airport plans "soft launch" without main terminal buildingIn a 
statement, the Vereinigung Cockpit union said: "This is intended to enforce collective bargaining to regulate fair 
working and remuneration conditions for Ryanair pilots."Vereinigung Cockpit president Ilja Schulz said: "We want to 
agree contracts with Ryanair. 
We see no other way". Any plans to strike would not take effect during the December 23-26 Christmas holiday 
period, the union added.On Monday, the Ialpa trade union in Ireland, which represents several Ryanair captains 
based in Dublin, voted overwhelmingly for some form of industrial action to take place.Pilots in Italy and Portugal 
also voted for similar action over the past week.The votes do not necessarily mean that strikes and cancellations 
are imminent, but some form of industrial action now looks very likely in Ireland, Germany and elsewhere.A meeting 
of an umbrella union in Dublin later on Tuesday is expected to confirm details of what form of action will take place, 
with several Ryanair pilots based in other European countries likely to take their lead from that.Flying through the 
stormIt has been a chaotic few months for the Irish airline. A mass of flight cancellations announced in September 
caused travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of passengers and pointed towards serious underlying industrial 
relations issues within the airline.Ryanair has steadfastly refused to engage with unions over the years, but 
relations between the airline and its staff â€” particularly pilots â€” have become increasingly strained. In the end 
rostering issues combined with what is believed to have been a significant shortage of available pilots is believed to 
have the main cause of the mass cancellations.Read more: Unfair competition: the battle between high-spreed rail 
and low-cost airlinesSince then, an increasing number of Ryanair pilots have been seeking collective bargaining 
power rights. So far, Ryanair has refused to engage in any collective union negotiations, but the growing possibility 
of strikes â€” something the airline has studiously avoided in its 33-year history â€” may force its hand.It is almost one 
year since Ryanair pilots based in Germany formed a "company council" as part of the Vereinigung Cockpit union to 
represent their interests in Germany.aos/tr (Reuters, dpa)

on Google+ Share on LinkedInThis December Ryanair will face its first strike as Italian and Portuguese pilots are 
demanding the right to unionize. The strike will begin on December 15. Pilots from Ireland, Spain, Germany, 
Sweden, and the Netherlands are also considering action. The main demand is the right for collective bargaining 
outside the framework of Ryanair's own employee representative committees. However, Italian pilots have also 
raised concerns over social security and health care. The Irish company has been shedding pilots to other 
companies. A general shortage of pilots has meant that pilots seek better employment conditions in a company that 
is notorious for its working conditions. A recent failure of the company to plan pilot's leaves of absence has meant 
the company needed to cancel over 20,000 flight. In a brief statement to Bloomberg on Wednesday, Ryanair's 
spokesman Robin Kiely said the company expected the strike to be called off. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter

Dec 05, 2017( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  As we approach the 
festive season and 2017 draws towards a close, the question of holidays, seasonal illness and increased absence 
rates once again rears its head.As we saw recently with Ryanair, failure to properly schedule employee holidays 
and manage absences can cause chaos and put extra demands on your business. ELAS employment law 
consultant Daxa Shah explains how best to manage staffing issues at this time of year: 'The festive period is one of 
the busiest times of year for most businesses and it's important to manage staffing properly in order to avoid 
problems. As the weather gets colder and workloads increase, employees can find themselves feeling stressed, low 
on energy and run down, making them more susceptible to seasonal ailments such as cough, cold and flu. 
'Scheduling staff at this time of year can be a logistical nightmare due to unplanned illness and the increased 
number of employees asking for time off to go away with the family, or simply use up their allocated holiday time 
before it runs out. 'When it comes to Christmas bank holidays and annual leave, these should be factored in at the 
start of the year. Employees' rights to paid annual leave on public holidays should be clearly stated in the terms of 
the employment contracts and are, generally, counted as part of statutory annual leave allotment. Your annual 
leave policy will give guidance for booking time off. You may want to be a bit more flexible when allowing annual 
leave during this period, however, as it is the busiest time of the year it's important to come to an agreement and 
plan as early as possible in order to avoid any surprises. 'As we get closer to Christmas, it's important that you let 
your employees know in plenty of time whether or not their annual leave has been granted or if they will be 
expected to work. Schedules should be made in advance if possible so that both you and they can make plans. 
'Christmas is a prime time for workplace absences[1] and the temptation to pull a sickie can be high. Usual sickness 
policies apply during this time and should be implemented fairly and consistently for all employees. Attendance 
should be monitored carefully and any unauthorised or high levels of sickness or late attendance should be dealt 
with as per your usual policies, which could result in disciplinary action. 'Don't forget to make sure employees are 
aware that any unauthorised absence the day after the work Christmas party will raise a red flag. There is no legal 
right to take paid leave, it all depends on the terms of a worker's contract and they should know that there may be 
suspicion pertaining to absences the day after a party. You should let employees know that if they are off sick and 
not able to produce medical evidence of any sickness, then disciplinary action may be taken. 'It's a good idea to 
keep tabs on your employees' wellbeing generally throughout the year in terms of managing their workloads and 
pressures of the job. This will allow you to identify any repeated absences that accumulate, allowing you to find out 
the reasons behind any absences and put measures in place to address them via informal meetings and welfare 
meetings, where employees are encouraged to be open and honest. Ensure that all your staff are offered the flu 
Managing festive absences
vaccine, especially if they work in sectors that involve close contact with children, the elderly or the vulnerable. You 
should also be aware of presenteeism - sometimes it is better to allow employees to be off for a prescribed amount 
of time rather than spreading a sickness bug around the workplace and putting further strain on the remaining 
employees.' Managing festive absences[2] [ 1]: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/in-business/motivate-staff-following-

content/uploads/2017/12/tourismireland2018.jpgTourism Ireland has revealed details of its marketing plans to 
promote the island of Ireland overseas in 2018, at an event attended by tourism industry leaders from around the 
country. 
2017 is set to be another record year for Irish tourism, surpassing all previous records. By year end, 10.65m people 
will have visited the island of Ireland, spending â‚¬5.78bn. For 2018, Tourism Ireland aims to build on this year's 
performance - growing overseas tourism revenue by 5% to â‚¬6bn, and increasing visitor numbers by 2% to 10.8m. 
Latest estimates indicate that, by year end, revenue generated by international visitors will be around â‚¬5.78bn, a 
6.7% increase over last year, helping to sustain some 282,000 valuable jobs in communities across the island. 
Some 10.65m people will have visited the island of Ireland, representing a 3.2% increase over 2016, with growth 
recorded from all markets except Britain. Tourism Ireland has again acknowledged that Brexit will continue to 
impact on British consumer confidence and, in turn, on outbound travel from Britain. The depreciation of sterling 
against the euro means that value for money will continue to be a key message from Tourism Ireland. New access 
developments for 2018 include a new Cathay Pacific flight to Dublin from Hong Kong; Aer Lingus flights to Dublin 
from Seattle and Philadelphia; Air Canada services between Toronto and Shannon and between Montreal and 
Dublin; as well as increased Ryanair services from Germany. Irish Ferries will introduce its new cruise ferry, the WB 
Yeats, in July - which will mean double the current number of sailings between France and Ireland, with daily 
departures in alternate directions. Tourism Ireland is also working on developing a new global advertising 
campaign, to refresh and reinvigorate the presentation of Ireland, for roll-out in 2019 and beyond. This will include a 
refresh of Ireland.com. 'We are heading into 2018 in a position of some strength, based on the success of 2017. 
Our aim is to position Ireland as a year-round, 'must visit' destination and to ensure that the contribution of overseas 
tourism to the economy continues to expand,' said Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland.

Nov 30, 2017( BioMedReports: http://biomedreports.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; Summary Low-cost carriers 
(LCCs) have gradually evolved to become a popular alternative to full-service airlines over the last 10-15 years, 
where price has become a critical factor in determining the carriers. According to Euro Control, the low-cost airline 
has been the fastest-growing segment in Europe, with the number of low-cost flights growing by 61% in the last 10 
years (2007-2016).Growth in the low-cost carrier was also characterized by a decline of 10% in the traditional 
scheduled flight segment during the same period in Europe. LCC's also holds an estimated share of 30% in the 
overall US airline market, primarily dominated by major airlines such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways. 
The increase in flight capacity reinforces the fact that low cost traffic has significantly increased in the last decade, 
which is expected to continue in the forecast period.In 2016, EasyJet revealed plans to trial the use of hydrogen fuel 
cells on its planes. The concept has been conceived to convert its entire fleet of ordinary planes into hybrids without 
the need to purchase any new aircraft. These aircraft could have the potential to save 50,000 tons of fuel and at the 
same time prevent CO2 emissions each year. The concept relies on the use of hydrogen fuel cells, which would be 
stored in the aircraft and allows a plane to move to and from the runway without using any fuel. There were 21 low-
cost airlines in Southeast Asia in 2016, operating with approximately 600 aircraft, and there has been a significant 
degree of strategic agreements (e.g. Value Alliance) and partnership activity in the region, which helped to increase 
the growth opportunities of LCC in the region.The report "Global Low Cost Airlines to 2021", provides a thorough 
insight into global low cost airlines market. The report shades light into the key trends and issues. It offers key 
insights at regional level and major country level markets analyzing the number of seats available and seats sold, 
load factor, average revenue per passenger, total revenues, revenue generating passenger kilometers and

Aviation Corporation, Air Arabia (Maroc) Scope - The widespread adoption of ticketless travel along with increasing 
internet distribution and bandwidth has been a huge boon for the entire LCC segment, especially in the developing 
countries. The advent of internet connectivity has helped to reduce the need for complex and expensive ticketing 
systems, which were previously used by legacy airlines to manage their complicated pricing structures, and 
decrease their over-reliance on travel agents to sell the tickets. The emergence of the internet as a primary medium 
in the last few years for booking tickets has greatly increased the transparency of ticket pricing, and has worked to 
the LCCs' advantage because of their lower ticket prices. It is further expected to augment the market for LCC, 
especially in the untapped and less developing markets (such as Seychelles, Mauritius, Ethiopia, and Argentina) 
where there is significant potential of market entry for LCC, with a gradual increase in the disposable income of

these countries. - LCCs in the region typically used to fly short-haul routes so that they could return to their home 
base at night, and avoid hangar and other allied costs. However, the strategies have been changing; low-cost 
airline LEVEL (from the IAG Group) has started long-haul flights from Barcelona to North and South America to 
attract customers from the traditional full service airlines (where there is significant demand for long-haul fights). In 
addition, traditional full service carriers are unbundling their offers and selling food, seat choice, and checked 
baggage separately to reduce the basic airfare cost, which will help to withstand the competition in the LCC 
segment. Reasons to buy - Take strategic business decisions using historic and forecast market data related to the

Black Friday 2017 deals from airlines make cheap flights a reality
Black Friday 2017 deals from airlines make cheap flights a reality

Nov 23, 2017( Boy Genius Report: http://bgr.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Black Friday is normally a shopping 
holiday for gadgets, TVs, kitchen appliances, and basically anything else you can pile into a shopping cart at 
Walmart. But nearly everyone who sells anything is getting in on the action this year, and that includes airlines. 
The best deals include one-way flights to Europe for $99, roundtrip flights to European vacation destinations for 
$559, and deals on flight and hotel packages. It's not just the budget airlines getting in on the deals. Sure, Iceland's 
WOW Air is responsible for the $99 one-way fares to Europe, but Delta and Southwest also have deals going on. 
Some of the best spotted by Business Insider[1] include 1,250 seats being sold for $99 for one-way trips from 
Boston, Chicago, and Pittsburgh to Reykjavik, Amsterdam, London, or Ireland; and $129 one-way trips fro LA, San 
Fransisco, and Miami to the same destinations. The deal is only valid if you buy another one-way ticket back at the 
same time, but those can be as cheap as $150. Ryanair, the notorious European discount airline, is having a sale 
on fares for as low as $6.50. Flights from London Stanstead go to destinations like Denmark, Norway, Poland, 
Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. However, one fare-checking website suggests that Black Friday might 
not be the best time to get cheap fares. Instead, it says you should wait until the Tuesday after â€” dubbed Travel 
Deal Tuesday â€” for the best deals. 'We analyzed our historical flight pricing data and found that fare sale activity 
significantly spikes on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving,' a blog post says. 'The airlines offer major discounts 
because travel demand tends to die down following Thanksgiving. Most travelers have already booked their holiday 
airfare, but haven't started planning their winter getaways yet.' [ 1]: http://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-

Easyjet profits fall sharply after 'difficult year'
Easyjet profits fall sharply after 'difficult year'

Nov 21, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Aviation 
watchers will know it has been a challenging year in European skies. UK airline easyJet has felt the squeeze like 
many of its rivals. Yet it's bullish about the future despite a sharp fall in profits.British budget carrier easyJet 
reported a fall in profits of more than 30 percent on Tuesday, with a sharp decline in the value of the pound 
accounting for a considerable increase in jet fuel costs.In their financial report for the year ending September 30, 
easyjet reported that despite an 8-percent increase in revenues past the Â£5-billion ($6.6-billion, â‚¬5.6-billion) mark, 
total profits after tax fell by 30.2 percent from Â£437 million in 2016 to Â£305 million in 2017.Nonetheless, easyJet â€” 
Europe's second largest budget carrier after Irish airline Ryanair â€” sounded positive tones on release of the 
financial statement, hailing a "robust performance" and highlighting "positive revenue trends" for the first quarter of 
the new year on the back of the travails of some competitors."easyJet delivered a robust performance during a 
difficult year for the aviation industry, flying a record 80 million passengers at our highest ever annual load factor of 
92.6 percent whilst growing capacity by 8.5 percent and revenues by over 8.1 percent to more than Â£5 billion," said 
outgoing CEO Carolyn McCall in the statement.Flying in the face of difficulties?
It certainly has been a difficult year in aviation. Rising jet fuel prices â€” exacerbated for a British carrier like easyJet, 
due to Brexit-influenced falls in the pound against the dollar â€” have forced three major European airlines, Air 
Berlin, Alitalia and Monarch, out of business in the last six months. Competition has been intense, with falling ticket 
prices a feature of European skies throughout 2017.easyJet specifically cited the fall of these rivals in their upbeat 
outlook for the year ahead, noting the potential benefits they will accrue themselves from the acquisition of the 
assets of these rivals, most significantly Air Berlin.Last month, easyJet announced it had acquired a significant 
chunk of Air Berlin's operations at Berlin Tegel airport for â‚¬40 million ($46.9 million). While the deal is set to be fully 
confirmed, it will establish easyJet as the leading short-haul airline in the German capital.Nonetheless, Tuesday's 
statement also reported that easyJet expects losses of around Â£60 million on its Tegel operations in 2018, as it 
adjusts to taking over various strands of the Air Berlin business, including the leasing of 25 aircraft, the taking over 
of slots and the hiring of 1,000 Air Berlin staff.New CEO on the wayeasyJet's optimism in the face of the fall in 
profits may in part be driven by the steps it has taken to stave off some of its Brexit-related concerns. The airline 
has formed a new base in Austria, so it can continue flying unimpeded throughout the EU regardless of the details 
of the final agreement between the UK and the EU.The airline also put a positive spin on the benefits of its own 
business model. "easyJet's model is resilient and sustainable and we now have a huge amount of positive 
momentum which will enable the airline to continue to grow profitably," said McCall, who was delivering her final set 
of results at the helm.She will leave easyJet at the end of 2017 to take over as the new head of British TV station 
Easyjet profits fall sharply after 'difficult year'
ITV. She will be replaced at easyJet by Johan Lundgren, who previously headed the German tourism multinational

Nov 20, 2017( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  British Airways British 
Airways will begin to board passengers according to their ticket price on December 12. Passengers with the most 
expensive tickets will board first and those with the least expensive tickets will board last. The airline is being 
accused of promoting a class-based system of customer service. British Airways has been no stranger to 
controversy over the past few months. 
From reports of passengers facing bedbugs[1] and urine-soaked[2] seats to an evacuated plane[3] and IT glitch[4], 
the airline has struggled to regain favor with some of its customers. It appears a new boarding policy won't help. 
The airline announced on Monday that it will begin to board passengers according to the price of their ticket, with 
the highest-paying customers boarding first and the lowest-paying boarding last. While this price-based boarding 
system is common among U.S. airlines, it has yet to gain traction in Europe. Critics accused British Airways of 
promoting a class-based system of customer service, with the wealthiest customers getting preferential 
treatment.British Airways responded by saying the new policy was designed to streamline the boarding process. 
"We are always looking at ways to improve and simplify the airport experience for our customers... Next month we 
are introducing new boarding procedures to speed up the process and make it simpler for customers to 
understand," the company told the BBC[5] through a spokesman. "This method has been used by airlines around 
the world for a number of years, including by our partners American Airlines, Iberia and Qatar."NOW WATCH: How

Nov 15, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Here at Zacks, we try to 
focus on our most tried and true financial metrics to help investors identify winning stocks. And of all the vital stock 
picking information that we suggest, we try to highlight the importance of earnings estimate revisions.With that said, 
we also understand that investors like to test the stock picking waters in a multitude of fashions, including the 
search for international companies on the rise.As many investors are not as informed about companies that operate 
outside of the U.S., we strive to provide you some insights into international firmsâ€”especially when they see their 
stock prices pop.Now, let's take a look at three international companies that soared today.YY Inc. YY[1]One day 
after YY Inc. 
reported third-quarter profits of $95.6 million, investors seem to be more confident than ever, helping its shares soar 
nearly 24.83% today. YY Inc. also crushed revenue projections and posted massive year-over-year sales growth. 
Shares of this Chinese social communication platform, which allows users to communicate via voice, text, and 
video, had already skyrocketed 126% in 2017. With today's jump, YY Inc. shares hit a new all-time intraday trading 
high of $111.52 per share.Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2]Shares of the low-cost Dublin-based airline carrier 
jumped over 2.20% today to hit $115.12 per share. Ryanair's recent Q3 profits rose, despite setbacks that caused 
the cancellation of thousands of flights, which helped its stock price climb 5.68% over the last four weeks, even 
before today's gains. Although the company is currently caught up in a controversy surrounding pilot compensation, 
investors seem excited by a potentially great Q4, with revenues set to pop 15% and EPS expected to climb 17%â€”
based on our current consensus estimates.Tarena International, Inc. TEDU[3]This Chinese firm offers a range of 
professional IT education services, from Java to Linux. Now, Tarena International students will have better access 
to student loans after the company announced[4] a new strategic partnership with China-based MYbank today. 
Tarena International saw its stock price climb over 3.20% after the news broke. The company is currently a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold) and sports a 'B' for Value and an 'A' for Growth in our Style Scores system. Tarena International is 
set to release its Q3 results next Monday.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in 
global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it 
will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make 
the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>[5]Want the latest recommendations from

knife 1940 There can be little doubt that the British, in general, have a sense of humor. And that's perhaps the lens 
through which we should view the country these days. After all, what other options do we have?
 A comment yesterday to a Guardian article[2] sums up the situation quite perfectly in just a few words (note: 
Dignitas has something to do with assisted dying): Brexit is rapidly becoming like someone who booked a trip to 
Dignitas when they were told they were dying and has now been told there's a cure. But they're going to 
Switzerland anyway, because they can't face dealing with Ryanair's customer service team.There are two main 
British political parties, Tories and Labour, which fight each other whenever and wherever they can. Moreover, each 
party has several camps that fight each other even more, if at all possible. The George W.- friendly Tony Blair 
Orchestra in the Labour Party seems to have lost out to the actually left-wing Jeremy Corbynistas for now, but they 
won't give up without a fight (power is their only hobby). Blair is still commenting from the sidelines on Corbyn's 
perceived follies while his faithful lament about how their Tone was misled by 43 into bombing Iraq. The Tories have 
gone full-monty Monty Python. John Cleese et al must feel at least a pang of jealousy. 40 Tory MPs have allegedly 
gathered to demand for PM Theresa May to quit. A whole bunch of both Labour and Tory lawmakers threaten to 
tackle her over not allowing them a vote in any Brexit deal (which for now is entirely hypothetical). Other voices 
across party lines demand the resignation -or sacking- of foreign not-so-very-ministerial Boris Johnson. One Tory 
MP, the Rt. Hon. John Redwood MP, who's also Chief Global Strategist for Charles Stanley, wrote an op-ed in the 
FT telling investors to pull their money out of the UK[3]. You can't make that kind of stuff up. Or you can, but no-one 
would believe a word. The Python crew would have never made a dime if they had started out today, because life in 
Britain has now seriously trumped art. When the other guys are funnier without even trying, maybe comedy's not 
your thing. And that's how we slide seamlessly right down into Theresa May and the Holy Grail, the probably best 
representation of what is going on. May never wanted a Brexit, but she's so power hungry that she jumped at a 
chance of defending what she doesn't believe in. By the way, apart maybe from Corbyn, all the actors in this 
comedy are in it not because they care for their country, but for themselves, exclusively. Brilliant video, by the way. 
Play Video[4] Not that Brexit is necessarily such a terrible thing. Putting distance between yourselves and the 
European Union may well be the most sensible thing there is. Because Brussels is now defined more than anything 
by what it has done -and failed to do- to Greece, to the refugees and to Catalonia. And it will never be able to shake 
that off. The EU, just like the UK, is ruled by people who care only about themselves. Our political systems self-
select for sociopaths, with precious few exceptions. Even if you see Brexit as a purely economical move, which 
Tories Trump Python
most people do even though it's very much not true, the British people should rejoice knowing that they won't be the 
ones forking over for the next pan-European bank bailout. Then again, they'll have to bail out their own banks. 
Which have grown way out of hand, the price paid for wanting to become a global finance center.  Nor will the 
British people be forced to pay up for the newly-revived, scary-as-hell and unholy idea of a European army, an idea 
that originated in the 1950s and has re-gained support the very moment Britain voted for Brexit: EU To Sign 
Defense Pact, May Allow Limited British Role http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-defence/eu-to-sign-defense-
pact-may-allow-limited-british-role-idUSKBN1DD0PX?il=0  France, Germany and 20 other EU governments are set 
to sign a defense pact on Monday they hope marks a new era of European military integration to cement unity after 
Britain's decision to quit the bloc. In Europe's latest attempt to lessen its reliance on the United States, the 22 
governments will create a formal club that should give the European Union a more coherent role in tackling 
international crises. 'We've never come this far before,' said a senior EU official said of EU defense integration 
efforts that date back to a failed bid in the 1950s. 'We are in a new situation.' The election of pro-European 
Emmanuel Macron as France's president and warnings by U.S. President Donald Trump that European allies must 
pay more towards their security have propelled the project forward, diplomats said.  [..] A system to spot 
weaknesses across EU armed forces, in coordination with U.S.-led NATO, is due to start in a pilot stage, while a 
multi-billion-euro EU fund to support the pact is still under negotiation. Long blocked by Britain, which feared the 
creation of an EU army, defense integration was revived by France and Germany after Britons voted to leave the 
EU in June 2016. [..] London is not part of the initiative but British officials have been pressing for third country 
involvement. Britain's aerospace industry and its biggest defense firm BAE Systems fear losing out, diplomats said. 
Britain may be able to join in, but only on an exceptional basis if it provides substantial funds and expertise.They 
don't even know who'll be the leader of this European Army. There are plenty of reasons this was voted down 60 
years ago and left in the dustbin ever since. A German supreme commander, anyone? The female German minister 
of defence just yesterday let slip that she supports regime change in Poland. That's all you should need to know. 
This is presented in Brussels as a money saver. European countries have too many different weapons systems, is 
the reasoning, and need to become 'more efficient'. I bet you right here and now that it will cost Europe an arm and 
an extra leg or two-three. But not Britain. Which can also, simultaneously, if and when sensible people are in office, 
ditch its grandiose notions of being an empire or world power, and cut its armed forces by 50 or 75%. And while 
they're at it, cut its arms industry into little pieces and flush them down the Thames. Brexit can be an opportunity, a 
chance for the country to fully re-invent itself. But first, the Python-styled tragic comedy starring Theresa and Boris 
will have to be played to its tragic finale. To that end, and since it just wouldn't feel fair to leave him out, let's make 
sure we reserve a role for George Orwell as well - it comes natural: UK Government Tensions Rise After Leak Of 
'Orwellian' Memo Sent To May            https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/12/uk-government-tensions-
rise-after-leak-of-letter-to-prime-minister  The tensions in Theresa May's government intensified on Sunday night 
ahead of this week's vital votes on the Brexit bill, as ministers accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of sending 
an 'Orwellian' set of secret demands to No 10. As an increasingly weakened prime minister faces the possibility of 
parliamentary defeats on the bill, government colleagues have said they are aghast at the language used by the 
foreign secretary and the environment secretary in a joint private letter.  The leaked letter - a remarkable show of 
unity from two ministers who infamously fell out during last year's leadership campaign - appeared to be designed 
to push May decisively towards a hard Brexit and limit the influence of former remainers. It complained of 
'insufficient energy' on Brexit in some parts of the government and insisted any transition period must end in June 
2021 - a veiled attack on the chancellor, Philip Hammond. A decision as big and defining as Brexit should always 
have been executed by a government, or a coalition, in which as broad a spectrum of the population as possible is 
represented. It's crazy to let just one party push through their version, especially when views are so divergent and 
tensions run this high. The Tories have just a slight majority.  But really, all Labour have to do is wait until May and 
Boris and Gove and all the others run out of gas and their engine seizes. They lost two ministers in a week and 
more will follow. So Labour makes a peace offer, knowing full well it won't be accepted, but has to be made just for 
form. As per tomorrow, May's EU Withdrawal Bill will be discussed in Parliament and the next episode of Theresa 
May and the Holy Grail can start. John Cleese will be watching, thinking every five minutes: 'Why didn't I think of 
that?'. The Bill will be ripped to shreds, between a Hard Brexit and a No Brexit side, and hundreds of amendments, 
and May will be ripped along with it.  Even her chances of lasting just the week are slim. She has to turn to Labour 
for support, but she can't. If she does, Boris will smell his opportunity for the top post. He might even get it, but that 
would lead to something awfully close to civil war; still, maybe that's inevitable anyway, and perhaps it would be a 
good thing. Cards on the table. UK Labour Makes Brexit Offer to May as Future in Balance            
Tories Trump Python
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-13/u-k-labour-says-may-lacks-power-to-deliver-brexit-transition  
Keir Starmer, the party's Brexit spokesman, wrote to May on Monday telling her there was a 'sensible majority' in 
Parliament to secure a two-year transition deal for after Brexit. That would allow Britain to stay inside the European 
Union's single market and customs union after 2019 while it completes trade talks with the bloc. He said the 
opposition to such an arrangement came from Conservatives. 'Over recent weeks, it has become increasingly clear 
that you alone do not have the authority to deliver a transitional deal with Europe and to take the necessary steps to 
protect jobs and the economy,' Starmer wrote in the letter, which was released by his office. May is unlikely to 
welcome Labour's offer, which highlights the fragility of her position. The premier, who lost two cabinet ministers in 
a week to different scandals, has received a letter from pro-Brexit rival Boris Johnson demanding a bolder approach 
to the divorce, the Mail on Sunday reported. And 40 Conservative lawmakers back a challenge to her leadership, 
The Sunday Times said, just eight short of the number that triggers a vote. [..] May's landmark Brexit legislation, the 
EU Withdrawal Bill, returns to Parliament on Tuesday, where it faces hundreds of proposed amendments to be 
considered over eight days of debate. Even with the backing of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, May 
only has a slim majority. Tories who want to keep close ties to the EU have put their names on many of the 
measures, suggesting the government will have to back down or be defeated.They're talking about dates and 
timelines to present proposals to the EU, but they'll never agree on any. And even if they do, Brussels will be ready 
to tear them to pieces. It's hard to see how a Brexit will ever happen, but it's easy to see that if it ever does, it'll be 
an absolutely fabulous mess. And then even John Cleese won't be laughing anymore. [ 1]:

total production inched up 16.4% year over year to 2.462 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoe/d). Key 
project ramp ups primarily drove the upside. Segmental profits improved to $2,338 million from $1,431 million in the 
year-ago quarter, courtesy of higher refinery throughput. (Read: BP Surpasses Q3 Earnings Estimates on Higher

Brexit: living in fantasy land
Brexit: living in fantasy land
EU Referendum
November 5, 2017 Sunday 12:46 AM EST

Length: 1361 words

Nov 05, 2017( EU Referendum: http://www.eureferendum.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Booker in his column[1] 
today deals with one of the consequences of leaving the Single Market. The problem, he says, is that, by choosing 
to leave not just the EU but also the wider European Economic Area (EEA), we become to the EU a "third 
country".As Ryanair explained to a Lords committee back in March, the "traffic rights underpinning the bulk of air 
traffic to and from the UK will no longer exist". To fly anywhere outside the UK, we will have to negotiate more than 
100 complex bilateral agreements with other countries.  Also, as we pointed out last week, our airlines must also 
apply to the EU to become a "third country operator". But they can only do this once we have left the EU; and by a 
devilish Catch-22 in the rules, it then takes 30 days before they can be approved to allow us to fly again. All of this, 
says Booker, will be hard enough to negotiate if we do get a deal. 
With Theresa May's "no deal", forget it. But when the Commons Transport committee recently interviewed 
luminaries from the airline industry, none of it got mentioned. Like David Davis, the chief executives of British 
Airways and Heathrow merely assured MPs in effect that somehow everything will be "all right on the night". No one 
present seemed to have the faintest idea of just what a disaster we could be heading for. But, yet again, if only we 
had chosen to stay in the EEA, none of these problems would arise. Predictably, Booker's piece attracts its usual 
collection of naysayers, unable or unwilling to address the reality of the consequences of this line of action. But 
what makes their ritual denial all the more ironic is an article yesterday in the Telegraph[2] which more or less 
endorses what Booker has to say. In the article, we are treated to the warnings of "three separate EU sources in 
both Brussels and a leading EU capital" to the effect that the British government is living in "fantasy land" if it 
believes that it can an amicable break-up with the EU in the event of a "basic' Brexit".Senior EU officials and 
diplomats are saying that British expectations of a "no-deal, deal" have failed to understand the ramifications of the 
UK pulling out Europe without paying its bills. Although David Davis believes the EU would do a "basic" (or "bare 
bones") agreement in the "very, very improbable" event that a deal proved beyond the two sides, thereby averting 
the worst-case scenario where we leave with no agreement at all. "Whatever happens we will have a basic deal 
without the bits we really want", Davis said. However the European officials are "adamant" that if the UK exits the 
EU without a deal - leaving an immediate â‚¬20 billion black hole in the EU's seven-year budget framework - there will 
be no appetite to engineer a soft landing for the UK. In fact, the words used by a senior EU diplomat leave no room 
for optimism. "This is pure fantasy", he says. "The idea of a 'no-deal deal' completely fails to understand the EU, or 
the fury that would result if the British leave without paying their bills". He adds: "At that point, the EU wouldn't be 
looking to make a parachute for the UK, it will only be working out how to cut strings".Then, we are told, a second 
Brussels-based source was equally clear. "If things go really sour the 27 will be in no mood to try to collate a 
number of last-minute mini emergency deals for 'free'. We'll be busy enough trying to sort out the budget 
Brexit: living in fantasy land
fallout".This fits entirely with the observations of Sir Ivan Rogers[3] and kicks into touch the fatuous idea[4] that the 
UK negotiating team can walk away from Brussels on the Friday, having closed the book the Article 50 negotiations, 
and then turn up on the Monday morning bright-eyed and bushy-tailed ready to discuss a series of mini-deals - 
including a comprehensive air services agreement. This is a fiction created by the "Ultras" who originally thought 
they could rely on "WTO rules", only to find that there were huge areas not covered. In an attempt to fill in the gaps, 
the "no dealers" thus invented the concepts of the "unmanaged" and "managed" no-deal, the latter having been 
embraced by the Department for Exiting the European Union. In the "unmanaged" scenario, which the Telegraph 
reminds us was recently described as a "bad-tempered" Brexit by Philip Hammond, the UK "would crash out of the 
EU with no deal whatsoever, causing significant initial disruption over trade, aviation, data-sharing" - and much 
else.  However, given the scale of likely chaos, even the hardest of the "Ultras" acknowledge that this would be 
hard to bear. Thus the envisage this entirely fictional "managed" no-deal scenario. This has the Government 
believing it would strike a number of quick deals to mitigate the worst impacts of leaving without a trade deal. The 
Telegraph refers to the use of "Mutual Recognition Agreements" to keep trade flowing, although it probably means 
the MRAs on conformity assessment. These, and "separate deals to keep planes flying and data flowing" would 
comprise the "managed" no deal. Already there is disagreement between DexEU and the Treasury over how long it 
would take to stand up such deals - if they were offered. The Treasury has argued preparations would need to 
begin as soon as March next year, if it became politically apparent that a deal with Brussels was impossible, while 
DexEU believes the Brexit brinkmanship could run up until October before seeking a "managed" crash out. But 
another complication arises in that EU sources are warning that any "no deal" scenario that took place outside the 
Article 50 framework - which, the Telegraph says, can be ratified by a majority of EU states - would also force the 
UK to ratify those "quick" deals through the EU's 38 national and regional parliaments. "Even the simplest the 
aviation deal, for example, could not be drafted overnight", the Brussels source warns. "And even if it could be, the 
political environment surrounding a breakdown in talks would hardly be conducive to rapid ratification by EU 
parliaments".Worryingly though, nothing here begins to approach the full complexity of the issues that have to be 
faced. It is a fundamental tenet of international law that parties to an agreement any bind other parties which did not 
take part directly in the negotiations, and sign up to them. In that the Article 50 settlement is secured by qualified 
majority voting, there is a limit to what can included without breaching international law. Aviation deals, for instance, 
would have to be agreed outside the Article 50 process with unanimous assent by all parties. And if, as is quite 
rightly observed, an aviation deal could not be drafted "overnight", there will necessarily be a hiatus before an 
agreement can be reached. In days gone past, when Booker had picked up something of importance, with wider 
relevance than just his column, he used to let his paper know and they built in his findings into other stories. This 
has long ceased to happen, but had the paper taken not of Booker's words about TCO approval, this article could 
have factored it in. That there is a 30-day gap between applying and being granted TCO approval is not an 
invention. If the EU sticks to the letter of its own law, UK-registered airlines fleets will, perforce, be grounded for 
those 30 days, even if we leave the EU with a deal. With many other aspects to be satisfied - such as REACH 
registration - there are huge complexities awaiting us even if we settle an amicable Article 50 agreement. And, if - 
as indeed the EU is saying - "no deal" means what it says, walking away without a deal is, as it always has been, a 
recipe for catastrophe. [ 1]: https://behindthepaywallblog.wordpress.com/2017/11/04/fake-news-how-the-bbc-and-

Nov 02, 2017( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We spoke to KLM 
Royal Dutch Airlines[1] CEO Pieter Elbers to find out how his company has responded to the rise of low-cost 
carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet[2]. Following is a transcript of the video. Pieter Elbers: Well, low-cost in Europe 
started about 20 years ago. 
And the big low-cost leaders in Europe, Ryanair and EasyJet, they were founded back then. My personal view is 
that for especially the first decade of their existence, network carriers like ourselves sort of underestimated, ignored 
â€” almost arrogantly ignored â€” the rise of low-cost carriers.  With that, we can see that their share in the European 
landscape has steadily increased and is now anywhere between 42% and 45% of all flights in Europe are with low-
cost carriers. And a percentage which is significantly larger than in the US where it's about a third. With that, we 
have embarked on a program in KLM a few years ago whereby we sort of said, we're going to defend our European 
network and we're going to make sure that we do the right thing for our customers on the European network. So we 
have lowered our cost, we have increased our fleet utilization, we have changed our commercial offers on probably 
60% of all our European destinations, which are about 80 destinations. We do have levels which are matching the 
low-cost carriers. So this combination of cost-cutting on the one-hand side, investing in our product and our service. 
You know we have coffee for free, we have beer for free. And if it's beer, it should be Dutch beer. So we have all 
that stuff for our customers, and yet at very competitive prices. And with that, we have been able to change our 
European network from a loss-making situation into a profitable situation. See Also: What it's like to fly on North

Oct 31, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Ireland's 
Ryanair is on course to post record annual profits despite a recent pilot shortage that forced it to cancel 20,000 
flights. But the airline is concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the UK's Brexit deal.Ryanair on Tuesday said 
half-yearly revenue rose by 7 percent to 4.43 billion euros ($5.15 billion), while profit after tax reached 1.29 billion 
euros, up 11 percent. 
The number of passengers carried also grew by 11 percent year-on-year from April to September.The airline also 
noted that the cancellation of thousands of flights â€” an emergency measure due to pilot rostering problems to free 
up standby pilots to ensure the smooth operation of its 400 planes â€” could end up costing the budget airline up to 
100 million euros in this financial year.In the weeks after it announced the cancellations, Europe's biggest airline by 
passenger numbers saw 2 billion euros knocked off its market value. But it recovered around half of that loss on 
Tuesday when the company's shares climbed over 6 percent, after it told investors that bookings were 
up.Meanwhile the demise of Air Berlin and Britain's Monarch Airlines are bound to help Ryanair by cutting capacity 
and freeing up much-needed pilots."These strong half-year results reinforce the robust nature of Ryanair's low-fare, 
pan-European growth model even during a period which suffered a material failure in our pilot rostering function in 
early September," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.But O'Leary said the airline remains "concerned at the 
continuing uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in March 2019." tr/kd (Reuters, dpa)

Oct 31, 2017( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair has posted an 11 
per cent rise in half-year profits despite a rota blunder which saw thousands of flights scrapped. The Dublin-based 
carrier's headline measure of profit after tax rose 11 per cent to â‚¬1.29bn (Â£1.14bn) for the six months to the end of 
September and it said it remained on course to meet its full-year target, Sky[1] reports. 
Passenger traffic rose 11 per cent to 72.1 million but Ryanair said growth would slow to 4 per cent in the second 
half of the financial year following the grounding of 25 aircraft. This would mean traffic of 129 million for the full year, 
two million fewer than had been expected. Ryanair said the 'rostering failure' had prompted it to hike pilot pay, 
which it now says is 20 per cent higher than that offered by rival Norwegian. However, Ryanair remains locked in a 
stand-off with crews at its London Stansted base over the issue. It said the pay changes would add â‚¬45m to its 
crew costs and â‚¬100m in a full year, and that it was confident it could attract the number of pilots needed to fulfil its 
growth plans. Ryanair's cancellations have affected 700,000 passengers covering a period from September through 
to March next year and are set to cost the airline â‚¬25m as puts them on alternative flights or refunds them. But the 
carrier said it saw 'no reason to alter' guidance that it expects to record full-year profit in a range of â‚¬1.4bn to 
â‚¬1.45bn. Ryanair has seen a sharp fall in its share price since the cancellations crisis and has apologised to 
customer affected. The stock opened nearly 4 per cent higher on the half-year figures. Chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said: 'These results reinforce the robust nature of Ryanair's low fare, pan-European growth model even 
during a period which suffered a material failure in our pilot rostering function in early September.' Ryanair said it 
had cut fares by 5 per cent in the six-month period and that fares in the second half would fall by 4-6 per cent rather 
than the 5-7 per cent previously guided. The airline also underlined its concern about post-Brexit flight disruption if 
there is no industry agreement before September next year, and that it was worried that the UK Government 
'continued to underestimate the likelihood to flight disruption to/from the UK'. That came a day after the bosses of 
British Airways owner International Airlines Group and Heathrow played down such risks in a hearing before MPs. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair said it was responding to the opportunities created by the collapse of rivals such as Monarch, 
Air Berlin and Alitalia in the over-crowded European airline market and believed other 'financially troubled' EU 
airlines 
would 
follow 
them.Ryanair

11:00 With politicians seemingly trying to ban the car, Mike Rutherford tries his luck with public transport Ruling and 
opposition politicians make unlikely bedfellows. But collectively they operate a highly effective 'cartel' tasked with 
expunging motorists. 
They do their bit to ban most (ie diesel and petrol) cars, plus drivers, usually the poorer ones who can't afford the 
newest combustion, 100 per cent electric[2] or hydrogen engines. Hefty tolls/fines to use some cities, tunnels, 
bridges and roads, plus extortionate on-street parking charges, are the icing on the cake as they chip away at us. â€¢ 
Best electric cars on sale[3] For much of this month and purely in the name of real-world research, I tried public 
transport. I missed a rush-hour train that left three minutes earlier than scheduled, demonstrating woeful contempt 
for the official railway timetable and stranded passengers like me. Armed with a pre-paid ticket, I arrived early for an 
off-peak car ferry. But an attempt was made to punish my premature arrival crime by doubling the fare, despite 
there being more space on the earlier boat than the later one. I paid up-front for a National Express coach that 
failed to turn up, and I'm still fighting for my refund. Check-in staff blaming 'computer problems' tried to deny me and 
my travelling companion access to a BA flight for which we checked in on time and had prepaid/reserved/confirmed 
seats aboard. Only after protesting were we allowed on. Of course, the plane left late and arrived late. Mind you, I 
was one of the luckier air commuters during a month when Monarch collapsed, Ryanair cancelled thousands of 
flights, and Alitalia and Air Berlin struggled to regain altitude. I've had the displeasure of flying short-haul with all 
these deeply-flawed airlines and can honestly say that each repeatedly filled me with no confidence. I saw 
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling symbolically boarding and promoting one of his heavily-subsidised flagship 
Hitachi trains, which left late, arrived late and leaked so severely that water-logged passenger seats were 
decommissioned, leaving Grayling like a drowned rat. The above are some of the alternative transport modes 
senior politicians like him expect you and I to endure daily as they continue to cull our cars. Honestly, I don't know 
what I loathe most: the overwhelming stench of the political hypocrisy or the unmistakable pong from the rotten and 
expensive alternatives to the car. Do you agree with Mike? Is public transport a poor alternative to the car? Let us 
know

Oct 27, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  After 
nearly four decades plying the skies, Germany's once-second largest airline will complete its final flight, followed by 
a bittersweet farewell staff party amid attempts to split up and sell its remaining assets.While flight crews don their 
uniforms and put on brave smiles for the airline's final flights on Friday, bankruptcy administrators continue to work 
on deals for splitting up the airline's remaining assets amongst buyers.The company filed for bankruptcy 
administration in August, after cash injections from its principal recent investor, Gulf airline Etihad, dried up. The 
German airline lost more than three-quarters of a billion euros in 2016 (782 million euros, $909 million), and hopes 
of turning around the numbers had lost credibility.A German federal government loan kept the company's aircraft 
flying for a few months, to look after the interests of its clients and employees whilst administrators negotiated deals 
with other airlines to buy routes and planes, and an effort was organised to find new jobs for the airline's air, 
ground, and administrative staff.Read more: Air Berlin's fall to earthJust a few years ago, Air Berlin was Germany's 
second-largest airline. It was cherished amongst Germans for its flights to holiday destinations, especially to 
Mallorca, an island off the eastern coast of Spain that's beloved amongst Germans, Swedes and Brits looking for a 
break from the grey-brown tones of northern Europe. 
In contrast to some of its cut-price budget airline rivals, Air Berlin made small gestures to keep its customers sweet, 
distributing chocolate hearts at the exits after every flight.But its low-cost rivals - especially EasyJet and RyanAir, 
increasingly pressured Air Berlin's margins. The company had taken on a lot of debt by borrowing money to finance 
acquisitions over the years â€” a growth strategy that eventually overreached.Bound together with Berlin's modern 
historyAir Berlin was founded four decades ago by an American pilot, Kim Lundgren, who took advantage of the 
fact that at the time, the post-war treaty amongst the victorious powers specified that only carriers based in Britain, 
France, or the United States were permitted to fly to West Berlin. The first Air Berlin flight from Berlin's Tegel Airport 
left for Palma de Mallorca on April 28, 1979.After the Berlin Wall came down, enterpreneur Joachim Hunold 
acquired a majority stake in the airline, and a phase of rapid growth via acquisition began.When Abu Dhabi based 
Etihad, which had invested heavily in Air Berlin in recent years, lost hope of the airline's return to profitability in 
August, the fate of Air Berlin's 8,000 employees hung in the balance. Negotiations for a transition of the company's 
assets - above all, its starting and landing slots and its aircraft - occurred alongside a search for opportunities to 
keep its employees in work.What emerged was that the bulk of Air Berlin's airplanes and landing slots will be taken 
over by Lufthansa, as will some 3,000 employees, who will move to Lufthansa's low-budget subsidiary 
EuroWings.Read more: Lufthansa reaching for global player statusThe deal with Lufthansa will allow administrators 
to repay in full the 150 million euro loan that was extended by the German government to keep Air Berlin flying 
whilst wrap-up negotiations were underway.Talks are on-going to transfer additional Air Berlin assets and

Oct 25, 2017( DESIblitz: http://www.desiblitz.com Delivered by Newstex)  "I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit 
and ambition." A 19-year-old British Asian teenager has landed a remarkable achievement as he becomes one of 
the UK's youngest millionaires! Akshay Ruparelia earned this title when his successful business was valued at Â£12 
million. 
Just over a year after it began, which he set up while studying at school. Living in north London, he created an 
online estate agency called Doorsteps.co.uk. Inspired by Ryanair's business model, Akshay sells properties at a 
much lower cost than bigger, high street estate agents. Quickly gathering success, it now stands as the 18th 
biggest estate agent in the UK. An outstanding achievement considering the teenager set up the business whilst 
still in education. But what prompted him to take on this impressive venture? Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he 
explains his interest in business grew from an early age: 'I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit and ambition, 
whether it was selling sweets at school when I was 12 or 13, or something else'For his first company, he took 
inspiration from the business[1] model of Ryanair, saying: 'Mr O'Leary began by selling flights for just Â£4.99. His 
point was that if you can offer customers something at a price they can't believe and you deliver what you say you 
will, you hook people in and your business will work.' With this in mind, the 19-year-old applied it into real estate. 
Believing that he could offer lower prices for properties, he began to set up Doorsteps.co.uk[2]. However, he only 
started with Â£7,000 and borrowed additional money from relatives.'I got the website up and running and after a 
couple of weeks a man in Sussex asked me to sell his home and a separate chunk of land he owned beside it 
[sic]. I had to pay my sister's boyfriend Â£40 to drive me to Sussex to take photographs of the house. I hadn't passed 
my driving test and didn't have a car.' Akshay revealed he placed the five-bedroom house for Â£485,000 and its land 
(that contained a swimming pool) for Â£185,000. He added: 'I'd sold it within three weeks.' However, he could revel in 
the thrill of his first sale, as he needed to revise for exams. Now, he employs 12 people to help run his business. In 
addition, he hires a growing network of self-employed mothers, who show clients around properties instead of the 
high street chains' usual business suit figures. The entrepreneur said:'Quite rightly people trust mums. Every mum 
who works for me will be honest and tell the truth. It is important. For the majority of people selling their home is the 
biggest financial transaction of their lives.'As he becomes one of the UK's youngest millionaire[3], Akshay plans to 
continue with his business. Despite an offer at Oxford University for a degree in Economics and Management, he 
has put this on for hold. Akshay also works on supporting his parents, who are both deaf, who he credits as 
motivation for his ambitions. Sarah is an English and Creative Writing graduate who loves video games, books and 
looking after her mischievous cat Tyrion. Her motto: "Nothing is impossible," by Audrey Hepburn.Image courtesy of

Oct 25, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The last week saw key 
airline players like JetBlue Airways JBLU[1], United Continental Holdings UAL[2] and Hawaiian Holdings HA[3] 
announcing their respective third-quarter 2017 numbers. While JetBlue and United Continental outperformed with 
respect to both earnings and revenues, Hawaiian Holdings reported mixed results. This Honolulu County, HI-based 
carrier reported better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenues.Despite the earnings beat, shares 
of United Continental fell approximately 12% on Oct 19. The lack of clarity provided by the company, on the 
conference call, pertaining to its efforts to check costs and boost revenues disappointed investors. Consequently, 
the stock tumbled, registering its biggest one-day percentage decline in eight years.European low-cost carrier 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[4] also grabbed headlines by virtue of its dispute with pilots. Alaska Airlines, the 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK[5], featured in the news by virtue of the decision to expand its 
San Diego service.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 2.4% to $110.24 in the past five days, 
mainly due to the issues related to United Continental.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return

% Return[6] (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Oct 17, 2017[7]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important 
Stories 1. Despite the recent hurricanes United Continental reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter 
of 2017. The company's earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) came in at $2.22 per share, beating 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. Earnings were, however, 28.6% lower than the year-ago figure due to 
higher costs (read more: United Continental Q3 Earnings ...venues Top Estimates[8]).2. JetBlue Airways' third-
quarter 2017 earnings of 55 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. 
Quarterly earnings, however, declined 5.2% from the year ago figure due to higher costs. The recent hurricanes 
also hurt results. Operating revenues came in at $1,813 million, just ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$1,809.3 million. In fact, the top line increased 4.7% from the year-ago figure (read more: JetBlue's Q3 Earnings 
Top, Fall Y/Y on High Costs[9]).3. Hawaiian Holdings' third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.92 per share beat the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85. Quarterly revenues of $719.6 million, however, fell short of the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $720.6 million. While earnings per share were flat, revenues increased on a year-over-year 
basis.Operating revenue per available seat mile in the quarter climbed 5.8% year over year. However, the metric is 
projected to be down 1% to up 2% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2017. For full-year 2017, the 
same is forecasted to grow in the band of 5% to 6%.Capacity is projected to grow between 4% and 6% in the final 
quarter of 2017. CASM, excluding fuel, is also projected to rise significantly for the ongoing quarter primarily due to 
the higher labor costs. Fuel cost per gallon (economic) is anticipated in the band of $1.75-$1.85 for the fourth 
Airline Stock Roundup: JBLU , UAL Q3 Earnings Beat, RYAAY in Focus
quarter. The metric is expected in the band of $1.65 to $1.75 for full-year 2017.4. According to a Reuters report[10], 
most pilots at the company's largest base rejected the offer from the management pertaining to better pay and 
working conditions. This marks a setback for the company as it grapples with pilot shortages. The issue had 
disrupted operations, leading to multiple flight cancellations in the last few weeks.5. In a bid to expand further along 
the West Coast, Alaska Airlines started operating new daily non-stop flights to Albuquerque from October 18. 
Markedly, Albuquerque is sixth new non-stop destination from San Diego since August for this low-cost carrier. The 
airline aims to operate 45 peak day flights to 29 nonstop destinations from San Diego by Dec 31, 2017. You can

shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months.                   The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red in the past week leading to the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index's significant decline. Over the last six months, the sector tracker lost 4%. Spirit Airlines 
was the major laggard during this period, experiencing a 40.6% price decline.What's Next in the Airline Space?The

Oct 18, 2017( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  KUALA LUMPUR, 
Malaysia (AP) â€” Malaysia Airlines outgoing CEO Peter Bellew says he decided to return to Ryanair as a form of 
national service because the Irish budget airline needed his help. Bellew, who was previously Ryanair's director of 
flight operations, joined the Malaysian flag carrier in 2015 as its chief operating officer. He replaced Christoph 
Mueller as CEO in July 2016, after Mueller left abruptly, citing personal reasons.Ryanair announced Tuesday that 
Bellew would return as its chief operations officer to tackle a pilot shortage that led to the cancellation of more than 
20,000 flights over the winter season. Malaysia Airlines said in a statement that Bellew's departure was 
'unexpected' but stressed its turnaround plan remained on track. Bellew said Wednesday that love for his country is 
pulling him back to Ireland. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1] [ 1]:

Alitalia, Lufthansa braces for a â‚¬500 million bid, Corriere della Sera reported on Monday. The offer apparently 
entails firing 6,000 out of the 12,000-strong workforce, whilst shedding many of its short and medium range routes.  
The Italian government stepped in last Friday to extend a second â‚¬300 million bridge loan to Alitalia, that is, in 
addition to the â‚¬500 million loan granted in May. Rome expects the Italian carrier to have found a new buyer or go 
into liquidation by April 2018. However, Lufthansa's demand for a 50% cut in Alitalia's workforce is seen as 'too 
brutal' by the Italian government. Ryanair has withdrawn its interest for the Italian national carrier. The German 
national carrier already has a strong presence in the Italian market via its subsidiary Air Dolomiti, headquartered in 
Verona. Recently, Lufthansa announced an agreement to take over Air Berlin, Germany's second biggest airline. 
The company also has control of the Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Swiss International Airlines. Share on

would entail drastic job losses. 
Too drastic for the government in Rome to even consider?Germany's Lufthansa was ready to make an offer of 
about 500 million euros ($590 million) to bankrupt Alitalia, Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper reported Monday.It 
said Lufthansa's bid would concern Alitalia's aviation business, but would exclude its ground operations.The 
newspaper reported the bid would entail a 50-percent cut of the Italian carrier's roughly 12,000 employees. 
According to Corriere, the government in Rome considered the offer "too brutal in terms of job losses."Ryanair out

binding offers. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr expressed an interest "in a newly positioned Alitalia," describing the 
company in its current state as not economically viable.Alitalia, struggling to compete with low-cost rivals, went into 
administration in May after staff rejected job and salary cuts as part of a 2-billion-euro rescue plan.Irish no-frills 
carrier Ryanair had expressed early interest in Alitalia, but said two weeks ago it was dropping the idea as it 
struggled with the fallout from thousands of cancellations of its own flights owing to a shortage of pilots.The Italian

Oct 16, 2017( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  Here's a piece in 
the Financial Times[1] that claims that Britain has lots of monopolies and that a state that believes in 'private 
business and free markets would bust more trusts'. The FT has a long-running vendetta against Uber (about half of 
its Alphaville blog[2] is devoted to posts about it being financially unviable, overvalued, exploitative, and useless) 
and this adds to that pile. Its big mistake, in my mind, is to confuse market share with market power. Market 
power means a firm being able to price its products above the level that would emerge in a competitive system - it 
requires quite a bit of speculation about what the 'true' competitive price should be, but maybe you know it when 
you see it (if this seems a bit loose to you, read Ford's article to see the sort of approach he takes). Market share is 
what portion of a given market's total revenue goes to a particular firm.  The two are related, but different, and if you 
get them mixed up you'll go awry. That's because a firm that has a large market share might still be in a precarious 
position and need to price its products highly competitively to maintain its share of the market. 
Tesco, for example, has a large share of the grocery market - around 28%[3]. But it has been forced to engage in a 
fierce price war with stores like Aldi and Lidl over the last ten years, cutting prices by 1.8% in the past year despite 
positive CPI inflation throughout that period. Ryanair is by some measures the largest airline in Europe[4], but who 
thinks that would stay the same if it suddenly raised its prices to British Airways levels? The shakiness of using 
market share as a stand-in for market power is made clear by some of the other markets Ford says are 
'concentrated' - mobile networks, groceries and banking. None of these really pass the smell test. You can get 
mobile plans that give you nearly unlimited 4G, minutes and texts for Â£14/month[5], and the big firms are investing 
heavily in 5G. The grocery market, as already discussed, has been getting more competitive over the last decade, 
and my guess is that the biggest barrier to this is the difficulty of Lidl and Aldi in getting planning permission for new 
stores. I admit that I am not even convinced that banking, dysfunctional in so many other ways, is uncompetitive 
when it comes to current accounts for ordinary consumers - many accounts will literally pay you to move and 
switching is easy (I've done it three times in the past two years). The biggest problem, as with the energy market, is 
that most people do not realise the benefits and easiness of switching[6]. So when Ford writes that 'the real scandal 
here is the way Uber has been allowed to hoover up the London taxi market' (although he doesn't even have data 
about Uber's market share in London), the question is whether this actually harms consumers or not - and it having 
a large-ish market share is not proof of that. It seems very difficult to claim that Uber has any market power yet - it is 
barely profitable and may subsidise large parts of its service. And consumers mostly seem to love it - for example, 
850,000 people have signed the petition to 'Save Uber in London' - which is evidence that it has not harmed them 
yet. Ford doesn't actually claim that Uber is harming consumers, merely that it might do so in future once it's 
Just ignore the people who say Uber is a monopoly
established a dominant position. But pre-emptive trust-busting is a strange idea. It asks us to prosecute businesses 
solely on the basis that, someday, they might do something wrong.  Got that? You've come up with a great idea that 
gets people from point A to B quicker than anyone else, and you're making a profit while doing it. You're making 
money and you're winning customers - indeed you're so popular that some Financial Times writers think you need 
to be stopped now, before someday you raise your prices. They don't have any evidence that you can raise your 
prices without new competitors coming in, and they don't have any evidence that you've done anything to harm 
consumers yet. But they don't like the cut of your jib. We don't punish people because they might break the law 
some day, and we should ignore newspaper columnists who want to prosecute businesses because they might act 
monopolistically someday too. Some say that Uber's business model only works if it has a monopoly and that it 
must be engaged in 'predatory pricing' - it intends to keep prices artificially low until all rivals are eliminated, after 
which it will raise prices. The case in favour mostly rests on the fact that Uber is loss-making - why would they burn 
money if they didn't expect to have some powerful position in the future?  Firstly, Uber does not seem to need to 
exploit consumers to make a profit. It is (apparently) profitable in London and the United States already without 
causing harm to consumers, and although it might like to have a monopoly until it does there is no case for 
prosecuting it as one. Lots of businesses, tech firms and brick-and-mortar firms like restaurants alike, lose money 
for many years before they become profitable. But maybe getting bigger gives Uber market power. This idea relies 
on the concept of network effects - when a business gets better the more customers it has, so the market gives a 
big advantage to whichever product manages to get a critical mass of users first. Think Facebook, for instance, 
where a large part of the appeal is simply the fact that everyone you know is on it. Does, or could, Uber benefit from 
network effects in a monopolistic way? Drivers can (and in cities with multiple Uber-like services, do) have multiple 
ride-hailing apps running at the same time, so 'lock-in' even on a single evening seems unlikely. Consumers are 
betters off the more drivers there are, and more consumers means more drivers, but the costs of using two or more 
different services (Uber or black cabs, say) are very low and, in practice, the benefits of having the choice are very 
high to an individual.  For the claims of predatory pricing to work (and I stress that Ford does not say this, I am 
making the best possible version of his argument for him here) Uber would have to have some unchallengeable 
position once the minicab and black cab drivers went out of business. The fact that Lyft and other services are 
looking to get into the London market long after Uber has established itself as the dominant app suggests that, if 
present at all, network effects are not very strong. If someone can show me an example of a single city where Uber, 
once eliminating more expensive rivals, has raised prices above what its rivals' prices used to be, I'll change my 
mine.  Maybe Uber really is fundamentally unviable, as Ford and others at the FT insist. A lot of investors disagree, 
but if they're wrong, then Uber is a giant voluntary wealth transfer from investors to consumers and drivers. Who 
cares? In the end, I'm pretty sceptical about armchair entrepreneurs who claim to know how Uber can and can't 
make money. Anyone who claims to know what these markets will look like in the future is selling baloney. Unless 
they knew ten years ago that taxis, of all things, were going to be a huge market for tech, why should I listen to 
them now? The best thing we - and regulators - can do is wait and see how Uber and similar firms end up making 
money, and wait and see whether they're hurting consumers in doing so. There's one point that Ford makes that I 
think does stand up, though. Regulatory barriers to entry to the London taxi market may be holding competition 
back - not only are would-be rivals to Uber, like Taxify, being kept out by the difficulty of getting a license, even 
Uber itself faces the risk of being regulated out of existence in London. Removing barriers to competition to prevent 
monopolies 
is 
smart. 
Breaking 
up 
firms 
that 
are 
giving 
consumers 
a 
good 
deal 
isn't.

on Google+ Share on LinkedInThe takeover of Germany's second biggest airline, Air Berlin, by Lufthansa on 
Thursday was not a surprise. 
Lufthansa will pay â‚¬210 million for Air Berlin's 80 planes, its Austrian leisure travel airline Niki, its LG Walter regional 
airline, and will take on its 3,000 employees. Lufthansa's business plan is to merge Air Berlin with its Eurowings 
subsidiary. Lufthansa's CEO Carsten Spohr told Rheinische Post that Lufthansa would invest â‚¬1.5 in euros into Air 
Berlin. At its peak Berlin Air had 8,000 employees and, since 2008, the company accumulated a debt of â‚¬780 
million debt accumulated since 2008. Since its parent company Etihad withdrew its supports in August, the German 
government stepped in with a bridge loan of â‚¬150 million. The loan and the company's simultaneous bankruptcy 
have been seen by Ryanair as a ploy to promote the takeover of Air Berlin - the second biggest Airline in Germany - 
by Lufthansa, continuing in a tradition of promoting 'national champions.' Air Berlin will stop flying under its own 
banner October 28. The Irish low-cost carrier, Ryanair, will refer the takeover to the European competition authority, 
the BBC reports. Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary has called the takeover a 'stitch up.' Share on Facebook Share on

Oct 11, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  For 
years, Lufthansa has been wrangling with its pilots as the airline attempted to reduce costs. A deal struck with its 
main pilots union on Tuesday should ensure significantly less labor turbulence in the years ahead.Lufthansa 
announced a wide-ranging labor deal with its main pilot union on Tuesday, bringing an end to years of 
disagreement and raising expectations for the airline's financial prospects.Germany's largest airline agreed the deal 
in principle with the pilot trade union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) back in March, and the formal signing of the 
agreement â€” which is valid until June 2022 â€” will end the prospect of strikes, which have affected the airline in 
recent years.The deal will reduce Lufthansa's pilot staffing costs primarily through pension benefit cuts, something 
the airline has been trying to achieve for years as it tries to compete with low cost European rivals such as Ryanair 
and easyJet. 
The deal also paves the way for the hiring of up to 700 junior pilots at Lufthansa, its cargo divisions and its 
subsidiary Eurowings, previously known as Germanwings."With the collective bargaining agreement, we have 
created a foundation for a new social partnership with the VC,' said Bettina Volkens, Lufthansa's HR chief. "We are 
jointly creating a sustainable collective bargaining peace until 2022. This compromise opens up career prospects 
for our pilots and makes an important contribution to the competitiveness of our company.'Read more: Ryanair 
chaos turns tables on workers' rightsLufthansa's attempts to strike such a deal with the VC â€” which represents 
around 5,400 Lufthansa pilots â€” met strong resistance in recent years and led to several strikes, most recently in 
November 2016. While the collective labor agreement still has to be voted on by the pilot union's members in 
December, the announcement has sent Lufthansa shares up by 3.5 percent to a 16-year high. "Better cost 
structures, especially on short-haul routes, will improve the market position of Lufthansa,' said Joerg Handwerg of 
the VC.A busy autumn in the skiesIn specific terms, the deal sees the current pension scheme switch from a 
system of defined benefits to one of defined contributions. It will also see a gradual increase in the age pilots can 
retire from Lufthansa passenger services, moving up to the age of 60.Up to 700 junior pilots will be hired in the 
coming years while 600 future captain positions will be created. In addition, pilots at Lufthansa and its subsidiaries 
will receive staggered pay increases of up to 10.3 per cent and a one-off payment of up to 1.8 monthly salaries for 
the period of May 2012 until June 2022.It has been a dramatic autumn in European aviation. The mass cancellation 
of Ryanair flights across Europe has been widely attributed to an increasing shortage of pilots at the airline, 
disgruntled by poor working conditions at the low cost carrier. Last week, the Irish airline offered their pilots 
significantly improved pay and conditions in an attempt to shore up the problem.Closer to home from Lufthansas's 
perspective, Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy in August, with Lufthansa expected to take over large parts of the 
insolvent airline in the coming months.aos/kd (Reuters, AFP)

Ryanair Has Really Created a Mess For Itself
Ryanair Has Really Created a Mess For Itself

Oct 10, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  In the last month, Ryanair has 
greatly tarnished its image as a reliable operator thanks to a pilot vacation-scheduling snafu. It's been quite the 
black eye for an airline that has run such a consistently good operation for so long, and it's even more frustrating, 
because so much of the damage was self-inflicted. As I was scanning through Ryanair's press releases[1], it 
dawned on me that the story could really be told by reading between the lines (and between the releases) of the 
airline's relatively frequent communications surrounding this issue. So I thought I'd do that today.RYANAIR TO 
CANCEL LESS THAN 2% OF FLIGHTS OVER NEXT 6 WEEKS TO IMPROVE PUNCTUALITY[2] (September 15, 
2017)It started on September 15 with Ryanair saying it needed to cancel flights to improve its on-time performance. 
'Less than 2%' may not sound like a lot, and that's clearly by design. For an airline with more than 2,500 daily 
flights, that really is a whole lot of passengers. At first blush, Ryanair made it sound like the perfect storm had come 
together to hurt the airline's operation: a combination of ATC capacity delays and strikes, weather disruptions and 
the impact of increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew as the airline moves to allocate annual leave 
during a 9 month transition period (April to December 2017) to move the airline's holiday year (currently April to 
March) to a calendar year (Jan to Dec) from 1st January 2018 onwards. Trying to blame things beyond Ryanair's 
control didn't last long. Ryanair Publishes List Of Flights To Be Cancelled Up To End Of October - Over 98% Of 
Ryanair Customers Will Be Unaffected[3] - (September 18, 2017)A mere three days later, the story had changed. 
Oh sure, the airline had still canceled less than 2 percent of flights and this would only go through October 31, but it 
was no longer a confluence of factors. It was common knowledge that Norwegian and others had taken pilots from 
Ryanair with promises of long-haul flying on shiny, big airplanes, but was that really the culprit? Ryanair fired back 
sharply with this quote from Michael O'Leary. Ryanair is not short of pilots - we were able to fully crew our peak 
summer schedule in June, July and August - but we have messed up the allocation of annual leave to pilots in Sept 
and Oct because we are trying to allocate a full year's leave into a 9 month period from April to December. This 
issue will not recur in 2018 as Ryanair goes back onto a 12 month calendar leave year from 1st Jan to 31st 
December 2018. This is a mess of our own making. There's that pesky vacation problem again, but suddenly it had 
taken center stage as the heart of the issue. In short, Ryanair used to allocate leave for the year beginning in April. 
A change in government rules required the airline to move to a calendar year schedule starting in January. To do 
this, 2017 had to be a transition year where leave was compressed in the 9 months from April through December. It 
had apparently flown its pilots hard until September and then must have realized it was screwed. There wasn't 
enough pilot time to fly the September and October schedule and still give the pilots time off as required. Beginning 
in November, Ryanair would move to its winter schedule where less flying was on the docket, so it felt it could 
Ryanair Has Really Created a Mess For Itself
handle things after that point. Ryanair Cancellations - Update[4] (September 20, 2017)Two days later, Ryanair 
admitted that 315,000 customers were impacted. When put that way, it sounded a lot more massive than the 'less 
than 2%' figure. This was no tiny issue, but Ryanair seemed confident in its plan to ensure this problem got no 
worse. At Ryanair's annual meeting on September 21, CEO Michael O'Leary made it clear with his usual bluster 
that pilots wouldn't be a problem. At the meeting, O'Leary made no friends in the cockpit when he said pilots didn't 
have a difficult job[5] and he could force them to defer their leave if needed. He then said he'd dangled incentives in 
front of them, but if they were to 'misbehave' then they would have those incentives taken away. The reality of the 
situation is that many pilots were willing to play ball until O'Leary pissed them off. Pilots are used to O'Leary's 
ramblings, but this was like lightning in a bottle. It provided a rallying cry that would only make management's job 
more difficult. Yet Ryanair's press releases made it look like all was well. Cancellations ...nctuality - Update[6] 
(September 25, 2017)A week after 315,000 customers were first notified, 97 percent had been reaccommodated or 
refunded while the rest had yet to respond to the airline. On-time performance was up, cancellations were down. 
Maybe the pilot storm had blown over. The worst was over Ryanair To End Rostering Cancellations By Slowing 
Growth This Winter[7] (September 27, 2017) except it wasn't. Ryanair said it would have no trouble past October. It 
either lied or it still hadn't gotten a hold of the extent of its problems. Neither inspires confidence. Just two days after 
putting out that last glowing update, Ryanair rolled out more cuts well beyond October. For November through 
March, Ryanair decided to ground an additional 25 airplanes (out of 400). Then in April it would still hold back 10 
airplanes. This update was interesting, because the airline made it sound like there still was no pilot recruitment 
issue, yet it announced a â‚¬10,000 raise for Captains and â‚¬5,000 for First Officers at four of its bases. (Ryanair pilots 
aren't unionized but have a limited form of representation on the base level.)  It also raised questions about the 
airline's ability to handle this whole vacation issue. Incredibly, about 50 percent of Ryanair's pilots had to take a 
month off between September and December, and the airline was caught completely flat-footed. In fact, it moved its 
pilot scheduling efforts to go under its Chief People Officer, an admission that it wasn't properly set up to handle this 
function. Ryanair Explains How And When It Will Re-Route Customers Affected By Flight Cancellations[8] 
(September 29, 2017)Ryanair Responds Fully To CAR (...A) Requirements To Clarify Customer Entitlements 
During Cancellations[9] (September 29, 2017)Ryanair had been working hard to minimize the cost of rebooking 
people, but it was getting hammered over this from travelers and governments. So, it started to soften. Ryanair had 
already announced it would give coupons to people impacted by the cancellations, but on September 29 it made it 
known that options were just a) take another Ryanair flight or b) take a refund. It agreed to put passengers on other 
airlines, trains, buses, or even in a car if needed. At the same time, Ryanair had to address the fact that people 
didn't seem clear on their EU261 rights. EU261 is a law that provides compensation for travelers when travel plans 
are disrupted. Regulators felt Ryanair wasn't being clear about people's rights, trying to skirt around having to pay 
out. If that was a strategy, it didn't work. Cancellations ...nctuality - Update[10] (October 2, 2017)And then all was 
quiet for a few days. When Ryanair did resurface to talk about its problems again, it was good news. The operation 
was holding up and no further cancellations were needed. But while things seemed to calm down on the surface, 
anger was boiling over with the pilots. To try and address this, Ryanair changed its tune dramatically. On October 5, 
O'Leary sent a note to the pilots[11] in which he actually, seriously, apologized. Shocking, I know. But even beyond 
that, he announced improvement to pilot pay and working conditions. O'Leary hoped that this would quell the 
rebellion, but it didn't. Schedule Changes ...nctuality - Update[12] (October 9, 2017)Another week went by with no 
bad news. With things stabilizing in the operation, you'd think all was well. It wasn't. The pilots, still seething with 
anger, moved toward organizing. The airline has employee councils at each of its 80+ bases, and it deals with them 
individually. That sounds like a lot of work, but it prevents the entire pilot base from forming a united bloc. Now, the 
pilots moved toward something bigger. Just yesterday, a newly-formed pan-European council put out a list of 
demands[13]. For its part, Ryanair refused to meet with[14] or even recognize this new super council. Some 
expected that Michael O'Leary could lose his job over all this, but so far, that seems highly unlikely. Instead, the 
airline's Chief Operating Officer Michael Hickey resigned[15] yesterday.  Presumably this is meant to try to keep the 
critics at bay, but Ryanair has really stepped in it this time. Customers have lost confidence since the cancellations 
were dragged out over time. This will eventually be forgotten, but the damage done to pilot relationships may not 
disappear as quickly. Ryanair has failed to placate its people with its efforts so far. It's going to have to do better or 
this 
is 
likely 
to 
continue 
to 
drag 
on.

Oct 10, 2017( The ASPI Strategist: http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/ Delivered by Newstex) ;;;; Sea state This week, 
the US Navy commissioned its newest nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Washington[1]. The Virginia-class 
ship is nicknamed 'Blackfish' after the local Native American name for the killer whale. At the commissioning 
ceremony, held at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia, the ship's commanding officer, Commander Gabriel Cavazos, 
concluded his address with the ship's unofficial motto: 'Fear the Blackfish'[2]. The USS Washington is the 14th 
Virginia-class submarine to be built. The aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan has made a port call in Hong Kong[3] 
on its way to joint naval drills with South Korea. The Reagan, accompanied by the guided-missile destroyer USS 
Chafee[4], is the first US aircraft carrier to dock at Hong Kong since the USS John C. Stennis was denied entry[5] 
by China last year. 
The crew of the Reagan and the Chaffee were able to play tourist, and Xinhua has reported[6] that some sailors 
'celebrated the Chinese traditional Mid-Autumn Festival with Hong Kong's primary school students'. The US Naval 
institute has released some remarkable footage of the USS John S. McCain being loaded onto a transport[7] to be 
taken to Japan for repairs after its collision last month. Flight path The Afghan Air Force has received the first two 
Black Hawk helicopters from the US, as part of a plan to deliver a total of 159 helicopters by 2024. The deteriorating 
relations between Moscow and Washington[8] meant that the Afghans were having a difficult time maintaining the 
Russian Mi-17 helicopter fleet, prompting the change to the US UH-60 model. The Black Hawks were handed over 
to the Afghan Air Force on Saturday, marking the 16th anniversary[9] of the start of the Afghanistan war. The US Air 
Force's B-52 bombers are in for a substantial upgrade, with plans to improve the technical capabilities of all 76 
aircraft in the fleet. The bombers, production of which was completed in 1962, will receive multiple upgrades, 
including digital data-links, moving-map displays and next-generation avionics[10]. The upgrades will allow them to 
operate until at least 2040, for a total of 80 years of service. Irish aviation company Ryanair had to cancel 18,000 
flights[11] between November 2017 and March 2018 because it failed to take pilot leave into account in planning. 
Ryanair claims that it will need at least 600,000 pilots in the next 20 years[12] to keep up with demand. Rapid fire 
European arms manufacturer MBDA has extended its cooperation with Australian companies. Airspeed and Codan 
(both based in South Australia), Pennant Australasia and Pelican Trimcast (Victoria), and Hofmann Engineering 
(Western Australia) joined the cooperation network, which already included Queensland-based Ferra Engineering. 
MBDA has bid for the missile system for the LAND 400 Phase 2 program with its MMP fifth-generation anti-tank 
guided weapon. MBDA aims for the MMP 'to become the first missile that is built, maintained and evolved in 
Australia'[13]. The preliminary results of the Defence Blood Challenge 2017[14] are in! Each year from 1 September 
to 8 December, members of all branches and Defence public servants are called upon to donate, with each group

competing as a team. Last year the army took the title for most donations and, by the looks of it[15], its chances are 
high to defend the titleâ€”so far, 35.61% of donations have come from army members. Zero gravity US vice 
president Mike Pence chaired the first meeting of the National Space Council in nearly 25 years last Thursday[16]. 
The council includes senior civil and military government officials. The vice president used the opportunity to call for 
renewed US leadership in space, and confirmed the Trump administration's support for NASA. Earlier in the week, 
Pence wrote about[17] US ambitions to 'return to the moonâ€”and go beyond' in the Wall Street Journal. On the 
weekend, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly chronicled[18] the physical challenges of returning to earth after a year in 
space for the Sydney Morning Herald. Scott spent 340 days alongside Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko on 
the International Space Station, which is the record for the longest continuous time in space. Scott's body struggled 
to deal with his return to earth. He suffered from extended periods of pain and exhaustion. One of the purposes of 
the mission was to establish the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body. Scott has written a book 
about his experience, Endurance: a year in space, a lifetime of discovery[19]. Last Wednesday marked 60 years 
since the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 launch. Life magazine's 1957 coverage of the launch can be revisited online for 
free[20]. History professor Asif A. Siddiqi also wrote an interesting long read on the subject for The Space 
Review[21]. Wired watchtower At the Council of Australian Governments meeting last Thursday, Prime Minister 
Turnbull and state and territory leaders agreed to establish a facial biometric database[22]. The database is meant 
to give law enforcement agencies[23] access to state and territory driver's licence photos so that they can quickly 
identify potential terror suspects. The announcement has kicked[24] up[25] some[26] fuss[27] about slippery 
slopes[28] and mission creep[29]. The debate about reasonable reach and use is ongoing[30], but there's a risk that 
the question will be settled by default by programmers on a deadline[31]. More information has emerged about the 
US government's decision to ban Kaspersky software, after classified NSA data from a contractor's personal 
computer somehow ended up with Russia's security services via a Kaspersky product. The contractor has been 
heavily criticised, but the jury is still out on Kaspersky's role in the breach[32]. Questions remain about whether 
Kaspersky knew it had NSA data, grabbed it intentionally, provided the data to the Russian government, or was 
itself a victim of Russian government intrusion. Last week, the Australian government launched[33] its International 
Cyber Engagement Strategy[34], which sets out Australia's plan across seven broad pillars[35] to promote and 
protect Australia's interests in cyberspace. You can catch a recording of ASPI's panel discussion with the strategists 
behind it here[36]. [ 1]: http://www.dailypress.com/news/military/dp-nws-submarine-washington-commissioning-

Ryanair chaos turns tables on workers' rights
Ryanair chaos turns tables on workers' rights
Deutsche Welle Business

Oct 09, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  An 
exodus of Ryanair pilots is just the tip of the iceberg as workers fight over diminished rights, say analysts. Amid a 
tightening labor market, companies can expect more trouble ahead.Ryanair's sudden cancellation of some 20,000 
flights this fall and winter due to an apparent shortage of pilots has exposed deep shortcomings in the Irish airline's 
labor relations.The poster child for a changing aviation industry, the budget carrier's rapid expansion has 
challenged traditional players such as Virgin and British Airways and saw the airline achieve record profits of 1.32 
billion euros ($1.55 billion) in 2016 against revenues of 6.54 billion euros.But amid what some analysts say is an 
obsessive drive for efficiency, its pilots and cabin crew are increasingly forced to accept weak employment terms 
and short-term contracts. Many of its air crews are hired on a self-employed basis through agencies, and are often 
only paid for the hours their planes are in the air.Ready to walk"Ryanair has a highly transactional relationship with 
staff and one that is highly precarious for workers, but now also clearly for the airline," Geraint Harvey, a senior 
lecturer in human resources management and industrial relations at the University of Birmingham, told 
DW.According to Harvey, a majority of Ryanair pilots were until recently "questionably self-employed in that they did 
not determine their wage or control their schedule and yet worked for themselves."Read more: Up in the air?
 Ryanair's growing painsUntil now, he added, pilots have been unable to register their discontent because Ryanair 
was one of the few airlines enjoying strong growth figures. But the arrival of competitors including Norwegian Air 
has left it suddenly facing much higher staff turnover.Ryanair doesn't recognize unions, and due to the tremendous 
cost of becoming a pilot, there is a huge financial disincentive for pilots to take strike action, Harvey explained.The 
airline has insisted its winter scheduling debacle, which saw the flights of close to a million passengers cancelled, is 
not about a shortage of pilots.Profits hitThe Ryanair chaos is just one example of the surprise blowback that can hit 
companies that impose increasingly poor labor practices. "Examples from the gig economy show that collectivism is 
alive and well and even in the absence of trade unions, workers will still unite to combat egregious employment 
relations behaviour," said Harvey. The London-based Institute for Employment Rights (IER) said the rise in 
unconventional worker rebellion was inevitable, as UK trade unions have to jump over increasingly high hurdles 
before they can organize lawful strikes. This is a result of a severe weakening of union power that began during 
former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decade in office."UK workers face the most restrictive laws on trade 
unions in the western world. As a result they also have fewer rights, work longer hours and receive lower pensions 
than most workers throughout Europe," Carolyn Jones, the think-tank's director told DW.Companies underestimate 
how a worker exodus can push them to the brink of survival, she warned, and that increasingly, workers are 
prepared to break the law to make their voices heard. She cited the case of prison officers â€” whose contracts 
forbid them from taking strike action â€” but who previously organized stay-at-home "duvet days" to highlight the

increased safety risk in Britain's jails.Unions say the classification of employees as self-employed contractors is 
endemic in the UK, a move which often helps firms avoid paying even the minimum wage and other 
benefits.According to Britain's largest union, Unite, as many as 5.5 million workers are employed on zero-hour 
contracts, where staff are only called into work as and when required. The practise is common place in the retail, 
food and beverage and social care sectors.Workers or serfs?Academics also bemoan a type of working relationship 
that echoes one from medieval times, when a serf (or villein) was bonded to a landlord and paid rent despite being 
guaranteed no income."Neo-villeiny" is best expressed by the thousands of personal trainers who must pay rent for 
the opportunity to attract fitness center clients. Such a business model tends to benefit the gym more than the 
trainer, amid increasing competition for clients and an abundance of new fitness coaches.Some labor rights experts 
point to the rising fortunes of Jeremy Corbyn in Britain, leader of the opposition Labour party, as proof that workers 
are demanding change. Corbyn promised to end zero-hour contracts and repeal restrictive trade union legislation if 
elected at a snap election earlier this year, which helped Labour to undo Prime Minister Theresa May's 
parliamentary majority."Those policies are increasingly popular with the next generation of voters," said the IER's 
Jones, who insisted that governments "have a moral, social and economic duty to ensure that labor relations are 
conducted in a civilized and constructive way."As far as Jones is concerned, more unconventional action by British 
workers is "inevitable" as firms only tend to respond to "wildcat action that hits their profits and reputations.""This 
'free-market' system is now spreading throughout Europe and with the demise in recent years of any concept of 
"social Europe' this is likely to get worse," she warned.

ReleaseChicago, IL - October 9, 2017 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry: Airlines, Part 2, 
including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL[1] - Free Report[2]), United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL[3] - Free 
Report[4]), American Airlines Group (Nasdaq:AAL[5] - Free Report[6]), GOL Linhas (NYSE:GOL[7] - Free 
Report[8]) and Ryanair Holdings (Nasdaq:RYAAY[9] - Free Report[10]).Industry: Airlines, Part 2Link: 
https://www.zacks.com/commentary/131251/airlines-still-worth-considering-here39s-why[11]Even though it is true 
that airline stocks are being confronted with multiple headwinds, all is not lost. There exist a few bright spots that 
still make investment in airline stocks worthwhile. Let's delve into the details.Oil Still Below $55 = Financial 
ProsperityDespite the recent rally, oil prices are still hovering around the $50-a-barrel mark, a long way off the highs 
of mid-2014 when the commodity had traded in excess of $100 a barrel. As fuel costs represent one of the largest 
input costs for airline companies, the lower the oil prices, the better it is for sector participants. Lower oil prices 
imply greater financial well-being for airlines by virtue of massive savings.Financial prosperity is reflected in the fact 
that the likes of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL[12] - Free Report[13]) have hiked their respective dividend payouts this 
year. Carriers have also indulged in share buybacks, which is more proof of their solid financial health.Riding on 
balance sheet strength, some carriers have shelled out impressive amounts to employees as part of their profit-
sharing programs. Additionally, the robust financial health of most domestic carriers has prompted them to invest 
substantially in improving the flying experience for travelers, in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space. 
For example, United Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL[14] - Free 
Report[15]), announced in July the introduction of Boeing 777-300ER service (the airline's latest aircraft type 
featuring the all-new United Polaris business class seats) to additional routes.Carriers are also investing 
substantially toward modernizing their respective fleet. For example, American Airlines Group (Nasdaq:AAL[16] - 
Free Report[17]) invested $1.1 billion in a new aircraft during the second quarter of 2017. In fact, it aims to shell out 
$4.1 billion in the current year for the same purpose. Moreover, carriers like Delta are looking to reduce their debt 
levels based on their financial prosperity.Bullish ReadingsThe global traffic data for July, released by the 
International Air Transport Association ('IATA') raises optimism. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by 
passengers) touched record levels of 84.7% in July. The upside was due to the fact that traffic growth (6.8%) 
outpaced capacity expansion (6.1%) for the month. The favorable load factor reading highlights the fact that 
demand for air travel is strong.Moreover, demand for air freight across the globe witnessed double-digit growth 
Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: Delta Air Lines , United Continental Holdings , American Airlines Group , 
GOL Linhas and Ryanair Holdings
(11.4%) in July. This was, in fact, the fourth month out of five where double-digit demand growth was witnessed. 
The reading is well above the 10-year average growth rate of 3.1%. With growth in demand outpacing capacity 
expansion, the scenario bodes well for airline yields.Traffic growth witnessed by the industry in the first half of 2017 
was the highest in 12 years. Load factor also touched record levels. Additionally, at its 73rd Annual General 
Meeting in Cancun, Mexico, IATA stated that airline companies are expected to be more profitable in 2017 than 
previously expected. IATA now expects global net profit for the industry to come in at $31.4 billion (the earlier 
projection hinted at profits of $29.8 billion for 2017). The bulk of global profits ($15.4 billion) is expected to come 
from the North American region.Traffic data for the first half of 2017 released by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) also highlights the bullish case for carriers based in the 
United States. The BTS data states that a record number of passengers were transported by U.S.-based carriers in 
the period. The reading for load factor was also favorable.Moreover, the busy Labor Day travel period (Aug 30-Sep 
5) for U.S. airlines this year further highlights that demand for air travel remains strong. This bodes well for 
airlines.Other TailwindsHigh labor costs have been hurting bottom-line growth for airlines for quite some time. Even 
though such costs will remain a hindrance, the good news is that the extent of their increase is expected to decline 
with time.For example, American Airlines predicted in September that cost per available seat miles(excluding fuel 
and special Items) the year-over-year growth is likely to be around 3% in the final quarter of 2017. The metric had 
grown by 7.6% and 6.8%, respectively, in the first two quarters of 2017. The year-over-year growth for this measure 
of unit costs is likely to come down further to less than 2% in 2018/19.Latin American carriers like GOL Linhas 
(NYSE:GOL[18] - Free Report[19]) are seeing better times, buoyed by an improved economy. GOL's view for full-
year 2017 is impressive. We expect the company's focus on capacity discipline to result in improvement in yields,

Oct 06, 2017( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  Amid an 
exodus of pilots to competitors, Ryanair has written to cockpit crews offering to boost their pay and conditions. Last 
month the budget airline cancelled 18,000 flights because of a shortage of pilots.Ryanair's outspoken boss Michael 
O' Leary has written to pilots promising to exceed rates of pay offered by its rivals and improve job security, British 
and Irish media reported on Friday.The concession comes after the Irish airline was forced to cancel tens of 
thousands of flights between the end of September and March as it did not have enough standby pilots to ensure 
the smooth operation of its winter schedule.O' Leary's letter, seen by the Reuters news agency, promised 
"significant improvements to your rosters, your pay, your basing, your contracts and your career progression over 
the next 12 months." 
Cockpit crews were also offered a "productivity/loyalty bonus."Pilots were told that Ryanair would "beat" the pay 
and job security offered by fellow budget operators Jet2 and Norwegian Air Shuttle, according to Irish news site 
TheJournal.ie, which also viewed the letter.Read more: Airline staff fume over toxic air on planesThe conditions 
mirror demands made in a letter by pilots last month. While Ryanair does not recognize trade unions, pilots have 
launched web and social media forums in recent months to air their grievances.O' Leary's letter also urged pilots 
not to quit Ryanair for "less financially secure/or Brexit challenged airlines." and suggested that the firm had learned 
from its mistake.The letter even included a graph suggesting that one of its main rivals was in financial trouble.Last 
month's mass cancellations disrupted the travel plans of some 400,000 passengers, and quickly turned into a major 
public relations disaster for Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers. Not only was Ryanair obliged to offer 
compensatation, Britain's aviation regulator forced the carrier to rebook those whose flights were affected on 
alternative airlines.Read more: Brexit, terrorism blamed for collapse of Monarch AirlinesThe airline has seen an 
exodus of pilots in recent months including rival Norwegian, who said some 140 Ryanair pilots had joined this year. 
The Irish pilots' union IALPA says some 700 pilots have left the airline this year, out of a total pilot headcount of 
4,200. O' Leary has repeated stated that his carrier does not have a shortage of pilots.Since the cancellation 
debacle erupted, several former Ryanair pilots have written articles in British newspapers, describing how the Irish 
airline insists that most of its pilots are self-employed rather than staff, doesn't permit contract negotiations, and 
often imposes exhausting work schedules. Ryanair blamed a regulatory change for the crisis, saying it required all 
pilot annual leave be completed by the end of the year.As the furor unfolded last month, O Leary was forced to offer 
pilots a 12,000 pound bonus to forfeit their annual leave to ensure he had adequate cockpit crew. But workers' 
councils suggested most pilots had rejected that offer, marking a low point in relations between pilots and 
management.

year. The Irish pilots' union IALPA says some 700 pilots have left the airline this year, out of a total pilot headcount 
of 4,200. O' Leary has repeated stated that his carrier does not have a shortage of pilots.Since the cancellation 
debacle erupted, several former Ryanair pilots have written articles in British newspapers, describing how the Irish 
airline insists that most of its pilots are self-employed rather than staff, doesn't permit contract negotiations, and 
often imposes exhausting work schedules. Ryanair blamed a regulatory change for the crisis, saying it required all 
pilot annual leave be completed by the end of the year.As the furor unfolded last month, O' Leary was forced to 
offer pilots a 12,000 pound bonus to forfeit their annual leave to ensure he had adequate cockpit crew. But workers' 
councils suggested most pilots had rejected that offer, marking a low point in relations between pilots and 
management.

Oct 06, 2017( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary has written to the airline's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions.The improved conditions 
came after the airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights in recent weeks, the BBC[1] reports. In a letter to 
pilots, Mr O'Leary also apologised for changes that caused disruptions to their rotas and urges them not to leave 
the airline. 
His apology came after he accused the pilots of being 'full of their own self-importance'. But in the letter seen by the 
Irish Independent newspaper[2], he urges pilots to stay with Ryanair 'for a brighter future'. Ryanair has been in 
crisis after the rota changes - brought about to comply with new aviation rules - led to a shortage of pilots because 
the airline failed to plan for enough leave.Flight disruptionsRyanair announced its first wave of 2,100 cancellations 
in the middle of September, after it rearranged pilots' rosters to comply with new aviation rules requiring a change in 
how their flying hours are logged. Towards the end of September it announced 18,000 further flights would be 
cancelled over the winter season. These moves affect more than 700,000 passengers. The airline blamed the flight 
fiasco on its own mistaken decision to force its pilots to take their remaining annual leave before the end of this 
year, rather than by the end of the financial year next March. That left Ryanair without enough pilots to fly all its 
scheduled flights in September and October. But passengers have complained about the short notice of the 
cancellations and the consumer group Which? said Ryanair's compensation information was 'woefully short'[3]. 
Many of the airline's 4,200 pilots had joined unions over the past two weeks over discontent with the disruptions 
caused by the rota changes. Mr O'Leary's letter implored the pilot team not to leave the airline and offered them 
improved terms and working conditions.'Secure employer'The sweeteners included pay increases, loyalty bonus 
payments, improved rotas and better compensation for pilots forced to work away from their home base. Mr 
O'Leary stressed that Ryanair was a 'very secure employer' and he emphasised that the airline's pilots 'are the best 
in the business'. And he asked them not to allow competitor pilots or their unions 'to demean or disparage our 
collective success'. The Ryanair boss also urged the airline's pilots not to join 'one of these less financially secure 
or Brexit-challenged airlines'. Mr O'Leary's letter asked the pilots to take note of 'the recent bankruptcies of Air 
Berlin, Alitalia and Monarch', as well as the difficulties faced by another budget airline, Norwegian Air, which has 
been under pressure to boost its finances. [ 1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41520970 [ 2]:

interceptors were scrambled on Wednesday morning and safely escorted the plane to Stansted Airport near London 
As reproted by BBC[1] Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon fighter jets intercepted[2] a Ryanair flight and diverted it to 
Stansted Airport following a suspected 'hoax' security alert. The service explained that quick reaction alert (QRA)[3] 
Typhoon interceptors were scrambled on Wednesday morning and safely escorted the plane to the airport, near 
London. Flights were temporarily grounded at Stansted but have since resumed. According to Ryanair the flight 
from Kaunas in Lithuania to Luton was diverted 'in line with procedures'. Jonathan Zulberg, one passenger on the 
flight, explained that when passengers boarded the flight they saw fire engines and a police car but were not told 
about a threat being made. He added that the flight was delayed for up to 40 minutes and he was told by a 
stewardess that a bomb threat had been made in Lithuania.

aircraft[5], that are kept on high alert and can take off 'within minutes' from RAF Coningsby[6] and RAF

said. Noteworthy Stansted is a designated airport for dealing with hijacks and major security alerts. Essex Police 
said it had completed investigating the incident and confirmed it had not found anything suspicious. A Ryanair 
spokesman said the plane landed normally and passengers are being transferred to Luton by coach.

deployed two fighter jets to escort a Ryanair flight from Lithuania, after receiving an apparently fake security alert. 
Witnesses reported hearing a sonic boom before the aircraft landed safely in London.Authorities redirected the 
plane, which was originally scheduled to land at London Luton Airport, to Stansted, a nearby airport specially 
designated to deal with hijackings and similar threats.After searching the aircraft, however, Essex police said they 
had "not found anything suspicious" aboard the aircraft and that the incident was "not believed to be a hijack 
situation or terror matter.""The plane landed safely around 8:55 a.m. and passengers were safely brought off," the 
police said.The incident drew attention on social media, as people on the ground noticed two RAF fighter jets 
escorting the plane to its destination and reported sonic booms over southeastern England. 
Twitter user Andy Longhurst shared the photos showing one of the jets behind the Ryanair aircraft."The RAF can 
confirm Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon aircraft were launched this morning from RAF Coningsby to intercept a 
civilian aircraft," the British military said on Wednesday.The planes were authorized to travel "at supersonic speed 
for operational reasons," he added.Read more: EasyJet pilot stops in Cologne after suspicious conversation The

million people in September, 10 per cent more than in the same month in 2016, despite the disruption caused by 
cancelled flights.The airline announced last month that thousands of flights would be cut from schedules in 
September and October, BBC[1] reports. In its statement, Ryanair repeated its apology to those affected by the 
cancellations and said it had refunded or re-accommodated 98 per cent of them. 
It said the other 2 per cent had yet to contact the airline. 'We again sincerely apologise to our customers for these 
deeply regretted cancellations,' said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer. Ryanair also said its planes 
were 97 per cent full in September for the third month running.Regulator furyRyanair announced its first wave of 
2,100 cancellations in the middle of September, after it rearranged pilots' rosters to comply with new aviation rules 
requiring a change in how their flying hours are logged. Towards the end of September it announced 18,000 further 
flights would be cancelled over the winter season. These moves affect more than 700,000 passengers. In the 
airline's first wave of cancellations Ryanair offered affected passengers a Â£40 voucher per cancelled flight as a way 
to say sorry. This was short of European rules governing flight cancellations and passenger rights, and Ryanair was 
eventually forced to bow to regulator demands and spell out the options on offer to affected passengers. Last week, 
Civil Aviation Authority boss, Andrew Haines, said he was 'furious' the airline had not been complying with the law 
by failing to offer to re-route passengers on rival airlines. [ 1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41481931

new version of its CS Markets Index, which tracks trading revenues across Wall Street, and it is not a pretty sight 
for America's top investment banks. In a note out October 3, research analyst Susan Roth Katzke and her team set 
out their expectations for third quarter trading revenues, with Katzke and company forecasting a 15% to 20% 
decline year-over-year. 
That echoes commentary from bank executives, with Citigroup CFO John Gerspach saying the bank was on pace 
for a 15% year-over-year decline in trading revenues[1]. JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon said the bank was on track 
for a 20% decline[2]. The scale of the decline in fixed income, currencies, and commodities revenues is pretty 
brutal. The biggest business in FICC, G10 rates, is forecast down down by as much as 50% versus the same 
period a year earlier. Ouch.The Credit Suisse team also set out their expectations for individual banks, forecasting a 
23% decline in sales and trading revenues across FICC and equities at Goldman Sachs. It's now forecasting a $2 
billion drop in trading revenues at Goldman Sachs from 2016 to 2017.  NOW WATCH: The head of a $55 billion

Oct 02, 2017( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  The UK 
is struggling to repatriate some 110,000 people after the country's Monarch airline stopped operating its flights. The 
government asked the aviation authority to provide planes to transport British citizens home.Britain's Civil Aviation 
Authority (CAA) said it was chartering 30 aircraft to bring back stranded holidaymakers "at no cost to them" on 
Monday. 
First planes, transporting passengers from Ibiza, have already landed in London and Birmingham.Some 110,000 
passengers are believed to be stuck abroad as the UK-based budget Monarch airline announced all of its flights 
and holidays have been "canceled and are no longer operating.""I am truly sorry that it has ended like this," the 
company's CEO Andrew Swaffield told employees in a message. "I am so sorry that thousands now face a 
cancelled holiday or trip, possible delays getting home and huge inconvenience as a result of our failure."The move 
to bring the UK citizens back is the biggest peacetime repatriation effort in British history."This is a hugely 
distressing situation for British holidaymakers abroad - and my first priority is to help them get back to the UK," 
Transport Minister Chris Grayling said. Monarch is the country's fifth biggest airline. It has been struggling 
financially for some time, and received a cash injection last October. It was forced to go into administration after 
failing to reach a deal with government regulators ahead of the Sunday midnight deadline. The disruption comes 
only two weeks after Irish-based Ryanair, Europe's biggest lowcost airline, unexpectedly canceled thousands of 
flights.dj/rt (Reuters, AFP, dpa, AP)

Oct 02, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Terror 
fears and a fall in the British pound after the Brexit vote have been cited as causing the budget airline to go bust. A 
massive operation to repatriate more than 100,000 tourists is underway.Britain's decision to leave the European 
Union is being felt by more than 860,000 British holidaymakers - more than a hundred thousand of them stuck 
abroad - after the collapse of Monarch Airlines on Monday, in what is billed as the largest failure of a UK airline.The 
budget carrier was forced to appoint accountancy firm KPMG as liquidators after Britain's air regulator refused to 
renew Monarch's license to sell holidays that offer advanced consumer protection in the event of the bankruptcy of 
any tourism provider.Aviation analysts said a 20 percent fall in the value of the British pound since the June 2016 
Brexit vote had left the budget airline with an extra bill of 50 million pounds (â‚¬56.6 million, $66.5 million) for aviation 
fuel and the cost of leasing aircraft, which is paid for in dollars.Passengers fell by a quarterCommentators said the 
currency's weakness compounded the airline's troubles after it saw a 19 percent fall in passengers carried in 2015 
at 5.7 million compared to the previous year and passenger numbers fell a further 5 percent in 2016.Tourists stayed 
away from many of Monarch's traditional destinations in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey after much-publicized terrorist 
attacks.The airline's Chief Executive Andrew Swaffield was cited by The Telegraph newspaper as saying that 
despite a recovery in passengers carried in the first half of 2017, the firm was still bringing in 100 million pounds 
less in revenue."Monarch tried to reinvent itself as a low cost airline but was late into an already crowded market 
with this model," aviation analyst John Strickland told DW, referring to major competitors EasyJet and Ryanair who 
both dominate Europe's budget airline sector.Read more:Berlin votes to keep Tegel Airport open Up in the air?
 Ryanair's growing painsStrickland said Monarch had a "loyal following," but the fall in tourism to Middle Eastern 
and North African destinations due to terror fears had led to "over-capacity in other key markets such as Spain," 
where air tickets are have been under intense price pressure.Despite also attempting a longer-term move from 
short-haul to long-haul travel to reduce its losses, the brand was not strong enough "to deliver sustainable profits for 
the long term."Launched in 1968, Monarch initially offered chartered flights to Britain's booming package holiday 
industry before quickly adding regular scheduled flights to Spain, Greece and Turkey to achieve even bigger 
profits.But it has struggled against its more aggressive competitors who have built much bigger brands through 
clever marketing that saw both airlines a regular feature of television docu-soaps that were set in Britain's regional 
airports.No government supportMonday's announcement was quickly rounded upon by opposition politicians and 
unions who blamed the Conservative government of Prime Minister Theresa May for failing to step in with a 
bridging loan to allow the airline to restructure its operations. In August, German budget carrier Air Berlin filed for 
insolvency but remained in the skies due to a â‚¬150-million government loan."The reasons for Monarch's failure ... 
include the lack of confidence caused by the collapse in the pound and the resulting lack of confidence in the 
Brexit, terrorism blamed for collapse of Monarch Airlines
government itself," said Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrat party.The UK's biggest trade union, Unite, said 
another effect of the Brexit vote is the uncertainty over whether British airlines will have unfettered access to 
European skies when the country leaves the EU in 2019. That could have hindered further investment in the failing 
airline, which was bought by private equity firm Greybull Capital in 2014.The British government was "content to sit 
on its hands and allow one of the UK's oldest airlines go into administration," said Oliver Richardson, a spokesman 
for Unite.Help for stranded passengersBritish Transport Secretary Chris Grayling rejected suggestions that the 
referendum result was a factor in the airline's demise, but admitted the collapse was an "unprecedented situation' 
that calls for an "unprecedented response.'Grayling said the government was chartering more than 30 aircraft in 
what's described as the country's "biggest ever peacetime repatriation" to bring customers home. As well as the 
110,000 passengers currently abroad, some 750,000 future Monarch bookings have been canceled.KPMG partner 
Blair Nimmo said administrators are now considering breaking up the company as no buyer has been found for the 
entire airline and tour operator business.The company employs 2,500 people and has operating bases at London 
Luton, London Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds-Bradford airports.Monarch and Air Berlin aren't the 
only two airlines to declare bankcrupty this year. Italy's flagship carrrier AlItalia went into administration in May and 
received a â‚¬600-million bridging loan while it sought a buyer.

Oct 01, 2017( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  Apparently selling 
people something they want at a price they wish to pay is a bad is a bad idea now[1]: But that show of transparency 
shouldn't persuade anyone that this is an aberration rather than a symptom, a visible culmination of the logic of low-
cost economics. Ryanair is a highly efficient business in an industry whose dominant vision is - in a phrase coined 
by the government's airline commission - that 'low-cost is king'.  Unbundling has become part of our world, and not 
just when we fly. It shows up in a host of what are billed as consumer choices, and increasingly in what were once 
public services. 
Effects like this aren't unique to airlines. As consumers, we have been hooked by bargains that come at a cost. 
Ryanair has nurtured the dream of flying to obscure cities for a tenner, because we can. And Uber has encouraged 
a swath of city dwellers to take taxis when before they might have used public transport, Complaints are shrugged 
off by BA bosses: customers want low fares. All of this is being said in those shocked tones of disapproval. As if it's 
just clear and obvious that supplying what people want is a bad idea. When, of course, nothing could be further 
from the truth. This is the entire point and aim of our having an economy in the first place, that people gain what 
they desire, that consumers get as much of what they want as can possibly be supplied to them.  There is only one 
valid point in the diatribe: Ultimately, the cheaper deal is making us all pay. Unbundling doesn't eliminate costs, it 
just makes them external. And they still have to be met by someone, somewhere. Absolutely, and bundling doesn't 
eliminate costs either, it just internalises them and thus forces everyone, whether they wish the extras or not, to pay 
for them. Which is why we like the unbundling of course - so that consumers may indeed select from that menu of 
options. The very thing being complained about is the very thing which we actually desire. [ 1]:

Up in the air? Ryanair 's growing pains
Up in the air? Ryanair's growing pains

Sep 29, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  The low-
cost Irish airline has suffered its most turbulent ever period, with almost a million flight cancellations announced in 
the space of two weeks. But what's behind the drama and can the carrier soar again?If a week is a long time in 
politics, then two weeks has been an eternity in aviation for Ryanair, the low-cost Irish airline that has surely gone 
through the most dramatic fortnight of an already colorful 33-year existence.It started with an email to thousands of 
passengers on September 15 informing them without explanation that their upcoming flight â€” later confirmed to be 
almost 400,000 flights in September and October â€” had been cancelled. Three days later their normally 
irrepressible CEO Michael O'Leary issued a substantial and lesser spotted mea culpa. 
"It is my mess-up. Therefore I have to clean it up."Three days later at the Ryanair AGM, the more abrasive style 
returned. "We are in an era now where the computer does most of the flying," said the billionaire. "They (pilots) are 
very skilled professionals. But are they hard-worked? No."Had the storm been navigated? Not quite. Last Sunday, 
the carrier was trumpeting a one million seat flash sale but by Wednesday (September 27) the turbulence was back 
â€” it was dropping its bid to buy Italian flag carrier Alitalia, being warned about misleading passengers by the UK's 
Civil Aviation Authority and most critically, cancelling another 400,000 flights and suspending 34 routes in the 
November-March period.'The worst situation Ryanair has found itself in'Despite its success over the years, Ryanair 
has attracted its fair share of negative headlines but this episode is drastically different. In his brief as the consumer 
affairs correspondent of The Irish Times newspaper in Dublin, a few miles away from Ryanair's headquarters, 
Conor Pope has followed the remarkable fortunes of the company closely over the years. He has seen it grow from 
being a tiny, provincial loss-maker on the edge of Europe to being, by most metrics, the largest airline in the 
continent and one of the biggest in the world."I would imagine this is possibly the worst situation Ryanair has ever 
found itself in, because whatever you could say about Ryanair in the past, the one thing you could always say was 
it got you from A to B on time and it did it at a fairly low price," he told DW. "That was its unique selling point. They 
may not have done it with a smile, they may have imposed rules that people felt were unfair, they may have had the 
irritating jingle, the lurid yellow color in the cabins, but they always got you from A to B on time. This current crisis 
has blown that out of the water." There are many angles to the Ryanair story, but perhaps the most pressing is the 
issue of passenger rights in the face of the cancellations, a question hundreds of thousands of people across 
Europe and elsewhere are now grappling with. EU law â€” specifically Regulation 261 â€” is clear on the matter and 
Ryanair insists it will comply fully and pay customers whatever they are owed."Airlines operating in the EU need to 
respect European rules," an EU Commission spokesperson told DW. "Thanks to the EU, passengers whose flights 
are cancelled have a comprehensive set of rights (..) it is not for the Commission to comment on operational 
decisions made by airlines but we expect Ryanair to comply with the European rules on passengers' rights."Simply 
Up in the air? Ryanair 's growing pains
not enough pilots?For Ryanair, this goes beyond the loss of a few million in compensation or a share price 
fluctuation. It has done significant reputational damage in an area where, despite other quibbles, it was previously 
unassailable - reliability. It has also halted the airline's seemingly unstoppable growth curve, a wonder of the global 
aviation industry for years. Ryanair has sharply cut its growth estimates for 2018 on the back of the cancellations 
and its pulling of the Alitalia deal shows how the crisis is affecting other aspects of the business.While Ryanair have 
said they will fulfil their obligations to passengers with regard to EU Law 261, they face other legal issues. The UK's 
Civil Aviation Authority has launched enforcement action against them for "persistently misleading passengers" â€” 
this in reference to the manner in which they have communicated details on passenger rights in the wake of the 
cancellations.Ryanair have primarily blamed roster issues for the dramatic series of cancellations. The law in 
Ireland regarding annual vacation time in the aviation industry will change in January 2018 and Ryanair had to 
allocate a full year of vacation time into a nine-month period to comply. Yet many industry insiders have suggested 
that their problem is actually a simple lack of pilots, with Ryanair supposedly struggling to hold onto its pilots in an 
era of increased demand from other markets.For Conor Pope, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. The rostering 
difficulties are real he says, but so too, is the shortage of pilots."It is a pilots' market," he said. "There are more 
airlines, there is more money. More demand is being created with the likes of Norwegian Air, airlines in the Middle 
East and in China. So with more demand, the pilots have greater power. And I'm not sure if Ryanair was fast 
enough to recognise that."Always getting better?As bad as the past fortnight has been, some perspective is 
required. Despite its tendency to attract criticism, Ryanair's growth from a single plane airline in 1985 to the 
European giant it is today has been phenomenal and that success in an exceptionally competitive industry deserves 
praise.Their argument that the ongoing crisis affects a very small percentage of their annual 131 million passengers 
â€” however frustrating it is for those affected â€” is not without truth. Ultimately, Pope sees the crisis as an inevitable 
turning point for an airline whose rapid rate of expansion had to eventually slow as it met its own limits."Maybe the 
success of the airline in the recent past has created unrealistic expectations of what a low cost carrier can do," he 
says."But I think now is maybe time for the airline to take stock and say, what do we need to do to secure our base? 
Do we need to pay our staff more, do we need to pay our crew or pilots more, do we need to treat our staff or 
passengers better and only it can answer those questions. "Yet his instinct says the airline will eventually emerge 
relatively unscathed. "I wouldn't be overly worried if I was a Ryanair shareholder or senior executive because the 
company is still doing phenomenally well. It needs to get over this, to repair the reputational damage it has done. 
But I think you will find that people have very short memories and customers will quickly forget about it."That 
remains to be seen, but what does look certain is that Ryanair will have no option but to remember this crisis and 
learn quickly. Their tagline is "Always getting better": That strident mantra faces its biggest test.

Britain's aviation regulator has given Ryanair a deadline to comply with its demands on dealing with passenger 
complaints following a series of flight cancellations. The Civil Aviation Authority gave the budget airline until 5 p.m. 
(1600 GMT) Friday to issue a press release offering an explanation of how it would help passengers affected by the 
delays. It also demanded a statement on the airline's home-page offering a link to the release.The regulator has 
threatened to take enforcement action after Ryanair scrapped 18,000 more flights in a second round of cancelations 
following the airline's admission that it 'messed up' scheduling of pilot vacations. The aviation agency says Ryanair 
failed to tell customers that it would re-route their travel on other airlines and pay out of pocket expenses resulting 
from cancellations. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1] [ 1]:

Ryanair says it will meet with Britain's Civil Aviation Authority after the agency threatened to take enforcement 
action against the budget carrier for what it described as persistently misleading passengers about flight 
cancelations. The airline said Thursday it would 'fully comply' with whatever requirements the CAA imposes.The 
CAA warning issued Wednesday came after Ryanair scrapped 18,000 more flights in a second round of 
cancelations after the airline 'messed up' the scheduling of pilot vacations. The Dublin-based carrier says 34 routes 
will be suspended from November to March 2018, affecting some 400,000 customers who had already booked 
flights The regulator says Ryanair must ensure customers receive comprehensive information about their rights and

Struggling with a shortage of pilots, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair says it plans to cancel thousands more flights until 
March next year. Hundreds of thousands of travelers are set to be affected.Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair cancelled 
another 18,000 flights on Wednesday and said it plans to fly 25 fewer aircraft during its winter schedule, hitting 
around 400,000 customers until March. 
The move signals a deepening of the cancellations crisis that has afflicted the company since mid-September. In 
addition, Ryanair said it will operate ten fewer aircraft from April 2018. The group said the move would "eliminate all 
risk of further flight cancellations, because slower growth creates lots of spare aircraft and crews across Ryanair's 
86 bases this winter."The latest announcement will affect 34 routes, including London-Belfast and Hamburg-Oslo, 
and slow the Dublin-based airline's growth plans."While over 99 percent of our 129 million customers will not have 
been affected by any cancellations or disruptions, we deeply regret any doubt we caused existing customers ... 
about Ryanair's reliability, or the risk of further cancellations," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.Crew 
shortagesRyanair had already canned 2,100 flights in the six weeks to the end of October as it struggled with 
landing planes on time, reportedly mainly owing to a shortage of pilots. Weather issues and strikes have also 
hampered the airline's performance.Ryanair on Wednesday said it had emailed all passengers hit by the latest 
cancellations, offering them alternative flights or a full refund. There was no immediate indication of how costly to 
Ryanair the latest cancellations would be.The grounding of planes to the end of next month was already set to cost 
the company â‚¬25 million ($30 million) - â‚¬5 million of lost profit and â‚¬20 million in compensation under EU rules - 
O'Leary said.Ryanair is currently scrapping 40 to 50 flights daily - "less than two percent" of its flying program - to 
address problems caused also by air traffic control (ATC) delays, strikes and weather disruption.But the Dublin-
based carrier has admitted that it has been hit also by pilots and cabin crew being forced to take outstanding 
holiday entitlement by the end of the year as part of new company rules. In other developments, Ryanair said it was 
dropping its bid to acquire Italian rival Alitalia.sri/jbh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)

The Cranky Flier

Body
Sep 26, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Welcome back to the second 
half of my interview with Spirit President and CEO Bob Fornaro. (If you missed the first half, here it is[1].) When we 
left off, Bob was talking about how the big guys are trying to be everything to everyone, and how that's not an easy 
thing to do. We pick things back up with Bob talking about how Spirit is focused.Bob Fornaro, President and CEO, 
Spirit Airlines: For us, our focus is on leisure customers. And certainly we want to be more reliable and do it better. 
[We also focus on] small businesses that may be on $70,000 or $80,000 opportunities. Not tens of millions. They 
may have one consulting account, and if they can manage their time and expense there can be some real savings. 
And so that's ultimately our target market, so it does simplify how you approach things. Like I said, when you try to 
complicate it and go for that customer and all these various customers, it becomes fairly difficult to manage at the 
end of the day. Generally speaking from a price-matching perspective, it's hard to control. You can't always control 
which person is getting the fare. The key is, again, what we actually saw after a year of our operational 
improvement program, we saw revenue improvement. Really did. And we saw a deterioration when we had some of 
the [operational] issues in May, but I was surprised.  Cranky: You were surprised how quickly it happened or you 
were surprised there was revenue improvement at all? Bob: I thought for the most part we could reduce our cost 
Cranky: Just by running on time. Bob: Yeah, a lot of people thought running better meant spending money hand 
over first, but you go back our cost of failure is fairly high. We saw some improvement in the marketplace; 6, 8 
months of improvements in doing things. And once you have fewer service failures, then you can actually do the 
right thing because there's fewer people to serve. So much of the stuff we're doing, they weren't money issues. 
They were simple courtesy issues, response issues. For us, we made our problem become the customer's problem. 
And at the end of the day it's not a good place to be in a business that's pretty competitive. I've been on different 
sides of this. Eventually things have a tendency to sort each other out, because I don't underestimate anybody and 
I think it would be a mistake for someone to underestimate us.Cranky: I'm curious on the operational side if you 
have an opinion from a historical perspective. Over in Europe, Ryanair is a stellar operator Bob: Absolutely. Cranky: 
People complain about them but not about being on-time. But none of the carriers developed that way in the US 
initially. If you look at Spirit's origin as [an ultra low cost carrier] or you look at Allegiant, it was always a straight 
'look at our costs' and the operational integrity wasn't there. Do you have a sense of why it developed that way? 
Bob: In 1999 my first year [at AirTran], our operation was horrible. Our on-time performance was about 60 percent. 
Everything was wrong. I think a lot of times in the US, low cost and cheap you know you held back on things. 
Shoestring budgets. A lot of times, people it's just a mindset. You have to spend your money wisely. That's one 
Spirit CEO Bob Fornaro on the Benefits of Operational Improvement (Across the Aisle)
thing I learned in my last job. Most of the things we learned at AirTran, it wasn't about money. It was about learning 
how to manage a hub, which we were number one on bags. We had half our flights in Atlanta and 65 percent 
connecting. We had the best baggage numbers in the business. It wasn't about money, it was about organization. 
We just basically made a decision on our own. It was a reputational credibility thing. We were embarrassed.  We 
knew eventually we'd be a [operational statistics] reporting carrier [to the DOT] in '02 or '03. When we got to '03, we 
didn't like where we were. It helps us in the marketplace as well, because we became very, very consistent. My 
expectations are if there's benefit on the upside I'll take it. But I know you can remove downside and book-away and 
all those things. But word travels fast if you have a bad experience people want to know about it. As you know, 
people talk more about their travel, both good and bad, versus what their accountant does. It just happens to be 
more topical. It's more of a shared experience. Word-of-mouth is pretty important and I also think if you work in the 
company, who would you rather work for? A company that runs well? Our largest workgroups, between pilots and 
flight attendants we have 4,000 people. If you're running well, the job is easier. Cranky: And your crew schedulers 
are happier Bob: Absolutely. It's fairly simple, but if you look at even the legacy carriers a decade ago. Sixty percent 
of the capacity was in bankruptcy. They were taking everything away. When you're failing and you're scared, you do 
a lot of things for the wrong reason. And what you're seeing now all around the industry is saying 'you know what? 
We did that. I guess I understand why, but we don't want to do that any more and we don't have to do that 
anymore.' The point is those guys hit bottom as well. If you go back 5 or 6 years ago, the big guys were always in 
the bottom, even with the networks they have. The people were different and the engagement was different. I've 
kind of watched it myself even in Ft Lauderdale where we're bigger. We had a good year, there's upswing, you 
could see it and feel it. All the experiences were generally positive. If we lost your bag, we were replacing it on the 
spot. Rather than creating this massive effort to not deal with the problem. The people knew what to do.Cranky: 
They just needed to get permission and tools. Bob: Yes, absolutely. So [VP of Consumer Marketing] Bobby 
Schroeter manages this area. He knew what to do. He's always known what to do, but he just needed the license to 
do it. And the biggest debate 'was how fast do we go?' As he would say, if about 70 percent of the things we deal 
with are either tied to a very late flight or cancellation, that's the most important. The complaints aren't that we 
charge for water. Cranky: Sure, I mean I'm sure you get tweets about that, but those aren't the DOT complaints. 
Bob: I ask people 'What are the things we're doing that really don't save us anything fundamentally?' I keep waiting 
for the head of the flight attendants to say 'put water back on the airplane.' No-one wants to do it now because it's 
gotten to the point where why bring it up? We never hear about it. To me, those aren't real costs. Cost are big 
costs. Utilization is either a cost or an opportunity. That's a really big driver. Turning airplanes is a big driver. Or 
maintenance or cancellations, that's where the money needs to go. If those things are right, the other stuff doesn't 
really matter.Cranky: So how you decide where to draw the line on some of these things? For example, and I don't 
know if this is something you're doing today or not, but if you have one flight a day in a market and that cancels, do 
you say 'you can go on the next Spirit flight or get a refund?' Or do you look at other airlines? Bob: We will [look at 
other airlines] if it's our fault. We'll try to give the person an opportunity on us within 24 hours. Otherwise we'll buy 
them a ticket. Cranky: So that's what I'm talking about. How do you make the decision on where to draw the line? At 
some point that can get very expensive. Obviously not as expensive if you're running a good operation. But drawing 
that line between [ultra low cost carrier] and full service, how do you decide? Because what everyone wants is to 
pay nothing and get everything and that's not possible. Bob: So we'll draw the line on something that's controllable 
or not From that point, we tell the truth. We don't try to play games. It is a low fare, but I have to say, where we 
really are moving is generally 'value.' We're not the only ones, but there is a difference between low-fare and being 
cheap. Because the planes are new and we can get people a good experience if [employees] are friendly. I have no 
intention of adjusting pitch. I think our 28 [inches] is just as good as the 30s [inches] out there anyway. And anybody 
can debate that, but I watch people on our airplanes. People have heard our reputation, but they get on and it's a 
brand-spanking new airplane. It's not what they expected. Like I said, we more focused in the past on the cheap 
than the value, and they can be two dramatically different things.Cranky: [I've written that] one of the best values on 
travel domestically is the Big Front Seat. Do you think it's paying for itself by having two seats instead of three? 
Bob: Eventually we'll start selling it at the gate. We already sell it on aircraft if it's open. It will. We do ok there. I 
would have thought we'd have done better, but there's a different customer that's more likely to upgrade at different 
times. I think that should run 100 percent [full]. There's an opportunity there. It is a great deal. I think it is the best 
deal in the business. To get a big seat. To me, the way I view domestic travel, I want my level of comfort and I want 
to be left alone. If I'm doing a Europe personal trip, I'm traveling a little bit differently. That's actually an opportunity 
for us. Cranky: It sounds like there's an opportunity in how you manage the revenue on some of these ancillary 
Spirit CEO Bob Fornaro on the Benefits of Operational Improvement (Across the Aisle)
services [in general]. Bob: And to do some of these things dynamically will help us. A lot of the things we're talking 
about, I can't say these are all breakthroughs. They are things that we're kind of rushing out. We had a false sense 
of security a couple years ago. We operated in this bubble and maybe we thought it would never change but it all 
changed very fast. We're putting stuff into place that you would have liked to have had in place over the last couple 
of years.And that finally ends my coverage of this year's Boyd Conference. Only 11 months until the next one. If you 
missed the first part of the interview, you can find it here[2]. [ 1]: http://crankyflier.com/2017/09/25/spirit-ceo-bob-

Norwegian Connects Passengers To easyJet While Ryanair Backs Away
Norwegian Connects Passengers To easyJet While Ryanair Backs Away
The Cranky Flier

Sep 21, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  I've written a bit about low cost 
carriers trying to find a way to juice revenues through connecting passengers. Ryanair has started selling 
connections[1] on its own aircraft and has begun to sell tickets (not connections) on other airlines. Frontier has 
talked up its ability to connect people[2] in the US. Even London's Gatwick Airport has gotten into the game[3] by 
selling connections between airlines that don't work together. 
Norwegian has been talking about joining the party for some time, and now the plan has finally come to fruition 
through easyJet's new portal. The implementation isn't great, but at this point, Norwegian needs to take what it can 
get. When low cost carriers start, they usually shy away from connecting traffic. The reason? They can fill their 
airplanes with travelers flying nonstop, and that's almost always a better proposition. In general, airlines get better 
revenues on nonstop flights, and their costs are much lower (no transferring bags, dealing with missed connections, 
etc). But as time passes, airlines realize growth opportunities start to dry up and they need more traffic sources to 
keep growing. Connections can provide that boost, and Norwegian needs that desperately. Norwegian has grown 
like a weed over the last couple of years and now flies to, I believe this is correct, 832 cities in the US. It has chosen 
some routes that seem highly unlikely to be able to survive on local traffic alone. It has a ton of aircraft debt, and 
things aren't looking so rosy for the airline. It needs to get some more revenue in the door. For most of the places it 
flies in the US, it can't get a partner to help. JetBlue and Alaska are the only two airlines of substance that like to 
play nice with non-alliance partners, but they can't really do much in most of the airports where Norwegian flies. 
And there is no way a legacy airline is going to provide any assistance to an airline which has done nothing but 
depress fares to crazy low levels. Over in Europe, however, it's a different story. The low cost carriers over there 
like Ryanair and easyJet have become more receptive to taking connections if they can get their fair share of 
revenue. Norwegian is desperate whereas Ryanair and easyJet are not, so those two can negotiate from a position 
of strength. After a lot of talk, easyJet has put up a branded connecting product which it calls 'Worldwide by 
easyJet.' If you've used GatwickConnects, then this will look very familiar. It's powered by the same engine. To 
start, easyJet is feeding Norwegian at, surprise, Gatwick. And the way it works is pretty straightforward but in an 
utterly confusing way. Look at this to see what I mean.I punched in a one way flight from Los Angeles to Berlin on 
October 4 on the Worldwide by easyJet site, the GatwickConnects site, and individually on the easyJet and 
Norwegian sites. What you see is odd since the fares vary, though I assume some of the discrepancy can be 
explained by currency conversion issues. (Though I have no idea why the Norwegian flight is so much cheaper on 
GatwickConnects.) What is clear is this. The connections are simply the sum of two local fares plus an extra 
GatwickConnects fee. This kind of thing seems like a no-brainer. Nothing changes with baggage handling. People 
Norwegian Connects Passengers To easyJet While Ryanair Backs Away
still have to collect their bags and re-check them. There's just a counter in baggage claim to make it easier than 
lugging bags back up to the ticket counter. There is increased liability in that it guarantees that people will be 
reaccommodated if they miss their connections, but considering this service requires a minimum of 2.5 hours on a 
layover, there won't be a ton of those. Besides, I assume that easyJet and Norwegian have no liability there. The 
GatwickConnects fee has to act like insurance, going into a pot of money that gets used in the event that someone 
needs to be rebooked.  Eventually this will be expanded to other connecting points, though I'm not quite sure how 
that will work. Gatwick has been instrumental in pushing this plan forward without the airlines even being involved, 
so it's a natural place to start. I shudder to think how hard it'll be to get something like an Italian airport to cooperate. 
If this is a no-brainer, then why is it that Ryanair has shunned the plan[4]? It's likely not that Ryanair has dismissed 
the idea entirely. It's just that Ryanair doesn't want to do it with Norwegian. For starters, Ryanair's boss Michael 
O'Leary has been quite vocal lately suggesting that Norwegian doesn't have much cash to keep going for much 
longer. If that's the case, then why would Ryanair want to enter into an agreement that would support a big 
competitor on the ropes? (Remember, Norwegian doesn't just have money-losing long-haul routes. It also has a 
short-haul network which adds a ton of capacity within Europe.) Ryanair doesn't need this, but Norwegian likely 
does. If Ryanair thinks Norwegian is on the ropes anyway, then it's smart to not try to help rescue it. But Ryanair 
still knows there is value in connecting people to long-haul airlines in general. It has seen Alaska and JetBlue do it 
in the US with great results. It just has to pick which partners make sense.  As for Norwegian, things don't look 
good, and it's going to be a long, cold winter for the airline, but connections can only improve things. As for easyJet, 
Norwegian is just the start. Whether Norwegian exists in the long run doesn't matter. Connections done right can 
benefit easyJet and any other airline that can find a partner with a complementary network. [ 1]:

Sep 20, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  According to a report 
appearing in the Associated Press[1], Delta Air Lines DAL[2] will no longer operate flights connecting Guam and 
Japan from January, 2018. Lackluster demand for air travel on the route has made it financially unviable for Delta. 
Consequently, the Atlanta, GA-based carrier decided to terminate service. Following Delta's decision, United 
Airlines, which is owned by United Continental Holdings UAL[3], is the sole U.S.- based company to operate flights 
on the route. Apart from United Airlines, Japan Airlines operates flights connecting the U.S. island territory to 
Japan's Narita airport.Is North Korea's Missile Threat Responsible?
The above route had become all the more unfriendly for air travel, thereby denting Delta's profits following North 
Korea's threat to attack Guam. The threat and the resultant tensions had caused low-cost carrier Hong Kong 
Express Airways postpone flights on the Japan-Guam route until next summer. North Korea has, in fact, fired 
couple of missiles over Japan.In fact, Delta's decision to withdraw service deals a further blow to the already 
struggling tourism industry in Guam. Travellers from the Land of the Rising Sun have mostly avoided Guam, 
following the missile threats. This is further substantiated by the fact that Japanese cancellations accounted for 
most of the 7000 + tours to Guam that had been called off in August. The tours were of varying nature ranging from 
educational trips to those for business purposes. The cancellations caused Guam's tourism sector substantial 
losses in August.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/DAL/fundamental/price Delta Air 
Lines, Inc. Price[4] | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote[5] Narita-Saipan Route Still in OperationDelta will reportedly[6] 
continue operating daily flights connecting Narita airport and Saipan. The route is financially viable to Delta due to 
less competition. Saipan is located to Guam's northeast. With the Guam-Narita service scheduled to end early next 
year, it remains to be seen whether the Narita-Saipan route attracts more traffic. Additionally, the company decided 
to continue operating on the Palau-Narita route. Palau is located to the southwest of Guam. Flights will operate 
twice a week on the route.Zacks Rank ...ocks to ConsiderDelta carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-

Sep 19, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  Irish budget carrier 
Ryanair has published details on exactly which of its flights will be canceled between now and the end of October. 
The company is grappling with a severe shortage of pilots on standby.Ryanair on Tuesday posted a full list of flight 
cancellations until October 28th on its website. 
The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said customers, whose flights would be axed, would also receive an 
email to put them in the picture well in advance.The Irish budget carrier is canceling between 40 and 50 flights 
every day over the next six weeks after it admitted to "messing up" its planning of pilot holidays.O'Leary noted that 
some 400,000 passengers would be directly affected by the cancellations, adding that disruptions for them were 
inevitable to provide a better service to the remaining customers.What a messThe carrier is left with a backlog of 
staff leave, resulting in a shortage of pilots on standby.Ryanair stressed it would cancel flights at airports with the 
busiest schedules so it would be in a position to accommodate the bulk of passengers on alternative flights.With the 
introduction of the winter schedule (November 1), the current problems would no longer exist, the carrier 
insisted.Italian newspaper La Repubblica commented Tuesday the cancellations meant a huge dent in Ryanair's 
image, an airline "that had made a religion out of its fight for the lowest possible fares.""But this time around, 
Ryanair had to realize that pilots are hard to get from rivals as these often guarantee better working 
conditions."hg/jd (dpa, AFP)

Sep 19, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Union Pacific 
Corporation UNP[1] is constantly looking to increase efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner. To 
this end, the company revamped its business structure recently.Notably, this railroad operator announced the 
decision to consolidate its six major divisions into four in order to serve its customers in a better manner. The four 
new units are Agricultural Products, Energy, Industrial and Premium.The Agricultural Products division will comprise 
fertilizers in addition to other units like grains functioning under this division. 
The Energy segment will include operations related to Coal (which functioned as a separate business unit 
previously) apart from the frac sand, LPG and petroleum and wind markets.Meanwhile, the Industrial unit will 
consist of the erstwhile Industrial Products business unit. However, the composition of this division is not the same 
as before. While frac sand and wind have been excluded, industrial chemicals, plastics and soda ash, which 
previously belonged to the Chemicals business unit, have been included in the newly formed business unit.In fact, 
the markets that previously fell under the Intermodal and Automotive business units have been clubbed under the 
Premium division as a result of revamping the Marketing ...les organization at Union Pacific.Additionally, the 
company has decided to merge four of its subsidiaries â€” Union Pacific Distribution Services, Streamline, 
ShipCarsNow and Insight Network Logistics â€” into Loup Logistics Company from Nov 1, 2017. Also, Union Pacific 
is changing the name of its National Customer Service Center to Customer Care ...pport with a renewed focus to 
cater to customer needs.In a bid to facilitate customers not served directly by rail, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) 
company is expanding its Economic and Industrial Development team as well. You can see the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[2].Again, Union Pacific recently announced[3] its intention to trim 
its workforce by up to 750 employees for increasing efficiencies.Price PerformanceShares of Union Pacific have 
struggled so far this year. While the stock has gained 9.9%, the industry [4]rallied 19.9%. The company is, however, 
likely to struggle in the third quarter, with Harvey expected to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 
cents per share. Nevertheless, the company aims to mitigate its struggles through the above efforts in the long 
run.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation[5] space may consider Canadian National 
Railway Company CNI[6], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[7] and SkyWest SKYW[8], each holding a Zacks Rank #2

adding to gains seen on Friday when Wall Street set its own record level, while Europe's main stock index opened 
at a six-week high on Monday and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan rose to heights not seen 
since late 2007.  As DB's Jim Reid summarizes the week's key events, this week will be dominated by 3 of the most 
powerful women in the world "and I'm not talking about Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister and Sansa Stark. 
Instead we have our real world version with Mrs Yellen likely to announce the end of Fed reinvestment on 
Wednesday, Mrs Merkel firm favourite with the pollsters to see a big election win on Sunday and Mrs May set to 
outline her latest Brexit vision in Florence on Friday. Of the three, Mrs May's speech is currently the least 
predictable but after a big week for the UK last week (GBPUSD +2.98%, GBPEUR +3.75%, 10yr Gilts +32bps, and 
the November hike probability from 18.4% to 64.5% according to Bloomberg's calculator), Sterling assets are 
seeing some significant volatility at the moment."  Before we get there, however, there is much optimism and the 
Stoxx Europe 600 jumped the most in almost a week as 16 of 19 sectors advanced, rising 0.3% in early trading, the 
highest in almost six weeks. The European rally was led by banks, telecoms and utilities, while travel ...isure shares 
underperform as Ryanair falls after saying it plans to cancel flights amid crew issues. The Stoxx Europe reached its 
highest level since Aug. 8. The FTSE 100, recently hit by a surge in the pound, is up 0.4%. Shares in Ryanair drop 
3.3% after the Irish airline said it will scrap 40 to 50 flights daily for six weeks. Fingerprint sinks 21% after warning 
on its revenue outlook.  Asian equities rose more than a percent, the most in two months, after the record-breaking 
Wall Street session on Friday amid optimism the U.S. will pursue a peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear 
threats. The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index added 1% as of 4:39 p.m. in Hong Kong to trade close to its highest 
level since December 2007. The Philippines benchmark gauge, South Korea's Kospi index and Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng Index are the three biggest gainers Monday with an advance of more than 1 percent each. S.Korea's Kospi 
Global Stocks Storm To New Record High Ahead Of Historic Fed Announcement
index climbed 1.4% and Australia's main gauge was up 0.5% at the close. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong 
gained 1.3% . The Shanghai Composite Index was 0.3% higher. Japan markets are shut for respect-for-the-aged 
day. The Japanese yen fell as much as 0.5 percent to 111.37 per dollar, the weakest in almost eight weeks before 
recoupoing some losses and trading at 111.20 last.  Hong Kong shares rallied Monday as developers were buoyed 
by policy hopes and brokerages gained after China relaxed rules on stock-index futures trading. Hang Seng Index 
jumps 1.3%, most in a month, to close above 28,000 resistance level for first time since Aug. 30 as developers 
extend rally into third day, with China Resources Land Ltd. jumping 7.5% to highest since May 2015; China 
Overseas Land ...vestment Ltd. gains 4.9%. According to Bloomberg, concerns over possible tightening before the 
19th Party Congress has waned after data showed home prices increased in fewer cities in August, reducing the 
probability of more curbs, says Toni Ho, analyst at Rhb Osk Securities Hong Kong Ltd.  U.S. futures also rose after 
equities increased from Australia to Hong Kong. The gains come after the S...00 Index broke through 2,500 for the 
first time on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average chalked another record.  Not all is certain however, as an 
address by President Trump to world leaders at the United Nations on Tuesday, and elections in Germany and New 
Zealand will add extra political uncertainty to the mix this week. But the main event will be the abovementioned Fed 
meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, at which it is virtually guaranteed to take another step toward policy 
normalisation amid what is rapidly becoming a global trend. As a reminder, Canada has already hiked interest rates 
twice in recent months - the last time in a shock move that surprised most traders - while the Bank of England 
shocked many last week by flagging its own coming increases. The European Central Bank is meanwhile expected 
to shed more light on plans to exit its extraordinary stimulus in October.  Political uncertainty also made a surprise 
appearance after sources said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was considering calling a snap election for as 
early as next month to take advantage of his improved approval ratings and disarray in the main opposition party.  
And yet persistently subdued global inflation despite a pick-up in growth remains the 'trillion dollar' question for 
central banks looking to normalize policy, a report from Bank for International Settlements said on Sunday. As such, 
investors are far from convinced the Fed will move on rates again this year, with a December change put at less 
than a 50 percent probability in the futures market.  'It is fair to say that in our recent travels most of the investors 
we have spoken to question not just a December hike, but whether the Fed will hike at all again this cycle,' said 
Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. 'When you press investors on the why, the standard 
reply is the lack of inflationary pressures.'  In any case, overnight the dollar was stronger, reaching an eight-week 
high against the yen, as investors await the widely telegraphed Fed announcement, as oil climbed while safe 
havens continued to slide as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the weekend passed with no new provocation 
by North Korea. Currency traders started the week by adding risk-on positions amid optimism the U.S. will pursue a 
peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear threats; the dollar climbed against the yen as 10-year Treasuries held 
last week's losses in London trading; sterling fell as some investors took money off the table following the pound's 
best week versus the greenback since 2009, while the euro swung between losses and gains as a report cited ECB 
Governing Council member Hansson advocating a 'somewhat broader recalibration' of stimulus.  The U.S. dollar 
rose to an almost eight-week high against yen after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said his country is seeking 
a peaceful outcome to end the nuclear standoff with North Korea, and as Japanese markets were closed for 
holiday. The USD was also supported by 10-year Treasury yields, which rose to the highest level in almost a month 
as bets build for Fed to announce timing of balance-sheet tapering after policy meeting Wednesday, and rising U.S. 
stock futures. The ten falls against almost all major peers as investors expect BOJ to maintain stimulus when it sets 
policy on Thursday; Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he'll decide on calling a snap election after he 
returns from a trip to the U.S., giving the pair a lift on speculation of further continuation of Abenomics.  In rates, 
U.S. Treasury yields jumped a hefty 14 bps last week, but were little changed on Monday, as were most developed 
bond markets. In Europe, the eye-catching move was a sharp slide in Portuguese yields on the country regaining 
an investment grade rating after 5-1/2 years. The yield on 10-year Treasuries gained one basis point to 2.21 
percent, the highest in almost a month. Germany's 10-year yield advanced less than one basis point to 0.44 
percent. Britain's 10-year yield decreased less than one basis point to 1.31 percent, the first retreat in more than a 
week.  U.S. crude oil prices rose above $50 per barrel on Monday and were near last week's multi-month highs as 
the number of U.S. rigs drilling for new production fell and refineries continued to restart after getting knocked out 
by Hurricane Harvey. Talk of monetary tightening and a bounce in the dollar put gold on the defensive. The 
precious metal was off 0.4 percent at $1,314.43 an ounce.  Investors will be keeping a close eye on a speech by 
BOE Governor Mark Carney later on Monday. HSBC sees two more rate hikes by the BoE between now and the 
end of next year. Economic data include NAHB Housing Market Index for September. Houghton Mifflin and

positive after better than expected lending data and a substantial liquidity injection of CNY 300bln by the PBoC, 
although gains across the region were somewhat contained with Japan away for holiday and ahead of key risk 
events including the FOMC this week. The PBOC is said to draft plan for foreign access to the finance sector. As

Reid concludes the overnight wrap  Mondays are the new Fridays. At least they are for me at the moment as being 
back to work allows me to escape from the madhouse at home. One example sums this up. At the moment we put 
the feeding bottles and expressing units in the steriliser case and then in the microwave every 3 hours. This goes 
on at 1000 watts for 6 minutes. We have now done this nearly 200 times in the 3 weeks of having the twins. We do 
it on autopilot and can literally do it in our sleep which we frequently do. So yesterday morning I get home from 
walking Bronte with Maisie to find the microwave on and the contents of it splattering everywhere within in. It only 
had 5 seconds to run, I rushed to turn it off and found that my wife had put her porridge in it and on autopilot left it 
cooking for 6 minutes on 1000 watts. It was absolutely everywhere and glued to the sides. For someone who is very 
switched on this showed how tired she is. She had collapsed on the sofa. My poor wife never did get round to 
eating her breakfast as the twins then demanded to feed again.  This week will be dominated by 3 of the most 
powerful women in the world and I'm not talking about Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister and Sansa Stark. 
Instead we have our real world version with Mrs Yellen likely to announce the end of Fed reinvestment on 
Wednesday, Mrs Merkel firm favourite with the pollsters to see a big election win on Sunday and Mrs May set to 
outline her latest Brexit vision in Florence on Friday. Of the three, Mrs May's speech is currently the least 
predictable but after a big week for the UK last week (GBPUSD +2.98%, GBPEUR +3.75%, 10yr Gilts +32bps, and 
the November hike probability from 18.4% to 64.5% according to Bloomberg's calculator), Sterling assets are 
seeing some significant volatility at the moment.  Indeed bonds generally had a more difficult week than of late on 
the back of stronger than expected US and UK inflation, a hawkish shift from the BoE, a slightly less severe 
hurricane than feared in the US, and haven fatigue when it came to the still tense North Korean situation. Over the 
week, Gilts were clearly the underperformer with yields up c30bp across maturities (2Y: +27bp; 10Y +32bp). To be 
fair, other core bond yields were also up 6-15bp, with UST 10Y (2Y: +12bp; 10Y: +15bp), Bunds (2Y: +6bp; 10Y: 
+12bp) and French OATs (2Y: +7bp; 10Y: +9bp) all higher for the week. Peripheral bonds modestly outperformed, 
in particular Portugal where 10yr bond yields rose only 1bp for the week, likely supported by S... upgrade of its 
sovereign credit rating back to investment grade.  Bonds will probably take a lot of their lead from the Fed this 
week. They have been signalling for some time that reinvestment tapering will be announced at this meeting 
(Wednesday) with our expectations being that it will start on October 1st. Mrs Yellen's press conference and how 
she steers markets on the chances of a December hike will arguably be more important as will the latest dot plot 
changes. For those who have missed it, DB's Peter Hooper has detailed the team's expectations, with particular 
focus on potential changes to the Fed's forecasts, rate expectations in the dot plot, and inflation narrative. He 
expects the Committee will signal, via its economic projections and in Yellen's commentary during the press 
conference, that it still anticipates raising rates one more time this year so long as incoming data are supporting its 
projections for inflation and growth.  As for Mrs Merkel, assuming the polls are correct the main focus post the 
election will be on the composition of the coalition. This is the main area of uncertainty. The process normally takes 
1-2 months but could take longer if negotiations are protracted.  Not to be outdone by that power trio, we also have 
Mr Trump's debut speech (Tuesday morning) at the big UN get together in NY this week. Whilst not likely to be 
immediately market moving, his view on both the UN and America's role in the world are clearly vital issues going 
forward.  This morning in Asia, markets have followed the positive lead from the US and are trading higher as we 
type. The Nikkei is closed for a holiday but the Kospi (+1.06%), Hang Seng (+1.01%), Chinese bourses (up c0.4%) 
Global Stocks Storm To New Record High Ahead Of Historic Fed Announcement
and ASX 200 (+0.54%) are all higher.  Quickly recapping the market's performance on last Friday. The S...dged up 
0.18% to another record new high, closing marginally above 2,500. Elsewhere, both the Dow and the Nasdaq rose 
c0.3%. Within the S...gains were led by the telco sector (+1.78%), partly offset by weakness in health care and 
discretionary consumer sectors. European markets were modestly weaker, with the Stoxx 600 and Dax down 
0.28% and 0.17% respectively, but the FTSE fell more (-1.10%), likely impacted by the more hawkish BOE, 
stronger pound and concerns about the fresh terrorist event on the London Underground.  Moving to currencies, the 
US dollar index fell 0.27% following lower than expected August retail sales figures. Elsewhere, Sterling jumped for 
the second consecutive day, up 1.46% against the Greenback and 1.21% vs. the Euro. In commodities, WTI oil was 
broadly unchanged, while precious metals (Gold -0.72%; Silver -1.16%) and base metals (Copper -0.40%; 
Aluminium -0.70%) fell modestly.  Away from the markets, the BOE's more hawkish message from Thursday was 
further reinforced by the usually dovish Gertjan Vlieghe (a member of the MPC), who in a speech on Friday said 
'The evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when bank rate may 
need to rise'. Elsewhere, the Centre for Economics and Business Research has upgraded the outlook for UK, now 
expecting economic growth of 1.6% (+0.3ppt) and 1.4% (+0.2ppt) in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The cause for the 
upgrade reflects a pickup in manufacturing and that the worst of the consumer spending squeeze has now passed.  
Staying in the UK, British executives from 120 businesses have signed a letter urging PM Theresa May to seek a 
three year transition period after Brexit, warning that failure to secure sufficient time would jeopardize 'our collective 
prosperity'. Turning back to North Korea, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reiterated his preference for a 
diplomatic solution, he noted 'if our diplomatic efforts fails our military option will be the only left.but (let's) be clear, 
we seek a peaceful solution to this'.  Before we take a look at today's calendar, we wrap up with other data releases 
from Friday. In the US, macro data were overall slightly lower than expected. Headline August retail sales fell 0.2% 
mom (vs. +0.1% expected), this coupled with some modest downward revisions has meant through year growth is 
now 3.5% yoy. Core retail sales (ex-auto and gas) were also weaker than expected, down 0.1% mom (vs. +0.3% 
expected). While part of the weakness may have been due to the impacts from Hurricane Harvey, the underlying 
picture is still likely a bit softer nonetheless. Moving along, the August IP was also below market at -0.9% mom (vs. 
+0.1% expected). Core manufacturing output was down 0.3% mom, but according to the Fed's estimates, Hurricane 
Harvey subtracted c0.75pps from both headline and manufacturing output in August, so the underlying performance 
of the manufacturing sector looks a bit stronger this month. Even so, the overall weakness in IP, when combined 
with the retail sales report, means that the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model of Q3 GDP growth was slashed by eight-
tenths to 2.2% saar. Elsewhere, the empire manufacturing survey beat at 24.4 (vs. 18 expected) and the University 
of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was also above market at 95.3 (vs. 95 expected).  Onto the week ahead 
now. Data wise Monday starts with the final reading of the Eurozone's August inflation along with Italy's trade 
balance. Over in the US, there is the NAHB Housing market index and total net TIC flows for July. Onto Tuesday, 
the Eurozone's current account and construction output stats are due. There is also the ZEW survey on economic 
growth for Germany and the Eurozone. Over in the US, there are housing starts, building permits, current account 
balance and the import / export price index. Turning to Wednesday, Germany's August PPI along with the 
Japanese trade balance and exports ...ports stats will be out early in the morning. In the UK, there is the retail sales 
release for August. Over in the US, the main event is the FOMC rate decision along with data on MBA mortgage 
applications and existing home sales. For Thursday,Japan's all industry activity index will be due early in the 
morning along with the BOJ policy rate decision later on. Then the Eurozone's confidence index and ECB's 
economic bulletin is also due. In the UK, data on the Finance loans for housing, private sector and public sector 
borrowing are due. Over in the US, there are numerous data, including: Conference board leading index, 
Philadelphia Fed business index, FHFA house price index, initial jobless claims and continuing claims. Finally on 
Friday, Japan will release data on the buying of Japanese bonds and stocks early in the morning. In France, there 
is the final reading of 2Q GDP and wages. Over in Canada, there is the August inflation and retail sales. Elsewhere, 
the Markit PMIs on services, manufacturing and Composite will be available for the US, Eurozone,Germany and 
France  Onto other events, on Monday, US's lead negotiator on the NAFTA talks will speak and lay out the US's 
priorities. There are also other speakers, including: i) BOE's governor Mark Carney giving a lecture at IMF's 
headquarters, ii) Bank of Canada's deputy governor Timothy Lane, iii) ECB's supervisory board member Angeloni 
speaking at an Italian banking conference, as well as iv) Germany's Merkel and EC President Juncker speaking at 
the 75th birthday of Germany's longest serving finance minister. Moving to Tuesday, there is the general debate of 
the UN general assembly and Germany's Merkel will give a preelection interview to RTL television. Turning to 
Wednesday, there is the FOMC rate decision in the US, followed by Yellen's speech at 14:30 EDT. Elsewhere, EU's 
Global Stocks Storm To New Record High Ahead Of Historic Fed Announcement
Chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier will speak and the OPEC's panel of technical representatives will meet to 
discuss production cuts. Then onto Thursday, there is the BOJ rate decision. Back in Europe, the ECB's Mario 
Draghi will give a welcome address at the European systemic risk board's annual conference in Frankfurt and the 
ECB's Frank Smets will also speak. Finally, on Friday, we have three Fed speakers, including John Williams, Esther 
George and Robert Kaplan. Over in Europe, the ECB's Vice President Constancio will speak and the EU foreign 
ministers will also hold an informal meeting. In the UK, PM Theresa May will give her big speech updating her 
government's position on Brexit. [ 1]:            http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/S7tZdc1J_js/global-

Sep 16, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  One of Europe's largest 
low-cost airlines wants to improve its punctuality. 
But its plan will impact hundreds of thousands of passengers over the next six weeks.Ryanair said Friday it planned 
to cut between 40 and 50 flights per day over the next six weeks to "improve punctuality." The airline's head of 
communications, Robin Kiely, said in statement that the cuts, which will impact between 1,680 and 2,100 flights, 
amount to less than two percent of the airline's flight program.Read more: Ryanair profit slumps on weak pound"We 
apologise sincerely to the small number of customers affected by these cancellations, and will be doing our utmost 
to arrange alternative flgihts and/or full refunds for them," Kiely said.Kiely cited air traffic control (ATC) delays and 
strikes, weather disruption during the summer, and a backlog of crew leave before the end of the year as reasons 
for the decision. These problems "severely reduced our on-time performance over the past two weeks to under 80 
percent," he said.Ryanair offered those affected the option for a refund or to book an alternative flight in emails sent 
on Friday.But the announcement by Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers left many passengers furious. 
Some vented their anger at Ryanair's official Twitter account, with one user calling the decision "outrageous" and 
another user calling it an "absolute disgrace."ap/rg (AFP, Reuters)

Sep 16, 2017( Credit Visionary: http://www.creditvisionary.com Delivered by Newstex)  It seems as though taking a 
trip throughout Europe is like an initiation rite. Whether you're fresh from senior high school, retired, traveling to one 
nation or a number of, it's an impressive location to start your journey as a vagabond. Unfortunately, Europe can 
likewise be exceptionally costly. 
If traveling to Europe gets on your pail listing but you don't quite have the funds to do it, take a look at these 6 tips 
to earn a legendary journey to Europe possible! Work Hard, Play Hard Europe's cost implies you're mosting likely to 
need to save rather a little bit before your trip. Obviously there are means to obtain around Europe without investing 
your life financial savings away (I once satisfied a person that invested just $700 throughout his 3 months in 
Europe, consuming only rice and also sleeping in train terminals to obtain around). Nonetheless I think many of us 
don't prepare to travel like that. This implies it's time to roll of up your sleeves and reach work. Grab added shifts, 
ask your boss for overtime or work with additional tasks. If you can not get any added dough from your day task, 
inspect out these extra means you could generate income on the side! Accrue Those Travel Points I have actually 
claimed it prior to and I'll claim it once again: gathering travel points is just one of the very best means to conserve 
loan for traveling. Of training course, I don't suggest this choice if you can not pay your credit history card bills off 
regular monthly. Nevertheless if you have the ability to responsibly consolidate your financial debt each month, you 
can not only obtain factors from incentive register programs, however you can also accumulate points for every 
buck spent. Point gathering is specifically useful in Europe. You'll be hard-pressed to discover a city that does not 
have a resort chain that makes use of traveling benefit programs. Major cities like London, Paris, Berlin and also 
Stockholm are the home of a few of the ideal hotels on the planet, every one of which you could pay in points. Know 
Where to Obtain the most effective Deal Transportation throughout Europe could be pricey. That's why it is very 
important to know where to find the very best deal. Sure, you may not get as much legroom or enjoy the rough trip, 
however it's Europe, that cares! Megabus Wanderu Skyscanner Ryanair Vueling Rome2Rio com Hostelbookers 
Hostel World Airbnb Hoteltonight Invest in the Right Luggage We all dream we had an old Louis Vuitton trunk full of 
French apparel and ornaments. Tough baggage is a great deal much more tough to travel with. It has the tendency 
to consider extra, it's tough to navigate around rock streets and it can be a battle to pack the ideal amount of 
clothes. If you're traveling for a brief quantity of time, think about a carry-on bag. It will certainly conserve you a 
great deal of luggage charges and you won't be in charge of way too many products. If you're traveling much 
longer, think concerning a backpack! They're less complicated to maneuver through multiple kinds of surface, can 
be cost-effective and do not evaluate as much. Below are some remarkable places to get a backpack:  Osprey

How to Save for a Trip to Europe
holiday accommodation in Prague is very cheap? There are lots of countries in Europe (especially Eastern Europe), 
that is budget plan friendly. Some actually preferred, cost-effective nations consist of Hungary, Czechia, Poland, 
Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Turkey, Croatia and Spain. So make 
a pitstop in Paris and be certain to take a look at London for an evening or 2. However invest some substantial time 
in these countries if you want to conserve a buck. Prepare to Conserve Money When You Arrive If you're not able 
to spend a certain amount beforehand, make certain to maintain a reduced budget plan while you're taking a trip. 
That sounds pretty difficult considering the amount of sites you wish to see and all of the foods you desire to try. 
Attempt some of these tips to make certain you're saving loan on the road! Travel during off-season (or at least 
prevent traveling to Europe in the summer) Use local transport or walk Use Lyft or Uber rather of a taxi Eat at the 
neighborhood dining establishment and split entrees with your traveling companion Try not to consume alcohol as 
well much alcohol Get a neighborhood SIM card as well as phone instead of paying for data Travel by night on a 
train (that means you can save at the very least one night of holiday accommodation) Couchsurf or stay in a hostel

Sep 15, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  The insolvent German 
airline faces its moment of truth on Friday as a fierce bidding war closes. Wildcat strikes by pilots have complicated 
talks on the break-up of what was once Germany's second largest carrier.On the radar of potential buyers are some 
8,500 employees, 140 aircraft and a string of precious take-off and landing slots at German airports. They have until 
12:00 GMT to submit offers, with "concrete decisions" expected from management no later than September 
25.Lufthansa is seen in pole position to acquire large parts of Air Berlin, which will be broken up after German 
Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries declared that no single company would be able to by the airline "for competition 
reason." 
Lufthansa, the German flagship carrier, already leases 38 aircraft from Air Berlin, and could be interested in up to 
90, according to media reports.Air Berlin carried 36 million passengers in 2016 but has long struggled for survival, 
booking losses amounting to 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) over the past two years. After main shareholder Etihad 
Airways withdrew its financial support in mid-August, the airline triggered bankruptcy proceedings and gave 
potential buyers a month to submit offers for its assets.Accusations flying as bidding heats upCompetitors in the 
bidding have accused Lufthansa of seeking a monopoly over the German skies with the help of German state 
authorities. Most outspoken in this was Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ireland's low-cost carrier Ryanair, 
who called a stormy Berlin press conference to denounce a German "stitch-up" in favor of Lufthansa.As Ryanair 
announced it would not join in the bidding, a number of other investors have stepped up to the plate including 
former Formula One racing champion Niki Lauda. On Wednesday, he announced a bid with Thomas Cook to buy 
38 Air Berlin planes, along with those belonging to the airline's low-cost subsidiary that bears his first name.Read 
more: Fall of Air Berlin needed for further consolidationMeanwhile, Bavarian aviation investor Hans Rudolf Woehrl 
has already published a 500-million-euro offer to buy Air Berlin as a whole and invited his rivals to team up with him 
on the offer. In addition, Jonathan Pang, the Chinese owner of Parchim cargo airport in northeast Germany, and 
Utz Claassen, the former head of German power supplier EnBW are also said to be weighing a bid, although 
analysts give all three of them only slim chances in the race.EasyJet and tourism operator TUI complete the list of 
prospective suitors with whom Air Berlin CEO Thomas Winkelmann has held talks recently.Pilots step into the 
frayCarve-up negotiations were further complicated by a wildcat strike at Air Berlin this week, in which more than 
200 pilots suddenly called in sick grounding some 300 flights and leaving more than 10,000 passengers 
stranded.Germany's services sector union Verdi expressed solidarity with the protest action, saying the talks only 
focused on economic interests and ignored the future of the airline's employees.But Air Berlin CEO Winkelmann 
said the pilots were "playing with fire" with their protest, which had cost the company "several million 
euros."Meanwhile, the insolvent airline Air Berlin announced it was scrapping more long-haul flights to reduce costs 
Last call for bidders on bankrupt Air Berlin
while it seeks investors. The routes to destinations in places such as Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and 
the Antilles would end from September 25, the carrier said Monday. Last week, Air Berlin already said it was 
dropping flights from Berlin to New York and Miami, and from Dusseldorf to Orlando as of September 25.Air Berlin 
flights are only kept in the air thanks to an emergency loan from the German government to the tune of 150 million 
euros. The funding, expected to lasting for three months, is intended to avoid a situation where millions of German 
holidaymakers end up being stranded abroad.uhe/tr (AFP, dpa, Reuters)

they are based in, not that of the airline, the European Union top court ruled on Thursday, dealing the low-
cost airline a setback. Ryanair lost today an EU court battle in which the airline had sought to continue imposing 
business-friendly Irish labor laws on cabin crew working elsewhere in Europe. 
The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled in favor of cabin crew based at the Irish carrier's Charleroi 
airport base in Belgium. The employees took the airline to a local court, believing Belgian law would be more 
favorable to them. Ryanair argued that Irish law applied to their Irish contracts. 'The Court points out first of all that, 
as regards disputes related to employment contracts, the European rules concerning jurisdiction are aimed at 
protecting the weaker party,' the Luxembourg-based ECJ said in a statement. 'Those rules enable inter alia an 
employee to sue his employer before the courts which he regards as closest to this interests,' it said. The ruling will 
come as a relief to cabin crew in Europe who are unsure what laws apply to them. The crew involved in the case 
had employment contracts drawn up under Irish law which said their work was to be regarded as being carried out 
in Ireland since they were working on Irish-registered aircraft. But Charleroi airport in southern Belgium was 
designated as their base, meaning they started and ended their working days there and had to reside within an hour 
of that airport. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn

Sep 14, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of JetBlue 
Airways Corporation JBLU[1] declined 2.2% to close the trading session at $19.35 on Sep 13, following the release 
of its traffic report for the month of August.Traffic â€” measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) â€” improved 5% 
year over year to 4.42 billion. Also, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 5.4% to 5.08 
billion on a year-over-year basis.On the contrary, load factor or percentage of seats decreased 30 basis points 
(bps) to 87.1% in August as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth. This disappointed investors, thus leading to 
the stock price depreciation.Moreover, the company registered a completion factor (system wide) of 97.8% in 
August with 68.1% flights on schedule. 
On a year-to-date basis, this Long Island City, NY-based carrier posted a 4.6% rise in RPMs while ASMs rose 
4.8%,. However, load factor fell 10 bps year over year to 85.3%.Meanwhile, JetBlue maintains its projection for 
revenue per available seat mile (RASM) in the third quarter of 2017 in the band of -1% to +1% (on a year-over-year 
basis). The view is not inclusive of the impact from Irma. The airline intends to provide an update on the impact of 
Irma on its operations shortly.In fact, we fear that the impact of the natural calamity on the stock will be anything but 
minimal because it has significant exposure to Florida with two hubs in the state, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. The 
company also has a hub in Puerto Rico.  Price PerformanceJetBlue has been hurt by multiple headwinds like high 
costs apart from the recent natural calamities. Consequently, the stock has underperformed its industry[2] on a 
year-to-date basis. The stock has declined 13.7%, as against its industry's rally of 11.4% so far this year.The 
decline in August load factor is a further setback for the stock.Zacks Rank ...ocks to ConsiderJetBlue carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the airline space include Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], SkyWest Inc. 
SKYW[4] and GOL Linhas AÃ©reas Inteligentes S.A. GOL[5], each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the

Fall of Air Berlin needed for further consolidation
Fall of Air Berlin needed for further consolidation
Deutsche Welle Business

Sep 13, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  There are still too many 
aviation competitors in the skies over Europe. A looming carve-up of Germany's second-largest and insolvent 
carrier, Air Berlin, is pointing to even more consolidation in the sector.It was on August 15, 2017 when near a gate 
at Zurich-Kloten airport an important figure from Lufthansa, notably the CEO of subsidiary Swiss, Thomas KlÃ¼hr, 
focused his thoughts on the European aviation market."Overcapacities in Europe are just too big; consolidation has 
to go on," he demanded. Just an hour later, we learned about Air Berlin having filed for bankruptcy protection in a 
move that's bound to lead to more consolidation in the market.Only next week will we know for certain whether 
Germany's second-largest airline will be sold as a complete entity which is rather unlikely. 
Or whether important assets like routes, crews and leased planes will be absorbed across the various bidders. The 
most likely scenario is that Lufthansa, alongside easyJet and possibly Condor, will secure the bulk of the assets 
which would also mean that Air Berlin as a trademark would disappear."All forms of consolidation are good," said 
Lufthansa Chief Financial Officer Ulrik Svensson. The European market is very fragmented, and so is the airline 
market in general." The US serves as an example for current consolidation efforts. There, the number of big carriers 
has gone down from nine to four within a few years."If you look at what's happened in the US, you'll have to 
conclude that it helped the sector a lot," Svensson added. "That's why I do believe that current developments in 
Europe are also a positive sign."Air Berlin in good companyAir Berlin is not the only case in point â€” Alitalia isn't 
doing any better, with bidders now also fighting for its assets after its investor Etihad pulled the plug on more 
funding. Rivals such as Ryanair are interested in securing some assets and improve their market position in Italy.It's 
difficult to predict whether Alitalia as a brand will vanish into thin air. The carrier has been extremely resilient so far 
despite decades of losses, disappointments, sales and new beginnings. The aviation industry is booming. And even 
unprofitable companies are doing OK because of low fuel prices and a strong euro.Analysts from London-based 
Liberum say such factors could extend the current short-time boom a bit more. "But we reckon that short-term 
income trends are only hiding underlying challenges for many airlines."Right now, there are five big competitors in 
Europe â€” Lufthansa, IAG (British Airways and Iberia), Air France-KLM plus budget airlines Ryanair and easyJet. 
These will also be the big players in future. But then there are a number of smaller, mostly state-run carriers, which 
will not be able to survive on their own. Among them are SAS, TAP Air Portugal, LOT, Tarom, Air Malta, Finnair, 
Czech Airlines and Luxair. All of those are potential candidates for takeovers and mergers. But they are hardly ever 
lucrative partners for bigger competitors as they come with big debt loads and expensive collective bargaining 
agreements.On the alertAt the same time, the big five cannot ignore the trends and offers coming from budget 
airlines. Over a third of all flights in Europe is provided by the low-cost segment. Air Berlin failed to position itself 
firmly in that market while trying to serve everyone's interests.Inner-European routes will be operated in the future 
Fall of Air Berlin needed for further consolidation
almost exclusively by budget airlines, which will also increasingly transport passengers to their connecting flights 
with larger carriers. Oftentimes, big airlines have a low-budget subsidiary to do that job for them.Lufthansa has 
Eurowings, IAG has Vueling, and Air France-KLM can resort to Transavia and HOP and soon Joon which is to 
target millennials and will fly to Berlin, Lisbon, Barcelona and other cities high on the agenda of its potential 
passengers.Let's not forget the insecurity the market is feeling over Brexit. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has 
warned that there's a real risk that some airlines may no longer be able to operate routes starting or ending in the 
UK.Germany's Lufthansa could emerge as the big winner in the wake of Air Berlin's insolvency and Britain's exit 
from the European Union. Lufthansa shares have been soaring in recent weeks."With Brexit at hand, Frankfurt is 
bound to profit most among the big European aviation hubs," Ulrik Svensson rejoiced. "And this will help Lufthansa, 
with Frankfurt being our focus."

Ryanair Introduces a Thoughtful and Fair Carry-On Bag Fee
Ryanair Introduces a Thoughtful and Fair Carry-On Bag Fee
The Cranky Flier
September 7, 2017 Thursday 11:49 AM EST
Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved
Length: 824 words
Byline: CF
Body
Sep 07, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Maybe it's just that we're used 
to having fees slapped on haphazardly here in the US, but I find Ryanair's effort to effectively introduce a carry-on 
bag fee quite refreshing. Instead of following the legacy US airline path of 'no carry-ons allowed' for Basic Economy 
or putting on a high fee to bring one onboard like ULCCs in the US, Ryanair has instead done something thoughtful 
that even comes with some traveler benefits. If only we had that kind of ULCC here in the US. 
Carry-on bag allowance has historically involved two things. First, you get your normal carry-on bag which can be 
up to a mid-sized roller. Second, there's the mythical 'personal item' which is supposed to be a briefcase, laptop, 
purse, or European carry-all. As long as it's small and fits under the seat, you should be good to go. In the US, the 
personal item is still protected. You can bring one of those for free on any airline, but it's the larger carry-on that has 
started incurring fees (or banned outright in the case of Basic Economy). In Europe, however, it's gone the opposite 
way. Wizz is doing away with its fee for a large carry-on and is instead only allowing a personal item for those who 
have Wizz Priority[1]. EasyJet has done something similar with a personal item only allowed for Plus cardholders, 
full fares, and extra legroom seats[2]. It's in this context that Ryanair decided to go in the opposite direction. 
Beginning on November 1, every Ryanair customer can continue to bring on a personal item for free, but only those 
with Priority Boarding can bring on a standard carry-on. Here's the full rundown of the change[3]. Customers with 
Priority Boarding can bring a carry-on bag. This is usually â‚¬/Â£5 per flight at time of booking or it's included with 
some fare bundles. All customers can still bring on a personal item. For checked bags, the standard allowance will 
rise from 15kg (~33 lbs) to 20kg (~44 lbs) and the price will drop from â‚¬/Â£35 to â‚¬/Â£25 per flight. If you have a bag 
that is considered carry-on size and you bring it through security even though your ticket doesn't allow a carry-on, 
Ryanair will check it for free at the gate. According to Ryanair, this is going to cost the airline â‚¬50 million in bag 
fees, so, uh, why do it? Well, the press release says it well. As too many customers are availing of Ryanair's 
improved 2 free carry-on bags service, and with high load factors (97% in August) there is not enough overhead 
cabin space for this volume of carry-on bags, which is causing boarding/flight delays. Normally in the US, we'd just 
assume this is a lie and is bound to simply be a money-grab, but in this case, I think there is truth to this. By tying it 
to Priority Boarding, Ryanair can board those people first and let them get their overhead bin space. For everyone 
else, it will be easy to spot bags that need to be checked (for free, remember) and then get people onboard more 
quickly without the hassle of checking bags after finding there isn't any space onboard.  Will this improve the 
operation? Yes. And it should make for a nicer experience onboard since there won't be jockeying for bin space. 
And while Ryanair may lose bag fees in the short-run, it's also creating some real revenue opportunities here. 
Priority boarding may only be $6 or $7 a flight, but it probably wasn't nearly as important as it will be now that the 
Ryanair Introduces a Thoughtful and Fair Carry-On Bag Fee
carry-on bag's ability to sit in the bin depends on it. I would expect much higher uptake of the Priority Boarding 
product. If demand is really strong, then Ryanair can always increase the cost of Priority Boarding. That's a 
potential future benefit since Priority Boarding itself should be more desirable and can command a higher price. The 
value of the bundles immediately increases. People who wanted a checked bag and a seat assignment but didn't 
care about getting on the airplane first may feel differently now. I would bet we'll see increased upsell. The 
disincentive to carry on bags plus the reduced cost and increased allowance of a checked bag may get people to 
re-pack into a larger checked bag and one personal item instead of a carry-on and one personal item. This should 
result in more checked bags. The expected increase in revenue plus the operational improvement and efficiency is 
likely to eventually pay for the cost of lowering checked bag fees. So yes, Ryanair is being a bit disingenuous 
saying that it's losing â‚¬50 million in bag fees, but really, why not get the marketing bump from that if you can? 
Overall, this is a great way to implement a carry-on fee. I wish US carriers would take note. [ 1]:

Sep 06, 2017( JonathanTurley.org: http://jonathanturley.org Delivered by Newstex)  I have previously written about 
the myth created by TSA[1] that jokes at an airport security point about bombs constitute a crime. In an odd twist, 
nine men have been thrown off an early-morning Ryanair flight to Madrid after one of them shouted 'Allahu Akbar' 
'as a joke.' However, the phrase simply means 'God is Great.' Nevertheless, the men appear to have thought it was 
funny to use the phrase associated with terrorist attacks.  The men were leaving Zaventem airport in Brussels [2]at 
7am when one of them used the phrase. The plane was then held for several hours and all the passengers taken 
off the plane. [3]All the luggage was taken off as the bomb squad and checked by sniffer dogs. Now one of the men 
will be charged with the crime of causing a false bomb scare. However, he never mentioned a bomb and clearly 
indicated at the time that it was a joke. Indeed, it would be rather off for a terrorist to scream Allahu Akbar when 
boarding the plane. Do you feel that such jokes warrant criminal charges? Filed under: Bizarre[4], Criminal law[5],

Sep 06, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, airline 
behemoth Delta Air Lines DAL[1] issued a bleak outlook with respect to passenger unit revenue and operating 
margin for the third quarter of 2017. Spirit Airlines SAVE[2] also unveiled a bearish current-quarter view with respect 
to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) mainly due to the disruptions 
induced by Harvey.Additionally, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] unveiled its London schedule for the summer of 2018 
in the same period. The Irish carrier, however, reiterated its Brexit-related fears.The week also saw a customer-
friendly announcement from Alaska Air Group's ALK[4] subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, because the company aims to 
form a codeshare agreement with Singapore Airlines.As if the disruptions caused by Harvey were not enough, 
Hurricane Irma has offered a fresh challenge to the airline companies. In fact, this latest natural calamity already 
resulted in cancellation of multiple flights to Caribbean cities.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
declined almost 1% at $105.06 over the past week, which was a day short on trading owing to the Labor Day 
holiday on Sep 4.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return             https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-
rank/industry/transportation-airline-246Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return[5] (Read the last Airline Stock 
Roundup for Aug 30, 2017[6]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair Holdings unveiled a 
busy London schedule for the summer of 2018, even as it reiterated Brexit-related fears. 
The schedule announced by the low-cost carrier features a record 68 routes. The carrier aims to transport 24.8 
million customers from the three London airports â€” Stansted, Gatwick and Luton (read more: Ryanair Issues 2018 
London Summer Roster Amid Brexit Fears[7]).Meanwhile, the carrier also unveiled impressive traffic numbers for 
August. Traffic climbed 10% and load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 1% to 97% on the back of 
lower air ticket prices.Currently, Ryanair holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].2. Spirit Airlines expects its top line to decline to the tune of 
approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to Harvey. This view takes into account the multiple flights 
cancelled by the company as well as the continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to 
the natural calamity.In the current quarter, the company anticipates TRASM to decline between 7% and 8.5% (the 
previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 2% and 4%). In fact, per the company, 100 basis points of 
the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey. Also, aggressive competitive pricing in its 
key markets contributed to the bleak forecast.On a brighter note, the company revised its unit cost (non-fuel) 
guidance for the current-quarter favorably owing to better operational performance. Spirit Airlines now expects 
adjusted cost per available seat miles (CASM ex-fuel) to decline between 2% and 3% on a year-over-year basis 
Airline Stock Roundup: Delta Trims Q3 PRASM View, Spirit Airlines Ryanair in Focus
(the previous guidance had projected the metric in the band of -1% and +1%).3. Delta reported a 6.9% rise in air 
traffic for August, while capacity expanded 2.7% for the month. Meanwhile, load factor increased 350 basis points 
to 87.9%.However, the carrier has lowered guidance for the third quarter of 2017 citing reasons like higher fuel 
costs and soft yields. Delta now anticipates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to increase in the band of 2-
3%. Previous guidance had called for an increase in the 2.5-4.5% range. Operating margin is expected to improve 
in the range of 16.5-17.5% from the former 18-20% band. The airline, however, raised its outlook for fuel prices per 
gallon from $1.68 to $1.73 from the earlier $1.55 to $1.60 band. The uptick was driven by an increase in market 
price that began in late July.4. Alaska Airlines stated that from Sep 27, members of Alaska Mileage Plan and 
Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer loyalty programs will begin earning miles on the flights. Additionally, the carriers will 
form a codeshare partnership, subject to government approval. Notably, a codeshare deal allows sharing of flights. 
This implies that a passenger can avail any flight operated by either of the companies covered under the 
agreement, irrespective of the flight number (read more: Alaska Air Group Arm-Singapore Airlines Deal to Aid 
Flyers[9]).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 
week and during the last six months.                   The table above shows that all airline stocks barring GOL Linhas 
GOL[10] and Copa Holdings traded in the red in the past week mainly due to the bearish events mentioned above. 
Over the last six months, the sector tracker lost 1.8% due to multiple headwinds like capacity woes, Spain attacks 
and Harvey. Shares of Spirit Airlines depreciated the most (39.4%) during the period.What's Next in the Airline

Sep 05, 2017( New Europe: http://neurope.eu Delivered by Newstex)  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share 
on Google+ Share on LinkedInThe EU's antitrust regulators approved a controversial German state loan to the 
insolvent Air Berlin airline on Monday. Monopoly allegations Low cost carriers Ryanair and Germania filed 
complaints[1] with the German anti-trust regulator last week, while the Irish company also took its case to Brussels. 
The companies object to a â‚¬150 million bridge loan to Air Berlin by the German government that allows the 
company to negotiate its merger with a new company without going into liquidation. They argue that Air Berlin's 
insolvency and the bridge loan amount to a ploy that allows Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin without the burden of 
its â‚¬1,2bn debt. Ryanair has withdrawn its interest for a takeover. If Lufthansa is allowed to take over Air Berlin, it 
would consolidate its dominant position in the German market. Air Berlin is the second biggest company in 
Germany and has 140 planes on lease, 38 of whom are currently leased with their crews by Lufthansa. Moreover, 
Air Berlin has slots at airports such as DÃ¼sseldorf, Berlin Tegel, Munich, and Hamburg. EU argument On Monday, 
the EU's regulator embraced the German government's position that the bridge loan allows for the 'orderly wind-
down' of Air Berlin. However, the EU regulator placed stringent conditions on the bridge loan's disbursement, 
demanding that it is paid in weekly installments and only when existing liquidity has been exhausted. Moreover, the 
German government must be repaid or dictate the terms of the wind-down. As for the allegations by Ryanair's CEO 
Michael O'Leary that Germany is pursuing a 'national champion' policy, the German government points to the 
multitude of bidders beyond Lufthansa. As the deadline for an expression of interest for Air Berlin nears closer, 
more bidders are emerging. By September 15, it will become clear whether indeed Lufthansa has the only viable 
bid. Last week it was clear that low-cost EasyJet and Thomas Cook's charter subsidiary Condor are considering a 
bid. Der Spiegel also reported on the interest of businessman Utz Claassen. This week, it appears that Berlin 
businessman Alexander Skora is also considering a bid for Air Berlin's holiday routes, passing long haul routes to 
Lufthansa and EasyJet. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn [ 1]:

Sep 04, 2017( Atlas Shrugs: http://pamelageller.com/# Delivered by Newstex)  Out of control. Nine men have been 
thrown off a Ryanair flight for shouting 'Allahu Akbar.' A wise move. 
Cue terror group CAIR for a multi-million dollar lawsuit for 'hurt feelings' and 'islamophobia.' Who can we sue for the 
millions of unbelievers murdered to the incitement of 'Allahu Akbar'? The Muslims said it was a 'joke,' what a 
savage and sick sense of humor â€” if you believe them, which I don't. They meant to terrorize the flight. 9 men 
thrown off Ryanair flight for shouting 'Allahu Akbar'By RT[1], 2 September 3, 2017: Nine men have been thrown off 
a Ryanair flight for allegedly shouting 'Allahu Akbar' and claiming to carry bombs, which they later said was a 'joke.' 
The group was removed from the Madrid-bound flight before it took off from Zaventem Airport, Brussels early 
Saturday. The airport was targeted by suicide bombers in the Brussels attacks on March 22, 2016, in which 32 
people were killed and over 300 injured Following the disruptive passengers' removal, the Boeing 737-800 was 
briefly evacuated and searched before departing with a two-hour delay around 9:15am local time. Spokesperson for 
the Belgian federal police, Peter De Waele, confirmed the incident to RT.com, and said one man was arrested. 'The 
flight commander refused to take these nine people (a group of friends) after the incident. One of them was a 
foolish joker and called 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is great'),' said De Waele. A spokesperson for Ryanair told RT.com that 
the flight crew requested police assistance 'after a number of passenger became disruptive prior to departure.' 
'Police removed and detained the individuals before the aircraft departed to Madrid. We will not tolerate unruly or 
disruptive behaviour at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one 
priority,' said the airline spokesperson. 'This is now a matter for local police,' the statement concluded. 
Spokesperson for the Halle-Vilvoorde region, Carol Vercarre, said the passenger was presumably under the 
influence of alcohol 'and wanted to make a funny joke.' 'Despite the fact that we suspect that the passenger would 
never perform his threat, we can't take this lightly,' Vercarre added. [ 1]: https://www.rt.com/news/401834-ryanair-

long and short haul aircraft to operate under the Alitalia brand is laughable. I assume this is just Ryanair playing 
mind games. 
My guess? Ryanair just wants to show interest, drive the price up, and then laugh when others get saddled with it. 
Or maybe drive the price up so that nobody is interested and they have to break it up instead. That would be what 
Ryanair would really want - pick at the carcass to get what it wants.Two for the road:Non-flyers will have access to

Bright thought she was "stranded" in Italy. The former 'The Only Way is Essex' star was unable to get back home 
on time after Ryanair allegedly refused to let her and her family board the plane this morning because they'd 
overbooked the flight and there wasn't enough available seats. 
Taking to her Twitter account shortly after receiving the news at the airport, the 27-year-old beauty ranted: "P1. I 
have just arrived at the airport with my family to board the @Ryanair flight from Italy to London. I have been 
informed the flight ..."P2 .. has been overbooked ...can't board. I have a flight to catch tomorrow morning, which I 
have been told I won't make ... stranded ..;"P3 in the airport. This is the second time this has happened to me. 
Completely ruined my trip @Ryanair ...ture plans. (sic)"The blonde babe later added: "Can clearly see @Ryanair 
has been online and still no reply from my tweets. The customer service online is as poor as it is face to face."The 
low-cost airline denied they'd overbooked the flight and later managed to get the star, her mother, stepdad and 
sisters on the flight back to the UK.A spokesperson told the MirrorOnline: "These claims are untrue as this customer 
boarded the aircraft and flew to London with 7 vacant seats. We apologise for any misunderstanding. Our 131m 
customers agree, TOWIRyanair! (sic)."But Lydia still wasn't happy and was even more annoyed when the company 
replied to her on Twitter claiming their records had shown she'd boarded without an "issue."She fumed: "If the flight 
wasn't overbooked, then why wasn't myself and 4 other passengers allocated seat numbers ...evented from 
boarding? "Without an issue!! I wasn't allowed to board the plane until 2 mins before the already delayed flight 
departed. I was pacing the airport."Trying to rearrange transport for my family, looking into new flights ...iting for

on Google+ Share on LinkedInGermany's bailout of the insolvent Air Berlin carrier is being treated as a ploy to 
promote the interests of Lufthansa. Lufthansa is the German national airline owned 60% by institutional investors 
and is considered the biggest in Europe. Taking over the second biggest company in Germany would consolidate 
its dominant position in its home market and give the company and add to its outreach in the Middle East and North 
Africa. 
For the same reason, Air Berlin is treated as a major prize by a number of competitors seeking a bigger sare of the 
German market.Air Berlin's hard landingLufthansa has expressed an interest to integrate Air Berlin as a whole, that 
is, planes, crew, as well as take-off and landing slots at airports such as DÃ¼sseldorf, Berlin Tegel, Munich, and 
Hamburg. Air Berlin's insolvency means that Lufthansa can take over the company without its outstanding debt. Air 
Berlin has not made a profit since 2008 and has amassed an outstanding debt pile to the tune of â‚¬1,2 bn. The 
company was taken over by Etihad in 2011. In April, the Abu Dhabi company provided additional liquidity of â‚¬250 
million and pledged continued support for the company until October 2018. But, the Abu Dhabi company eventually 
backed down. Earlier this month, Etihad withdraw its support as there was no positive prognosis on the company's 
market share and profitability. For many, this was a long overdue decision. Air Berlin passengers in August were 
down 25% compared to the same time last year. A deteriorating level of service has caused delays and the 
company has paid millions in compensation to customers. The German government has now stepped in with a 
â‚¬150 million bridge loan, keeping the company afloat while Lufthansa negotiates a takeover of its 
operations.CompetitionHowever, Lufthansa is hardly the only bidder. Europe's biggest airlines have been making 
their bids for a share in one of Europe's biggest aviation markets. On Wednesday, Ryanair moved to withdraw its 
interest in the company. Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said that Air Berlin's insolvency is a ploy to allow 
Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin without its debt. The low-cost carrier Germania has made similar allegations and 
protests state support of Air Berlin, with whom it has been competing for years for North African and Middle Eastern 
routes. Both low-cost carriers have asked Germany's Federal Cartel Office to investigate the allegations, while the 
Irish low-cost company is taking its case to the European Commission. Ryanair and Germania would like to see Air 
Berlin liquidated, in which case it would be interested to buy specific assets. Air Berlin's insolvency means that 
Lufthansa can take over the company without its outstanding debt. And for Air Berlin insiders and the unions, 
Lufthansa makes the most appealing proposition. Even before Air Berlin declared insolvency, 38 its crewed planes 
were leased by Lufthansa. Weeks before the elections, the trade unions are keen to keep jobs and avoid Ryanair's 
Low-cost carriers argue Air Berlin's insolvency is 'a ploy' to benefit Lufthansa
bid. Across Europe, the Irish company has a reputation for cost-saving by undercutting collective bargaining. Still, 
according to Reuters, Lufthansa will not have an open field. EasyJet and Condor are a still considering a bid. Share

Aug 30, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  As bankrupt Air Berlin 
stares at an uncertain future facing the prospect of being broken up, low-cost airline Ryanair says it doesn't have 
any intention of making an offer to buy the beleaguered carrier.Ryanair was not interested in bidding for the 
insolvent German carrier Air Berlin, said the Dublin-based low-cost airline's CEO, Michael O'Leary, on Wednesday 
in Berlin. But if there was an open and transparent insolvency procedure, O'Leary stressed, he would enter the fray 
to acquire either parts of or the whole of the airline. But this was now not the case, he noted, alleging that it was 
currently a "stitched-up game" played by the German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin.It is an "artificially 
generated insolvency," which had apparently been launched "so that Lufthansa can take over a debt-free Air 
Berlin," O'Leary insisted. 
On Wednesday, Ryanair requested Germany's Federal Cartel Office and the European Commission to investigate 
the "obvious plot" between the federal government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin.Read more: Opinion: Air Berlin break-
up poses challenge to LufthansaAir Berlin, Germany's second largest carrier, filed for bankruptcy protection this 
month after major shareholder Etihad pulled the plug on funding. Air Berlin's planes are currently being kept in the 
air with the carrier's remaining resources, with a controversial 150-million-euro ($177- million) government loan 
expected to arrive soon. But if the money runs out and Air Berlin is grounded, the airport slots go into a pool where 
they will be divided up among airlines.The race is on for interested parties to agree a deal for parts of its business, 
including planes and crew, which would bring access to take-off and landing slots at airports such as DÃ¼sseldorf, 
Berlin Tegel, Munich and Hamburg.Lufthansa favored?Germany's biggest carrier, Lufthansa, which was first to talk 
with Air Berlin, has said it had presented a term-sheet to the insolvent carrier, setting out its interest in taking over 
parts of the Air Berlin group. Lufthansa's proposal for the carve-up of Air Berlin reportedly would see it taking over 
the insolvent carrier's leisure airline unit, Niki, and other planes for a sum in the low hundreds of millions of 
euros.Those aircraft, up to 90, would include 38 crewed planes Lufthansa already leases from Air Berlin.Air Berlin's 
competitors like Ryanair and Germania have criticized the German government's financial assistance for the 
beleaguered carrier, arguing that it is illegal state aid that would unfairly favor Lufthansa to conclude a deal with the 
insolvent German carrier. Germania has also filed a complaint with a regional court in Berlin, asking it to prevent the 
government from paying out the promised loan.Read more: Airlines swoop in on insolvent Air BerlinTrade unions 
and German politicians, however, have come out in support of the government's decision. They have also issued 
statements underlining their preferences when it comes to Air Berlin's future. Berlin Mayor Michael MÃ¼ller has 
clearly expressed his opposition to a potential takeover of Air Berlin by Ryanair, saying in an interview with German 
newspaper Tagesspiegel that the Irish carrier is an "anti-employee company" and that its business model is "early 
capitalist."Consolidation expectedAs the Air Berlin saga heralds a new shake-up in the European airline industry, 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary: We won't bid for Air Berlin
experts warn that unless other carriers cut costs they may meet a similar fate themselves. "The sector will continue 
to consolidate because the business models are in the process of changing," said Stephane Albernhe, managing 
partner at Archery Consulting. "It is an underlying trend in Europe and the United States, where four 'consolidators' 
are in the lead: American, Delta, United and low-cost Southwest."For Europe, consultant Jerome Bouchard at 
Oliver Wyman believes that eventually "there will be an oligopoly centered around Lufthansa, IAG and Air France-
KLM." International Airlines Group is the parent company of British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling.Under 
pressureBefore major consolidation can take place, however, Bouchard believes the airlines need to find a 
business model where they are no longer operating on the brink of bankruptcy. Low-cost Ryanair has soared to 
become Europe's top airline by number of passengers. Fellow budget operators easyJet and Norwegian are also 
major players.While former flag carriers still offer a full range of services on both medium- and long-range flights, 
low-cost airlines offer fewer services and until recently have focused mostly on shorter journeys. The pressure on 
former national carriers will only continue as low-cost airlines push into the long-haul segment, which has until now 
been an area where they enjoyed comfortable profits.With profit margins already tight, airlines are going to have to 
attack their high fixed costs on planes, fuel and labor. Wages are a major competitive drag for former flag carriers. 
For example, the salaries of Air France pilots are 20 to 25 percent higher than those of low-cost easyJet, according 
to industry experts.sri/hg (dpa, AFP, Reuters)

Aug 29, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Here at Zacks, we utilize 
a system that emphasizes earnings estimates and earnings estimate revisions to find high quality stocks that are 
poised to outperform the market over the next one to three months. From 1988 through 2016, our proven Zacks 
Rank system more than doubled the S...00 with an average gain of +25% per year. Nevertheless, like any stock-
rating method, it has its uncertainties. Because it is a short-term system, and because earnings estimate revisions 
can happen erratically, there's really no telling how long a stock will last on our Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list. 
This makes it even more impressive when a stock finds a home on our #1 list and is able to consistently provide 
impressive returns for months. We've operated in a strong bull market for some time now, and despite a few recent 
periods of volatility, the stock market at large remains near its all-time highs. 
However, some stocks have been able to stick out from the rest, including several that have remained a Zacks 
Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for an impressive amount of time. Check out three of these particularly successful Strong Buy 
stocks below: 1. Lam Research Corporation (LRCX[1]) Lam Research is a manufacturer of semiconductor 
processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The stock was given a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy) on April 21, making it the longest-reigning company on the list right now. Since then, LRCX has gained a 
whopping 16.1%, outpacing the S...00's modest 4.2% gain over that same time. Lam Research is also currently 
sporting an 'A' grade in the VGM category of our Style Scores system, which truly underscores its overall 
strength. 2. CAI International (CAI[2]) Shipping container leaser CAI International has been on fire all year, and 
when it was added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on April 22, the stock had already gained 115% in 2017. 
Nevertheless, CAI has soared an additional 60% since being added to the list, and it has showed very little signs of 
stopping. Just today, the stock once again touched a new all-time high. Interestingly enough, CAI is also sporting an 
'A' grade for Value, meaning that it could still be a solid pick for value-minded investors. 3. Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[3] Ryanair was assigned a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on May 17. On that day, shares of the value airliner 
closed at $99.93. Roughly three and a half months later, Ryanair is trading at $114.15 per share, which represents 
a gain of 14.2%â€”well beyond the S...00's gain of just 3.8%. This airline stock is also displaying impressive growth 
prospects, including projected EPS growth of 35% and estimated sales growth of 13% for the current fiscal year, 
which have helped it gain an 'A' grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Want more stock market analysis

Aug 25, 2017( Atlas Shrugs: http://pamelageller.com/# Delivered by Newstex)  He was initially let go, because 
British police decided that his pipe bomb wasn't a working explosive. Not to put too fine a point on it, but even if the 
bomb wasn't working, how could these craven quislings let him go? What happened to reason?
 Logic? Self-preservation? But no worries, the UK police has vowed to capture anyone on social media [1]who 
writes critically of the jihadis. 'Passenger who tried to carry a pipe bomb on to a flight at Manchester Airport is jailed 
for 18 years,' by Keiligh Baker, MailOnline[2], August 23, 2017: A would-be terrorist who attempted to carry a pipe 
bomb on to a flight at Manchester Airport has today been jailed for 18 years. Nadeem Muhammad was jailed at 
Manchester Crown Court for possessing an explosive with intent to endanger life after a pipe bomb was found in his 
hand luggage. Muhammad, 43, was attempting to board a Ryanair flight to Bergamo, Italy, on January 30 when 
security officers found the device, made from batteries, tape, a marker pen and pins. When the object was swabbed 
there was no trace of explosive on the outside and officers did not believe it was a viable device. It was only after 
further forensic examination weeks later that it was found to be dangerous and Muhammad was charged with a 
bomb plot. CCTV shows Muhammad, wearing a dark parka coat and jeans, stroll between crowds of other 
passengers as he gets off a shuttle and walks through the airport's entrance. Muhammad was found guilty of 
possessing explosives with intent to endanger life at Manchester Crown Court. After sentencing, Judge Patrick 
Field QC criticised airport security for making a 'wholly erroneous and potentially dangerous' conclusion that the 
bomb was not viable after it was seized by officers. Judge Field said: 'I cannot have been the only person alarmed 
by some of the evidence in this case and the lack of concern that was expressed that lead members of staff to 
reach a wholly erroneous and dangerous conclusion that that device was not a bomb and was not dangerous. 'As a 
result, one member of staff even put the device into her pocket and tested it in the shoe x-Ray machine. 'It occurred 
to me that by acting in that way she put herself, fellow members of staff and the public at risk. 'When the police 
became involved they too readily accepted an assurance the bomb was not dangerous and an early opportunity to 
arrest the defendant was missed. 'There was risk that he could have escaped justice all together. It was therefore 
as a result of good luck rather than good judgement that this matter came to a satisfactory conclusion. 'In these 
dangerous times there is no room for complacency and I express a hope that security at the airport is subject to a 
thorough review of the highest level.' The judge told Muhammed: 'You carried an improvised explosive device, a 
pipe bomb concealed within the front compartment of your hand luggage to terminal three of Manchester airport. 
'Had you not been intercepted at the airport by security you were undoubtably have carried that bomb onto a plane 
bound for Bergamo were it was to be detonated. 'It included a number of pins that were in no doubt to increase the

harm caused by the explosion. 'If it had exploded it would have had the potential to hurt individuals and danger 
property very close at the time of explosion. 'If detonated in the confines of the cabin in a commercial airliner would 
have posed considerable danger and injuries to those close to the device and therefore this is a very serious and 
grave offence.' The court had heard that airport staff swabbed the device, which was later found to contain 
nitroglycerin, but found no trace of explosive and terminal three security manager Deborah Jeffrey initially put it into 
her pocket. The judge said the situation was 'compounded' by police who accepted the assurance that the device 
was not viable and missed an 'early opportunity' to arrest Muhammad - who was allowed to board a flight to Italy 
five days later and another back to the UK before he was arrested on February 12. Earlier this month a jury reached 
a majority verdict of 10 to two on the charge following 15 hours and 45 minutes of deliberations. During the trial it 
was revealed Muhammad was released shortly after being questioned by counter terrorism officers when the bomb 
was first found. He was then allowed to board another flight to Bergamo, near Milan, five days later. The court also 
heard Muhammad, who was born in Pakistan but had an Italian passport, was planning to detonate the bomb once 
on board the Boeing 737. Muhammad from Bury, Greater Manchester, was questioned by officers from the counter 
terrorism unit but released. He returned to the airport the following day to collect his mobile phone, which had been 
taken by police, and then again on February 5 when he boarded another flight to Italy. It was only on February 8 
when the device was examined by forensics officers that suspicions were raised and the bomb squad was called. [

Aug 24, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of C.H. 
Robinson Worldwide CHRW[1] have struggled this year, underperforming the industry[2] it belongs to. The stock 
has been down 7.3% against its industry rally of 10% on a year-to-date basis. Why the Decline?Last month, the 
company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share in the second quarter 2017. Moreover, the bottom line 
decreased 22% year over year due to higher costs and lackluster performance of the truckload division.Total 
operating expenses increased 8.7% year over year to $391.97 million, resulting in an operating ratio (operating 
expenses as a percentage of net revenue) of 68.3% compared with 60.7% in the year-ago quarter. 
High costs are likely to hurt the bottom line in the near-term as well.In fact, the truckload segment performed 
miserably in the second quarter with segmental net revenues declining 14.3% year over year. Also revenues at the 
intermodal segment decreased 7.9% year over year as the presence of alternative lower cost trucks hurt Intermodal 
opportunities. We remain concerned about the company's high debt levels. The company exited the second quarter 
of 2017 with only $273.2 million of cash and $750 million of long-term debt compared with $500 million recorded at 
the end of 2016. Also, C.H. Robinson is liable to be hurt by adverse foreign exchange movements as it operates 
globally.Certainly Not a Broker FavoriteDownward estimate revisions reflect pessimism in a stock's prospects. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has moved down 11% to 81 cents per share in the last two 
months due to multiple downward revisions. For full-year 2017, the same descended 9% in the identical period to 
$3.25 per share.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to 
be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. In fact, the direction of estimate revisions 
serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Additionally, the stock has an unattractive VGM 
Score[3] of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination 
of these three scores.In ConclusionTaking into account the above-mentioned headwinds and the unfavorable 
readings, we advise investors to get rid of the stock at the moment. Currently, the company's Zacks Rank #5 
(Strong Sell) also suggests the same.Stocks to ConsiderMeanwhile investors interested in the broader 
Transportation [4]space can consider some better-ranked stocks from the same space like SkyWest Inc. SKYW[5], 
Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[6]) and Canadian National Railway Company CNI[7]. All three stocks sport a Zacks 
Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8].SkyWest has seen 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.9% upward over the last 60 days. The 
same at Ryanair climbed 5.6% over the same period.Canadian National has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for current-year earnings being revised 6.3% upward over the last 60 days.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the

Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft (OTCMKTS:DLAKY [3]- Free Report[4]), Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY [5]-

its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. 
Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[9]. Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog: 4 Airline Stocks to Buy 
Amid Ongoing TurbulenceThe twin attacks of terror in Spain late last week hit airline stocks hard. Though the 
European airline stocks bore the brunt, their U.S. counterparts too felt the pinch.In fact, heavyweights like American 
Airlines and Delta Air Lines fell sharply on Aug 17, following the Barcelona attacks. Both stocks currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[10].Twin 
AttacksOn Aug 17, a van went through a crowd of tourists in Barcelona, killing at least 13 and injuring many. Such 
an inhuman act was followed by a second attack in the coastal town of Cambrils, located approximately 120 
kilometers south of Barcelona.Reportedly[11] the five terrorists involved in the Cambrils attacks were shot dead by 
the police. Both the incidents have claimed the lives of at least 14 along with 130 others severely injured. Such acts 
of terrorism affected airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears.In fact, the 
timing of the attacks could not have been worse as the three-month period between June and August has been 
predicted to be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel.According to the forecast by the Airlines for 
America (A4A) in May 2017, approximately 234.1 million passengers will be transported worldwide by U.S. airlines 
in the above-mentioned period, up 4% from the 2016 levels. Notably, air travel projection for summer is of 2.54 
million fliers per day during the said period.Given this backdrop, it is of little wonder that airline stocks shed value on 
the news of the attacks.Buffett's Airline Exposure TrimmedAccording to the 13-F filing by Warren Buffett's Berkshire 
Hathaway in the second quarter, the company reduced its stakes in three major U.S. carriers.Reportedly[12], the 
Omaha, NE-based company reduced its stakes in Delta, American and United Continental by 4.6%, 3.5% and 
2.6%, respectively, on a sequential basis.Moreover, the Oracle of Omaha's investment in low-cost carrier 
Southwest Airlines Co. reportedly[13] remained unchanged.In fact, Buffett is one of the most revered investors of all 
times and his decision to trim investments in three airline heavyweights also points at the fact that all is not well with 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: SkyWest , Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft, Ryanair Holdings and 
Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes
this key sector.High Labor Costs: Major HeadwindWith airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor 
groups, it is of little surprise that costs on this front are increasing, which is limiting bottom-line growth.At American 
Airlines, total operating expenses increased 11.1% year over year in the second quarter to $9.6 billion. Expenses 
pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 12.5%. Consolidated operating costs per available seat miles (CASM), 
excluding special items. also rose 6.8%.The scenario is expected to be similar in the third quarter as well. Delta 
expects non-fuel unit cost (including profit sharing) to increase approximately 4%. Additionally, consolidated cost 
per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is anticipated to increase 5% at American 
Airlines.Capacity Overexpansion: Major ChallengeCapacity-related woes had been plaguing stocks in the airline 
space for quite some time. In fact, the July traffic reports of most carriers have highlighted that such issues might 
resurface. Major carriers like American Airlines, United Continental and JetBlue Airways Corp. have posted declines 
in their respective load factors (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for the same month. The downturn was 
due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth.Generally, carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues 
decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth. While low air fares are favorable for fliers, it is a drag on 
the top lines of carriers with their profits being hurt.Other HeadwindsCarriers like United Continental, American 
Airlines and Spirit Airlines have been laid low by passenger-related issues this year.In fact, Spirit Airlines has issued 
a lackluster guidance with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit 
revenue) for the third quarter. This was mainly due to the dispute with its pilots in May leading to multiple flights 
cancellations, thereby causing passenger harassment. The metric is expected to decline in the band of 2%-4% on a 
year-over-year basis, as well.Moreover, technical glitches have been a great nuisance for carriers. Evidently, the 
likes of Delta and Southwest Airlines have seen their operations being affected by technological problems this year. 
Given that technological infrastructure is a key expense for airlines, the profitability of carriers might be affected in 
the event of such malfunctions, going forward.Price Performance In view of the above headwinds, it is of little 
wonder that the Zacks Airline industry[14] underperformed the broader market in the last three months. The S...00 
Index gained 1.7%, as against the industry's decline of 0.6%.Some Positives RemainAccording to many market 
watchers, the impact of the terror attacks in Spain is likely to be short-term in nature. This is in keeping with the 
trend that market weakness resulting from such anti-social incidents is usually short lived, especially when the 
frequency of occurrence is rapid as has been the case of late.Notably, the recent forecast by A4A on the upcoming 
Labor Day travel period (Aug 30-Sep 5) has highlighted the fact that U.S. carriers will make hay during the period 
with approximately 16.1 million passengers expected to avail services of the U.S. airlines. Travel demand is 
projected to increase 5% on the back of low air fares and improving disposable income. The improving unit revenue 
scenario is another positive for airlines.Furthermore, the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 50 (out of 265 groups) 
carried by the 22-member Airline industry highlights the fact that there are still reasons to be positive on the sector 
despite some hiccups. In fact, the airline industry falls under the broader Transportation[15] sector (one of 16 Zacks 
Sectors). The favorable rank places the companies in the top 20% of the Zacks industries.We put our X industries 
(all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half 
(the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half 
beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry Rank[16]How to 
Pick Winners?The above commentary clearly reflects that despite headwinds all is not lost for airline stocks and 
there exists few hidden gems in the space which investors can unearth. In fact, the stocks have the potential to 
generate handsome returns.However, given the vastness of the airline space, it is by no means an easy task to 
identify the few bright spots. We have utilized our Zacks Stock Screener[17] to pinpoint such stocks. The Zacks

Aug 23, 2017( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  LONDON (AP) â€” A 
man who arrived at a British airport for a flight with a pipe bomb in his hand luggage has been sentenced to 18 
years in prison. Manchester Airport security staff found the device inside Nadeem Muhammad's bag on Jan. 30. It 
contained gunpowder and batteries inside a marker pen tube.The 43-year-old denied wrongdoing, saying the bomb 
must have been planted by someone else. But prosecutors said he planned to detonate it during a Ryanair flight to 
Italy. He was convicted this month of possessing explosives. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 
weeks.[1]Sentencing Muhammad Wednesday, judge Patrick Field criticized airport staff for making a 'wholly 
erroneous and potentially dangerous' conclusion that the bomb wasn't viable. Muhammad wasn't arrested when he 
was initially stopped, and was allowed to fly to Italy several days later. [ 1]:

Aug 17, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Play Video[1] When oil 
prices were low and the US dollar was riding high, Airplane stocks were soaring. Over the last year, the industry 
has returned 10.6%. Lagging well behind the rest of the airline industry, down 33.9% YTD, is today's Bear of the 
Day, Spirit Airlines (SAVE). Spirit Airlines, Inc. provides low-fare airline services. As of February 7, 2017, it operated 
approximately 420 daily flights to 59 destinations in the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. As of 
December 31, 2016, the company had a fleet of 95 Airbus single-aisle aircraft comprising 29 A319s, 45 A320ceos, 
5 A320neos, and 16 A321ceos. It offers tickets through its call centers and airport ticket counters, as well as online 
through            www.spirit.com; and through various third parties, including online, traditional travel agents, and 
electronic global distribution systems.  Spirit Airlines is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) because of multiple earnings 
estimate revisions to the downside. 
Over the last thirty days, eight analysts have dropped their EPS estimates for the current year while seven analysts 
have dropped their estimates for next year. The overall impact has cut down the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 
current year from $4.21 to $3.68. Next year's consensus has plummeted from $4.88 to $4.26. Based on these 
revisions, the current year EPS is slated to contract 10.82%.That's the bad news, the good news is that next year 
the company should return to EPS growth, with 15.57% year-over-year numbers projected. Revenue growth this 
year should come in around 15.86% in the face of the EPS contraction.Not enough to convince investors to support 
the current share price though. After failing to break through the $60 level in May 2017 shares have been in a 
freefall. Following the most recent earnings report shares have gapped down and sold off under $40. The 50-day 
moving average looms above as overhead resistance around $48.Investors looking for other ideas within the 
airlines industry should look at Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks Delta Airlines (DAL), Deutsche Lufthansa 
(DLAKY), Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), and SkyWest (SKYW). The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it 
generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed 
investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaries," but that should still leave plenty of money for 
regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>[2] Want the

Aug 17, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  Air Berlin's filing for 
insolvency after Etihad withdrew its financial support has created an uncertain future. Staff and clients, including 
Berlin's new BER airport, face an anxious few months.Only a federal government loan of 150 million euros ($175.4 
million) saved Air Berlin and its daughter company Niki from the embarrassment of having to cease flights with 
immediate effect.The bridging loan should ease some of the immediate pressure on the company, which was once 
Germany's second biggest airline after Lufthansa but has run into serious financial difficulties in the ten years since 
it became a public company.With Etihad no longer willing to prop up the beleaguered carrier, Air Berlin looks set to 
be dismantled and divided by Lufthansa, EasyJet or Ryanair, although the latter's CEO Michael O'Leary has 
claimed the deal is "corrupt" as any Lufthansa takeover would create a monopoly.Relocation to FrankfurtAir Berlin's 
pilots and crew seem likely to have the best chance of avoiding redundancy, with the impending takeover likely to 
incorporate the majority of current cabin crew.If Lufthansa takes Air Berlin under its wing, routes are likely to 
transfer to the company's low-flying subsidiary Eurowings. Such a move would protect many jobs.However, Air 
Berlin's demise could mean a more uncertain future for the 1,200 employees at the Berlin headquarters and the 700 
employees working at the Berlin technology subsidiary.The boss of Germany's services trade union Verdi, Christine 
Behle, is concerned for the futures of these employees. 
"Every possible buyer already has an administration," she said, adding that this would also apply to the airline's 
technology. After the application for insolvency, an initial discussion between the union and the management will be 
held on Friday. "We want to help shape it," Behle announced.However, cabin crew will not be immune from the 
negative effects of a Lufthansa takeover. Lufthansa's Frankfurt base raises the possibility of an enforced relocation 
for staff from Berlin. The worst case scenario is that even long-serving flight attendants would be forced to reapply 
for their jobs, possibly receiving only the starting salary."This would result in up to 40 percent wage loss for some 
flight attendants," explains Christine Behle. In negotiations with Lufthansa, Verdi and cabin crew trade union UFO 
want to ensure that the years of employment of Air Berlin employees are recognized.Further blow to Berlin-
Brandenburg Airport As if Berlin's projected and protracted airport, Berlin-Brandenburg or BER, wasn't mired in 
enough trouble, the news of Air Berlin's emergency landing comes as yet another blow to the airport.Air Berlin is the 
most important customer for the airport company Berlin-Brandenburg (FBB). Almost 30 percent of the flights 
handled in Berlin bear the airline's red and white logo, and the airline had plans to turn BER into its hub, but had to 
drop these plans.There is still a special terminal area for Air Berlin at BER with nine passenger bridges, the so-
called "SÃ¼dpier". An Air Berlin lounge with 200 seats has been waiting empty for guests for years.As yet, Lufthansa 
and Easyjet have shown no interest in creating a hub at BER and the share of passengers who change at BER is 
likely to be smaller if no other airline wants to establish a hub there. And that is a problem for the FBB, because 
Air Berlin insolvency to hit staff and clients
every second euro at BER is to be generated by the shopping malls and catering offers in the terminals. 
Passengers booking direct flights, however, consume significantly less at the airport than passengers who have 
time to walk through the terminal.

Aug 16, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  As Air Berlin faces being 
broken up, a number of other airlines are jostling to buy up the leftovers of what was once Germany's second 
largest carrier. Ryanair seems to prefer staying on the sidelines sulking.A day after Air Berlin had announced it was 
seeking protection from its creditors, Lufthansa was the best-performing European stock, up 4.7 percent in morning 
trading, with budget rivals EasyJet and Ryanair hot on its heels. The jump in European airline stocks was prompted 
by a German government announcement, saying Lufthansa and another airline were in talks to take over some of 
Air Berlin's assets.Lufthansa has made no secret of its interest in taking on more of Air Berlin's business while being 
mindful of the potential obstacles posed by debts and anti-trust issues. 
The German flagship carrier already has a close relationship with its former rival following an agreement last year to 
lease 40 Air Berlin aircraft and crew."Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years and is 
now well placed to cherry-pick those parts of Air Berlin operations that suit it best without buying the whole loss-
making enterprise," said Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation.And Anand Date, analyst at 
Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors that a combined Lufthansa-Air Berlin would have "strong positions" at 
several key airports, including Vienna, DÃ¼sseldorf and Zurich. "It's a very close statement between Lufthansa, Air 
Berlin and the German government, which suggests Lufthansa is in quite a good position with regards to what it 
wants to do with Air Berlin's assets," he added.Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after key 
shareholder Etihad Airways withdrew funding following years of losses, leaving valuable runway slots up for 
grabs.The insolvency comes with thousands of Germans enjoying summer holidays abroad on flights booked with 
the airline. Therefore, the German government has granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to 
allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany 
while negotiations continue.Other contendersBerlin is expecting decisions to result from these negotiations in the 
coming weeks. German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said he did not expect any deal to rescue Air Berlin 
as a complete airline."There is no transfer of Air Berlin as a whole there are parts of the business that will go to 
Lufthansa and there are interested parties for other bits of the business, so we do not expect cartel difficulties," 
Dobrindt saidEasyJet, Europe's second biggest low-cost airline, is understood to be the second carrier in the race 
for Air Berlin assets, according to sources close to the talks."The goal has been to keep out Ryanair," one person 
familiar with the talks told the news agency Reuters. EasyJet would be keen to acquire slots to boost its small 
presence in Germany, where Lufthansa dominates. An EasyJet spokesman said the airline would not comment on 
speculation.Ryanair sulking in the wingsMeanwhile, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, Ireland's Ryanair, is not 
believed to be seeking any part of Air Berlin. The airline even lodged a competition complaint on Tuesday with 
German authorities and the European Commission.It claimed that there was an "obvious conspiracy" between the 
Airlines swoop in on insolvent Air Berlin
German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin to carve up Air Berlin's assets, excluding competitors and ignoring 
EU competition and state aid rules."This is clearly being set up for Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin, which will be in 
breach of all known German and EU competition rules. Now even the German government is supporting this 
Lufthansa-led deal with 150 million euros of state aid. German customers and visitors will suffer higher air fares to 
pay for this Lufthansa monopoly."But the German government justified its intervention on the grounds of Air Berlin's 
"ongoing and positive long-term discussion" with Lufthansa and another, unnamed airline "to continue operations 
under different ownership."But Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) analyst Damian Brewer believes that a Lufthansa 
takeover would indeed mainly be to thwart the likes of Ryanair. "For Lufthansa we see any moves as defensive - 
blocking other more competitive airlines from expanding. Air Berlin's DÃ¼sseldorf airport slots would likely be a 
valuable asset to Lufthansa while freezing new entrants out, unless the German authorities require slots to be 
surrendered to new entrants," he said in a note.While the European Commission said it was in "constructive 
contact' with Germany over the issue, German services sector trade union Verdi has called for as many jobs as 
possible to be saved and for labor representatives to be involved in the talks. Air Berlin had about 8,500 employees 
at the end of last year.uhe/tr (Reuters, AFP, dpa)

budget airline Ryanair has filed a complaint with European Union competition authorities after Air Berlin filed for 
bankruptcy protection and then got a 150 million euro ($177 million) government loan to stay afloat. Ryanair said 
late Tuesday there's 'an obvious conspiracy' between the German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin. The loan 
will help Air Berlin to keep flights running for the next three months, while it is negotiating a possible deal with No. 1 
German airline Lufthansa and another unnamed carrier.Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday after its 
main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, said it would make no more financing available following years of

Civil Aviation Authority statistics showing a 600 percent increase in disruptive incidents between 2012-2016 and

Aug 08, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The International Air 
Transport Association released airline passenger demand metrics for the first month of the summer travel season 
late last week, and the results proved to be strong.However, the airline industry has fluctuated so far this summer. 
So let's take a look at some of the biggest airline stocks as the vital summer travel season nears its end.Traffic 
DataIATA reported global passenger traffic data[1] and demand for June on August 3. The firm announced that 
global passenger demand soared by 7.8% year-over-year based on passenger traffic data. According to previous 
reports, demand rose 7.7% in May.On top of June gains, the industry reached a 12-year high in traffic growth at 
7.9% for the first six months of the year. The industry's first half 80.7% load factor, a full flight measurement, 
reached an all-time high.Overall June capacity, measured in available seat kilometers, rose by 6.5%, while load 
factor gained 1% to 81.9%.'A brighter economic picture and lower airfares are keeping demand for travel strong,' 
IATA's CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement. 
'But as costs rise, this stimulus of lower fares is likely to fade. And uncertainties such as Brexit need to be watched 
carefully. Nonetheless, we still expect 2017 to see above-trend growth.'June airline demand climbed 4.4% in North 
America and capacity rose 4.1%, while load factor grew marginally to 84.5%. Travel to North American was up, but 
travel to and in international destinations rose far more. European airlines traffic jumped 8.8% in June, and the 
region's load factor rose 1.8% to 85.9%, which is the highest overall. Asia-Pacific, Latin American, and African 
airlines' traffic all skyrocketed over 9% in June, with Africa posting the highest jump at 9.9%.With all of this 
increased traffic airline companies must be doing well, right?AirlinesDelta DAL[2], Air France-KLM AFLYY[3], 
Lufthansa DLAKY[4], and Ryanair RYAAY[5] are all currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, and the airline 
transportation industry currently ranks in the top 7% of the 256 different industries that Zacks tracks.U.K. based 
Ryanair rests only slightly below its 52-week and all-time high. Lufthansa currently sits just $1 below its 52-week 
high water mark. However, the airline industry as a whole has suffered since mid-July.Some of the biggest U.S. 
airlines, Southwest LUV[6], United UAL[7], and American Airlines AAL[8], all fell less than 1% on Tuesday as part of 
a growing downward trend. Smaller carriers Spirit SAVE[9], JetBlue JBLU[10], and Hawaiian HA[11] also dipped 
slightly.The US Global Jets ETF JETS[12], which tracks the airline industry as a whole, fell as well. Boeing BA[13] 
stock was also dragged down slightly along with the airline companies.July and August flight metrics won't be 
reported for a while. But June flight demand, traffic, and load increases have not seemed to help airlines at the 
moment. So for now, investors might have to see if airline companies can turn heightened demand into soaring 
stock prices.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming 
investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to

Aug 07, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  In line with an 
announcement made earlier this month, Italy's troubled carrier Alitalia is starting a full-scale tender process in the 
hope of finding a suitable buyer. The airline filed for insolvency in May.Italy's bankrupt airline Alitalia is to launch a 
bidding process Monday as it looks for binding offers from potential buyers.The carrier collapsed into administration 
on May 2 after its employees flatly refused a large-scale restructuring scheme involving wage cuts and 
layoffs.Alitalia reported earlier this month it would solicit offers from August 7 until October 2 at the latest. 
It said those interested could make an offer either for the entire airline or only for its air operations or ground 
services.No nationalization plansThe Italian government had made it clear, though, that it would give preference to 
a complete takeover bid.Rome had ruled out nationalization after keeping the troubled carrier afloat with over 600 
million euros ($708 million), the Financial Times reported. It added that the government might decide to keep a 
stake in the airline, "depending on the outcome of the sale process."Low-cost European carrier Ryanair had been 
one of several companies that had expressed an interest and already made a non-binding offer for Alitalia's assets, 
the Irish airline's financial head, Neil Sorahan, confirmed in August."We're the largest carrier in Italy, so we're very 
serious about anything to do with Italy," Sorahan said in a statement.Alitalia has not turned a profit since 2002. It 
had been on the brink of collapse three times within the past 10 years. Privatized back in 2008, it has since lost 
more than 2.5 billion euros.hg/jd (dpa, AFP, FT)

Aug 07, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Delta Air 
Lines, Inc. DAL[1] have been struggling ever since it reported lower-than-expected second-quarter revenues and 
earnings per share[2] last month. In fact, the stock has declined 7.9% in the last one month compared with its 
industry[3]'s fall of 4.9%. Amid this gloomy backdrop, this Atlanta, GA-based company received good news when it 
reported encouraging traffic data for the month of July.Consolidated traffic - measured in revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs) - came in at 21.73 billion, up 2.7% year over year. 
The upside was driven by a 4.8% increase in domestic RPMs.In fact, consolidated capacity (or available seat 
miles/ASMs) expanded 1.5% to 24.65 billion on a year-over-year basis. However, the metric declined 1% on the 
international front mainly due to a 6.9% reduction in the metric in the Pacific area.Consolidated load factor, or 
percentage of seats filled by passengers, improved 100 basis points to 88.1%. This is because traffic growth 
outweighed capacity expansion in July leading to packed planes. Additionally, the airline recorded an 83.1% on-
time performance and 99.9% completion factor (mainline) for the same month.At the end of the first seven months 
of 2017, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 127.6 billion (up 1.6% year over year) and ASMs of 148.75 billion 
(up 0.2% year over year). Notably, load factor was 85.6%versus 84.4% recorded in the same period last year.Apart 
from the traffic report, Delta was also in the news recently when it announced its decision to invest â‚¬375 million in 
Air France-KLM SA AFLYY[4], thereby strengthening its ties with the latter.In fact, Delta has been constantly 
looking to expand its operations. To this end, the carrier recently announced its intention to launch non-stop flights 
connecting Atlantaand Shanghai. The new service will be operational from July next year.Zacks Rank ...y

Aug 02, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  German airline group 
Lufthansa reports growing profits in the second quarter, as increased passenger demand and lower fuel costs push 
its business higher into record territory.Lufthansa's net profit between April and June stood at 740 million euros 
($875 million), up more than 69 percent from its 2016 second quarter, the company announced Wednesday. 
Operating, or underlying profit reached 1.0 billion euros on the back of 9.3 billion euros in total revenue.Read more: 
Airlines must not charge cancellation feesThe group, which also owns airlines like Austrian, Swiss and low-cost 
Germanwings alongside its namesake brand, said cost-cutting in its passenger business had led to "sustainably 
higher earnings" over the first half of the year.Looking ahead to the full year, Lufthansa confirmed its forecast, which 
it only increased in mid-July, of operating profits adjusted for special items higher than the 1.75 billion euros 
reported in 2016.Fighting off rivalsMeanwhile, Lufthansa's cargo unit returned to profitability in the first half of the 
year as it continues to push through its own efficiency plan, while the airline's maintenance and catering divisions 
continued their growth.In a statement, the executive board promised "continuous structural improvements" to keep 
Lufthansa competitive in a world of challenges from low-cost rivals like Ryanair.The Irish carrier upset Lufthansa's 
plans earlier this year by offering flights from the German carrier's home base in Frankfurt and plans to expand the 
schedule in the autumn.Read more: Air Berlin scans horizon for a saviorIn May, Lufthansa's CEO Carsten Spohr 
also confirmed that his company had held talks to buy part of Germany's second largest airline, Air Berlin. 
Though the rival has already rented aircraft to Lufthansa in a bid to raise cash, so far no sale has taken place.Air 
Berlin has booked losses for the past two years; only once booking an annual net profit since 2008. Whether 
Lufthansa could make a success of the struggling airline is anyone's guess.tr/uhe (Reuters, AFP)

Self-preservation? But no worries, the UK police has vowed to capture anyone on social media [1]who writes

UK Muslim who tried to smuggle bomb onto flight was let go: cops didn't realize it was a working explosiveAugust 1, 
2017, By Robert Spencer : [2] Of course. To have suspected that it was a working bomb would have been 
'Islamophobic.' Meanwhile, 'Mr Sandiford said the prosecution could not be sure if terrorism was the motive.' Of 
course. How could a Muslim carrying a live bomb onto an airliner possibly have anything to do with terrorism? Only 
a greasy Islamophobe could possibly have such suspicions.

working pipe bomb onto Ryanair flight from Manchester to Bergamo but was let go because police didn't realise it 
was a working explosive,'' by Samantha Mordi, Mailonline[3], July 31, 2017 (thanks to Blazing Cat Fur[4]): A man 
who attempted to smuggle a pipe bomb onto a plane was allowed to fly again days later because police did not 
realise the device was viable, a court has heard. Nadeem Muhammad, 43, was attempting to board a flight to 
Bergamo, Italy, on January 30 when security officers at Manchester Airport found the device, made from batteries, 
tape, a marker pen and pins. Jonathan Sandiford, prosecuting, told the trial at Manchester Crown Court Muhammad 
had intended to detonate the device once on board the Ryanair flight. But the court heard when airport security 
swabbed the bomb there was no trace of explosive on the outside and officers did not believe it was a viable 
device. Muhammad, who was born in Pakistan but had an Italian passport, was questioned by police but not 
arrested and on February 5 boarded another flight to Italy. Mr Sandiford said: 'At that stage nobody had realised 
this was a real device and the defendant was allowed to go on his way.' He said it was only on February 8 when the 
device was examined again that suspicions were raised and the bomb squad was called. The explosive was then 
sent for examination by expert Lorna Philp, who found it was a 'crude but potentially viable improvised explosive 
device'. Muhammad was arrested when he returned to the UK on February 12. Mr Sandiford said the explosive, 
which experts said would have been 'unreliable' and 'unpredictable', was made up of batteries, the barrel of a 
marker pen, pins, and double base smokeless propellant normally found in firearms ammunition. If wires, protruding 
from either end of the tube, had been connected to each other the device would have detonated. Mr Sandiford said 
the prosecution could not be sure if terrorism was the motive. He said: 'That may be the most likely motive but 
equally it could be a desire to commit suicide or another purpose altogether.' [ 1]:

Google+ Share on LinkedInAir France is making a dynamic move to consolidate its position in the transatlantic 
flights market by announcing a partial takeover of Virgin Atlantic, the BBC reports. On Thursday, Air France-KLM 
announced it is buying a 31% share of the British Virgin Atlantic, thereby entering a strategic partnership with Delta 
and gaining a stronger foothold in the transatlantic aviation market. 
Richard Branson's Virgin Group will retain a minority 20% share, while Delta holds on to its 49% share. The venture 
will offer lower fares, flights to more destinations, and frequent flyer benefits. Virgin has been facing challenges from 
lower cost competitors for some time, while the sharp devaluation of the pound has weakened its domestic market. 
The new venture will also engage the ailing Alitalia carrier, which currently has 18 companies bidding[1] for its 
takeover including British Airways, Lufthansa, EasyJet, and Ryanair. Alitalia used to make over 50% of its turnover 
from transatlantic flights but has recently been unable to hold its slot at the strategic JFK Airport in New York. At the 
same time, Air France-KLM announced plans for a deeper strategic partnership with China Eastern and Delta, each 
of whom will buy out a10% stake in the Franco-Dutch company. According to Reuters, that will infuse France-KLM 
with fresh capital to the tune of â‚¬751 million. Last week, Air France-KLM announced it will launch a low-cost 
subsidiary named Boost in autumn 2017. The new carrier will have 28 planes, that is, 10 long-haul and 18 short-
haul aircraft. The target group will be both younger and business customers, in a bid to compete with Gulf carriers.

The customer WAS always right

Jul 27, 2017( Businesslife.co: http://www.businesslife.co Delivered by Newstex)  With social media regularly 
exposing company failings, it seems that many firms have their own interests at heart rather than their 
customers'Earlier this year, David Dao, a 69-year-old doctor and father of five, was sitting aboard United Airlines 
Flight 3411 at Chicago's O'Hare airport, about to enjoy a routine trip back to Kentucky to treat patients the following 
day. Then three airport police officers arrived and asked him to get off the plane. And when he refused they 
dragged him from his seat, carried him down the aisle like a corpse and ejected him from the craft. Why?
 Because the flight was overbooked and United Airlines needed space on board for the crew from a partner 
airline. It was an everyday problem that could have been so easily sorted in civilised calm back in departures. But 
soon, the same phones that had eagerly captured the unfolding incident were filming Dao returning to the plane, 
glasses broken and face bloodied, pacing around bewildered and repeating the mantra: 'I have to go home' And 
suddenly the world had graphic evidence of a very distorted view of customer relations.United's CEO Oscar 
Munoz's immediate response was to write off Dao as 'belligerent'. It seems United may have paid too much heed to 
the words, and the bellicose tone, of Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary. He once responded to the notion that the 
customer is always right by saying: 'You know what - they're not. Sometimes they're wrong and they need to be told 
so.'Indeed, while the United incident was a rare case of a corporation violently informing a customer of its decisions, 
others are at it in more subtle ways.Take British Airways, which received a raft of complaints when its IT systems 
failed over the May Bank Holiday, grounding passengers at airports around the world, including Heathrow and 
Gatwick. It left customers up in arms about the lack of assistance they received as they camped out on the airport 
floor. BA's Chief Executive, Alex Cruz, maintained a conspicuously low profile. All of which prompted The Guardian 
to point out that the customer was meant to be king, and to suggest such treatment was now the 'new normal'. So, 
is the idea of the customer always being right now an anachronism? The slogan was popularised by the likes of 
Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of the eponymous London retailer, way back in the early 20th century. It certainly 
was a different time back then - Selfridges boasted reading and writing rooms, and even a Silence Room, where 
punters could 'retire from the whirl of bargains and the build up of energy'. If a customer wished to contact the shop, 
all they had to do was dial its phone number - 1. These days, customers are likely to be dealing with sprawling 
corporations, having to endure interminable instructions from an automated phone voice if they wish to query their 
gas bill, and paying upwards of Â£100 for a four-hour train journey, yet still finding themselves standing.And if they 
have a complaint? The increasingly well-remunerated bosses will be on another planet - and it's more time lost in 
the limbo of an automated phone queue. Changing timesOf course, it may simply be the case that it's harder to 
maintain close customer ties in an era where companies are getting bigger, margins are being slashed, and 
The customer WAS always right
everything happens at a speed that would have sent Mr Selfridge not only to the Silence Room, but barricading 
himself in. 'I'd say it's harder to get customer relations right these days,' says Charlotte Dunsterville, Customer 
Experience Director at Sure Communications in Jersey. 'Let's face it, it's not an easy thing to do in times of cost-
cutting and efficiencies. And now there's massive customer expectation that just grows and grows - companies 
can't afford to stand still.'The cost of inertia could in fact be very high. Bank of England Chief Economist Andy 
Haldane recently suggested that UK corporations risk 'eating themselves' because they're too focused on the short-
term goal of pleasing their shareholders, rather than truly sharing the benefits of their business with their 
customers. Meanwhile, Edelman's annual Trust Barometer (this year headlined Trust in Crisis) shows that globally, 
only around half of people trust business to do the right thing. In the UK, that figure is down to 45 per cent. You only 
need look around to see the connection between declining trust in our systems - which people don't feel are on their 
side - and the disconcerting rise of populism, where vast power shifts towards those who can exploit these feelings 
and offer a sticking plaster, no matter how simplistic or divisive. 'I'd say that there's no excuse for poor corporate 
behaviour,' says Adam Riddell, a Director at Crystal PR in Jersey. 'Trust is at an all-time low, and you see the likes 
of Google or Starbucks making almost voluntary large-scale public tax payments as demonstrations of good 
societal behaviour. That would never have happened five years ago. These are obvious examples of companies 
realising that they need to be doing more to appease their customers and the wider public.'Riddell makes a 
compelling point. These businesses are canny enough to realise that these days, customers do still wield a great 
deal of power - maybe more than ever. And one of the great enablers of this is social media. The only reason most 
of us were able to see the horror of the United Airlines violence is that people could film it and share it on their 
phones so quickly. And you only need to look at United's eventual climbdown - after three days Munoz finally 
related his 'shame' at the incident - to see the power of the viral corporate disaster, especially in an age when some 
customers run to social media at the drop of a hat.People power'Customers have the power,' says Dunsterville. 'It's 
a case of 'I'll tell all my friends and everyone will find out'. As an organisation, it's harder to get it right - and you're 
under more pressure to do so. With social media, there's so much visibility around how brands interact. Businesses 
have to be aware that everything these days is in the spotlight.'That's not to say businesses are in a no-win 
situation. Everyone makes mistakes; the key is how you respond. Companies that can harness the power of social 
media may find themselves flourishing. 'Customers will be spreading their opinions on companies via social media 
and letting everyone decide for themselves, and it's these opinions people now trust more than CEOs, politicians or 
journalists,' says Riddell. 'That is a challenge for businesses, which now have whole avenues they need to be 
monitoring. 'But at least it's a two-way communication,' he adds. 'So companies need to view that as an opportunity 
to engage and build trust, rather than being cautious or treating it as too great a challenge.' There are other steps 
companies can take to ensure their needs stay aligned with those of their customers - listening to them and 
empathising. Dunsterville, whose company has run Channel Islands customer service awards for the past few 
years, believes the key is to put yourself in the customer's shoes. 'If United Airlines had just one person actually 
saying: 'Imagine this happening to me', it would have been dealt with in a far more sympathetic way,' she says. 'But 
no one stopped to think that they're not delivering what the customer booked and paid for.'Dunsterville says Sure 
operates a simple values system that guides all internal decision-making, and that bleeds out into how its team 
responds to, and instils trust in, its customers. It's about asking whether an action is the right thing to do, whether 
it's simple, and whether it shows the company acting as one team. 'What's more efficient for a company often turns 
out to be what's better for the customer too,' she says.This advice sounds simple, and companies would do well to 
remember it. For United Airlines, it may be too late. Having settled out of court with Dr Dao, United staff have since 
managed to upset its customers in several spectacular ways - killing a giant rabbit that was on course to be the 
largest in the world by locking it in the plane's freezer; trying to wrestle a violin from a classical musician because 
she asked if she could carry it in the cabin; and reporting a passenger to the authorities for having his hand too 
close to his five-year-old son's genitals (later issuing an apology that the passenger insisted 'wasn't an apology').In 
each case, not only was the customer clearly not considered right, but their needs were barely acknowledged at all.

results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Jun 30, 2017).On the non-earnings front, the ban on carrying 
laptops in U.S. bound planes from the Middle East has reportedly[4] been lifted. Moreover, three U.S. carriers â€” 
American Airlines Group AAL[5], Frontier Airlines and Delta Air Lines DAL[6] â€” have been heavily fined by the U.S.

2017[8]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. JetBlue Airways' second-quarter 2017 earnings 
(excluding special items) of 64 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. 
Moreover, quarterly earnings improved 20.75% from the year-ago figure. Results were aided by higher revenues. 
Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) increased 5.9, while operating 
revenue per available seat mile (RASM) climbed 7% (read more: JetBlue Airways Tops Q2 Earnings ...venue 
Estimates[9]).2. Hawaiian Holdings' second-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 per share beat the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $1.53. Quarterly revenues of $675 million, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $677 million. Both earnings and revenues increased on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenue per 
available seat mile in the quarter climbed 9.2% year over year. The metric is projected to grow 4.5-7.5% in the third 
quarter of 2017. Capacity is projected to grow 0.5%-2.5%. CASM, excluding fuel, is also projected to rise 
significantly for the ongoing quarter primarily due to the higher labor costs. Fuel cost per gallon (economic) is 
projected in the band of $1.5-$1.6 for the third quarter. The metric is expected in the band of $1.53 to $1.63 for full-
year 2017.3. Ryanair Holdings reported financial and operating numbers with profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 
up 55% year over year at â‚¬397 million on a rise in average airfares. Results got a boost from the timing of Easter. 
The top line expanded 13% to â‚¬1,910 million on the back of a 12% rise in traffic to 35 million. Lower costs aided the 
bottom line. Moreover, load factor increased 200 basis points to 96%.The customer friendly 'Always Getting Better 
(AGB)' program aided results. Average fares are expected to decline approximately 5% and 8% in the first and 
second halves of fiscal 2018, respectively. Net profit for fiscal 2018 is still expected in the band of â‚¬1.4-â‚¬1.45

Middle Eastern nations and Turkey.5. Three U.S.-based carriers have been reportedly[11] fined a total of $850,000 
for violating rules on consumer protection. The DOT fined Frontier Airlines $400,000 for flouting rules pertaining to 
oversales and disability. American Airlines was penalized to the tune of $250,000 as it failed to make timely refunds 
to passengers. Atlanta, GA-based Delta was fined $200,000 by the agency for revealing inaccurate baggage-
related reports.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the

Jul 25, 2017( New Europe: http://neurope.eu Delivered by Newstex)  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on 
Google+ Share on LinkedInRyanair made a 'non-binding offer' for the Italian national carrier Alitalia on Monday. 
Ryanair has expressed an interest in Alitalia many times, provided it is allowed to restructure the company. 
In an interview with Ansa in June, Michael O'Leary said that Ryanair is not necessarily interested in buying airport 
slots, regarded as one of the company's major assets. Ryanair wants mostly Alitalia's short-haul business, 
consolidating its dominant position in a market where it already carried 36 million passengers in 2016, compared to 
22,6 million for Alitalia. Alitalia went to administration in May and was granted a bankruptcy protection in the United 
States until June 26, which has now expired. Alitalia's lease of Terminal 1 at New York's JFK airport expired on 13 
June. US flights generate about 30% of Alitalia's overall revenue, of which half is through flights to New York. The 
pressure on the company is mounting and the prospect of liquidation draws nearer, with a deadline to receive non-
binding offers expiring last Friday. 18 companies have declared their interest, including British Airways, Lufthansa, 
and Ryanair's direct competitor EasyJet. For the Italian national carrier, there are 20,000 jobs at stake. To the 
contrary, Ryanair announced on Monday a 55% quarterly profits surge (â‚¬397 million) boosted by early Easter. The 
company projects to carry 131 million customers in 2017, projecting annual profits of â‚¬1.45bn, The Irish Times 
report. On Monday, Ryanair's share took a 3,7% dive upon hearing the takeover proposal, despite record high 
quarterly profits. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn

Jul 19, 2017( Guido Fawkes' Blog: http://www.order-order.com Delivered by Newstex)  The House of Commons 
was today a green-benched departure lounge; Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn were two very different 
holidaymakers. Wan-faced frequent filer Theresa, slumped closest to the gate, was barely distinguishable from a 
battered old vending machine in a London Gatwick corner. Equally mechanical, but less full of sweetness, for 
Theresa it was just a 45 minute wait for her flight-outta-here; if she could have had speedy boarding she would 
have paid for it gladly. 
In strolls sombrero-toting ethical-traveller Jeremy Corbyn, with glee only shared by priapic teenage boys awaiting 
their first flight to Ibiza. He knows his hols will be spent 'campaigning' on beaches, surrounded by socialist vixens in 
hammer and sickle bikinis (basically). Over magazine-tops in air-conditioned lounges we will all observe our fellow 
travellers this summer. Hopefully we won't end up on the same plane as these two In an unhelpful metaphor for the 
government, the first question was about driver-less cars. 'This country is a world leader in driver-less cars and 
that's part of our strong economy': Theresa May might as well have been reading out a lifeless feature from an in-
flight magazine. She sounded as robotic as middle-aged cabin crew member reciting a list of overpriced 
refreshments over an aeroplane's PA system: it's all played back from memory and delivered with the excitement 
and promise of a moist Ryanair sandwich. Like an unmanned aerial vehicle all she does is drone. Corbyn once 
again demonstrated his navigational ineptitude by taking off in the direction of public sector pay and only eventually 
getting round to Cabinet in-fighting. Would you let that man fly your plane? Would you let him sit in the special seat 
by the emergency exit? It's not likely to trouble you this summer, but if you do find yourself on the same plane as 
Jez, remember that he is probably only there to assist in a hijacking. Alert the sky marshal should you see him 
aboardThe Speaker again played the role of that fluorescent-jacketed EasyJet dispatcher who buzzes around the 
gate, operating at a level of self-importance way above their station. He's the little one behind check-in with the 
overtly welcoming but actually entirely snide personality, familiar from reality documentaries like Airport, blocking 
upgrades and patronising all the passengers. Thank God for a holiday from him. Ian Murray, the vacuous Labour 
MP for Edinburgh South, called Theresa May an 'interim Prime Minister': like a drunk Scot on a package holiday 
flight one longed for him to be off-loaded and refused travel. And like all angry Scots he came in a pack: the SNP's 
Hannah Bardel sat on the back row by the toilets and the galley in her Scotland football shirt. The House of 
Commons now needs to be split into economy and business class sections so that these riff-raff are kept at bay. 
And First Class for Rees-Mogg Theresa's best line came as she blasted Corbyn for 'talking Britain down'. It had 
more than the usual sting in the context of the vacation atmosphere: you can't talk Britain down on holiday. Jeremy 
said the Prime Minister needed to 'take a check with reality': an unusual but effective construction, by which he 
Inside the House of Commons Departure Lounge
meant the Prime Minister needed a reality check. The sense of joy when the final call was made for departure was 
extraordinary: in the history of human recreation, has there ever been a more-welcome holiday than this coming 
break from Prime Minister's Questions? Have a good summer The post Inside the House of Commons Departure

Jul 19, 2017( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Consumers are no longer to 
be charged extra for paying by debit or credit card, the government has said.From January next year, businesses 
will not be allowed to add any surcharges for card payments, reports the BBC[1]. The worst offenders currently are 
airlines and food delivery apps, and small businesses which typically add a fee for cards. In 2010 alone consumers 
spent Â£473m on such charges, according to estimates by the Treasury. 
It follows a directive from the European Union, which bans surcharges on Visa and Mastercard payments. However 
the government has gone further than the directive, by also banning charges on American Express and Paypal too. 
Campaigners welcomed the move, saying it was great news for consumers.Take-awaysAt the moment those 
booking airline tickets with credit cards pay an extra 3 per cent with Flybe, with a minimum payment of Â£5. 
Customers of Ryanair and Norwegian pay 2 per cent. However Flybe has already promised to get rid of the 
minimum payment, and cut its charges. Several airlines, including Monarch and British Airways, have reduced their 
charges in the last year. Take-away food apps are also amongst the highest-charging businesses, the Treasury 
said. Both Hungry House and Just Eat add 50p to the bill for paying by card, although in some cases the charge 
may be paid by the restaurant. On a Â£10 bill, that amounts to 5 per cent. Many local authorities also levy charges of 
around 2.5 per cent. The DVLA will also have to change its card payment policy.Price increasesThe change in the 
law is likely to mean some companies will simply put up their prices, to cover the extra costs they bear with card 
payments. Banks typically charge large retailers between 10p and 20p for each debit card transaction, or 0.6 per 
cent for credit cards. 'Maybe they will bump the price up,' said James Daley, the managing director of Fairer 
Finance, which has been campaigning for the change. 'That's fair game. You have to take customers' money 
somehow. And it's not reasonable to add that cost on at the end of the process. Why not put it in the headline 
price?' There is also a question as to how the ban will be policed. Under the Consumer Rights Regulations[2], 
businesses are only allowed to charge a sum that reflects their own costs in processing a transaction. But Mr Daley 
said many businesses are in breach of the regulations. Some small shops charge a fee for the use of a card - but 
they

after the UK leaves the EU. EasyJet's current base of operations is Luton, outside London. 
That is a consequence of Brexit. As the UK leaves the Single Market, it is also giving up on the 1997 'Open Skies' 
agreement, which allows any EU airline to connect any two destinations anywhere in Europe. This has turned 
EasyJet and Ryanair into consolidated aviation behemoths. As the UK leaves the Single Market, it is also giving up 
on the 1997 'Open Skies' agreement, which allows any EU airline to connect any two destinations anywhere in 
Europe. This has turned EasyJet and Ryanair into consolidated aviation behemoths, taking up market share from 
traditional full-service national carriers. EasyJet Europe wants to retain its licence and air operator's certificate 
(AOC) in an EU member state, which may not be possible when the UK leaves the bloc in March 2019. Vienna 
emerges as a major beneficiary of Brexit, attracting investment due to location, airport infrastructure, and 
competitive tax and labour costs. The Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern hailed the decision as a victory for Austria 
won 'in competition with 27 other EU countries.' Easyject connects 30 countries, mostly in the EU. On Friday, the 
company announced that it plans to re-register 110 planes in Austria, at an estimated cost of â‚¬12 million. The 
majority shareholder and founder of EasyJet is Stelios HajiIoannou, a Cypriot citizen. Last Thursday, Ryanair 
announced that the Irish carrier will also be moving planes from UK airports to the EU. Ryanair's chief executive, 
Michael O'Leary, told the European Parliament's Transport and Tourism Committee that the deadline for airlines is 
September-October 2018. If there is no agreement between the EU and Brussels by then, Airlines will then start 
canceling flights between the UK and the EU. The first flights canceled will be in the spring of 2019, disrupting the 
summer 2019 tourist season, O'Leary specified. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on

http://www.planebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/home-typewriter-copy-1.jpgHello everyone! While I still 
haven't decided what to do with our PlaneBuzz blog, this week's issue of PlaneBusiness Banter [1]is just too ripe 
with goodies not to talk about. 
So if you are a subscriber, that is a good thing, if you are not, you need to be. This week we take our in-depth look 
at the recent earnings reported by United Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Alaska Air Group.  Or 
as I like to say, three of the big four, and the best managed, most financially stable airline in the U.S. Yes, that 
would be Alaska Airlines.  How much debt do you think Alaska is carrying on its balance sheet? Just take a guess. 
No, you're way off. A grand total of $750 million. The airline is not only a great airline for passengers, it's not only 
one of the best in terms of operational performance, but it is a financial treasure â€” certainly worthy of investment 
grade status by the rating agencies. The problem the airline has? What is it going to do with its cash? Nice problem 
to have. As for the other three â€” they all made a lot of money in 2Q15. We will attempt to sort out the differences 
we see with what each airline reported. We also run down the recent results from Lufthansa, IAG, parent of British 
Airways, and Ryanair.  Yes, everybody made money. That's what happens when the price of oil is between $40 and 
$50 a barrel. Oh, and yes, we have PlaneBusiness Earnings Summaries posted for all the remaining U.S. and 
Canadian airlines that have reported earnings as of today. What also happens is that PRASM levels fall. And for 
whatever reason, airline investors (and some analysts) seem fixated on this â€” as though it is akin to the end of the 
world. It's not. I wrote a column in PlaneBusiness Banter last week that took a longer look at this. We use the recent 
earnings results to follow-up this week. I spent six days in Orlando last week between the Global Business Travel 
Association and the Women In Travel http://www.womenintravel.org/Summit, where I was honored to present 
onstage along with Delta Air Lines' SVP of New York, Gail Grimmett, and Amex's Global Business Travel's 
Christine Ourmieres.  GBTA. What can I say? For those of you who are a member, and who attended the 
conference, you know what I mean. It is a grueling mix of business, parties, light lunches, more parties, and more 
business. I was fortunate to be asked to present on a panel there as well. I'll be talking more about GBTA, the 
conference, and the organization's political problems, in our next issue of PBB.  Oh, and what the hell happened to 
shares of Republic Holdings last week? We talk about that situation in-depth this week as well. That is not a good 
situation. All this, and much, much, more in this week's issue of PlaneBusiness Banter! [ 1]:

Jul 04, 2017( Slugger O'Toole: http://www.sluggerotoole.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  I'm not normally stuck for 
words but the current/ongoing/constant/never ending political impasse that is the Assembly has got me. There 
never was going to be a deal. 
The Secretary of State doesn't appear inclined to impose any sort of deadline. The PM isn't likely to jet over here on 
either Ryanair or the next available RAF flight to sort it out. What's going on? Does anyone know? Does anyone 
care? In the real world our healthcare system remains at breaking point. Schools are facing cuts, which will impact 
on pretty much everyone - this is the future workforce we're talking about. Climate change and environmental 
damage is still happening. Women can't be trusted and everyday sexism continues. Public sector workers - many of 
the true heroes of our society - don't merit a decent pay rise. And if you want marriage equality.well. Feel free to 
add your own frustrations to this list. The constant 'they said', 'we want', finger pointing, 'it's not our fault' is not being 
listened to. Instead, people who 'they' represent (pick whatever side you like) are getting on with life, doing the best 
they can with what they have. The thing is, that while yes, the two main parties have their mandate from their 
electorate, they must also seek to represent the entire population. DUP received 225,413 first preference votes, 
with Sinn FÃ©in garnering 224,245. That leaves 353,657 first preference votes for other parties and around 441,650 
who didn't vote. That is over 795,300 people who deserve something better than the current stalemate. So which 
party is going to truly represent everyone and make the first move back into the Executive? And if all else fails, 
there will always be another election. Imagine what progress there could be if nearly 800k votes were cast for 
parties that will get on with the job.Relatedhttps://sluggerotoole.com/2017/06/27/help-keep-slugger-lit-for-another-

enchanted_fairy/shutterstock FINDING WESTEROS IN THE REAL WORLD The new season of "Game of Thrones" 
is coming (just like winter), and if you're a fan, you're probably looking for ways to get your Westeros fix before the 
premiere on July 16. Thankfully there are plenty of exciting "Game of Thrones" related experiences that you can 
check out in real life to get you ready for the show and to enjoy while you watch. From incredible tours of the actual 
filming locations and sword-fighting classes to food and drinks inspired by the series, here are 15 "Game of 
Thrones" experiences for die-hard fans.  Photo credit: Dario Vuksanovic/shutterstock TOUR 'GAME OF THRONES' 
FILMING LOCATIONS From the castles of Winterfell and King's Landing to the Water Gardens of Dorne and frosty 
terrain beyond The Wall, you can visit the stunning locations used to film the series. These guided tours offer an 
intimate behind-the-scenes look of sites in Iceland[1], Ireland[2], Spain[3], Croatia[4], and elsewhere. 
And while the trips might be a splurge, they often offer discounts for groups and added perks like banquets[5]. Plus, 
you can use the trip as an opportunity to explore the surrounding areas with cheap flights throughout Europe on 
WOW Air[6] and Ryanair[7].  Photo credit: betto rodrigues/shutterstock LIVE THE WESTEROS LIFE AT A 
RENAISSANCE FAIR Don your finest Jon Snow or Daenerys Targaryen costume and head to a renaissance fair 
where you can eat, drink, and be merry Westeros-style. Keep an eye out for The Mountain at jousting battles and 
sword fights, shop for artisanal crafts at the market, wave to the king and queen (or don't!), and enjoy the 
performances of medieval musicians, dancers, and jesters. You can also practice your ax-throwing and archery, or 
just enjoy a turkey leg and a goblet of ale.  Photo credit: Courtesy of wikimedia.org SEE A 'GAME OF THRONES' 
CONCERT If you get excited just hearing the pounding drums and swelling strings of the opening title music to 
"Game of Thrones," just imagine how thrilling it is to hear them live in a huge arena. The Game Of Thrones Live 
Experience[8] features live performances led by composer Ramin Djawadi, who writes the music for the series, with 
a full choir and orchestra. Enjoy music from pivotal scenes, characters and houses like the Starks and Lannisters, 
while the stage transforms to recreate locations such as the weirwood tree or the Iron Islands. Scenes from the 
show are also played on giant screens, and there's lots of fire and even the Iron Throne. This year's tour has ended, 
but there's a good chance they'll be on the road again soon.  Photo credit: Fanfo/shutterstock EAT A FEAST 
WORTHY OF KING'S LANDING The blog Inn at the Crossroads[9] features delicious food and drink recipes 
inspired by the HBO show, the original books by George R.R. Martin, and historical accounts of the Middle Ages. 
From breakfast at Winterfell to Cersei's Creamy Chestnut Soup, the recipes are divided up by meal category and 
the regions of Westeros.  Photo credit: Dragon Images/shutterstock LEARN TO SWORD FIGHT LIKE JON SNOW, 
ARYA STARK OR BRIENNE OF TARTH "Game of Thrones" is full of plenty of intense sword fights, and now you 
can learn to wield Valyrian steel like the best of them. Follow in the footsteps of Arya Stark and the sword fighters of

the Free City of Braavos by learning the Water Dance technique from Miltos Yerolemou, who plays Syrio Forel in 
the show. Yerolemou frequently offers the classes at fan conventions around the world, so keep an eye on his 
Facebook page[10] to sign up for the next one. Or learn long-sword techniques based on historical medieval styles 
at home with friends, thanks to online lessons[11].  Photo credit: gameoftoast/facebook.com EAT AT A 'GAME OF 
THRONES' SANDWICH SHOP -- IN ABU DHABI At the cleverly named Game of Toast[12] restaurant in Abu 
Dhabi, you can chow down on sandwiches while surrounded by memorabilia from the show. From the "House of 
Rolls" menu, you can order hearty bites like the pulled beef brisket, and from the "House of Sides," order up the 
sweet potato fries. On the stone walls, you'll find maps of Westeros, swords and shields, and even the Iron Throne 
made from forks and knives.  Photo credit: camlannvillage/facebook.com IMMERSE YOURSELF IN MEDIEVAL 
LIFE At the Camlann Medieval Village[13] in Carnation, Washington, you can learn what it was like to live in 14th-
century England, which was not unlike many parts of Westeros. Explore the recreated medieval village, talk with 
actors well-versed in the period, and watch demonstrations of archery, blacksmithing, textile production, animal 
care, and artwork. You can also enjoy a historically accurate meal at the Bors Hede Inne, shop for crafts, or 
celebrate during one the feasts and festivals held throughout the year.  Photo credit: Georgi Djadjarov/shutterstock 
TOUR HISTORIC CASTLES LIKE THOSE IN 'GAME OF THRONES' Get an up-close look at historic medieval 
castles in Europe[14], many of which inspired the designs of "Game of Thrones." Tour the turrets, cross the moats, 
and learn what life was like centuries ago with guided tours. You can usually save money on the tours if you opt for 
group trips instead of private ones, but if you're looking to really splurge, you can get the full experience by staying 
in an Irish castle[15] for a week.  Photo credit: Rebecca B./yelp.com DRINK LIKE A LANNISTER At the Blood ...ne 
pop-up bar[16] in Edinburgh, Scotland, you can raise a toast like Tyrion Lannister and stay warm during the Long 
Night. The bar features drinks inspired by the Seven Kingdoms, including the Red Wedding merlot and The 
Mountain vodka, as well as delicious Frey pie, and the walls are decorated with maps and memorabilia. The pop-up 
returns just in time for the new season. Meanwhile, a GoT-inspired pub[17] has popped up in Washington, D.C., this 
summer as well, featuring elaborately themed designs and cocktails like the Dothraquiri and The North 
Remembers.  Photo credit: Kishivan/shutterstock MAKE YOUR OWN 'GAME OF THRONES' BEER (OR JUST 
BUY SOME) There's plenty of drinking that takes place on-screen in "Game of Thrones" -- Tyrion, we're looking at 
you -- so if you want to raise a glass with your favorite characters, consider making your own medieval ale at 
home[18]. Or if you'd rather leave the beer-making to the experts, pick up some of the excellent "Game of Thrones" 
inspired beers from Brewery Ommegang[19].  Photo credit: Bildagentur Zoonar GmbH/shutterstock VISIT 
DIREWOLVES AND RAVENS AT AN ANIMAL SANCTUARY Animals play significant roles in "Game of Thrones," 
from the direwolves of the Starks to the dragons of Daenerys. So if you're looking to get an up-close look at some 
similarly impressive animals, consider visiting a wildlife sanctuary in your area, like the incredible Wildlife 
Waystation[20] in Southern California where you'll find rescued bears, wolves, exotic birds, and even lions.

Columbian Airline Unveils Flight Without Seats

Jul 01, 2017( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  This sounds incredibly 
uncomfortable. Courtesy of ZeroHedge[1]. View original post here[2]. Amid knock-down, drag-out fights, scorpions, 
snakes, and ever-decreasing service standards, one airline just turned the amplifier of cost-cutting escapades up to 
'11'  The Independent reports[3] that budget airline VivaColombia is considering plans to remove all seats from its 
planes and make passengers stand. They hope the move will drive down fares by allowing them to squeeze more 
passengers into each flight, opening up air travel to working class Colombians and budget holidaymakers.  
http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2017/07/01/20170701_viva.jpg  
VivaColombia's founder and CEO William Shaw told the Miami Herald the airline was looking into vertical travel 
options. He said:  'There are people out there right now researching whether you can fly standing up - we're very 
interested in anything that makes travel less expensive.'  He added: 'Who cares if you don't have an inflight 
entertainment system for a one-hour flight? Who cares that there aren't marble floors or that you don't get free 
peanuts?'  The concept is not new and airlines have been toying with the idea of standing sections on flights for 
years. In 2003 Airbus came up with an idea of allowing passengers to be braced in a vertical 'seat'.  Ryanair also 
proposed standing areas on its fleet in 2010. At the time boss Michael O'Leary described the standing seats as 'bar 
stools with seatbelts' and expressed doubts that seatbelts were even necessary.  'A plane is 'just a bâ€”-- bus with 
wings', he said, 'If there ever was a crash on an aircraft, God forbid, a seatbelt won't save you. You don't need a 
seatbelt on the London Underground. You don't need a seatbelt on trains which are travelling at 120mph.'  Civil 
Aviation Authorities disagree however, and vertical seats have not been approved by regulators in any country so 
far.  Civil Aviation Director Alfredo Bocanegra told RCN radio that he does not approve.  'People have to travel like 
human beings,' he said. 'Anyone who had ridden on public mass transport knows that it's not the best when you're 
standing.'  We are sure this will all end well, and besides, there's always external 'seating' for the really poor. [ 1]:

Here's Why You Should Add Ryanair (RYAAY) to Your Portfolio
Here's Why You Should Add Ryanair (RYAAY) to Your Portfolio

Jun 30, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Irish low-cost carrier 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has been one of the star performers in the airline space this year. Shares of the 
company have gained 28.2% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks categorized Transportation-Airline 
[2]industry's addition of 13.9%. Catalysts Behind the SurgeWe are impressed by the carrier's decision to expedite 
the growth of its fleet by including more Boeing jets. The carrier's May traffic report was also highly encouraging. 
Traffic increased 11%, while load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved to 95% from 94% a year ago. 
Moving ahead, the company is expected to report strong traffic numbers in the near future as well.Moreover, a 6% 
increase in net profit for fiscal 2017 (ended Mar 31, 2017) despite a challenging air fare scenario is impressive. The 
top line expanded 2% to â‚¬6,648 million on the back of a 13% rise in traffic to 120 million, while lower costs aided the 
bottom line. Load factor also increased 100 basis points to 94% in fiscal 2017.The customer friendly 'Always 
Getting Better" (AGB) program aided results. Net profit for fiscal 2018 is projected to be in the band of â‚¬1.4-â‚¬1.45 
billion, up approximately 8%. The carrier expects ancillary sales to account for 30% of the top line by Mar 2020.A 
Broker FavoriteEarnings estimates for Ryanair have exhibited a healthy uptrend. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of earnings for the current quarter has moved up 24 cents to $1.48 per share. In fact, earnings 
per share for the current quarter are projected to grow 34.55% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for fiscal 2018 has also jumped 27 cents in the last month to $7.34 per share. In fact, earnings per share 
for the current year are projected to grow 27.8% on a year-over-year basis, which compares favorably to the 
industry reading.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to 
be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because the direction of estimate 
revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Other Positive 
MetricsRyanair'strailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Not only has the company's 
ROE of 33.2% remained more or less steady over the last year, it compares favorably with ROE of 29.8% for the 
Zacks categorized Transportation-Airline industry. This reflects the fact that the company is efficient in using 
shareholders' funds.Currently, the ratio of Ryanair's long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) is 88.8. 
Even though on the higher side, the reading compares favorably with the industry's 108.8.Taking into account the 
above-mentioned tailwinds and the favorable readings, we believe that the current price represents an attractive 
entry point for investors. The carrier's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) also supports our view, indicating that the stock 
is likely to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[3]. Furthermore, the company's Momentum Style Score[4] of 'B' highlights its 
short-term attractiveness. The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and 
Here's Why You Should Add Ryanair (RYAAY) to Your Portfolio
make the most of its momentum. Back-tested results show that stocks with Style Scores of 'A' or 'B,' when 
combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform others.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested 
in the airline space may also consider Air France-KLM SA AFLYY[5], Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[6] and American 
Airlines AAL[7]. While Air France and Lufthansa sport a Zacks Rank #1, American Airlines holds a Zacks Rank #2. 
Shares of Air France, Deutsche Lufthansa and American Airlines have rallied over 66%, 28% and 17%, 
respectively, in the last three months.5 Trades Could Profit "Big-League" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above 
spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's 
changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals,

on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Ryanair has reiterated its interest in buying Alitalia if it is allowed to restructure the 
company. Ryanair has been seeking to take over the ailing national carrier since 2013. In May, the Italian 
government gave Alitalia six months to either find a strategic buyer or the company will be liquidated[1]. In an 
interview with Ansa on Tuesday, Michael O'Leary said that Ryanair is not necessarily interested in buying airport 
slots, regarded as one of the company's major assets. 
Ryanair's deal focuses on taking over Alitalia's short-haul business, consolidating its dominant position in the Italian 
market. In 2016 Ryanair carried 36 million passengers, compared to 22,6 million for Alitalia. Meanwhile, Alitalia is 
shedding some of its most valuable assets. Alitalia was granted a bankruptcy protection in the United States until 
June 26, which has now expired. That could mean that Alitalia will not longer be able to fly to New York. The 
carrier's lease of Terminal 1 at New York's JFK airport expired on 13 June. US flights generate about 30% 
of Alitalia's overall revenue, of which half is through flights to New York. The carrier's lease of Terminal 1 at New 
York's JFK airport expired on 13 June. US flights generate about 30% of Alitalia's overall revenue, of which half

Jun 27, 2017( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  By fining Google 
Â£2.1bn for giving special prominence to Google Shopping in shopping-related searches[1], European regulators 
have made exactly the same mistake that they and US regulators did when they fined Microsoft for bundling its 
Internet Explorer with Windows in the 1990s. The basic error is to assume that Google or Microsoft's dominant 
position in the market is unchallengeable - that they are akin to 'natural monopolies' like, say, water or electricity 
companies, and can use their position to exploit consumers - and that instead of competition between platforms 
being able to take place, they must brute-force competition within those platforms. But Microsoft's market 
dominance was much more vulnerable than it seemed, and normal pressures of competition and innovation were 
what did for Windows in the end, no regulators needed. Windows is now only the operating system for 14% of 
devices shipped, and Android is the most-used operating system for browsing the internet[2].An analogy is mobile 
phones: if you assume people are locked into using some kind of Android phone, then the preeminence that Google 
gives to its own products looks like a big problem. 
But when you realise that there are alternatives to Android, like iPhones, competition within the platform begins to 
look less important than competition across platforms.  And forcing within-platform competition might make the 
product worse - look at how vertically integrated iPhones are, which allows things like frequent software updates 
(something Android badly lacks), and how Google products (like the Pixel) have been moving towards that sort of 
model too. It also deprives the company of a revenue stream that makes investment in the free product, like search 
or Android, possible. Finally, bundling or integrating price comparison tools might be good for users who are less 
tech-savvy and would normally go for a 'trusted' but more expensive retailer. If you don't realise that SkyScanner 
exists and would normally just go with BA every time, it could be very useful to get Google Flights right up top, 
showing that Ryanair does what you're looking for much more cheaply. So it's not even clear that prioritising Google 
Shopping results is bad for consumers - it may lead them to be more price-conscious and to shop around between 
merchants more. Even if it is - because it's worse than some alternative price comparison site, for example - there 
is still no case for punishing Google for giving it special prominence. If Google Shopping is worse for consumers 
then it must be acting as a revenue raiser for Google, and a de facto way of charging for use of Google search (and 
other free Google products).  If people can switch between platforms it doesn't matter that much if, within a 
platform, there isn't that much competition. Prioritising a particular shopping search engine is not akin to gouging 
water users with higher prices because there are alternatives to Google that users can switch to easily. If the overall 
user experience is made worse by Google Shopping being prioritised, then users will have the option of moving to a 
search engine like Bing which is perhaps less good as at search but better overall because it does not prioritise a 
The EU 's got it all wrong on Google
bad shopping tool. Indeed Bing has specifically targeted Google Shopping, which they say is worse than their own 
tool, to get users to switch. And there is an incentive created for entrepreneurs and large existing rivals of Google 
like Facebook to create their own, rival platform. Along with this broad point there are some specifics about this 
case that make it even weaker. It doesn't take account of how people do online shopping: as well as search 
engines they also use things like Amazon and eBay, and they get advice about things from social sites like 
Facebook and Instagram. And bundling clearly doesn't work that well for Google if the product isn't that good - 
Google Flights gets special prominence if you search for flight information, and rivals like SkyScanner and Kayak 
are doing fine.But the core issue here is whether we need to force competition within software platforms if 
competition exists between them. Just as Windows users moved to other operating systems (both on mobile with 
Android and iOS and desktop with Linux and Apple's OS X), Google users have plenty of alternatives they can 
switch to if they think that Google's bundling worsens the platform's quality enough. Bundling has benefits as well 
as costs, because it pays for the free things Google does and allows for more streamlined use of software. Trying to 
stamp 
it 
out 
will 
end 
up 
hurting 
users 
in 
a 
misguided 
quest 
to 
help 
them.

Klarna is a great illustration of the financial marketplace
Klarna is a great illustration of the financial marketplace
The Finanser by Chris Skinner

Jun 26, 2017( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: http://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Swedish business 
bosses are known for being careful with their words, even some might say dull. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is 
different. It might be his tech background or his age, he is 35, but the chief executive of Klarna is not afraid to speak 
his mind. 
Announcing this week that his company had become the biggest fintech in Europe to receive a banking licence[1], 
he said he wanted Klarna to become the 'Ryanair[2]' of the sector and attack the high-voltage incumbents. 'Ryanair 
has pretty bad customer service,' sniffed one senior Swedish banker. But in the next breath, she added: 'That's to 
take nothing away from Klarna. What Sebastian has achieved there is remarkable.' Mr Siemiatkowski and two 
university friends took a deceptively simple idea on invoicing and applied it to the digital age. The result is an online 
payments system that is simpler for customers and better for merchants, with fewer dropped transactions caused 
by people balking at filling in too much information. Instead, customers pay for online goods after they receive them, 
and Klarna takes the credit risk from the sellers in return for a cut. Entered 12 years ago in an entrepreneur 
competition at Sweden's leading business school, the idea was rejected[3] by many of the country's leading 
executives. The desire to prove that elite wrong still clearly motivates Mr Siemiatkowski. 'For me personally, it's a 
day I've been looking forward to for a long time,' he said of Monday's decision by Swedish regulators to give Klarna 
a banking licence. Mr Siemiatkowski has also long stood out in Sweden as one of the few business people willing to 
give his opinions about politics. Many others are unwilling to rock the boat in the consensus-driven country. 
Speaking after the most recent national elections that saw a breakthrough for the anti-immigration Sweden 
Democrats, Mr Siemiatkowski told the Financial Times: 'We believe that Sweden becomes a much better place 
because people from all over the world are working here. Seeing the Sweden Democrats growing feels like taking 
the country back 100 years ago.' That impatience with the traditional ways of doing things has led to Klarna 
becoming one of the most highly valued technology groups in Europe. A round of fundraising in 2015 valued it at 
$2.25bn. And it is solidly profitable, making an operating profit of SKr138m ($16m) in the first quarter on revenues 
of SKr992m. Klarna's ambitions go way beyond increasing profits. Mr Siemiatkowski talks about how the financial 
industry is unusual for being a sector still dominated by national players, offering a broad range of services. His 
vision instead is of a group of global players offering specialised services. So Klarna will use its banking licence to 
offer bank cards and salary accounts to its 60m users. But it will not offer mortgages, savings products or share 
dealing. Instead, Mr Siemiatkowski expects other fintechs to do that, with the possibility of several of them teaming 
up loosely to provide the full offering. Its large userbase, mostly in Germany and the Nordics, means Mr 
Siemiatkowski thinks he can get around one big problem for fintechs of being largely unknown to the general public, 
Klarna is a great illustration of the financial marketplace
who hesitate to trust them. 'We are still moving at the speed of a fintech, but provide the trust and security of a 
bank. That makes us a super rare animal.' The big goal for Klarna, however, may only be tangentially connected to 
the banking licence. It is trying to crack the US and UK markets. Some wonder whether Mr Siemiatkowski has bitten 
off more than he can chew by becoming a bank. 'Online payments is one thing. But being a bank you end up being 
heavily regulated. I wonder if they can cope with that,' says another top Swedish banker. Mr Siemiatkowski is not 
worried. He says: 'Companies are cool, but banks are cooler. Building a bank is even cooler.' [ 1]:

Jun 17, 2017( Right Wing News: http://rightwingnews.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  It's not unusual for a couple to 
try to join the Mile High Club while on a flight but usually, they try to do that in the airplane bathroom, where there is 
at least a small amount of privacy. But passengers on board a Ryanair flight got quite a show when one couple 
started going at it mid-flight. After the video went viral, however, the truth about the couple came out[1], shocking 
everyone.

31-year-old 
Shaun 
Edmondson was flying from Manchester to Ibiza when he met a woman. They didn't know each other for long, but 
they evidently hit it off, as they began having sex in full view of other passengers. Edmondson even went so far as 
to ask other passengers if anyone had a condom before going at it. 'I heard them talking about it but I thought they 
were joking,' Kieran Williams, who filmed the tryst, said. 'The guy was shouting, 'Anyone got a jelly?'. We all 
laughed but then ten minutes later they actually did it. They seemed so drunk, they brought a lot of attention to 
themselves. You could see the girl taking off her pants and he pulled his trousers off. She started riding him. I had 
to get my phone out. I have never seen anything like that.' Ã—           https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-

everyone was amused â€” a female passenger sitting next to Edmonson complained and asked to be moved, but 
the flight crew did nothing. A Ryanair spokesman has since responded to the video, which has gone viral. 'We are 
looking into this matter,' the spokesman said. 'We will not tolerate unruly, disruptive or inappropriate behavior at any 
time and any passengers who appear to behave in an unacceptable manner may be liable for further sanctions.'To 
make matters even worse, though, is that not long after the video went viral, it came to light that Edmonson was

Jun 16, 2017( CapitalCube: http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/ Delivered by Newstex)  Our analysis is based on 
comparing Deutsche Lufthansa AG with the following peers - Delta Air Lines, Inc., United Continental Holdings, Inc., 
Ryanair Holdings Plc Sponsored ADR, Copa Holdings, S.A. Class A, China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited 
Sponsored ADR Class H, LATAM Airlines Group SA Sponsored ADR and Air France-KLM SA Sponsored ADR 
(DAL-US, UAL-US, RYAAY-US, CPA-US, CEA-US, LTM-US and AFLYY-US). Deutsche Lufthansa AG's dividend 
yield is 1.91 percent and its dividend payout is 9.39 percent. This compares to a peer median dividend yield of 1.38 
percent and a payout level of 13.80 percent. This relatively higher dividend yield and lower payout ratio makes the 
company a good candidate for dividend investors looking seeking good current dividend income within this peer 
group. 
In addition, the company's relatively good dividend quality score of 67 out of a possible score of 100, underscores 
its attractiveness for dividend investors. Dividend Quality Overview Dividend quality trend has not been consistent 
over the last five years. Dividends were paid during 4 of these years â€” of these 1 was high quality, 1 was medium 
quality and 2 were low quality. The ending cash balance, with a dividend coverage of 23.92x, provides a substantial 
cushion in case of a significant reduction of cash flows in the future.Quadrant label definitions. Hover to know 
moreHigh Score;High Yield, High Score;Low Yield, Low Score;Low Yield, Low Score;High Yield Dividend 
CoverageOver the last twelve months (prior to March 31, 2017), DLAKY-US[1] paid a medium quality dividend. The 
source of the company's cash to support the dividend paid over the last twelve months is operating cash flow 
(coverage of 16.14x), investing cash flow (coverage of -16.87x), issuance cash flow (coverage of 3.50x) and twelve-
month prior cash (coverage of 16.31x), for a total dividend coverage of 24.92x.These coverage ratio factors imply 
that the firm's net cash inflow from issuance was required (in addition to operating and investment cash) to pay the 
dividend, which suggests a medium dividend quality. Dividend HistoryA complete list of metrics and analysis is 
available on the company page.Company ProfileDeutsche Lufthansa AG provides passenger, freight and cargo 
airline services. It operates through the following segments: Passenger Airline Group; Logistics; Maintenance,

The Vultures Are Circling Alitalia as It Looks for a Savior
The Vultures Are Circling Alitalia as It Looks for a Savior

Jun 08, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  The worst airline ever, Alitalia, 
has had a busy few months. After continuing to bleed money thanks to Etihad's failed turnaround plan for the 
airline, Alitalia went bankrupt and the Italians went looking for someone â€” anyone â€” to step in to save the day, just 
as Etihad had done a few short years ago. Though I expressed an interest in buying the airline[1] for a penny if 
someone else wanted to absorb its debts, I never actually submitted that plan. But now, word is out that there are 
32 parties who have expressed a formal interest[2]. I'm guessing less than half are more legitimate than mine, but 
they're being kept confidential for now. 
I'd bet most of these are a Pan Am-style buffet where airlines want to pick the meat off the bloated carcass and let 
the rest just sink to the bottom of the ocean, but I suppose there could be a couple of folks interested in something 
more.The problem first started back in 1946 when Alitalia was founded. Wait, that's not right. Though honestly I 
can't remember when Alitalia's problems began. After years of turmoil, Alitalia thought it had found a savior in 
Etihad back in 2014. Etihad came in with a turnaround plan that involved going upscale and tweaking the network, 
but it was doomed from the beginning. It became quickly evident that the plan wouldn't work and profit was not right 
around the corner. It all fell off the rails last year as Alitalia's dreams of profit were dashed while others smelled 
blood in the water. Low cost carriers saw tremendous opportunity in Italy and ramped up. Ryanair has been 
particularly active, even choosing Rome as its first connecting hub[3]. Alitalia continued to flail while it prepared for 
a stand-off with labor. A desperate turnaround plan[4] was put out there, but it required the unions to go along. To 
just about nobody's surprise, they shot themselves in the foot and turned it down. Alitalia is operating off a cash 
infusion for the next few months while the search for a sugar daddy goes on. As someone who has loved writing 
about Alitalia since I crowned it the 'worst airline ever' in the early days of the blog back in 2006, I find myself pulling 
for the airline. Why? Well, I just can't imagine a world without my favorite whipping boy in the skies. Oh sure, there 
are other candidates for the position as worst airline ever, but none can hold a candle. I received plenty of notes 
from people asking whether this was the end, and honestly, I doubt it. The Italians have too much pride in their 
national carrier to realize that it's completely and totally unnecessary. If Alitalia were to go away, then other airlines 
â€” profitable ones â€” would swoop in immediately and fill the void. When it was announced that there were 32 
entities interested in saving Alitalia, I know a lot of people were shaking their heads. Why would anyone be 
interested? Well, we aren't sure that anyone truly is interested in Alitalia the airline. We do, however, know that 
airlines are interested in Alitalia's assets to get a jump on the competition if the airline went away. This is the Pan 
Am strategy. United picked off Pan Am's Pacific network in the '80s. Just a few years later, it bought the airline's 
Heathrow rights. Then Delta bought the rest of the European network while promising to prop up the piddly remains 
The Vultures Are Circling Alitalia as It Looks for a Savior
of the airline. That lasted about 5 minutes and Pan Am was gone for good. Do we know that's what's happening 
with Alitalia? Well, we do to some extent. While the bids are confidential, the bidders are welcome to out 
themselves. And some have done just that. Ryanair, for example, is one of the companies showing interest[5] but it 
doesn't want to buy Alitalia. It just wants to pour airplanes into Italy and then feed Alitalia's long haul flights. There's 
no way the Italians will go for that, but they should seriously consider it. Lufthansa is also interested. It has long 
been an important player in northern Italy with its Air Dolomiti operation that connects Italy with its Munich hub. You 
might also remember the short-lived Lufthansa Italia operation that flew from Milan to other European cities. That 
failed, but it shows that Lufthansa is always interested in an Italian opportunity. Of course, Lufthansa doesn't want a 
piece of the airline. It just wants its assets - fleet, slots, etc. Air France, a longtime Alitalia partner that has been 
distancing itself in recent years, is always rumored to be interested, as is Delta. But it's likely they have the same 
interest Lufthansa has. Is there anyone who would actually want Alitalia to remain, thrive, and grow? Well, Etihad is 
tapped out, it would seem. So who do airlines turn to when nobody else is willing to play? Hainan parent HNA 
Group of course. That company has been buying up anything it sees and is quickly replacing Etihad as the leader of 
the movement to support failing airlines. I have to assume HNA is sniffing around. The thing is, I will be shocked if 
the Italians are willing to let Alitalia go. So you might end up with some kind of goofy situation where Alitalia lives on 
in name only just to placate the leaders of the country while nothing else stays the same. The best thing that could 
happen to the airline is for it to go away and let healthier airlines step in. But let's hope that doesn't happen. I just 
can't stand the thought of finding a new worst airline ever. [Original vulture photo[6] via Flickr user Stuart

wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings HA[1] , posted a impressive traffic results for May. Traffic- measured 
in Revenue Passenger Miles or RPMs - climbed 8% to around 1.37 billion in May 2017. Meanwhile, Available Seat 
Miles (ASMs: a measure of capacity) expanded 5% to 1.58 billion.Load factor (the percentage of seats filled by 
passengers) increased 240 basis points (bps) to 86.7% in May 2017 as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. 
The carrier further said it attracted 966,179 passengers on its flights during the month, thereby representing a 5.1% 
year-over-year increase.On a year-to-date basis, Hawaiian Airlines witnessed a 7.5% rise in RPMs to approximately 
6.5 billion. 
Also, ASMs improved 4.1% to 7.61 billion. As a result, the load factor increased 270 bps to 84.8%. Passenger count 
in the first five months of 2017 grew 3.2%.Apart from releasing its traffic report, the carrier raised its second quarter 
projection pertaining to operating revenue per ASM (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) due to better-than-
expected yields mainly in the domestic network among other factors. The company now expects this key metric to 
grow in the band of 7.5% to 10.5% (earlier projection had called for a rise in the range of 5.5% to 8.5%). The bullish 
RASM view pleased investors. As a result, the stock gained in after-market trading on Jun 6.Additionally, fuel cost 
per gallon (economic) is now projected in the band of $1.6-$1.7 (earlier range was tuned at $1.65-$1.75) in the 
second quarter of 2017.Price PerformanceShares of Hawaiian Holdings have performed well so far in the current

last year, it was already generating $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to 
$47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave

Jun 05, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Atlanta, GA-based Delta 
Air Lines DAL[1] posted an increase in air traffic for the month of May 2017. Consolidated traffic - measured in 
revenue passenger miles (RPMs) - came in at 19.14 billion, up 1.7% year over year. The upside was driven by a 
2.9% increase in domestic RPMs.In fact, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) was flat at 22.07 
billion on a year-over-year basis. The metric declined 3.1% on the international front mainly due to a 13% reduction 
in the metric in the Pacific area. 
On the contrary, consolidated load factor, or percentage of seats filled by passengers, improved 140 basis points to 
86.7%. This is because traffic expanded while capacity remained flat in the month leading to packed planes. 
Additionally, the airline recorded an 82.7% on-time performance and 99.9% completion factor (mainline) for the 
same month.At the end of the first five months of 2017, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 84.7 billion (up 1% 
year over year) and ASMs of 100.6 billion (down 0.4% year over year). Notably, load factor was 84.2% versus 83% 
recorded last May.We believe that more than the above numbers, it was Delta's 3.5% increase in passenger 
revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a measure of unit revenue) registered in May that pleased investors. 
Consequently, the stock gained 2.69% to close the trading session on Jun 2 at $51.19.Delta Stock Performing 
ImpressivelyShares of Delta rallied 5.5% and outperforming the Zacks categorized Transportation-Airline[2] 
industry's gain of 3% over the last one month.The strong May traffic report and the impressive PRASM performance 
are further positives for the stock.Zacks Rank ...ocks to ConsiderDelta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-
ranked stocks in the airline space include United Continental Holdings UAL[3], Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[4] and 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5]. While United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Lufthansa and Ryanair sport 
a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. We note 
that shares of Lufthansa, Ryanair and United Continental have gained 55.4%, 30.8% and 12.6%, respectively, on a 
year-to-date basis.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the 
booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is 
expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, 
but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look. See the pot trades we're targeting>>

Jun 05, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate Release 
Chicago, IL - June 05, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the 
Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include United Continental Holdings (NYSE: UAL[1] - Free Report [2] ), 
Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV[3] - Free Report [4] ), Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ: RYAAY[5] - Free Report [6] 
) and Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft (OTCMKTS: DLAKY[7] - Free Report [8] ). Today, Zacks is promoting 
its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free [9] .  Here are highlights from Monday's 
Analyst Blog:  4 Airline Stocks that Outperformed the Industry in May  It is a well-documented fact that the airline 
stocks reported mixed results in the first quarter of 2017. Even though a fair share of sector participants came out 
with better-than-expected earnings per share, bottom-line growth was negligible due to high costs. 
Moreover, with many airline players inking labor deals, it was of no surprise that the surge in labor costs hurt the 
bottom line. Bulk of the reports was out in the month of April. Apart from the mediocre earnings performance, many 
airline stocks led by United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL[10] - Free Report [11] ) encountered serious customer 
related issues. Notably, these factors led to the Zacks categorized Transportation- Airline [12] industry's gain of a 
mere 2.6% in April. Improved Performance in May  Despite disappointing performance in April, airline stocks gained 
significantly in May on the back of several positive factors. Investor-Friendly Measures The month of May also saw 
airline heavyweights like and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV[13] - Free Report [14] ) hiking their respective 
quarterly dividend payouts apart from announcing fresh buyback plans. Delta raised its quarterly dividend to 30.5 
cents per share (annualized $1.22 per share), representing an increase of 50.6% over the previous payout of 20.25 
cents per share (annualized 81 cents per share). Additionally, the Atlanta, GA-based carrier's board of directors 
cleared a new $5 billion share buyback program. The new share repurchase plan is expected to be completed by 
June 2020. Close on the heels of Delta's quarterly dividend hike, the Dallas, TX-based Southwest Airlines 
announced a dividend raise along with a new share repurchase program worth $2 billion. In fact, this low-cost 
carrier raised its cash quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share (50 cents per share annualized), representing an 
increase of 25% over the previous quarterly payout of 10 cents per share (40 cents per share annualized). A4A's 
Bullish View  The bullish view of Airlines for America ('A4A') - the largest airline trade association in the U.S. - 
regarding air travel for the summer season was another positive incident to have taken place in May. The 
organization has predicted that the three-month period (Jun1- Aug 31) will be the busiest for U.S. carriers in terms 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: United Continental Holdings , Southwest Airlines , Ryanair Holdings and 
Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft
of air travel. Strong demand for travel on the back of an improving economy is expected to drive passenger 
volumes to an all-time high. Moreover, the volume (234.1 million) is likely to be 4% higher than the year-ago figure. 
We also note that the air travel projection for the summer season translates into 2.54 million fliers per day, during 
the said period. Apart from an improving economy, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more 
Americans taking vacations (Read More: U.S. Carriers Likely to Have Busiest Summer, Says A4A [15] ). Other 
Tailwinds Late last month, members of OPEC and some non-OPEC producers announced their decision to extend 
the current level of production cut until the first quarter of 2018. The decision disappointed investors leading to a 
drop in oil prices below the $50 a barrel mark. This boosted [16] airline stocks as lower oil prices mean good news 
for airline stocks. Moreover, in the same month it was revealed that Warren Buffett, founder and CEO of Berkshire 
Hathaway, increased his stakes in American Airlines and Southwest Airlines in the first quarter of 2017 by 8% and 
10%, respectively. We believe that as Buffett is one of the most revered investors of all times, his continued efforts 
to root for airline stocks is a major positive for the sector. Stocks that Outshined the Industry In view of the above 
positives it is of little wonder that the Zacks Transportation-Airline industry doubled its gain in May compared with 
the level in April. However, there are certain players in the space who performed even better. We note that with a 
plethora of stocks present in the airline space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to pinpoint potential 
outperformers. This is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company's strong fundamentals, can come in really 
handy. To this end, we have shortlisted four companies that have outperformed the industry in May, and sport a 
Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here 
https://www.zacks.com/stocks/buy-list/?ADID=zp_1link_invideas...D=zpi_1link_invideas . 4 Solid Picks Ryanair 
Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY[17] - Free Report [18] ) is an Irish low-fare airliner that primarily operates from 
Europe. The carrier sports a Zacks Rank #1. The stock has rallied 16.2% in May outperforming the Zacks 
Transportation-Airline industry's gain of 5.3%. Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft (OTCMKTS:DLAKY[19] - 
Free Report [20] ) operates as an aviation company in Germany and internationally. It operates through Passenger 
Airline Group, Logistics, MRO and Catering segments. Deutsche Lufthansa sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has gained 
12.3% in May. United Continental , based in Chicago, is the holding company for both United Airlines and 
Continental Airlines. The company, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, operates an average of nearly 5,000 flights a day to 
multiple destinations. The stock has gained 13.4% in May. Southwest Airlines , a passenger airline that provides 
scheduled air transportation in the US, is our next choice in our list of outperformers. The company carries a Zacks 
Rank #2 and has gained 6.8% in May. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?  Here's another stock 
idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires 
and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already 
reaching 265 miles on a single charge.  With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one 
company stands out as the #1 stock to buy, according to Zacks research.  It's not the one you think.  See This

Be in the News Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the 
general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 "Strong Buys" were generated by the stock-picking system that has 
nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015. Its average gain has been a stellar +26% per year. See these

Jun 05, 2017( CapitalCube: http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/ Delivered by Newstex)  Wizz Air Holdings Plc reports 
financial results for the half-year ended March 31, 2017. We analyze the earnings along side the following peers of 
Wizz Air Holdings Plc - Ryanair Holdings Plc, easyJet plc and Air Berlin PLC (RYA-GB, EZJ-GB and 0GPE-GB) 
that have also reported for this period.Highlights Summary numbers: Revenues of GBP 561.72 million, Net 
Earnings of GBP -6.31 million. Gross margins narrowed from 9.79% to 5.20% compared to the same period last 
year, operating (EBITDA) margins now 4.43% from 6.60%. Year-on-year change in operating cash flow of 51.66% 
is about the same as the change in earnings, likely no significant movement in accruals or reserves. Earnings rose 
compared to same period last year, despite decline in operating and pretax margins.The table below shows the 
preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth: Access our Ratings 
and Scores for Wizz Air Holdings PlcMarket Share Versus ProfitsWIZZ-GB[1]'s change in revenue this period 
compared to the same period last year of 27.09% is almost the same as its change in earnings, and is about 
average among the announced results thus far in its peer group, suggesting that WIZZ-GB[2] is holding onto its 
market share. 
Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by -25.56% and earnings by -103.04% compared to the 
immediate last period. Quadrant label definitions. Hover to know moreLeader, Earnings Focus, Laggard, Revenues 
Focus Earnings Growth AnalysisThe company's year-on-year decline in earnings was influenced by a weakening in 
gross margins from 9.79% to 5.20%, as well as issues with cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA 
margins) went from 6.60% to 4.43% in this time frame. For comparison, gross margins were 31.82% and EBITDA 
margins were 29.91% in the previous period. Quadrant label definitions. Hover to know moreDifferentiated; Low 
Cost, Commodity; Low Cost, Commodity; High Cost, Differentiated; High Cost Gross Margin TrendCompanies 
sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and 
vendors. Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in 
working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the 
company's performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using 
the balance sheet. WIZZ-GB[3]'s decline in gross margins has not produced any significant offsetting improvement 
in its working capital . This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the decline in gross margins are likely from 
operating issues and not trade-offs with the balance sheet. Working capital days are currently 273.29 days, 
compared to last year's level of 216.93 days. Quadrant label definitions. Hover to know moreCustomer Financed,

GB[4]'s change in operating cash flow of 51.66% compared to the same period last year is about the same as its 
change in earnings this period. Additionally, this change in operating cash flow is about average among its peer

Booker: Mrs May's "walk-away"
Booker: Mrs May's "walk-away"
EU Referendum

Jun 04, 2017( EU Referendum: http://www.eureferendum.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Picking up on a theme 
explored by this blog, Booker today argues[1] that the "no deal" embraced by Theresa May could bring Britain to a 
halt. As long as that remains a threat, we may think we know what the result will be this Thursday, but we shan't be 
able to arrive at a proper verdict on this dismally superficial election for a year or two, Booker says. At the start of 
the campaign, he listed four important issues that would not be seriously discussed or even mentioned. The first 
three were our terrifying national debt, our disastrous energy policy and the horrifying mess of our "child protection" 
system. 
But the biggest issue of all, the one that we were told this election is all about, was Brexit. Yet, all we have really 
been told is that Theresa May believes she is the only person qualified to get a successful trade deal in the most 
difficult negotiations of her lifetime. And if she fails, she will simply walk away, on the grounds that "no deal is better 
than a bad deal".Booker, as do I, fears that in the coming months we are in for some very nasty shocks as we 
discover (or confirm) just how dangerously intractable countless issues will prove to be. Among our biggest 
problems will be Mrs May's decision that we should leave the European Economic Area to become what the EU 
classifies as "a third country". At least remaining in that would have made our leaving the EU incomparably easier. 
Even at this stage, there is a general awareness of at least one issue already, helped on its way by an outspoken 
speech from Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair. That issue is aviation, one of the areas in which the 
relentless drive for European integration has enmeshed more closely than most. Now, every conceivable detail of 
how our airlines and airports operate is governed by a vast thicket of EU rules. These cover everything from the 
certification of pilots and aircraft to the allocation of landing slots at airports, from our entire air traffic control system 
to the freedom of aircraft to fly in and out of Britain at all. All this, says Booker, we only enjoy as members of the 
EU. To replace our right to remain within that system once we leave will, legally, be incredibly complicated. At least 
this might be done if discussions begin as soon as possible, although the day after last year's referendum the head 
of the International Air Traffic Association was already warning that there was "likely to be insufficient time to 
complete the necessary processes".But this pales into insignificance compared with what would happen if we walk 
away from the negotiations without a deal. We would suddenly find ourselves without any legal authorisation to 
allow airliners or freight-carrying aircraft to operate anywhere except within the UK itself. Our air traffic with the 
outside world would come overnight to a complete stop. This naturally seems so unthinkable that to raise such a 
possibility at all, as O'Leary has done, is already being described as just "scaremongering", with the corollary that 
the EU couldn't possibly be silly enough to allow it to happen.  But that is the inescapable reality we would face if 
we walk away without a deal. It is not what the EU would have done to us; it would be the inevitable result of what 
we had done to ourselves. And there's the rub. To suggest otherwise, like so much of what is said about Brexit, is 
Booker: Mrs May's "walk-away"
just very dangerous wishful thinking. For sure, there are mitigation measures that could be taken. In the event of a 
"walk away", the UK could negotiate aviation agreements anew with all the other "third countries" and some 
measure of access could be restored. Nevertheless, refusal to deal with the EU means that European airspace 
would remain closed to us. As we have charted relentlessly on this blog, this is by no means the only sector which 
will be affected, which actually makes the a "no deal" scenario into something so unfathomably damaging that one 
cannot believe that anyone could serious contemplate it. Unsurprisingly, according to The Times[2], the "no deal" 
mantra is causing bemusement "from Berlin to Rome" as politicians and industrial leaders from across Europe hope 
Theresa May's insistence that no Brexit deal is better than a bad deal is just election posturing and fear the worst if 
she really means it. "We know the mantra that no deal is better than a bad deal but I think every bad deal will be 
better than no deal for Great Britain", said Detlef Seif, head of Angela Merkel's party group on the EU affairs 
committee of the Bundestag - as retailed by The Times. "I think, and I hope, that these words of Theresa May are 
just for the British electorate and not for the negotiations", he added. This, in itself, may be wishful thinking, as the 
Prime Minister launched her mantra on 17 January 2017 during her Lancaster House speech[3], well before she 
decided on her general election ploy. The Germans don't leave it there, though. Walking away without an 
agreement would be "a dramatic own goal" for Britain warns Matthias Wissmann, president of the German 
automotive association (VDA). He says that the economic consequences would be much worse for the British side 
because there were no facilities in place for border checks on goods and no staff to carry out customs duties, 
meaning supply chains would be badly disrupted. The most common reaction in Berlin to Mrs May's talk of being a 
"bloody difficult woman" in Brexit talks or Jeremy Corbyn's acceptance of Brexit was one of grim resignation but 
enduring puzzlement. Yet being a "bloody difficult woman" is the least of Mrs May's problems. Relying on his work 
which produced the Seven Basic Plots[4], Booker hypothesises that Mrs May is trapped in her own personal 
"fantasy cycle".This has a clear archetypal structure comprising five stages, starting with the anticipation Stage, 
when some dark egocentric urge is looking for a focus. Only in the dark recesses of Mrs May's mind does that 
secret reside but, some time ago, that took her into the dream stage. This second stage takes over when the focus 
has been found. Those possessed by the fantasy get ever more headily carried away by it, and for a while all 
seems to be going wonderfully well. Driven by their dark egocentric urge, they seem to be getting away with it. The 
fantasy has a great deal to do with Mrs May's inadequacies when it comes to Brexit. Without a firm exit plan, she 
has slid effortlessly into the third "frustration" stage, where things have gradually begun to go wrong: first the little 
things, then bigger things, as reality has closed in on her fantasy. From there, the next destination is the nightmare 
stage, where external reality will start closing in on her. Everything starts to go horribly, uncontrollably wrong as 
their bubble of make-believe begins to collapse. That Mrs May is locked into the frustration stage will become 
increasingly more obvious when the Brexit negotiations begin next month. And once she has passed from this and 
through the nightmare stage, she will enter the "death wish stage".At that point, Mrs May's entire fantasy will at last 
reveal what has been its true nature all along as it fatally and irretrievably collides with reality. For her, at least, all 
will be lost. Sadly, it looks as if she is set to take the whole nation down with her. [ 1]: http://URL [ 2]:

Jun 01, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of the Dallas-
based Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[1] have appreciated 3% in the last one month, outperforming the Zacks 
categorized Transportation-Airline[2] industry's gain of 1.4%. Reasons Behind the OutperformanceSouthwest 
Airlines announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase program worth $2 billion at its 
annual meeting of shareholders. The new buyback scheme will replace another $2 billion repurchase plan which 
was completed recently. 
Simultaneously, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.125 per share. The new dividend will be 
paid on Jun 28, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Jun 7.In fact, the company has an impressive history of 
rewarding shareholders. Evidently, the company returned $673 million to shareholders through a combination of 
dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter of 2017.We are also impressed by Southwest Airlines' 
employee-friendly approach. In Feb 2017, the carrier paid $586 million to its employees as part of its profit-sharing 
plan for 2016. This is the 43rd consecutive profit sharing arrangement at Southwest Airlines. In fact, the payment in 
2016 equates to approximately 13.2% of each employee's earnings in the year.The low-cost carrier's guidance with 
respect to operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) also raises 
optimism. The metric is expected to grow in the band of 1% to 2% on a year-over-year basis. The company's April 
traffic report was encouraging as well.Estimates on an UpswingNotably, earnings estimates for Southwest Airlines 
have exhibited a healthy uptrend. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has 
moved up 6 cents to $3.82 per share.Likewise, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter of 2017 has 
climbed 5 cents over the last two months to $1.18 per share. We are also impressed by the carrier's consistent 
efforts to expand its operations.In view of the above positives, we believe that this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company 
represents an attractive investment opportunity at current levels.Other Gems in the Airline SpaceInvestors 
interested in the Airline space may also consider Hawaiian Holdings HA[3], United Continental Holdings UAL[4] and 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks 
#1 Rank stocks here.We note that shares of Ryanair and United Continental have gained 28.2% and 9.3%, 
respectively, on a year-to-date basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hawaiian Holdings has moved up 42 
cents to $5.19 per share over the last sixty days, for 2017.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric 
Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the 
world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas 
guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging 
stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one

hit over the intercom during a flight from Gran Canaria to Seville last week.Video of his passionate performance, in

May 31, 2017( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  You don't have to 
go far - say to the Labour Party Manifesto, or this time around the Tory one in fact - to find people complaining that 
capitalism is some form of a rip off. In their lust for profits the plutocrats grind the faces of the workers into the dust, 
short change the consumers. 
And yet we also face the obvious truth of the world around us. Those people living in a place which has been 
roughly capitalist and roughly free market for any reasonable period of time are as rich as any group of human 
beings ever have been. They have more than those who came before. And thus it must be true that capitalism 
makes things cheaper, something not consistent with everyone being ripped off. And a specific example[1]:  
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, has helped drive down short-haul ticket prices in Europe 
by increasing its capacity by 33% in the past two years. Its cost base, widely acknowledged as the lowest of 
Europe's major carriers thanks to low plane purchase, maintenance and staff costs, has allowed it to undercut rivals 
while still making a profit. The Irish airline made a profit after tax of â‚¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn) in the year to the end of March, 
even though it slashed ticket prices to fill almost 14m seats added during the period. Chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said fares had fallen 13% but profitability had doubled over three years. He added: 'Frankly I see no reason 
why that trend won't continue.' The capitalist plutocrats can and do cash in by reducing the prices to consumers, 
making 
them 
better 
off. 
Which 
is, 
of 
course, 
why 
the 
system 
works 
as 
a 
whole.

May 31, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The past week saw 
U.K.-based carrier British Airways suffering a major IT system failure that resulted in the cancellation of flights and 
untold miseries to passengers. Also, updates (albeit of a mixed nature) on the laptop ban extension on U.S. flights 
grabbed headlines.Delta Air Lines DAL[1] also made news in the past week, that was a day short of trading owing 
to the Memorial Day holiday on May 29, as it aims to ease U.S.-Mexico air travel through its association with 
Aeromexico.On the earnings front, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2] reported modest 
results in fiscal 2017 (ended Mar 31, 2017) and issued a cautious outlook for fiscal 2018.Transportation - Airline

246Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return[3](Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here[4]).Recap of the 
Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Delta strengthened its long-standing partnership with Mexico's largest airline 
Grupo Aeromexico by implementing a joint cooperation agreement (JCA) to operate flights connecting the U.S. and 
Mexico.As part of the JCA, the carriers recently stated their intention to launch five flights targeting new markets. 
Apart from adding new routes, the carriers aim to increase the frequency of flights and use more modern aircrafts in 
four and two markets, respectively. 
The measures aimed at facilitating travel between the nations (likely to be implemented as early as this fall) are 
subject to government clearance. (Read more: Delta Air Lines ...romexico Aim to Ease US-Mexico Travel[5]).2. 
Earlier this week, it was reported[6] that the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had said in an interview 
that passengers may be banned from carrying laptops in all flights to/from the U.S. However, a Politico report[7] on 
May 30 stated that the US had decided against banning laptops from the cabins of US bound planes from Europe 
as of now.3. Ryanair Holdings reported financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 2017 up 6% year 
over year at â‚¬1,316 million despite a 13% decline in average airfares. The top line expanded 2% to â‚¬6,648 million 
on the back of a 13% rise in traffic to 120 million. Lower costs aided the bottom line. Moreover, load factor 
increased 100 basis points to 94%.The customer friendly 'Always Getting Better (AGB)' program aided results. The 
carrier issued a 'cautious' outlook for fiscal 2018 following anticipation of negative Brexit-related developments and 
repetition of terror attacks. Average fares are expected to decline in the band of 5-7% in fiscal 2018. Net profit for 
fiscal 2018 is expected in the band of â‚¬1.4-â‚¬1.45 billion, up approximately 8%.The low-cost carrier expects ancillary 
sales to account for 30% of the top line by Mar 2020. The company is looking to expedite the growth of its fleet by 
including more Boeing jets. Ryanair sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's

carrier in the U.K. (in terms of on fleet size) encountered a major IT system failure, resulting in cancellation of 
multiple flights. The global disruption was apparently caused by 'an exceptional power surge,[9]' which caused the 
IT system to collapse resulting in the catastrophe.Whatever be the reason, the meltdown affected travel plans of 
thousands of passengers with chaos at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. The airline, which is investigating the 
incident, said that it will compensate the concerned passengers. However, costs on that front may exceed the Â£100 
million mark.5. According to a Bloomberg report[10], American Airlines Group AAL[11] intends to curtail the legroom 
for passengers on its newest Boeing 737 planes. By trimming the space between rows more seats/passengers can 
be accommodated, thereby allowing it to sell more low-priced tickets. It is widely believed that the move is aimed at 
countering the threat posed by low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines SAVE[12] and JetBlue Airways Corp. 
JBLU[13].Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 
week and during the last 6 months.                  The table above shows that majority of airline stocks traded in the 
green over the past week resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining almost 1% $113.33 over the period. 
The uptick was primarily driven by the decline in oil prices following the extension of supply curbs by top producers 
led by OPEC.The fall in oil prices naturally boosted airline stocks. Over the course of six months, the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index appreciated 8.23%. Shares of GOL Linhas GOL[14] appreciated the most (57%).What's Next in the 
Airline Space?Focus will remain on May traffic reports from the likes of Delta and Hawaiian Holdings HA[15] in the 
coming days. Investors would also await further updates on the laptop ban.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge 
on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007? Now 2017 
looks to be a pivotal year to get in on another emerging technology expected to rock the market. Demand could 
soar from almost nothing to $42 billion by 2025. Reports suggest it could save 10 million lives per decade which 
could in turn save $200 billion in U.S. healthcare costs.A bonus Zacks Special Report names this breakthrough and

Ryanair Introduces Connections and Prepares for Interlining, But Don't Expect Crazy Cheap Fares
Ryanair Introduces Connections and Prepares for Interlining, But Don't 
Expect Crazy Cheap Fares
The Cranky Flier

May 30, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Connections suck. Oh sure, as 
a traveler you don't like them, but I'm looking at it from the other side. Airlines don't like offering connections 
because they add operational complexity and cost. What the airlines eventually figure out, however, is that there's 
enough commercial benefit to make the effort worthwhile. 
It appears Ryanair has finally gotten to that point with the introduction of connections on a few routes via Rome[1]. 
But Ryanair is doing it differently than how more traditional airlines do it. And to understand how it's different, we're 
going to need to dive into a bit of a history lesson first. The History of Connections, Part IThe big hub-and-spoke 
airlines learned long ago that connections were vital to their businesses. See, they figured out that if they could 
have more flights in a market than other airlines, they could get an outsized share of the lucrative business travel 
spend in that market. But it's hard to just add a ton of flights in a market when there's not enough demand for that 
capacity. Take Dallas/Ft Worth, for example. To really own that market, airlines need to have a lot of frequency in 
small and large markets. Sure, a big market like Dallas to Houston can probably support a bunch of flights on its 
own, but what about Nashville? Or Oklahoma City? It's important to have a lot of flights in every market, but there 
aren't going to be enough people flying solely between Dallas/Ft Worth and those cities to fill those seats. Enter the 
hub. American might not be able to run a bunch of flights from Dallas/Ft Worth to Nashville based solely on local 
demand, but once it could start gathering people from LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Albuquerque, etc then it could fill 
up those airplanes to Nashville with ease. Today, for example, American has 9 flights in that market with 1,336 
seats (soon to be 25,482 seats once American finishes adding density to its fleet). That's a ton of seats, and they're 
largely supported by the connections that are offered. This means American can offer a killer schedule for the 
Metroplex business traveler by filling the extra seats with connections. (The flip side is that American can now get 
people in Albuquerque to an incredible array of destinations with a single stop, so it's good news on both fronts.) 
The only problem for American is that while there isn't much competition in the nonstop market from Dallas/Ft 
Worth to Nashville, there's a ton of competition for people flying from Albuquerque to Nashville with a stop. So fares 
are likely to be lower even though costs are higher. (This has changed recently in smaller markets where no low 
cost competition means connecting fares are higher[2], but I'm not going to get into that today.) The system works 
in one sense, but from a consumer perspective, it seems weird and confusing why something that costs so much 
more to operate would actually have a lower ticket price. After all, the cost differences are somewhat significant 
when connections are introduced. For a nonstop flight, the airline takes someone's bags and puts them on the 
airplane. Then it offloads them on the other end and the traveler picks them up. With connections, airlines need a 
Ryanair Introduces Connections and Prepares for Interlining, But Don't Expect Crazy Cheap Fares
whole infrastructure to transfer bags. This doesn't even get into the issue of missed connections and other 
operational headaches. Flying nonstop is much simpler. The Ultra Low Cost Carrier Connection StrategyIf you think 
about it from an ultra low cost carrier perspective, the idea is simple at the beginning. These airlines can cherry pick 
the routes that have the most traffic and the highest fares. They can avoid all those extra costs of having 
connections while still having plenty of traffic to fill their airplanes. And without those costs, they can offer fares that 
are even lower, helping to siphon traffic away from the established airlines while also stimulating new traffic. Over in 
Europe, Ryanair became a master at this by serving lower cost airports that weren't even in a city. Anyone who has 
been to Hahn Airport, for example, would be hard-pressed to really call that 'Frankfurt.' But the fares were low 
enough that people flocked to Ryanair and took buses into Frankfurt. The same thing occurred at Stansted 
(London), Charleroi (Brussels), Girona (Barcelona), and in a perverse way that only the Italians could manage, 
Ciampino, which is an alternate airport that's actually closer to Rome than the primary airport at Fiumicino. Ryanair 
also had the benefit of not trying to explicitly serve the business traveler. So as it grew, it was able to serve more 
routes that had enough demand for a couple flights a week but not enough for a daily schedule that a business 
traveler would need. This created whole new markets where British people bought vacation homes in France and 
Spain. Just the existence of the cheap flights helped to spur growth in demand over what was previously there. As 
Ryanair grew, it started running out of good growth opportunities. So it started to look for ways it could grow its 
revenues. One option was to start flying into primary airports, even if they were more expensive. Today you'll find 
Ryanair in Brussels, Barcelona, and Rome/Fiumicino among others. Sure it costs more, but the revenue benefit 
outweighs the cost. Yet as the airline continues to grow, it needs new outlets to help sustain itself. And now the time 
for connections â€” to both other Ryanair flights and flights on other airlines â€” has arrived. The Ryanair Twist on 
ConnectionsThe initial test involves just a few routes flowing over Rome[3]. (See, Alitalia, who needs you?) People 
flying from Alicante, Barcelona, Bari, Brussels, Catania, Comiso, Malta, and Palermo can connect to each other via 
Fiumicino. But this isn't Ryanair following the script of hub-and-spoke airlines of years' past. Just look at the pricing.I 
looked at several routes, and they're all roughly pricing in a similar manner. There is no discount for connections. If 
you want to connect from, say, Catania to Barcelona via Rome, you're going to pay the sum of the local fares in 
each market plus a small premium (been around 10 euros on the options I've seen, but it varies) for the privilege of 
pricing them together on one ticket. Ryanair isn't alone here, though it's a bit more subtle than what some others 
have done. Notably, AirAsia actually sells its connecting service as an additional branded product called FLY-
THRU[4]. From a cost perspective, treating connections are a more expensive, premium product makes sense. But 
from a revenue perspective it doesn't if you're thinking with a traditional mindset. Ryanair may be roughly price-
competitive with other airlines on the route (except Vueling which flies it nonstop), but in most cases I've seen, the 
layovers are pretty lengthy. And Ryanair is never about being competitive. It's about having really, really cheap 
fares that undercut everyone. I assume Ryanair is just looking at this differently than a traditional airline would. It's 
not trying to build a business travel schedule. It doesn't need extra volume to fluff out a flight schedule. But if it can 
get a few people at a premium to what it sells in the local markets, then that will help it grow and add flights over 
time. If not, so be it. It's not worth it for Ryanair to offer super cheap connections just to try to goose the size of the 
network. It only wants profitable connections. Right now this is just a test, but when you think about the power of the 
Ryanair network, even one person each day on some of these routes will aggregate enough in Rome to help fill an 
airplane, especially once it rolls out to the whole network and beyond. It's not just Ryanair's own flights that are in 
play here. Ryanair just started selling Air Europa flights from Madrid to South America[5] on its website. This may 
seem odd since it doesn't involve connections or Ryanair flights at all. For example, see this:But that's because this 
is again a test. Later this year, you'll be able to buy connections from Ryanair flights on to these long-haul Air 
Europa flights at Ryanair.com. Other airlines will follow. With such a large network of options, even tiny numbers 
can add up quickly and provide a benefit to the Ryanair network. For Ryanair, this is a different path than others 
have taken. It has already built a massive and successful European network. But if it can get more passengers to fill 
its airplanes, whether from its own connections or from other airlines, then it will be able to keep up the growth rate 
that it needs to keep costs lower. And it can do it profitably. [ 1]: https://corporate.ryanair.com/news/news/170517-

May 30, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  Irish budget carrier 
Ryanair has reported a decent rise in full-year profit despite a business environment that has driven down ticket 
prices rapidly. 
But increased capacity and cost cuts proved successful.Ireland's Ryanair on Tuesday announced a 6-percent rise 
in bottom-line earnings for its business year ended March 2017.Europe's largest carrier by passenger numbers said 
it earned net profit of 1.316 billion euros ($1.46 billion) at the lower end of its own forecast range, but in line with 
analysts' expectations.Ryanair registered 120 million passengers for the whole year, targeting 130 million for the 
current year to March 2018 and thus implying growth of 8 percent.Calmer waters ahead?The carrier said it 
expected fares to fall by another 5 to 7 percent in the current business year, down from an even bigger drop of 13 
percent in the previous year."We are pleased to report an increase in profit after tax," CEO Michael O'Leary said in 
a statement, and that "despite difficult trading conditions caused by a series of security events at European cities, a 
switch of charter capacity from North Africa, Turkey and Egypt to mainland Europe, and a sharp decline in sterling 
following the June 2016 Brexit vote."Ryanair currently has 1,800 daily flights across 33 countries and has used the 
low-fare environment to press home its cost advantage.hg/jd (Reuters, dpa)

May 30, 2017( Market Folly: http://www.marketfolly.com Delivered by Newstex)  We're posting up notes from the 
2017 London Value Investor Conference[1]. Next up is Gary Channon of Phoenix Asset Management who pitched a 
long of Easyjet (LON: EZJ). Gary Channon's Presentation at London Value Investor ConferencePhoenix is a UK 
focused fund that since inception in 1998 has returned 12% annualised vs the 4.9% for the UK benchmark.Long: 
Easyjet (LON: EZJ) There is an intrinsic human desire to travel. GDP per capita and the cost of travel drive the 
overall market. Air travel has been doubling about every 12 years. 
Yet airlines have been terrible businesses except for Southwest Airlines in the US. The Southwest model has been 
copied by both Ryanair's and Easyjet's founders.It is often assumed that Ryanair and Easyjet are competing. 
Ryanair is thought of as the low-cost producer and to be more effective than Easyjet. Channon argued that the two 
airlines have different strategies and are not competing. They do not fly the same routes - there is only 4% overlap. 
This is not an accident but a deliberate strategy. Easyjet takes customers from convenient airport to convenient 
airport. Ryanair is low cost - inconvenient airport to inconvenient airport. Both companies produce a similar return 
on capital.Easyjet has a moat which is underappreciated by the market. The moat is derived from the slots it owns. 
The slot is the right to take off and land at a certain time on a certain day. The slots are regulated by quasi-legal 
international conventions referred to as Grandfather Rights. The slots belong to the airlines not the airports. A slot 
can provide pricing power if it is at a sought-after airport where demand outstrips supply. The lack of runways in the 
UK and Europe and the failure to build new ones guarantees a shortage of supply. Because of the value of slots 
airlines tend to be against the expansion of runways while the owners of airports tend to be supporters.The slots 
provide a barrier to entry as people's propensity to switch airports is limited. Only 20% of passengers are prepared 
to add an extra hour to their travel if they are on a short-haul European flight. Easyjet's real competitors are those 
who fly the same routes from busy airports - mainly British Airways and Air France but certainly not Ryanair. British 
Airways and Air France are not strong competitors to Easyjet because they have structurally higher costs due to 
pension schemes, staffing costs and culture. This creates an environment in which Easyjet will keep expanding, 
gradually taking the flag-carriers business.Channon estimates that three-quarters of Easyjet's business is protected 
by a slot-constrained moat. This provides pricing power and high returns.The opportunity for Phoenix to invest in 
Easyjet came about because of Brexit. Channon said he thought Brexit was a non-event for Easyjet. It does not 
change the competitive landscape and Easyjet will get a European license. Phoenix bought their Easyjet stock 9 
months ago. Channon said he would not buy today but would wait for the price to fall below Â£10 per share (the 
stock is trading at around Â£13.80). Be sure to check out the rest of the presentations from the London Value

flight cancellations around the world, huge queues at terminals at the UK's major airports and many in other 
countries, and a severe hit on reputation and trust that could cost BA dearly. According to BA[4], a computer 
systems failure led to all this. It was caused by a power outage at a data centre near Heathrow airport in London on 
Saturday May 27, they said. 
That event knocked out all the airline's means of managing flights, aircraft movements, passenger bookings, check-
ins, baggage handling, you name it, even their phone systems. The impact was global, affecting operations 
everywhere. The result has been ugly scenes on the TV screens in every broadcaster's news bulletins throughout 
this past weekend and during the Monday Bank Holiday in the UK, showing airport terminals packed with crowds 
looking for answers and solutions that nobody was able to answer or fully deliver. It's been splashed across the 
front pages of newspapers here and worldwide, every day for three days.It's been a constant headliner across the 
social web, notably on social networks Twitter[5] and Facebook's public timeline[6]. There's no end of commentary 
and opinion on the power outage with a large amount of incredulity about the scale of the outage, with IT 
professionals and others weighing in on BA's apparent lack of business continuity planning (system backups, 
etc).@British_Airways[7] Power supply failure? When was the back-up last tested? â€” andrew rostron

Customer ExperiencesIn the midst of all this is the customer service and relationship issue - the many thousands of 
passengers on those cancelled British Airways' flights who were hoping to jet away into the sun for family holidays, 
who instead endured living nightmares in an airport terminal. Compounding those nightmares was what clearly 
seems to be a lack of knowledge by BA staff on the ground on what was happening and what to do in a rapidly-
evolving situation where accurate information effectively communicated as quickly as possible was essential yet 
was nowhere to be seen or heard during the critical first 48 hours of this crisis. The effects of such a situation are 
well summarized in the concluding remarks of the experience recounted in a report[18] yesterday by Economist 
The big asks of British Airways
columnist Buttonwood who eventually did make it to his destination: The whole experience was alarming. The BA 
staff clearly were as poorly informed as the passengers; no one in management had taken control. No one was 
prioritising those passengers who had waited longest. No one was checking that planes were on their way before 
changing flight times. BA has a dominant position, in terms of takeoff slots, at Heathrow, Europe's busiest hub. On 
the basis of this weekend's performance, it does not deserve it. And what of communication by British Airways? A 
banner on the BA website[19] says the airline plans to operate 'a full flight schedule' at Heathrow and Gatwick 
airports in the UK today as normal.During the weekend, I saw various messages on BA's Twitter[20] and 
Facebook[21] accounts, where the social media communicators looked to be valiantly endeavouring to speak 
without saying a great deal of meaningful words, perhaps because they didn't know what more to say that could be 
meaningful. I saw a handful of videos on YouTube[22] with BA's CEO, Alex Cruz[23], apologising for the disruption 
and talking about how hard everyone was working to get things fixed up. That message was largely repeated each 
day. Already there are calls for his resignation; he says he will not resign[24]. It would be so easy to second-guess 
what more or differently BA ought to have done from the comms perspective at a time like this, but we don't know 
all the facts yet. So there's an information vacuum that BA couldn't really fill; as communicators, we all know what 
that means - someone else will step in to fill it on BA's (unrequested) behalf. Cue the mainstream media with its 
powerful resources to investigate and publish (news reports, commentaries and editorial opinions) plus the free-
form, uncontrolled virality of social media and social networks. What a recipe for FUD[25]! And that's not even 
wondering where fake news fits in to all that.The Cost of The FixOn Sunday, the Guardian reported that British 
Airways could face a Â£100 million compensation bill[26] over its IT meltdown (I've seen other reports since 
mentioning a figure of Â£150 million or more). The Guardian quoted someone from the GMB trade union blaming job 
cuts at BA for the IT problems which were thought to relate to the power outage, something the airline denies. In its 
initial assessment, the Financial Times reported[27] on chaotic scenes at Gatwick and Heathrow airports at the 
weekend, with many passengers hitting out at the airline for a lack of information and the scarcity of senior 
management on the ground. 'It really is a big deal,' says Andrew Charlton, an aviation analyst. 'The cost of its hub 
going down is enormous and the ripple effect down the entire operations will take about 14 days to work out of the 
system. Aircraft are in the wrong place, crew are in the wrong place, connections are lost, there is a need to find 
ways to re-accommodate passengers. It will go on and on.' The FT made reference to a similar problem that befell 
US airline Delta last year who said that the knock-on effects of its crisis would cut its pre-tax income by $150 
million. Could British Airways be facing such huge financial consequences? I imagine much will depend on the 
following: How quickly BA can fully bring back online all its IT systems, or a backup system. How quickly can it 
assume normal operations that provide passengers with the confident assurance that they'll get where they want to 
fly to, with their baggage. How openly, honestly and transparently BA communicates with all its stakeholders about 
what happened, what they've done to ensure the same won't happen again, and how they will seek to re-acquire 
the trust and support of each of its stakeholder groups that include investors, employees, passengers, partners, 
suppliers and regulators. Just three items, but each one is a big ask. Numbers 1 and 2 are likely to be resolved 
quickly (although some reports suggest it may take weeks for baggage problems to be fully resolved). Add to 
number 3 above three further questions[28] from the distinctly technical perspective. Has it been an actual crisis for 
the airline? One popular definition of a crisis is an event or situation that negatively impacts a publicly-listed 
company's share price. We'll see what that looks like for BA's parent IAG[29] when the stock exchanges open this 
morning. Yet I believe such a definition is too narrow today where events such as described here have a 
measurably negative effect on how the organization is perceived by its customers - indeed, by all its stakeholders - 
in areas of reputation and trust over the long term. As for Mr Cruz, he's the CEO and carries the ultimate 
responsibility within IAG[30] for British Airways' financial health and reputation. The time to talk about stay or go will 
likely be influenced by how big that final compensation bill is versus the answers to the three points above. First

BA Debacle Puts Spotlight on Airlines' Old IT Systems, Cuts
BA Debacle Puts Spotlight on Airlines' Old IT Systems, Cuts

May 30, 2017( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  The catastrophic IT failure at 
British Airways that ruined travel plans for 75,000 people has raised questions about some older airlines' focus on 
costs to the detriment of investment in new computer systems. As British Airways resumed full service Tuesday, 
shares in its parent company, International Airlines Group, dropped 3 percent as investors appeared to worry that 
the company's quality of service may have been undermined by recent efforts to save money. Disaster struck on 
Saturday, when the company's computer systems went down and there was no functioning back-up. The airline 
cancelled all flights and only managed to resume full service on Tuesday. "Although cost cutting has been good for 
the share price in the last year, it will come back to bite IAG if it stops them from doing what they are supposed to 
do: Fly passengers to their destinations," said Kathleen Brooks, the research director at City Index. IAG has been 
battling tough competition, even as it has faced pressure on its earnings from a weaker pound following Britain's 
decision to leave the European Union. 
The company issued a profit warning following the Brexit vote nearly a year ago. Cost pressures aggravated an 
already complicated situation. Renewing IT systems is complex, time-consuming and expensive   a factor that 
prompts many companies to put it off as long as possible, said Loizos Heracleous, a professor of strategy at 
Warwick Business School. The problem with IT systems is recurring across the industry, particularly among 
established airlines. In August, Delta Air lines cancelled hundreds of flights when a power outage likewise knocked 
out its computer systems worldwide. Airlines face challenges with their IT systems also due to linkages across their 
systems. There's further demand on the system when companies consolidate   as has been the case among 
airlines   since "IT issues get heightened and any vulnerabilities are exposed." Such troubles give an advantage to 
newer airlines such as Ryanair, a cost-cutting BA rival that focuses on short haul budget flights. "The ability to set 
up an airline from scratch by-passes a lot of the legacy issues, because you can go for state-of-the-art systems," 
Heracleous said. "Newer airlines can also invest in IT systems that are more easily upgradeable and scaleable. An 
airline such as Ryanair, that is also financially successful, has more leeway to divert needed resources towards 
upgrading its IT systems." Capitalizing on BA's troubles, Ryanair said it had seen "strong bookings" over the 
weekend. Its Twitter account rubbed salt into the wound with tweets that poked fun and added the hashtag 
``ShouldHaveFlownRyanair.'' The company's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, admitted on the BBC "we had 
a bit of fun on social media." "We don't take social media seriously but we do take IT very seriously and that is why 
we've never had an outage," he told the BBC. Ryanair posted a 6 percent increase in annual profits Tuesday to 1.3 
billion euros ($1.4 billion) despite "difficult trading conditions," caused by terror attacks in European cities and a 
sharp decline in the British pound. BA, meanwhile, is counting up the cost of an IT debacle that some have 
BA Debacle Puts Spotlight on Airlines' Old IT Systems, Cuts
estimated could run into the tens of millions. There are also all those news clips of passengers swearing they will 
never fly the airline again. "The whole sorry episode has undeniably put a dent in BA's reputation for delivering a 
premium service," said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

May 29, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Atlanta, GA-based 
Delta Air Lines DAL[1] is making constant endeavours to widen its international presence. In line with this strategy, 
the carrier is looking to strengthen its presence in the lucrative Mexican market.Notably, Mexico is currently inviting 
huge traffic, courtesy the depreciation of the Mexican peso. Given this favorable backdrop, Delta and Mexico's 
largest airline Grupo Aeromexico strengthened their long-standing partnership by implementing a joint cooperation 
agreement (JCA) to operate flights connecting the U.S. and Mexico.As part of the JCA, the carriers stated recently 
that they intend to launch five flights targeting new markets (Atlanta - Merida, Atlanta - Queretaro, Los Angeles - 
Leon, Seattle - Mexico City, Portland, OR - Mexico City). Apart from adding new routes, they aim to increase the 
frequency of flights and use more modern aircrafts in four and two markets, respectively. 
The measures aimed at facilitating travel between the nations, might be implemented as soon as this fall, subject to 
government clearance.Among other benefits, the partnership will result in a 10% increase in trans-border seat 
capacity by Dec 31, 2017. Moreover, the alliance is likely to attract huge traffic, thereby boosting the carriers' top 
line. Also, the collaboration should find favor with passengers as it offers them greater choice. The carriers aim to 
improve the travel experience of passengers by making suitable infrastructural investments.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

May 23, 2017( Money Under 30: http://www.moneyunder30.com Delivered by Newstex)  I was first introduced to the 
wonderful world of European budget airlines when I moved to Prague to teach English[1]. It was so cheap and easy 
to fly from one city to another that my biggest problem was figuring out where to go first. In the ten years since, the 
American airline scene has also seen the expansion of budget offerings, with some European brands now flying in 
and out of American airports. If you're planning to fly to Europe this year, it may be cheaper than you think. Here's 
everything you need to know about European budget airlines.A brief history of European budget airlinesThe 
European Union's 1992 decision to create a single-market airline system[2] (which the U.S. followed in 1994) meant 
that airlines could freely fly both cargo and passengers across EU member countries without being required to 
register as a carrier in every country. 
This momentous decision created a surge of discount flights and carriers that take passengers to a wide variety of 
EU and overseas destinations. The leading European budget airlines according to flight traffic and passengers 
carried (as opposed to the experience of flying them) are:RyanAir[3] (65 million annual passengers; leading carrier 
of international travelers among European airlines, with the largest number of European destinations[4] of all 
airlines, surpassing even British Airways) easyJet[5] (30 million annual passengers) Air Berlin[6] (part of the 
OneWorld alliance; third-highest passenger traffic)As The Telegraph[7] recently reported, Europe's budget airlines 
have thrived to the extent that there are thoughts of connecting a regional carrier (such as RyanAir) with one that 
has a broader number of non-EU international flights, like Norwegian Air, for example. Increased choice would 
eliminate one of the main points of competition between budget[8] and major airlines. Such a merger could also 
improve amenities and services, convenience of airport locations, and public perception of low safety. So pay 
attention to budget airlines over the next few years. They could continue to disrupt and dominate airline travel.How 
much do you actually save on discount flights?Flyers of RyanAir may remember the infamous (and falsely 
advertised) '0.01 â‚¬ flights' which, after taxes, luggage fees, and so forth were never actually that price. RyanAir has 
thankfully stopped this sort of 'teaser' advertising. However, there are ways to save a pretty decent amount of 
money and cut your costs by 10-30 percent. To maximize your chance of a getting an optimal fare, book early and 
follow the same guidelines you'd use to save money on a traditional airline ticket[9].Be there when others aren't: 
Most people don't want to drive to the airport at 11:45 PM and stand in line to go anywhere. This depresses fares. 
Flying mid-week can also help. Fly the off-season. An extension of this philosophy is: 'if the weather is the lousiest it 
will be at your destination all year, the flights will probably be cheaper.' Don't fly during generally recognized 
holidays. Note that other countries tend to have more holidays than work-obsessed America, so look up local 
European Budget Airlines: Everything You Need To Know To Save On Your Next Trip To Europe
holidays before you inadvertently book a flight on one. Don't book your ticket less than two weeks in advance. 
Purchase a round trip ticket. Examples of European versus American budget fares (round-trip) New York to Berlin, 
spring (May 15, Monday, to May 21, Sunday), during the day: AirBerlin, $842.85[10]; American Airlines, $953 (least-
expensive flight)[11] New York to Warsaw, summer, (June 20, Tuesday to June 30, Thursday), during the day: 
Norwegian Air, $1146.20[12]; American Airlines, $1282.00 (least-expensive flight)[13] San Francisco to London, 
spring, red eye (flies into Gatwick Airport; May 16, Tuesday to May 25, Thursday): WOW Air, $420.00[14]; 
American Airlines, $674.00[15]For these three itineraries, WOW Air (based in Iceland) saves more money than do 
the other two. However, while it appeared that WOW Air provided the greatest cost savings versus our 'control' 
airline (American), often the amount of savings varied depending on the information entered in terms of times, flight 
dates, and so forth. Furthermore, WOW Air has fewer flights than either AirBerlin or Norwegian Air, which may have 
a negative impact on a traveler's ability to use the carrier. It can be said that American Airlines, in my various 
comparisons, sometimes had roughly equivalent prices, but not one that was lower.Which U.S. airports host 
European budget airlines?Included here are the groups of European budget airlines that fly either to or from airports 
in major U.S. cities (this is a partial list):Budget Airline DrawbacksOne of the biggest challenges in using low-cost 
airlines is that they generally don't allow the booking of connections with initial ticket purchases (one exception is 
AirBerlin). This even applies to connecting flights when you stay on the same discount airline. Many of the airlines 
predominantly fly out of airports that are quite distant from their actual destinations. RyanAir is known for this: Paris 
Beauvais Airport is about a two-hour bus ride from Paris, Stanstead Airport (London) is 30 miles outside of London 
and near the Hertfordshire border, and so forth. Discount airlines also won't have the same types of amenities as 
the major carriers. If you're not familiar with the discount airline experience, you should be quite careful with respect 
to the following:Luggage: You should weigh each luggage item and measure its dimensions before you leave, then 
check with the airline's website for its specific guidance. Many discount airlines have smaller maximum sizes for 
carry-on luggage, and lower maximum weights for checked luggage. Worse, some of the discount airlines have per 
kg (note: 1 kg is equivalent to 2.2 lb) charges that can add up and (if you've miscalculated) quickly drive up the cost 
of the flight. Fees: Major budget carriers such as RyanAir require online check-in or charge fees (typically 20â‚¬ to 
40â‚¬, which at today's exchange rates would be about $25 to $50 US dollars). Connecting flights: Try to leave a 
good amount of time between connecting flights. Many of the discount carriers advise 2 to 4 hours; most of them 
are reluctant to provide a wide range of options to those who miss their connecting flight. Keep in mind that you will 
have booked the flights individually, and therefore will need to obtain checked luggage and then re-check it at the 
connecting airport (a potentially time consuming). Few amenities: Expect to bring your own sources 
of entertainment and any food or beverages you wish to consume. Budget airlines generally won't have these 
amenities on the flight. SummaryWith major airlines abandoning all pretense of luxury, you have less to lose (and 
more to save) by flying with budget airlines. European budget airlines are expanding to American airports, so make 
these airlines your first stop in your search for a cheap ticket to Europe[16]. Here's a list of some of the major 
European budget airlines accessible in the U.S. Have you flown with a European budget airline? Tell us about your 
experiences in the comments.Read More: [ 1]: https://www.moneyunder30.com/how-to-teach-english-as-a-second-

May 26, 2017( New Europe: http://neurope.eu Delivered by Newstex)  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share 
on Google+ Share on LinkedInThe biggest European air carrier in Europe, Ryanair, maybe force to stop selling 
flights from the UK to popular destinations in the EU by December 2018, The Irish Times reported on Thursday. 
Following a press conference on Wednesday, it appears aviation is facing what is called a Brexit cliff-edge dilemma, 
that is, the threat of disruption of services that forces companies to preempt relocation. 
It now transpires that without a Brexit deal by 2018, the company will not be issuing tickets from the UK for 2019. 
Because airlines plan their seasonal schedules months in advance, Ryanair must decide in 2018 where it will base 
its aircraft for the 2019 season. If by 2018 there is no agreement between Brussels and London on the UK's 
participation in the Open Skies agreement, then Ryanair will have to move its fleet, its CEO Michael O'Leary 
explained on Wednesday. The Open Skies[1] agreement comes with accepting the jurisdiction of the European 
Court of Justice rulings and freedom of movement, which is unlikely for the UK to accept. Alternatively, Ryanair's 
CEO suggests there could be a bilateral agreement, which however must be approved by 26 national parliaments. 
Nonetheless, For the time being, the Irish company made clear that they will not be basing new aircraft in the UK for 
2017 or 2018. The point about the ratification of a Brexit trade deal, including an agreement on aviation, may not be 
entirely accurate. That is the bottom line of a European Court of Justice ruling on May 16 on the ratification of the 
proposed EU-Singapore deal. However, it is clear that 'no deal' would have a devastating effect both for Europe's 
major tourist destinations and for the UK's aviation industry.Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+

EU Referendum

May 24, 2017( EU Referendum: http://www.eureferendum.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Predictably - and entirely as 
predicted - the UK media have largely given up on Brexit. No doubt, what passes for normal service will be resumed 
in due course, along with what's left of an uninspiring general election campaign.Of the English-language press, 
that leaves the Irish carrying the torch, with RTÃ‰ News flying the flag[1] for its favourite son Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair chief executive. O'Leary was holding forth on the British prospects for Brexit, asserting that the "political 
imperative in Europe" is that the British will "suffer on the way out the door". He believes there will be a hard border 
with Northern Ireland and no free movement of people. The common travel area will also come under severe strain. 
His view was that "you cannot have Britain be seen to leave the EU and not suffer". British people, he said, are 
deluding themselves because they are only talking to themselves and reading UK newspapers with a constant diet 
of "utter rubbish" about how they will negotiate a great deal for Britain. As one might expect, he is concerned for the 
future of his business, worried that the UK is taking itself out of the "Open Skies" arrangements with the EU - the 
thrust of my piece[2] in January. But O'Leary is racking up the pain, telling us that, after March 2019, there could be 
a period where there are no flights to the UK. People here might have to go back to "using the boats", he stated.  
This may be an exaggeration but the way Mrs May is playing it - alongside David Davis - talking up the "no deal" 
scenario, is one sure way of making it happen. Unless there is a formal EU-UK agreement to replace the internal 
EU arrangements that currently apply, things are going get sticky. As it stands, though, we have no information on 
how matters can progress. The options, though, are limited: the UK can either negotiate and agree a stand-alone 
bilateral access agreement, or the agreement can be embedded into a wider-ranging free trade agreement.Here, 
though, I'm also reminded of a piece I wrote in July 2014[3] about the EU's external aviation policy, though which 
the EU has taken over the responsibility on behalf of all Member States for concluding agreements with third 
countries. Thus, on the face of it, when the UK leaves the EU, not only do the access arrangements with the EU fall, 
all the other external agreements fall. That includes those with the United States and all other countries in the world. 
The point, though, is that we have no idea of what the UK government has in mind. Yet, with such an important 
industry, where any disruption will have a huge impact on the travelling public and the economy, we should not be 
guessing. There should be a clear outline of policy and, buy now, a degree of certainty. All we get, though, are 
reports such as this[4] with notes the almost complete silence from the political parties on commercial aviation, 
including the Conservative. This leads Andrew Swaffield[5] from, chief executive of Monarch, the holiday charter 
airline, to observe that we could end up with higher air fares, less choice and possibly even a return to 1970s air 
charter days. "Fares will gradually go up and there will be less competition", he says. But if O'Leary has it right, 
these are the least of our worries. The potential for catastrophic disruption is not academic. For sure, we all expect 
the new government, most probably led by Mrs May, to deal with this issue, but this can only be a supposition. We 
Brexit: aviation imponderables
have had absolutely nothing bankable - in fact, nothing at all - which would point to a resolution.  Nor is this made 
easier by the EU. At the ned of 2015, it published its Aviation Strategy for Europe[6] outlining plans that reach up to 
2019, complete with significant revisions to existing legislation. On top of this, the Commission in 20016[7] was 
authorised by the Council to open negotiations in order to conclude bilateral air safety agreements with third 
countries (China and Japan) and EU-level aviation agreements with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 
Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Armenia. For the EU, therefore, aviation policy is very much work in 
progress and Brexit can only be an unwelcome complication. In addition to everything else, it must now open up 
complex negotiations with the UK, while the UK itself must open negotiations with the rest of the world to make its 
own access agreements. And here, it gets doubly complicated. The current policy stems from a 2002 ECJ ruling 
that bilateral aviation agreements of Member States with third countries were in breach of fundamental provisions of 
the EU Treaty. The intervening fifteen years have led to the current policy matrix, with a network of international 
agreements, of which the UK is part. Such agreements are based on reciprocity, with the EU able leverage UK 
access in brokering terms with third countries. There is good reason, therefore, to suggest that the EU will also 
have to renegotiate some if not all of its third country deals. In other word, the entire international aviation 
settlement is at risk of unravelling. Oddly, that gives us some leverage. There is no gain for either the EU or the UK 
in disrupting current arrangements. So, as long as the UK is prepared to re-adopt relevant EU regulation - and 
commit to taking on board the revisions and additions as they arrive - and as long as the EU is prepared (and able) 
to revise its own internal arrangements, then the status quo will prevail. This will require the EU to amend its own 
law to allow UK airlines to continue to be "community airlines", allowing them to benefit from the third country 
agreements already in place. But that means, in terms of aviation policy, we will remain bound to the EU and have 
no more autonomy, post-Brexit, than we do now. Then we also have to factor in Air Traffic Management[8] and the 
Single European Sky, about which next to nothing has been written. Yet this is an 18-year-old programme that must 
be revisited in detail. For there to be continuity of commercial aviation services (freight as well as passenger traffic) 
of these complications will have to be address and resolved within the space of less than two years, allowing time 
for the EU to produce and bring into force amendments to legislation which normally take many years to prepare. 
Recently, Michel Barnier himself, in his speech to the Irish Parliament[9] warned that air connections between the 
UK and EU could be "severely hampered" if Brexit goes wrong. And that might be something of an understatement. 
Bluntly, even with the best will in the world, with all parties focusing on the problems and devoting all the necessary 
resources to resolving them, getting the arrangements in place for Brexit would be a considerable stretch. Yet all 
the indications are that the issue is not even formally on the agenda. Quite often, I am accused of undue pessimism 
on Brexit, but I can only call it as I see it. Clearly, there are complicated issues to resolve here, and when the chief 
executive of a major airline starts talking of international flights shutting down, we really need to listen. Even if this is 
hyperbole, there is enough of a threat for us to take the issues very seriously. And when they don't even appear to 
be 
on 
anyone's 
agenda, 
then 
is 
the 
time 
to 
get 
very 
worried 
indeed.

May 23, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In a bid to cope with the 
anticipated rush during the upcoming summer season, Alaska Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air 
Group ALK[1] has started offering non-stop flights connecting Philadelphia and Portland, Oregon. The flights are 
operating on a daily basis from May 22 until Aug 26.Notably, Alaska Airlines is utilizing the fuel-efficient Boeing 737 
planes for operating the flights. In fact, Alaska Air Group is on an expansion spree ever since it acquired Virgin 
America in late 2016.We expect, the introduction of the new seasonal service to find favor among passengers in the 
route as it widens their choices for travel with the summer season fast approaching. 
We remind investors that Airlines for America ('A4A') - the trade organization for leading U.S. airlines - recently 
projected[2] that the summer of 2017 will be the busiest one of all times for American carriers in terms of air 
travel.Apart from the above update, Alaska Airlines was also in the news when it announced a frequent flyer 
partnership with European carrier Finnair. This customer friendly move aims to provide the members of the 
program, at Alaska as well as Finnair, the opportunity to earn miles/points on flights of either carrier. In fact, Finnair 
is expected to start its West Coast service to Helsinki from Alaska Airlines' San Francisco hub from June this 
year.Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/ALK/fundamental/price Alaska Air Group, Inc. 
Price[3] | Alaska Air Group, Inc. Quote[4]Zacks Rank ...y PicksAlaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Better-ranked stocks in the airline space include United Continental Holdings UAL[5], Deutsche Lufthansa 
DLAKY[6] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[7] sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list 
of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8]. We note that shares of Lufthansa, Ryanair and United Continental have 
gained 41.8%, 21% and 8.3%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into

May 22, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Latin American carrier 
Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA[1] reported impressive traffic data for the month of April 2017. Traffic - measured in 
revenue passenger miles (RPMs) - came in at 1.55 billion, up 16.5% on a year-over-year basis.Also, consolidated 
capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) rose 6.3% to 1.86 billion on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, the load 
factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers climbed 730 basis points (bps) to 83.4% in Apr 2017 as traffic 
growth exceeded capacity expansion.In the first four months of 2017, Copa Holdings generated RPMs of 6.28 
billion (up 11.4% year over year) and ASMs of 7.67 billion (up 4.8%). Load factor registered growth of 490 bps year 
over year to 81.9%, during the period.In fact, the impressive traffic report provides some relief to Copa Holdings. 
This is because the stock has suffered over the last few trading sessions particularly on Thursday due to the 
political scandal[2] in Brazil relating to its President Michel Temer. 
Not only did the Copa Holdings stock plummet, its peers in the Latin American aviation space like GOL Linhas 
GOL[3] also suffered due to the event.Despite the above sell-off, we note that the Copa Holdings stock has 
performed impressively so far this year. Evidently, shares of the company have rallied 19.2% on a year-to-date 
basis compared with the Zacks categorized Transportation-Airline[4] industry's gain of 7.9%.Zacks Rank ...ocks to

May 18, 2017( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  APWith demand for 
air travel in Europe growing at an impressive rate, the need for world-class airports is at an all-time high. Leading 
aviation reviewer Skytrax recently released the results of its annual World Airport Awards, which includes a list of 
the best in Europe. The Skytrax annual rankings are based on the impressions of nearly 14 million fliers from 105 
countries. 
More than 550 airports were included in the survey, which covers 39 service and performance parameters[1], 
including facility comfort, the location of bathrooms, and the language skills of the airport staff. 10. Cologne Bonn 
Airport (CGN) Flickr/Damian WitkowskiYearly passengers: 10.3 million Previous rank: 8 Why it's awesome: Located 
just 15 kilometers (9 miles) southeast of Cologne, Germany, CGN is a major hub for the budget carrier 
Germanwings.  Skytrax reviewers praised the airport for its modern architecture and its clean and efficient terminal 
buildings. Source: Skytrax World Airport Awards. Yearly passenger figure is for 2015, provided by Cologne Bonn 
Airport[2].9. Hamburg Airport (HAM) Wikimedia CommonsYearly passengers: 16.2 million Previous rank: N/A Why 
it's awesome: Over the past few years, Hamburg Airport has developed into a regional power â€” serving as a major 
hub for a host of low-cost airlines including Eurowings, EasyJet, and Ryanair.  For 2017, Skytrax named Hamburg 
the best regional airport in Europe.  Source: Skytrax World Airport Awards. Yearly passenger figure is for 2016,

million Previous rank: 10 Why it's awesome: Located just 12 miles from the heart of Austria's capital and largest 
city, Skytrax reviewers praised the airport for its cleanliness, compact size, and speedy wi-fi connectivity. Vienna

May 16, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Southwest 
Airlines Co. LUV[1] gained 6.05% in the last one month, outperforming the Zacks categorized Transportation - 
Airline[2] industry's gain of 4.62% over the same period.Southwest Airlines' employee-friendly approach is 
impressive. In Feb 2017, the carrier paid $586 million to its employees as part of its profit-sharing plan for 
2016. The 2016 payment equates to approximately 13.2% of each employee's earnings in the year. 
We are also appreciative of the company's efforts to enhance shareholders' wealth through dividends and share 
buybacks. In the first quarter of 2017, the company returned $673 million to shareholders through a combination of 
dividends and share repurchases.At the end of the first quarter, Southwest Airlines had cash and cash equivalents 
of $1,851 million, compared with $1,680 million at the end of 2016. As of Mar 31, 2017, the company had long-term 
debt (less current maturities) of $2,781 million, compared with $2,821 million at the end of 2016.The carrier 
generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion in first-quarter 2017.The carrier's second-quarter guidance for operating 
revenue per available seat miles also raises optimism. The metric is expected to grow in the band of 1% to 2% on a 
year-over-year basis. The carrier posted impressive traffic numbers for the month of April. Traffic (measured in 
revenue passenger miles or RPMs) rose 8.4%, while consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) inched 
up 7.6%. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased 60 basis points to 84% in Apr 2017, as 
traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. In view of the positives, we believe investors should hold onto 
Southwest Airlines' stock for now.Zacks Rank ...y PicksSouthwest Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
A few better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Deutsche Lufthansa AG DLAKY[3], Ryanair Holdings PLC 
RYAAY[4] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[5]. All of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6].Shares of Deutsche Lufthansa and Ryanair Holdings 
gained over 43% and 21%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis. SkyWest has an impressive earnings history. The 
company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with a positive earnings surprise of 
13.81%.5 Trades Could Profit "Big-League" from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until 
you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks 
reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher 
interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure. See these buy recommendations now >>[7]Want

May 15, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Alaska Air 
Group ALK[1] lost 13.55% in the last three months, underperforming the Zacks categorized Transportation - 
Airline[2] industry's gain of 2.57% in the same period as costs related to its acquisition of Virgin America are hurting 
earnings growth. Merger-related costs hurt the bottom-line in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, the bottom 
line contracted 27.6% on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs. Revenues, however, grew 29.8% on a year-
over-year basis, mainly due to the expanded product portfolio following the Virgin America purchase.Even though 
the bottom line contracted, the company managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter of 
2017. We note that Alaska Air Group has an impressive history with respect to earnings, having outshined the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters.We are impressed by the company's move to hike its 
quarterly dividend by 9% to 30 cents per share. 
During 2016, the company returned $329 million to shareholders through buybacks ($193 million) and dividend 
payments ($136 million).We are also positive on the U.S. Transportation Department's decision to award 
(tentatively) Mexico City slots to the carrier. The company's acquisition of Virgin America is a huge positive. 
Following the acquisition, Alaska Air Group has expanded significantly, particularly along the West Coast.At the end 
of the first quarter, the company had $1,710 million in cash and marketable securities, compared with $1,580 million 
at the end of 2016. Long-term debt also reduced to $2,531 million in the quarter from $2,645 million at the end of 
2016. Moreover, adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio was 58%, compared with 59% at 2016-end.In view of the 
positives, we believe Alaska Air Group's stock should be retained by investors for now.Zacks Rank ...y PicksAlaska 
Air Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Deutsche

May 12, 2017( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Gol Linhas Aereas 
Inteligentes SA GOL[1] recently reported air traffic numbers for the month of April. Consolidated traffic - measured 
in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) - improved 6.9% to 2.7 billion in Apr 2017 on a year-over-year 
basis. International and domestic RPK in the month rose 3.2% and 7.4%, respectively.Consolidated capacity (or 
available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 2.6% year over year to 3.4 billion, primarily buoyed by a 3.2% increase 
in domestic capacity. The metric, however, contracted 1.5% on the international front. Load factor - percentage of 
seats filled by passengers - rose 320 basis points (bps) to 79% (on a consolidated basis) in Apr 2017. This can be 
attributed to the fact that traffic growth was higher than capacity expansion in the month. 
The company recorded a 5.6% reduction in number of seats in April, while volume of departures decreased 
6.2%.On a year-to-date basis, consolidated RPK was up 2% while ASK slipped 1%. Load factor for the same period 
increased 230 bps to 79.4%.Gol Linhas recently reported first-quarter 2017 earnings numbers. Earnings per share 
of $1.06 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents by a significant margin. However, the bottom line 
contracted 23.2% on a year-over-year basis, due to escalating costs. Net revenue in the first quarter of 2017 came 
in 
at 
$841.2

May 09, 2017( New Europe: http://neurope.eu Delivered by Newstex)  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share 
on Google+ Share on LinkedInSeven European pension funds managing â‚¬300bn in assets are offloading Ryanair 
from their portfolio due to the Irish Airliners' controversial labour tactics, FT reported on Monday. The pension funds 
find the Irish company ethically controversial. 
Among the pension funds are the Danish ATP, Sam, and PFA, the Swedish Folksam, the UK Asset Manager Baillie 
Gifford, and the business consultancy Hermes EOS. PKA is required to comply with guidelines for ethical 
investment, which it feels have been violated both in Denmark and in France. In 2015, Ryanair was instructed by a 
Danish tribunal to sign a collective bargaining agreement with Danish crews, rather than signing an Irish contract 
with them. Rather than comply, Ryanair services Copenhagen with Lithuanian-based crews. In 2013, French courts 
fined Ryanair â‚¬9 million for obliging local crews to sign Irish contracts. Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said the 
pension funds were 'idiots' and 'misinformed,' as the company has not had a strike for over a decade. He also 
underscored that he 'couldn't care less' as Ryanair has a supportive investment base. Ryanair is notorious for 
signing individual contracts and taking on trade unions across Europe. In July 2015, Ryanair initiated a public online 
campaign aimed at banning the right to strike of air traffic controllers, entitled 'Keep Europe's Skies Open[1]'. The 
company aimed at obtaining the one million petition signatures required to 'urge' the EU Commission and the 
European Parliament to take action. The company wanted nothing less than removing the right to strike from ATC 
unions, bringing Europe in line with the US regime. In parallel, the company proceeded to what is in effect a 
'lockout,' closing down its base in Denmark, Copenhagen, to resettle in Kaunus, Lithuania. The Danish 
Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) responded by saying that strikes against Ryanair will take place not only in 
Copenhagen but also in Billund and Aarhus. The company warned that Ryanair would respond in kind, shutting 
down bases in Denmark. It did. Ryanair has been investigated and cautioned by the European Commission multiple 
times[2] for its labour practices. However, these are an O'Leary[3]'s trademark. The Irish CEO gained his 
experience during the period of deregulation of airlines in the US (Southwest Airlines), transferring the model to 
Europe. He took the Irish carrier from 5,000 passengers and one aircraft to transform it into the biggest Airline in 
Europe.

vid writes:* Currently, all major airlines in the world have a home-base; an airport from which a majority of their 
flights operate from. For KLM this is Schiphol Amsterdam, and for American Airlines, this is Dallas/Fort Worth 
international airport. 
These main airports function as a hub and link with smaller airports called 'spokes'. This networking system quickly 
and unexpectedly developed from 1978 onwards after the deregulation of the airline industry in the US, but it was 
not incorporated by all airlines, and is contrasted by a different networking strategy called 'point-to-point' which is 
mostly used by budget airlines - which I will refer to as LCC; lower-cost-carrier - like Ryanair and Southwest 
Airlines. In this post I will discuss why the hub-and-spoke system developed in the airline industry, and explain the 
economics behind this system.When in 1978 the 'Airline Deregulation Act' was introduced it was expected that the 
industry would keep developing a linear and point-to-point system as it had been operating under the regulation. 
However, relatively quickly almost all airlines developed a hub-and-spoke networking system (H... to capture the 
passenger from the origin to the destination. A lot of airlines that did operate a point-to-point network mostly failed. 
For a more extensive history on the development of the airline industry you should read Flying off Course by Rigas 
Doganis.The concept of hubbing was developed for a more effective transportation of passengers. It requires that 
flights from different airports, which are at the spokes of a network, arrive at the hub at approximately at the same 
time. This enables passengers and baggage to connect with different flights in a relatively short time, after which all 
the planes leave in a wave of departures. This whole process is called a complex, and by timing a complex correctly 
it was possible to do multiple a day. American Airlines for example has around 8 complexes a day at Dallas-Fort 
Worth.https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2P5LcDhUeMM/WQYSYnr5i5I/AAAAAAABW6E/aEGJT9CYNL0X-
t4IMVdeAMBt2y2rCHbnQCLcB/s1600/AmericanAirlines_Routes.pngThe economic benefit of the hub-and-spoke 
system is that it is optimized to cover a large geographical area. Passengers can travel between any two cities in 
the route system with one connecting stop at the hub. It enables a complete coverage of an entire network with the 
least amount of routes. For example if you have 10 destinations, with the H...ystem you would only need 9 routes to 
connect all the airports, whereas an airliner would need 45 routes if it used the point-to-point system. This system 
also immediately has the added benefit of 'economies of scale' as explained in this great paper[1] [pdf]. Because 
passengers arrive at the hub airport in waves, the airline can offer more seats per route which decreases the cost 
per seat. Second, there is also the advantage of density, due to this system of complexes routes can be served 
The development and economics of airline networking
multiple times a day, with little down time on the ground. The benefits of density and scale according to Gerald N. 
Cook in this paper[2] make it easier for airlines to add another connection because it requires only one extra route, 
and 
little 
extra 
capital 
cost.

hIbdmK73GHyZyjiyjwCLcB/s1600/Southwest_Routes.pngHowever, the limits to the H...ystem are becoming 
apparent with the rise of LCC's. First, Gerald argues that a large amount of passenger have a hub airport already 
as their origin airport and therefore all the services that are in place to accommodate connecting passengers are an 
extra expense. Furthermore, extra stops at a hub are expensive due to extra ground time, landing fees. and a 
significant increase in fuel consumption during landing, taxiing, and take-of. Third, flights from hub airports are 
susceptible to delays due to capacity constraints and unpredictable circumstances such as a snow storm at 
Heathrow can delay a multitude of connecting flights.Bottom line: The airline industry has developed two networking 
structures, with the hub-and-spoke system being the most prominent one. Although this system has the benefits of 
economies of scale and density, the limits and downsides are becoming more visible. * Please comment on these 
posts by students in my growth ...velopment economics course. It really helps if you highlight unclear analysis,

Apr 30, 2017( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Three Marketing Ideas You 
Wouldn't Bet On, but Actually Worked In the world of marketing there are only two types of campaigns: the ones 
that work and the ones that don't. While true marketing experts usually have a better shot at figuring out the winning 
campaigns, sometimes success boils down to being lucky at the right time with the right market. For instance, there 
have been some marketing campaigns that common sense would say are doomed to fail, but these schemes 
excelled. In most cases, the main reasons for success are due to social media[1] and word-of-mouth. 
The benefit of using this form of cost-effective marketing when done right is it can cause a marketing campaign to 
go viral. Here are 3 examples of some wild marketing ideas that actually worked. Germanwings 'Planemob' Back in 
2010, Germanwings, a discount European air carrier, launched a video ad campaign which was part of the 
company's plan to compete with another European air carrier, Ryanair, known for its cheap flights within Europe 
and for notoriously charging customers for using the toilet. In the ad, passengers on a Ryanair flight - who were 
purposely planted by Germanwing - held up cardboard signs with complaints and sarcastic comments that 
essentially poked fun at Ryanair's shortcomings. The video ended with a plug for Germanwings: 'Next time, let's just 
fly Germanwings.' The Germanwings' 'planemob' campaign[2] essentially involved a flip camera and a few cheap 
plane tickets used by people to hold up basic signs. It went viral on YouTube gaining nearly 400,000 views. The No 
Bonus Casino  Online casinos are well known for offering rewarding promotions to attract customers to their sites. 
Promotions are the main marketing campaigns run by iGaming destinations. However, one particular online casino 
brand doesn't offer its players any bonuses. Aptly called the 'No Bonus Casino', the brand is bonus-free. It offers 
players a fantastic range of gambling entrainment, including games tied to big jackpots, but no bonuses of any kind. 
Don't believe it? Check out this No Bonus Casino review[3]. While this no bonus approach might seem like more of 
an Achilles heel than a victory for the casino, the opposite is true, with many players enjoying the brand's no-
nonsense approach. Volta Ferrorama's toy train event Volta Ferrorama's campaign[4] involving a toy train is well-
known in Brazil. The Brazilian company wanted to see if their once popular toy train (discontinued in 1989) would 
attract a new generation of children. Its parent company, Manufatura de Brinquedos Estrela, staged an event that 
was amplified via the news media, Facebook and Twitter, which engaged tens of thousands of fans, resulted in over 
600,000 YouTube views and reached Twitter's trending topics in Brazil three separate times. The leading fan group 
of Ferrorama put together an effort to have the toy train travel an uninterrupted 20 km through city streets and 
beyond. Volunteers who took part continuously moved the track to keep the train going to reach to the travel 
distance 
goal. 
The 
campaign 
was 
a 
success 
and 
the 
toy 
was 
re-launched.

May 01, 2017( CapitalCube: http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/ Delivered by Newstex)  Our analysis is based on 
comparing ANA HOLDINGS INC. with the following peers - Ryanair Holdings Plc, SAS AB, Deutsche Lufthansa AG 
and Icelandair Group hf (RYA-GB, SAS-DK, LHA-DE and ICEAIR-IS). ANA HOLDINGS INC.'s dividend yield is 
1.80 percent and its dividend payout is 21.25 percent. This compares to a peer median dividend yield of 1.28 
percent and a payout level of 9.11 percent. 
This type of dividend performance might make it a good stock for dividend investors. In addition, the company's 
relatively good dividend quality score of 83 out of a possible score of 100 points to some sustainability of its robust 
payout ratio, and underscores its attractiveness for dividend investors seeking current income. Dividend Quality 
Overview Over the last twelve months (prior to March 31, 2017), 0Q09-GB[1] paid a high quality dividend, which 
represents a yield of 1.82% at the current price. Dividend quality trend has not been consistent over the last five 
years. Dividends were paid during each of these years â€” of these 3 were high quality and 2 were low quality. The 
ending cash balance, with a dividend coverage of 17.95x, provides a substantial cushion in case of a significant 
reduction of cash flows in the future.Quadrant label definitions. Hover to know moreHigh Score;High Yield, High 
Score;Low Yield, Low Score;Low Yield, Low Score;High Yield Dividend CoverageOver the last twelve months (prior 
to March 31, 2017), 0Q09-GB[2] paid a high quality dividend. The source of the company's cash to support the 
dividend paid over the last twelve months is operating cash flow (coverage of 13.55x), investing cash flow 
(coverage of -11.13x), issuance cash flow (coverage of 1.19x) and twelve-month prior cash (coverage of 14.83x), 
for a total dividend coverage of 18.95x.These coverage ratio factors imply that the firm's dividends are wholly paid 
from operating and investing cash flows net of any debt repayments, which suggests a high dividend quality.

Liverpool this summer. The campaign will promote Cork city and county and will highlight Cork Airport as a gateway 
to the Wild Atlantic Way, and will reach about 5.5m people across Britain. Kicking off on 24th April, it will run until

Apr 21, 2017( BANG ShowBiz: http://www.bangshowbiz.com Delivered by Newstex)  Jo Wood has lashed out at 
EasyJet after being kicked off an overbooked flight. The former wife of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and 
her partner Paul Scarborough were booked to fly from Murcia in Spain to Gatwick in London earlier this week with 
the low-cost airline, when they discovered that EasyJet only had one seat for them both.Jo explained during an 
appearance on 'Good Morning Britain': "I arrived at Murcia Airport, checked in, had no luggage, went through 
security and had my boarding pass."Just before we were about to go onto the plane, they pulled us aside. 
because I was with my fella, and said 'one of you can get on and one of you has to stay'."I said 'hold on a minute 
this is ridiculous, I bought my ticket three weeks ago, why should we stay?' We've bought our tickets. And they said 
they had overbooked."I reckon it's because we had no luggage, we were easy to take off. I was furious because I 
had to get back for work the next day."They didn't stand there and ask who would come off the flight! Nobody said 
that - they just took us aside."Jo, 62, and her 53-year-old partner ended up paying to fly home on a later flight on 
Ryanair instead. Jo fumed: "They picked on the wrong woman, didn't they? Picked on the wrong woman, they did. 
They must have thought, 'She won't complain, she looks very sweet, she hasn't got any luggage so we don't have 
to drag her luggage off the flight, that's fine, we'll pick on that girl, Jo.' Little did they know."An EasyJet spokesman 
said: "We were sorry to hear of Miss Wood's experience and would like to sincerely apologize for the 
inconvenience."While there was one seat available, we understand that she wanted to fly with her travel 
companion. We have been in contact with Miss Wood directly to apologize."MailOnline reports that Jo will be given 
a full refund for the Ryanair flights, Â£167 for her EasyJet flights and Â£120 for a taxi to her home in London.

Apr 11, 2017( Slugger O'Toole: http://www.sluggerotoole.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  If there is one advantage to 
having kids it is that it does increase your circle of friends. Humans need social contact, especially when going 
through the misery joy of having your first child. We compare notes with other parents, we sympathise when they 
tell you their baby is not sleeping even though inside we are delighted that at least our kid is not as bad as there's. 
We force a smile when another parent tells us how their little darling slept all night from three weeks. 
Bringing up a child is a surprising competitive sport. Anyway, one of our baby buddies is a nice German couple. 
Dispute our local cynicism the foreigners I come across love living in Belfast. Sure, the buses never turn up on time 
and there is dogsh*t everywhere but they like the friendliness of the people. This German couple were happy 
working away in a local pharmaceutical company, enjoying life in Belfast and all was right in the world. Until, you 
guessed it, Brexit. Although it has not even happened yet the uncertainty is enough for foreign workers to start 
packing their bags. In the case of the German couple, they have a second child on the way. Before Brexit, they 
planned to buy a house in Belfast now there is just too much uncertainty. Instead, they are busy applying for jobs in 
Germany and Switzerland. Also, there is a feeling of the UK just do not want us anymore so feck ya we are out of 
here. Their company has quite a few foreign workers and they are not alone in looking at the exit. Already the 
company is so short staffed that they are offering staff 6 grand if they help them recruit someone into the more 
niche vacant roles - 6 grand! To stem the exit flood the company is offering to pay the costs of applying for your 
leave to remain status. But anyone who has ever dealt with Home Office Immigration will know that it is a 
Kafkaesque process so frustrating it will have you booking your Ryanair flight out of here faster than you can say 
Nigel Farage. You see the thing Brexiters do not seem to realise is you can't magic skilled workers out of thin air. 
From Health to IT practically every sector of our economy has a skills shortage. The NHS for example would simply 
not be able to function is all the foreign staff upped and left. I hear at a local college for some courses EU 
applications are down 20% already. Recruitment is also taking a hit with EU staff not taking up job offers. The thing 
about highly mobile skilled workers is that they are er highly mobile. They are already living the life of an expat, it 
does not matter to them if it is Belfast, Dublin, Amsterdam or Berlin. If your host country does not want you there 
are 100 other countries who will be delighted to welcome you. Even at the other extreme of the jobs market for 
unskilled work farms, hospitality industry and companies like Moypark just could not survive without foreign 
workers. But Brexiters will say it's not about kicking out the foreigners it is about taking back control. That as may 
be but talk to a few foreign workers and get their take on it. Discouraging the brightest and the best from coming to 
the UK is economic suicide. Making the workers that are here feel unwelcome is just plain daft.RelatedAbout Brian

Apr 11, 2017( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  How following economics 
101 could have prevented United's PR nightmare Courtesy of Volodymyr Bilotkach[1], Newcastle University[2]  The 
not so friendly skies? United plane via            www.shutterstock.com[3]  On April 9, a passenger was forcibly 
removed[4] from a United Airlines flight from Chicago O'Hare to Louisville after the carrier was unable to find 
volunteers to accommodate four of its employees on standby.  Dramatic videos[5] of the incident have gone viral on 
YouTube and social networks, and I reckon the resulting cost of this PR disaster will likely make United's CEO wish 
he had sent in a private jet to ferry those employees to Louisville (which the airline could easily have afforded, given 
its net income[6] of US$2.3 billion in 2016). Many articles[7] have reported that airlines routinely overbook their 
flights, and sometimes passengers have to accept (voluntarily or not) the inconvenience of getting to their 
destination later than planned. 
As an airline economist, I do not recall, however, such a situation ever escalating to the level it did on that United 
flight. The incident raises many questions, including why airlines overbook and what the carrier could have done 
differently. Play Video[8] Airline economics 101: Why they overbook Overbooking is indeed something that the 
airlines routinely do, and it represents a rational behavior for a carrier that sells some of its tickets as fully 
refundable contracts (mostly to business customers who pay the highest rates). While the last few years have 
generally been good for airline profitability[9], the brutal truth is that profit margins have been rather low historically. 
Airlines rank[10] below most other industries in terms of return on invested capital, according to the International Air 
Transport Association. An airline that does not overbook risks finding itself in a situation in which several 
cancellations from high-yield passengers flying on refundable fares (the most expensive airlines offer) can turn a 
profitable flight into a loss-making one. Airlines have quite a lot of information[11] on cancellation patterns for 
different flights, and they decide on how many seats to overbook based on this. Overbooking has likely contributed 
to the rising 'load factors' in the U.S. airline industry. Load factors - the share of airline seats occupied by 
passengers - on U.S. domestic flights have gone up[12] from just under 80 percent in 2007 to almost 85 percent in 
2016. Keeping airplanes as full as possible clearly helps airlines stay in the black. Of the major U.S. and European 
airlines, only Ryanair[13] does not deliberately overbook its flights, to my knowledge. To the best of my knowledge, 
the airline industry is the only one that practices overbooking. This is done mostly because it is comparably easy for 
the airlines to provide their passengers with alternative ways of getting to their final destination. For instance, United 
provides five daily flights from Chicago to Louisville, giving the airline quite a bit of flexibility. Ins and outs of 
overbooking So what happens if a flight is overbooked? The airline starts by looking for volunteers, offering the 
passengers travel vouchers or sometimes cash for taking a later flight. U.S. and European airlines are technically 
How following economics 101 could have prevented United 's PR nightmare
not required to offer anything to the passengers for voluntarily giving up their seat (the law stipulates only that the 
airline and the passenger come to an agreement on conditions under which the passenger volunteers to take a 
different flight), but most airlines tend to offer travel vouchers. If not enough volunteers are found, passengers will 
be bumped off involuntarily, in which case, both U.S.[14] and EU laws[15] require airlines to provide financial 
compensation to the passengers. The airlines take your 'status' and other factors into account, so you are less likely 
to be denied boarding if you are traveling on an expensive fare or hold an elite status in the airline's frequent flier 
program. Pro tip: In both jurisdictions, laws provide for compensation in cash. So if you are offered travel vouchers 
in return for being involuntarily denied boarding, it is your right to refuse and demand cash compensation instead. 
UA3411 veers off course Basically, this is where things went wrong for UA3411. Because United could not get 
enough volunteers, it started the process of removing passengers from the plane involuntarily, and chose four at 
random. Since taking off with more than the maximum allowed number of passengers on board is a serious 
violation of safety rules, the airline has every right to ensure that there are no extra people on board when the 
aircraft taxis from the gate. The issue in this case, in my opinion, is that United did not do all it could to prevent the 
situation from escalating to the point where it became what will likely be an expensive PR issue, if not a legal and 
political[16] one. Even if just 1,000 passengers decide over the next month to fly with a rival instead of United 
because of this incident, we are talking about a third of a million dollars in lost revenue, giving the current average 
airfare[17] of about $340. And that's without factoring in the cost of repairing the airline's image (which explains why 
its shares tanked[18] on the stock market). Simple economics What could United have done differently? From the 
point of view of economics, the airline's inability to find volunteers means that the compensation offered was too 
low. Some accounts[19] of the incident suggest that the airline offered $400 for the passengers to volunteer to take 
a flight on the next day, and the offer was later raised to $800. While $800 seems like good money for the 
inconvenience, passengers apparently put a higher value than this on their desire to get to Louisville (recall that the 
flight in question was on Sunday evening). In fact, I guess your boss would be more sympathetic with you missing a 
day at work if this were due to the airline bumping you off a flight than you volunteering to spend a night away 
(especially since you will end up with a travel voucher or cash in your pocket either way). Regardless, the airline 
would definitely have found volunteers if it had kept increasing the offer. Whether the airlines' employees had the 
authority to do it is another matter, as the company may have put a limit on how much it could offer. More generally, 
to reduce the likelihood of involuntarily denying boarding to passengers in the future on oversold flights, airlines 
could introduce some sort of auction system to look for volunteers. The airlines could either gradually increase their 
compensation offer or even ask customers to name their own price for volunteering. It seems that Delta is already 
doing this, as a matter of fact[20]. Such a system should not be too onerous to implement. Airlines these days have 
plenty of ways to contact passengers via text or app. The entire process could be run without creating much fuss in 
the airport, and even in a way that few even are aware the flight was overbooked. A rare problem, big headache 
Fortunately, denied boarding is in general not a major issue for airlines. According to the Department of 
Transportation, less than one-tenth[21] of 1 percent of all passengers are denied boarding, and only one in 10 of 
those are involuntary. Still, airlines are well-equipped with all the data and related technologies needed to make 
sure that all the passengers on oversold flights are reaccommodated voluntarily - and are not involuntarily dragged 
off a plane in such a horrifying manner. I hope the incident on April 9 will make them consider making the 
appropriate investment into tackling this issue. Volodymyr Bilotkach[22], Senior Lecturer in Economics, Newcastle

It's Time for American and Delta to Reinstate Their Interline Agreement
It's Time for American and Delta to Reinstate Their Interline Agreement

Apr 10, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  I've wanted to write this post for 
a long time. In fact, I've had a blank post with this title sitting in my drafts folder since December. Now, the timing 
seems perfect considering the massive operational problems Delta faced last week[1] when storms sat on top of 
Atlanta and the northeast (and incredibly, continues to face in some ways). There is less and less differentiating low 
cost carriers from legacy airlines every day, but the ability to reacommodate when things go wrong is still one of the 
more important differences. 
In 2015, Delta decided its operation was so good that it wasn't as concerned about having agreements with other 
airlines. The end result was that American and Delta broke ties so they could no longer put stranded travelers on 
each other. This has gone on long enough. Figure it out, guys.I wrote about this back when the airlines broke off 
their agreement[2], but it's worth rehashing a bit of it here. Since the dawn of time (or something like that), airlines 
have had interline agreements with each other. This allowed them to issue a single ticket covering flights from both 
airlines, check bags through to each other, and reaccommodate passengers on each other when things go wrong. 
The first two are important today for airlines like JetBlue or Alaska which rely on partnerships with global airlines to 
get their customers where they need to go. But between the big legacy carriers, it's not as important as it used to 
be. The last piece, being able to reaccommodate people on each other when things go wrong, is valuable. The way 
it works is fairly simple. If two airlines have an interline agreement, they can either accept the other passenger at 
face value of the ticket or they can do it at a set percentage of a high fare. These things all get settled behind the 
scenes through an industry clearinghouse, so for the traveler and customer service rep, it's easy to handle. Low 
cost carriers have never really gone down this route. Historically they focused on, well, keeping costs low, and that 
meant avoiding things like checking bags to different airlines and giving away revenue to another airline in times of 
trouble. Southwest today still can't do it, so when things go wrong, it either has to buy a new, expensive last-minute 
ticket or it has to tell passengers they can either wait for the next Southwest flight or get a refund and find 
something on their own. It's not great for anyone. Southwest will finally have the ability to enter into these 
agreements with its new reservation system, but when you think about ultra low cost carriers like Spirit, Allegiant, 
Ryanair, or easyJet, this just hasn't been something they're willing to do. In this era of a la carte pricing and Basic 
Economy fares, the gap between legacy and even ultra low cost carriers has narrowed from a passenger 
perspective. But as mentioned, the ability and willingness to help passengers fly other airlines in times of trouble to 
me is one of the more valuable differentiators. Back in 2015 when Delta was running that fantastic operation, it 
decided to get greedy. It noted that with United and American running far worse operations, it was taking many 
more passengers from them than they were taking from Delta. And so Delta thought it could make a money-grab 
It's Time for American and Delta to Reinstate Their Interline Agreement
and jack up the rates it charged United and American to take their stranded passengers. I had trouble following that 
logic[3], but apparently Delta thought it made perfect sense. The reactions were very different. United caved and 
agreed to the higher rate. As its operation has improved, I'm sure the lopsided nature of the relationship has begun 
to settle out. But it's very expensive when things do go wrong, so presumably it's a last resort. In some cases, they 
may opt not to use each other at all. American, on the other hand, told Delta to pound sand. It wasn't going to agree 
to this and so the deal ended. Delta has generally continued to run a very good operation, but American and United 
are catching up. In the meantime, Delta has had some spectacular failures. There were the two computer 
outages[4] in the last year which snarled operations for days. And then there was this storm last week that really 
messed things up. Yes it's true that Atlanta had bad storms last week, but Delta wasn't able to prepare itself for a 
quick recovery. Days later, on Saturday, Delta had still canceled hundreds of flights. The airline kept delaying and 
delaying before canceling, making customers angrier and angrier every time. Phone lines were jammed; everything 
was gridlocked. Delta agents scrambled to find any remaining seat during the already busy Spring Break travel 
period, but many people were just out of luck. I bet Delta sure wished it could have routed some of those people on 
American to get them on their way. Having the ability to put people on the other big US airlines is an important tool, 
not only for customers but for employees too. You think Delta's front line people are having a good week telling their 
customers that if they want to get that seat on American they're on their own? Nope. There are some things that are 
negotiable, but this shouldn't be one of them. Go back to the status quo, accept industry standard settlement, and 
stop screwing around with customers and employees. With lower rates, even the airlines that do have agreements 
with each other will be more inclined to send people to the other airlines when things go wrong. This should be one 
of the big differentiators for a legacy airline. Now go make it happen so we don't run into this the next time there's a 
meltdown.

Zak Mir thinks the Ryanair Holdings Plc (LON:RYA) can add the best part of 20% to its share price over the 
summer months as he sets a â‚¬17 target for the stock. 'There's been a slow grind higher over the past six months 
that was from the October floor at the â‚¬11 level,' explains Mir in the latest Proactive Investors Bulletin Board. 'Since 
then a slowly rising 200-day moving average and a rising trend channel from as long ago as June last year. 'The 
implication is that at least while hold above the â‚¬14 area we could head as high as â‚¬17 at the top of the channel 
over the next three to four months.'

Mar 29, 2017( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  The low-cost airline said 
aviation should be treated as a matter of urgency in Brexit negotiations, as summer schedules for 2019 must be 
finalised by March next year, reports the Telegraph[1]. Without a bilateral agreement being struck with the EU, 
Britain will have to revert to historic WTO regulations that do not cover aviation, Ryanair said. The airline added that 
there was a 'distinct possibility of no flights between Europe and the UK' for a period from March 2019. Airlines plan 
their flights a year in advance, so will finalise their schedules for the summer of 2019 in the spring of 2018. 'Some 
nine months on from the Brexit referendum, we are no closer to knowing what effect it will have on aviation,' said 
Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs. 
'With Britain planning to leave the EU and its Open Skies agreement, there is a distinct possibility that there may be 
no flights between the UK and Europe for a period of time after March 2019.' Open Skies is an agreement between 
the EU and the US, which the UK will potentially be outside of if it leaves Europe without a replica of the deal.'The 
best we can hope for is a new bilateral agreement between the UK and EU,' Mr Jacobs added. 'However, we worry 
that Britain may not be able to negotiate such a bilateral in time for the release by airlines of summer 2019 
schedules in mid-2018.' Ryanair said it will carry more than 44m customers to and from British airports this year. It 
has already shifted growth into Europe and away from the UK, and will base no additional aircraft at its 19 airports 
in the country this year. [ 1]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/03/29/uk-could-have-no-flights-europe-

Are Airline Stocks Ready To Take Off?

Mar 29, 2017( Modest Money: http://www.modestmoney.com Delivered by Newstex)  The airline industry has 
historically been a turbulent one to invest in. And it makes sense. High capital costs and rarely making significant 
money tends to make investors jump ship at the slightest hint of bad news and jump along for the ride on any good 
news from airline stocks. 
So while you can't remove the turbulence from the industry, you can lessen it by investing in the best positioned 
airline stocks. This post is going to walk you through the 3 airline stocks that are most likely to make you some 
money and not be so turbulent that you need to call a flight attendant.3 Airline Stocks To Buy #1. JetBlue 
(NASDAQ: JBLU[1])When you think of airline stocks, you probably think of the big players first. But don't overlook 
little JetBlue. The company has been quietly gaining momentum and is in the process of cleaning up past mistakes. 
What past mistakes you might ask? The biggest issue JetBlue faces is one it created. It simply was too aggressive 
in its growth plans. As a result, revenue per available seat mile fell by 5%. The pain carries over to the first quarter 
of 2017 where revenue per available seat mile is expected to decline another 5%. But JetBlue is correcting its 
mistake. They are slowing expansion in 2017. They also announced a cost cutting initiative to achieve an annual 
structural cost savings by 2020 of $250-$300 million. Finally, the airline is adding more premium seat flights. The 
Mint routes, which are cross country routes that offer flat, bedlike premium seating, will expand to more cities in 
2017. Many travelers rave about these seats, so while demand is there, JetBlue should be able to add to the bottom 
line by offering more premium seats and more routes in 2017. In all, JetBlue is well positioned for the short term 
and the long term. As they slowly continue to expand operations, you can bet JetBlue will become a household 
name like the other major airlines.#2. Ryan Air (NASDAQ: RYAAY[2])Unless you have been to Europe, you 
probably are not aware of Ryan Air. They are the discount airline of Europe and they are a great company to invest 
in. Starting with the financials, the company's debt to equity ratio is much lower than the industry standard, sitting at 
105% and revenue has climbed each of the past 5 years. They are also slowing expanding East into more 
European markets where they have not had a footprint in previous years. This slow methodical growth will help the 
bottom line while not negatively impacting revenue per available seat mile. The only negative to Ryan Air is Brexit. 
The stock took a slight hit when the Brexit vote was announced, but the stock price has come back as investors 
know this is a good stock to own long term. Increasing revenues will be a challenge as there remains pressure on 
the Pound, but once the currency rebounds, the sky is the limit for Ryan Air.#3. Alaska Air (NYSE: ALK[3])Alaska 
Airlines made headlines when it announced it was buying Virgin Air[4]. Many investors were skeptical about the 
purchase, but long term, it makes sense. First, it helps Alaska Air diversify from their main hub in Seattle. And 
second, with the airline able to squeeze as much profit as it can, currently over 20%, it will do the same for the 
Are Airline Stocks Ready To Take Off?
Virgin brand as well. As it stands now, Virgin's profitability is just over 11%. Higher profitability means a higher stock 
price and more hubs allows the airline to avoid having to drastically cut airline ticket prices to compete with other 
airlines. In addition to the merged synergies, by the end of 2017, the airline will have replaced its remaining 
outdated 737's with new larger, and more fuel efficient models. The carrier will end up with nearly 25% more 
seating capacity. This will only increase revenues more as Alaska Air has been able to increase capacity in recent 
years. The stock price for Alaska Air has been on a steady rise but with its recent stall, now is a great time to get in 
on this company before the stock price shoots higher.Final ThoughtsAs mentioned at the beginning of this post, 
airline stocks are volatile by nature. But as with anything you invest in, you can weed away some risk by investing 
smartly. By investing in strong, healthy airlines, you can take some of this volatility out of the picture. Of course, 
there is still the chance of the unexpected happening, but these stocks will be able to rebound from any unforeseen 
issues they may face. This author has no positions in any stock mentioned and does not plan to open any positions 
in any stocks mentioned for at least 72 hours after publication of this article. Photo Source[5] The post Are Airline

Alitalia 's Board Approves Its Unimaginative and Undoubtedly Unsuccessful Restructuring Plan
Alitalia's Board Approves Its Unimaginative and Undoubtedly Unsuccessful 
Restructuring Plan
The Cranky Flier

Length: 764 words
Byline: CF
Body
Mar 20, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Since January, Alitalia, the 
worst airline ever, has been hard at work on restructuring plan #1,403 so it can save itself from doom. This took 
longer than expected, but the plan has now been approved by the Board of Directors[1]. It does indeed sound a lot 
like the plan I wrote about in January[2]. Chance of success? Not good. 
In short, Alitalia will slash costs and then magically increase revenue by 30 percent. Seems totally likely, right? Just 
reading through the press release brings up so many obvious problems. Let's walk through three big ones. Gigantic 
Problem #1 - Unions Won't Like ThisIn the second paragraph of the release, it becomes very clear what the first 
major issue will be. The plan's funding by the company's shareholders is subject to Alitalia's trade unions agreeing 
to a new collective works agreement and headcount-related measures. Hahahahahaha. Right, so Alitalia is now 
going to take the plan to the government. After that, it'll go to the unions and try to come to an agreement. Alitalia's 
unions already agreed to some changes back when Etihad first bought in to the airline. That plan was touted as 
saving Alitalia, but obviously it didn't work since now the airline needs another plan. If you think the unions will just 
gladly step aside, I've got a bridge to sell you. Gigantic Problem #2 - Alitalia Can't Compete with Low Cost 
CarriersThe release points out that low cost carriers fly 47 percent of air traffic in the Italian market. To combat this, 
Alitalia is going to try to turn its short haul operation into a low cost carrier. Look for buy-on-board food, more seats 
on aircraft, higher aircraft utilization, more ancillaries for sale, and 'more attractive airfares.' Oh, and it's going to cut 
its Airbus narrowbody fleet from 78 down to 58. Some of this is obvious and should have been done long ago, but 
no matter what Alitalia does, there's no way it's going to be cost-competitive with a Ryanair or Wizz Air. It can try to 
drive out cost, but it won't win. And by cutting the product down to match the low cost carriers, it's hurting its ability 
to try to generate a revenue premium (if there's one to be had at all). The release says this is 'a concerted drive 
towards increasing revenue while stripping out existing costs,' but really it looks like an attempt to strip out costs 
without much of a revenue plan at all. Gigantic Problem #3 - This is a Terrible Time for Long Haul GrowthWe've 
been talking here regularly about how the Transatlantic market is brutal right now. Low cost carriers are using new 
low cost airplanes to flood the market with capacity. The legacies aren't stepping back, using their own new lower-
cost brands as well. So it's disconcerting, to say the least, that Alitalia's plan for profit is to grow in this market. The 
airline will re-evaluate its transatlantic options to try and fly more often on existing routes and to add new cities in 
the Americas. Forget about the fact that for Alitalia to really ramp up its Transatlantic flying, there's a good chance 
the joint venture with Delta/KLM/Air France will die. That's a problem in its own right. There's also the issue of 
hugely seasonal demand between Italy and the Americas. Europe to the Americas is always seasonal, but Italy is 
Alitalia 's Board Approves Its Unimaginative and Undoubtedly Unsuccessful Restructuring Plan
even more so since it has such a strong reliance on tourism. All of these factors add up to mean bad news for 
Alitalia's prospects. â€”With 20 fewer short haul airplanes, even increased utilization is going to result in fewer flights 
than today. For Alitalia to reach its goal of increasing revenue by 30 percent, it must be thinking about a ton of long 
haul capacity. It's hard to imagine how this will be profitable long haul capacity, but it could get Alitalia to its goal of 
increasing revenues. That goal is, of course, useless if it's not profitable. The reality is that Alitalia is stuck. Low cost 
carriers are killing it on short haul flights. And on long haul flights, there's too much capacity anyway, especially 
from Europe to the Americas. There's no viable out for Alitalia, but instead of admitting that, it just keeps 
rearranging the deck chairs. The good news for Alitalia is that it'll just keep chugging along. There's too much 
national pride in Italy to let this airline die. And that is naturally good news for me and the blog. [ 1]:

Almost all flights from Berlin's two airports are to be canceled due to a further strike by ground crews. The union is 
calling for a pay increase and better working hours in the face of an increased workload.The strike is to last from 4 
a.m. local time (0300 GMT) on Monday to 5 a.m. local time Tuesday, according to the Verdi union which represents 
2,000 members of ground staff at Berlin's two major airports: Tegel in the north and SchÃ¶nefeld in the south.A 
spokesman for Berlin airports said that almost all flights would be cancelled on Monday: 194 at SchÃ¶nefeld and 448 
in Tegel. 
As well as Lufthansa, carriers including Air Berlin, easyJet and Ryanair.The union is demanding a 1 euro ($1.07) 
increase for the hourly wages for the ground staff as a part of a one-year collective agreement. Berlin airport 
management previously offered a 10 cent increase of hourly wages over four years, which then changed to an 8 
percent increase over three years. The union is also calling for better working conditions."The volume is too small 
and the duration far too long to find a compromise on this basis," said Verdi negotiator Enrico Ruemker in a 
statement.Monday's strike is a continuation from last Friday, when ground crews held a strike that led to nearly 700 
cancelled flights, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. Ground crews include personnel checking in 
passengers, loading and unloading planes and directing airplanes on the tarmac.The two airports service many 
airliners, including those of Lufthansa, Air Berlin and Ryanair. Lufthansa stated it would cancel all flights from Berlin 
to Frankfurt and Munich and vice versa. kbd/jm (AFP, Reuters)

Mar 07, 2017( TheNextWeb.com: http://thenextweb.com Delivered by Newstex)  The economics of MVNOs[1] are 
pretty simple. A virtual provider will piggyback off a 'real' provider's infrastructure, offering cut-price network access. 
There are usually some caveats (data speeds, for example, are often slower) but it's generally a good deal. 
FreedomPop[2] has tread a different path. It offers a basic mobile package for free. In the US, for example, it offers 
500 texts, 200 minutes, and 500MB of mobile data, completely gratis. The LA-based company also offers similarly 
generous packages in several European markets, including Spain, the UK, and Mexico.Should your limited 
allowances run out, you are given the opportunity to pay to upgrade them. It's for this reason why one-time TNW 
reporter Mic Wright described the service as 'the Ryanair of mobile networks[3],' although I think a comparison to 
Farmville would be more apt, as airlines don't typically operate on a freemium model. Perhaps as a sign of things to 
come, FreedomPop has announced its first ever own-brand smartphone. The FreedomPop V7 costs just Â£59 
(roughly $72), and is launching today in the U.K. and Spain. Specs wise, it doesn't overwhelm, although you 
wouldn't expect it to for its price. It boasts:5-inch IPS screen 13MP rear-facing camera 16GB of storage 1.1Ghz 
quad-core Snapdragon 210 Dual SIM slotsFreedomPop's previous flirtations with the hardware side of the mobile 
business include selling refurbished and pre-owned Android[4] and iOS[5] devices. But by launching its own 
branded device, the company signals that it intends to change course. It also intends to ship the FreedomPop V7 
with one of its own SIM cards. This effectively means that if you're a light user, you can spend Â£59 for a cell phone, 
and get the service for free indefinitely. Furthermore, the FreedomPop V7 ships unlocked, allowing you to use SIM 
cards from any other network. Although, as Paul Sawers from VentureBeat points out[6], it's a good idea to leave 
the FreedomPop SIM card in place if you're an enthusiastic Whatsapp[7] user, as the company has zero-rated the 
popular chat service in Spain and the US. This means that if you're in those countries, you won't have to pay to use 
it.  Free-to-use mobile network FreedomPop launches own-brand Android smartphone on Venturebeat

Trump, Big Government, the Export-Import Bank, and the Washington Swamp
Trump, Big Government, the Export-Import Bank, and the Washington 
Swamp

Feb 17, 2017( International Liberty: http://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  I've written many 
times that Washington is both a corrupt city and a corrupting city. My point is that decent people go into government 
and all too often wind up losing their ethical values[1] as they learn to 'play the game.' 
https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2011/09/17/washingtons-revolving-door-of-legal-corruption/I often joke that 
these are people who start out thinking Washington is a cesspool but eventually decide it's a hot tub. During the 
presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted to 'drain the swamp[2],' which is similar to my cesspool example. My 
concern is that El Presidente may not understand (or perhaps not even care[3]) that shrinking the size and scope of 
government is the only effective way[4] to reduce Washington corruption. In any event, we're soon going to get a 
very strong sign about whether Trump was serious. With Republicans on Capitol Hill divided on how to deal with 
this cronyist institution, Trump basically has the tie-breaking vote on the issue. In other words, he has the power to 
shut down this geyser of corporate welfare[5]. But will he? According the Susan Ferrechio of the Washington 
Examiner, Trump may choose to wallow in the swamp[6] rather than drain it. President Trump now may be in favor 
of the Export-Import Bank, according to Republican lawmakers who met with him privately Thursday, even though 
Trump once condemned the bank as corporate welfare. Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center is one on the 
Ex-Im Bank's most tenacious opponents, and she's very worried[7]. if the reports are true that Trump has decided to 
support the restoration of the crony Export-Import Bank's full lending authority, it would be akin to the president 
deciding to instead happily bathe in the swamp and gargle the muck.            http://freedomandprosperity.org/wp-
content/uploads/2017/02/Veronique-Ex-Im-Trump-Title.jpgIf true, the news is only 'great' for Boeing, GE, and the 
other major recipients of Ex-Im's corporate welfare. It is also at odds with his campaign promises since much of the 
way the program works is that it gives cheap loans â€” backed by Americans all over the country â€” to foreign 
companies in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Restoring Ex-Im's full lending-authority powers is 
renewing the policy to give cheap loans backed by workers in the Rust Belt to companies like Ryanair ($4 billion in 
guarantee loans over ten years) and Emirates Airlines ($3.9 billion over ten years) so they can have a large 
competitive advantage over U.S. domestic airlines like Delta and United. It continued to subsidize the large and 
prosperous state-owned Mexican oil company PEMEX ($9.7 billion over ten years). Seriously? That's president 
Trump's vision of draining the swamp? Ugh. It will be very disappointing if Trump chooses corporate welfare over 
taxpayers. What presumably matters most, though, is whether a bad decision on the Ex-Im Bank is a deviation or a 
harbinger of four years of cronyism. In other words, when the dust settles, will the net effect of Trump's policies be a 
bigger swamp or smaller swamp? The New York Times opined[8] that Trump is basically replacing one set of 
Trump, Big Government, the Export-Import Bank, and the Washington Swamp
insiders with another set of insiders, which implies a bigger swamp. Mr. Trump may be out to challenge one 
establishment â€” the liberal elite â€” but he is installing one of his own, filled with tycoons, Wall Street heavyweights, 
cronies and a new rank of shadowy wealthy 'advisers' unaccountable to anyone but him. Take first the Goldman 
Sachs crowd. The Trump campaign lambasted global financiers, led by Goldman, as having 'robbed our working 
class,' but here come two of the alleged miscreants: Gary Cohn, Goldman's president, named to lead the National 
Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, named as Treasury secretary. Standing in the rain during Mr. Trump's 
inaugural speech, farmers and factory workers, truckers, nurses and housekeepers greeted his anti-establishment 
words by cheering 'Drain the Swamp!' even as the new president was standing knee-deep in a swamp of his own. 
I'm skeptical of Trump, and I'm waiting to see whether Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin will be friends for taxpayers, 
so 
I'm 
far 
from 
a 
cheerleader 
for 
the 
current 
administration. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2016/11/11/tesla-spacex-solarcity-and-the-cancer-of-cronyism-plus-some-
post-election-humor/But I also think the New York Times is jumping the gun. Maybe Trump will be a swamp-
wallowing cronyist[9], but we don't yet have enough evidence (though a bad decision on Ex-Im[10] certainly would 
be a very bad omen). Here's another potential indicator of what may happen to the swamp under Trump's reign. 
Bloomberg reports[11] that two former Trump campaign officials, Corey Lewandowski and Barry Bennett have 
cashed in by setting up a lobbying firm to take advantage of their connections. The arrival of a new president 
typically means a gold rush for Washington lobbyists as companies, foreign governments, and interest groups 
scramble for access and influence in the administration. Trump's arrival promises to be differentâ€”at least according 
to Trump. Throughout the campaign, he lambasted the capital as a den of insider corruption and repeatedly vowed 
to 'drain the swamp,' a phrase second only in the Trump lexicon to 'make America great again.' Trump's well-
advertised disdain for lobbying might seem to augur poorly for a firm seeking to peddle influence. 'Business,' 
Lewandowski says, 'has been very, very good.' This rubs me the wrong way. I don't want lobbyists to get rich. But, 
to be fair, not all lobbying is bad. Many industries hire 'representation' because they want to protect themselves 
from taxes and regulation. And they have a constitutional right to 'petition' the government and contribute 
money[12], so I definitely don't want to criminalize lobbying. But as I've said over and over again[13], I'd like a much 
smaller government so that interest groups don't have an incentive to do either the right kind of lobbying (self-
protection) or the wrong kind of lobbying (seeking to obtain unearned wealth via the coercive power of government). 
Here's one final story about the oleaginous nature of Washington. Wells Fargo is giving a big payout[14] to Elaine 
Chao, the new Secretary of Transportation. Chao, who joined Wells Fargo as a board member in 2011, has 
collected deferred stock options â€” a compensation perk generally designed as a long-term retention strategy â€” 
that she would not be able to cash out if she left the firm to work for a competitor. Her financial disclosure notes that 
she will receive a 'cash payout for my deferred stock compensation' upon confirmation as Secretary of 
Transportation. The document discloses that the payments will continue throughout her time in government, if she 
is confirmed. The payouts will begin in July 2017 and continue yearly through 2021. But Wells Fargo, like several 
banks and defense contractors, provides a special clause in its standard executive employment contract that 
offers flexibility for awarding compensation if executives leave the bank to enter 'government service.' Such 
clauses, critics say, are structured to incentivize the so-called 'reverse revolving door' of private sector officials 
burrowing into government. Golden parachutes for executives leaving firms to enter government dogged several 
Obama administration officials. Jack Lew, upon leaving Citigroup to join the Obama administration in 2009, was 
given a cash payout as part of his incentive and retention awards that wouldn't have been paid if he had left the firm 
to join a competitor or under ordinary circumstances. But Lew's Citigroup contract stipulated that there was an 
exception for leaving to work in a 'full time high level position with the U.S. government or regulatory body.' 
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Northrop Grumman are among the other firms that have offered special 
financial rewards to executives who leave to enter government. This rubs me the wrong way, just as it rubbed me 
the wrong way when one of Obama's cabinet appointees got a similar payout[15]. But the more I think about it, the 
real question isn't whether government officials get to keep stock options and other forms of deferred compensation 
when they jump to government. What bothers me much more is why companies feel that it's in their interest to hire 
people closely connected to government. What value[16] did Jacob Lew bring to Citigroup? What value did Chao 
bring to Wells Fargo?            https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/washingtons-culture-of-corruption/I 
suspect that the answer has a lot to do with financial institutions wanting people[17] who can can pick up the phone 
and extract favors and information from senior officials in government. For what it's worth, I'm not a fan of Lew 
because he pushed for statism while at Treasury. By contrast, I am a fan of Chao because she was one of the few 
bright spots during the generally statist Bush years[18]. But I don't want a system[19] where private companies feel 
Trump, Big Government, the Export-Import Bank, and the Washington Swamp
like they should hire either one of them simply because they have connections in Washington. I hope that Trump 
will change this perverse set of incentives by 'draining the swamp.' But unless he reduces the size and scope of 
government[20], 
the 
problem 
will 
get 
worse 
rather 
than 
better.

Feb 14, 2017( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  As Boeing prepares to 
deliver its first 737 MAX airplane and to boost production of single-aisle jets 12 percent â€” both by May â€” the 
Renton factory has geared up with addtional refinements of its already humming manufacturing methods. Boeing 
showed off the latest innovations inside its Renton factory on a tour of the 737 wing facility Monday, showcasing 
impressive new robotic machines as well as more efficient ways of deploying its mechanics. While it introduces the 
new 737 MAX, the company is also ramping up its 737 production rate to 47 per month, from 43.Vice president and 
general manager Keith Leverkuhnbrimmed with good news about the program schedule and the new jet's 
performance. Leverkuhn said the MAX flight test program has just one test to complete and should get certification 
from the Federal Aviation Adminstration (FAA) within 'days or weeks.' 
Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]He said the fourth flight test airplane last month 
completed a 100-flight-hour tour of the Pacific Rim â€” including a cold soak test in Yakutsk, Russia, and a stop in 
hot and humid Darwin, Australia â€” that produced just a single 'squawk,' the term used to denote the airplane 
performing even slightly off expectations. Having already built 13 of the initial MAX 8 models, all now sitting around 
Renton airfield awaiting FAA certification, Boeing showed off the first of the large MAX 9 models sitting on the 
assembly line and almost ready to roll out. Its advanced winglets, sweeping up and down from the wingtip, set it 
apart from the current model 737s on the adjacent line, with their traditional upward-swept winglets.Also very 
different were the MAX's new LEAP engines. With a fan diameter of more than 69 inches, the LEAP seemed to 
dwarf the older CFM-56 engine, with its 61-inch fan, on a nearby current model 737-900ER. The MAX 9 will begin 
flight tests in April, Leverkuhn said.Soon after, the smaller MAX 7 will come along, and then the high-density version 
that budget airline Ryanair covets, the MAX200, seating 199 passengers.And Leverkuhn said Boeing is actively 
seeking input from airlines on whether it should add one more even larger model, the MAX 10, to the family.New 
wing spar automationTo make all this possible, dramatic changes are well underway inside the Renton factory. New 
automated machines are revolutionizing assembly of the wing spars â€” the long beams along the leading and 
trailing edges of each wing.And on the other side of the building, crews of engineers and mechanics who finish the 
wings by installing all the wiring, plumbing and control systems have figured out how to accomodate the coming 
rate increases â€” up to 52 jets per month next year, then 57 jets per month in 2019 â€” without adding another line to 
their area. In a plant that has steadily morphed into the most productive airplane factory in the world[2], Barry Lewis, 
director of 737 Wing Operations, declared on Monday that 'the transformation is almost complete.'On one side of 
the wing building, Boeing currently has 10 large machines that it introduced in 1997 when it developed the current 
model of the 737. Known as Automated Spar Assembly Tools, or ASAT machines, these drill and fasten the heavy 
Boeing ramps up automation, innovation as it readies 737MAX
spars that are the structural spines along the edges of the wings. To increase 737 output by 36 percent over the 
next three years, Boeing at first thought to buy some more ASAT machines, which were designed and supplied in 
the late 1990s by Mukilteo-based engineering firm Electroimpact. But Boeing realized it doesn't have room. The 
ASAT machines are huge, with a tall, wide gantry straddling the xxTKxx-foot-long spar. So all 10 of these machines 
will be phased out by year end, replaced by just two fully automated Spar Assembly Line (SAL) cells - newly 
designed by Electroimpact and already in place. Each cell contains two Electroimpact drilling and fastening 
machines, much smaller than the ASAT machines, that zip along a single spar simultaneously, drilling and filling as 
they go.Critically, alongside the business end of each machine is a robotic arm that swings in and changes the drill 
head and the fastener whenever a different type of hole is to be drilled. On the old ASAT machines, changing the 
tools is done manually, adding a great deal of down time. In the new SAL cells, that's all automated. At one end of 
the SAL cell, two operators sat before a control console Monday intently watching eight big screens, including four 
video screens monitoring every move of the machines. 'In future, whether we need two operators (or just one) per 
cell is to be determined,' Lewis said.Improving human efficiencyThe new SAL cells, occupying 80 percent less floor 
space than the ASAT machines they replace, are just the latest push in Renton's drive toward automation. In recent 
years, Boeing has transformed the way it installs systems in the 737 fuselages by shifting to a moving line. It also 
has automated the way it assembles the skin panels for the wings using huge Electroimpact machines.[3]Earlier, 
final assembly of the wings was made more efficient and more automated with a move from putting them together 
while hanging vertically in fixed tools to a more ergonomic and faster horizontal build line, in which the wings are 
assembled lying flat[4]. And yet Lewis deflected concerns about robots replacing humans, pointing out that Boeing 
will be hiring modestly in Renton over the next few years, not losing workers. 'We're going up in rate,' he said. 'More 
planes means more jobs.' In another sector of the wing building, where the wings are completed with all the wiring 
and ducting added, on Monday the second set of MAX 9 wings . There, Lewis praised his team of engineers and 
mechanics for figuring out how Boeing can increase throughput as high as 57 pairs of wings per month without 
adding any new machinery. 'It's people thinking of better ways to do it,' said Lewis.The workers divided up the work 
into smaller packages, which could be accomplished with more people working on the wing simultaneously yet with 
their moves choreographed so as not to get in each other's way. Darwin Stachowiak, a team lead on the wing 
installation, said that by having front line employees think through the most efficient way to get the work done, 
'we've really streamlined the way we build these wings.' The 737 will be 50 years old in April. Yet if all the 
production increases in Renton go to plan, and Boeing decides to go forward with the MAX 10, Boeing will within a 
few years be making more 737s than ever before, and airlines will be flying five new variants of the jet. Right now, 
everything 
is 
on 
track 
to 
accomplish 
just 
that.

HNA Group has been in final talks to buy Frankfurt-Hahn Airport in Germany. HNA Group has joined hands with 
German company ADC for the airport. It is Frankfurt-Hahn Airport owner's second attempt to sell the loss-making 
airport. In 2016, Frankfurt-Hahn Airport owner intended to sell it to a Chinese investor but the bidder failed to make 
payments after agreeing to a purchase price of 13 million euros. Hahn Airport is a small airport, and it reported a 
loss of 17 million euros in 2015. The airport is used mainly by low-cost carriers, including Ireland's Ryanair. In 2015, 
the airport handled 2.6 million passengers, well below 4 million a decade ago. The proposed HNA airport deal is the 
latest in a series of overseas acquisitions by HNA Group.

View original post here[2].Despite solid investor appetite for riskier, corporate bonds, it appears that political 
uncertainty across Europe is startng to create problems for the region's so-called 'safest' borrowers. As Bloomberg 
reports,[3] France's government-linked development agency postponed a $1 billion bond sale this week, citing 
market volatility, while a junk-rated shipping company managed to increase the size of its sale. In a week 
dominated by bond sales from sovereign and financial issuers, corporate borrowers accounted for three of the four 
most subscribed deals. Molnlycke Holding AB tops the list, as the surgical product maker's first debt sale since 
2015 pulled in bids nearly 5.4 times the 500 million-euro ($532 million) issue. Investors also clamored to buy 
Ryanair Holdings Plc's first bonds since 2015, which it sold two days after reporting earnings. 
http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2017/02/10/20170210_EU1.jpg But while 
junkier issuers are in great demand, the safest borrowers are in trouble Agence Francaise de Developpement 
received insufficient orders because of investor concern that the notes would suffer in line with French government 
bonds amid the country's fragmented presidential election, according to head of treasury Bokar Cherif. AFD, which 
holds the third-highest investment-grade rating and provides funding for sustainable projects in developing 
countries, may wait until after elections in April and May to resume the sale, Cherif said in a phone interview. It's 
rated AA at S...lobal Ratings and Fitch Ratings. 'The performance of our notes is completely pegged to the French 
sovereign,' Cherif said. 'Investors are trying to get a grasp of the political situation in France. The only thing we can 
really do is acknowledge that there are worries and take them into account in our plans.'Some top-rated borrowers 
are vulnerable to price swings in sovereign debt because their fortunes are so closely linked to underlying rates. 
The threat of an anti-establishment president in France, along with elections from Germany to the Netherlands, 
potential deadlock in Italy and Britain's negotiations to exit the European Union may damp investor demand for the 
highest-rated notes at the same time as the European Central Bank prepares to curtail its purchases. 'There's a lot 
of known political risk in Europe this year,' said Roger Webb, a London-based investment director at Aberdeen 
Asset Management Plc, which manages about 303 billion pounds ($381 billion). 'We shouldn't be surprised if there 
are periods during the year when deals get pulled because the underlying government bond market is particularly 
volatile.'The core of Europe is starting to diverge as policy uncertainty soars and 'whatever it takes' fades            
http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2017/02/10/20170210_EU.jpg 'It's quite 
surprising that a borrower that's that high quality would feel the need to pull back,' said Gordon Shannon, a money 
manager at TwentyFour Asset Management in London, referring to AFD. 'It's a big signal to the stress that's starting 
to build here.' [ 1]:            http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/sY4yTD8nRXk/amid-political-turmoil-

Feb 06, 2017( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Average fares dropped 17 
per cent, and profits slid 8 per cent to 95m euros, Â£82m, as the fall in the pound also hit its results, the BBC[1] 
reports. However, passenger numbers in the quarter rose 16 per cent to 29 million, and its planes flew at 95 per 
cent capacity. Ryanair said it was 'cautious'[2] about the rest of the financial year, but profits would still meet 
expectations. 
Ryanair's average fares were 33 euros, Â£28, per passenger in the October-to-December period, the third quarter of 
its financial year. It said it was increasing capacity and adding new routes and bases at a time when other airlines 
were also adding capacity, and 'accordingly the price environment remains weak'. Ryanair added that uncertainty 
following the Brexit vote, weaker sterling and the switch of charter capacity from Turkey, Egypt and North Africa into 
Spain and Portugal, would 'continue to put downward pressure on pricing for the remainder of this year' and next. It 
expects yields, or average fare per passenger per mile, in the fourth quarter to be down by 15 per cent. However, it 
said it was 'maintaining its full-year profit guidance in the range of 1.30bn to 1.35bn euros'. In the next financial year 
it said it seemed clear that 'pricing will continue to be challenging and we will respond to these adverse market 
conditions with strong traffic growth and lower unit costs'. 'There's a huge amount of capacity which has migrated 
out of North Africa into the likes of Portugal and Spain,' Ryanair chief financial officer Neil Sorahan told the BBC. 
'That said, Ryanair is very focused on our costs and you would have seen in the quarter our unit costs, excluding 
fuel, were down 6 per cent at a time when our competitors are actually seeing their costs rise. 'It's the reason we're 
making the kind of profits that we made and why we're retaining our [profit] guidance.''Great opportunities'Asked 
about the carrier's plans post-Brexit, Mr Sorahan said that while the airline expected to expand in the UK, 'we have 
been quite clear that as we move closer to Brexit that we won't grow as quickly in the UK as we might otherwise 
have done'. 'We have 15 per cent market share now all across Europe so there's an awful lot more to play for and 
we're seeing a lot of great opportunities outside of the UK,' he added. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX 
Capital, said: 'Ryanair's trouble is that it has huge exposure to the UK market and sterling, but earnings are booked 
in euros. 'The airline derives about a quarter of its earnings in pounds so the collapse in sterling explains a good 
deal of the fall in profits,' he added. 'The company's response to the drop in the pound - to aggressively lower fares 
to grab market share while expanding routes - doesn't help profits in the near term. 'But going forward the growth in 
traffic 
will 
help 
put 
it 
on 
a 
surer 
footing, 
particularly 
as 
it's 
also 
reducing 
costs.'

Feb 06, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-frills carrier 
Ryanair has announced its third-quarter profit has dropped considerably, with a weak British pound being one of the 
main reasons behind the slump. 
Full-year guidance was left unchanged.Earnings at Europe's largest carrier by passenger numbers dropped by 8 
percent year on year in the third quarter to December 31, the Irish airline reported Monday.Ryanair said net 
earnings fell to 95 million euros ($102 million) for the three months to the end of last year, owing to a sharp decline 
in the value of the pound after Britain's decision to leave the European Union."With less than two months of the 
financial year to go, and no Easter in March, we expect fourth-quarter yields to decline by as much as 15 percent," 
the company said in a statement.Cheap tickets"Pricing will continue to be challenging; and we will respond to 
adverse market conditions with strong traffic growth and lower unit costs, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary 
said.Ryanair noted that customers would continue to see cheap fares, which were "falling faster than we initially 
planned."In October of last year, Ryanair cut its forecast for profit after tax by 5 percent for the full year to March 31, 
to a range of 1.3 billion to 1.35 billion euros. The carrier said Monday it was maintaining that guidance.hg/jd (AFP,

Feb 06, 2017( BusinessPundit: http://www.businesspundit.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We've been taking a close 
look at recruiting software systems this week and our overall pick for the best recruiting software systems for small 
businesses is Workable. Workable is a fully-featured recruitment software which is affordable and works on a 
sensible pricing model which doesn't limit those features (unlike many other recruitment software providers which 
do).Why 
Did 
We 
Choose 
Workable?We 
chose 
Workable 
for 
a 
variety 
of 
factors 
and 
these 
include:ReputationWorkable was founded in 2012 and while that's not quite the length of time in business that we 
prefer; it's not terrible given that software companies do tend to spring up over night. 
We do like the fact that they already have more than 5,000 customers and they're based in more than 80 countries 
worldwide; that suggests a diverse revenue base which won't be threatened by economic changes in a single 
marketplace. Their customers include Travelex, Ryanair and Marks and Spencer which suggests that Workable 
won't be a fly-by-night flash-in-the-pan and will stay the course. We also like the fact that you can try Workable for 
15 days for free; which means you can get a genuine feel for the software before having to stump up the cash for 
it.Value for Money Workable's pricing scheme is fundamentally fair. Unlike many recruitment software solutions 
which charge a fixed monthly fee or limit the number of features that you get access to if you're not paying a 
significant premium for their top tier service - Workable charges based on the number of active vacancies that you 
have running. This starts at $19/month for a single job listing and scales from there. Whatever number of vacancies 
you use Workable for; while you're paying for their service - the fee includes full phone and e-mail support and an 
unlimited number of user licenses. That's incredibly good value and it's one of the things that we really liked about 
Workable when compared to its competitors. You can also access many of the big jobsites via Workable and 
Workable can provide a discount on their services in many cases and that can really keep your recruitment costs 
down. In fact, it's possible to save so much money with Workable's discounts that the service becomes effectively 
free to use.Ease of Use and FunctionalityValue for money and reputation are all well and good but it's very 
important that whatever software system you buy in to today - that it's easy to use. There's no point in keeping costs 
down on software if you spend three times as much on operating that software. We're pleased to report that 
Workable is very easy to use and it's packed to the brim with features including:Creating a Career Website 
Workable lets you create a career website for your company and it's simple to do this by following onscreen 
instructions. It's worth noting that Workable isn't open source software and that means there are limits on the 
amount of customization you can get away with but the 'out of the box' options are high-quality and your career 
website will look great.Automatic Updates to Jobsites and Social MediaWorkable's biggest advantage over its free 
Workable Review: The Best Recruiting Software System for Small Businesses
competitor Osclass is that it supports all the major job boards and it's easy to update all of these boards at once 
without having to duplicate any efforts. You can also automatically post to your social media and there's a nice 
feature with Workable which adds a new tab to your company's Facebook page for recruitment purposes.Creating a 
Job ListingCreating a job listing is very easy and you can customize the post as much as you'd like. It's very easy to 
create a very specific listing without endless amounts of typing and we liked that. You're also free to create a 
specific application form to use for each job that you create in Workable and it's a question of dragging and 
dropping elements to configure them - this is a big advantage of using Workable over a free service like 
Osclass.Creating ResourcesYou can add external recruiters and internal recruiters to a specific vacancy making it 
very easy for people to incorporate Workable's functionality in their existing workflow.Job ApplicantsApplying for a 
job is hassle free through the Workable interface and it's also easy for a candidate to import much of the information 
they need straight from their LinkedIn profile; saving them a lot of time on filling the application form.Talent 
ManagementWorkable's talent management system is light years ahead of Osclass's and it's an area that really 
shines for HR teams. You can track candidate data plus gauge the effectiveness of specific recruitment campaigns 
and resources from a simple interface.Customer Support Customer support is an essential for many businesses 
and in this respect Workable is very much a market leader. All of their plans come with unlimited telephone and e-
mail support which is of a very high standard indeed. We found their representatives to be both friendly and 
extremely knowledgeable. They weren't afraid to refer us to their online help sections when they felt that a written 
guide would be more valuable to us than a walkthrough. They were also pleased to point us to other useful 
resources regarding recruitment and hiring that lay outside of Workable's responsibilities and domain as a software 
provider. That's definitely going above and beyond.Drawbacks of Using WorkableWorkable is our best overall 
recruitment software system for small businesses but that doesn't mean that there aren't some minor issues with 
the system either. Firstly, there's a lack of 24/7 support and in fact, their e-mail response times are on a 3 hour 
turnaround which isn't exactly speedy. Then there's the lack of a mobile application. We think that this is becoming 
a standard requirement of software systems and we'd like to see Workable get this sorted in the near future. Finally, 
Workable is still a little feature-light compared to the most expensive recruitment software tools but we felt that 
these omissions were reasonable in light of the value for money price tag offered by Workable.How to Pick the

Lufthansa and Etihad Inch Toward Closer Ties
Lufthansa and Etihad Inch Toward Closer Ties

Feb 02, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  In a TV-worthy press 
conference of a scale not seen since well, since Trump's reality show Supreme Court nominee reveal the evening 
before, Etihad and Lufthansa announced that they're increasing cooperation[1]. That increase, however, is a whole 
lot less than what had been rumored. For now.For years, Etihad and Lufthansa have been enemies. Lufthansa was 
one of the airlines leading the charge in Europe to keep the Middle East carriers out, similar to the later efforts that 
American, Delta, and United started in the US. 
At some point, however, Lufthansa followed the American Airlines plan: keep complaining but take full advantage of 
any commercial opportunities at the same time. The first real thawing came recently through a third party, Air Berlin. 
Air Berlin had performed poorly for years when Etihad decided to dive right in with an equity investment. Things 
only got worse and Air Berlin begged Uncle Etihad for money time and time again. In this last go-around, Etihad 
had effectively run out of options, so it split the airline up. Air Berlin's leisure business spun out into a joint venture 
with TUI. The business-focused hub-and-spoke operation stayed as Air Berlin, and then a bunch of a excess A320s 
were leased out to Lufthansa Group to fly under the flag of Eurowings (33 airplanes) and Austrian (5 airplanes). 
Why would Lufthansa do that? Well, it could either keep that capacity flying or it could let Air Berlin die. The latter 
sounds appealing, until you think it through. That would create a vacuum that would be filled by far stronger airlines. 
(Yes, Ryanair, I'm looking at you.) This was a blocking move, and not one that's going to result in long term 
success. But the discussion with Etihad over the Air Berlin deal apparently opened the door to greater collaboration. 
In the Air Berlin deal itself, the airlines opened up an oddly-specific minor codesharing agreement that has the 
Lufthansa code going on flights between Abu Dhabi and both Frankfurt and Munich. The Etihad code will go on 
Lufthansa's flights from Frankfurt to both Bogota and Rio (pending government approval). Now they're going to get 
even closer.  You can get more coverage of the splashy press conference from Live and Let's Fly[2], but much of 
that is fluff. Here's what's been announced in a nutshell. LSG Sky Chefs (Lufthansa-owned caterer) will provide 
catering to Etihad in 16 cities in Europe, Asia, and American.Etihad and Lufthansa Technik have a memorandum of 
understanding that they're going to work more closely together, whatever that means.Etihad will move into Terminal 
1 in Frankfurt and Terminal 2 in Munich to be co-located with Lufthansa.'Etihad Airways and Lufthansa are also 
exploring further cooperation in a number of areas, including freight operations, procurement and passenger 
services to improve their competitive offering globally and in the European market.'Right, so not much has actually 
been announced. But as outgoing Etihad CEO James Hogan said in the press release: This partnership is the 
platform for a much wider strategic collaboration between our two organisations. It demonstrates the commitment of 
the Etihad Aviation Group Board and Abu Dhabi to our European growth strategy. So I guess we can think of this as 
Lufthansa and Etihad Inch Toward Closer Ties
a pre-announcement. There is more to come. Even though there isn't much substance this time around, it's still 
important. For Lufthansa, this is certainly an about-face but it shouldn't be surprising. As the Middle East carriers 
continue to grow, it's going to be harder and harder to ignore the traffic they can feed into Europe. Might as well 
have it feed Lufthansa instead of a competitor. Etihad and Air France/KLM had been dancing around deeper 
cooperation as well, so this not only helps Lufthansa but probably undermines a direct competitor. With Qatar and 
IAG (British Airways, Iberia, etc) thick as thieves, this leaves Air France/KLM with Emirates as likely its only option. 
For Etihad, this is a big change in partner strategy. Previously, Etihad's primary focus has been on acquiring stakes 
in failing airlines and trying to use them to pump traffic into the Etihad network no matter the cost. That was an 
incredibly expensive strategy, but that didn't used to matter. With demand weakening and growth softening, Abu 
Dhabi is doing its light version of belt-tightening. Instead, Etihad can focus its efforts on tying up with a major, 
successful global airline to feed traffic. This strategy makes more sense commercially. I imagine Etihad had to wait 
for management at one of these global airlines to be receptive to further partering (since the only one previously 
interested, IAG, was snapped up quickly). Lufthansa is finally getting there. It's hard to know where this is going to 
end up. Rumors had flown around everything from Etihad joining Star Alliance to a full-blown merger with 
Lufthansa. Those rumors were premature but not necessarily false. (Ok, a lot would have to change for Etihad to 
enter Star Alliance, and a full blown merger is pretty unlikely, but there's a whole lot in between that would make 
sense.)  This is the proverbial tip of the iceberg in what could be a tipping point for massive changes in how Middle 
East carriers are viewed by other airlines. Or it could be more of the same old stuff - benefit from the Middle East 
carriers 
while 
continuing 
to 
denounce 
them.

Feb 01, 2017( Slugger O'Toole: http://www.sluggerotoole.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Yesterday's announcement 
that Brussels Airlines are withdrawing their route from Belfast City Airport to Brussels is the latest in a series of 
setbacks for Northern Ireland's aviation sector, following the controversy surrounding the termination of United 
Airlines' route from Belfast International to Newark.The habit of throwing government funds at airlines to coax them 
into flying to Northern Ireland, only for them to pack their bags and leave when the subsidies run out, has become 
routine. Serious questions must be raised as to whether the Northern Ireland taxpayer is getting value for money 
from these arrangements, especially given the fact that Northern Ireland already has a world class airport to 
connect it to the globe: Dublin. Dublin has a far richer network of airlines and destinations than all of the three 
Northern Ireland airports (Belfast City, Belfast International ...ty of Derry) combined. 
I used data from openflights.org to find out the destinations available, both direct and with a change, from Northern 
Ireland and Dublin. The data is a couple of years old, so will not reflect new routes since 2015, but still includes the 
flight from Belfast International to Newark. The three Northern Ireland airports offered direct flights to 13 countries, 
and with a change of plane (mostly in London), offered indirect flights to 81 countries. Dublin, by comparison, 
offered direct flights to 35 countries, and with a change of plane offered destinations in 146 countries (airlines that 
fly point to point such as easyJet and Ryanair were excluded from the change of plane analysis). The far greater 
choice of destinations offered by Dublin can be seen quite clearly in the maps below (a black dot denotes a direct 
destination, a red dot means it can be accessed with one change). Dublin Airport is an essential link to Northern 
Ireland's export markets. The table below shows the top 10 countries for Northern Ireland exports for the first three 
quarters of 2016. Absent cross border trade, the largest destinations for exports are the United States and Canada. 
Northern Ireland has no direct all year round flights to anywhere in these countries, whilst Dublin offers dozens of 
flights a week.It also offers a far greater choice of flights to destinations in East Asia and the Gulf, which will 
become of paramount importance following the UK's exit from the European Union, as local exporters attempt to 
grow exports to the rest of the world to mitigate against possible impediments to exports to the EU. The money 
needlessly wasted subsidizing unviable airline routes would be put to much better use improving access to Dublin 
Airport, such as improving the safety of the A1, and fixing the bottleneck at Sprucefield. It is also pointless for 
Northern Ireland to have three airports when one would suffice. There will always be a demand for flights from 
Northern Ireland to Britain, and to ferry holidaymakers to destinations such as Mallorca and Malaga. However, the 
endless subsidies on offer to airlines to induce them to fly to Northern Ireland, only for them to leave when they are 
expected to stand on their own two feet, is an utter waste of taxpayers' money. Dublin Airport is Northern Ireland's 
gateway to the world. Instead of throwing more money on the bonfire of public subsidies, policymakers should 
Dublin Airport - Northern Ireland 's gateway to the world
spend their energies making sure that no post-Brexit border arrangements put barrier-free access to the airport in 
jeopardy.Related

Sounds good, doesn't it?Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told the Tuesday edition of German business daily 
"Handelsblatt" the budget carrier's ultimate goal was to do away with ticket prices altogether one day.He indicated 
that an airline where customers could get all tickets for free would certainly be very attractive, giving it an edge over 
competitors.Talking about the need to make a profit anyway, O'Leary said the money would then have to come 
from a range of smaller services, including snacks, internet connections and advertising."One day I want to have all 
the air fares on Ryanair being free, the chief executive told "Handelsblatt.""Ancillary revenues already make up 30 
percent of our [total] revenues." As to free tickets for all, O'Leary added "we might never get there, but at least it's 
the objective."No flights to USHe also confirmed earlier reports that Ryanair had ditched its plans for trans-Atlantic 
flights due to a shortage of planes.O'Leary had said earlier that such flights were postponed for the next years, but

Jan 28, 2017( Slugger O'Toole: http://www.sluggerotoole.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Derry's days as a regional 
transport hub appear to be largely behind it. In better times the city has served as a hub for shipbuilding, an 
international naval base, a thriving export centre and a key departure point for emigrants. Nowadays, the sole 
legacy of that is a small but important port facility at Lisahally. Meanwhile, the town which bore witness to Amelia 
Earhart making aviation history 85 years ago contains a regional airport that survives largely through Council 
subsidies. 
And with its key tenant (Ryanair) all but withdrawing from the facility, its future is under some question. As for rail - 
until the 1960s Derry was an important hub with four different rail lines ...ations offering links in every direction, and 
a further network of commuter stations in its hinterland. Nowadays the city has just a single station on the slow and 
infrequent line to Belfast, with the next nearest stop 20 miles away - making Derry the most isolated station on 
Northern Ireland's rail network. And finally there's road. Despite being promised a motorway connection to Belfast 
for the last 50 years, Derry remains the only city on the island of Ireland that isn't connected by a motorway or dual 
carriageway. With the kind of infrastructure that would make a third world nation blush, it is little wonder that Derry 
has languished at the top of the UK's unemployment table for years.However - the possibility of a major reboot for 
the city's infrastructure could arise from a very unexpected quarter. Whilst there is genuine concern at the impact 
Brexit may have on Northern Ireland, and particularly on border areas, being removed from the EU could potentially 
bring some unexpected benefits. Once Brexit is complete, the UK will resume full control over its own tariffs and 
taxes. And that has prompted some in Westminster to float the idea of creating 'Free Ports' and 'Free Trade Zones' 
- particularly in economically disadvantaged areas like Derry.Download a PDF of the map[1] Free Ports and Free 
Trade Zones Free Ports and Free Trade Zones are like Duty Free shops for industry - i.e. designated areas which, 
for customs purposes, are treated as if they were outside the country in which they are actually based. Foreign 
goods can enter Free Ports, go back out again or be stored there without incurring the usual taxes, tariffs and red 
tape. Tariffs are only paid on goods which leave the port and enter the local economy, though often at reduced 
rates. Free Trade Zones (FTZs) operate in a similar way, and are like an extension of a Free Port. Foreign goods 
can enter them without incurring any taxes, providing those goods are intended for re-export. For example, an FTZ 
could contain a car assembly plant - importing hundreds of components from around the world, and putting them 
together to create finished vehicles. By importing the foreign parts through the Free Port and assembling them 
within the Free Trade Zone customs duties and red tape would be avoided on those parts, and the finished cars 
would be cheaper to make and re-export. FTZs are therefore all about attracting investment, boosting 
manufacturing and employment and promoting international trade.A Global Phenomenon, Invented in Ireland There 
The Case for a 'Foyle Free Trade Zone'.
are over 3,500 Free Ports and FTZs in 135 countries around the world, providing employment for over 66 million 
people. The United States has over 250 FTZs hosting 420,000 jobs, and they have helped retain domestic 
manufacturing that would otherwise have moved elsewhere. Interestingly, Free Trade Zones are a concept that was 
invented right here in Ireland ! In the 1940s, planes had to stop in Ireland to refuel before continuing on to mainland 
Europe. Instead of taking the easy option of using Dublin Airport for this, the Irish Government instead saw an 
opportunity to boost regional development by establishing a new airport at Shannon. The plan worked well for a 
decade until the introduction of jet planes meant that Europe could be reached non-stop from the US. With the 
airport's future in jeopardy, the Irish Government again showed great imagination by creating the 'Shannon Free 
Zone' in 1959. This was an area around the airport which offered low taxes and duty-free incentives for businesses 
to locate there. It was the world's first Free Trade Zone, and was an instant success - accounting for a third of the 
Republic's goods exports within a decade. After Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, Shannon's perks had to be 
gradually removed. Regardless, the Shannon Free Zone is to this day the biggest multi-sector business park in the 
whole of Ireland - with over 100 international firms employing 7,000 people and generating â‚¬3.3bn in annual trade. 
It is also the island's largest recipient of foreign investment outside of Dublin.Post-Brexit Free Ports ? Although 
common elsewhere, there are currently no Free Ports or Free Trade Zones in the UK and EU regulation makes it 
nigh-on impossible to set any up. So in November the influential 'Centre for Policy Studies' in London published a 
report called 'The Free Ports Opportunity'. It recommended that the UK should seize the opportunity Brexit presents 
to establish Free Ports in disadvantaged port cities around the UK. They estimate that 86,000 new jobs could be 
created in this way, both at the ports themselves and via the manufacturing clusters that would develop nearby. For 
a Government nervous about Brexit, Free Ports offer two very attractive benefits. Firstly, they can be introduced 
quickly and easily - providing a rapid economic boost to reduce the negative impact from EU withdrawal. Secondly - 
as most ports in the UK are owned by independent statutory bodies rather than the State (including Foyle), they 
would require little or no government funding and could instead raise capital for themselves (contrast that with the 
impending reduction in Northern Ireland's Corporation Tax rate, which is expected to hit Stormont's block grant by 
Â£240m every year). A Free Port and Free Trade Zone in Derry could therefore provide the single biggest post-
wartime boost to the city's economy.Foyle Free Trade Zone So what might a Foyle Free Trade Zone look like ? Not 
only should it make Lisahally a Free Port, but by also granting the same status to City of Derry Airport the concept 
could be amplified dramatically. The 3 mile stretch of largely industrial and agricultural land between Foyle Port and 
the Airport could then serve as the Free Trade Zone - creating a huge new economic engine room bounded by two 
international transport hubs, Lough Foyle and the A2 (see map). This would not only usher in a golden era in 
manufacturing and logistics for the city, but would also provide a lifeline to its ailing transport infrastructure. City of 
Derry Airport's viability would be greatly improved with Free Port status, as would its value - enabling the council to 
not only remove subsidies, but to potentially sell it. And with the Derry to Belfast train line running through this new 
Free Trade Zone, a brighter future could also be envisioned for the railway. New rail stations at either end of the 
Free Trade Zone - one serving the Airport ...e fast growing village of Eglinton at its eastern end, and a second 
serving the Port ...d the neighbouring Strathfoyle community at its western end - would connect the FTZ and these 
two transport hubs directly into Ireland's rail network. It would also open up the possibility of rail freight returning to 
Northern Ireland for the first time since 2003, and reintroduce a commuter rail network for the city.Making the Case 
for Derry There is no guarantee that the UK Government will introduce Free Ports/Free Trade Zones, but the idea is 
certainly being discussed in Westminster circles. It is therefore vital that a new Stormont Government seizes the 
initiative and helps make the case both for Free Trade Zones in general, and for one located in NI. As with the Free 
State Government's decision in the 1930s to look beyond Dublin and towards Shannon, I would urge Stormont to 
likewise, for once, look beyond Belfast as the preferred location for any such facility in Northern Ireland. Derry has 
all the ingredients needed to create a Free Port - an existing port facility on a train line, with significant available 
land and a neighbouring airport. Derry and Strabane have the greatest economic need of any area in Northern 
Ireland - with an unemployment rate more than twice the UK average - such that a Free Port/FTZ in the north west 
would have a greater economic and social impact than in any other location. It would also be a catalyst for major 
improvement in the city's infrastructure, finally addressing a decades-long disparity which has stunted the region's 
economy and population growth. And from a practical and financial viewpoint, Derry has significantly more land 
available beside its port than Belfast does - especially as Belfast City Council intends to use a lot of its brownfield 
harbour land for housing. With land values significantly lower in Derry than in Belfast, locating such a facility in the 
north's second city would also come with a substantially lower price tag. Finally - locating such a facility on the 
Foyle would ensure that the best days are no longer all in the past for a city that what was once a great regional

and international transport hub. Fifty years ago the Irish government consciously looked beyond Dublin and created 
economic history at Shannon through foresight, creativity and a desire to spread economic benefits throughout their 
jurisdiction. For once Stormont should be persuaded to do the same, and to get behind a campaign to create a 
Foyle Free Trade Zone for Derry and the North-west region as a whole.Steve Bradley is a regeneration consultant,

published at ValueWalk[1]. Barron's[2] yearly or bi yearly? roundtable is out where Mario Gabelli talks deals, deals, 
deals, Jeff Gundlach talks a variety of topics, Scott Black talks investing, and Meryl Witmer of Berkshire Hathaway 
pitches her favorite investment ideas. 
Witmer mentions four stocks she likes - Dart Group, Ryanair, Linamar, and Virtu Financial the HFT firm ( that last 
one is a bit surprising) In an interview with Barron's[3] see full piece here[4] Witmer stated: Witmer: Dart Group 
[DTG.UK] is a U.K.-based airline operator and vacation packager with 148 million shares outstanding and a market 
cap of 740 million pounds [$912 million]. The stock is trading for 500 pence. While the shares are valued like an 
airline, the company is an outstanding operator in the leisure travel business. Philip Meeson is a passionate owner-
operator. He owns about 38% of the stock. . . Ryanair[5] [RYA.UK] also fell sharply and then rebounded, but this 
stock hasn't come back. Only two brokerages follow Dart, and the company doesn't do earnings conference 
calls.Witmer: My next pick is Linamar[6] [LNR.Canada]. It is a global auto-parts supplier, based about an hour from 
Toronto. . This is a great piece and for once Witmer was allowed to speak a bit so check the full thing out and the 
video interview. See more below and full piece from Barron's[7]here[8] Published on Jan 23, 2017 The Eagle

European airline title to Ryanair. Lufthansa reported a 1.8 per cent increase in 2016 passengers on Tuesday but it 
was not enough to stop Ryanair overtaking it as Europe's largest airline in terms of the number of people it carried.

Jan 10, 2017( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  Germany's largest airline 
is no longer Europe's largest. Modest growth in passenger numbers was not enough to fend off the fast-expanding 
Irish budget carrier.Figures released Tuesday showed Lufthansa's passenger numbers had fallen behind those of 
Irish budget carrier Ryanair for the first time.Lufthansa group - which owns Austrian Airlines, Swiss, and low-cost 
Eurowings - said it had carried a record 109.7 million passengers in 2016, up 1.8 percent on the year before.But 
this modest growth paled in comparison to Ryanair's 117 million passengers, 15 percent higher than in the previous 
year.Lufthansa has been plagued by a series of crippling strikes by pilots, but the 500,000 affected passengers 
would have had little effect on the overall figure.Hamburg-based aviation expert Cord Schellenberg told AFP news 
agency the numbers "should be a wake-up call for Lufthansa."The German carrier remains ahead of Ryanair in 
terms of revenue, and announced it would be adding Wi-Fi access to a large part of its fleet, a move likely to appeal 
to business travelers.Lufthansa is also increasing its challenge to Ryanair through its own budget subsidiary, 
Eurowings, which has absorbed another Lufthansa subsidiary, Germanwings.But Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr 
dampened speculation of atakeover of troubled budget carrier Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline, pointing 
to its inefficient cost structure. 
Lufthansa reached an agreement late last year to lease 33 planes from Air Berlin that will be operated by 
Eurowings.The figures came a day after an investigation closed into the March 2015 crash of a Germanwings jet in 
the French Alps that killed 150 people. The report concluded the mentally ill pilot acted alone in deliberately 
crashing the Airbus. Lufthansa faces legal action from families of the deceased.sgb/ (AFP, Reuters, AP)

A Trump-inspired trade war isn't Boeing 's biggest China concern
A Trump-inspired trade war isn't Boeing's biggest China concern

Jan 06, 2017( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  Beijing is planning to 
step up scrutiny of U.S. companies in the event that Donald Trump flips from trash-talking the cost of presidential 
aircraft to taking punitive measures against Chinese exports to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told 
Bloomberg News Friday. That's particularly bad news for Boeing because its Chinese business is unusually 
vulnerable to retaliatory action from the government. 
The measures could include scaling back government purchases or, alternatively, investigations by tax, antitrust or 
anti-dumping authorities, the people said.Just eight U.S. companies earned more than $5 billion in revenue from 
China in their last fiscal year. Five of them are semiconductor and electronics companies whose products are 
central to China's high-tech manufacturing ambitions. One â€” Apple Inc. â€” is a consumer business whose demand 
is driven by public taste rather than government fiat, while Yum! Brands Inc. has already spun off its China arm into 
a separate business. Boeing is in a different (flying) boat. Its biggest customers in the country â€” Air China Ltd., 
China Eastern Airlines Corp. and China Southern Airlines Co. â€” are all state-controlled. Most Read Stories 
Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]Even private carriers such as Hainan Airlines Co. know better than to go 
against the will of the government by ordering aircraft from a company in Beijing's bad books, especially when 
Airbus SE is offering comparable aircraft. There's a catch, though. While Boeing counts highly in the ranks of 
Chinese revenue earned by U.S. businesses, China isn't such an important part of the planemaker's order book. 
The 292 undelivered aircraft ordered by Chinese airlines and lessors make up just 5.5 percent of Boeing's total 
outstanding orders â€” and just 4.4 percent of the total at Airbus. India's SpiceJet Ltd. is close to finalizing an order 
for 92 Boeing 737s, people familiar with the matter told Anurag Kotoky and Julie Johnsson of Bloomberg News 
Friday, about a third the size of China Inc.'s entire outstanding order book.Looked at in those terms, China's 
aviation sector is only a bit more important to Boeing than its biggest customers Southwest Airlines Co. and Ryanair 
Holdings PLC, and significantly less important to Airbus than InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., known as IndiGo, and AirAsia 
Bhd. That's somewhat cold comfort. China's domestic aviation market will still be the world's biggest within 20 
years, according to Boeing's 2016-2035 market outlook, outstripping North America and Europe. The relatively 
slender nature of Chinese carriers' order books doesn't mean there's no demand pending.Rather, it's a sign that the 
country's airlines are holding fire until Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, starts producing its C919

Jan 04, 2017( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Separate complaints 
against the two companies have been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority, while the two adverts in 
question have been banned, the Telegraph[1] reports. A Ryanair television advert seen in October last year was 
found to be in breach of three broadcast advertising rules after on-screen text saying 'Fly from Â£19.99' was followed 
by larger text, which read 'Summer 2017 on sale now', despite the offer not applying to summer flights. 
The airline, whose controversial CEO Michael O'Leary last year revealed ambitions to make air travel free in the 
next 'five to 10 years', argued that the 'Summer 2017' text was a subsidiary message that appeared separately at 
the end of the advert, adding that there was a small on-screen disclaimer throughout the commercial that the offer 
only applied to travel before the end of March. But the ASA ruled that the wording was 'ambiguous' and said 
viewers were likely to understand the advert to mean that flights for summer 2017 were available from Â£19.99. 
'While we noted that the Â£19.99 offer was qualified by small text stating the start and end dates for the promotion, 
we considered that, given the conjunction of the offer with the claim 'Summer 2017 on sale now', the qualification 
was not sufficiently prominent to correct the overall impression that summer 2017 flights were included in the sale,' 
the watchdog said in its assessment. A Ryanair spokesman said: 'Ryanair disagrees with this ASA ruling, but has 
taken note of it in relation to future ads.' It was similarly scathing of an online advert seen on 
website LastMinute.com[2] in September, which promised deals of 'Â£569 Price per person Flight + hotel'. The ASA 
received a complaint after a customer booked the package but was then told the advertised price was no longer 
available. She was then told she would have to pay an additional Â£70.77. Despite the website's claims that the 
offers 'were dynamic and their availability was subject to change at any time', the ASA found that the price 
statement was misleading. It said: 'Approximately an hour after making a booking request for the package at the 
quoted price, the complainant was informed that the price had increased and they would need to pay an additional 
sum of Â£70.77 in order to maintain the booking.' [ 1]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/01/04/ryanair-

Ryanair Hopes to Feed Norwegian Long Haul Soon, But That's Just the Beginning
Ryanair Hopes to Feed Norwegian Long Haul Soon, But That's Just the 
Beginning
The Cranky Flier

Jan 03, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Last month it was reported that 
Ryanair was hoping to finalize a deal that would allow it to feed passengers on to Norwegian long-haul flights 
between Europe and the rest of the world[1]. This is an interesting agreement, but it isn't Ryanair's end game. The 
way Ryanair sees things, it and other low-cost carriers should be providing feed for every long-haul airline, 
replacing those who do it themselves.The idea of serving connecting traffic would have been anathema to Ryanair 
or easyJet just a few years ago. But with growth opportunities slowing, both carriers have started to look for ways to 
broaden their bases. 
They've become friendlier to business travelers, and they've started to consider things that add cost, simply 
because the extra revenue makes it worthwhile. One of these things involves connecting passengers. So far, 
Ryanair still won't connect people between even its own flights, though it has done experiments[2]. Yet it sounds 
like there will be a deal coming this quarter to connect Ryanair's short-haul passengers on to Norwegian's long-haul 
flights, and vice versa. Why would Ryanair want to do that? There are actually many reasons. You might wonder 
why Ryanair wouldn't just start its own long-haul operation. It still isn't convinced there's a way to do it profitably yet. 
Every time the rumor comes up, it ends up getting squashed. But if another airline wants to lose money trying 
something Ryanair doesn't think can work, why wouldn't Ryanair try to benefit from that? It would, and apparently, it 
will. Ryanair historically hasn't served many of the airports that handle the bulk of long-haul flying, but that has 
changed over time. With Norwegian it will be able to connect a fair number of people in Copenhagen and 
Barcelona. It has some more limited opportunities in other big cities too. But also, don't forget about the small cities. 
Norwegian will be starting more service from Cork to the US. Just imagine someone from Wroclaw (a city Ryanair 
serves from Cork today) flying through Cork to get over to New York. That's crazy, but it could be possible if this 
agreement happens. For Ryanair, there's a lot to be gained. Its fares within Europe are so low, that even a 
percentage of a low long-haul fare would still be worthwhile. Or it could end up that the airlines simply sell the sum 
of both local fares, in which case Ryanair gets its regular selling fare. Either way, Ryanair is happy since it's getting 
good money to carry more passengers. I'd be it ends up pushing the burden of connecting baggage on to 
Norwegian as well, so Ryanair wins there as well. This could end up helping the airline add more capacity. It could 
also displace lower-fare local passengers. Either way, Ryanair is happy. (Norwegian might not be, but then again, if 
it has a bunch of empty seats as it aggressively expands, then this will benefit that airline as well.) It's interesting to 
think about how this can help both airlines, but what really got me was a quote from Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's Chief 
Marketing Officer, in the article. 'What's in it for us is that it supports the logical development of the market the way 
Ryanair Hopes to Feed Norwegian Long Haul Soon, But That's Just the Beginning
we would want to see the market develop,' he said, adding that short-haul flying in Europe should primarily be 
handled by low-cost carriers. This is really what Ryanair is aiming for; the elimination of inefficient competition. I just 
wrote about Alitalia yesterday[3] and its struggle to compete in the short-haul market. Wouldn't it be better off killing 
that money-sucking part of its business and outsourcing to a lower-cost provider? The unions don't think so, but for 
Alitalia it may very well be a smart path forward. Certainly IAG-group airlines are interested in that model and are 
already experimenting with it as Vueling gets further integrated into the group. I don't expect the big guys to walk 
away from short-haul flying entirely, but it's hard to argue that they're providing a much better experience than what 
Ryanair offers today.  British Airways has already thrown a ton of seats into its cabins, pulled free food, and more 
making the differentiation far less than it used to be. Other airlines are lining up to follow. Even the premium cabin 
on European short-haul flights is laughable. You're just as well off in an exit row on Ryanair. The difference may be 
in the ground experience, but that's something that can still be controlled by the long-haul airline. Ryanair clearly 
thinks this kind of relationship is going to grow in the future, and easyJet is onboard with that vision as well. A deal 
with 
Norwegian 
may 
just 
be 
a 
small 
test 
of 
what's 
to 
come 
in 
broader 
terms.

Ringing In the New Year In the Best Way: An Alitalia Restructuring
Ringing In the New Year In the Best Way: An Alitalia Restructuring
The Cranky Flier

Jan 02, 2017( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Happy New Year, everyone! It's 
that time of year where people try to change for the better. We make resolutions, try to improve ourselves, and work 
so that the next time the calendar changes, we're in a better place. 
For some of us, that happens but not for the worst airline ever, Alitalia. See, 2017 was supposed to be the year of 
Alitalia's return to profitability under the Etihad restructuring plan. Will that happen? Hahahahahaha. No. Instead, 
we have Alitalia restructuring plan #3,405. I love this airline. You may remember that Alitalia's restructuring plan 
from two years ago[1] when Etihad stepped in was fairly straightforward. The airline planned to cut short-haul flying 
(and ditch some narrowbodies), expand long-haul flying (and add widebodies), cozy up further with SkyTeam and 
Etihad/airberlin partners, and go more upscale. That plan did not work. Despite making some progress in 2015, 
2016 looks like bad news all around. Reports say that Alitalia is losing half a million euros a day[2], and that might 
be conservative. Where did the plan go wrong? Well, Etihad Aviation Group's CEO James Hogan blames pretty 
much everyone else. In a wide-ranging interview he did with Corriere Della Sera[3] back in October, Hogan said 
Etihad knows very well how to restructure an airline, so with Alitalia it must be everyone else's fault. That includes: 
European Union: 'One of the key issues for us was to be able to use Linate and build a much stronger base in 
Linate and change the Bersani law, so that we could use more flights to fly further than Europe. Now unfortunately 
that's caught up in the European process, and it's also caught up in internal lobbying between Malpensa and 
Linate.'Italian Government: 'And we asked the government to put forward a fund to build a stronger tourist industry 
in Italy. It didn't happen in 2015 or in 2016.'Unions: 'I am disappointed with the trade unions too. When I did this 
deal I was very clear with them, I needed three years of industrial peace to rebuild this business. We are just 18 
months into it and in a dispute that was about something that cost the same as a cup of coffee they called a 
strike.'Terrorism, Brexit, and Low Cost Airlines: 'This year with terrorism, with Brexit, but also with the opening up of 
this market to low cost airlines average fares have been damaged.'Regional airports: 'The chariman and CEO of 
Alitalia have been very clear to regional airports by saying provide us with the same conditions [given to Ryanair] 
and let Alitalia compete.Air France/Delta: 'There are other elements that we have inherited from the past such as 
the pre-existing agreement with Air France and Delta which restricts the network development of Alitalia.'Whew. 
And to that, I can only wonder how is any of this surprising? Alitalia has long been dysfunctional, but much of that 
comes from simply doing business in Italy. I see nothing out of the ordinary here, and it was all entirely predictable. 
But now that the plan to reach profitability has fallen off the rails, what will Alitalia do? Enter new CEO Cramer Ball 
and his restructuring plan[4]. This plan is more of a 'plug the leak' kind of plan than a visionary go-forward type of 
plan. Alitalia is in a cash crunch, and it needs to show some sort of progress to attract money for another bail-out. It 
Ringing In the New Year In the Best Way: An Alitalia Restructuring
needs to do that quickly. This new plan sounds a whole lot like the old plan, according to reports that elaborate[5] 
on what has been publicly announced. Short-haul will get reworked again with more narrowbodies going away. 
(Though, strangely, Alitalia just announced a slew of new short-haul routes[6].) Cost cuts are needed, so you can 
probably expect some backing-away from the upscale strategy, at least on short-haul flying. Alitalia will beef up 
long-haul flying again, but that may require renegotiating or backing out of its joint venture with Delta/Air France. 
And of course, job cuts are coming. How do you think this is going to be received? Not well, of course. You think the 
unions are going to like more job and cost cuts? Of course not. And do you think the government is going to really 
be an ally and not a roadblock? Yeah, right. If Alitalia does somehow pull this together, then Etihad will apparently 
lend the airline money to keep it going. Etihad can't put any more equity in since it's already at the foreign 
ownership limit. Of course, Etihad has been rethinking its entire investment strategy anyway, so it makes you 
wonder if this grand experiment is coming to an end. If so, don't fret. Sure, Alitalia might have to find a new owner, 
but like a (fashionably-dressed) cockroach, it'll never really die. There have been rumors about Lufthansa being 
interested in bringing the airline into the fold. That would be hilarious and bad, but it would keep Alitalia flying. And 
really, that's what matters most. Because you can't be the worst airline ever if you don't exist. [ 1]:

promotional themes will include coastal routes, including the Wild Atlantic Way and the Causeway Coastal Route; 
living historical stories and Ireland's Ancient East; as well as city breaks to Dublin and Belfast. A major TV 
advertising campaign will kick off in mid-February, reaching about 16m potential French holidaymakers. The 
campaign will be supported by digital advertising and co-operative activity with partners such as Irish Ferries, Aer 
Lingus, Brittany Ferries, Ryanair and Transavia. The organisation will also ramp up its publicity programme in 
France, placing increased focus on digital channels and working more closely with online media, including bloggers. 
French tour operators and travel agents, as well as business tourism buyers, will be targeted through workshops, 
familiarisation visits to Ireland and a presence at IFTM (International French Travel Market). Monica MacLaverty, 
Tourism Ireland's Manager for Southern Europe, said: 'We will work closely with our tourism partners - at home and

Dec 12, 2016( Market Folly: http://www.marketfolly.com Delivered by Newstex)  We're posting notes from the Sohn 
London investment conference 2016[1]. Next up is Adrian Croxson head of European Equities at Och-Ziff 
Management who pitched long Ryanair (LON:RYAN). Adrian Croxson's Sohn London Conference 
PresentationLong Ryanair Holdings (LON: RYAN) Och-Ziff have owned Ryanair stock for two years. Ryanair's own 
projections suggest that they can grow volumes at 8% per year for the next 8 years. 
They have enough capacity to do that because they have lower costs. They fly 120 million passengers per year. 
Demand for air travel will continue to grow. Ryanair keeps taking market share from competitors. It can grow market 
share from 15% to 25% over the next few years.It is the lowest cost producer in Europe with 50% less overhead 
than main competitor Easyjet. Staff costs are low due to route density not necessarily because they pay staff less. 
They require fewer crews as staff can work out of more than one airport. Landing costs for Ryanair have been flat 
over the last couple of years because they have gone into airports where other airlines have gone bust. They have 
a good record for buying planes cheaply as they tend to buy when demand is low. They are getting better at cross 
selling passengers hire cars and hotels. They do not spend a lot of money on marketing.Net income can double in 
the next seven years and the share count will diminish due to buybacks. The CEO owns Â£1bn of stock. Be sure to

http://lenpenzo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/black-coffee-christmas-breweddaily_com.jpegIt's time to sit 
back, relax and enjoy a little joe  Welcome to another rousing edition of Black Coffee, your off-beat weekly round-up 
of what's been going on in the world of money and personal finance. Off we go  'How did you go bankrupt?' Bill 
asked. 
'Two ways,' Mike said. 'Gradually and then suddenly.' â€• Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises Credits and 
Debits Debit: Uh oh. Don't look now, but next month United Airlines will begin charging some customers who use 
their overhead luggage bins. No, really[1]. Don't blame United for starting this, though. Budget carrier Spirit has 
been charging $30 to use overhead storage[2] since 2010. Sheesh. What's next? Debit: I know what you're 
thinking: When will they start charging to use the lavatory? Try seven years ago â€” at least that's when Ryanair 
floated a trial balloon about charging their customers to pee[3]. Needless to say, after hearing from lots of, well 
pissed-off customers, the airline wisely backed off that 'money-making' idea. Credit: Speaking of pissed-off 
clientele, shoppers in the People's Socialist Paradise of VenezuelaTM now have to stand in six different ATM 
lines[4] to accumulate enough of their hyperinflating bolivars just so they can buy approximately a dollar's worth of 
rice. Adelante! Debit: Ya know those Chavistas should be thankful they don't live in Belgium, where revenue-
starved government officials recently reinstituted a 40-cent dance tax[5] on anyone who chooses to cut the rug at 
local cafes and other nightspots. To pay a similar tariff in Venezuela using bolivars, somebody without any cash 
would have to stand in at least two ATM lines before they would have enough currency. Credit: Meanwhile, here in 
the US, the euphoric stock market rally continues, as the major indices set new all-time highs. For the week, the 
S...urged another 3.1%, and the Dow gained 2.7%. In fact, the Dow appears to be on pace to log its fastest 1000-
point rally[6] since a 24-day trading period in 1999 when the Dow jumped from 10,000 to 11,000. Now if we only 
knew why. Credit: For Wall St. analyst Michael Block, the rally is unjustifiable[7]: 'Everything is a buying opportunity. 
Brexit? Bullish. Trump winning? Bullish. Italy rejecting the referendum and the Prime Minister resigning? Bullish. 
Heck, all we need is a coup in India and the Belgian banking system to go kablooey and the S...ill be at 3000 by 
Christmas.' Forget fundamentals, Mike. Just shut up and buy! Credit: Then again, magnifying the apparent insanity, 
gold and silver prices continue to plummet despite soaring demand. Yes, it's senseless â€” but, unlike the stock 
market where the general public enjoys chasing higher prices, economic rationality[8] exists in precious metals â€” at 
least for the moment â€” where physical bullion buyers have been taking advantage of the low prices to buy more. 
Debit: Of course, earlier this year Deutsche Bank admitted to rigging gold and silver prices. And this week, 
documents it disclosed[9] as part of the settlement clearly suggest that UBS Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Bank 
Black Coffee: Who Wants a Big Slice of Pie-in-the-Sky?
of Nova Scotia and other firms have been manipulating the silver market too. You can bet the continuing 
inexplicable price action in both silver and gold means it's still underway. Credit: As Avery Goodman observes, 'If 
natural market forces were permitted to run free, naive folks would win[10] the game, and insiders would lose a 
fortune.' The good news is, truth always prevails. True, it may take awhile â€” but all Ponzi schemes and financial 
frauds eventually self-destruct. Debit: Sadly, this scam is so big it's going to financially decimate almost everyone 
who isn't insured with physical gold or silver[11]. The good news is precious metals are on sale â€” at least while the 
banking industry has its thumb on the scale. Credit: Finally the Dallas Police and Fire Pension Board ended a 
run[12] on its failing retirement fund, stopping $154 million in withdrawals â€” but not before newly-retired police and 
firefighters trying to 'get theirs' ahead of any potential bankruptcy managed to walk off with more than $500 million. 
That kind of gives new meaning to the term 'first responders,' doesn't it? Debit: In the end it doesn't matter; almost 
all government pensions are de facto Ponzi schemes[13] â€” look no further than the one in Dallas, which 
guaranteed pie-in-the-sky 8% returns plus a 4% annual inflation benefit, so its no wonder their fund is broke. If you 
don't think this is a sign of what's coming to all government pensions, you best think again. Credit: By the way, 
Dallas isn't the only government pension fund in distress right now. Remember, a shocking number of state and 
local pension funds are struggling[14] to stay solvent â€” even though the stock and bond markets at or near all-time 
highs. With that in mind, it's not hard to imagine how quickly they'll melt away when the stock and bond bears finally 
reassert themselves. By the Numbers Wednesday was the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Here are 
a few numbers regarding that fateful day: 4000 Miles between Japan and Hawaii. 353 Aircraft used by Japan during 
the attack. 75 Minutes that the attack lasted. 2403 US personnel killed. Another 1178 were wounded. 1177 Sailors 
who were killed instantly on the USS Arizona when an 1800-lb bomb struck the ship. 5 Number of midget 'suicide' 
submarines[15] used by the Japanese during the attack. 68 Number of US civilians who were killed during the 
attack. 19 US Navy ships destroyed, including eight battleships. 0 Aircraft carriers destroyed. They were all 
practicing maneuvers on the open ocean. Source: St. Louis Today[16] Last Week's Poll Result How much is your 
Christmas gift budget this year? $101 to $500 (53%) More than $500 (29%) $100 or less (18%) More than 1300 
people participated in last week's poll and nearly 3 in 10 of them have a Christmas budget that's more than $500.

Berlin logs new air passenger record

Dec 02, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  The number of travelers 
using Berlin's airports has risen considerably in the course of the year. A month before the end of 2016, officials 
confirmed a new all-time record - a fresh challenge for the German capital.Berlin's airports, Tegel and SchÃ¶nefeld, 
have handled over 30 million passengers this year so far, officials told the DPA news agency on Friday.The number 
is already higher than any recorded for a single year, and with one month to go until the end of the year, Berlin's 
airport operators expect the tally to increase to 32 million travelers for the whole of 2016.In the January-to-October 
period, passenger numbers were 11.7 percent higher than in the same 9-month period a year earlier. 
Operators attributed the significant rise to Berlin's growing attraction for tourists and increased activities in the city 
by budget airlines such as Ryanair ad Easyjet.Fit for the future?A decade ago, Berlin's airports only logged 18.5 
million travelers, and it was then that building work for the new Berlin-Brandenburg airport began. It's still not 
completed, with the future aviation hub having become a byword for bad administration.The much-delayed airport 
has suffered a series of failures, from a roof that was too heavy to a fire-protection system that defied gravity. The 
total bill ballooned from 1.7 billion euros ($1.82 billion) to more than 5 billion euros by 2016.The airport is expected 
to open in late 2017 or early 2018, more than five years after the original target date.But once it's open, it'll only be 
able to handle about 27 million passengers a year. With Berlin-Tegel set to close down, this means that the current 
airport at SchÃ¶nefeld, which shares one of the new airport's two runways, will have to be kept open at least for a 
transitional period to cope with growing passenger numbers.hg/sgb (dpa, AFP)

Nov 24, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  Germany's flagship 
carrier Lufthansa has announced hundreds more flight cancellations Friday and Saturday, as a pilots' strike over a 
pay dispute continues unabated. Already, the costs of the industrial action are huge.Lufthansa announced on 
Thursday it would cancel a further 830 short-and medium-haul flights on Friday to adapt to a continued strike by its 
pilots over a pay dispute.This means that just over a quarter of the airline's schedule will be affected Friday, hitting 
more than 100,000 travelers. 
Germany's flagship carrier added that most long-haul flights would not be affected.Lufthansa board member Harry 
Hohmeister said cancellations for the first two days of the strike, meaning Wednesday and Thursday, had already 
cost the airline some 20 million euros ($21 million), and customers were making fewer bookings."Not only have we 
suffered severe damage from the strike, but we're noticing from mid-term booking numbers that customer behavior 
is changing," Hohmeister said in a statement.Competitive pressuresThe pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit (VC), 
wants a backdated average pay increase of 3.7 percent annually for 4,500 pilots in Germany over a five-year period 
from 2012. Management for its part is offering 2.5 percent annually over six years to 2019.The airline has urged the 
union to enter mediation several times, but VC officials have said they first wanted Lufthansa to table a better 
offer.CEO Carsten Spohr insists that despite a record profit in 2015, Lufthansa has no choice but to cut costs to 
compete with rivals such as discount airline Ryanair on short-haul flights, and Emirates on long-haul flights.hg/nz

Nov 15, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Global broadband 
services and technology company, ViaSat Inc. VSAT[1] expanded its aircraft operation capabilities with the 
acquisition of Arconics, which provides pioneering software solutions to the aviation industry.The financial details of 
the deal have been kept under wraps. The transaction is not expected to have a material impact on ViaSat's non-
GAAP earnings for fiscal 2017.ViaSat had a partnership with Arconics prior to the acquisition, which focused on 
catering to the wireless In-flight Entertainment ('IFE') needs of airline customers.Arconics offers a connected aircraft 
software platform, which enables wireless IFE, Electronic Flight Bag ('EFB'), Airline Document Management and 
Cabin Management solutions. 
The platform helps communicate and share data with the aircraft and leverages on the available connectivity to

they depend on its software to operate their fleets safely and efficiently. Arconics's clients include Qatar Airways, 
Tigerair Australia, Ryanair, Cathay Pacific, Philippine Airlines, Aer Lingus and SpiceJet, among others.The buyout 
will enable ViaSat to acquire aviation-grade software, broader expertise and mobile applications, which will boost 
safety and efficiency of flying for pilots, cabin crews and flight operations teams. ViaSat will also gain access to 
entertainment applications and will be able to explore opening new service and revenue opportunities.ViaSat also 
intends to provide services like real-time insight, control and agility of aircraft and flight data. For this, ViaSat can 
leverage on its advanced high capacity Ka-band satellite network to create highly-integrated, highly-customizable 
aircraft operations tools.Thus, adding Arconics' capabilities will position ViaSat as the market leader for 
connectivity, passenger services and flight deck applications and operations, and enable it to deliver end-to-end 
experiences across the aircraft value-chain.ViaSat's Commercial Air business is proving to be a key profit driver, 
strongly supplementing growth. Going forward, the company's expansion strategies, higher value service plans, and

after failing to reach an agreement with Germany's largest airline in a long-running dispute over pilots' salaries. The

Cockpit is demanding an average annual pay increase of 3.66 percent. Lufthansa has made around 5 billion euros 
in profit over the past five years, but pilots' wages have failed to keep up with inflation."Effective wage decreases in 
the same period in which a company records a profit is unacceptable," Cockpit president Ilja Schulz said in a 
statement.Competition with budget airlinesThis will be the fourteenth strike in relation to the present wage dispute. 
A strike by Lufthansa pilots in April forced Germany's largest airline to ground nearly 900 flights, affecting hundreds 
of thousands of travelers.Lufthansa has been cutting costs in an effort to compete with budget airlines like Ryanair. 
Schulz said that the union "considers the success of Lufthansa very important."ae/ksb (AFP, dpa, Reuters)

Nov 07, 2016( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  DUBLIN (AP) â€” 
Ryanair shares rose 5 percent on Monday after Europe's top budget airline said it expects to carry more than 200 
million passengers annually by 2024, 11 percent higher than previously forecast. The Dublin-based carrier offered 
the stronger long-term outlook as part of its half-year results for the tourism-driven April-September period, when 
the airline carries the bulk of its customers.Ryanair shook off last month's profits warning pegged to the summer 
slide in the value of the British pound following the United Kingdom referendum to leave the European Union. 
Ireland is in the euro currency zone but Ryanair does 26 percent of its business in Britain, where customers pay for 
products priced in sterling. The airline said it carried 65 million passengers in the first half of the fiscal year, a 12 
percent gain versus April-September 2015. Sales increased 2 percent to 4.1 billion euros ($4.6 billion) while net 
profit rose 7 percent to nearly 1.19 billion euros ($1.32 billion). Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 
weeks.[1]Ryanair expects to carry a company-record 119 million passengers in this fiscal year as the airline 
pursues a strategy of relentless expansion across the continent, most prominently Germany. Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary says Ryanair plans this winter to expand services in Berlin and Frankfurt and open six new bases 
in the German cities of Hamburg and Nuremburg as well as Bucharest, Romania; Prague, Czech Republic; Vilnius, 
Lithuania, and Bournemouth on England's south coast. O'Leary said he stood by the airline's negatively revised 
profits forecast issued in mid-October anticipating net profits of 1.3 billion euros to 1.35 billion euros when full-year 
fiscal 2017 earnings are published in May. He said profits would be constrained by the airline's policy of filling 
aircraft by offering steeply discounted fares when necessary. Fares fell 10 percent in the April-September period to 
an average price of 50 euros ($55.35) per one-way ticket, an approach that allowed Ryanair to set a new load factor 
record of 95 percent of seats sold. Ryanair shares surged on the Irish Stock Exchange to a 4 1/2-month high of 
13.54 euros, nearly reaching a level last seen hours before the U.K. vote June 23 to leave the EU. The shares were

Nov 07, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Yves 
HermanAs the prospect of a hard Brexit looms, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary made some dire predictions about its 
effect on UK airlines.  When asked about a hard Brexit during the Irish low-cost carrier's latest earnings call, 
O'Leary replied that while it's still two years away from happening, the expected effect on his airline will not be 
substantial. But, the chief executive warned that his UK rivals may not be so lucky. (A "hard" Brexit means that the 
UK would make a clean break from the EU and fully relinquish its access to the European single market. 
In that case, the UK's economic relationship with the EU would fall under World Trade Organization rules until 
individual trade agreements can be negotiated.) "However, the impact on our competitors, particularly our UK 
competitors, will be much more severe," O'Leary said. "For example, EasyJet has about 40% of its capacity 
operating on intra-EU routes and we would find it difficult that a UK registered airline would be able to operate intra-
EU routes in a hard Brexit scenario." EasyJet is the UK's largest low-cost carrier and Ryanair's main rival for 
dominance over British skies. O'Leary's comment stem from the potential regulatory limitations UK airlines such as 
Easyjet and British Airways will face if Britain makes a complete break from the EU. As part of the EU, UK 
airlines can operate flights around Europe without limitations. However, in a hard Brexit, UK airlines operating flights 
inside Europe would be seen as no different than one from China or the US â€” should a UK/EU open skies 
agreement not be reached. As a result, there could be severe limitations on access to routes and markets in which 
UK airlines are currently major players.  Representatives from Easyjet were not immediately available for comment 
on the matter. O'Leary's predictions for International Airlines Group[1] â€” the parent company of British Airways, 
Iberia, and Irish national airline Aer Lingus â€” is even more dire.  "I think the shareholder structure of IAG becomes 
untenable in a hard Brexit," the Ryanair CEO added. "British Airways cannot be owned by the same shareholders 
as Aer Lingus and Iberia and I think it would lead to the breakup of IAG should a hard Brexit emerge in two years 
time." This arrangement has worked well for the company, which formed in 2011 after the merger of British Airways 
and Spain's national airline, Iberia. Foreign-ownership restrictions for airlines are customary around the world. The 
US limits foreign ownership to 25%, while the EU's cap is at 49.9%. Because British Airways is now 100% owned 
by an EU company, IAG may be put in a position in which it will have to divest its holdings. However, IAG doesn't 
seem particularly bothered by the Brexit. At least towards the public and the press, the company has remained 
steadfast it is stance that the Brexit will not have a major effect on its business. Following the Brexit vote in June, 
IAG chief financial officer Enrique Dupuy de Lome issued a statement[2] saying that "the vote to leave the 
European Union will not have a long term material impact on its business." On Monday, an IAG spokesperson 
One of Europe's most famous airline CEOs just made some chilling predictions about the effect of a hard Brexit
reiterated the same stance in a statement to Business Insider which read, "IAG has said, on many occasions, that 
in the long term Brexit would not have a significant impact on our business." Ryanair reported a $1.29 billion profit 
for the first half of 2016 with net margins up 1 point to 28%. NOW WATCH: Here's why Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. ET is

has reported a strong rise in bottom-line earnings for the third quarter. But competition for Europe's largest carrier is 
mounting, with low-budget airline Ryanair expanding in Germany.Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa on 
Wednesday reported a 79-percent rise in net profit for the third quarter year on year to 1.4 billion euros ($1.55 
billion).The airline said it profited from cost-cutting measures and a settlement with some employee groups on 
pension plans, enabling it to wash provisions of over 700 million euros back into its coffers.Adjusted earnings, that 
is profit before interest and taxes, dropped by 6.5 percent to 1.15 billion euros. 
Lufthansa also reported a decline in third-quarter sales to 8.8 billion euros, marking a 1-percent drop in 
revenues.Ryanair's attack"The Lufthansa Group is developing with stability in a difficult market environment," CEO 
Carsten Spohr said in a statement. "We're responding to the pricing pressures in the air transport sector with 
consistent capacity and cost discipline."Pressure on Europe's largest carrier is mounting as Ireland's Ryanair, the 
biggest low-budget airline on the Continent, is sticking to its plans to speed up its expansion program in Germany, 
Lufthansa's home turf, and steal away customers.Fourth-quarter results may be dented by strikes at Lufthansa 
subsidiaries Eurowings and Germanwings last week which grounded about 400 flights as a result of an unresolved 
contract dispute with employees.hg/jd (dpa, Reuters)

Nov 02, 2016( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  FRANKFURT, Germany 
(AP) â€” Low-cost airline Ryanair is starting flights from the German city of Frankfurt, which is the main hub for 
Lufthansa â€” a move that opens a new front in the German carrier's battle with no-frills competitors. Ryanair said 
Wednesday it would base two aircraft in Frankfurt and fly to vacation destinations Alicante, Malaga, and Palma de 
Mallorca in Spain, as well as to Faro in Portugal.Low-cost airlines often choose secondary airports rather than main 
hubs such as Frankfurt, where costs can be higher. 
Low-cost airlines have accounted for only about 4 percent of passenger traffic at Frankfurt's main airport. Ryanair 
says it will keep flying from much-smaller Frankfurt-Hahn airport some 125 kilometers (78 miles) to the west of 
Frankfurt. The CEO of airport operator Fraport, Stefan Schulte, said Ryanair was being offered a break on fees in 
line with international practice of 40 to 50 percent in the first year, to be phased out in three years, the dpa news 
agency reported. Fraport has submitted its fee incentive plan to the transport ministry of the local Hessen region for 
approval. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]Ralf Teckentrup, the head of competitor 
Condor that also flies out of Frankfurt's main airport, said the incentives were a 'competition-distorting subsidy 
model.' Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Lufthansa expected to be allowed to take advantage of the same lower 
fees and said it might move flights by its low-cost arm, Eurowings, to Frankfurt. Lufthansa under Spohr has made 
sweeping changes to its business to meet competition from low-cost airlines within Europe and from state-backed 
Gulf airlines Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways on long-haul routes. It has launched Eurowings, which 
flies to popular leisure destinations. Lufthansa has also pushed premium economy class seats with a bit more room 
to tempt economy class passengers to spend more. The news came as Lufthansa said its third-quarter net profit 
rose to 1.42 billion euros ($1.57 billion) from 794 million euros on reduced costs and a new pension deal with

Nov 02, 2016( TheNextWeb.com: http://thenextweb.com Delivered by Newstex)  In the United States, in-flight Wi-Fi 
is a fact of life. The vast majority of major airlines offer it. 
It's pricey and slow, sure, but it also allows you to stay connected at 33,000 feet. In Europe, it's a different story. 
Only a handful of airlines offer in-flight Wi-Fi, and they're not the major ones, like Ryanair and EasyJet. But this will 
soon change. British Airways owner IAG has announced that the airline will start to offer the service on its short-
haul routes from 2017[1]. Other IAG-owned airlines, including Aer Lingus, Iberia, and Vueling, will also get the 
service. In total 341 planes will be fitted with Wi-Fi systems, which will connect to Inmarsat's communications 
satellites. IAG reportedly told the BBC that it will be up to each individual airline whether they want to charge 
passengers an access fee, and how much it will cost. This means that there will likely be radically different pricing 
structures across the IAG family. On many of their long-haul routes, Aer Lingus and Iberia offer in-flight Wi-Fi. 
Iberia's offering has been criticized for being overpriced, with 22 MB of Internet access costing just shy of $20[2]. 
British Airways had previously announced that it intends to fit its longhaul fleet with Wi-Fi[3] from the Chicago-based 
GoGo. This will be centered on its 2ku technology, which offers speeds of up to 70Mbps. The news comes at a 
really unusual time for British Airways. Under the leadership of CEO Alex Cruz, the legacy carrier has started 
cutting back on amenities, including free meals and drinks on short-haul flights. This may placate disillusioned 
customers who would be tempted to jump ship to its cheaper, low-cost rivals.  British Airways to offer wi-fi on short-

compared with 2015, but down from the 10-percent increase the company predicted at the end of July.Britain's vote

disruption as a result of air traffic control strikes.A weaker pound makes it more expensive for Britons to travel 
abroad.

Heathrow's New Runway is Sort Of, Kind Of Approved
Heathrow's New Runway is Sort Of, Kind Of Approved

Oct 27, 2016( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  If you think airport projects 
move slowly here in the US, just take a look at the UK. This week the semi-go-ahead was finally given to a new 
third runway at Heathrow. This has been in discussion for decades, and it's long overdue. 
But we aren't at the end of the line yet. I'm still not convinced this will happen. The UK has dug its heels in for years 
when it comes to adding airport capacity. That, among other things, has led to a shift away from Heathrow as being 
nearly as important as it used to be in the global air travel system. London has a lot of airports, but its two most 
important, Heathrow and Gatwick, are bursting at the seams. Heathrow's two runways have been at capacity for 
years, and its status as a global hub has waned. Gatwick, which is known as a leisure travel mecca, has had a 
tremendous resurgence with the likes of easyJet and Norwegian launching aircraft off its single runway all day long, 
leaving it near capacity. This most recent decision to add a runway by the government was technically between 
Gatwick and Heathrow, but in the past there has been discussion about an additional runway at Stansted as well. 
The obvious answer is to add runways wherever they're needed, and that includes Heathrow and Gatwick along 
with Stansted. In fact, Ryanair CEO Michael Leary said effectively that[1] in his response to this decision that 
Heathrow had won. But any growth in runways in London is nearly impossible to achieve. So settling for only one 
runway at Heathrow? That's still a giant leap forward in a country that has done nothing but try to harm air travel. Of 
course, this decision isn't really a final decision. That would be way too simple. The government will take this to the 
public for 'consultations' before making a final decision, though it says that won't stop it from happening sure. Then 
more than a year from now (next winter, sometime) they'll take this to Parliament to vote. Then and only then can 
they move forward, assuming the hundreds of lawsuits that will inevitably be filed haven't stopped it. We're a 
decade away from seeing the runway, at best. Is it likely to actually occur? Well, I've given up trying to predict. 
People in West London are against it, because, well, they don't want more noise. But people elsewhere in the 
country are certainly for it, because it will likely enable more connections into the capital from those other places. 
So, if the government keeps its word and pushes forward, it sounds like Parliament shouldn't be an issue. Maybe by 
2018 we'll have an idea if this will actually happen. Or maybe not. In the meantime, we'll see all kinds of anger and 
fighting and jockeying for position on how this should (or shouldn't) happen. British Airways, the largest user of 
Heathrow, has already made it clear that it wants a new runway if it doesn't have to pay for it. This stance is actually 
pretty shrewd. The reality is that for British Airways, it has more to lose by seeing an additional runway. At this 
point, it controls a tremendous amount of slots at the airport, and it doesn't have to worry about new entrant 
competition there. With a new runway, that changes. EasyJet has already indicated that it will fly to Heathrow if the 
new runway opens. So British Airways can straddle that line. It can say that it wants a new runway; it's great for the 
Heathrow's New Runway is Sort Of, Kind Of Approved
nation. But by saying that the airlines and consequently travelers shouldn't have to pay for it, it pushes it right back 
on the government or the private operator to figure out how else to pay the billions and billions of dollars involved. 
And we are talking about billions. Look at the map above and you can see that not only do wide swaths of people 
have to be relocated, but they have to bury the M25 motorway in a tunnel. (Either that or they are going to build the 
runway on a ramp over the M25[2]. Seriously.) I can't imagine this not hitting the rate base at all, so BA can raise a 
fuss without looking like the bad guy. It'll be doing it in the name of low costs and fares. Good thinking. In the end, 
London needs more airport capacity. And if they're only going to build one runway, I do think Heathrow is the 
obvious choice. But how do you pay for it? It's already an absurdly expensive airport from which to operate. Will 
there need to be a two-tiered system that allows for some sort of low-cost competition? It's almost like forcing low-
cost housing when you build a condo project. You can be sure British Airways will not be happy if something like 
that happens. All I really know is that I believe nothing until I actually see the runway being built. Sounds like a good 
Dorkfest for the blog's gold anniversary in 2056. [ 1]: http://www.cityam.com/252194/heathrow-expansion-green-

Oct 18, 2016( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  The budget airline said net 
profit would be â‚¬1.3bn to â‚¬1.35bn (Â£1.17bn-Â£1.2bn), 5 per cent below its earlier guidance, reports The BBC[1]. 
Ryanair said the pound's fall would cut the revenues they receive from fares in the second half by 13 per cent to 15 
per cent. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said while better cost control and stronger growth would help to offset the 
impact it was 'prudent' to adjust its guidance. 
He also cautioned that the airline's revised guidance was 'heavily dependent' on no further falls in the pound and no 
more cuts in the average revenues it received from fares. Earlier this month, rival Easyjet also warned the drop in 
the pound would cost it about Â£90m in the current financial year, more than double the Â£40m it estimated in July. 
Sterling has fallen by about 18 per cent against the dollar since the referendum. Aside from the hit from the falling 
pound, Ryanair said it was performing well. It expects to carry 119 million passengers this financial year, up 12 per 
cent on the previous year. It also said its load factor - basically how full its planes are - was expected to be 94 per 
cent, slightly better than it originally forecast. 'The recent sharp decline in sterling post Brexit will weaken second 
half yields by slightly more than we had originally expected,' Mr O'Leary said. 'While higher load factors, stronger 
traffic growth and better cost control will help to ameliorate these weaker revenues, it is prudent now to adjust full 
year guidance which will rise by approx. 7 per cent ([for the full year] rather than our original guidance of 12 per 
cent.' Cantor Fitzgerald Europe analyst Robin Byde told the BBC that part of the drop in profit guidance was due to 
Ryanair heavily discounting fares to compete with budget rivals as well as a weaker trading environment. 'There's a 
low level price war going on at the moment between these companies. Ryanair often claims it's a victim of the 
market, but actually it's often a price maker for the market,' he said. 'The number of passengers are growing and 
cabins are full. To do that they are discounting heavily.' Nonetheless, Mr Byde said the fundamentals of the firm 
remained 'very strong'. 'As a business they're in good shape,' he said. [ 1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-

'Dyre' malware resurfaces, targets Australian banks
'Dyre' malware resurfaces, targets Australian banks

Oct 18, 2016( IT Pro: http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  One of the most devastating banking Trojans, 
thought to have been subdued in 2015, has resurfaced with a new name to target financial institutions in Australia, 
new research suggests. The new malware bot, calling itself 'TrickBot', was recently discovered by Fidelis 
Cybersecurity[1] and shares "striking similarities" to the 'Dyre Trojan', which terrorised worldwide financial 
institutions in and caused tens of millions of dollars in damages between 2014-15. English-speaking countries were 
worst affected by the Dyre campaign, particularly the UK, US, and Australia. 
Those responsible for the Dyre Trojan attacks were arrested by Russian authorities in November 2015, and since 
then there has been no sign of the malware, effectively disappearing overnight. However, Jason Reaves, Fidelis 
threat researcher, believes at least some of those involved in the Dyre attacks may have resumed their criminal 
activities. "From first glance at the loader, called TrickLoader, there are some striking similarities between it and the 
loader that Dyre commonly used. It isn't until you decode out the bot, however, that the similarities become 
staggering," said Reaves. The TrickBot campaign has been observed using 'webinjects', a malware technique that 
intercepts data before it is encrypted by a website's SSL, to steal information including usernames and passwords. 
So far the campaign has targeted a number of Australian banks including ANZ, NAB and Westpac, echoing the 
activities favoured by the Dyre Trojan. "It is our assessment with strong confidence that there is a clear link between 
Dyre and TrickBot but that there is a considerable new development that has been invested into TrickBot," said 
Reaves. "With moderate confidence, we assess that one or more of the original developers of Dyre is involved with 
TrickBot." The researcher points to similarities between the two Trojans, including a custom cryptor and loader, and 
an updated bot believed to be based on Dyre code. The bot appears to be still in development, which Reaves 
believes is evidence that those responsible are "pushing to rebuild their Cutwail botnet" in preparation for future 
attacks. "It'll be interesting to see if TrickBot can reach or pass its predecessor," said Reaves. In mid-2015 budget 
airline Ryanair lost over $5 million when it was scammed by a Dyre Trojan fraudulent email campaign. [ 1]:

of 26 percent of the airline's sales.As a result, he said Tuesday, Ryanair's forecast for net profits in fiscal 2017 was

Oct 05, 2016( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair is to create more 
than 3,500 new jobs next year as it adds a further 50 planes to its fleet, reports The Independent[1]. The budget 
Irish airline said it planned to take on 2,000 cabin crew, 1,000 pilots and 250 engineers as it continues its 
expansion. However, the carrier did not say how many of the new positions would be based in the UK, commenting 
only that they would be 'spread throughout Ryanair's 84-base European network'.In a July trading statement, 
the company said it would 'pivot growth away from UK airports and focus more on growing at our EU airports over 
the next two years', adding that this would mean cutting capacity on many routes out of London Stansted. 
Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, a vocal supporter of remaining within the EU, said last week that airlines were 
delaying investment because of uncertainty around Brexit. Last month that the UK would be 'screwed' in Brexit 
trade deals. He said then: 'We're being very cautious about the amount of capacity we're allocating to the UK over 
the next two or three years until we get some kind of indication of what Brexit will look like. 'It's not because we're 
annoyed or anything with the UK, but we have much more political certainty in continental Europe than we have in 
the UK while they're all running around trying to work out what Brexit looks like.' The current recruitment drive is 
part of a broader plan that includes boosting plane numbers from 355 to over 500 in five years, with total staff 
numbers increasing by 5,000 over that period.Eddie Wilson, chief people officer at Ryanair, said: '2017 is set to be 
our busiest recruitment year to date, and we are continuing to invest heavily in talent for the future.' Meanwhile, 
traffic figures showed Ryanair increased passenger numbers by 13 per cent year-on-year in September, tp 10.8 
million. The group's load factor - how full its planes are - also improved, moving to 95 per cent last month from 94 
per cent a year earlier. Ryanair also said it expects average fares to drop by between 10 and 12 per cent in the next 
six months. [ 1]: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ryanair-3500-jobs-recruitment-2017-expansion-

Oct 05, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  On Oct 4, 2016, we 
issued an updated research report on JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[1]. The Long Island City, NY-based low-
cost carrier currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating that it will outperform the broader market in the near 
term.We are impressed by the renewable jet fuel purchase agreement between JetBlue Airways and SG Preston 
last month. Under this deal, which is aimed at reducing carbon emissions, JetBlue is expected to purchase over 33 
million gallons of blended fuel per year from SG Preston over a period of 10 years. This deal is by far the largest, 
binding commitment for hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA)-based renewable fuel purchase over a long 
term by an airline company.We are also impressed by the company's bullish guidance for total revenue per 
available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the third quarter. 
The carrier expects RASM for the third quarter to decline 3-4% year over year. This marks an improvement from the 
8.2% decline in the second quarter.We are also positive on the U.S. DOT's decision to grant final approval to eight 
carriers, including JetBlue, to initiate commercial flights to Havana. The approval was gained on the same day the 
first U.S. flight landed in Cuba in more than 50 years. The flight from Fort Lauderdale to Santa Clara was operated 
by JetBlue.Moreover, the carrier has an impressive history with respect to earnings per share. JetBlue Airways 
managed to outperform the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average earnings 
beat of 7.76%. We expect the carrier to perform well in the third quarter as well. In fact, the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for the quarter has increased by 7 cents to 59 cents per share over the last three months.In view of the 
above positives, we believe that JetBlue Airways has significant scope for share price appreciation the near term 
and hence, advice investors to add the stock to their portfolio.Other Stocks to ConsiderApart from JetBlue Airways, 
investors interested in the airlines industry may consider stocks like Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2], GOL Linhas 
GOL[3] and Copa Holdings CPA[4]. While Ryanair and GOL Linhas carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Copa Holdings 
sports a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5].The 
2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate for Copa Holdings has climbed 10 cents to $4.55 per share in the last month.The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has climbed 4 cents to $5.99 per share for Ryanair in the last month.The 
loss estimate for GOL Linhas has narrowed to 11 cents for the third quarter from a loss of $1.60 expected a month 
ago. Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are

Oct 04, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Thomson 
ReutersDave Lutz, head of Exchange Traded Funds at JonesTrading, has a brief overview of what traders are 
talking about before the US market open on Tuesday. In brief: The pound crashed to a 31-year low against the 
dollar as more details of the UK's strategy to leave the European Union emerge. Cable, the nickname for the 
pound/dollar pair, fell below the level it slid to after the referendum in June. 
Global markets are giving up early gains, and US stock futures are well off the highs reached overnight. Crude oil is 
down by less than 1% to $48.42 per barrel ahead of weekly data on inventories. Here's Lutz:  Good Morning! US 
Futures are holding green, but well off overnight highs as the Dollar continues to rally sharply. Over in Europe, 
Markets are surrendering a strong early session, which saw a broad-based advance led by the Banks as Deutsche 
hits a two-week high - Helping the DAX climb 50bp as Frankfurt reopens from holiday. The materials sector is 
holding strong gains tho, offsetting a whack in EU Airlines on RyanAir headers. The FTSE ripping 1.5% higher as 
the Pound collapses. London back through 7,000 at a 17month high led by Banks and Miners. Upbeat overnight in 
Asia, with Japan up almost 1% as the Yen dropped, led by a near 2% jump in the banks - Aussie was flat as the big 
4 banks were under pressure, and Utilities lost 1% - Hang Seng up 50bp, while China was closed for 'Golden Week' 
- India closes up small despite their new Central Bank Governor cutting rates.  Decent bid to Treasuries and Bunds 
this AM, following some strength in JGBs overnight. All the macro focus is on Pound Sterling, which is seeing 31Y 
lows against the Dollar as more details on the Brexit strategy emerge. This angst seems to be weighing on Euro as 
well, propelling the Swiss Franc near 1M highs. Coupled with the Yen getting hit on some overnight data - we have 
the DXY squeezing thru 200dma, causing a headwind for commodities. Metals are all weaker, but notably Gold is 
outperforming - hovering around unchanged. Oil Complex is weaker as Brent beaten away from $50 and WTI down 
1% ahead of API inventories tonight. Gasoline seems to be outperforming tho, perhaps reflecting some angst about 
Hurricane Matthew's track.  Volumes should be muted again, as Rosh Hashanah continues ahead of the Jobs 
Report on Friday. At 8:05, we get our 1st of 2 Fed Speakers - Fed's Lacker (Non-Voter, Hawk) speaks - at 9:45 we 
get the ISM New York, just ahead of the Bank of England Bond-Buying Operation Results at 9:50. We get API 
Inventories tonight at 4:30 (Street at 1.75M overall build, with Gasoline stockpiles adding 550k) - Fed's Evans (Non 
Voter, Dove) speaks at 7:50 - and the VP Debate is at 9pm tonight. We also have the Grant's Conference in NY:

NI Executive agrees multi-million pound funding for City of Derry Airport
NI Executive agrees multi-million pound funding for City of Derry Airport

Sep 16, 2016( Slugger O'Toole: http://www.sluggerotoole.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Announced yesterday was 
the news that the City of Derry Airport, currently owned by Derry City ...rabane District Council, is in line to received 
an as yet unspecified sum (although Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said it was a multi-million pound deal, 
and that it had been signed off). Many will know that the airport runs at a loss to the ratepayers of the council of 
Â£2.145 million per year[1]. Ryanair announced recently[2] that they would be cutting their Derry-Stansted route and 
the Derry-Faro route, and reducing the Derry-Liverpool route to just twice a week. Leaving the beleaguered airport 
with just seven confirmed stable flights in and out per week. Northern Ireland has 3 'major' commercial airports, at a 
rate of 1 airport for every 600,000 citizens or so, England has a ratio of 1 airport to 2.5 million citizens. 
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MLA said,With the future of Derry Airport lies too the future of Derry's economy, 
opportunities for our people and their ability to build a life here. The Executive cannot fumble it[3].Deputy First 
Minister Martin McGuinness MLA said that the funding would allow for future growth for the facility,What we are 
trying to do is reach a stage where City of Derry Airport is sustainable financially [it is] the right thing to do.Looking 
back in to the not-too-distant archives of the Derry Journal (February 27th 1989), we can find a previous Sinn FÃ©in 
MLA passing comment over a similar investment. During a discussion over a Â£300,000 grant from the Ireland Fund 
for the City of Derry Airport (or Eglinton Airport as it was then), a young Sinn FÃ©in Councillor, now-former speaker of 
the assembly, Mitchel McLaughlin said that the money would be better spent on social and cultural amenities for the 
city[4]. Cllr McLaughlin added that Sinn FÃ©in was not and never had been opposed to the concept of a viable local 
airport, he had concerns however that the airport could eventually be proved to be a white elephant Local SDLP 
Councillor Pat Devine said the airport was a necessary part of Derry's development and a sound investment for the 
future.[5] The Derry airport went on to receive Â£10.5 million from the European Regional Development Fund 
between 1989 and 1993 (Over Â£23 million today when adjusted for inflation). Again in 2006, there was roughly â‚¬15 
million (â‚¬17.5 million today when adjusted for inflation) invested from the British and Irish governments into the City 
of Derry Airport, once more with the view of turning its fortunes around and widening its reach. This article from the 
Belfast Telegraph[6] in 2008 talks of the wonderful potential of the North West's airport. Since 2007, the passenger 
figures have dropped by 33.5% and losses are mounting. What was suggested as a potential white elephant all 
those years ago in 1989 is still draining public money but yet still being vaunted as the saviour of the north-west. 
Many politicians, mainly nationalist, talk up the importance of the City of Derry Airport to the whole of Ireland's North 
West between 2014 and 2015, Derry's passenger figures fell by 18% alone, whereas passenger figures went up 
3.2% at Donegal Airport (albeit on much smaller aircraft generally), for that matter - it's only 90 miles from Donegal 
town to Belfast International Airport not a great distance in the grand scheme of things. Then again, the NI 
NI Executive agrees multi-million pound funding for City of Derry Airport
Executive seems to have a new-found love for all types of aviation expenditure[7]. As Mick Fealty points out here, 
'[8]the downsizing of government to just two parties has at least led to some form of action.' But is this a case of 
throwing good money after bad because nobody wants to be the leader who puts the poor thing out of its misery?

Sep 15, 2016( Next Big Future: http://nextbigfuture.com Delivered by Newstex)  Norwegian Air is the world's fastest 
growing airline and it is leading the way in low cost international fares[1] Norwegian is Europe's third largest budget 
carrier after Ryanair and EasyJet. In October, 2015 they announced that an order for 19 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners 
at a price of $5 billion. It will take delivery of the planes between 2017 and 2020, and has an option to order an 
additional 10. They already have one way flights as cheap as $150-200 from the US to Europe.[2] The plan is have 
US to Europe sales with prices as low as $69 one way in 2017 when new 737 Max planes are delivered.

VQGuySTXIcMXk9wbw9gCLcB/s1600/norwegian787s.png787 Dreamliners and updated 777X will transport the 
number of people that used to require a[3] jumbo jet will enable airlines like Norwegian to have multiple flights per 
day on the same route. This will mean they can compete for the international business traveller. This will provide 
better economics for discount international carriers. Norwegian is using about 11 long range Boeing 787 Dreamliner 
planes for their current international flights. They will be adding about 10 Dreamliners each year, which will be used 
to increase the routes and frequency of flights. They will use 737 Max planes to fly from the east coast of the US to 
Europe.By the of 2017, Norwegian will have twice their international fleet of 787s.This could see fairly frequent one 
way West coast US to Europe fares below $150 one way. Currently prices occasionally get below $200 one way.By 
the end of 2018, Norwegian long haul fleet will triple its current size and will likely see fairly frequent one way West 
coast US to Europe fares below $100 one way.Other airlines have tried a low-fare approach on long-haul flights, 
with little success. But Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian's ebullient chief executive,[4] is confident that his unconventional 
approach will allow the airline to offer fares 50 percent cheaper than the competition's.Boeing 787 Dreamliners 
have longer range and can connect secondary international airports like Oakland and Sweden directly with no 
transfers.Direct flights to non-hub airports means existing airlines cannot block out the gates at the hubs. [ 1]:

Transport, Tourism and Sport Shane Ross TD have launched a â‚¬9m promotional campaign, to boost late-season 
travel to Ireland from around the world, with the help of actor Richard E Grant. 
The September to December period usually yields as much as 30% of Ireland's annual overseas tourism business. 
As part of the campaign, Richard E Grant arrived in Dublin to film two new online videos for a promotion with 
Smooth Radio in Britain, which will reach about 5.5m potential holidaymakers. The campaign will highlight the 
festivals and events taking place around the island this autumn and winter - from the Dublin Theatre Festival to the 
Bram Stoker Festival and Culture Night, Lisdoonvarna Matchmaking Festival, Galway International Oyster Festival, 
Belfast International Arts Festival, Sligo Live, Cork Jazz Festival, Wexford Festival Opera and New Year Festival 
(NYF) Dublin. The campaign is being rolled out in Great Britain, North America, Mainland Europe, Australia and 
emerging markets, and will incorporate a focus on city breaks, as well as on attracting visitors to more rural areas 
over the coming months. Highlights of the activity include co-operative promotions with Ryanair, Aer Lingus and 
Stena Line, transatlantic and long-haul airlines like Delta, American and Ethiopian Airlines; online advertising; as 
well as a programme of digital, PR and social media activity. Tourism Ireland CEO Niall Gibbons said: 'We have 
seen very strong growth of almost 13% in overseas visitors to Ireland for the first seven months of 2016. Our 
autumn campaign aims to take advantage of late booking trends in our markets around the world, as there is still 
plenty of business to play for. Many people are opting for shorter holiday breaks and autumn is a good opportunity 
with many world-class festivals and events happening around the island.'

Sep 05, 2016( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  Q: I recently booked a 
trip to Italy through OneTravel.com. My flight was one hour late arriving in Rome. I wasn't concerned because I 
knew that I'd planned plenty of time before my next flight to Palermo. 
I retrieved my luggage and went through customs, then grabbed a bite to eat before heading to the check-in at 
Vueling Airlines. When I got there, an airline representative told me I'd missed my flight. I gave her my confirmed 
booking, and she said that my flight was canceled and I'd been placed on an earlier flight that departed at 9:10 
a.m.I had not been notified and couldn't have accepted the change, since my flight didn't land until 9:15 a.m. 
Vueling would not honor my ticket because I booked through OneTravel and not the airline directly. The 
representative could not offer me another flight for that day and told me to go to Ryanair. I booked a flight with 
Ryanair. The only flight I could get was for the next morning, and the cost of the ticket was more than double the 
original price. I immediately called my hotel in Palermo to cancel my one-night stay, but was told that I was not 
within the 24-hour cancellation period and I would have to pay for the hotel. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital 
Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]I then needed to find a hotel. I was exhausted from the all-night travel and decided that 
the Hilton at the Rome airport was my best option. The only room available was one on the concierge level. When I 
returned from my trip, I called OneTravel.com. It denied ever receiving a call from Vueling and would not claim 
responsibility for the error. I've tried to get in touch with Vueling directly, but have not heard back yet. I would like 
someone to take responsibility for this mistake and to be reimbursed. I've exhausted every avenue and am hoping 
that you can help me. â€” Judy Weidel, Towson, Maryland A: Vueling should have told your travel agency about the 
rescheduled flight, and it should have fixed your itinerary so that your flight to Palermo didn't leave 15 minutes 
before you arrived in Rome. That's an impossible connection, of course.Your online travel agent, OneTravel.com, is 
responsible for monitoring the flight schedules and ensuring that you can reasonably make all of your connections. 
So, while it's regrettable that Vueling didn't inform the agent of the schedule change, that doesn't absolve 
OneTravel of its responsibility. I mean, that's the reason you work with a travel agent (online or offline). You want to 
have someone to help you when something goes wrong, as it did for you.You might have avoided this by contacting 
all of your airlines directly to confirm your flights before leaving. That's always a good idea, even when you're using 
a travel agent. Sometimes, airlines fail to inform their travel agents about a schedule change, and you really don't 
want to miss your flight. You might have appealed OneTravel.com's decision to one of its executives. I list the 
names and numbers of its executives on my consumer-advocacy site: elliott.org/company-contacts/fareportal/[2]. I 
contacted OneTravel.com on your behalf. It apologized for the mix-up and refunded $692. [ 1]:

Sep 02, 2016( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings could 
snap up more Boeing 737s should other carriers shy away from orders amid softening demand, Chief Executive 
Office Michael O'Leary said. Ryanair is interested in sourcing extra single-aisle planes, even though it has 115 
current generation 737-800s due for delivery over the next few years followed by 100 updated 737MAX 200s 
arriving from 2019, and is also exploring a further MAX order.'If additional slots became available in 2017 or 2018 
we'd happily take them,' O'Leary said in an interview in London. 
'If Boeing have more cancellations and all of a sudden instead of having oversold their order book they now have 
unplaced aircraft, I'm sure they'll come back to us.' The additional planes would replace some of Ryanair's older 
737-800s, the CEO said, adding that the carrier struck a similar deal for 15 surplus -800s earlier this decade, taking 
delivery in 2014 and 2015. Boeing doesn't comment on client discussions, spokesman Doug Alder said by email. 
Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]Ryanair is meanwhile continuing talks with Boeing 
over exercising options for 100 more MAX 200s, a higher density upgrade of the 737-800 for which the Dublin-
based company is the launch customer. A final decision on a follow-on order doesn't need to be taken until 2018, 
O'Leary said. With Boeing and Airbus Group each accelerating production of their single-aisle jets to about 60 a 
month by the end of the decade from 42 now, Ryanair could expect to get hefty discounts if deferrals and 
cancellations increase. 'It all depends on the price; if we could get them for free we would take a huge amount,' 
O'Leary quipped. [ 1]: http://www.seattletimes.com/subscribe/signup/?subsource=promo

Aug 29, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Thomson 
ReutersA prototype Mitsubishi Regional Jet, Japan's first homegrown airliner in more than 50 years, was forced to 
abort two flights to the US over the weekend. In separate statements posted [1]on the company's website, 
Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation attributed both aborted flights to issues with the plane's air conditioning[2] or "air 
management" system. It is unclear the exact nature of the system failure. 
According to the Japan Times[3], the first attempted flight lasted just one hour before the aircraft returning to the 
company's home base in Nagoya. "We will decide the date to resume the ferry flight based on the results of 
inspection," Mitsubishi wrote in a statement following the second failed flight.  The MRJ made its first flight last 
November after three years of delays.  With the capacity to hold 80 to 90 passengers, the MRJ will enter an 
increasing crowed regional jet market when it enters service in 2018. The MRJ is expected to join China's ARJ21[4] 
and Russia's Sukhoi Superjet in a market currently dominated by Bombardier and Embraer[5].  According to the 
Mitsubishi, the MRJ's new Pratt ...itney engines and advanced aerodynamics[6] return 20% better fuel economy 
than regional jet currently on the market. Mitsubishi currently has more 220 orders for its regional jet.NOW WATCH:

Aug 18, 2016( BANG ShowBiz: http://www.bangshowbiz.com Delivered by Newstex)  Lily Allen has started writing a 
book.The 'Smile' singer has been inspired to take on the written word after reading American writer-and-director 
Nora Ephron's collection of self-help essays 'I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a 
Woman'.Released in 2006, the tome sees the 'When Harry Met Sally' screenwriter share nuggets of wisdom she 
has accumulated throughout her life, such as "never marry a man you wouldn't want to be divorced from" and 
"when your children are teenagers, it's important to have a dog so that someone in the house is happy to see 
you".And Lily, 31, is now aiming to create her own guide to life based on her own experiences. Taking to Twitter on 
Wednesday (08.17.16), she revealed: "I read Nora Ephrons 'I feel bad about my neck' today. 
It inspired me to start writing a book, I've been writing solidly for 3hrs #eurekamoment (sic)"The pop star is just at 
the start of a family holiday in Italy with her two daughters, Ethel, four, and three-year-old Marnie - her kids with her 
estranged husband Sam Cooper.So far Lily has been busy looking after her girls and has had no more time to write 
but her mother Alison Owen and Ethel and Marnie's cousins are flying out to join them on Thursday (08.18.16) 
which may mean she will get a chance to continue with the project.In other tweets, she said: "When you have 
children, you forget to do things like wax your legs and have pedicures before you go on holiday ... Actually when 
you have children and you travel with them, it's not really a holiday ... Grandma and feral cousins arrive today 
though, there is hope (sic)"The holiday began with in-air stress for Lily as one of her young daughters got air 
sickness and the songwriter had to catch the vomit in her cupped hands because Ryanair - who she was travelling 
with - no longer provide sick bags.In Twitter posts, she shared: "Dear @Ryanair please can you reintroduce sick 
bags. I just cupped my hands for my child to vomit into ... And then carried it all the way to the loo. Also, no soap so 
had to borrow some anti-bac off of another passenger. (sic)"

Aug 10, 2016( The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Few things are more 
stressful than trying to catch a flight when you're running late. But what lengths would you go to make it to the 
gate?One passenger pushed the limits while trying to catch a Ryanair flight[1] on Friday to the Canary Islands from 
Madrid-Barajas Airport in Spain.As seen in the below video, recorded by airport employees, the passenger, with two 
carry-on bags in tow, jumps off the already-detached jetway onto the tarmac, then bolts down the runway toward a 
plane. 'The passenger had reached the gate with his boarding pass[2] after clearing security,' an airport spokesman 
The Guardian. 'He broke through a fire escape, the doors opened and he got out that way.' 
https://www.facebook.com/330888923603874/videos/1485118684847553/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 
In 
a 
symbolic win for late people everywhere, the man eventually caught his plane and was actually allowed on board, 
despite the fact that he set off airport alarms[3], which alerted the airport's Civil Guard, after breaking through the 
fire escape.The video of his chase was uploaded to the CC.OO. Ryanair and Lesma Handling Facebook page[4], 
which reportedly represents the Madrid Airport Workers Union[5], according to CNN.'This particular passenger was 
missing a Ryanair's flight[6] and, unbelievably, skipped several security protocols,' the translated Facebook post 
reads. 'We're talking about level 4 security protocols!'The passenger was was detained by authorities[7] once the 
plane landed on the island of Gran Canaria, CNN reported.A spokesman for Ryanair told The Associated Press that 
the incident is a case of airport security breach and, as such, is the responsibility of the Madrid airport police[8]. A 
spokesman for the Madrid airport said that the man had 'no terrorist motivations[9]' and 'was never suspected of 
being a terrorist.'Although local police would not release the passenger's identity to the AP, they said he would likely 
face fines for his stunt[10]. Authorities released the man after questioning him at Gran Canaria, but a spokeswoman 
for the airport's Civil Guard said he would still face punishment[11].Hey guy: Maybe next time, try getting to the 
airport

Sorbis/ShutterstockAs soon as the word "cheap" is attached to the word "airline," people get nervous. It's 
understandable â€” America's budget airline companies tend to get horrible reviews[1] for everything from last-
minute cancellations to relentless nickle-and-diming. So when I tell friends and relatives that I regularly fly cheap 
airlines when I travel around Europe, I am prepared for their immediate concern. 
"What do you mean that your round-trip flight from Edinburgh to Rome only cost you $100?" they ask, terrified at 
the thought of all of the shortcuts the airline must be making to keep prices so low. "Is that even safe?"  In all of my 
experiences flying with low-cost European providers â€” notably, Ryanair and EasyJet â€” I have (usually) been 
pleasantly surprised. Here are some of the things that shocked me the most. Many international European flights 
cost less than domestic US flights. Cardinal arrows/ShutterstockThe distance from New York to Miami is about the 
same as the distance from London to Madrid, but, in my experience, tickets for the latter trip on Europe's budget 
airlines will almost always be cheaper. For comparison's sake, I looked up round-trip flights to both places on the 
same dates in August. According to my searches on Google Flights, the trip from New York to Miami cost 
around $230 at the cheapest, while the flight from London to Madrid was only $121 â€” almost half the price. The 
difference in airfare makes even less sense when you think of the fact that London and Madrid are in two different 
countries, while New York and Miami are both in the US.Europe's cheap airlines aren't just for the budget-
conscious.You really see a diverse crowd on Ryanair and Easyjet planes â€” I was surprised to notice a fair amount 
of well-dressed businessmen and families among the groups of traveling students that I was anticipating. I guess 
that if the flights are reliable and cheap, why would you go with anyone else?They're much more reliable than I 
anticipated. kaohanui/ShutterstockI've taken more than 10 trips with budget European airlines, and I can confidently 
say that I have not run into a single delay or cancellation. I have always arrived at my destinations with spectacular 
punctuality, which is pretty impressive. Of course, unexpected situations do ariseâ€” Ryanair's cancellation 
policy[2] allows you to change flights up to 4 hours before flight departure time (with a pretty standard fee that 
varies depending on the circumstances), and a cancellation or significant delay on their part guarantees the 
passenger a full refund. So far, though, I've gotten pretty lucky, and haven't had to deal with any travel hangups that 
weren't my own fault. When I have missed an occasional flight or had to change plans, Ryanair and EasyJet staff 
have always been helpful and attentive.  See the rest of the story at Business Insider[3] See Also: This new floating

Jul 27, 2016( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  KUALA LUMPUR, 
Malaysia (AP) â€” Malaysia Airlines said Wednesday it has agreed to buy up to 50 Boeing Max planes in a deal 
worth $2.75 billion as part of its fleet renewal and said it hopes to relist on the stock exchange by 2019. The airline's 
new CEO, Peter Bellew, said the deal included 25 firm orders, worth $2.75 billion, and the right to purchase another 
25 jets, with deliveries to start in 2019. Airlines usually get a discount from aircraft list prices.It marked the first 
major purchase after the ailing national carrier was taken private after years of financial losses and further hit by two 
air disasters in 2014 â€” the disappearance of Flight 370 and the loss of another plane shot down over Ukraine. The 
airline is undergoing a $1.56 billion overhaul that included cutting 6,000 jobs and axing unprofitable routes.Most

$1 for 4 weeks.[1]Bellew, Ryanair's former director of flight operations, took over July 1 from Christoph Mueller, a 
turnaround veteran who recently resigned abruptly due to personal reasons. Part of the management team under 
Mueller, who was hired last year, Bellew said the carrier is on track to become profitable by 2018 and that it aims to 
relist on the local bourse by March 2019. The new 737 Max jets will be a 'game changer' for the airline with sharply 
lower costs and greater efficiency, cutting fuel cost as much as 15 percent, he said. The planes will be used for 
routes to growth markets in China, India, Pakistan and South Korea, and their purchase will be financed using loans 
and internal funds. Bellew said the deal will not affect the turnaround program and that it made more economic 
sense to buy rather than lease the planes. 'We will have a lot more to do in the next five quarters to make sure the 
airline gets back on track but we are there at the moment,' Bellew said, 'Malaysia Airlines is now on a path to 
growth across the ASEAN region. This new aircraft order will set the stage for our continued recovery and success 
into the next decade,' he added.Late last week, officials of the three countries searching for the disappeared Flight 
370 aircraft said the operation will be suspended once the current search area in the Indian Ocean has been 
completely scoured. [ 1]: http://www.seattletimes.com/subscribe/signup/?subsource=promo

Jul 25, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) Irish airline Ryanair has 
reported a decent rise in first-quarter profits not least due to growing traffic and reduced fuel costs. But future 
earnings look set to be impacted by the aftermath of the UK's Brexit vote. 
Europe's No. 1 budget carrier on Monday reported a 4-percent rise in its first-quarter profit to 256 million euros 
($280 million). "This modest increase in Q1 profit is in line with previous guidance," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary 
said in a statement. "Ongoing market volatility arising from terrorist events and repeated strikes particularly in 
France weakened fares on close-in bookings and caused almost 1,000 flight cancellations." Ryanair said its Q1 
traffic increased by 11 percent, while average fares fell by 10 percent in the same quarter. Looking to strengthen 
EU business But the carrier was able to offset lower fares as unit costs dropped by 9 percent and fuel costs fell by 
42 million euros to 518 million euros. The Irish airline said the recent UK vote to leave the European Union was 
"both a surprise and a disappointment." It added it expected the result of the vote to lead to a protracted period of 
political and economic uncertainty in both the UK and the EU. In the near term, Ryanair said it would brace itself for 
a weaker pound and downward pressure on fares until the end of 2017 at least. The airline added it would pivot its 
growth away from UK airports and shift more of its operations to Ryanair's EU hubs over the next two years. hg/sri

Jul 21, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) Unease over the Nice 
attack and an attempted coup in Turkey has weighed heavily on the profit forecasts of European airlines, which 
were already reeling from the turbulence that followed the Brexit vote. Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa 
downgraded its core earnings forecast for this year on Thursday, saying they would be lower than last year's 1.8 
billion euros ($2 billion). Although Luftansa did not specify how much less it expected to earn, analysts from Credit 
Suisse predicted Lufthansa's profit would shrink to 1.5 billion euros. 
The company cited increasing political and economic uncertainty since the end of the first quarter that was bringing 
bookings down. Tour groups staying home "We're missing out on advanced bookings for intercontinental flights, like 
by tour groups from Asia," a spokesperson from Lufthansa said. While Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr expressed 
hope at the beginning of the month that tourists would maybe make long-haul bookings within a more short-term 
timeframe and pay higher prices, that hasn't happened. "A complete recovery is a development that the board no 
longer considers probable," Lufthansa said in a statement. The German airline has also scaled back a target to 
increase capacity by 6 percent to 5.4 percent. Still, it has managed to increase its half-year operating profits by 13 
percent to 529 million euros. Lufthansa shares nosedived 7.5 percent on Thursday on the news of the downgraded 
forecast. But it wasn't the only carrier that suffered at the stock exchanges - British budget airline EasyJet saw its 
own shares fall 6 percent after it said it would not be able to release an earnings forecast. Its share price has lost a 
third of its value since the Brexit vote last June 23. EasyJet unable to release proft outlook "More recently currency, 
volatility as a result of the U.K.'s referendum decision to leave the EU as well as the recent events in Turkey and 
Nice continue to impact consumer confidence," EasyJet CEO Carolyn McCall said in a statement. The events in 
Nice and Turkey would affect its fourth quarter reporting, but EasyJet did not say by how much. Analysts expect 
EasyJet's pretax profit for the fiscal year ending on Sept 30 to decline by 14 percent to 592 million pounds (710 
million euros, $782 million). The Brexit vote has caused the British sterling pound to fall 10 percent, which makes 
travel abroad more expensive for Britons, who are EasyJet's most important target market. Other commercial 
airlines in Europe are also anticipating pain amid global uncertainty. EasyJet's chief competitor, Irish budget carrier 
Ryanair, is still expecting 13 percent profit growth for the fiscal year until March 2017. It carries a lot less risk to its 
profits than EasyJet, since Ireland is part of the EU. But Ryanair too, has seen its shares slump 17 percent since 
the Brexit vote. jd/cjc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)

Jul 20, 2016( ConversionXL: http://conversionxl.com/blog Delivered by Newstex) If you're a budget brand, there's 
nothing wrong with a website that looks kinda cheap. But if you're selling expensive watches or clothes? Well, that's 
not the message you want to be sending.Of course, it's all about context. Aligning design elements to your brand 
and business goals is important, and there are certain elements that make a site look more expensive/luxurious or 
cheap.What Makes a Website Look Expensive?
A beautiful website[1] tends to look more expensive. Just like with attractive people, an attractive website seems to 
create a Halo Effect[2], where people will judge the product quality, customer service, and other things higher. But 
what does it really mean to have an attractive website? That's pretty subjective, isn't it? Well, yes and no. There are 
certain qualities that luxurious brands tend to use, and there are certain design elements that people perceive as 
more luxurious. The resounding design element that leads people to believe a site is more prestigious is 
simplicity[3].Simplicity and a Luxurious ExperienceWe recently published an academic insight[4] that explored 
which design elements lead people to believe a website is more luxurious. This study analyzed user reactions to 78 
watch websites and 81 car websites, and it looked purely at design elements as differentiators. Things like: Mean 
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Mean HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) Number of colors Dominant color Amount of white 
space Number of products While the study only looked at two product types (watches and cars), it found that a few 
traits were consistent in creating the perception of prestige. If you're looking to create the perception of luxury on 
your site, use lots of white space, keep a low number of products on display, and use fewer colorsâ€¦And using 
colors that weren't too bright correlated with a higher perceived price. There's something about clutter and bright 
colors that screams 'I'm cheap' (as RyanAir knows):Image Source[5] Don't Forget MobileIntuitively, mobile seems 
like a casual browsing medium, so you wouldn't think that those browsing on mobile would purchase, say, a luxury 
watch or car. True or not, it's silly to ignore the mobile experience if you're a luxury brand. Check out these data 
points: According to Think With Google[6], Luxury car price searches grew nearly 90% on mobile. They also found 
that[7] 79% of luxury auto buyers indicated they used a smartphone during their research process. So no matter 
where customers eventually buy a Rolex or a Porsche, they probably did some preliminary research on their phone. 
Since our academic insight (above) didn't explicitly research mobile, we can't fully extrapolate the findings, but we 
can assume some of the basic design principles still apply (minimal color, etc.) For example, A. Lange ...hne's 
mobile site keeps the simple elegance that its desktop site has. Only one product displayed, few colors, lots of white 
spaceâ€¦Other than that, it's most important to make sure your mobile site is usable and that you invest in a great 
mobile experience. Many think they're doing this, but research shows otherwise (about a third of luxury brands[8] 
are said not to be optimized for mobile). You can read more on mobile optimization here[9]. While these design 
How to Create a 'Luxurious' User Experience (and Avoid Looking 'Cheap')
elements are good heuristics if you want to look expensive, it's also helpful to avoid elements that explicitly make 
your site look cheap.What Makes a Website Look Cheap?While creating a perception of luxury seems largely to be 
a brand decision, avoiding the perception that you're cheap has much more to do with usability and, in general, the 
user experience. Anyone can optimize their site to avoid looking cheap and benefit from it. Note also that most of 
what constitutes 'cheap' design is pretty similar to what constitutes untrustworthiness (the most important factor[10] 
in affecting distrust, after all, is visual design[11]). We've written a lot on conversion credibility killers[12], so think 
about 'cheap' design elements with the same heuristics.TypographyIf someone says that typography is a top 5 most 
impactful A/B test to run, you probably shouldn't listen. However, typography clearly (and empirically) has an effect 
on brand perception as well as recall[13]. Studies have also shown different fonts have strong effects on 
trustworthiness (comic sans caused users to disregard a NYT article[14], and in some users, it even caused 
contempt). One expert even said[15], 'Web design is ninety-five percent typography.' The difficulty in discussing 
typography, however, is that there isn't a single right answer. Of course, it first needs to be readable[16], but then it 
also needs to accurately reflect your brand. Here's how Tommy Walker put it in a previous ConversionXL 
article[17]:Tommy Walker: 'The reality of the situation is, asking about 'the best typeface' is going to be about as 
fruitful as asking 'what color converts the best?[18]' It's all subjective, depends on your target market[19], the story 
you're telling ...e emotions you're trying to evoke. Looking at the the big 50 research from Smashing shows us 
'other' fonts are being used more and more, because they're a better reflection of the brand's characteristics and 
personality. The question you have to ask is if the typeface you're using accurately reflects you? It's a difficult 
question to answer, but could make all the difference in the world to your customers.' Make sure your typography is 
working with your ideal branding, not against it. (Image Source[20]) Stock Photos and Other InauthenticityStock 
photos tend to be a credibility killer, and when done really poorly, they make your site look cheap. Stock photos, in 
general, aren't a problem. You can certainly find good quality stock photos and fit them to your purpose. But the 
problem is, if you're trying to look like a luxury brand, you can't use photos that are common, prevalent, or 
overused. It makes your brand look like those three adjectives - the opposite of your goal. Remember the 
Everywhere Girl? In 1996, Jennifer Anderson posed for a stock photo shoot shortly after graduating college. At the 
time, companies would subscribe to a service ...ceive their stock photos on a CD-ROM. Trouble was, the 
companies receiving the CD's didn't have an easy way to verify who else was using the photo, and the license for 
the images was not exclusive - meaning anyone could use them. Within a few years, Jennifer became the face of 
college girls in what seemed to be every marketing campaign. The most notorious faux pas was in 2004, when PC 
competitors Dell ...teway used photos from the same photo shoot in their 'Back to School' promotional material.As 
MassImpressions put it[21], 'Try to avoid stock photos wherever possibleâ€¦There are countless professional 
photographers out there, many of whom are absolutely crying out for somewhere to showcase their work in 
exchange for a credit on the website or a link back to their portfolio. And they deserve your support - the way things 
are going online, we need to use 'em or we'll lose 'em.'UsabilityMany luxury sites make the mistake[22] of throwing 
usability best practices out the window because they are 'stifling their creativity.' That's not a good idea. According 
to Information-foraging theory[23], people 'behave on the web like animals in the wild: they assess the perceived 
value of a new foraging patch against the perceived cost (effort) of obtaining that food.' In other words, it's 
motivation vs. friction. Any additional friction lowers the chance that users will take the action; beyond that, friction 
actually produces a negative reaction to the brand (a reverse-Halo-effect[24]). Here's how Aurora Bedford from 
NN/g explained it[25]â€¦Aurora Bedford: 'By improving a site's usability, we reduce the interaction cost, and thus 
increase the expected utility. But remember that the perception of the interaction cost (that is, users' assessment of 
how hard it will be to use the site) is almost as important as the actual interaction cost (i.e., the real effort required to 
use the site): the perceived cost drives the initial assessment of the site's expected utility. Thus, to convince people 
to stick around and explore deeper into the website, it is important to accurately reflect the quality of the 
organization and convey ease of use. If, at a glance, users do not believe that the site is worth their time and effort, 
then they have little reason to stay.' Tons of Popups and DistractionsWhile data may, in aggregate, tell you that 
popups work well[26], if you run a luxury brand, nothing says cheap like 13 popups in your face before you can 
even read the value proposition. I landed on The Luxe Nomad[27], a site supposedly for luxury travel 
accommodations, and within seconds was bombarded with like 5 popups (one large overlay and a few more in the 
background). They were also bright orange, not doing any favors to the attempted 'luxury brand':But when I went on 
A. Lange ...hne's[28] site to buy a watch (I wish), all I got was a nice, minimalist design with no distractions.It's not 
enough to say that 'pop-ups are bad.' I'm sure there are ways to make them fit with a luxury brand (seems Bounce 
X[29] does this well). It's more about avoiding a cluttered and sleazy looking user experience. When a website is 
How to Create a 'Luxurious' User Experience (and Avoid Looking 'Cheap')
too cluttered, it conveys a certain cheapness. Here's how Aurora Bedford from NN/g put it[30]:Aurora Bedford: 'In 
the physical world, we often assess the value of a shop based on the storefront: displaying many items in the front 
window may signal cheaper prices and lower quality, while a few products in a large window may convey exclusivity 
and higher value. (This assessment is related to people's scarcity bias: many items crammed into a display appear 
easy to obtain, while a single object seems more elusive.)â€¦ â€¦Just as with the physical storefront, a cluttered 
webpage lowers the perceived value of the organization. Clutter and disorganized content suggest a lack of 
attention to detail, or an inability to distill information into a meaningful summary that, due to the halo effect, people 
assume reflects the overall character of the business.' Image Source[31] AbundanceScarcity works[32] (and not 
just for narcissists[33]). Part of prestige is the idea that you're one of the few invited to the club. If everyone has a 
Rolex, then it becomes mundane. I mentioned a study above that said smaller product offerings correlated with 
higher perceived price, but when something is limited, either in quantity or simply because of its 'prestige 
pricing[34],' it becomes perceived as more valuable. I think Sid Bharath put it really well[35] in a Crazy Egg article 
from 2014:Sid Bharath: 'In 1962, Ferrari manufactured a series of sports cars called the Ferrari 250 GTO and sold 
them for $18,000 each. Only 39 were manufactured in total. In 2004, a young man put the finishing touches on a 
website he was working on from his dorm room at Harvard. It was a site where people could connect with each 
other online, but only Harvard students could access it. Today, one of those cars is worth over $50 million, making it 
the most expensive car in the world. And that website is worth more than $150 billion, making it one of the most 
valuable companies in the world. When access to something is restricted, by being scarce or exclusive, the 
perceived value and demand for it increases. We always crave what we can't have. We want to be the only one to 
own that rare item, or get admitted to that private club. And we're willing to pay big.'By capping their production 
output[36], Ferrari makes it more valuable to own one of the limited vehicles it makes. And you know that luxury 
fashion retailers[37] have mastered this 'limited edition' scarcity tactic.Let Design Match Your ObjectivesSo to get 
people to buy, do you need to raise prices[38], offer fewer products, limit your colors, etc.? No. Let your objectives 
lead your design. There was a good discussion in the comments section of a previous article, Beauty Pays: 
Beautiful Websites (and People) Get Better Results[39], about whether or not beautiful design actually works better. 
The answer? It depends. As a commenter put it, 'Imho design should support your objectives and help converting 
your audience. However this does NOT mean that your design has to be beautiful (whatever that may be).' He went 
on to mention RyanAir, eBay, and Amazon as examples of non-beautiful design. Peep agreed with this:Peep Laja: 
'â€¦'Design should support your objectives and help converting your audience' - I agree 100%! And great design 
enables you to do it. I see that in my line of work day in and day out. You change nothing but design, and 
conversions go up. Of course, the design has to be conversion optimized. Ryanair's brand is 'cheap' and they do an 
excellent job of communicating with their website. It's a brand thing.'Aurora Bedford from NN/g[40] also emphasized 
the focus on brand and objectives to guide your designâ€¦Aurora Bedford: 'The most important thing to remember is 
that the initial perception of the site must actually match the business â€” not every website needs to strive to create 
a perception of luxury and sophistication, as what is valuable to one user may be at complete odds with another. 
The 'budget' impression communicated by Tigerair's bright colors and dense presentation of deals works well 
because the company's value proposition is low price, not exceptional service. If a flight with Tigerair was more 
expensive than a seemingly higher-end Singapore Airlines' flight, for example, the user would likely not purchase 
because such a disparity does not match the expectation set up by the website design. On the other hand, users 
who care about hospitality and service will prefer the sophisticated design of Singapore Airlines to the cute graphics 
of Tigerair.' ConclusionIf you want to look like an expensive luxury brand, here are some best practices that 
correlate (not cause, by the way[41]) with a higher perceived price point/value: Use fewer colors Use fewer bright 
colors Use more white space Display a smaller product offering Clean up the clutter and cheap tactics If you don't 
want to look like an expensive luxury brand, well, then don't feel like you need to march in lock-step behind these 
heuristics. Instead, align your objectives and strategy with your design, and find what works best for your own 
business case. Feature image source[42] The post How to Create a 'Luxurious' User Experience (and Avoid

Bear of the Day: Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY)

Jul 19, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) It hasn't been a great time 
to be in the airline business as investors continue to worry about terrorism and Zika. Many anticipate that both of 
these issues will hit airline stocks hard, while increased competition will make dealing with any slowdown that much 
more difficult. But even beyond those issues, some airline stocks need to worry about political problems too. 
Take Ryanair ( RYAAY[1]) for example. The Ireland-based airline has a significant portion of its business in the UK, 
as well as flights that transit between the UK and the rest of Europe. In fact, close to a third of its traffic is done in 
the UK so any big changes are sure to impact them more than others. RYAAY in Focus Thanks to this 
uncertaintyâ€”as well as the broad concerns for airlinesâ€”RYAAY has greatly underperformed markets over the past 
three months, losing more than 15% in the time frame. The stock has actually managed to underperform even the 
British ETF (EWU[2]) over the past month (where Brexit should have made the biggest dent) signaling just how bad 
things have gotten for Ryanair, and what a big impact recent events could have on their business model. Analysts 
have also begun to move their expectations lower for RYAAY shares, as the current year and next year estimates 
have both come down in the past two months. Plus, the most recent consensus estimate for the current year is 
roughly 3.3% lower than the full Zacks Consensus Estimate so it is clear that more recent estimates are sharply 
lower. No wonder RYAAY has recently fallen into 'strong sell' territory and is a Zacks Rank #5 stock. This is a 
ranking we only give to the bottom five percent of all stocks out there, so it isn't an area you want to be in by any 
means. This is especially true when earnings are coming up, as the stock has a horrific track record when it comes 
to managing analyst expectations. It has missed in three of the last four reports including a nearly 17% miss in the 
most recent report, so not exactly a good run for this company at earnings season. RYANAIR HLDGS Price and 
EPS Surprise https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price-eps-surprise RYANAIR HLDGS Price and EPS 
Surprise[3] | RYANAIR HLDGS Quote[4] If that wasn't enoughâ€¦ Investors should also note that despite a PE below 
12, Ryanair has a 'D' Grade for value, putting it into the bottom 40% of all stocks from this look. This is largely 
based on its weak metrics for both P/B and P/s, while its earnings yield is also less than the industry average too. 
And while RYAAY is suffering from the broad European malaise more than most, it is important to remember that 
the industry at large is in a bit of a rough spot. The industry rank is in the bottom 10% overall, so there are few 
industries worse off from a broad Zacks Rank perspective these days. Other Choices While the space may be 
looking poor right now, there is actually a bit of hope left. In fact, of the 26 stocks in the group, three have ranks of 
#2 or better. The lone #1 ranked stock right now is Cathay Pacific Air (CPCAY[5]) and it was just upgraded to 
'strong buy' territory within the last week. Additionally, this stock has a Value Grade of 'A', making it the polar 
opposite of Ryanair on both of these crucial fronts. So, until the Brexit worries get sorted out or until the European

travel market becomes a little more favorable to investors, it seems as though investors should look to Cathay 
Pacific over Ryanair for now. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can

Jul 19, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate Release 
Chicago, IL - July 19, 2016 - Zacks Equity Research[1] highlightsBeacon Roofing Supply (BECN[2]) as the Bull of 
the Day and Ryanair (RYAAY[3]) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on 
Netflix (NFLX[4]) and IBM ( IBM[5]). Here is a synopsis of all four stocks: Bull of the Day[6] : Sometimes you have to 
go old school to find profits. Sure the market is flying to all-time highs and people are running around playing 
augmented reality games on their mobile phones but don't lose sight of traditional companies making money. 
Today's Bull of the Day is a company that's invested in putting a roof over your head. 
Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN[7]) is one of the largest distributors of residential and non-residential roofing 
materials in the United States and Canada. It also distributes other complementary exterior building products. It 
operate in several states and three Canadian provinces and is a leading distributor of roofing materials in key 
metropolitan markets in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States and in 
Eastern Canada. The company is lighting up the charts here with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to go along with 
Growth and Momentum Style Scores of A. Add to that a Value Style score of B and you have a VGM Composite of 
A as well. That must mean that analysts are very bullish in the short term on BECN. If you dig down into the details 
you'll find that two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, next quarter, current 
year and next year. The bullish sentiment is enough to hike up this year's Zacks Consensus Estimate from $1.92 to 
$2.13 for the current year and push up next year's number from $2.37 to $2.51. Bear of the Day[8]: It hasn't been a 
great time to be in the airline business as investors continue to worry about terrorism and Zika. Many anticipate that 
both of these issues will hit airline stocks hard, while increased competition will make dealing with any slowdown 
that much more difficult. But even beyond those issues, some airline stocks need to worry about political problems 
too. Take Ryanair ( RYAAY[9]) for example. The Ireland-based airline has a significant portion of its business in the 
UK, as well as flights that transit between the UK and the rest of Europe. In fact, close to a third of its traffic is done 
in the UK so any big changes are sure to impact them more than others. RYAAY in Focus Thanks to this 
uncertaintyâ€”as well as the broad concerns for airlinesâ€”RYAAY has greatly underperformed markets over the past 
three months, losing more than 15% in the time frame. The stock has actually managed to underperform even the 
British ETF over the past month (where Brexit should have made the biggest dent) signaling just how bad things 
have gotten for Ryanair, and what a big impact recent events could have on their business model. Analysts have 
also begun to move their expectations lower for RYAAY shares, as the current year and next year estimates have 
both come down in the past two months. Plus, the most recent consensus estimate for the current year is roughly 
Beacon Roofing Supply, Ryanair , Netflix and IBM highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day
3.3% lower than the full Zacks Consensus Estimate so it is clear that more recent estimates are sharply lower. No 
wonder RYAAY has recently fallen into 'strong sell' territory and is a Zacks Rank #5 stock. This is a ranking we only 
give to the bottom five percent of all stocks out there, so it isn't an area you want to be in by any means. This is 
especially true when earnings are coming up, as the stock has a horrific track record when it comes to managing 
analyst expectations. It has missed in three of the last four reports including a nearly 17% miss in the most recent 
report, so not exactly a good run for this company at earnings season. Additional content: Netflix, IBM Post Widely 
Different Q2 Earnings Upon Monday's market close, two big names have reported earnings results for fiscal Q2 
2016: premier streaming content firm Netflix (NFLX[10]) and overall tech behemoth IBM ( IBM[11]) posted quite 
varied fiscal Q2 numbers. While IBM modestly topped expectations, Netflix looks to have wildly over-promised its 
Q2 subscriber numbers. Netflix has topped the consensus for Q2 earnings, but every other metric listed in the 
company's report after the bell today came in much lower than expected. Revenues of $1966 million missed the 
Zacks consensus of $2110 million. Total net subscriber adds of 160K was far beneath the 532K the company 
projected. International subscriber numbers came in 600K lower than anticipated. EPS guidance for Q3 is also 
lower than expectations: 5 cents per share, compared with 7 cents in the previous consensus. Immediately in after-
hours trading, NFLX shares have plummeted more than 15%. Netflix shares had already sunk more than 13% year-
to-date. The company has chalked up much of the disappointment to the "ungrandfathering" of subscribers, 
amounting to price hike churn. Netflix expects Q3 subscriber numbers to double next quarter, but plenty of investors 
will think twice after such a profound miss in such a key business element. Further, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings 
remarked that the regional sales climate in China -- understood to be the next major frontier for Netflix's growth -- 
was becoming "more challenging," and that the company will "continue to explore options." Hastings pointed out the 
company did not feel it has lost market share to competitors like Amazon Prime and Hulu which resulted in the 
company's poor performance. IBM posted an earnings and sales beat today after the bell, bringing in $2.95 per 
share on $20.24 billion in revenues, easily topping the $2.87 per share and $20.08 billion of the Zacks Consensus 
Estimates. This mark's IBM's 4th straight positive earnings surprise on impressive Cognitive Solutions (Watson) 
results -- $4.7 billion, better than the $4.5 billion analysts had expected. Also, the annual run rate for IBM's cloud-
based solutions is up $2.2 billion from the year-ago quarter, to $6.7 billion. Get today's Zacks #1 Stock of the Day

Jul 18, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Low-cost carrier JetBlue 
Airways Corp. JBLU[1] witnessed an improvement in air traffic in the month of June. Traffic - measured in revenue 
passenger miles (RPMs) - was 3.95 billion, up 11.6% from 3.54 billion recorded a year ago. 
On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) soared to 10.5% to 4.58 
billion.Load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers increased to 86.2% while it was 85.3% in Jun 2015. 
The increase in the metric was due to traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion. JetBlue's preliminary revenue 
per available seat mile (RASM) in the month dropped roughly 4.5% on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, for the first 
six months of 2016, JetBlue generated RPMs of 22.52 billion (up 12.1% year over year) and ASMs of 26.62 billion 
(up 12.6%). However, the load factor declined 30 basis points to 84.9%.Routes ExpansionJetBlue is one of the 
best-performing budget airlines in the U.S. The company's focus on route expansion in order to improve operations 
in its service areas by driving passenger count along with boosting supplementary revenues augurs well. 
Additionally being chosen as one of the many US based carriers by the U.S. Department of Transportation to 
operate scheduled flights to Cuba is an immensely stimulating news for JetBlue.Moreover, in sync with its 
customer-centric efforts, JetBlue recently declared that it would cover TSA Pre enrollment cost for its most frequent 
fliers or the Mosaic TrueBlue members. The airline has introduced this limited time offer to cut down waiting time at 
TSA screening checkpoints.Citing pressures due to lower demand for travelling in the wake of numerous terrorist 
attacks, most airline companies have been trimming their outlook for the year. The list includes Delta Airlines 
DAL[2], European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] and American Airlines Group AAL[4].JetBlue

Jul 14, 2016( IT Pro: http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex) Ryanair is using Qlik software to help it fill more 
flights and improve the different services it offers to customers. The Irish airline's BI team is using QlikView and Qlik 
Sense to gain insight into the business's operations and to inform business decisions. 
Shane Finnegan, senior BI developer at Ryanair, said that analytics experts at the airline wanted to consume their 
data in different ways to how end users wished to do so. 'We wanted a platform that would allow us to meet these 
differing needs. Qlik offered two complementary products to do just that - QlikView and Qlik Sense. QlikView can be 
used by staff who have in-depth analytical roles, such as for those who work in finance or marketing,' he said. 'Qlik 
Sense has then been overlaid on top of this so that staff in more time-sensitive departments - say in Ground Ops or 
Flight Ops - can get quick and easy-to-digest data visualisations, showing instantly what's going on, where there's 
an issue, quantify the issue, and address the issue.' The airline will also look to use Qlik in the future to improve its 
in-flight retail offering, as well as helping to optimise the supply chain by understanding the anticipated passenger 
mix on a given flight and matching this with an appropriate range of products and sufficient stock for the flight. 'With 
Qlik, we're building a complete overview of what's going on across the business and it is playing a major role in the 
way we are evolving the services we offer to customers,' said Finnegan. 'Ultimately, we want to find the best ways 
to make our customers happy onboard, while being able to offer them the lowest fares on the market - and Qlik 
gives us the foundation to make educated decisions which will make that notion a reality.'

Jul 14, 2016( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex) Malu 
Dreyer, state premier for Rhineland-Palatinate, will stay in office despite bungling a major deal to sell the state's 
major airport to Chinese investors. The leader of government in Germany's state of Rhineland-Palatinate narrowly 
won a no-confidence vote on Thursday. 
With 49 votes against her and 52 in favor, Social Democrat (SPD) Malu Dreyer managed to stay in office despite 
vehement criticism against her mishandling a major deal to sell the state's international airport, known as Frankfurt 
Hahn. It was an early test for Dreyer's new coalition government, which took office two months ago after her center-
left SPD managed to get 36.2 percent of the vote and form a coalition with the Green party and the neoliberal FDP. 
This already signified a setback for the SPD in the state - for years it had needed only ecologist Green support in 
order to govern. Dreyer said she was "very happy" about the "clear vote" to keep her in office. The tally came 
directly along party lines, with the three coalition parties standing behind their leader and opposition parties like the 
Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and right-wing populists the Alternative for 
Germany (AfD) voting to oust her. Major deal with Chinese fails to materialize The vote revolved around a failed bid 
to sell the state's Hahn airport, which effectively serves as a subsidiary to Germany's largest hub, Frankfurt Main, in 
the neighboring state of Hesse. Despite being called "Frankfurt Hahn," the airport is almost two hours' drive from 
Germany's financial capital. Located to the north of Idar Oberstein, it is also difficult to access by public transport. 
Low-cost airlines like Ryanair use it to minimize costs compared to operating out of Frankfurt Main. Many major 
airlines also use it for cargo operations. The airport has struggled in recent years as several major freight customers 
have moved operations to Frankfurt, and the state government had planned to sell 82.5 percent of its stake in the 
facility to Chinese investor Shanghai Yiqian Trading. When that deal fell through, most of the blame was placed on 
Dreyer and her administration. "The major responsibility for this debacle [is on Dreyer]. She personally assured the 
public of the reliability of this potential buyer, of the seriousness of this treacherous business," said Julia KlÃ¶ckner of 
the CDU, who was gunning for Dreyer's job during the recent state elections. For many citizens of Rhineland-
Palatinate, however, it is not the government but the tax auditing company KPMG who is to blame for trying to 
broker the deal. A survey conducted by local broadcaster SÃ¼dwestrundfunk showed that 29 percent of those polled 
blamed KPMG, while only 19 percent blamed Dreyer. Another 14 percent blamed the state's interior minister Roger 
Lewentz. The sale of state property is a particularly sensitive topic in Rhineland-Palatinate, following the costly 
expansion, bankruptcy, and then low-cost firesale of the formerly state-owned NÃ¼rburgring race track. That debacle 
contributed to Dreyer taking over the role as state premier from her Social Democrat predecessor Kurt Beck.

What Might Be The Long-Term Impacts Of Brexit On The Online Travel Agencies?
What Might Be The Long-Term Impacts Of Brexit On The Online Travel 
Agencies?

Jul 11, 2016( Trefis: http://www.trefis.com/articles Delivered by Newstex) A while back we explored the possible 
short-term implications of Brexit[1] on the online travel companies. We observed that other than the stock market's 
knee jerk reactions and the possibility of the pound losing value, travel might not be majorly impacted in the short 
run. Let us now explore the long-term implication of Brexit (or Britain's decision to leave the European Union) on the 
online travel companies. The longer term impact on the online travel agency might relate to the market conditions 
for the hotels, airlines, and the tourism sector. 
The hospitality sector in the UK might be adversely impacted as around 70% of all hospitality workers[2] in London 
are migrant workers, according to the Association of British Holidaymakers. In the event that the UK breaks off from 
the EU, these workers would require more compensation in order to work in the UK. This, in turn, could raise the 
hotel room prices in the UK. The airlines in the UK witnessed a dramatic decline in their stock prices following the 
Brexit announcement. The Open Skies agreement between the US and the EU facilitates low cost carriers such as 
Ryanair and EasyJet to operate within the EU. If the UK does leave the EU this might no longer be an advantage 
that these carriers will enjoy[3]. Easyjet's stock has declined by ~30% since the Brexit announcement and Ryanair's 
stock has declined by ~15%. Also, due to a declining value of British pounds, though the travel to the UK might be 
cheaper for travelers from the EU or US, however, the travelers from the UK might find it more expensive to travel 
to 
these 
geographies.

Ryanair pilots questioned in jobs probe
Ryanair pilots questioned in jobs probe

Jul 06, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Police and customs 
officials have visited Ryanair bases at six German airports to interview 'contract' pilots on hiring practices. 
Prosecutors say the probe relates to two British firms servicing the budget airline. 
German media reported Wednesday that customs and police officers had visited "contract" pilots at airline facilities 
as well as private quarters in recent days, asking questions as to whether they were truly self-employed?<nl/> 
German law against illegal employment was amended in 2014 to enforce payment of tax and social welfare 
contributions, using a special Federal Customs Administration unit based in Cologne.<nl/> A media consortium 
comprising two German public broadcasters, WDR and NDR, and the SÃ¼ddeutscher Zeitung (SZ) newspaper said 
numerous pilots were asked who paid them, whether Ryanair provided facilities, and who had offered them 
contracts.<nl/> Another key line of questioning was whether they received holiday and sick pay.<nl/> `Contractor' 
model<nl/> WDR reporters said the "contractor model" was used by Ryanair to cheaply hire a "large quantity" of its 
pilots. They were required to set up single-person firms in Ireland whose services were assigned to Ryanair by two 
British personnel firms acting as intermediaries.<nl/> The online version of the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit 
said computers had been seized during multiple inspections on Tuesday.<nl/> In the past, Ryanair has described its 
business model as legal and on Wednesday told the media consortium that its pilots must pay tax - whether they 
were self-employed or on the airline staff payroll.<nl/> Why not Ryanair direct?<nl/> European ECA pilots' trade 
union President Dirk Polloczek said it was incomprehensible that the German probe was directed against pilots but 
not against Ryanair itself.<nl/> Flight Captain James Phillips of the German trade union Cockpit said many of the 
pilots interviewed by customs and police were outraged.<nl/> "Some fear even that because of the investigations 
they could loose their flying licenses," Phillips said.<nl/> Lengthy probe against Ryanair<nl/> Koblenz-based public 
prosecutor Hans-Peter Gandner confirmed a similar report on the inspections by police and customs carried in the 
online version of the Die Zeit newspaper, saying underlying the visits was a years-long probe against two British 
personnel providers that assigned pilots to Ryanair.<nl/> He told the German news agency DPA that dozens of 
officers had visited Berlin's second airport SchÃ¶nefeld and Cologne/Bonn as well as the regional airports at Weeze 
in North Rhine-Westphalia state, Hahn in Rhineland-Palatinate, Bremen and Baden-Baden in southwestern 
Germany.<nl/> WDR reporters said authorities had also seized USB data sticks and filed documents during 
searches of pilots' private accommodation.<nl/> Clampdown on fictitious self-employment<nl/> In 2014, Chancellor 
Angela Merkel's coalition government vowed in a social welfare ministryreport to "improve the fight against fictitious 
self-employment by strengthening cooperation between regional authorities and the Federal Customs 
Administration." <nl/> "The abuse of freedom of movement [within the EU] under cover of gainful employment is to 
be effectively prevented. At the same time, it must be ensured that immigrants do not have to work in exploitative 
Ryanair pilots questioned in jobs probe
employment, and firm steps must be taken to counter fictitious self-employment," the report said.<nl/> Ryanair 
reacts to Brexit<nl/> In the wake of Britain's vote to leave the EU, Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said late last 
month that the airline would avoid new extra links to Britain and would instead use 50 aircraft on order mainly for 
flights across the EU continent. He also said Ryanair was seeking a stake in Argentina's aviation sector.<nl/>

Jul 05, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) The past week, which was 
a day short of trading as Independence Day was observed on Jul 4, saw United Continental Holdings UAL[1], the 
parent company of United Airlines, revealing encouraging news on the labor frontShares of the carrier gained 
following the news that the leadership of the union representing its 25,000+ flight attendants has accepted the 
tentative deal pertaining to pay and other financial details. To become operational, the agreement will now have to 
be ratified. United Continental was also in the news owing to its decision to initiate flights to Auckland.Apart from the 
above update, the past week saw the Atlanta, GA-based Delta Air Lines DAL[2] announcing the traffic numbers for 
June. Similar to May, load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) declined in June too as traffic growth was 
outpaced by capacity expansion. 
The carrier also unveiled a bearish guidance for the second quarter.European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[3] also grabbed headlines by virtue of its impressive traffic numbers for June, despite the multiple 
challenges. The past week also saw updates from Alaska Air Group ALK[4] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[5].On the 
price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline index gained 2.63% to $82.91 over the past week as stocks recovered from the 
lows 
following 
the 
Brexit 
vote.

Industry 
Price Index[6]Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for June 29, 2016[7].Recap of the Past Week's Most Important 
Stories1. United Continental inked a tentative pay-related deal with the labor union (Association of Flight Attendants 
or AFA), representing its flight attendants. The agreement aims to bring the carrier's flight attendants under a single 
work group. Apparently, this is the first contract pertaining to the cabin crew members since 2010 when United 
Airlines and Continental Airlines merged resulting in the formation of United Continental Holdings (read more: 
United Continental Gains on Tentative Labor Deal with AFA[8]).On a separate note, United Continental, in a 
customer friendly move, launched non-stop flights connecting its premier Pacific gateway at San Francisco 
International Airport and Auckland. By launching its first service to Auckland, the Chicago-based carrier as officially 
started its joint venture revenue sharing agreement with Air New Zealand.2. Delta announced a 3.1% increase in 
revenue passenger miles (RPMs: a measure of traffic) and 3.5% rise in average seat miles (ASMs: a measure of 
capacity) for the month of June. Load factor decreased 40 basis points to 87.7% in the month.The company 
witnessed a 5% drop in PRASM in the month mainly due to volatile foreign currency exchange rates and soft 
passenger yields from domestic markets. The metric is expected to decline approximately 5% in the second quarter 
(the previous guidance had called for a decline of around 4.5%).Delta expects operating margin to be around 17% 
Airline Stock Roundup: United Continental 's Flight Attendants Deal on Track; Delta Traffic in Focus
in the second quarter (the previous guidance had projected the metric around 21%). Average fuel price per gallon is 
expected in the band of $1.95 to $2.00. System capacity is projected to increase approximately 3%.3. Alaska 
Airlines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, announced that it intends to introduce flights between 
Seattle and San Luis Obispo, CA from Apr 13, 2017. The daily and non-stop flight between these destinations aims 
to meet the surge in traffic on this popular route (read more: Alaska Airlines to Fly Between Seattle and San Luis 
Obispo[9]).On a separate note, Alaska Air Group reported a 10.9% increase in June traffic. Capacity too increased 
11.7% while load factor declined 70 basis points to 86%. At the end of the first six months of 2016, Alaska Air 
generated RPMs of 18 billion (up 11.1% year over year) and ASMs of 21.5 billion (up 12%). Load factor declined 70 
basis points to 83.5%.4. Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings reported solid traffic data for the month of June on the 
back of its customer friendly 'Always Getting Better' scheme. The carrier's traffic climbed 11% to 10.6 million in the 
month. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) rose to 94% from 93% a year ago.5. In a customer-
friendly move, low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways announced that it would cover Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) Pre enrollment cost for its Mosaic TrueBlue members, the carrier's most frequent fliers. The 
airline has introduced this limited time offer to cut down TSA screening checkpoint wait times. Frequent fliers who 
attained Mosaic status before Jun 30, 2016 are eligible for this offer. The offer comes at an appropriate time as the 
ongoing summer has been predicted by the Airlines for America to be the busiest one for US carriers.Performance 
The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 
months. The table shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week, as stocks recovered from the 
Brexit tremors. Shares of American Airlines Group AAL[10] appreciated the most (5.88%).Over the past six months, 
the majority of the airline stocks lost value, leading to a 0.91% decline in the NYSE ARCA Airline index. American 
Airlines was the primary laggard with shares depreciating 28.31% over the same period.What's Next in the Airline 
Space?We expect airline heavyweights like Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[11] and American Airlines Group to report 
their June traffic numbers in the coming days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Jul 01, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate Release 
Chicago, IL - July 01, 2016 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Airlines, Part 1, including Delta Air Lines 
(DAL[1]), Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[2]), American Airlines Group (AAL[3]) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV[4]). 
Industry: Airlines, Part 1 Link: 
https://www.zacks.com/commentary/84559/airline-industry-stock-outlook---july-2016 [5] Airlines Impacted by Terror 
Attacks, Brexit As had been widely expected, the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world, rattling 
global financial markets. Airline stocks have been hit hard with fears of travel demand slackening. According to the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA), with Brexit materializing, the U.K.'s air passenger market is expected 
to shrink in the band of 3% to 5% by 2020. In fact, the Brexit decision has worsened matters for U.S. carriers with 
exposure to Britain. Moreover, prior to Brexit, Britain had been part of the EU's single aviation market. 
Consequently, carriers of member states could fly freely to/within members. Now with Britain exiting the EU, the 
entire issue has gotten complicated. Prior to Brexit, airline stocks had been grappling with issues such as the mass 
shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, FL and the explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport on June 12. Fears that 
such attacks could lead to a dip in air travel demand resulted in widespread sell-offs in the aviation sector. To add 
to the distress, the frequency of such attacks is increasing by the day. The disappearance of an EgyptAir jet in May 
is also feared to be an act of terrorism. Airline stocks were hurt[6] even then. Moreover, the Brussels attacks in 
March dealt a heavy blow to Delta Air Lines ( DAL[7]) as its passengers were among the casualties reported in the 
departure area at Brussels' Zaventem Airport. The Atlanta, GA-based carrier's top line was negatively impacted to 
the tune of $5 million by the attacks. In fact, on May 31, the U.S. State Department issued a global travel alert to 
U.S. citizens citing the possibility of terror attacks similar to those in Brussels and Paris (in Nov 2015). The ongoing 
European Soccer Championship in France has attracted many tourists. Moreover, the Catholic Church's World 
Youth Day scheduled to be held in Poland shortly is also likely to be heavily attended. Citing fears of low travel 
demand, in May, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings ( RYAAY[8]) issued a 'cautious' outlook for fiscal 2017 
on expectations of low airfares. Moreover, travel company Thomas Cook revealed a 5% decline in summer 
bookings compared to last year. The twin threats are primarily responsible for the NYSE ARCA Airline index 
declining more than 5% over the last 30 days. PRASM Concerns As was the case in the past few quarters, issues 
related to passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a measure of unit revenue) hurt revenues of airline 
stocks in the first quarter as well. The metric, which is a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier, is 
expected to dent top-line growth in the second-quarter as well. For example, American Airlines Group ( AAL[9]) 
Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: Delta Air Lines , Ryanair, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines
forecasts a 6% to 8% drop in the metric for the second quarter. Lower fuel surcharges on international flights due to 
weak oil prices have been one of the main reasons behind the persistent decline in PRASM. Furthermore, 
outbreaks of diseases like the Zika virus and disputes similar to the ongoing one between legacy U.S. carriers and 
their Gulf counterparts pose challenges to the stocks in the airline space. The tough times for airlines is exemplified 
by the fact that the 'Trans-Airline' sector currently has a Zacks Industry Rank #222 - placing it in the bottom 1/3rd of 
the 260+ industry groups. Estimates Trimmed In view of the headwinds mentioned above, earnings per share 
estimates were lowered by analysts ahead of the first-quarter earnings season, thus making it easier for companies 
to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter gone by. Consequently, the plethora of earnings beats in 
the space in the first quarter was mainly due to the 'lowered bar' and is not anything to be excited about. A major 
tailwind for airlines in recent times -- cheap oil -- has in all probability been priced in, as prices have been soft for 
almost two years now. Airline players, as in the past few quarters, dished out a below-par performance on the top-
line front. In fact, the picture might well be similar in the second quarter as well. This can be gauged from our latest 
Zacks Earning Trends report[10] which predicts that earnings per share for the S...00 players in the transportation 
sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), of which airlines is a part, will decline 11%. Meanwhile, revenues are 
projected to decline 1.3%. Oil Rebound Another worrying factor for airlines is that oil prices are currently on their 
way up and hovering around the $50 a barrel mark. This marks a significant increase from the second half of 
February, when the commodity had slumped to a 12-year low of $26.21. Despite oil's massive recovery since 
February, it's still around $50 - about half the level witnessed in mid-2014. Moreover, many believe that the odds 
are firmly stacked against a sustained rally. Therefore, we believe bottom-line expansion for airline players will be 
evident at least in the remaining quarters of 2016. Financial Strength Rally or not, it cannot be denied that soft oil 
prices have been a huge blessing to carriers by virtue of trimming their operating expenses significantly, thereby 
causing huge savings. For example, Delta expects to generate savings of around $3 billion in 2016 due to low fuel 
costs. Naturally, carriers are in the pink of financial health, courtesy the huge cost savings arising from cheap oil. 
This has given rise to a surge in shareholder friendly activities such as dividend payments and buybacks in the 
space. For example, in May, Delta and Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV[11]) hiked their respective quarterly dividend 
payouts. The massive profits generated by carriers have encouraged them to shell out significant amounts to 
employees under their profit sharing schemes. Moreover, buoyed by their financial strength, carriers are constantly 
making additional infrastructural investments to enhance the flying experience of passengers. Want the latest

Lufthansa reaches deal with cabin crew to end dispute
Lufthansa reaches deal with cabin crew to end dispute

Jun 30, 2016( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex) 
Germany's flagship carrier has settled a long-running dispute with the cabin crew union UFO after six months of 
arbitration. 
Full details of the plan will be revealed next week. The two sides "have come to a comprehensive agreement," the 
union said in a statement Thursday. The deal, which will be formally accepted on July 5, follows a bitter industrial 
dispute that has lasted nearly two years and led to the airline's longest ever walkout. Lufthansa management faced 
possibly their biggest ever test when they set out to cut costs and reduce pension expenses in the face of 
competition from low-cost rivals such as Easyjet and Ryanair. But the UFO union, which represents around 19,000 
workers, staged multiple strikes to press its demands. Last November, cabin staff staged a seven day stoppage, 
which led to the cancellation of 4,700 flights and left more than half a million passengers grounded. Although the 
union agreed in January to a 2.2 percent pay rise for flight attendants and a one-off 3,000 euro ($3,300) cash 
payment for last year, the two sides went to arbitration to negotiate outstanding issues, including early retirement 
provision and working conditions. Thursday's deal was reached under the mediation of Matthias Platzeck, the 
former Social Democrat president of the regional state of Brandenburg. Lufthansa has also faced multiple strikes by 
its pilots and reached a wage deal for its 30,000 ground staff last November. mm/cw (AFP, AP)

Jun 30, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Airlines Impacted by 
Terror Attacks, BrexitAs had been widely expected, the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world, 
rattling global financial markets. Airline stocks have been hit hard with fears of travel demand slackening. According 
to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with Brexit materializing, the U.K.'s air passenger market is 
expected to shrink in the band of 3% to 5% by 2020. In fact, the Brexit decision has worsened matters for U.S. 
carriers with exposure to Britain.Moreover, prior to Brexit, Britain had been part of the EU's single aviation market. 
Consequently, carriers of member states could fly freely to/within members. 
Now with Britain exiting the EU, the entire issue has gotten complicated.Prior to Brexit, airline stocks had been 
grappling with issues such as the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, FL and the explosion at the Shanghai 
Pudong airport on June 12. Fears that such attacks could lead to a dip in air travel demand resulted in widespread 
sell-offs in the aviation sector.To add to the distress, the frequency of such attacks is increasing by the day. The 
disappearance of an EgyptAir jet in May is also feared to be an act of terrorism. Airline stocks were hurt[1] even 
then. Moreover, the Brussels attacks in March dealt a heavy blow to Delta Air Lines (DAL) as its passengers were 
among the casualties reported in the departure area at Brussels' Zaventem Airport. The Atlanta, GA-based carrier's 
top line was negatively impacted to the tune of $5 million by the attacks.In fact, on May 31, the U.S. State 
Department issued a global travel alert to U.S. citizens citing the possibility of terror attacks similar to those in 
Brussels and Paris (in Nov 2015). The ongoing European Soccer Championship in France has attracted many 
tourists. Moreover, the Catholic Church's World Youth Day scheduled to be held in Poland shortly is also likely to be 
heavily attended.Citing fears of low travel demand, in May, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) 
issued a 'cautious' outlook for fiscal 2017 on expectations of low airfares. Moreover, travel company Thomas Cook 
revealed a 5% decline in summer bookings compared to last year.The twin threats are primarily responsible for the 
NYSE ARCA Airline index declining more than 5% over the last 30 days.PRASM Concerns As was the case in the 
past few quarters, issues related to passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a measure of unit 
revenue) hurt revenues of airline stocks in the first quarter as well. The metric, which is a measure of sales relative 
to capacity for a carrier, is expected to dent top-line growth in the second-quarter as well. For example, American 
Airlines Group (AAL) forecasts a 6% to 8% drop in the metric for the second quarter. Lower fuel surcharges on 
international flights due to weak oil prices have been one of the main reasons behind the persistent decline in 
PRASM. Furthermore, outbreaks of diseases like the Zika virus and disputes similar to the ongoing one between 
legacy U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts pose challenges to the stocks in the airline space. The tough times 
for airlines is exemplified by the fact that the 'Trans-Airline' sector currently has a Zacks Industry Rank #222 - 
Airline Industry Stock Outlook - July 2016
placing it in the bottom 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups.Estimates Trimmed In view of the headwinds mentioned 
above, earnings per share estimates were lowered by analysts ahead of the first-quarter earnings season, thus 
making it easier for companies to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter gone by. Consequently, 
the plethora of earnings beats in the space in the first quarter was mainly due to the 'lowered bar' and is not 
anything to be excited about. A major tailwind for airlines in recent times -- cheap oil -- has in all probability been 
priced in, as prices have been soft for almost two years now.Airline players, as in the past few quarters, dished out 
a below-par performance on the top-line front. In fact, the picture might well be similar in the second quarter as well. 
This can be gauged from our latest Zacks Earning Trends report[2] which predicts that earnings per share for the 
S...00 players in the transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), of which airlines is a part, will decline 11%. 
Meanwhile, revenues are projected to decline 1.3%.Oil ReboundAnother worrying factor for airlines is that oil prices 
are currently on their way up and hovering around the $50 a barrel mark. This marks a significant increase from the 
second half of February, when the commodity had slumped to a 12-year low of $26.21.Despite oil's massive 
recovery since February, it's still around $50 - about half the level witnessed in mid-2014. Moreover, many believe 
that the odds are firmly stacked against a sustained rally. Therefore, we believe bottom-line expansion for airline 
players will be evident at least in the remaining quarters of 2016.Financial StrengthRally or not, it cannot be denied 
that soft oil prices have been a huge blessing to carriers by virtue of trimming their operating expenses significantly, 
thereby causing huge savings. For example, Delta expects to generate savings of around $3 billion in 2016 due to 
low fuel costs.Naturally, carriers are in the pink of financial health, courtesy the huge cost savings arising from 
cheap oil. This has given rise to a surge in shareholder friendly activities such as dividend payments and buybacks 
in the space. For example, in May, Delta and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) hiked their respective quarterly dividend 
payouts.The massive profits generated by carriers have encouraged them to shell out significant amounts to 
employees under their profit sharing schemes. Moreover, buoyed by their financial strength, carriers are constantly 
making additional infrastructural investments to enhance the flying experience of passengers.Alaska/Virgin America 
DealIn a bid to expand its operations, particularly on the West Coast, Alaska Air Group (ALK) inked a deal worth 
approximately $4 billion in Apr 2016, inclusive of debt and capitalized aircraft operating leases to buy low-cost 
carrier Virgin America (VA). The deal, if it materializes, will enable Alaska Air Group to expand significantly and gain 
greater access to key cities across the U.S.The expansion of Alaska Air Group following the merger will make it the 
fifth-largest among U.S. carriers in terms of traffic, displacing JetBlue Airways (JBLU) from the position. We note 
that airline stocks were in bad shape financially until a few years ago, such as when Delta plunged into bankruptcy 
in 2005. However, a spate of mergers led to a rebound in the space.Consequently, mergers have been beneficial 
for the airline industry going by past records. Currently, there is the added incentive of cheap oil. With oil prices 
unlikely to touch the highs seen in mid-2014 any time soon, the Alaska-Virgin merger (if it happens) should flourish 
in the favorable backdrop.Bullish Forecasts At its Annual General Meeting in Dublin in June, the IATA increased its 
projection for 2016 global net profit for the industry to $39.4 billion from the earlier $36.3 billion. The comparable 
2015 figure was $35.3 billion. In the event of the forecast coming true, 2016 will be the fifth successive year of profit 
improvement for the airline industry.Cheap oil, which is projected at $45 per barrel in 2016, is the primary catalyst 
behind the bright forecast. Fuel bill is projected to fall to $127 billion in 2016, which represents a significant decline 
from $226 billion recorded only two years ago. Although it is a fact that most carriers hedge at least some of their 
fuel costs, the majority of them should still continue to benefit considerably from the plunge in oil prices. Notably, 
carriers use a combination of calls, swaps and collars at varying WTI crude-equivalent price levels to hedge fuel 
costs.The bulk of the global profits ($22.9 billion) is expected to come from the North American region. The rosy 
picture painted by the IATA for North American carriers, comes shortly after the forecast provided by Airlines for 
America ('A4A'). According to the projection, the three month period between June and August will be the busiest 
one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel.Cuba Approval EncourageIn what is seen as a major positive for airline 
stocks, The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) authorized six U.S.-based carriers to operate scheduled 
flights to nine second-tier Cuban cities, thereby taking a step toward restoration of diplomatic ties with the island 
nation after more than 50 years. Following the DOT approval, the carriers can start operating commercial flights to 
the island this fall itself.The authorized carriers include airline heavy weights like American Airlines Group, 
Southwest Airlines Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. The other airlines that have secured a go-ahead for the same 
are Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways and Sun Country Airlines. With Cuba a re-emerging tourist spot, the approval to 
launch commercial flights to the country should aid the top lines of the carriers significantly.Moreover, approval is 
yet to come to fly to the much sought-after Havana. The DOT is likely to announce its decision on Havana routes 
later this summer. Approval to fly on the highly in demand Havana route should augment top lines further by

years.KLM has announced it is relaunching its Dublin to Amsterdam route for the first time in 50 years, with the 
service set to restart from the end of October. 
The service will comprise of two direct flights a day between Dublin Airport and the airline's European hub at 
Amsterdam Schiphol. Departures from Dublin are scheduled to be at 5.55am and 1.15pm, timed to coincide with 
connections to long-haul destinations across the globe, and return fares will be priced from â‚¬99. Amsterdam 
Schiphol is one of the largest airport hubs in Europe with connections globally, and the new direct flights are 
expected to open up improved transport options for Irish passengers. Onward connections from Amsterdam include 
major cities such as Johannesburg, Havana, Beijing and Hong Kong. The announcement means Amsterdam is one 
of the best coonnected cities from Dublin, and adds to existing daily flights operated by Aer Lingus and Ryanair. 
Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: 'This announcement by KLM is more good news for Irish tourism, as 
we head into the high season. Not only will it help grow visitor numbers from the Netherlands, but this new flight will 
offer connectivity from other important tourism markets, including North America, Asia and the Middle East. We look 
forward to co-operating with KLM to maximise the promotion of this new service from Amsterdam to Dublin.'

content/uploads/2016/06/breaking-point-1440022_1280.jpgThe referendum has brought uncertainty to the Irish 
economy.Industry bodies from across the foodservice and hospitality spectrum have reacted with caution and a 
level of uncertainty following Britain's historic referendum, in which the country voted to leave the European Union. 
In a statement, the Irish Hotels Federation (IHF), said:It is too early to predict the effect that today's decision will 
have on Irish tourism given the uncertainty around the future relationship between the UK and the EU and the time 
it may take for the nature of that relationship to be agreed. While Ireland's competitive tourism offering will help 
mitigate any negative impact, there is a risk that economic uncertainty and a weaker Sterling could impact on visitor 
numbers from the UK, which is our largest source of inbound tourists. The Irish Hotels Federation is therefore 
calling on the Government to set up a dedicated working group to examine the short and long-term implications and 
to ensure appropriate measures are put in place to enable Irish tourism react quickly.The parent company of 
airlines Ryanair and Aer Lingus, International Airlines' Group (IAG), has warned of a potential fall in UK passenger 
numbers following the vote. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has predicted that a weakened 
sterling, coupled with a shrinking UK economy, could cut outbound passenger numbers in the coming years. The 
UK is one of the largest markets for Ryanair and Aer Lingus, exposing both airlines to increased vulnerability should 
passenger numbers fall. On the vote, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: 'It's going to mean that 
when we are looking at investing, we will look outside the UK.' Tourism Ireland has noted the uncertainty created by 
the referendum result, saying: 'general economic uncertainty can cause consumers to be more cautious with their 
discretionary spend and this may impact on tourism flows in the short to medium term. 'Secondly, movements in 
currency impact on competitiveness and British visitors to the Eurozone, for the short term, are likely to see 
holidays being more expensive.' Sounding a positive note, Tourism Ireland expects that short term gains may be 
possible for tourism into Northern Ireland as a result of a weakened currency. The tourism body continues to 
support the maintenance of the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland, and pointed out that the vote will 
have no impact on the running of the cross-border organisation. Shaun Quinn, chief executive of FÃ¡ilte Ireland, 
said: 'FÃ¡ilte Ireland will be monitoring any short term impacts of a devalued sterling on tourist numbers to Ireland 
and working with businesses in the sector to develop strategies to address any arising competitiveness challenges.'

Chicago, IL - June 27, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the 
Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include American Airlines Group (AAL[1]), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU[2]), 
Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[3]), Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
(DAL[4]) and United Continental Holdings (UAL[5]). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. 
Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[6]. Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog: 4 U.S. Airline Stocks at Risk 
as U.K. Votes for Brexit Putting all speculation to rest, the Britons have voted in favor of exiting the European 
Union. Results of the U.K. referendum revealed that 51.9% of the votes (17,410,742) were cast in favor of Brexit 
while 48.1% (16,141,242) opposed the notion. Going into details, 53.2%, 38%, 51.7% and 44.3% of the participants 
in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively, cast their votes in support of leaving the bloc after 
over four decades. As had been widely expected, the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world, 
rattling the global financial market. Following Britain's decision to depart, the pound has taken a beating, slumping 
to its lowest[7] point in 30 years. Also, the FTSE 100 tanked over 8% immediately after the commencement of 
trading. The impact has been so severe that Prime Minister David Cameron announced his decision to resign by 
October. The effects of Brexit are expected to catastrophic as far as British markets are concerned, at least in the 
short term. US Markets to Feel the Tremor In such a scenario, the ripple effects are expected to be felt across the 
Atlantic. With Britain accounting for 10% of revenues for 30[8] S...00 players, things do not seem to be rosy for US 
stocks. In fact, firms in the U.S. with exposure to Britain are likely to hit badly with the tumbling pound reducing U.S. 
earnings on repatriating the income. Airlines to Face the Brunt? The airline sector is already grappling with the 
effects of the recent terror attacks - the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando and the explosion at the Shanghai 
Pudong airport. Fears of travel demand waning with such attacks on the rise have caused carriers like American 
Airlines Group (AAL[9]) and JetBlue Airways Corp. ( JBLU[10]) to trade near/at their 52-week lows. Apart from this, 
airlines are struggling with respect to unit revenues. The tough times for airlines is exemplified by the NYSE ARCA 
Airline index declining over 4% since the Orlando shootings. Moreover, the bearish effect on the industry can be 
gauged from the from the fact that the 'Trans-Airline' sector currently has a Zacks Industry Rank #204 - placing it in 
the bottom 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. The Brexit decision has worsened matters for U.S. airlines with 
exposure to Britain. In fact, European airlines like British Airways and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[11]) might face the 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: American Airlines Group, JetBlue Airways , Ryanair Holdings , Delta Air 
Lines and United Continental Holdings
brunt with leisure and business travel demand taking a hit. Moreover, Britain, by virtue of its EU membership, has 
been part of the EU's single aviation market till today. Consequently, carriers of member states could fly freely 
to/within members. Now with Britain exiting EU, the entire issue has become complex. What's in Store for US 
Carriers? We expect U.S. airlines to be hit by the Brexit results too. In fact, carriers with significant exposure are 
likely to feel the pinch more than others. The 2007 open skies agreement had facilitated the travel of U.S. through 
the EU apart from encouraging tie-ups with their European counterparts. Now with Brexit materializing, the future 
direction to be taken by the EU-US Open Skies Agreement is anybody's guess. For now, we have identified 4 U.S. 
carriers that could be at risk following UK's vote to leave the EU. American Airlines Group Inc: Based in Fort Worth, 
Texas, the carrier has high exposure to Britain mainly due to its partnership with British Airways. The partnership 
apart, the carrier apparently has a higher exposure to UK than its peers with respect to capacity with 6.2% of round-
trip capacity [12] focused on the nation. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL[13]) : Based in Atlanta, GA, the carrier operates 
quite a number of flights to Britain and has a significant stake in British airline -Virgin Atlantic. Last month, Delta 
strengthened its ties with Virgin Atlantic. The carriers altered their respective schedules for the summer of 2017 to 
facilitate travel between the U.S. and the U.K. The introduction of four weekly flights connecting Portland and 
London from May 26, 2017, was the highlight of the program. The Brexit vote has tossed the future of this 
partnership. United Continental Holdings (UAL[14]) : This Chicago-based carrier flies extensively to the U.K. which 
could hurt its profits substantially. In fact, the carrier is likely to be affected the most according to an Investors' News 
Daily report. Alaska Air Group : This Seattle, WA-based owner of Alaska Airlines might also feel the pinch of 
Britain's departure. The carrier has a partnership with British Airways for some of its key routes. Usually passengers 
travelling domestically with Alaska book the carry forward trip on one of its partner airlines such as British Airways. 
With the pound losing value with respect to the U.S. dollar, traffic from Britain will is likely to suffer. As a result, 
Alaska's revenue and volumes would decline on domestic routes which serve as connectors for trans-Atlantic 
destinations. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best

Jun 27, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Thomson ReutersVia 
Dave Lutz at JonesTrading, here's a quick guide to what traders are talking about on Monday: Good Morning! US 
Futures are on overnight lows, adding to their largest daily drop since August losing 70bp as Brexit angst continues 
to reverberate. Euro markets are getting whacked again, with the DAX nearing off 2% and FTSE drops 1.6%. Travel 
stocks are getting destroyed. 
EasyJet off 20%, British Air and RyanAir 10%, AirFrance, Lufthansa and SAS 5% - while Banks under sharp 
pressure- trading on RBS and Barclays is suspended - RBS down almost 30% in just two days. Seems like every 
sell-side house is downgrading UK / EU banks this AM. The FTSE is holding above Friday's lows (for now), as the 
Miners, Utilities and Staples all rise. Spanish voters gravitated toward the ruling party, initially sparking a 2% rally 
which has reversed lower quickly - Volumes across the continent are pacing a double from normal turnover. Was 
quiet in Asia in comparison, with Nikkei rebounding 2% from Friday's bloodletting despite $/Y nearing 100 as Abe 
chattered intervention, while Shanghai added 1.5% as the PBoC weakened the Yuan the most since last August. 
Most EM markets in Asia managed to close in the green. Havens are on fire as 10-year gilt yields fall below 1% for 
the first time ever and German 10YY roams around -10bp. This has a bid under Treasuries and Gold, with the 
yellow metal adding 1%. Sterling continuing its collapse against Euro and $, where it is thru 30Y lows - helping the 
DXY basket near Friday's highs. Industrial metals acting well early, with Copper climbing 50bp - but Oil is getting hit 
for 60bp and just off Friday's lows. Looks like a full ripper north in the Softs, led by 1%+ pops in Corn and 
Soybeans. Risk of 'Coordinated Action' headlines is high today, with the leaders of the EU's three largest remaining 
countries â€” Germany's Angela Merkel, France's FranÃ§ois Hollande and Italy's Matteo Renzi â€” meeting in Berlin - 
while ECB's Draghi, Fed's Yellen, BOE's Carney, and PBOC's Zhou are together at the ECB Forum in Portugal. 
Ahead of us today, we get Advance Goods Trade Balance at 8:30, followed by Markit US Services PMI at 9:45 and 
Dallas Fed Manf. Activity at 10:30. Later this afternoon around 1:30, we could see headers from ECB's Draghi, 
Fed's Yellen, BOE's Carney, and PBOC's Zhou from Portugal around 1:30. The Last day of Supremes' term brings 
the biggest abortion ruling in almost 10years - probably around 10am in DC.NOW WATCH: Chick-fil-A is giving out

Jun 27, 2016( Stock Market Today: http://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/ Delivered by Newstex) The stock 
market was sharply lower with one hour left to go in Monday's session as Wall Street pondered the economic 
implications of last week's Brexit news. Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate (STX) led the Nasdaq 100 lower, 
falling around 10% each. 
American Express (AXP) and DuPont (DD) weighed on the Dow, with losses of around 4% apiece. The Nasdaq 
slumped 2.8%, the S...00 fell 2.1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.8%. Volume on the NYSE and 
Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Friday's levels. The put/call ratio was at 1.23 in late-afternoon trading, 
indicating excessive fear in the market. Fear has been seen at many market bottoms in the past. Financials were hit 
hard again, as the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) slumped another 3%, bringing its two-session decline to 
8%. Energy-related industry groups also lagged as benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled at $46.33 
a barrel, down nearly 3%. Utilities outperformed. IBD 50[1] name WEC Energy (WEC) was among a small group of 
gainers. Shares added close to 2%. B...oods (BGS), Dollar General (DG) and CoreSite Realty (COR) also gained. 
The U.S. dollar rallied for the second straight session, and the British pound fell hard again after hitting a 30-year 
low Friday. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield shed another 10 basis points to 1.46%. In the stock market today[2]. 
Tyler Technologies (TYL) also bucked the downtrend, rising 2%. Breakouts don't have much of a chance in a weak 
market, but the tech services firm is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 160.69 buy point. Tyler is one of 
several strong-performing tech services firms. See who the others are with IBD Stock Checkup[3]. Meanwhile, news 
of a new summer loyalty program didn't help Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). Shares lost 3% and were down 19% 
year-to-date. On the downside, European discount airline Ryanair (RYAAY) faced more selling after Friday's 4% 
haircut. Shares lost an additional 15%. Acuity Brands (AYI) slumped 5.5% ahead of its earnings report Wednesday 
before the open. [ 1]: http://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/ [ 2]:

Jun 24, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Ryanair, the Irish low-
cost airline, is 24-hour Â£9.99 flash sale for people who "need a getaway" after the UK voted to leave the European 
Union. An ad for the promotion on Twitter takes on the famous "hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" monkeys 
and replaces them with UKIP leader Nigel Farage, former London Mayor Boris Johnson, and justice secretary 
Michael Gove â€” the leading three figures of the Leave campaign. Tweet Embed:

that it had sent out a marketing email earlier on Friday morning â€” hours ahead of the official referendum results â€” 
to promote the sale, reading: "Celebrate remaining in Europe with 1 million seats from Â£9.99."Lower down, the 
email hedged the results a little better (emphasis ours): "As the UK's largest airline, we hope the UK will vote to 
Remain in the EU. To celebrate what we pray will be a big Remain majority, we're launching a 1 million seat sale 
with fares to Europe starting from just Â£9.99 - less than the UK's Â£13 travel tax - for travel in October and 
November, just after midnight tonight until midnight (GMT) Friday." Ryanair CMO Kenny Jacobs tweeted: Tweet

What Does The Brexit Mean For Americans Traveling To Europe?
What Does The Brexit Mean For Americans Traveling To Europe?

Jun 24, 2016( The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex) The United Kingdom 
voted Thursday to leave the European Union.[1] While the actual process of withdrawing from the EU will take 
years, the vote sent immediate shockwaves across Britain's economy[2] and political sphere[3]. How will the Brexit 
affect Americans traveling to Europe this summer? Travel to the U.K. could be cheaper. In the wake of Thursday's 
vote, the British pound hit a 30-year low[4]. Currently it costs $1.37 American dollars to get one pound, down 
from $1.50 on Thursday[5]. While this is terrible news for Britons, it's good news for Americans if the dollar 
continues to surge[6]: vacationers traveling to the U.K. this summer will likely get more bang for their buck[7] in 
London and other favorite spots like Edinburgh and Belfast[8]. Travel to Europe from the U.K. might be pricier. 
If you're planning on country-hopping through Europe after your visit to Britain, be prepared for higher airfares. 
Discount airlines like RyanAir and EasyJet keep prices low in part due to an open skies policy in Europe[9]. Now 
that Britain is exiting the EU, these airlines will likely have to deal with new, more restrictive air service 
agreements[10], which could ultimately lead to more expensive flights. Travelers could be in for a major headache 
with longer U.K. customs lines. At London's Heathrow airport and other U.K. ports of entry, customs lines move 
relatively quickly due to EU citizens' ability to enter through a separate line without any restrictions. When the Brexit 
is in effect, EU travelers could potentially join Americans[11] (and everyone else) in one big line for non-U.K. 
citizens. Charlie Leocha, president of consumer advocacy group Travelers United, told Bloomberg he expects that 
travel in and out of the U.K.[12] "will be an absolute horror show." Ultimately, we're all in for a rough stock market 
ride. While the Brexit vote might have a few upsides for Americans traveling to Britain, stock market volatility[13] is 
still a major concern. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warned[14] before the vote that Britain's exit from the 
European Union could have "significant economic repercussions." Over the next few days, expect to see a major 
rebalancing of currencies as investors' confidence in the EU and Britain wavers.This article originally appeared on

Jun 24, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) IPGMichael Roth, the 
CEO of US-based advertising agency holding company Interpublic Group, has said the initial market volatility 
sparked by the UK voting to leave the European Union "should normalize." Global stock markets crashed on Friday 
morning[1] after the "Brexit" was officially announced. The British pound fell to a 30-year low[2]. At the time of 
writing, all the "big six" advertising agency holding groups â€” except for IPG, which was flat â€” have seen a drop in 
their share prices. Tweet Embed:

Omnicom +1%, Dentsu -13% In a statement sent to Business Insider, Roth said: "The decision will lead to market 
volatility in the short term, no question. But the UK is a key market to our clients and our own company, and 
together we'll find footing in this new world. Longer-term, as long as open trade remains a priority, markets should 
normalize, and that's the time-line we're focused on." Meanwhile, Sir Martin Sorrell, the CEO of the world's biggest 
advertising holding company, UK-based WPP, took a dim view on the vote to leave[3]: "Very disappointed, but the 
electorate has spoken. The resulting uncertainty, which will be considerable, will obviously slow decision-making 
and deter activity. This is not good news, to say the least. However, we must deploy that stiff upper lip and make 
the best of it. Four of WPP's top ten markets are in Western Continental Europe and we must build our presence 
there even further. It just underlines the importance of implementing our strategy: fast-growth markets (BRICs and 
Next 11), digital, data - and horizontality, which ironically means getting our people to work together, not 
apart!"NOW WATCH: Yes, this is a giant baby stroller for adults â€” here's the next time you can see it live[4]See

Jun 24, 2016( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex) Northern Ireland's deputy leader 
Martin McGuinness called on Friday for a vote to unite the two sides of the Irish border as stocks tumbled in the 
economic and political fallout from Britain's decision to quit the EU. Ireland has the EU's fastest-growing economy 
but also more to lose from Brexit than any other member state, with far-reaching implications for its trade, economy, 
security of energy supplies and peace in British-ruled Northern Ireland. After 56 percent of Northern Irish voters 
sought to remain in the EU compared to the 52 percent of the United Kingdom as a whole who voted to leave, Sinn 
Fein's McGuinness demanded that London call a referendum on a united Ireland. 
"The British government now has no democratic mandate to represent the views of the North in any future 
negotiations with the European Union and I do believe that there is a democratic imperative for a 'border poll' to be 
held," McGuinness told national Irish broadcaster RTE. "The implications for all of us on the island of Ireland are 
absolutely massive. This could have very profound implications for our economy (in Northern Ireland)." The call 
from Sinn Fein, Northern Ireland's largest Irish nationalist party, was rebuffed by pro-British First Minister Arlene 
Foster and Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who said there were much more serious issues to deal with. Kenny 
called an emergency cabinet meeting shortly after the result and afterwards published a plan his government had 
prepared in advance, listing actions it would take over trade, investment, British-Irish relations and Northern Ireland. 
Unabiguously negative Ireland's central bank had warned that a withdrawal would hurt economic growth and jobs 
and significantly impact the financial sector, while a government-commissioned report found it could cut trade with 
Britain by at least 20 percent. Irish banks, whose exposure to the UK accounts for around 21 percent of total assets, 
led the Irish stock market eight percent lower, with shares in Bank of Ireland and permanent tsb down 25 percent 
and 21 percent down at 1345 GMT. Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers Ryanair , building materials 
group Kingspan and packaging producer Smurfit Kappa also fell sharply. The local bourse was down by as much as 
16 percent earlier on Friday. The yield on Ireland's benchmark 10-year bonds [IE10YT=TWEB] was marginally 
higher at a near record low 0.84 percent. The country's debt agency said its funding position was strong with limited 
financing needs for the rest of the year and through the first half of 2017. The cost of insuring exposure to Irish 
government debt nearly doubled on Friday, surging to the highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years. Finance Minister 
Michael Noonan, who earlier this week said an estimated cumulative Brexit-related hit on the Irish economy of as 
much as 1.6 percent of GDP would be "containable", said the outcome would not derail his immediate budget plans. 
"There is nothing catastrophic for Irish fiscal policy on the horizon," Noonan told national broadcaster RTE with the 
caveat that the hit to economic growth could limit his budget plans beyond 2018. Investec Ireland said it will likely 
cut its GDP forecasts for 2016 and 2017 that are currently in line with government predictions of 5 and 4 percent, 
Sinn Fein Calls for Irish Unity Poll as Brexit Fallout Begins
calling the referendum result "unambiguously negative" for the Irish economy. Davy Stockbrokers said that while it 
did not think a Brexit will be sufficient to push Ireland into recession, it could lower growth by 1 to 2 percent in both 
years. Ratings agency S...aid Brexit had no immediate impact on Ireland's sovereign ratings and it expected the 
Irish economy to stay resilient enough to withstand the negative impacts. Brexit may not be all bad for Ireland, and 
Noonan said there may be some upside if companies keen to stay in the EU moved to Dublin from London. The 
contingency plan calls for marketing efforts to be intensified in sectors like financial services for firms wanting to be 
based in the EU. Border controls But of most concern to Dublin is the impact on Northern Ireland, which has the 
only land frontier between the UK and the rest of the EU. It was marked by military checkpoints until a 1998 peace 
deal ended three decades of sectarian violence. Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan told Reuters this week that the 
reintroduction of a hard border would have to be considered in any negotiation and that the return of controls, for 
customs or security, could pose a difficult challenge for the peace process. The dismantling of military border posts 
was a key aspect of the peace deal between Catholic nationalists seeking a united Ireland and Protestant unionists 
who wanted to keep Northern Ireland British. Over 3,600 died in the conflict. Kenny said Ireland would do its utmost 
to keep the country's decades-old common travel area with Britain. His plan says that options for possible customs 
and excise controls, including the role of modern technology, would be analyzed with a view to minimizing trade 
restrictions.

How the Brexit Affects Travel and Tourism

Jun 24, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) After Britain voted to 
leave the European Union, global markets tanked, and many people across the world are wondering what the Brexit 
will mean for them. The implications, both economic and political, are bound to be far reaching. Peak travel season 
is set to begin, and those looking to travel to Britain and countries in the European Union must now consider new 
financial effects on their travel plans due to the Brexit decision.U.S. TravelersBritain and Europe are popular tourist 
destinations for many American travelers, and as a result of the Brexit, it will be much cheaper to visit. 
On Friday, the Great British Pound (GBP) fell to its lowest level in 31 years, with Â£1=$1.38. As for the euro, 
â‚¬1=$1.11. Fortunately for American tourists, these exchange rates could fall even further.According to The 
Washington Post[1], 'Nearly 10% of tourists in Britain last year came from the United States [citing government 
statistics] and Americans spent more than any other nationalityâ€”an average of Â£3,010, or $4,418.' These numbers 
could certainly increase, and for now, Americans travelling to the United Kingdom won't have to dig quite as deep 
into their pockets to catch a show in the West End or to visit Buckingham Palace.Vacation CostAs mentioned 
above, British and European vacations for American travelers are bound to be much cheaper, as tourists will be 
able to stretch the dollar farther. On the flip side, however, British and European travelers will find themselves 
spending more money on everything from food and drink to hotels.The increase in cost depends on what levels the 
euro and GBP settle at. According to The Independent[2], 'The [euro to pound] rate is crucial because [the British] 
take the majority of [their] foreign holidays in the single-currency areaâ€¦[and] prices in destinations including the 
U.S., Dubai and China will rise in proportion with the strength of the dollar relative to sterling (GBP).'The dollar to 
pound rate is also important to consider, especially because oil and airlines are priced in dollars. Any drop in the 
GBP will push up the price of oil, diesel, and aviation fuel, as well as the cost of airline flights.Travel in the EUSince 
1994, any EU airline has been free to fly between two points in Europe thanks to the 'Open Skies' policy, which is 
one of the best things about visiting Europe.Cheap, no-frills airlines like EasyJet EJTTF[3] and RyanAir RYAAY[4] 
grew into lucrative businesses, forcing legacy carriers like Air France AFLYY[5], British Airways, or BA, and 
Lufthansa DLAKY[6] to cut costs and fares in.The 'Open Skies' policy, however, could face bureaucratic hurdles 
going forward, especially for British airliners. 'It is likely that airlines will restructure into separate UK- and EU-based 
corporate entities, adding complexity and cost, and reducing flexibility,' writes the Evening Standard[7]. New air 
service agreements will most certainly have to be made, but because London is both a key destination for many 
airlines as well as a top business and tourist city, it is unlikely that many routes to and from the U.K. will be affected. 
The future of low-cost, wide-choice airline routes for customers will depend on results from these upcoming 
negotiations. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best

4 U.S. Airline Stocks at Risk as UK Opts for Brexit

Jun 24, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Putting all speculation to 
rest, the Britons have voted in favor of exiting the European Union. Results of the U.K. referendum revealed that 
51.9% of the votes (17,410,742) were cast in favor of Brexit while 48.1% (16,141,242) opposed the notion.Going 
into details, 53.2%, 38%, 51.7% and 44.3% of the participants in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, 
respectively, cast their votes in support of leaving the bloc after over four decades. As had been widely expected, 
the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world, rattling the global financial market.Following Britain's 
decision to depart, the pound has taken a beating, slumping to its lowest[1] point in 30 years. Also, the FTSE 100 
tanked over 8% immediately after the commencement of trading. 
The impact has been so severe that Prime Minister David Cameron announced his decision to resign by October. 
The effects of Brexit are expected to catastrophic as far as British markets are concerned, at least in the short 
term.US Markets to Feel the TremorIn such a scenario, the ripple effects are expected to be felt across the Atlantic. 
With Britain accounting for 10% of revenues for 30[2] S...00 players, things do not seem to be rosy for US stocks. In 
fact, firms in the U.S. with exposure to Britain are likely to hit badly with the tumbling pound reducing U.S. earnings 
on repatriating the income.Airlines to Face the Brunt? The airline sector is already grappling with the effects of the 
recent terror attacks - the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando and the explosion at the Shanghai Pudong 
airport. Fears of travel demand waning with such attacks on the rise have caused carriers like American Airlines 
Group AAL[3], JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[4] and Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK[5] to trade near/at their 52-week 
lows. Apart from this, airlines are struggling with respect to unit revenues.The tough times for airlines is exemplified 
by the NYSE ARCA Airline index declining over 4% since the Orlando shootings. Moreover, the bearish effect on 
the industry can be gauged from the from the fact that the 'Trans-Airline' sector currently has a Zacks Industry Rank 
#204 - placing it in the bottom 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. The Brexit decision has worsened matters for U.S. 
airlines with exposure to Britain.In fact, European airlines like British Airways and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] might 
face the brunt with leisure and business travel demand taking a hit. Moreover, Britain, by virtue of its EU 
membership, has been part of the EU's single aviation market till today. Consequently, carriers of member states 
could fly freely to/within members. Now with Britain exiting EU, the entire issue has become complex.What's in 
Store for US Carriers?We expect U.S. airlines to be hit by the Brexit results too. In fact, carriers with significant 
exposure are likely to feel the pinch more than others. The 2007 open skies agreement had facilitated the travel of 
U.S. through the EU apart from encouraging tie-ups with their European counterparts. Now with Brexit materializing, 
the future direction to be taken by the EU-US Open Skies Agreement is anybody's guess. For now, we have 
identified 4 U.S. carriers that could be at risk following UK's vote to leave the EU.American Airlines Group Inc: 
4 U.S. Airline Stocks at Risk as UK Opts for Brexit
Based in Fort Worth, Texas, the carrier has high exposure to Britain mainly due to its partnership with British 
Airways. The partnership apart, the carrier apparently has a higher exposure to UK than its peers with respect to 
capacity with 6.2% of round-trip capacity[7] focused on the nation.Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[8]: Based in Atlanta, 
GA, the carrier operates quite a number of flights to Britain and has a significant stake in British airline -Virgin 
Atlantic. Last month, Delta strengthened its ties with Virgin Atlantic. The carriers altered their respective schedules 
for the summer of 2017 to facilitate travel between the U.S. and the U.K. The introduction of four weekly flights 
connecting Portland and London from May 26, 2017, was the highlight of the program. The Brexit vote has tossed 
the future of this partnership.United Continental Holdings UAL[9]: This Chicago-based carrier flies extensively to the 
U.K. which could hurt its profits substantially. In fact, the carrier is likely to be affected the most according to an 
Investors' News Daily report.Alaska Air Group: This Seattle, WA-based owner of Alaska Airlines might also feel the 
pinch of Britain's departure. The carrier has a partnership with British Airways for some of its key routes. Usually 
passengers travelling domestically with Alaska book the carry forward trip on one of its partner airlines such as 
British Airways. With the pound losing value with respect to the U.S. dollar, traffic from Britain will is likely to suffer. 
As a result, Alaska's revenue and volumes would decline on domestic routes which serve as connectors for trans-
Atlantic destinations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can

Stocks Keep Rally Intact Amid Brexit Vote; Is Now The Time To Snatch Priceline?
Stocks Keep Rally Intact Amid Brexit Vote; Is Now The Time To Snatch 
Priceline?

Jun 23, 2016( Stock Market Today: http://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/ Delivered by Newstex) Stocks 
pushed into higher ground in early-afternoon trading Thursday, boosted by a strong finish among European 
bourses, and even stocks with a heavy investment in Europe helped the push higher. They included Priceline 
(PCLN), whose Booking.com travel site is a major part of its business. The stock broke out of a new cup-with-
handle pattern with a 1378.04 buy point, rising 1.7% to 1383 after reaching 1394 intraday. 
You can see a detailed annotation[1] of the base on its daily and weekly charts at IBD Leaderboard, accessible via 
the home page of Investors.com. Leaderboard, which highlights top-rated companies showing outstanding 
fundamentals and excellent price-and-volume stock action, is currently at 11 names. In the stock market today[2], 
the Nasdaq composite rolled 1.1% higher, trailing a nearly 1.9% advance for Germany's DAX benchmark and a 
1.3% lift for the FTSE 100. The Euro Stoxx 50 jumped 2%. The S...00 and the Dow Jones industrial average rallied 
nearly 0.9% each, on track for their best single-session gains in nearly four weeks. Volume was initially running 
sharply higher on both exchanges but later cooled to be about flat vs. the same time the previous day. Priceline 
showed sloppy action in the beginning of this year and was plagued by heavy selling after its former CEO Darren 
Huston abruptly resigned on April 28 after an internal investigation discovered he had had an inappropriate 
relationship with an employee. A week later, the stock tanked on a weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue 
outlook. However, the shares certainly have their institutional supporters. A-rated mutual fund giant Fidelity 
Contrafund (FCNTX) upped its stake in the company by nearly 7% to almost 822,000 shares, according to analysis 
from William O'Neil + Co. Fellow travel play Ryanair (RYAAY) rose 1% to 81 after hitting 83.30 intraday. The 
leading European regional discount airline company had broken out of a sloppy cup with handle at 87.04 on May 
31, but it reversed badly within a week. As the stock tries to form a new base, watch to see if the price action calms 
down and Ryanair treads firmly above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages. That, in fact, has been hard for 
the Nasdaq itself to accomplish, as noted in a recent Big Picture column. Leading industry groups in the stock 
market today[3] include newspapers, oil drilling, coal, steel alloy plays, super regional banks, consumer loans and 
investment banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) retook its 50-day moving average in light volume, rising 2% to 64.04. In 
the corporate and investment banking field, the Wall Street powerhouse noted that in Q1 it ranked No. 1 in wallet 
share, not only in North America and Latin America, but also in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region. In 
JPMorgan's Banks-Money Center group, just one name -- Bank of Montreal Quebec (BMO) -- sports a Relative 
Price Strength Rating[4] of 80 or higher out of a maximum 99, currently holding a rating of 83. Bank of Montreal has 
survived several tests of buying support at its 50-day moving average, and a bottoming base[5] has formed with a

65.60 buy point. As seen in Wednesday's Big Picture column[6] and Market Pulse table, the market's current 
outlook was downgraded from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure." This means an investor can still 
buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower given the 
increased intensity of professional selling. The Nasdaq composite saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy 
selling) fall to 3, however, a positive sign for bullish investors. Is your stock is best in class within its industry group 
in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

Jun 22, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) GOL Linhas Aereas 
Inteligentes S.A. GOL[1] posted a decline in air traffic for May 2016. Traffic - measured in revenue passenger 
kilometers (RPK) - stood at 2.80 billion, down 7.8% from 3.04 billion recorded a year ago.Also, on a year-over-year 
basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) was down 6.6% to 3.74 billion mainly because of 
declines of 6.3% and 8.8% in domestic and international capacity, respectively. Likewise, both domestic and 
international RPK in the month deteriorated a respective 7.7% and 8.4%. Also, in May 2016, the carrier witnessed a 
20.8% plunge in passenger count. Meanwhile, the load factor, or percentage of seats filled by passengers, was 
down to 74.9% from 75.8% recorded in May 2015.At the end of the first five months of 2016, RPK was down 9.1% 
while ASK dropped 7.8%. Similarly, load factor for the same period fell 1.0 percentage points. 
Adverse conditions in the Brazilian economy, foreign currency headwinds owing to the strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar against the Brazilian real, lower passenger demand contributed to the declining in performance. Apart the 
aforesaid negatives, the company's near-term results are likely to be hurt by increasing competition from new 
entrants. Ryanair Holdings Plc. RYAAY[2] is on track to start operations in Argentina, which is considered to be a 
market with good potential and low competition as of now. This new entry would challenge Gol Linhas' business in 
the region. Zacks Rank ...ocks to ConsiderGOL Linhas currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other well-ranked 
stocks in the wider airlines sector include SkyWest Inc. SKYW[3] and Air France-KLM SA AFLYY[4] Both 
companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment
