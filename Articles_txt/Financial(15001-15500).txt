Brexit prompts Ryanair application for British AOC

Irish airline Ryanair has applied for a British air operator's certificate (AOC) to keep its small UK domestic service 
operating whatever the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union.
Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive officer, has on several occasions voiced his concerns about a 'hard 
Brexit' scenario, saying it could cause disruption in the aviation industry.
In the event of a 'hard Brexit',the UK will give up full access to the EU's single market in order to have full control 
over its borders. It would also likely mean a withdrawal from the EU customs union and many EU-wide agreements, 
include ones that affect the country’s aviation industry.
As flying rights in the UK are determined by EU-wide agreements and because aviation is not part of the World 
Trade Organisation, in the event of no deal between the EU and the UK, flights in the country are not protected.
"A subsidiary company Ryanair UK filed an application on 21 December last for an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) 
with the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK. This may be required for Ryanair's three UK domestic routes in the event 
of a hard Brexit in March 2019," the airline says in a statement.
Airfinance Journal reported in October that Ryanair’s low-cost rival Wizz Air had applied for a UK AOCin response 
to the country’s decision to leave the EU last June. The Hungarian airline is due to begin operations in the UK in 
March 2018 with several UK-registered aircraft.
The London Luton operating base of Wizz Air Hungary (Wizz Air Hungary) will become a Wizz Air UK operation.

Latin American airline group Viva Air has entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with PDP financing as a 
“bundled package” with China Aircraft Leasing (CALC), the Hong Kong-based lessor says.
The deal covers five Airbus A320ceos, scheduled for delivery between 2018 and 2019.
CALC declines to give details of the "bundled package".
“The transaction marks CALC's foray into Viva Air’s markets of Colombia and Peru, and another important move in 
deepening its presence in Latin America with partnering with Viva Air,” CALC says in a statement.
Mike Poon, chief executive officer of CALC, says: “In recent years, the aviation market in Latin America has 
flourished due to the increase in travel and tourism. Further expansion into this market is part of the wider push of 
our globalisation initiative.”
Viva Air is a Panamanian headquartered group, created by Irelandia Aviation, a low-cost airline developer led by 
Declan Ryan, one of the founders of Ryanair. Irelandia has developed six LCCs around the world: Ryanair, 
Allegiant, Tigerair, Viva Aerobus, VivaColombia and Viva Air Peru, which combined have a fleet of over 420 aircraft 
and have carried more than 1 billion passengers.

increased capacity and improved customer experience. Stobart Air is already Europe’s largest ATR operator, and 
we will benefit greatly from Conor’s experience, contact base and independent advice.”
Stobart Air, which morphed out of Aer Arann, operates up to 860 flights weekly across 43 routes throughout 11 
European countries from bases in the UK and Ireland. The airline employs more than 570 people. Its Irish routes

Dublin-based Stellwagen has named Aengus Whelan as chief commercial officer (CCO), replacing Edward 
Coughlan, sources indicate.
Whelan previously served as the head of trading at Kuwaiti lessor ALAFCO. Prior to that, he served as an executive 
director of aviation finance at Standard Chartered.
Coughlan, Howard Millar, who was previously Ryanair’s chief financial officer, and Edward Hansom all resigned 
from Stellwagen on 4 September, 2017.
The lessor’s chief executive, Douglas Brennan, alleges that Millar, Hansom and Coughlan attempted to divert 
valuable business away from the company in direct conflict with their legal obligations. The trio deny the claims.
Stellwagen was unavailable for comment.

 Passengers have voiced their anger after having to spend the night at Stansted Airport after snow and ice forced 
dozens of Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Up to 300 passengers were waiting in the terminal on Wednesday evening, while images posted on social media 
showed people trying to sleep on seats in the arrivals hall in the early hours of Thursday.
One onlooker said there was "tension" in the terminal as frustrated travellers found themselves facing hours of 
delays "because of a few centimetres of snow".
There were reports of outgoing passengers having to wait for hours to reclaim their luggage after their flights had 
been axed, with some complaining of a "shocking" lack of communication by officials.
Staff are said to have resorted to using pen and paper to communicate with passengers after a hand-written poster 
was put up, pleading: "Please be patient."
Sophia Sleigh was on a New Year's Eve trip to Bulgaria after her Ryanair flight "disappeared" from departure 
screens, leaving her "stranded" at the airport.
She tweeted: "Hundreds of people waiting for baggage from cancelled flights from Stansted Airport! What a 
shambles @Ryanair I feel sorry for the elderly and those with kids. Incredibly stressful and expensive time to travel. 
Next available flights not for DAYS apparently..."
Sleigh said she had waited five hours before being told the flight had been cancelled and she would have to return 
to collect her luggage on Friday.
Airport officials said they would provide beds and blankets for people stuck at the airport, although this was 
disputed by one passenger.
Lucy Weyinmi tweeted: "Definitely no blankets or food or any support for passengers who have been stuck here for 
8 hours plus...."
Dozens Of Ryanair , EasyJet Flights Shelved Following Snow And Ice
She added: "8 hours later, still at #Stansted, waiting to get our luggage back so we can do this all again in 10 hours 
time....Shocking
lack of comms or support from airport or Ryanair..."
Meanwhile arrivals were also hit by long delays.
Joe Allen posted a video of the arrivals lounge packed with people at around 0400 GMT.
He said: "(It is) a little busier than you might expect. Some flights have been delayed up to five hours, the one I am 
waiting for is
currently over five hours delayed and is currently sitting on the tarmac with no staff able to offload it, even though 
it's been due to arrive for five hours which is obviously a little bit frustrating. The tension is quite high, people are 
sleeping here. I guess they have
been here for a while. Not very pleasant because of a few centimetres of snow."
Samir Hussein tweeted: "Stansted Airport a disgrace. Waiting for baggage for 3 hours & still told no idea when it will 
arrive. This follows 4 hour flight delay arriving at Stansted due to small amount of snow. Thousands in the same 
situation in baggage hall."
A London Stansted spokeswoman said on Wednesday: "Due to adverse weather conditions today Ryanair and 
easyjet cancelled a number of flights. There are up to 300 passengers in the terminal waiting to rebook flights.
"Passengers unable to return home are being looked after by Stansted Airport with beds and blankets, and 
additional help for elderly
passengers or those with young children. Free food and drinks have been provided to delayed passengers 
throughout the day.
"All passengers due to travel are advised to check the status of their flights with their airline before travelling to the 
airport."

 Stock prices in London are called to open marginally higher on Thursday, the FTSE 100 looking to build on 
Wednesday's gains as the end of 2017 fast approaches.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 1.52 points higher at 7,622.20 on Thursday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed up 0.4%, or 28.02 points, at 7,620.68 on Wednesday, having hit a new all-time high of 
7,632.71 earlier in Wednesday's session.
The FTSE 250 closed up 0.8%, or 158.97 points, at 20,640.04 on Wednesday, which marked a record high for the 
index of midcap firms.
Amid a quiet day for UK company news, BGEO Group said its real estate subsidiary, m2 Real Estate, has signed its 
first major third-party construction contract, worth USD11.6 million.
m2 has been awarded the contract to construct the shell and core of a new shopping mall and business centre 
located in Tbilisi's Saburtalo district. m2's construction arm plans to carry out construction works over the sixteen 
months following the planned project commencement in January 2018.
Tritax Big Box REIT said it has acquired a national distribution facility at Hickling Road in  Staffordshire, for 
GBP44.3 million, excluding purchaser's costs. The unit is operated and let to Unilever UK.
Purpose-built in 2005 for Unilever and extended in 2012, the facility has a gross internal area of 541,157 square 
feet, extensive parking, and has benefited from significant capital investment.
The property has been acquired with a new 10 year lease, subject to a five yearly upward only rent review indexed 
to the Retail Price Index with a collar and cap in place, Tritax said.

"We are pleased to have acquired our second distribution centre let to the leading globally recognised consumer 
goods company; Unilever. This property plays a key role in Unilever's supply chain and has benefited from 
significant capital investment with a high level of automation," said Colin Godfrey, partner of Tritax.

In UK data released early Thursday, the Confederation of British Industry said Thursday private sector growth 
picked up in the fourth quarter.
According to the latest growth indicator, the balance of firms reporting a rise in output was positive 19%, compared 
with positive 6% in the three months to November. Looking ahead, the CBI said private sector growth is set to 
return to a more moribund pace of positive 4% over the next three months.
"Private sector firms are enjoying healthy activity levels as we approach the year end, but mediocre expectations for 
growth underline the ongoing challenges facing companies," Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said.
"Persistent cost pressures will ensure that inflation remains at a high level, perpetuating the squeeze on household 
spending, particularly impacting consumer-facing firms and retailers," she said.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3444 early Thursday, higher than USD1.3394 at the London equities close on 
Wednesday.
In the US on Wednesday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 0.1%, the 
S&P 500 up 0.1% and Nasdaq Composite closing slightly higher.
In Asia on Thursday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed 
up 0.6%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.7%.
Retail sales in Japan were up a seasonally adjusted 1.9% on month in November, the Ministry of Economy, Trade 
and Industry said on Thursday. This beat forecasts for a gain of 0.7% following the downwardly revised 0.1% 
contraction in October.
On a yearly basis retail sales climbed 2.2%, again topping expectations for a gain of 1.0% following the 0.2% slide 
in the previous month.Sales from large retailers advanced an annual 1.4%, exceeding expectations for a gain of 
1.0% after dipping 0.7% a month earlier.
Meanwhile, industrial production in Japan advanced a seasonally adjusted 0.6% on month in November, which beat 
expectations for an increase of 0.5%. On a yearly basis, industrial production advanced 3.7%, above forecasts of 
3.6% but down from 5.9% in the previous month.
In a quiet economic calendar Thursday there are French housing starts at 0845 GMT, and a UK Finance update on 
lending at 0930 GMT. The US will dominate focus in the afternoon, with jobless figures at 1330 GMT, the Chicago 
purchasing managers index at 1445 GMT, and EIA crude oil stocks at 1600 GMT.

Airline Passengers Forced To Pay For Water During 6-Hour Flight Delay
Airline Passengers Forced To Pay For Water During 6-Hour Flight Delay

Dec 28, 2017( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Wednesday 
flight from London's Stansted Airport to Berlin Schönefeld was delayed more than six hours as Ryanair passengers 
claim they were forced to purchase water or other essentials from the airline. Emily Morris, 24 and her fiance Tom 
Jones, 27, say they paid ($240) £180 for Flight FR145 from Stansted to Berlin, but Ryanair incrementally delayed 
the flight from its original 7:50 a.m. departure to their actual takeoff around 2:15 p.m. The BBC reports[1] that during 
the long on-board wait at Stansted Airport, bad weather kept around 300 passengers cramped and stranded in the 
terminal. 
Ryanair responded that it regretted being forced to cancel a "small number of flights" because of "snow-related 
runway closures". Morris, a geography teacher, told the Cambridge News[2] that everyone on-board the plane 
'started asking questions,' but the airline's de-ice process and other delays continued one after another. Hostesses 
and staff told passengers that giving them basic food and drink necessities was not a possibility without payment. "I 
asked if we could have some water because we'd been there for ages, but I was told we couldn't have anything, 
and we couldn't get off the plane either,' said Morris. "One of the air hostesses said if they gave us anything it would 
come out of their own wages. We couldn't have anything unless we paid for it." Morris called the event an 'absolute 
nightmare' and wished Ryanair had the 'decency' to at least offer their customers free water. She said cabin crew 
were happy to offer food and water for payment simply so they couldn't say they had no supplies on the airplane. In 
a statement to Sun Online, Ryanair responded[3] to the refreshment fiasco. "This flight from London Stansted to 
Berlin (27 Dec) was delayed ahead of take-off due to snow at Stansted. To minimise delay, customers remained on 
board, while awaiting ATC clearance to depart, and the crew opened the bars and served refreshments, before the 
aircraft departed to Berlin. "All affected customers were contacted by email and SMS text message and advised of 
their rebooking options," Ryanair officials said in a statement. "We sincerely apologize to all customers affected by 
these weather cancellations and disruptions, which are entirely beyond our control." Easyjet passengers in the 
same airport were given the option of transferring their flight free of charge or receiving a refund. [ 1]:

Byline: Jack Horgan-Jones
Highlight: The deals, the dramas, the dogfights, the disputes 
Body
Jack Horgan-Jones and Tom Lyons look back on 12 eventful months that saw the banks caught red-handed ripping 
off their customers, Sean FitzPatrick walking free after 127 days on trial, and the unions finally bringing Michael 
O’Leary to heel
This year could never be the landmark year for business and the economy that 2016 was. There was no Brexit, no 
Apple tax case, and no election of Donald Trump. However, the battles that have been prompted by those three 
earthquake events are still being fought, and have been joined by a new set of opportunities and risks.
The economy is performing better - both the real economy, that we all live in, and its shadow, the FDI, export-led 
economy that drives leprechaun economics.
It has been a watershed year for some Irish businesses - Michael O’Leary’s fallibility has been painfully proved for 
Ryanair and its shareholders. There have been hundreds of millions raised for Irish companies on the stock 
markets, while long-running sagas like Shell’s involvement in Corrib have come to an end.
The state has begun to normalise its role in the banking sector, yet still the ghosts of the past haunt the economy in 
the form of the tracker mortgage scandal. In this scandal, as with many of the financial travails we have endured 
since the economy collapsed, it seems like ordinary punters are always first in the line of fire.
The capacity of the Irish political/business cycle to spectacularly misfire - as in the Sean FitzPatrick case - is as 
constant as ever.
As another year beckons, what were the stories that made a difference in 2017?
There are two sides to the Brexit coin. If you’re an estate agent looking to sell office space in the Dublin docklands, 
it’s probably a pretty good thing. For everyone else, it’s bad.
2017: The Year In Business
There has been a steady drumbeat of firms announcing plans to relocate at least some staff here - JP Morgan, 
Barclays and Citi among the jewels in the crown - but recently, the frequency of announcements has slowed. And 
according to a a recent FT survey of Britain’s biggest international banks, there may well be significantly fewer jobs 
moving than originally anticipated. The survey found that just 4,600 jobs - just 6 per cent of the City’s workforce - 
would be leaving London.
If the silver lining looks like it may be diminishing, the storm cloud looks as fierce as ever. Earlier this month, both 
the ESRI and the Central Bank warned that, despite the political fudge on regulatory alignment, Brexit is as serious 
a threat to the economy as ever. A messy Brexit that affects our access to the British market, or one that hurts the 
British economy, could have big impacts on everything from our exporters to our banks. Brexit, we all know, means 
Brexit; but it looks increasingly like it might mean nothing but bad news for Ireland as well.
2017 was always going to be a vital year for the majority state-owned bank. Michael Noonan had marched up to the 
top of the IPO hill several times in 2015 and 2016, only to see his plans torn asunder by, among other things, the 
major political shocks of last year.
However, in the twilight of his career, he wasn’t to be denied his final prize, and the bank and the Department of 
Finance entered 2017 with a sense of purpose.
Noonan wasn’t in office to see the final flotation of the bank, but there’s no doubting who ran the preamble.
The bank has ridden the wave of an improving economy, bringing down its level of non-performing loans. However, 
in 2017 it showed that it also had teeth, selling off a bundle of stricken business and investment debts to Goldman 
Sachs in April.
It has moved on to a mammoth book of debt, Project Redwood, which is currently on the market. A further loan 
sale, which will include deeply distressed family home mortgages for the first time, is slated for 2018.
As for the IPO itself, when it rolled out in June, the well-paid advisers had done their jobs. The offering, priced at 
€4.40, attracted strong interest from investors.
The government sold over 28 per cent of AIB, with the price climbing by 6 per cent in the days following flotation. Of 
course, the bank’s improving share price (it climbed as high as €5.70 earlier this month) means the state has faced 
charges of selling out too soon.
Yes, hell froze over. This year, Michael O’Leary finally recognised trade unions in Ryanair. For decades, he had 
dismissed the need for trade unions in his airline, describing them as “the bearded forces of darkness”.
Now, however, with demand for pilots surging in Europe, the Middle East and on trans-Atlantic routes, O’Leary has 
finally been brought to the table. It was that or face a series of rolling strikes at Christmas in multiple countries 
including Ireland, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. After the pilots’ victory came the cabin crew.
Management guru Stefan Stern said: “This is not simply a U-turn by O’Leary: it is a full loop-the-loop aerial 
extravaganza, with multicoloured vapour trails and a brass band playing in celebratory support.”
But while trade unions will undoubtedly push up costs for Ryanair, it remains a powerful airline with a huge cash 
pile. It was said that O’Leary would never bow to demands from consumers for better service. He did, and Ryanair 
came out stronger. Now he has bowed to the trade unions. This is a setback for the airline’s cost base, albeit a 
good move for staff, but it is not time to bet against Ryanair just yet.
The tracker mortgage rate scandal marks yet another ugly moment in Irish banking. Despite helping to bankrupt the 
country and requiring a bailout in the billions, the culture of impunity in Irish banking appears to have changed little.
Thousands of mortgage holders were switched by banks from low interest rate trackers to fixed rate, variable rate or 
higher rate trackers.
2017: The Year In Business
The move allowed the banks to make more money at the expense of mortgage holders who ended up paying 
thousands more. This led to some mortgage holders losing their homes when they were unable to keep up with 
payments. The Central Bank first launched an industry-wide examination of tracker mortgages in 2015.
After identifying impacted mortgage holders, it has moved to compensate them and switch them back to their 
original rates. The question now is whether the individual bankers who approved treating mortgage holders in this 
manner will be held to account.
Finally, after a 127-day trial, it was all over for former Anglo Irish Bank chairman Sean FitzPatrick. On May 24, he 
was formally acquitted in front of a jury on multiple charges that he misled the bank’s auditors EY (then Ernst & 
Young) about the extent of multimillion-euro loans connected to him from 2002 to 2007.
The case against FitzPatrick was run in a cack-handed and disgraceful manner by the state. Potentially relevant 
evidence was shredded in panic by solicitor Kevin O’Connell of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement 
(ODCE), and key witnesses were coached in the preparation of their statements.
Evidence also emerged that the ODCE failed to look for evidence that might show FitzPatrick’s innocence as well 
as potential guilt.
Minister for Business Heather Humphreys has said she plans to scrap the ODCE in order to set up an independent 
agency with “the right skill set”. The state also plans to publish a report into the failings of the ODCE including its 
requests for additional gardaí and experts. Almost a decade after the collapse, it is all a bit late in the day.
In March, the developer David Daly published a report that concluded that Nama had significantly undersold 
properties in its portfolio, causing the taxpayer to miss out on a staggering €18 billion.
The straight-talking developer concluded: “Nama is projecting a surplus of up to €2.3 billion - an uplift of 7.23 per 
cent - in 11 years. This is a risible return on investment. Any bank or investor would laugh you out the door if you 
were to offer such a paltry return on €31.8 billion.”
Daly stung Nama into a lengthy response criticising his conclusions and pointing out some minor inaccuracies. “It is 
important to bear in mind that the agency was set a very difficult job to do, which included meeting specific debt 
repayment targets — all of which have been met,” Nama said.
Both Nama and Daly - with the benefit of hindsight - are right and wrong. Daly is right that Nama sold too much to 
the vulture funds and failed to prepare for the housing crisis. However, Nama is right that it was under huge 
pressure from the government and Europe to sell. Daly’s privately funded report sparked a much-needed public 
interest debate that remains relevant.
The Paradise Papers, based on 13.4 million confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investments, 
were published in November. Some 380 journalists from 96 media organisations across 67 countries worked on the 
project including the New York Times, Le Monde and the Irish Times. The project revealed the complex ways in 
which wealthy people and companies use offshore arrangements to manage their financial affairs.
U2 frontman Bono’s investment in a Lithuanian shopping centre via a Malta-based company with a stop-off in 
Guernsey was the Irish story that attracted most interest. Bono said he was a passive investor in the shopping 
centre, and that he had been assured everything was tax-compliant. “The fact is, I welcome this reporting. It 
shouldn’t take leaks to understand what’s going on where,” he said. There should be public registries so that the 
press and public can see what governments, like Guernsey, already know.”
The leaks, which detailed thousands of different deals, led to a formal inquiry in Australia, a review in Britain of Vat 
schemes on the Isle of Man, and calls by European leaders for better laws. Not everyone agreed. Appleby, a law 
firm caught up in the leaks, is taking a legal action against the Guardian and the BBC.
Gerard Ryle, the director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which coordinated the 
Paradise Papers project, described the legal challenge as “a potentially dangerous moment for free expression in 
2017: The Year In Business
Britain”. In an interview with The Sunday Business Post in December, the Kerry-born journalist said he would find it 
hard to work in Ireland because of its “pretty draconian” libel and defamation laws.
Even after more than 900 days and many millions of euro, the IBRC Commission remains a long way from finishing 
its first module examining one transaction, the sale of Siteserv to Denis O’Brien. It has another 37 transactions to 
look at after that, plus interest rates, and anything deemed to be of public interest. It now expects to finish its first 
module some time next year.
If it looks at other transactions after that, it will be many years before the Commission finishes. The cost of the 
Commission was originally estimated at €4 million, but it will end up costing a significant multiple of that.
This year, the IBRC Commission successfully injuncted The Sunday Business Post from reporting on various 
matters. Its legal move came after we published a 12,500-word article setting out what we think happened with 
Siteserv in forensic detail. Let’s hope 2018 is the year the Commission follows our lead and comes to some sort of 
conclusion.
It was all getting a bit quiet down on Dame Street during 2016, with that year’s only IPO of note being a minor 
enough €102 million cash call from venture capital fund Draper Esprit. When combined with a downward IPO trend 
in the rest of Europe, you could have been forgiven for thinking that the age of the IPO was coming to an end, and 
that the Reit flotations had been a one-off blip.
However, there were several significant Irish IPOs in 2017. One of the most interesting - and long awaited - floats 
occurred far from Irish shores, with the $300 million IPO of a portion of metal and glass packaging giant Ardagh.
Closer to home, AIB stole the show as not just the biggest Irish IPO, but also one of the largest European IPOs this 
year. Greencoat Renewables raised a considerable €270 million for its play on the Irish wind energy sector, which 
may eventually take in other markets.
Property, an asset class never far from the collective Irish financial hive mind, also saw yet another publicly quoted 
vehicle arrive in 2017 with the flotation of Glenveagh Properties. The company, which is led by the triumvirate of 
Justin Bickle, John Mulcahy and Stephen Garvey, raised a hefty €550 million in October and will compete with 
fellow Iseq dweller Cairn Homes for primacy in the house building stakes.
Who knew a massive server farm in the middle of nowhere could be so important? The fact of the matter is that 
data centres are not the second coming of the FDI messiah: they won’t employ as many people on good wages as 
pharma, or the army of yuppies who work in Silicon Docks. These enormous, featureless buildings consume huge 
amounts of electricity and, in return, provide a few full-time jobs - with a lot more during the construction phase.
So why do they matter? Well, it’s simple - they’re the most wanted item on the FDI shopping list. As parts of the 
economy increasingly begin to digitise, companies need to store and administer the physical infrastructure needed 
to manage this massive task. Ireland, with its high levels of renewable penetration (good for branding) and climate 
(handy on the cooling bills), was top of the list.
However, the Apple data centre in Athenry became a lightning-rod issue for some, with the Irish planning system 
used to its fullest extent against the plan. The data centre is now seen as unlikely to proceed, with Ireland being 
compared unfavourably with other jurisdictions where data centres were announced at the same time and will 
shortly come online.
The problem is that the data centre issue undermines the central premise of our industrial policy: that Ireland will 
deliver for FDI. The government has signalled that it will ‘do something’ about the planning system for these 
projects - but any reforms will surely themselves become a battleground. This isn’t an issue that is going to go away 
in 2018.
Remember when you got in trouble in school? Wasn’t it always better when someone else was in trouble at the 
same time? After the European Commission’s €13 billion levy of Irish back taxes on Apple, Ireland and the US 
2017: The Year In Business
computing giant were the bad boys of international tax planning; but at least they were in it together, backing each 
other up - the same language, the same arguments.
However, close watchers of the relationship detected a definite change in tone towards the end of the year. 
Following EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s decision to sue Ireland over the lack of movement 
on getting the aforementioned billions into an escrow account, there was Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s visit to 
California in November, with no announcement on the aforementioned Apple data centre.
Frustrations grew at official level about Apple’s foot-dragging on the escrow issue, and Varadkar told the Dáil that 
he didn’t want to have to take the company to court on the issue - a thunderbolt statement from the head of the 
government to one of the country’s most important FDI companies. Shortly afterwards, an agreement was struck on 
the escrow account, but as the sands of international tax and competition shift, this will be a relationship that is 
under continuing scrutiny.
Let’s be serious for a second. On nearly every measure, the Irish economy is getting better. Median wages are 
among the highest in Europe; wage growth is the strongest in the block; disposable incomes are growing; income 
inequality, according to our gini coefficient, is stable; deprivation is on the way down.
However, things aren’t as rosy as might be suggested by the most commonly used economic indicator - gross 
domestic product (GDP).
Year on year, our economy grew by 10.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2017. This is, of course, nonsense, with 
statistical noise introduced by our FDI sector churning up a false picture of how the economy is performing.
So it isn’t all good news: while the recovery seems finally to be losing some of its two-speed nature, permitting 
spending to increase, there are - as always - risks. The overexposure of the exchequer to just a few corporate 
taxpayers - especially as US tax reform gets into gear - is one.
Brexit has not hit the British economy that hard yet, meaning that British consumers are still in a reasonably good 
position to buy Irish goods. But the political fiasco underpinning the ideological crusade for freedom from the 
tyrannous EU is so utterly volatile that nothing can be relied upon, save for a worse situation for Irish businesses 
after Britain leaves than what preceded it.
Homelessness, rough sleeping and the malfunctioning housing market remain a national stain, while our enormous 
personal and national debts continue to follow us around like a spectre, and volatility in the tax take needs to be 
closely monitored.
But objectively, it is a happier Christmas for many Irish households than it has been for the guts of a decade. Enjoy 
it while it lasts.
Irish business has got used to being disappointed at budget time in recent years. Aside from broad brush-strokes 
like the 9 per cent Vat rate for the hospitality sector, the finessing and targeted policies that the business lobby had 
asked for were largely left to one side, as recent governments focused much of their firepower on the gradual 
easing of austerity measures.
Frances Fitzgerald may have been haunted by the ghosts of past ministerial postings, but her first (and only) foray 
into the budget at the head of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation was privately warmly 
welcomed. It delivered items of long standing on the business wish-list, such as KEEP, the share options scheme 
(it’s not massive, but now it’s there) and a low interest €300 million loan scheme for Brexit-hit businesses. There 
were the usual increases in capital budgets for IDA and Enterprise Ireland, and a doubling of Brexit-related staff for 
the agencies as well.
Fitzgerald also applied to Europe for clearance on a Brexit ‘rescue and restructure’ scheme to provide emergency 
financial assistance for businesses of up to €10 million. Sadly for her, she wasn’t in situ when sign-off arrived from 
2017: The Year In Business
Brussels this month. However, the legacy of these programmes is likely to be very important to stricken businesses 
as Brexit begins to bite.

Body
Leo Varadkar
Leo Varadkar’s elevation caught attention internationally in a way that didn’t happen at home: the country that 
introduced same sex marriage only two years earlier was not going to make a fuss about the election of our first gay 
taoiseach. We were too cool for that. Nor did we want to be seen to be making an issue of the fact that his father 
was Indian. And so what that he’s relatively young and inexperienced, when he can be compared in looks and 
vitality to Trudeau in Canada and Macron in France?
It is no surprise that Varadkar has sought to hang out with both of these leaders. His concentration on the media 
message has been widely mocked, but it is easy to see why he is doing it. His predecessor Enda Kenny failed to 
convince people of his many achievements and allowed the agenda to be hijacked by media-savvy opponents, so 
that Kenny was more often reactive rather than proactive.
Varadkar is also a touch unpredictable and a bit less politically savvy, at least in the conventional sense. His 
defence of Frances Fitzgerald seemed naive and brought us unnecessarily to the brink of an election earlier this 
month but, in combination with Simon Coveney and the backstage officials, he has done as well in representing 
Irish interests in the EU-Britain Brexit negotiations as could have been hoped.
Let’s not forget the coordinated and almost effortless manner in which Varadkar stitched up the Fine Gael 
leadership contest before Coveney seemed to realise what was happening. The media may have lampooned his 
“get up early in the morning” approach as right-wing and heartless, but it may play well with the sort of audience he 
is after. Meanwhile, he seems to be taking on Sinn Féin not because he opposes its 32-county aspiration, but 
because he apparently wants to own it. As Sinn Féin plays to political correctness in its electoral strategy, the 
populist Varadkar may see political advantage in being the centre-right party that is strongly nationalist.

[caption id="attachment_405628" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Michael O’Leary: the Ryanair chief executive 
will leave the company at a time of his choosing[/caption]
Arguably the most successful Irish businessman ever, O’Leary had a rotten 2017, culminating in him bowing to the 
demands of his Ryanair employees (and myriad contractors) for negotiations over pay and conditions to be 
conducted via their unions - something he had sworn would never, ever happen. He had said he’d close the airline 
first. But that was many years ago. O’Leary has rarely been given the credit he deserves for how he has grown 
Ryanair, in just over a quarter of a century, into the world’s fourth-largest airline, producing expected annual profits 
in the range of €1.4 billion and flying 130 million passengers this financial year (ending March 2018). To have done 
so from Ireland is an extraordinary achievement, no matter how much people crib about his penny-pinching and, up 
to 2013 at least, disdain for customer service.
His in-your-face approach to customer care and union relations has alienated many, however, and his countless 
critics are now greatly enjoying the discomfort he has suffered this year, after mass cancellations caused by a pilot 
roster foul-up. Years ago, O’Leary provided a one-word answer when he was asked how he kept his employees 
happy and motivated: fear. He is not so glib now.
His ego will demand that he remains as chief executive for the foreseeable future – as much as the realisation that 
anything else he does in business is unlikely to match what he has done at Ryanair for adrenalin and achievement. 
He is only likely to leave when he wants – his contract runs to 2019 – because the board remains packed with long-
standing supporters. But he may not find it as much fun any more.
As often happens, once Enda Kenny was out of the line of fire, he was instantly more warmly regarded by many of 
those who were once critical. The “history will be kind” line is trotted out more regularly, as greater weight is given to 
consideration of the debacle he inherited. Of course, he made mistakes – who doesn’t? – but he will be 
remembered as the man who oversaw the genesis of the economic recovery that has now taken hold and the 
restoration of national economic sovereignty with the departure of the controlling foreign troika. He was a good 
international salesman too for the country, often treated with more respect abroad than he was at home.
But as 2017 moved on, Kenny was remembered largely only for the purposes of comparison with Varadkar. He 
would not have allowed the Frances Fitzgerald crisis to develop, it was said, his political nous ensuring that it would 
have been sorted far earlier with an earlier sacrifice of her on the altar of political expediency. But it was said, 
although there is no way of knowing, that he might not have displayed the unpredictability that brought the British to 
heel seemingly over the border issue in its EU talks. Which is all largely irrelevant, now that he’s gone.
[caption id="attachment_405629" align="alignleft" width="324"] Christy Kinahan[/caption]
The alleged drug smuggler and distributor does not feature on any of the risible rich lists that appear in other 
publications – with their estimates of assets and seeming disregard for liabilities – but if the crime correspondents 
are to be believed, then he is one of the richest Irish-born businessmen in operation. His business is illegal and 
untaxed, of course, according to the reports. We are told that it is supported by violence and even murder.
It is run from abroad, but his family’s feud – as it is called – with the Hutches, another alleged crime family, has 
eaten up much media coverage over the last year (not to mention Garda resources). The authorities claim that they 
have prevented a large number of additional murders, but they have not always been successful. The Gardaí have 
conducted many raids of those suspected of money laundering and have confiscated cash and assets. The 
suggestion is that the illegal network has been damaged and that Kinahan’s influence is waning.
Whatever the case, somebody is supplying large amounts of cocaine in Ireland these days to all sorts of users. The 
anecdotal evidence is that use of the drug in social settings is returning to the days of the worst excesses of the 
Celtic Tiger. I believe that because I have witnessed personal behaviour by many people in recent weeks that can 
only be attributed to cocaine use – and it is not just among young people, but older professionals and 
businesspeople too. It all raises interesting questions about the ethics and morality of those using the drugs for so 
called recreational purposes when the suppliers are engaged in such wanton criminality.

[caption id="attachment_405630" align="alignleft" width="1024"] Nóirín O’Sullivan’s departure as Garda 
Commissioner was met largely with a shrug[/caption]
Whatever about the successes it has claimed in apparently negating the worst excesses of the Kinahan/Hutch feud, 
it was a rotten year for public confidence in An Garda Síochána.
While we await further hearings of the Charleton Tribunal – and its final report into the conspiracy to destroy the 
reputation of whistleblower Maurice McCabe and thereby distort analysis of the facts – the damage has already 
been largely done. Any protests that the Gardaí don’t look after those in the know when it comes to sorting out 
penalty points were ruined by the revelation that up to two million fake breath tests were logged into the force’s 
computer system. Nobody is to be blamed or reprimanded because the investigation is beyond anyone’s ability.
Nóirín O’Sullivan departed as commissioner during the year, an early retiree who’d had enough. The fanfare about 
her initial promotion was ridiculous, because it overlooked that she was a key part of the regime of predecessor 
Martin Callinan. Her departure was met largely with a shrug, but she faces a difficult time at the forthcoming 
Charleton hearings: just what strategy did she personally authorise for lawyers previously representing the force at 
a previous commission? Was she being two-faced in her approach? More importantly, however, how dysfunctional 
a force will the new commissioner have to repair?
[caption id="attachment_405631" align="alignleft" width="1024"] Conor McGregor’s defeat to Floyd Mayweather in 
August reaped him some €140 million[/caption]
The Crumlin native fought in just one professional bout in 2017 – there have been reports of a bar-room brawl too, 
involving relatives of criminals who aren’t to be messed with – but it has been suggested that the TV rights alone for 
his predictable and heavily-hyped defeat to Floyd Mayweather in August paid him about €140 million. He implied as 
much at a recent court hearing to face a road traffic offence summons. Obviously, others have to be paid out of that 
– agents, trainers, sparring partners and whatever – and there will be a sizeable tax bill too, but what’s often 
overlooked is that McGregor has showed a certain cunning as a businessman.
He knows his value and negotiates accordingly. He is not shy to leverage his brand either, appearing in a variety of 
advertising campaigns and promising to launch his own whiskey (even if spelt incorrectly, as if Scotch). If he fights 
again, it can be for another small fortune.
However, McGregor is in serious danger of damaging his own brand. While his recent over-the-top behaviour – 
regarded by many as outrageous - in the run-up to the Mayweather fight may have been a shrewd marketing ploy, 
since then he has said and done things that suggest he is being swept by the fame into difficult and dangerous 
places.
The premature death of Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Martin McGuinness was of historical significance, as well as 
creating an immediate political issue to be resolved. McGuinness arguably had done more than any other IRA man 
to win unionists over to a peaceful settlement in the six counties.
He had won their trust despite, perhaps even because of, his crimes.
His funeral was a remarkable event in Derry, attended even by Arlene Foster of the DUP, with whom he had not 
replicated his previous warm relationships with her predecessors Peter Robinson and Ian Paisley.
The latter’s son – later in the year one of the most provocative pro-Brexit voices – paid remarkable and graceful 
tribute to McGuinness. But his graveside burial was used for political purposes, with Mary Lou McDonald and 
Michelle O’Neill alongside Gerry Adams for the graveside oration.
The announcement that Adams was stepping down as leader of Sinn Féin after 35 years met with a muted 
response. The deification in republican circles continued apace – remarkable for a man who claims that he never 
fired a shot or ordered a bombing as a commander of the IRA – but most other people saw a leader who had held 
on too long, and who wasn’t going to get the opportunity to enter government in the South. Unless, of course, Mary 
Power brokers and pub brawlers
Lou McDonald leads Sinn Féin into coalition and then demands a post for her mentor. He might run for the 
presidency in 2018, but could his ego deal with defeat?
Between the “cash for ash” scandal and the DUP’s acceptance in 2016 of hundreds of thousands of pounds from 
mysterious quarters to fund a special newspaper Brexit publication just before the referendum, money is never far 
away from a mention when it comes to Arlene Foster, the North’s former first minister (although she often behaves 
as if she still has the job).
Although she is not an MP, her party holds the balance of power at Westminster and the prospect of a £1 billion 
annual bounty to keep the Tories in power has pleased her greatly.
That’s easily understood, but less so is the absence of pragmatism when it comes to the place of the North in the 
single market and the customs union. Foster and the DUP have been fooled by the ideology of the hard-Brexiteers 
into thinking that Britain will do better by their destructive means.
Notwithstanding that a majority of Northern voters wanted to remain in the European Union, Foster could use her 
votes in Westminster to help bring about the soft Brexit that would be in her people’s interests. It is a sad and 
grievous miscalculation that does her no credit.
[caption id="attachment_405632" align="alignleft" width="1024"] Catherine Noone[/caption]
The Mayo-born senator, a failed running-mate of Leo Varadkar’s in the last general election, was handed the 
poisoned chalice of chairing the Oireachtas committee on the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, the one that 
deals with abortion and the right to life of the unborn. Given the passions this topic provokes, it was a terrible task to 
have to take. But Noone did an outstanding job and a more prominent political career might follow as a result. She 
was scrupulously fair, despite the antics of men who would follow her into the toilets to complain that they weren’t 
getting a fair hearing. She heard all points of view, and it wasn’t her fault if some people chose not to turn up to give 
evidence.
The British prime minister has been castigated for calling an unwanted and seemingly unnecessary general election 
that cost her Tory party its majority. It has left her government dependent on the DUP to survive and, even then, it 
lost one of the first key Brexit votes for lack of internal support. That, in itself, may explain why May sought to gain a 
bigger majority over Labour, to give her leeway to win votes in the event of backbench, or even cabinet, rebellions.
May has been derided and her imminent departure from office has been predicted many times since the summer. 
She seems to be talking tough at home, but then she bows to pretty much whatever the EU and Ireland say has to 
happen on the Brexit talks. Nonetheless, she may remain in power for quite some time, because her job is one that 
few of her rivals actually want. Who in the British government wants to play its terrible hand in the negotiations on 
trade in the second part of Brexit?
The former Labour Party leader and tánaiste has been the victim of fake news over the last year. Many of her critics 
alleged that she had been responsible personally for the failed prosecution of the anti-water charge protesters at 
the now infamous Jobstown protest of late 2014. But she wasn’t the one who pressed the charges, or who botched 
the prosecution. She was merely a witness who gave her truthful version of events.
Paul Murphy of the Socialist Party was overjoyed by his acquittal – the charges he faced were excessive and 
should never have been brought – but it doesn’t seem to have delivered much of a political dividend to his 
movement, at least if the opinion polls are to be believed. As the economy picks up, his day in the sun may have 
passed.
Meanwhile, Burton may never recover office, but she can reflect that many of the deeply unpopular measures she 
had to introduce or oversee have made a more positive contribution than her critics will allow.
In truth, enough has already been said about this man-baby of a president and his tantrum-filled year. But his 
country deserves better.

Ryanair hit with first ever pilots strike
Ryanair hit with first ever pilots strike

Ryanair's efforts to avert its first ever pilots strike collapsed on Friday as pilots in Germany held a four-hour walkout 
although airports said there had been little impact on flights.
The Irish budget carrier had sought to avert a series of threatened strikes across Europe over Christmas last week 
by giving up its long-held opposition to recognising unions.
However, Germany's Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) union said it would stage a brief walkout as it did not believe 
Ryanair was serious about recognising unions or sincere in talks.
"This was a warning shot and we started small. However, there is potential for much more," union spokesman 
Markus Wahl said, ruling out further strikes until after Dec 26.
The strike ran from 0401 GMT to 0759 GMT when only 16 flights were scheduled.
"All in all there are no significant effects," a spokesman for Berlin airports said, noting that five of seven flights had 
departed, with one delayed.
Cologne/Bonn airport said two of three scheduled flights had taken off and the third was delayed. Frankfurt airport 
said four of six scheduled flights had taken off.
Ryanair was not available for immediate comment. Management had urged pilots to work to get passengers home 
for Christmas.
Ryanair hit with first ever pilots strike
But the VC union said after a first meeting that it did not believe Ryanair genuinely wanted to recognise unions and 
said it wanted to send a message that their pilots were serious about industrial action.
VC said Ryanair had refused to accept two members of a delegation that the union nominated to hold talks with 
management. One of the pilots was a contractor and one a direct employee, but Ryanair has ended both of their 
contracts, VC said.
"This has shown us that nothing has changed with Ryanair's management style or how it handles workers' rights," 
VC President Ilja Schulz told reporters on Thursday.
Ryanair pilots mobilised in September after the carrier announced the cancellation of around 20,000 flights, which it 
blamed on a rostering problem sparked by a change in Irish regulations. (Reuters)

BRITS face the busiest day of the year for travelling on the nation's roads today, at the start of a festive period 
stacked with transport troubles including rail strikes and numerous station closures.
The RAC has warned drivers against travelling today where possible, with last-day commuters mixing with an 
expected 1.25m leisure trips.
It comes as petrol prices jump to their highest mark this year, averaging 120.56p a litre across the UK, according to 
Experian Catalist data.
Gatwick has also said today will be its busiest of 2017 for flights, with 67,000 passengers expected to jet off.
The RAC warned that rail strikes will also serve to drive more cars onto the roads over the Christmas-New Year 
holiday, threatening to cause a miserable festive period for those travelling to visit family and friends.
Walkouts by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union are planned for 27 December on Greater 
Anglia, and New Year's Eve on South Western Railway in rows over the role of the guard.
A strike by workers on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is also set for New Year's Eve, over a breakdown in 
industrial relations.
Greater Anglia has a revised Christmas service in place for 27 December due to engineering works.

Further gloom is on the way in January after more strikes were announced this week. Walkouts are planned for 
Northern, Merseyrail, Greater Anglia, South Western Railway and the Isle of Wight's Island Line on the 8, 10 and 12 
January. Southern rail will also face a one-day strike on the 8 January.
Meanwhile, Ryanair pilots in Germany strike for four hours this morning after negotiations stalled.
The one bright spot was news yesterday that strikes planned on Virgin West Coast have been called off by the 
Transport Salaried Staffs' Association and the RMT, including one set that had been scheduled for today.
The batch of strikes coincide with a period of significant upgrade work on more than 260 projects by Network Rail, 
causing a raft of station closures and further travel disruption over Christmas.
London Bridge, Charing Cross, Cannon Street and Waterloo East are facing closures, while services will not run 
between Blackfriars and St Pancras International from 23 December to 1 January for Thameslink programme work.
Meanwhile, London Paddington will be closed from 24 December to 27 December, with an amended service in 
place from 28 December to 1 January, as Elizabeth Line preparation gets underway.
Crossrail work will also close the London end of the Great Eastern main line from 23 December to 1 January, and 
half of the lines from London Victoria to Brighton will be closed from 24 December to 1 January with Victoria station 
shut on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

BERLIN (AP) - A four-hour strike called by a pilots' union in Germany at Ryanair has prompted delays, but the 
budget airline didn't have to cancel any flights.
The Cockpit union had called on Ryanair pilots in Germany to strike from 5:01 a.m. to 8:59 a.m. local time Friday 
(0401 to 0759 GMT). It accused the airline of staging a "publicity stunt" when it offered last week to negotiate on 
pay and working conditions.
Ryanair said nine out of 36 flights were delayed but there were no cancellations. It said in a statement that it was 
grateful to pilots for "largely ignoring" the strike.
Cockpit spokesman Markus Wahl told n-tv television the union was satisfied with pilots' participation, asserting that 
Ryanair replaced contract pilots with non-permanent employees or foreign pilots.

Dec 22, 2017( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair failed to avert its first 
ever pilots strike on Friday as pilots in Germany held a four-hour walkout although airports and the Irish budget 
carrier said there had been little impact on flights. Ryanair had sought to avert a series of threatened strikes across 
Europe over Christmas by giving up its long-held opposition to recognizing unions. 
That convinced pilots in Ireland, Italy and Portugal to call off planned strikes. However, Germany's Vereinigung 
Cockpit (VC) union staged a brief walkout saying it did not believe Ryanair was serious about negotiating with 
unions. "This was a warning shot and we started small. However, there is potential for much more," union 
spokesman Markus Wahl said, ruling out further strikes until after Dec 26. The strike ran from 0401 GMT to 0759 
GMT when only 16 flights were scheduled. Ryanair, which had urged pilots to work to get passengers home for 
Christmas, said 9 of its 36 early flights from Germany were delayed. There were no cancellations and it expected to 
operate all scheduled flights on Friday. Ryanair shares were down 0.6 percent at 0941 GMT. "We are grateful to all 
of our Ryanair pilots for putting our customers first and largely ignoring this VC strike," the airline said in a 
statement. A spokesman for Berlin airports said there were no significant effects, noting that five of seven early 
flights had departed, with one delayed. Cologne/Bonn airport said two of three scheduled flights had taken off and 
the third was delayed. Frankfurt airport said four of six scheduled flights had taken off. The VC union said after a 
first meeting that it did not believe Ryanair genuinely wanted to recognize unions and said it wanted to send a 
message that their pilots were serious about industrial action. VC said Ryanair had refused to accept two members 
of a delegation that the union nominated to hold talks with management. One of the pilots was a contractor and one 
a direct employee, but Ryanair has ended both of their contracts, VC said. "This has shown us that nothing has 
changed with Ryanair's management style or how it handles workers' rights," VC President Ilja Schulz told reporters 
on Thursday. Ryanair pilots mobilized in September after the carrier announced the cancellation of around 20,000 
flights, which it blamed on a rostering problem sparked by a change in Irish regulations. Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary told Reuters this week that his offer of union recognition was genuine but that employees must understand 
it will remain a low cost airline. Negotiations with unions will continue in the new year.

BERLIN (AP) - A German union has called on Ryanair pilots to walk off the job Friday morning, accusing the airline 
of staging a "publicity stunt" when offering to hold negotiations on pay and working conditions.
In a statement Thursday, the Cockpit union called on pilots to strike from 5:01 a.m. to 8:59 a.m. local time (0401 to 
0759 GMT) at German airports.
The strike call comes a day after Ryanair called off an opening round of talks at short notice on the grounds that it 
rejected two of the five union negotiators taking part, according to the union. Ryanair said it objected to the inclusion 
of a former Ryanair pilot who is in litigation with the company.
Cockpit official Ingolf Schumacher said that suggested "the company is not interested in a mutually constructive 
cooperation."
Following the strike call, Ryanair said it wrote to German pilots asking them to work as normal, and that it intends to 
continue talks. The airline said last week it was reversing its longstanding refusal to recognize pilots' unions as it 
worked to avert strikes in several European countries over the busy Christmas season.
The airline said in a statement that the planned walkout is "unjustified and unnecessary" and that it had written to 
the union agreeing to meet again in Frankfurt Jan. 5. It said it had written to German pilots asking them to work as 
normal Friday and that it planned to operate all scheduled flights.

Former Formula One champion and entrepreneur Niki Lauda is one of the four parties who has placed a bid for Niki 
airline, Air Berlin's insolvent subsidiary, his spokeswoman said on Thursday.
The other bidding parties were Tuifly, travel group Thomas Cook and British Airways parent company IAG,

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair and the German freight company Zeitfracht announced that they would not place bids 
of their own, despite signalling earlier that they were interested in the Austria-based carrier.
However, Zeitfracht, as well as German aircraft service firm Nayak, said they would like to cooperate with Niki's

Niki Lauda had founded the airline under his name in 2003 but sold it to now-insolvent Air Berlin in 2011.
The Austrian airline with around 1,000 employees was deemed a particularly lucrative part of the Air Berlin

Earlier this month, major aviation industry player Lufthansa pulled out of a potential purchase of Niki after the 
European Commission signalled it might object due to concerns over a monopoly.
The Vienna-based Niki mainly served European and North African vacation destinations.

RYANAIR yesterday was called to answer MPs' questions after two Select Committees wrote to the airline's boss 
Michael O'Leary saying they plan to investigate allegations regarding working conditions at the carrier.
The investigation comes off the back of reports saying agency cabin crew face costs of "at least" £2,150 for training 
and £25 per month for uniform in the first year. It was also alleged that cabin crew would have a £175 
"administration cost" taken from salaries if they left in the first 15 months of employment.
Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, and Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy 
and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the airline must provide answers by 8 January on the fees and charges 
faced by cabin staff, and explain how they ensure staff receive the national minimum wage.
Reeves said there appeared to be evidence of the airline "trying to wiggle out of its basic responsibility to pay its 
workers the national minimum wage".
Ryanair said in a statement: "We will respond in early January as requested."

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday he was serious about his decision to recognize trade 
unions, but the airline would retain the right to move planes to different countries if unions made unreasonable 
demands.
Ryanair shocked investors on Friday by recognizing trade unions for the first time in 32-years to try to avoid its first-
ever strike later that day.
"The unions want to know there isn't some kind of curveball. There isn't," O'Leary told Reuters in an interview hours 
ahead of his airline's first meeting with Ireland's pilot union.
"But if someone is being unreasonable and we are being completely messed around by a union, we will still move 
aircraft away from that base or country," he said. "That's not the plan. The plan is to work with unions."
Ryanair will move on to meetings with cabin crew unions "in due course," it said on Tuesday, following its surprise 
shift to talk with pilot unions and after criticism from a German cabin crew union.
The carrier has agreed to first meetings with pilot unions from Ireland, Portugal and Germany this week.
"It will lead on in the New Year to meetings with other EU pilot unions and cabin crew unions in due course as well," 
Ryanair said in an emailed statement.
Earlier, German cabin crew union UFO said it had asked Ryanair for negotiations on pay and conditions in October, 
but the carrier refused.

"Workers' rights should not stop at the cockpit door," Nicoley Baublies, UFO board member for pay policy said in a 
statement on Tuesday, adding cabin crew would also consider industrial action if Ryanair did not negotiate with 
them too. (Reuters)

BERLIN (AP) - A German union representing flight attendants criticized budget carrier Ryanair on Tuesday, saying 
the airline was refusing to meet with them to discuss pay and conditions.
The UFO union said it was reaching out to the European Cabin Crew Association to determine how to increase 
pressure on Ryanair.
The airline reversed its longstanding refusal to recognize pilots' unions last week, saying it had invited several for 
talks because it wished to "avoid any threat of disruption to its customers and its flights from pilot unions during 
Christmas week."
UFO chairman Alexander Behrens welcomed Ryanair's willingness to talk to pilots, but warned it could be an 
attempt to avert strikes in several European countries over the busy Christmas season.
Behrens claimed flight attendants' pay is only marginally above minimum wage and accused the airline of breaching 
employment law. The union called on Ryanair to talk to flight attendants' representatives too.
Following Behrens remarks, Ryanair issued a statement and said it was just "starting" negotiations with pilot unions 
and that it expected those talks would "lead on in the new year to meetings with other EU pilot unions and cabin 
crew unions as well."

UK SHARES rose yesterday at a slightly lower pace than European peers as London listings were held back due to 
a strong day for sterling. The pound strengthened on renewed enthusiasm for the UK ensuring a transition deal with 
the EU that will give businesses continuity.
The FTSE 100 closed up 0.6 per cent. A strong currency typically cuts revenues for the international companies 
that dominate the FTSE 100 and do much of their business outside the UK.
The FTSE 250, made up of smaller constituents and more focused on the UK economy, was up 1.1 per cent. 
Financials added the most points to the index - HSBC rose 0.6 per cent, Prudential 2.2 per cent and Barclays 1.1 
per cent.
However, shares in London-listed spreadbetters IG Group, Plus500 and CMC Markets plunged between 9.2 per 
cent and 12.5 per cent after the European Union's securities watchdog said it may curb core parts of their market 
under sweeping new product powers from January.
Unilever was up 0.3 per cent after initial losses after it agreed to sell its margarine and spreads business to US 
private equity firm KKR for (EURO)6.83bn (£6bn) to concentrate on faster growing products.
LSE gained 0.3 per cent with reports that activist hedge fund The Children's Investment Fund, which has a five per 
cent stake in the London Stock Exchange Group, is unlikely to succeed in its attempt to remove chairman Donald 
Brydon at a shareholder vote today.
Lonmin was down about three per cent as the CEO of the miner told Reuters that plans to cut around 13,000 jobs 
were likely to be the biggest obstacle for its suitor, Sibanye-Stillwater, to winning South African regulatory approval 
for its proposed takeover.

Michael O'Leary has switched doors to manual. For years the fleet-of-mouth Ryanair boss automatically rejected 
pilots' calls for unionisation. His shift to ingratiation this week - "Christmas flights are very important to our 
customers and we wish to remove worry or concern that they may be disrupted" - surprised the market, erasing 
(EURO)1.5bn of the carrier's equity value. But the door pulsing red on Ryanair's advent calendar was the 20th, 
when pilots had threatened to strike unless the airline recognised their unions. And maintaining the festive grin on 
passengers' faces is worth more to the airline than (EURO)1.5bn.
Ryanair's mess-up over pilot rostering this autumn taught Mr O'Leary the price of a PR disaster, if he didn't know it 
before. The bill for cancelling 700,000 bookings, reimbursing passengers and improving pilots' packages to draw 
them back to the cockpit will be (EURO)125m-plus. That did not shift forecasts of (EURO)1.45bn in pre-tax profits 
this year. Even so, Ryanair's market value fell by more than (EURO)1bn in the autumn as well.
Stephen Furlong at stockbroker Davy points out the carrier's ex-fuel costs per passenger of (EURO)27 - of which 
staff represent just (EURO)5 - are still half that of its nearest rival. Even if the outlay on employees rises to 
(EURO)6, Ryanair's costs will be a lot lighter than competitors.
The bigger factors for Ryanair remain fuel costs and appetite for air travel. The group has plenty of legroom, even if 
its customers don't.
Keeping festive grins on faces is worth more to Ryanair than (EURO)1.5bn UK COMPANIES
Still, if Ryanair - already the biggest no-frills airline on the EU bloc - is to have 600 planes in the air carrying 200m 
travellers by 2024, it needs the structures to fit and support from staff as well as customers. That may make 
investors, enjoying 30 per cent returns on invested capital last year, question the trajectory of future returns. But if 
unionisation is the price of a smooth take-off and landing, it is a toll that is worth paying.

Unions representing Ryanair pilots in Ireland and Portugal on Sunday suspended plans to strike before Christmas, 
lifting the threat of industrial action at the low-cost giant after it agreed on Friday to recognize trade unions for the 
first time.
Ireland's Impact trade union and Portugal's SPAC announced the cancellation of 24-hour strikes due to take place 
on Wednesday after Ryanair agreed to recognize the unions as the representatives of pilots in the two countries.
Italy's ANPAC on Friday also suspended plans to strike.
While the decision to recognize trade unions for the first time in Ryanair's 32-year history has averted the threat of 
strikes, the move rattled investors and its shares fell almost 9 percent on Friday.
Impact said it would meet Ryanair management on Tuesday and "looked forward to establishing a positive 
relationship."
Ryanair earlier said British union BALPA and Italian union ANPAC had agreed to meet with Ryanair in early 
January. It said it had offered to meet SPAC on Thursday.
"Let's keep talking. Get people home quietly for Christmas," Ryanair Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew said in a 
statement on Saturday.
In addition to union recognition, pilot unions have been seeking an overhaul of the airline's system of contracts and 
collective bargaining. (Reuters)

Airlines largely kept a grip on their improved profitability off the back of continued strong air travel demand in 2017, 
but the positive mood was punctuated by a series of high-profile challenges and service interruptions that 
dominated headlines.
In North America, the practice of overbooking came publicly into view when a video of the forced removal of a 
passenger from a United Airlines flight went viral. While United found itself in the eye of a storm of negative 
coverage regarding the incident – and its initial response – the focus shifted to the wider overbooking practices 
across US carriers.
The incident led to a review of the practice – and while United, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines all amended 
their policies as a result, grillings followed by US lawmakers, and new consumer rules were included in the bill to 
reauthorise the US Federal Aviation Administration budget.
United was also at the forefront of the other major battleground in the US market this year: the fight for price-
conscious travellers. The Star Alliance carrier rapidly rolled out its no-frills basic economy fare, but was forced to 
take a step back from it amid a fierce competitive response from rivals.
By September the largest US carriers were lowering their third-quarter unit revenue expectations as, nearly 
universally, they reported a spike in competitive pricing activity. While US carriers continue to lead industry 
profitability, the competitive pricing – combined with the negative impact from the damaging hurricane season – has 
taken the gloss off their profit performance.
ANALYSIS: Disruptions interrupt profitable 2017 for airlines Airlines largely kept a grip on their improved 
profitability off the back of continued strong air t....
As US airlines were grappling – in some cases literally – with their overbooked passengers, in Europe the 
difference between an "IT meltdown" and a "power failure" had to be explained by British Airways. The incident 
grounded a host of BA flights and served as an illustration of the almost impossible customer service challenges 
that disruption can cause.
That was to become further apparent when Ryanair, having positioned itself as an airline that now cares about its 
customer service, found itself with plenty of customer care to do following its pilot-rostering process went wrong. 
After initially hoping to control the crisis with a series of flight cancellations in September and October, it ultimately 
had to make a second wave of cancellations and temper growth plans in a bid to wrest back control of the situation.
Yet the underlying strong business environment – and IAG and Ryanair have been among the most robust groups 
in Europe in recent years – means both are still on course to make record-high profits for the 2017 financial year. 
Indeed, European airlines as a whole are likely to improve profits.
That comes even with the woes of Monarch Airlines, Air Berlin and Alitalia. None were strangers to the last-chance 
saloon. But Monarch ceased flights at the start of October, and flights under the Air Berlin brand followed suit by the 
end of that month. It remains to be seen how Alitalia's fresh spell in administration will play out.
Much of the pressure for all three came from the competitive impact from increased capacity. That was 
compounded by the shift of capacity from still-recovering tourism markets in North Africa and Turkey into popular 
Mediterranean markets.
But there does not seem much likelihood that cuts to these carriers will have a significant impact in reducing 
capacity. EasyJet and Lufthansa have moved in to take the prime assets from Air Berlin – and are also among 
those vying for the same at Alitalia – while carriers have already begun filling the void left by Monarch.
LONG-HAUL DEVELOPMENT
Europe to the Americas was also at the heart of the burgeoning long-haul low-cost model – both for operators like 
Norwegian and in the competitive response from network carriers on either side of the Atlantic. That has, for 
example, involved IAG launching its own Barcelona-based operation Level. The popularity of the model – and 
contrasting fortunes of the all-premium model – was further evident when IAG announced plans to replace its 
premium OpenSkies operation out of Paris Orly with Level.
The long-haul low-cost model has been aided by the still relatively low fuel costs and the arrival of next-generation 
aircraft. Norwegian is, for example, using its first Boeing 737 Max 8s to launch routes from Europe to new points on 
the US east coast: Hartford, Newburgh Stewart and Providence.
But new aircraft and relatively benign fuel costs were supported by wider new route development as a whole.
Norwegian had also benefited from the granting of its controversial authority to operate long-haul flights under its 
UK subsidiary. Campaigners against the move urged the incoming Trump administration to consider reversing the 
decision. While there was no movement, it did not take long for the new US president's policies to have an impact 
on overseas operators.
In particular, several Middle East and North African operators were hit first by the attempted travel ban on citizens 
from seven Muslim-majority countries visiting the USA, and then the implementation of restrictions on bringing large 
personal electronic devices on board flights to the USA from a number of airports in the same region. UK authorities 
followed suit, albeit with a different list of airports.
Notably, the UK list of restricted airports excluded major hubs like Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha, which were all 
included in the US restrictions. That left the US open to accusations that its actions were related to the ongoing 
campaign by the big US carriers and unions that are pressing for a review of open-skies deals with Qatar and the 
UAE over alleged subsidies received by its main carriers – allegations rejected by the Gulf giants.
ANALYSIS: Disruptions interrupt profitable 2017 for airlines Airlines largely kept a grip on their improved 
profitability off the back of continued strong air t....
The UK and USA began lifting the restrictions in the summer, but the simmering row between the big Gulf and US 
carriers rumbles on. American Airlines hardly welcomed a planned – but ultimately aborted – move by Qatar 
Airways to take up to 10% of the carrier. The airline also then dropped its codeshare with Qatar and Etihad, 
prompting the latter to drop its Dallas/Fort Worth service. These factors all contribute to a first year in recent 
memory featuring a fall in UAE carrier capacity to the USA.
Middle East carriers were also hit by diplomatic tensions closer to home when the severing of ties with Qatar by a 
number of states in the region resulted in the closing of airspace in several markets. Any hopes that the spat, which 
took place in June, would be temporary proved unfounded and routes between countries involved remain closed.
Qatar Airways later turned its investment attentions to Cathay Pacific, acquiring around 10% of its Oneworld partner 
in November. That followed similar investments in two other Oneworld partners: British Airways and Iberia parent 
IAG, and LATAM Airlines. Qatar also completed its acquisition of a 49% stake in Italian carrier Meridiana, just as its 
Gulf rival Etihad's own European airline investment strategy was cracking.
Cathay Pacific was dominating many of the headlines among Asia-Pacific carriers, as it and Singapore Airlines 
continued restructuring efforts. The latter, which continues to develop its group structure by developing low-cost and 
regional units Scoot and Silk Air respectively, has made some progress, though yields remain under pressure. 
Cathay, meanwhile, is embarking on a major restructuring under new chief executive Rupert Hogg. But its worst 
interim loss for more than two decades illustrates that it remains a work in progress.
African carriers largely struggled to break free of the shackles that have held back their progress. Notably, South 
African Airways spent much of the year as a political football. The airline will receive a further bailout as it aims to 
secure a strategic investor. It remains to be seen whether the departure of its controversial chair Dudi Myeni in 
October will signal a settling of some of the boardroom issues that have plagued its progress.
Elsewhere, there were signs of some recovery in key travel markets which have suffered the impact of geopolitical 
and security issues – such as Turkey. But wider security and terrorist issues continue to impact many markets.
Despite all the challenges from a travel demand perspective, however, the picture is strong. While capacity 
expansion continues to keep yields under pressure, airlines have been able to lift passenger numbers and load 
factors. And while the oil price has crept up over the year, fuel costs remain relatively low.
The demand environment has remained strong and, given various struggles in recent years, the key BRIC 
economies have been consistently positive, helping support growth in emerging markets. As a result, despite 
various negative headlines across the year, 2017 has proved another profitable one for airlines.

RYANAIR has proposed talks with an Irish pilot union before a possible Wednesday strike in a bid to remove the 
last threat to its Christmas schedule after its surprise offer to recognise unions for the first time.
Two other trade unions - Italy's ANPAC and Portugal's SPAC - withdrew plans for Christmas strikes after Friday's 
announcement.
However, Ireland's Impact trade union is looking for further reassurances before cancelling its walkout.
Impact said on Saturday a meeting on Wednesday would come too late to prevent the 24-hour strike planned for 
the same day.
On Saturday evening Ryanair offered to meet union representatives tomorrow instead.
"Ryanair has offered to meet Impact/IALPA and their Ryanair pilot committee [tomorrow] if that would suit them 
better," chief operations officer Peter Bellew said in a statement posted on his Instagram account.
A spokesman for Impact said it was ready to meet Ryanair at any time.
"Once we meet, we can take a decision on deferring industrial action," he said.
Bellew said the German union VC had agreed to meet Ryanair on Wednesday to discuss union recognition.

He said Ryanair had offered to meet Portuguese pilots' union SPAC on 21 December and that British pilots' union 
BALPA and its Italian union counterpart ANPAC had agreed to meet the Irish low-cost carrier early next month.
"Let's keep talking. Get people home quietly for Christmas," Bellew added.

AIRLINES are facing rising turbulence from sky-high customer expectations, amid a tough competitive environment, 
which has seen the likes of Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia run into trouble this year.
According to research out today from KPMG Nunwood, customer experience has dipped this year, as big names 
struggle to keep up with rising expectations from passengers.
The airline sector's customer experience dropped from 7.41 to 7.14, which KPMG said reflected the overall trend 
cross-sector that saw its score falling from 7.33 to 7.08.
KPMG's customer experience excellence score is a weighted average of each brand's score, mapped against a 
series of characteristics that KPMG said drives brand loyalty, including integrity, expectations and empathy.
John Luke, UK head of aviation at KPMG, said: "The 'traditional' lowcost airlines are now having to address 
customer experience, as a growing number of overseas companies are replicating the low-cost business model, 
shifting the focus to customer experience as the differentiator."
KPMG's annual analysis of more than 10,000 consumers found that Emirates led the way on customer experience 
in the UK airline sector.
It comes as a new survey by Which? found a vast range in the performance of airlines that fly from the UK, with the 
likes of British Airways, Ryanair and Vueling swooping below passenger expectations. The latter two came in joint 
last place, with a customer score of 45 per cent, while BA was third from the bottom.

Ryanair executive: Recognition of pilots' union 'great step change'
Ryanair executive: Recognition of pilots' union 'great step change'

Ryanair has taken a "great step change" with its decision to recognize pilots' unions, but is not prepared to go 
further and also recognize flight assistants' unions, a top executive said in a Saturday interview.
"We are not bluffing. [Yesterday] our shares lost 7 per cent on the stock market and therefore we are very serious: 
for us this is a great step change compared to the past and we will not go back," Chief Operating Officer Peter 
Bellew told Italy's La Repubblica daily.
Ryanair's move was announced on Friday, after pilots' unions in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal 
threatened unprecedented industrial action in the run-up to the Christmas holidays against unsatisfactory working 
conditions.
Bellew, whose predecessor resigned in October amid flight cancellations chaos forced by pilot shortages, said the 
budget airline opted for "dialogue" because it did not "want to put at risk [its] customers' Christmas."
He said that talks with pilots' unions would start next week, or in January at the latest, in all of Ryanair's European 
hubs, but he also said the company was not prepared to extend talks to flight assistants, who also demand union 
recognition.
"We are only talking to pilots," Bellew said.
According to the German pilots' union, Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no 
obligatory work schedule, no retirement planning and a widely prevalent system of pseudo-self-employed pilots.
In the La Repubblica interview, Bellew insisted that self-employed pilots only make up 24 per cent of Ryanair's total.

       ROME (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair has taken a 'great step change' with its decision to recognize pilots' unions, but is 
not prepared to go further and also recognize flight assistants' unions, a top executive said in a Saturday interview.  
'We are not bluffing. 
[Yesterday] our shares lost 7 per cent on the stock market and therefore we are very serious: for us this is a great 
step change compared to the past and we will not go back,' Chief Operating Officer Peter Bellew told Italy's La 
Repubblica daily.   Ryanair's move was announced on Friday, after pilots' unions in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Britain, 
Spain and Portugal threatened unprecedented industrial action in the run-up to the Christmas holidays against 
unsatisfactory working conditions.   Bellew, whose predecessor resigned in October amid flight cancellations chaos 
forced by pilot shortages, said the budget airline opted for 'dialogue' because it did not 'want to put at risk [its] 
customers' Christmas.'   He said that talks with pilots' unions would start next week, or in January at the latest, in all 
of Ryanair's European hubs, but he also said the company was not prepared to extend talks to flight assistants, 
who also demand union recognition.   'We are only talking to pilots,' Bellew said.   According to the German pilots' 
union, Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no obligatory work schedule, no 
retirement planning and a widely prevalent system of pseudo-self-employed pilots.  In the La Repubblica interview, 
Bellew insisted that self-employed pilots only make up 24 per cent of Ryanair's total.   Copyright dpa

Highlight: Michael O’Leary may have caved in to demands to negotiate with unions,  but there are several reasons 
why I won’t be selling my Ryanair shares 
Body
The decision by Ryanair on Friday to recognise pilot unions across several European countries was groundbreaking 
– a vital response to pilots’ grievances and a necessary move to avert strike action over the most critical days for 
passengers in the run-up to Christmas.
The concession is a climbdown, giving bargaining power to pilots across the company’s pan-European network. But 
it should avert the risk of a single and rather militant union in Dublin having control over the whole network.
The threat of industrial action from the Dublin-based pilots had exerted considerable downward pressure on the 
share price over the past fortnight. However, long-term shareholders who have remained invested in the company 
have seen a 350 per cent increase in the value of their investment over the past decade. Valued at €3.53 back in 
December 2007, Ryanair shares stood at €16.40 last week.
While the fall in 2017 will concern some shareholders, others will see it as a buying opportunity. Ryanair remains 
without peer in its sector. Its industrial relations problems, while troublesome, are relatively localised, sporadic and 
up to now have been manageable.
In terms of financial flexibility, Ryanair has scope to avert serious industrial relations disruption without denting its 
industry-leading operating margin or its traffic volumes – at least for anything but a very brief period.
With no balance sheet gearing, the company has deep pockets to continue its onward march and expansion, and to 
contain the impact of industrial relations demands.
Moreover, with a plentiful supply of pilots available at bases in other parts of Europe, it has the flexibility to switch 
operating bases and scale down its routes from Dublin from where the industrial relations problems have been 
initiated and led.
Michael Murray on Ryanair
So the balance of power hasn’t all rested with the pilots. The fact that Ryanair has now agreed to recognise pilot 
unions across several of its most important bases across Europe dilutes the power of the Dublin-based pilots.
In terms of supply and demand for pilots, Ryanair management have had the upper hand, as many competitors in 
mainland Europe on overlapping routes have gone bust. Three airlines, which account for 60 million customers – 
Air Berlin, Alitalia and Norwegian Air – have all gone under recently, diminishing competition and strengthening 
Ryanair’s position in the mainland European markets those companies served.
Pilots of the fallen airlines are now knocking on Ryanair’s door seeking employment. This has weakened the 
bargaining power of the unions in Dublin on recognition, and certainly on improved pay and conditions, given that 
their salaries are now already competitive with much of the rest of the industry.
Ryanair claims that the current disruption is being orchestrated by pilots who are shortly leaving the airline. Some 
claim this is “spinning” a story in a real industrial relations war. But the latest announcement confirms that the 
company is determined to avoid centralisation of pilot labour power in Dublin where only a small minority of its pilots 
are based.
The strength of the Ryanair brand is without peer in the low-cost travel segment of the market. While the airline now 
faces costs in satisfying its pilot staff across Europe, its operating margins are the best of its peer group by far and 
leave it with scope for flexibility that other airlines don’t have.
Its 22 per cent operating margin is nearly three times that of Easyjet, the other significant low-cost airline in Europe.
The company’s strengths – on whatever financial or asset management metric you choose to measure them by – 
are obvious. Its stock market value, at €20 billion, has left all of its rivals in the shade: the nearest runner-up in the 
low-cost space has been Easyjet, less than a third of its size with a €6.3 billion market cap. The International 
Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) – owners of Iberia Airways, Aer Lingus, British Midland International and the 
Spanish low-fare airline Vueling – has a stock market value less than two thirds that of Ryanair.
While investors may fear that the rise of militancy among Ryanair pilots sets the scene for more disruption to flights 
and a loss of customer confidence in the airline’s reliability, last Friday’s statement looks likely to quell pan-
European dissent – at least for the present.
The company claims it has no difficulty in recruiting pilots and that their pay and conditions would be well ahead of 
what they were used to with their now bankrupt former employers. Pilots’ pay at Ryanair, for example, is €23,000 
higher than at Norwegian Air, according to the airline.
With their employer demonstrating through its audited accounts that it has the highest operating margins in the 
business in Europe and the lowest costs, pilots may see room for concessions even if the discontent among them 
appears to be far from unanimous. However, organising a sustainable industrial dispute among pilots located 
across 30 countries would be a highly challenging feat given the nature and financial position of the rest of the 
industry, and the limits to Ryanair pilots’ unionisation even after last week’s announcement, which, while 
recognising trade unions, disperses their power.
Moreover, contract pilots and the surplus of pilots on the market gives Ryanair more flexibility than its Dublin-based 
pilots would like. The company remains in a “sweet spot” in its industry, maintaining costs up to 50 per cent lower 
than many of the legacy airlines and with the deep pockets needed to capitalise on competitors’ distress and 
bankruptcy.
For shareholders the business model remains robust. The company’s most recent initiatives of deepening the 
market segmentation of customers with multiple choices in relation to fast track onto the aircraft and seat choice – 
both of which command incremental fees (but not incremental costs ) – could help it sustain further its already 
record-breaking operating margins and go a distance to offsetting potentially higher operating costs in terms of the 
higher wage bill conceded to pilots.
Michael Murray on Ryanair
However, while it has an advantageous hedging programme on its energy costs, that advantage may be dissipated 
as the hedges roll off. In this regard, investors can be comforted by the fact that the company has had a good track 
record over the years in choosing the right hedging strategy for oil and has proved smarter than many competitors 
on this.
In the end, though, despite its considerable success, sometimes a company has to look itself in the mirror and 
decide whether a comprehensive makeover is necessary.
Michael O’Leary has been in situ as chief executive for 23 years now. Nobody can dispute the outstanding success 
of his strategy, but there comes a time when a transition makes sense if only to wipe the slate clean of the kind of 
insults and aggression that sometimes come with the job of being tough.
The low-cost strategy culture has been a boon for shareholders and passengers alike. While keeping staff 
motivated is important, conceding to endless industrial relations demands is almost certainly not the right course.
Local negotiations between the company and its pilots in the bases from which they operate is a perfectly 
reasonable stance for Ryanair to take. However, shareholders might be better served by a dilution in the value of 
their holdings not by the current industrial relations demands, but by increasing loyalty and incentives.
The way to do that is through an attractive and meaningful share option scheme: these schemes, when properly 
structured, not only motivate staff to remain with the airline, but to do their best for the shareholders and the 
travellers they serve.
Deferred rewards via the granting of share options are what probably make most sense from the perspective of 
tying people in and ensuring that staff, customer and shareholder interests are properly aligned. Dilution of existing 
shareholders’ interest by a couple of percentage points could well deliver better end results all around.
Without Michael O’Leary, and Tony Ryan before him, the company wouldn’t be in the pre-eminent position in 
European aviation it holds today. But sometimes an entrepreneur who is mightily successful at building and 
expanding is less adept at managing success and maturity in a business and in a business model. O’Leary has 
softened his communication and management approach slightly in recent times. But does he have the capacity to 
earn the loyalty of his pilots and other staff?
In any case, as a shareholder in Ryanair, I am confident the company can overcome the turbulence that low morale 
and sometimes unreasonable trade union behaviour can stimulate.

Ryanair has reversed decades of policy to recognise pilot unions for the first time, in a significant concession aimed 
at averting strikes next week by cockpit crew at the start of the busy Christmas season.
Europe's biggest airline by passenger number said it had written to pilot unions in several countries including 
Ireland, Britain, Germany and Italy, inviting them to start talks with a view to recognising the groups as official 
representatives.
"Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may 
be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive.
The move marks a capitulation by Mr O'Leary to unions he had vowed never to recognise in his 23 years at the 
helm of the Irish budget carrier. He has long castigated union efforts to establish a foothold in Ryanair and 
subjected them to withering criticism.
"If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union process, then we are prepared to 
do so, and we have written today to these unions inviting them to talks to recognise them and calling on them to 
cancel the threatened industrial action planned for Christmas week," Mr O'Leary said in a statement.
The letters also went to unions in Spain and Portugal.
Ryanair bows to pressure over unions Airlines
The shift by Ryanair follows a damaging scheduling crisis, which was triggered by a shortage of cockpit crew and a 
mess-up with pilot rotas.
The debacle led to the cancellation of 20,000 flights and prompted a pilot backlash for higher pay and better 
employment terms. Ryanair offered to increase pay and improve job security in a move that would cost 
(EURO)100m a year, but it was met with a chilly response from some pilots.
The airline had been facing fresh disruption as Dublin pilots served notice to strike on Wednesday. Italian pilots had 
threatened a stoppage yesterday afternoon - which was cancelled - and German pilots were also considering 
action. Italian government officials had been highly critical of Ryanair this week after it sought to dissuade 
employees from participating in a strike, but did not immediately comment on the airline's move yesterday.
"Ryanair initially thought it could function by ignoring the rights of its employees but now, faced with reality, it is 
opening its eyes," said Antonio Piras, general secretary of FIT-CISL, which represents airline industry workers.
Impact, the Irish union that represents Dublin pilots, said yesterday it was considering correspondence from Ryanair 
and would respond in due course.
Mr O'Leary was not available to comment. In his statement he said recognising unions would present "significant 
change" in Ryanair's business. But he added that the carrier had delivered radical change before, citing the launch 
of its 2013 "always getting better" initiative to improve customer service. Ryanair hopes to agree new structures 
with pilots early in the new year. Additional reporting by James Politi in Rome

Dublin and in Stansted," he said.

The businessman and lawyer James Osborne, who died suddenly earlier this year, left €15.3 million in his will.
Records filed at the Probate Office in Dublin show that the longstanding director of Ryanair, the chairman of the 
bookseller Eason and former managing partner at A&L Goodbody solicitors left €15,286,826. He died aged 68.
Osborne first made his name at A&L Goodbody after qualifying from Trinity College Dublin in 1973.
He became a managing partner in 1982 when he was just 32.
He also served as chairman of Independent News and Media (INM) between 2011 and 2012 when a battle between 
shareholders Denis O’Brien and Tony O’Reilly became increasingly fraught.
Osborne famously closed the meeting where he was voted off the board of INM by saying: “And that concludes the 
annual general meeting of the not-so-Independent News and Media.”
His career saw him sit on the boards of Carrolls Holdings, Golden Vale and Adare. Osborne is survived by his 
partner Patricia Devine and their young daughter, as well as two adult children from an earlier marriage.

LONDON (AP) - Budget carrier Ryanair said Friday it is reversing its longstanding refusal to recognize pilots' unions 
in a bid to avert strikes in several European countries over the busy Christmas season.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the airline wants to ease customers' concerns "that they may be disrupted by 
pilot industrial action next week."
"If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognized union process, then we are prepared to 
do so," he said.
Earlier this week, pilots in Ireland voted for a day of industrial action Dec. 20 and a union representing pilots in 
Germany threatened walkouts at "any time starting immediately" in disputes over pay and conditions. Italian and 
Portuguese pilot unions also threatened strikes in the coming days.
Ryanair said its offer applied to pilots' bodies in those countries, as well as Britain and Spain. The airliner, which 
insisted earlier this week it would not deal with the unions, said its new offer was conditional on unions in the six 
countries setting up special committees to deal with issues related to the airline.
Ryanair pilots in Italy suspended a strike planned for Friday afternoon after the company's announcement.
The airline had come under intense criticism in Italy for a letter to employees threatening action against anyone who 
strikes.
The Fit-Cisl union threatened legal action in response, saying Ryanair's letter violated the Italian constitution, while 
the government asked the company for clarification of its intentions.
Economic Development Minister Carlo Calenda said on private TV La7 that Ryanair's move to recognize unions 
was not a concession: "It's the minimum, and not enough."
A spokesman for the Irish pilots' union, IMPACT, said it had received Ryanair's letter and was considering its 
contents.
In about-face, Ryanair recognizes unions to avert strikes
Germany's Cockpit union welcomed Ryanair's move but said it is up to the airline "to underscore the seriousness of 
its proposal" and called on the company to agree to talks as early as next week.
Cockpit's chairman, Ilja Schulz, said that "as soon as we have received dates to start the negotiation process, 
planned strike measures will be called off."

 Irish aircraft operator Ryanair (RYAAY.L) has agreed to recognize pilot unions in numerous countries in a bid to 
avoid widespread disruption from the possibility of strikes over the busy festive season.
The low-cost airline said on Friday that it had written to the pilot unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain 
and Portugal inviting each of them to talks to recognize these unions as the representative body for pilots in Ryanair 
in each of these countries.
The company said that it would now change its long standing policy of not recognizing unions in order to avoid any 
threat of disruption to its customers and flights from pilot unions during Christmas week. It also said that it is calling 
on these pilot unions to "call off the threatened industrial action on Wednesday 20 December".
"Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may 
be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week," Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said. "If the best way to achieve this is 
to talk to our pilots through a recognized union process, then we are prepared to do so, and we have written today 
to these unions inviting them to talks to recognize them and calling on them to cancel the threatened industrial 
action planned for Christmas week.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Europe's no-frills airline Ryanair recognized pilot union for a smooth holiday season 
ahead.   The airline had a discussion with its pilots union in Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal to iron 
out the issues. 
The pilots working for Ryanair have been enjoying different status and many of them were reportedly not in the rolls 
as full timers.   The Dublin-based airline's pilots were planning for a strike next week from December 20. The new 
agreement will change the pilots' plan and hopefully there would not be any disruptions for passengers flying during 
Christmas and New Year.   A website post from Ryanair said it will now change its long standing policy of not 
recognizing unions in order to avoid any threat of disruption to its customers and its flights from pilot unions during 
Christmas week.   'Ryanair now calls on these pilot unions to call off the threatened industrial action on Wed 20 Dec 
next so that our customers can look forward to travelling home for Christmas without the threat or worry of pilot 
strikes hanging over them.'  Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said, 'Christmas flights are very important to 
our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may be disrupted by pilot industrial action 
next week.  Earlier in September, when the pilots went on vacation en masse, the airline had to cancel more than 
2100 schedules in Europe. The airline had lost $30 million and the cancellations affected more than 315,000 
passengers. The management had apologized to the passengers and investors for the mess-up.

       By Lennart Simonsson and Alvise Armellini, dpa   LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Budget airline Ryanair announced 'a 
significant change' on Friday, saying it has agreed to recognize pilot unions as part of efforts to avoid planned strike 
action during the Christmas holiday season.  Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he had written to the 
unions 'inviting them to talks to recognize them and calling on them to cancel the threatened industrial action 
planned for Christmas week.'  While unions reacted cautiously to the offer, Italy's largest airline pilots union, 
ANPAC, called off a strike scheduled for Friday after Ryanair agreed to recognize their organization.  'It is a very 
important first step,' ANPAC said. 
However, it urged Ryanair to additionally recognize unions for flight assistants, also represented by ANPAC.  
Another Italian flight assistants union, Fit-Cisl, went ahead with a separate four-hour strike because it had not 
received an offer of recognition from Ryanair.  Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda, who earlier this week 
criticized Ryanair for its 'indecent' stance against unions and the right to strike, commented on Friday's decision to 
recognize unions.  'It is not a concession ... it is the bare minumum and it is not enough,' he told the La7 TV 
channel.  'If Ryanair wants to remain in Italy it must do it respecting the rules and the [workers'] rights that apply in 
Italy,' Calenda added.  The recognition of pilots unions was a reversal of Ryanair's long-standing stance.  O'Leary 
said that if strikes could be avoided by talking to the 'pilots through a recognized union process, then we are 
prepared to do so.'  The Irish airline is facing the prospect of Europe-wide pilot strikes for the first time in its history. 
Earlier this year, it was hit by the cancellation of thousands of flights due to staffing problems.  'We wish to remove 
any worry or concern that [customers] may be disrupted by pilot industrial action,' O'Leary's statement read.  The 
airline said it has contacted pilot unions in Ireland, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Walkouts and strike 
action were mooted earlier this week by unions in these countries.  The German pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit 
(VC), said it would accept Ryanair's offer and was willing to negotiate working conditions.  However, it demanded 
that the airline move beyond symbolic steps and warned that if this move turns out to be a mere 'stalling tactic, we 
will respond in the strongest terms.'  On Tuesday, VC had said walkouts would take place in the airline's 10 German 
hubs, without naming exact dates. It pledged to give passengers advance warning and not strike during the prime 
Christmas holiday period of December 23-26.  The Impact trade union in Ireland, with which the Irish Airline Pilots' 
Association (IALPA) is affiliated, said in a Facebook post that it wanted 'an immediate meeting' with Ryanair

the more than 10,000 commercial pilots flying in Britain, tweeted he had also received an offer of 'recognition talks 
from Ryanair.'  The unions in Italy, Portugal and Ireland accuse Ryanair, founded in 1985, of operating with 
unsatisfactory working conditions under Irish law for around 4,000 pilots.  Ryanair offers no continued payment of 
wages in the event of sickness, no obligatory work schedule, no retirement planning and a widely prevalent system 
of pseudo self-employed pilots, VC's president Ilja Schulz said this week.   Copyright dpa

Ryanair announced on Friday that it would recognize pilot unions for the first time in its 32-year history in a bid to 
stop its first pilot strike from taking place later in the day.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary's refusal to recognize unions was at the heart of the ultra low-cost model he 
developed to turn a small Irish regional airline into Europe's largest carrier by passenger numbers.
"Recognizing unions will be a significant change for Ryanair, but we have delivered radical change before," O'Leary 
said in a statement. "We hope and expect that these structures can and will be agreed with our pilots early in the 
New Year."
The move comes after pilots in several countries threatened strike action in the busy run-up to Christmas.
The Irish carrier said it would hold talks with unions in Ireland, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal to 
recognize them as long as they established a committee made up solely of Ryanair pilots, "as Ryanair will not 
engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or elsewhere."
Pilots and ground crew in Italy were due to take action first with a four-hour strike later on Friday, to be followed by 
a 24-hour stoppage by pilots in Ireland and Portugal on Dec. 20.
The pilots have mobilized in the wake of the announcement of 20,000 flight cancellations by the Irish carrier, which 
it blamed on a lack of standby pilots due to a failure in its rostering following a rule change by Irish regulators.
Ryanair had brought back Peter Bellew, previously the CEO of Malaysia Airlines and Ryanair's former director of 
flight operations, to help deal with the staffing issue.

The airline's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said there was no reason to think costs would increase as a result.

Budget airline Ryanair said Friday it has agreed to recognize pilot unions in "a significant change" that is part of 
efforts to avoid planned strike action during the Christmas holiday season.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said he had written to the unions "inviting them to talks to recognize them and calling 
on them to cancel the threatened industrial action planned for Christmas week."
The recognition of pilots unions was a reversal of the company's previous stance.
O'Leary said that if strikes could be avoided by talking to the "pilots through a recognized union process, then we 
are prepared to do so."
The Irish airline is facing the prospect of Europe-wide pilot strikes for the first time in its history. Earlier this year, it 
was hit by the cancellation of thousands of flights due to staffing problems.
"We wish to remove any worry or concern that [customers] may be disrupted by pilot industrial action," O'Leary's 
statement read.
The airline said it has contacted pilot unions in Ireland, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.
Walkouts and strike action were mooted earlier this week by pilot unions in these countries.
The German pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit (VC), said in an initial reaction Friday it would consider the 
negotiation offer.
More details were expected later Friday, the pilots' union said in an emailed statement to dpa.
Ryanair to recognize pilots unions in bid to avoid strikes
On Tuesday, the German pilots' union said walkouts would take place in the airline's 10 German hubs, without 
naming exact dates. It pledged to give passengers advance warning and not strike during the prime Christmas 
holiday period of December 23-26.
A spokesman for the Impact trade union in Ireland, with which the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) is 
affiliated, said it would give the offer "full consideration," when it received the letter, the Press Association news 
agency reported.
IALPA earlier this week announced plans for a 24-hour strike involving dozens of Ryanair pilots on December 20.
Labour action was also due in Portugal and Italy.
The unions in Italy, Portugal and Ireland accuse Ryanair, founded in 1985, of operating with unsatisfactory working 
conditions under Irish law for around 4,000 pilots.
Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no obligatory work schedule, no retirement 
planning and a widely prevalent system of pseudo self-employed pilots, VC's Schulz said this week.

Budget airline Ryanair announced "a significant change" on Friday, saying it has agreed to recognize pilot unions 
as part of efforts to avoid planned strike action during the Christmas holiday season.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said he had written to the unions "inviting them to talks to recognize them and calling 
on them to cancel the threatened industrial action planned for Christmas week."
Pilot unions reacted cautiously to the offer, but Italy's biggest airline pilots union, ANPAC, called off a strike 
scheduled for Friday after Ryanair agreed to recognize their organization.
"It is a very important first step," ANPAC said in a statement, welcoming the budget airline's decision. However, it 
urged Ryanair to also recognize unions for flight assistants, also represented by ANPAC.
Meanwhile, another Italian flight assistants union, Fit-Cisl, went ahead with a separate four-hour strike because it 
had received no offer of recognition from Ryanair.
Italian industry minister Carlo Calenda, who earlier this week criticized Ryanair for its "indecent" stance against 
unions and the right to strike, commented on Friday's decision to recognize unions: "It is not a concession [...] it is 
the bare minumum and it is not enough," he told the La7 TV channel.
"If Ryanair wants to remain in Italy it must do it respecting the rules and the [workers'] rights that apply in Italy," 
Calenda added.
The recognition of pilots unions was a reversal of Ryanair's long-standing stance.

Labour action was also planned in Portugal, according to the pilot union SPAC.
Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA), which represents about 85 per 
cent of the over 10,000 commercial pilots flying in Britain, tweeted he had also received an offer of "recognition 
talks from Ryanair" and would respond later.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stocks were mostly lower in the mid-market trading 
Friday, weighed down by retailers H&M and Ferragamo with their weak trading updates. Investors are also 
concerned of uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. tax reform plan and as they assess messages from the Federal 
Reserve and European Central Bank meetings.  Senator Marco Rubio, R-Fla., indicated his opposition to the 
legislation currently being negotiated. 
 On a positive note, data showed an unexpected increase in US retail sales and a drop in jobless claims.  The pan-
European Stoxx Europe 600 index traded down 1.67 points or 0.43 percent to 387.24.  France's CAC 40 index 
traded down 22.48 points or 0.42 percent to 5,334.66.  The benchmark DAX in Germany moved down 38.67 points 
or 0.30 percent to 13,029.41.  Meanwhile, the FTSE 100, U.K.'s benchmark for blue-chip stocks, traded up 5.91 
points or 0.08 percent at 7,454.03, erasing early losses.  In corporate news, Hennes & Mauritz AB or H&M were 
plunging around 15 percent after the Swedish retailer reported weak sales in its fourth quarter. The second largest 
fashion retailer's results were hurt by fewer shoppers visiting its stores.  Italian luxury goods company Ferragamo 
fell around 7 percent after it said it could not confirm earlier set three-year targets and that 2018 would be another 
year of transition.  Ryanair Holdings plc were down 3 percent after it said the airline has invited pilot unions for talks 
to recognise them and that it will now change the long standing policy of not recognising unions in order to avoid 
any threat of disruption to its flights during Christmas week.   Further, CropEnergies's shares were down 6 percent 
after reporting weak operating profit in its third quarter.  However, cement giant LafargeHolcim's shares were 
gaining around 3 percent after it said its executive committee will be reduced to 9 members. The company said the 
30 largest country organizations will directly report to the Executive Committee and the global business functions 
will be merged under one leadership.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - The European markets were trapped in a sideways pattern 
throughout Friday's session and ended the day with mixed results. Retailers were under pressure after weak trading 
updates from both H&M and Ferragamo. Bank stocks were also down due to concerns over U.S. tax reform.   
Germany's central bank raised its growth projections but the pace of expansion is forecast to slow through 2020.  
The largest euro area economy is forecast to grow 2.6 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2018, Bundesbank said 
Friday. 
The projection for 2017 was revised up from 1.9 percent and that for 2018 from 1.7 percent.   Similarly, the outlook 
for 2019 was lifted to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent estimated in June. The growth is forecast to ease to 1.5 percent 
in 2020. Meanwhile, Spain's central bank downgraded its growth projections citing the uncertainty arising from the 
situation in Catalonia.  In a report released Friday, the Bank of Spain said it anticipated that after growth of 3.1 
percent this year, gross domestic product will increase by 2.4 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in both 2019 and 
2020.   While the outlook for 2017 was retained, the projection for 2018 was lowered from 2.5 percent and that for 
2019 from 2.2 percent.  The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.21 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 
index of eurozone bluechip stocks increased 0.12 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some 
major U.K. companies, lost 0.06 percent.  The DAX of Germany climbed 0.27 percent, but the CAC 40 of France fell 
0.15 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. gained 0.57 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.12 
percent.  In Frankfurt, CropEnergies tumbled 13.63 percent after reporting weak operating profit in its third quarter.  
In London, Ryanair Holdings dropped 8.60 percent after it said the airline has invited pilot unions for talks to 
recognize them and that it will now change the long standing policy of not recognizing unions in order to avoid any 
threat of disruption to its flights during Christmas week.  Cement giant LafargeHolcim gained 2.09 percent in Zurich 
after it said its executive committee will be reduced to 9 members. The company said the 30 largest country 
organizations will directly report to the Executive Committee and the global business functions will be merged under 
one leadership.  Hennes & Mauritz plunged 12.98 percent in Stockholm after the retailer reported weak sales in its 
fourth quarter. The second largest fashion retailer's results were hurt by fewer shoppers visiting its stores.  Luxury 
goods company Ferragamo sank 6.38 percent in Milan after it said it could not confirm earlier set three-year targets 
and that 2018 would be another year of transition.  The Eurozone trade surplus declined to a three-month low in 
European Markets Finished Mostly Lower As Retailers Struggle
October as exports dropped amid an increase in imports, figures from Eurostat showed Friday. The trade surplus 
fell to a seasonally adjusted EUR 19 billion in October from EUR 24.5 billion in September. This was the lowest 
since July. The surplus was forecast to decline to EUR 24.3 billion.  Growth in New York manufacturing activity 
slowed by more than anticipated in the month of December, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York on Friday.  The New York Fed said its general business conditions index dropped to 18.0 in 
December from 19.4 in November, although a positive reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing 
activity. The index had been expected to dip to 18.6.  After reporting a much bigger than expected increase in U.S. 
industrial production in the previous month, the Federal Reserve released a report on Friday showing that 
production rose by less than expected in the month of November.  The Fed said industrial production edged up by 
0.2 percent in November after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.2 percent in October. Economists had expected 
production to climb by 0.3 percent compared to the 0.9 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has opened the door to union recognition for the first time as part of efforts to head off 
planned industry action by pilots ahead of the Christmas holiday period.
Ryanair has steadfastly refused to recognise unions, instead negotiating directly with pilots. But in a sea change it 
has today signalled its willingness to discuss union recognition.
It has written to pilot unions in six countries – Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal – inviting them to 
talks to recognise these unions as the representative body for pilots in each. But it says this depends on their 
establishing committees of Ryanair pilots to deal with the airline’s issues, repeating its stance that it will not engage 
with pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or elsewhere.
The measure comes after some of its pilots heaped pressure on the airline, already facing a backlash over the 
wave of flight cancellations stemming from its flight-rostering issues, by calling industrial action in support of 
securing union recognition. Pilots in Dublin had called a walkout for 20 December.
“Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may 
be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week,” says Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary.
“If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union process, then we are prepared to 
do so, and we have written today to these unions inviting them to talks to recognise them and calling on them to 
cancel the threatened industrial action planned for Christmas week.”
He acknowledges recognising unions will be a “significant change” for Ryanair, but points to measures the airline 
has already implemented under its 'Always Getting Better' customer-improvement programme.

Ryanair came under fire for its handling of flight cancellations forced by its over-allotment of pilot holidays in 
September. While it initially focused on informing passengers immediately impacted by the flight cancellations, it 
was criticised for leaving others passengers unclear as to whether their flights would be hit.
In offering to hold recognition talks, the carrier appears keen to avoid a further dose of uncertainty resulting from a 
strike.
“Putting the needs of our customers first, and avoiding disruption to their Christmas flights, is the reason why we will 
now deal with our pilots through recognised national union structures,” says O’Leary. “We hope and expect that 
these structures can and will be agreed with our pilots early in the new year.”

Besides Ryanair, two other potential bidders have come forward: Condor, which belongs to the British travel group 
Thomas Cook; and former Formula One racer Niki Lauda, who originally founded Niki before selling it to Air Berlin.
Niki declared itself insolvent and stopped flying on Wednesday, after after German flag carrier Lufthansa 
abandoned its bid to acquire the subsidiary of the now insolvent Air Berlin.
Lufthansa lost interest because EU monopoly authorities opposed the deal on competition grounds.
In early December, the European Commission approved the takeover of certain Air Berlin assets by British low-cost 
carrier Easyjet.

Ryanair is making contingency plans for disruption to flights after pilot unions in three countries announced strikes 
for the coming days and two others threatened industrial action.
The strikes, which would be the first in Ryanair's 32-year history, are being organised by pilots demanding an 
overhaul of the company's system of contracts and collective bargaining, which they say gives management too 
much power.
Pilots and ground crew in Italy are due to take action first with a four-hour strike on Friday, to be followed by a 24-
hour stoppage by pilots in Ireland and Portugal on Dec. 20.
Pilots in Germany and Spain have said they are considering industrial action.
"Ryanair has been notified of threatened industrial action up to and including a 24-hour strike on Wednesday Dec. 
20 next by a minority of our pilots in Ireland, Portugal, Germany, Italy and Spain. This may lead to some flight 
disruptions," a spokesman for the airline said in a statement on Thursday.
The company will publish contingency plans to minimise disruptions on Dec. 18, he said.
"We apologise sincerely to our customers... Rest assured that we will do everything we can to minimise disruption 
for our customers," the spokesman said.
Pilots at Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers have mobilised in the wake of the announcement of 20,000 
flight cancellations by the Irish carrier, which it blamed on a lack of standby pilots due to a failure in its rostering 
following a rule change by Irish regulators.
Ryanair warns threatened industrial action may disrupt flights
Ryanair has denied claims by pilots that it has a pilot shortage.
Ryanair, which does not recognise trade unions, promised to "face down" the threatened strike.
Management has warned pilots in internal memos that pilots who take part in strike action may lose out on 
promotions and could cause the company to shift planes and jobs to lower-cost bases.
Portuguese union SPAC said in a statement that it "deeply regrets the failure by management to engage with the 
pilots' representatives in a meaningful manner."
It said its pilots had decided to strike because Ryanair was refusing to offer contracts under local rather than Irish 
law and to recognise the union's company council as its exclusive negotiating partner in Portugal.
Ryanair refuses to recognise unions, insisting instead on its own system of collective bargaining. Most pilots are 
hired on Irish contracts.
SPAC also demanded "a commitment to end the established culture of fear and bullying towards its (Ryanair's) 
crew." Ryanair denies there is any bullying at the airline and says it pilots have some of the best pay and conditions 
in the sector.
A spokesman for German union VC said it had not yet set a date for a strike in Germany. (Reuters)

Airlines’ headline figures for 2017 were impressive, reflecting another year of rising traffic and growing profits in 
most regions.
To use sporting parlance, many chief executives would have taken that before the game started.
With this in mind, the year-end is a good time to stop and consider exactly what went well for the industry in 2017.
On a fundamental level, aviation has successfully offered a high-profile antidote to those highlighting the downsides 
of globalisation, including US president Donald Trump and advocates of a "hard" Brexit. For all Trump’s bluster on 
building a wall between the USA and Mexico, for example, air connectivity between the two countries has risen. As 
VivaAerobus chief executive Juan Carlos ZuaZua told FlightGlobal in September: “Build a wall and we’ll fly over it.”
In this context, IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac was right to repeat his belief that aviation is the “business 
of freedom” several times during the year.
Meanwhile, a ban on large electronic items on flights to Europe and the USA from the Middle East and elsewhere 
was dealt with sensibly by IATA, ensuring the measures were short-lived and the damage minimal. For an industry 
used to seeing temporary security measures become quasi-permanent arrangements – the ongoing liquids ban 
being an obvious example – this was an impressive outcome.
MAINTAINING PROFITS
Carriers have also shown resilience following their own missteps.
High-profile examples in 2017 include British Airways’ IT shutdown in April, which it blamed on a power surge. 
While profits took a small hit, the UK carrier continued to be a driving force as parent IAG reported record results.
OPINION: The airline industry's success stories from 2017 E Airlines’ headline figures for 2017 are impressive,

European low-cost giant Ryanair, meanwhile, continues to expect a record financial year despite the hammering it 
received in the press following its pilot rostering woes and consequent flight cancellations.
It remains to be seen whether American Airlines chief executive Doug Parker was being overly optimistic when he 
said “I don’t think we’ve ever going to lose money again” at an investor day in late September, but his sentiment 
reflects an undeniable confidence among key airlines that they can ride the waves of internal and external 
challenges.
Another area of focus over the past 12 months has been cost-cutting. Large legacy groups across the world are 
feeling the pressure as low-cost carriers grow into new and existing markets, and airlines in developing markets 
challenge the old guard. On the latter point, witness Cathay Pacific’s need to respond to competition from state-
owned carriers in China.
While this cost environment has brought tough challenges, a sharp and constant focus on trimming the fat will 
ultimately make airlines stronger and better able to cope with future difficulties.
Meanwhile, the chaotic consolidation under way in Europe is ultimately a good thing for the industry overall. The 
pain being felt by employees of carriers such as Alitalia, Air Berlin and Monarch during 2017 is clearly unfortunate, 
but the region will ultimately benefit from having a smaller group of stronger carriers.
Also in Europe, the industry is getting a strong of taste of what disruptors can do to a market, as Norwegian’s 
growth is challenged by IAG's start-up Level and others. For an industry that is exposed to accusations of glacial 
modernisation, such developments should be welcomed. They ultimately give passengers more choice and ensure 
every airline is innovating in terms of product.
Throughout 2017, low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers also continued to shake up the short-haul flying products for 
the better. This impact was felt in multiple regions over the 12 months, with many network carriers waking from 
years of strategic slumber to find a much-needed focus on product strategy. In Asia, for example, Singapore 
Airlines consolidated its budget operations under the brand Scoot; in Europe, British Airways ended free food for 
economy passengers on short-haul routes, while staid Air France launched fashion-conscious operator Joon; and in 
the US, the big three legacy airlines continued to unbundle fares.
Even when that unbundling did not go to plan – United Airlines took a big financial hit, for example, when the rapid 
roll-out of fare changes backfired earlier this year – resilience allows the stronger players to bounce back.
CAPACITY QUESTIONS
Elsewhere, traffic trends have also been encouraging in 2017, providing at least short-term comfort to those 
expressing doubts about the huge capacity coming into the market in coming years. FlightGlobal data shows that 
traffic growth measured in RPKs is outpacing the rise in capacity in all global regions during 2017.
The robustness of load factors has also been crucial in offsetting a challenging fare environment, particularly as fuel 
costs returned to an upward trend over the course of the year.
For Middle East carriers, those rising fuel costs reflect rising oil prices – a positive development for a region where 
oil money drives so much economic activity. That will be welcomed by carriers such as Emirates, Etihad Airways 
and Qatar Airways as they face a “new normal” of slower progress after years of accelerated growth. It will be 
particularly helpful to the latter, as it continues to plot its strategy amid Qatar's diplomatic and airspace isolation in 
the region.
In macro-economic terms, 2017 also proved positive. Consumer confidence has been largely strong across the 
board, and developments such as the tentative economic comeback in Brazil – a market crucial to the health of the 
Latin American region as a whole – have been welcomed.
OPINION: The airline industry's success stories from 2017 E Airlines’ headline figures for 2017 are impressive, 
reflecting another year of rising traffic and im....
Another positive outcome, partly as a consequence of that economic robustness, has been the comeback in cargo 
markets. That has helped drive revenue increases, particularly in Asia-Pacific, where freight tends to take a bigger 
portion of revenue.
Security is another area where despite inherent volatility depending on region, there have been some positive 
developments compared with 2016.
Turkey could be back on the road to challenging the dominance of Gulf hubs following a tough 2016. Local carriers 
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus Airlines have returned to growth as Istanbul continues work on its crucial third airport.
In Northern Africa meanwhile, resorts in Egypt and Tunisia that have been affected by security concerns in recent 
years are beginning to look like viable tourist destinations again to a wider group of travellers.
UNDERSTANDING BENEFITS
Indeed, in Africa and other developing regions, the industry can still cite huge growth potential if – clearly a big “if” in 
some cases – certain challenges can be overcome around infrastructure and government understanding of 
aviation’s benefits. The past 12 months brought some positive moves in those areas, for example in Argentina, 
where the government ramped up its aviation liberalisation efforts and invested in airport improvements.
Perhaps most importantly of all, 2017 has been another strong year for airline safety. For an industry handling more 
than 100,000 flights per day, the incredibly low incident rate is no mean achievement. This is vitally important as 
capacity grows, considering safety perception surveys show most people judge industry performance on the overall 
number of incidents, rather than incidents as a proportion of total flights.
The resilience of the sector over the past 12 months is perhaps most significant because it is likely to face the same 
pressures – and who knows what else – again in 2018.
So while no one is suggesting carriers go into 2018 with blinkers on, it is important to recognise the positive stories 
when they happen. More than anything, many of the developments in 2017 have put airlines on a stronger footing 
for the likely challenges ahead.

Ryanair is facing potential strike disruption in a number of its key European markets as part of a push from pilots for 
better working conditions at the low-cost airline.
Yesterday, Europe's biggest carrier by passenger numbers was served notice of a one-day strike by some of its 
Irish-based pilots for December 20, while a German pilots' union said that it was also considering striking.
Ryanair's Italian pilots are also planning to walk out for four hours on Friday in what would be the lowcost airline's 
first strike by cockpit crew. The moves are part of a dispute between the airline and some pilots, who are calling for 
independent labour representation and better working conditions.
Ryanair said the "threatened action" represented less than 28 per cent of its 300 Dublin-based pilots. Tanya Powley

IRELAND-based Ryanair pilots are set to strike on 20 December in a dispute over workers' rights.
Members of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association, a branch of trade union Impact, said the oneday strike would either 
disrupt flights or generate substantial costs to the airline.
According to the union, 94 per cent of the airline's directly employed pilots backed the strike in secret ballots held 
over the last week.
Ashley Connolly, an Impact official, said: "This dispute is solely about winning independent representation for pilots 
in the company."
Ryanair apologised to customers in a statement, saying it would deal with disruptions "if, or when they arise, and 
we apologise sincerely to customers for any upset or worry this threatened action by less than 28 per cent of our 
Dublin pilots may cause them over the coming days". Ryanair added that while pilots were free to join unions, it 
would not recognise "an Aer Lingus pilot union".

BERLIN (AP) - A union called Tuesday on German-based pilots at budget airline Ryanair to strike in a dispute over 
pay and conditions, while the carrier's Irish staff voted for industrial action on Dec. 20.
The Cockpit union said that walkouts in Germany can be expected "any time starting immediately" but didn't give 
any specific timing. It said there will be no strikes between the afternoon of Dec. 23 and Dec. 26.
Cockpit hopes to force Ryanair into negotiations on what it calls "market-appropriate working and pay conditions" 
for the company's pilots. It said Germany's TUIfly, which like Ryanair operates a Boeing 737 fleet, offers such 
conditions.
Cockpit said that Italian and Portuguese pilot unions also have threatened strikes in the coming days. And the Irish 
trade union Impact said pilots in Ireland this week voted for a day of industrial action on Dec. 20 that will mostly 
involve captains.
Cockpit union chairman Ilja Schulz said it was giving Ryanair "a last chance" to avoid strikes by declaring its 
readiness to negotiate.
Ryanair said it had received no notification of any industrial action by pilots in Germany and suspects that "this is 
more PR activity" by the union.
"If any such action takes place, Ryanair will deal with it head on, but we will not deal with or recognize," the Cockpit 
union, it added in an emailed statement, "regardless of what action - if any - takes place."

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said it received on Tuesday afternoon a notice from the Aer Lingus pilots union IALPA 
of a 24-hour strike "by pilots directly employed by Ryanair" on Dec. 20. ADRs fell more than 2% intraday.
The carrier said in a statement it will deal with any such disruptions if, or when they arise, because of action taken 
by less than 28% of its Dublin pilots.
Ryanair said its pilots in Dublin can earn between EUR150,000 to EUR190,000 per annum for working a 5on/4off 
roster, and have been offered a 20% pay increase.

 The European Commission has approved the takeover of certain assets from the insolvent airline Air Berlin by the 
British low-cost carrier Easyjet PLC.
The commissioner in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said Tuesday that Easyjet's plans will not 
reduce competition.
"Our decision enables Easyjet to grow its presence at Berlin airports and start competing on new routes to the 
benefit of consumers," Vestager said.
Easyjet's move to expand its German services follows Air Berlin's collapse in August, which subsequently freed up 
airport landing slots.
Easyjet proposed to acquire certain assets and rights held by Air Berlin as part of its previous operations at Berlin 
Tegel airport, including landing and take-off permission at a specific date and time at Tegel airport and at some 
destination airports, according to an EUÂ statement.
The commission investigation concluded that Easyjet will continue to face strong competition from large carriers like 
Lufthansa AG and Ryanair Holdings PLC on routes from and to Berlin.
Shares in Easyjet were down 0.1% at 1,438.00 pence Tuesday.

Irish-based pilots employed directly by Ryanair and who are members of the IALPA pilots union served notice of a 
one-day strike on Tuesday in a dispute over the airline's collective bargaining system, the umbrella IMPACT trade 
union said.
The pilots, whom IMPACT said were mostly captains, will withdraw their labour on Dec. 20 in a strike the union 
predicted will either disrupt flights or generate substantial costs to the airline. It warned of further strike days if 
agreement is not reached on the airline's bargaining with staff.
In response to the vote in favour of action on Monday, Ryanair, which does not recognise trade unions, said the 
ballot represented less than 28% of its Dublin pilots and warned they would lose favourable rosters and 
remuneration benefits if the were "misled into industrial action." (Reuters)

Warning lights flashing at Norwegian Air; Breakneck growth and losses 
amid this year's favourable conditions raise fears for airline industry's

Earlier this year, budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle painted the face of Freddie Laker, the late pioneer of "nofrills" 
flying, on one of its aircraft as a signal of its ambitions to crack the lowcost long-haul transatlantic market. The fast-
growing group has become a disruptive force within the European airline industry over the past few years, leading 
the charge in bringing down the cost of long-haul flying and forcing rivals to respond with their own budget services.
But analysts and investors are starting to worry about Norwegian's rapid expansion, after a difficult year. "They are 
not profitable this year in what is a very good year for the airline industry," says Andrew Lobbenberg, an aviation 
analyst at HSBC. "The underlying business is losing considerable sums of money. This is not sustainable, 
something has to change."
Norwegian's desire to lead the market in low-cost transatlantic flights has led to turbo-charged growth over the past 
five years.
In 2012, it was relatively small in Europe, with 68 aircraft flying 330 routes. But that same year it placed a mammoth 
order for more than 200 aircraft and laid out plans to bring no-frills flying to long haul.
Warning lights flashing at Norwegian Air Breakneck growth and losses amid this year's favourable conditions 
raise fears for airline industry's disruptive force
This year alone Norwegian will add 32 planes to its fleet, leaving it with 145 aircraft working 512 routes. By the end 
of 2019, the total fleet will have increased to 193 - a long way from its humble beginnings in 1993 when it operated 
just three Fokker 50 aircraft on four domestic routes in Norway.
The speed of its expansion is putting pressure on costs. Analysts point to a poor summer, with Norwegian reporting 
a 6 per cent rise in unit costs for the third quarter. That followed a dismal second-quarter cost performance, with an 
operating loss of NKr863m ($104m).
Worries over Norwegian's numbers have also hit its share price: it has dropped 38 per cent in the past year. In the 
same period, easyJet shares have risen 44 per cent, Ryanair 22 per cent and IAG, which also offers long-haul 
flights, 42 per cent.
"[Norwegian's] unit cost has been creeping up. For a low-cost airline that's not really ideal," says Jonathan Wober, 
an analyst at CAPA - Centre for Aviation. According to Bloomberg consensus forecasts, the combination of falling 
unit revenue and increasing unit costs will result in an operating loss this year of NKr1.482bn.
Hans-Marius Lee Ludvigsen, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, says Norwegian's 2017 performance has been worse 
than expected, "particularly considering the rather profitable times among other European names in a year with low 
oil prices, low funding costs". He adds: "This should have been a year for an airline to make money, really."
Even in 2016, when Norwegian made an operating profit, its operating margin was 4.8 per cent - 16th of 28 listed 
European airline groups. This year, margin is forecast to fall to minus 4 per cent.
"If Norwegian is not able to improve its operating margins going forward, if there's a negative demand shock in the 
industry, then there's huge downside risks for them," says Mr Ludvigsen.
Leif Eriksrod, head of Norwegian equities at Alfred Berg, a top 20 investor in the airline, said it had been reducing 
its stake over the past year - from about 600,000 shares at the beginning of 2017 to 230,000 because of concern 
over its performance. "The strategy is good but the execution is not. They need to focus more on operations," he 
says.
For many analysts, Norwegian's problems come down to its glut of aircraft. "They are growing too fast and they 
can't execute it," says Mr Lobbenberg. "They are currently doing whatever they can do to absorb the planes. 
They've started leasing some to Hong Kong Express, selling older aircraft, setting up an Argentine airline.
"It's very much the tail wagging the dog in terms of the strategy, or more simply the entire strategy of the airline 
ends up being dictated by the fact they need to digest the aircraft order." Mr Wober agrees that while Norwegian 
has a valid starting principle - there are a lot of underserved and overpriced longhaul markets - the airline's 
execution has yet to be "fully convincing".
The rapid fleet expansion has caused a big increase in net debt - from almost NKr3.8bn in 2012 to NKr21.1bn in 
2016. Mr Wober points to concerns over the balance street "getting more and more stressed".
In September, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said Monarch, the UK's fifth-biggest airline, and 
Norwegian were running out of cash and perhaps would not survive the winter. Monarch collapsed in October after 
failing to find a buyer for some of its assets.
One of Norway's most senior bankers says: "Norwegian are in trouble. They are over-extended and it's clear that 
they have to do something. The danger with their business model is that their margins are pretty thin so they can't 
afford too big problems."
Norwegian could solve its troubles by selling all the aircraft it owns, he says, but "they don't want to do this as they 
believe there's a lot of value locked up there".
Warning lights flashing at Norwegian Air Breakneck growth and losses amid this year's favourable conditions 
raise fears for airline industry's disruptive force
Instead, he expects a series of smaller measures including increased leasing of aircraft and perhaps a capital 
raising. "They have to do something," he adds.
Norwegian has defended its recent performance, stressing that it is "building for the future". Tore Ostby, acting chief 
financial officer, notes that while its capacity growth will peak in 2018, it will then come down to more "sustainable" 
levels. "As we reach critical mass in long haul, I think we will prove to the market we have quite a strong set-up and 
the necessary scale to yield good returns," he told the Financial Times.
Mr Ostby says Norwegian has a "number of things" it can do if it needs to strengthen its balance sheet, including 
selling additional older aircraft, or further reducing the 17.5 per cent stake it owns in a Norwegian bank - both of 
which have helped the airline raise money this year.
Some analysts agree that fears are overblown and Norwegian is unlikely to succumb to a Monarch-like collapse. "I 
would say their current scenario from a financial perspective is dangerous but not life threatening," says Ross 
Harvey, an analyst at Davy Stockbrokers.
"The reason it is not life threatening is because they still own a large amount of aircraft in their fleet. With that 
equity, they still can perform a large number of sale and leaseback transactions."
Jomar Kilnes, a portfolio manager at Forte Fondsforvaltning, a Norwegian shareholder, says the airline needs to 
reduce costs. "We do think they will succeed eventually. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster but, in the long run, we 
think they'll come true and it will pay off."
However, analysts also agree that Norwegian will need to do something to improve its profitability if it is to make 
low-cost long-haul flights a sustainable business.
Blue sky thinking Established carriers hasten to compete After 50 years of failed attempts to make the low-budget 
transatlantic flight business work, the market finally seems to have taken off.
Since 2013, Norwegian has used Boeing 787 Dreamliners for services between Europe and the US. Canada's 
WestJet and Iceland's WOW Air have also entered the market.
Established carriers have rushed to protect their market share in response.
In June International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, launched Level, a low-cost service that flies from 
Barcelona to four destinations, including Los Angeles. Last month it disclosed plans to expand to Paris Orly airport.
Air France-KLM last week launched Joon for lower-cost long-haul flights, while Lufthansa continues to expand its 
"no frills" subsidiary Eurowings.
While Norwegian and its peers have proved there is demand for cheap transatlantic flights, there continues to be 
concern about whether this business can be profitable in the long term.
For Norwegian, the use of new narrow-body aircraft could make a big difference. New technology means the next-
generation narrow-bodies will be able to fly six to eight-hour routes at a lower cost than even the most fuelefficient 
wide-bodies.
As well as the narrow-body Boeing 737 Max 8, which it started using this summer, Norwegian is planning to use a 
new long-range version of Airbus's A321 to offer services between regional European airports and smaller US 
hubs.
But some remain sceptical. John Strickland, aviation consultant, noted that some of the new routes from regional 
European cities were likely to experience "significant seasonality with weakness in winter", which he said could be a 
problem for profitability.
Warning lights flashing at Norwegian Air Breakneck growth and losses amid this year's favourable conditions 
raise fears for airline industry's disruptive force
It is clear, however, that airline groups are focused on expanding this part of their business. Willie Walsh, IAG chief 
executive, has signalled plans for Level's fleet to rise to 30 by 2022, and expects the unit to be profitable this year.

Warning lights flashing at Norwegian Air; Breakneck growth and losses

Earlier this year, budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle painted the face of Freddie Laker, the late pioneer of "nofrills" 
flying, on one of its aircraft as a signal of its ambitions to crack the lowcost long-haul transatlantic market. The fast-
growing group has become a disruptive force within the European airline industry over the past few years, leading 
the charge in bringing down the cost of long-haul flying and forcing rivals to respond with their own budget services.
But analysts and investors are starting to worry about Norwegian's rapid expansion, after a difficult year. "They are 
not profitable this year in what is a very good year for the airline industry," says Andrew Lobbenberg, an aviation 
analyst at HSBC. "The underlying business is losing considerable sums of money. This is not sustainable, 
something has to change."
Norwegian's desire to lead the market in low-cost transatlantic flights has led to turbo-charged growth over the past 
five years.
In 2012, it was relatively small in Europe, with 68 aircraft flying 330 routes. But that same year it placed a mammoth 
order for more than 200 aircraft and laid out plans to bring no-frills flying to long haul.
Warning lights flashing at Norwegian Air Breakneck growth and losses amid this year's favourable conditions 
raise fears for airline industry's disruptive force
This year alone Norwegian will add 32 planes to its fleet, leaving it with 145 aircraft working 512 routes. By the end 
of 2019, the total fleet will have increased to 193 - a long way from its humble beginnings in 1993 when it operated 
just three Fokker 50 aircraft on four domestic routes in Norway.
The speed of its expansion is putting pressure on costs. Analysts point to a poor summer, with Norwegian reporting 
a 6 per cent rise in unit costs for the third quarter. That followed a dismal second-quarter cost performance, with an 
operating loss of NKr863m ($104m).
Worries over Norwegian's numbers have also hit its share price: it has dropped 38 per cent in the past year. In the 
same period, easyJet shares have risen 44 per cent, Ryanair 22 per cent and IAG, which also offers long-haul 
flights, 42 per cent.
"[Norwegian's] unit cost has been creeping up. For a low-cost airline that's not really ideal," says Jonathan Wober, 
an analyst at CAPA - Centre for Aviation. According to Bloomberg consensus forecasts, the combination of falling 
unit revenue and increasing unit costs will result in an operating loss this year of NKr1.482bn.
Hans-Marius Lee Ludvigsen, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, says Norwegian's 2017 performance has been worse 
than expected, "particularly considering the rather profitable times among other European names in a year with low 
oil prices, low funding costs". He adds: "This should have been a year for an airline to make money, really."
Even in 2016, when Norwegian made an operating profit, its operating margin was 4.8 per cent - 16th of 28 listed 
European airline groups. This year, margin is forecast to fall to minus 4 per cent.
"If Norwegian is not able to improve its operating margins going forward, if there's a negative demand shock in the 
industry, then there's huge downside risks for them," says Mr Ludvigsen.
Leif Eriksrod, head of Norwegian equities at Alfred Berg, a top 20 investor in the airline, said it had been reducing 
its stake over the past year - from about 600,000 shares at the beginning of 2017 to 230,000 because of concern 
over its performance. "The strategy is good but the execution is not. They need to focus more on operations," he 
says.
For many analysts, Norwegian's problems come down to its glut of aircraft. "They are growing too fast and they 
can't execute it," says Mr Lobbenberg. "They are currently doing whatever they can do to absorb the planes. 
They've started leasing some to Hong Kong Express, selling older aircraft, setting up an Argentine airline.
"It's very much the tail wagging the dog in terms of the strategy, or more simply the entire strategy of the airline 
ends up being dictated by the fact they need to digest the aircraft order." Mr Wober agrees that while Norwegian 
has a valid starting principle - there are a lot of underserved and overpriced longhaul markets - the airline's 
execution has yet to be "fully convincing".
The rapid fleet expansion has caused a big increase in net debt - from almost NKr3.8bn in 2012 to NKr21.1bn in 
2016. Mr Wober points to concerns over the balance street "getting more and more stressed".

failing to find a buyer for some of its assets.

Ryanair to face Italian strike
Ryanair to face Italian strike

Italian pilot union ANPAC on Wednesday said its Ryanair pilots had declared a four-hour strike for Dec. 15.
The strike is to take place from 1400 to 1800 GMT on that day, a spokesman for the union said. The union says it 
has 280 members, representing around 40% of the Ryanair pilots based in Italy. ANPAC said it was not yet clear 
how many of its pilots were scheduled to fly at that time.
Ryanair does not recognise unions and has long managed to avoid industrial action. But pilots have mobilised in the 
wake of the announcement of 20,000 flight cancellations by the Irish carrier, which it said was due to a lack of 
standby pilots.
In statement on Wednesday, Ryanair said, “This is the sixth time FIT/CISL or ANPAC has announced strikes 
by Ryanair pilots, only to postpone/cancel them later. We expect this latest threatened strike will also be 
postponed/cancelled since both FIT/CISL and ANPAC are Alitalia unions with no role in Ryanair.” (Reuters)

 easyJet PLC on Wednesday joined its peers in reporting an increase in passenger numbers and an improved load 
factor for the month of November.
easyJet followed Ryanair Holdings PLC, Wizz Air Holdings PLC, and International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, 
which this week all also reported rises in passenger numbers for the month compared to the prior year.
FTSE 100 budget airline easyJet said passenger numbers were up 8.1% to 5.3 million from 4.9 million in the same 
period last year. Load factor increased 2.6 percentage points in the month, up to 92.3% from 89.7% in November 
2016.
In the rolling 12 months to November easyJet passenger numbers increased 10% to 81.3 million from 73.7 million, 
and load factor rose to 92.9% from 91.3% a year ago.
For October, easyJet had reported passenger numbers were up 9.9% to 7.5 million from 6.8 million in the same 
period last year, with load factor also increasing 2.3 percentage points to 92.5% from 90.2% in October 2016.
On Monday, Irish rival Ryanair said it carried 5.6% more passengers in November than the same month last year 
with its load factor also improving.
Ryanair said it carried 9.3 million customers last month, up from 8.8 million in November 2016, raising its rolling 
annual traffic total to 128.7 million passengers, up 11% on a year before.
The increase came as Ryanair's load factor improved to 96% in November from 95% a year before.
Low-cost airline Wizz Air reported on Tuesday passenger numbers for November also increased year-on-year with 
numbers up on a rolling 12 month basis to the end of the month.
Passenger numbers for November rose 22% year-on-year to 2.2 million from 1.8 million, whilst in the rolling 12

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), the parent company for Ryanair, faces its first-ever strike as crews in Italy prepare to 
walk out as part of a push for unionization and company-wide contracts, and staff in six other countries also 
consider action, Bloomberg reported.
Pilots and flight attendants in Italy may walk off the job for four hours from 1 p.m. local time on Dec. 15, the 
business news agency reported, citing two unions. Workers in markets including Ireland, where Ryanair is based, 
will unveil ballot results in coming days, Bloomberg said, citing unidentified sources.
Pilots in Ireland, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Portugal and the Netherlands, as well as Italy, have formed local labor 
councils in recent weeks in order to press for collective bargaining outside Ryanair's own employee representative 
committees, according to the report. The move also opened up the possibility of strike action.

Narrowbodies continued to lead the order charge in October, accounting for 74 of the 116 new orders booked 
during the month, preliminary figures from Flight Fleets Analyzer indicate.
Deals for single-aisles comprised 51 Boeing 737 Max aircraft and 23 Airbus A320-family jets, including seven 
A320neos.
WestJet committed to five 737 Max 10s for delivery in 2022 and switched seven previously ordered -8s to the 
largest Max variant. Undisclosed customers account for the remaining orders for the re-engined narrowbody.
AirAsia and VivaAerobus ordered 14 and two A320s, respectively, with an undisclosed customer adding seven 
A320neos.
On the negative side, however, a total of 23 cancellations were recorded – 16 737s for Iraqi Airways and seven 
A320s for S7 Airlines. Lessors ICBC and Aviation Captial switched orders for A320s – for two and one, respectively 
– in favour of the re-engined Neo variant.
In the widebody segment, Ethiopian Airlines finalised an order for two 777 Freighters it had tentatively signed for at 
the Paris air show, with the Addis Ababa-based carrier announcing in November that it would take an additional four 
of the freighters. A further 10 777-300s were ordered by an unconfirmed customer during October.
After September’s 70-unit regional aircraft order high, commitments for another 30 were booked in October – all 
Embraer 175s. US regional carrier SkyWest Airlines followed up its September acquisition with the purchase of 
another 20 of the type, and American Airlines placed an order for 10 of the Brazilian-built jets.
At the end of September, the overall order backlog stood at 14,355, down 34 units on the previous month.
Maintaining the pace A total of 116 new aircraft were added to the collective backlog during October, as both 
the big two airframers secured narrowbody commitme....
Data shows that there were 129 commercial aircraft deliveries in October, two units up on the same month last 
year. Operators in the Asia-Pacific region took 55 aircraft, while North American and European carriers received 31 
and 21 units, respectively.
Narrowbody aircraft accounted for 85 shipments during the month – or 66% – while 30 widebodies were also 
handed over. Deliveries of regional turboprop and jet types each totalled seven units.
Boeing shipped 35 737s, including four Max 8s, while Airbus delivered 49 A320-family aircraft, including 17 
A320neos and five A321neos.
Recipients included Southwest Airlines, which took five 737s, including a single Max 8, while Aeroflot, China 
Southern Airlines and Ryanair each received four narrowbodies during the month.
The 30 widebody deliveries comprised 17 from Boeing and 13 from Airbus. Qatar Airways received three A350s, 
while Cathay Pacific took a pair of the Airbus widebody twins. Ethiopian accepted an A350 and a 787, and FedEx 
took a pair of Boeing freighters: one 777 and one 767. Air India, meanwhile, received a 787 – its 125th Boeing 
aircraft.

RYANAIR recorded a six per cent increase in passenger numbers in November, despite cancelling a raft of flights in 
the run-up to Christmas.
The budget airline served 9.3m customers last month, compared with 8.8m customers in November 2016, and 
rolling annual traffic to November grew by 11 per cent to 128.7m customers.
Load factor, the measure of how many seats were filled, was also up, by one percentage point, at 96 per cent.
Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said the improved numbers were achieved "on the back of lower fares".
The increase in customer numbers follows a turbulent time for the Irish carrier, which was forced to cancel 
hundreds of flights due to a mix-up surrounding pilots' holiday allocations.
The firm ran into problems after operating a record schedule and traffic levels during July and August, which it 
blamed for creating a "backlog of crew leave" - basically, staff still had too much holiday left to take in the second 
half of the year, meaning nobody was available to fly the planes.
In total, 2,100 of 103,000 flights were cancelled.
The Civil Aviation Authority said at the time that it was "furious" with Ryanair, and shares in the company fell after 
the regulator said it must change its compensation policy.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary issued an apology to shareholders and wrote to pilots urging them not to leave and 
promising better pay and working conditions.

BUDGET airline Easyjet is set to win unconditional EU antitrust approval to buy parts of failed German peer Air 
Berlin, sources said yesterday.
Easyjet will take on some of Air Berlin's operations at Tegel airport in the German capital for around (EURO)40m 
(£35m). It will also take on leases for up to 25 A320 aircraft, and about 1,000 of Air Berlin's pilots and cabin crew.
The move will allow Easyjet to further bolster its position in Berlin, pulling far ahead of Ireland's Ryanair and 
Lufthansa Group in the German capital.
The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by 12 December, declined to comment.
Air Berlin was the largest carrier in Berlin before its insolvency, followed by the combined Lufthansa Group airlines, 
Ryanair and Easyjet. German flag carrier Lufthansa has traditionally not focused on Berlin, instead focusing on 
hubs in Frankfurt and Munich.
Lufthansa's budget unit Eurowings plans to expand should Lufthansa be allowed to buy Air Berlin unit Niki.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.----------COMPANIES----------Rio Tinto appointed Non-
Executive Director Simon Thompson as its new chairman, effective from March 5 next year. Thompson will succeed 
outgoing Chairman Jan du Plessis, who will leave on the same date after stepping down in March to join BT Group 
as chairman, having served Rio Tinto for almost nine years. Thompson, a former Anglo American executive, has 
over 20 years' experience of the mining and metals industry, Rio noted. He is currently chairman of private equity 
firm 3i Group and was chairman of Tullow Oil between 2012 and this year. 
Former Xstrata boss Mick Davis had emerged as a frontrunner for the role, with other candidates including former 
Centrica Chief Executive Sam Laidlaw, who is currently on Rio Tinto's board and will become head of its 
remuneration committee. ----------Ryanair Holdings said it carried 5.6% more passengers in November than in the 
year-earlier month, as its load factor also improved. The Irish budget airline said it carried 9.3 million customers last 
month, up from 8.8 million in November 2016, raising its rolling annual traffic total to 128.7 million passengers, up 
11% on a year before. The increase came as Ryanair's load factor improved to 96% in November from 95% a year 
before.----------Transport operator National Express Group said it continued to enjoy positive trading across all of its 
divisions during October and November and that it completed two small acquisitions in November. National Express 
acquired a school bus and coach business with 204 vehicles, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and a bus operator in 
Madrid, Spain with 73 vehicles. The group said it expects the acquisitions to deliver 15% to 20% returns from these 
two acquisition. "We are encouraged by strong early Christmas trading in both our UK and Spanish coach 
businesses, with advanced sales higher than last year," National Express said.----------Euromoney Institutional 
Investor said it has acquired information and events business Seven Site Media Ltd, which trades as 
TowerXchange, for an undisclosed sum. The financial magazine publisher and events organiser said it acquired 
TowerXchange as part of the company's telecoms strategy to "facilitate industry collaboration" and trading in areas 
ranging from pricing to standards across the telecoms ecosystem.----------Walt Disney has re-engaged in 
discussions with Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox to purchase some of the media giant's assets, the 
Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. Comcast, the US cable group that owns 
NBCUniversal, and Verizon, the telecoms operator, have also expressed interest in Fox's entertainment assets and

buying businesses, the newspaper noted. The talks centre on the Twentieth Century Fox movie and television 
studio, international assets such as Fox's 39% holding in UK satellite TV provider Sky and India's Star TV, along 
with some US cable networks, WSJ reported. Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and sports network FS1 aren't 
expected to be sold in any transaction, the report said.----------Drugstore giant CVS Health agreed to buy health 
care benefit company Aetna for about USD69 billion in cash and stock. Including the assumption of Aetna's debt, 
the total value is USD77 billion. The proposed merger is expected to shake up the US healthcare industry, which is 
facing potential competition from Amazon. According to CVS, the deal will provide a uniquely integrated, 
community-based health care experience for its customers. The combined company will also be able to better 
understand patients' health goals, guide them through the health care system, and help them achieve their best 
health. Under the terms of the merger deal, Aetna shareholders will receive USD145 per share in cash and 0.8378 
CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. The transaction values Aetna at approximately USD207 per share, 
versus its closing price in New York on Friday of USD181.31. Following the deal closure, Aetna shareholders will 
own approximately 22% of the combined company, while CVS Health shareholders will own approximately 78%.----

YES JOHN LONGWORTH WTO rules would give us the freedom of making our own trade arrangements around 
the world, where 90 per cent of future growth will take place. Most of the world operates on WTO rules - it is 
perfectly sensible for us to do the same.
We would also have the ability to unilaterally do away with EU imposed tariffs, thus reducing the cost of food, 
clothing and footwear by an average of around 20 per cent. This would boost the economy by two per cent of GDP 
all in one go, and help the poorest in society.
Britain could also implement deregulation, take back our fisheries, and cut tax for business using our repatriated net 
contribution.
The alternative would be a potential disaster. Delay all this by having an interim period while paying for the 
privilege, possibly as much as £65bn by some accounts (£1,000 for every person in Britain), have no say in 
decision making, and likely be restricted from implementing the economic benefits of leaving.
In other words be worse off.
£ John Longworth is co-chair of Leave Means www.Leave.NO TOM BRAKE WTO terms mean instant tariffs on 
trade with our biggest market. Want to buy a German car? That will be an extra 10 per cent. Belgian chocolates? 
That's 20 per cent more. There are no WTO rules governing airlines, so unless a separate aviation deal were 
struck, planes would be grounded. Adieu easyJet, auf wiedersehen Ryanair.
That's not to mention the barriers put up by leaving the Single Market. Businesses exporting to the EU would still 
need to meet EU regulations, but what happens when UK regulations start to diverge, and businesses have to 
comply with two sets of rules? So much for getting rid of red tape.
Would the UK thrive under WTO rules of trade?; DEBATE
Meanwhile, the WTO itself is under siege. Donald Trump's "America First" administration has been vetoing 
appointments to the WTO's court, which could grind to a halt by next September. The White House is slapping 
unilateral tariffs on companies like Bombardier which it thinks threaten US businesses. If things continue like this, 
we won't have a WTO to which to default.
This isn't a future we should be considering. As a minimum, we need to stay in the Single Market. Better still, we 
should have an exit from Brexit.

Highlight: Low-cost airlines got a boost from last week’s Budget with increased air passenger duty only set to hit 
the upper end of air travel from April 2019.
Body
Low-cost airlines got a boost from last week's Budget with increased air passenger duty only set to hit the upper 
end of air travel from April 2019.
At the same time the duty will be frozen for economy passengers and short-haul flights. Add in the collapse of a 
competitor in Monarch, and the question is whether the outlook for airlines is starting to soar above the turbulence, 
and if so, which one will be the biggest winner?
Ryanair
Ryanair's recent suspension of 34 flight routes, affecting almost 400,000 passengers, generated plenty of negative 
press, with the firm blaming it on a ‘mess-up' in how it schedules time off for pilots.
‘The recent tribulations of Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, have been gleefully seized upon by the British 
press, ever keen to knock any business or individual that has dared to be successful,' said SVM's Neil Veitch.
‘Customers didn't necessarily love Ryanair itself, but they certainly did love the opportunities it offered. This remains 
the case and is the core reason we believe that demand will prove resilient, despite recent news flow.'
Citywire + rated Veitch points out Ryanair is trading on an estimated March 2018 price to earnings ratio (PE) of 
c13x and he believes the concerns over Ryanair's future are ‘misplaced'.
‘While there may be some short-term turbulence, this is an attractive valuation for a company that is still growing 
fast, has a rock-solid balance sheet and which will continue returning cash to shareholders.'
Ryanair's half-year results showed an 11% rise in profit to &euro;1.3 billion (&pound;1.1 billion) in the six months to 
30 September.  However, the disruption caused by the cancellations saw profits fall 2% profit to &euro;895 million 
year-on-year in the last quarter.
‘Ryanair isn't blinking though, and has maintained its profit forecast for the year,' said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at 
Hargreaves Lansdown.
Flying high: Which budget airlines are set to soar?
‘It's too early to tell whether there will be any lasting effect from the flight cancellations announced in September, 
though providing Ryanair can keep operational problems from arising again, it seems unlikely reputational damage 
will be an issue.' 
EasyJet
EasyJet's trading update covering the key months of July, August and September revealed the group carried a 
record 24 million passengers over the peak holiday period.
However, despite the demise of Alitalia, Air Berlin and Monarch, this good news was offset by EasyJet saying it still 
expects market capacity growth to be a headwind, its shares dipping slightly on the news.
EasyJet's full-year results last week were largely in line with expectations with pre-tax profits down 17.3% on higher 
costs and investment in the business.
However, Khalaf's colleague and equity analyst George Salmon noted the last set of results included a more 
positive outlook with shares rising 4.6% on the day.
EasyJet is expected to see low to mid-single digit growth in underlying revenue per seat in the first quarter and 
forward bookings for 2018 are ahead of last year at 88% for Q1 and 26% for Q2.
‘EasyJet's top line may look healthy, with revenues up 8% to &pound;5 billion, but this increase has come from the 
addition of 6.8 million extra seats and 59 more routes over the year,' said Salmon.
‘Due to the intense competition in the sector, EasyJet's average ticket price was around 8% lower than last year. 
Together with higher running costs and unfavourable exchange movements, this has seen profits squeezed.' 
Brexit baggage
Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, highlights there is yet another headwind that investors in both airlines 
need to factor in and that is Brexit.
Beyond the simple slowing in consumer spending and the weakening of sterling there is a greater worry around 
flight access in post-Brexit Europe.
Currently, Cook explained there is a single market for aviation as part of the European Common Aviation Area 
arrangements, which since 1997 has allowed EU members' airlines to travel anywhere.
‘Brexit takes EasyJet and others out of this arrangement,' he said.   
‘The aviation market is a market that is not being talked about widely in Brexit negotiations, yet but could easily be 
one of the largest sectors that goes over a cliff edge on 29 March 2019.'
He highlighted a bilateral agreement could be an option, however, this approach is likely to be time-consuming, and 
negotiations may stall over carbon and emissions trading, security and ground slot allocation.
‘Without a transitional deal, the sector will have to hope that material changes are made quickly so as to prevent a 
complete lock up of air travel from the UK.'

       ROME (dpa-AFX) - Budget airline Ryanair risks a fine of up to 5 million euros (5.9 million dollars) for failing to 
properly inform customers hit by flight cancellations, Italy's antitrust regulator said Monday.   In September, Ryanair 
attracted widespread criticism as it was forced to cancel tens of thousands of flights to accommodate a backlog of 
holidays for pilots.  Italy's competition authority AGCM said it ordered the airline to clearly advertise to Italian 
customers affected by the cancellations the options available to them.   In such cases, passengers have a right to 
obtain refunds or be booked onto another flight for free, but may also claim financial compensation, the regulator 
recalled in a statement.   Since Ryanair did not meet a 10-day deadline to tell AGCM how it was going to comply 
with the regulator's October 25 order, an infringement procedure against the airline was opened.   'The infringement 
procedure that was started can lead to the application of an administrative sanction ranging from 10,000 euros to 5 
million euros,' AGCM said.   Copyright dpa

NEW YORK (AP) - American Airlines reached an agreement Friday with its pilots' union to avoid having to cancel 
thousands of flights during the Christmas holiday season because of a glitch with the pilots' schedules.
The two sides had disagreed on how to overcome the glitch, which had left thousands of flights scheduled without a 
captain, a co-pilot or both between Dec. 17 and Dec. 31 at dozens of airports including hubs in Dallas, Chicago and 
Miami.
American said that the two sides "have put that worry to rest to make sure our flights will operate as scheduled."
American, the world's biggest airline, has about 15,000 active pilots and expects to operate more than 200,000 
flights in December.
The airline discovered the problem last week in its scheduling system, in which pilots bid each month for flying 
assignments based on seniority. The glitch let pilots drop scheduled flights - to take a vacation over Christmas, for 
example - even when there were no other pilots available for that flight. Normally such a request would be denied, 
especially during busy travel periods.
The airline had said it would avoid canceling flights by paying overtime and using reserve or on-call pilots. But the 
Allied Pilots Association lodged a protest against the plan, saying American was violating its labor contract by 
imposing a solution without union input, and was improperly restricting premium pay.
The union said it dropped its grievance after a day of talks that addressed the needs of both the pilots and the 
airline.
"With this agreement in principle, we anticipate that American Airlines will be able to maintain a full December 
schedule as planned for its passengers," the union said.
Union spokesman Dennis Tajer said details will be released after pilots see the deal.
American , pilots reach deal to avoid canceling flights
"Both sides got together to figure this out and now we are going to be flying jets over the Christmas holidays," Tajer 
said.
The trouble for American Airlines comes two months after Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said it would cancel more 
20,000 flights between November and March after admitting it "messed up" the transition to a new system for 
scheduling employee vacations.
Shares of American Airlines Group Inc., which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, fell $1.49, or 3 percent, Friday to 
close at $49.

Berlin is poor but sexy, noted one of its former mayors. Judging by the fuss, the same can be said for its namesake 
airline. Lufthansa plans to buy up Air Berlin. The EU fears that Germany's flag carrier will end up with too much 
market power. But the rest of the European aviation industry is likely to be quite relaxed about the prospect.
In October, the German group agreed to buy half of Air Berlin's assets for an estimated (EURO)210m, in a deal 
brokered by a government keen to minimise job losses in an election year, and to preserve as much German 
ownership as possible. The EU Competition Commission cannot ignore the implications of this move. Air Berlin 
would come with LGW, a domestic subsidiary, and Niki, an Austrian holiday airline, plus some aircraft.
After bedding LGW down, the combined group's market share within Germany would be 82 per cent. A quarter of 
Lufthansa's internal routes would become monopolies, notes Condor, a subsidiary of Thomas Cook which has 
opposed the deal.
As a remedy, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager might well prefer Lufthansa to sell off Niki, or some 
other routes that may include valuable take-off and landing slots at airports like Düsseldorf. Niki, as a standalone 
airline, would make for a simple sale - though analysts wonder whether it would survive on its own.
Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet will not care either way. Prices on domestic German routes have 
reportedly risen by at least a quarter since October when Air Berlin stopped flying. Ryanair has already expanded in 
Germany, with 10 aircraft based in Frankfurt from next summer, while easyJet awaits the review for its own deal to 
buy 25 planes from Air Berlin. These come with slots at Tegel, the Berlin airport business travellers prefer. Neither 
Lufthansa : passenger pick-ups Twitter : @FTLex Email: lex@ft.com
airline would welcome the continuation of irrational price competition from a floundering rival, whatever their public 
protestations about the carve-up.
All this future revenue promise has made Lufthansa pretty alluring to punters, too. Its shares have soared 141 per 
cent this year, and more than 40 per cent since Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August. Lufthansa has had 15 
deals, buying budget carrier Eurowings, reviewed by the EU since 2000. It is clearly pretty good at getting its way, 
and will most likely extend its record with a deal for Air Berlin.

Lufthansa must offer significant concessions to win Brussels' early approval of its Air Berlin purchase, a deal that 
regulators fear is likely to hurt competition and increase prices.
In October, the German group agreed to buy half of Air Berlin's assets for about (EURO)210m. The assets include 
Niki, Air Berlin's Austrian holiday airline; its regional carrier LGW; and 20 other aircraft.
The deal would create high market share and even monopolies on some routes, said Margrethe Vestager, Europe's 
competition commissioner in an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last month. EU 
regulators are concerned that the move will increase prices and cut consumer choice.
German airline ticket prices have risen significantly since Air Berlin was forced into insolvency in August, according 
to the German Business Travel Association (VDR).
To win permission for the deal, Lufthansa might need to sell some routes, and possibly even all of Niki, say two 
people familiar with the case.
It must provide clear-cut solutions to all the commission's concerns if it hopes to gain approval this year, say those 
people. Lufthansa had until midnight yesterday to make its offer to Ms Vestager. In an interim decision, regulators 
said the deal "likely threatens competition" within the European Economic Area.

"The companies overlapped on more than 100 routes, with combined market shares above 60 per cent on about 
half of those routes, including the creation of monopolies in a number of cases," it wrote. They also worried that 
"strong positions at congested [German, Austrian and Swiss] airports ... [may] raise barriers to entry for

Lufthansa has been party to 15 deals requiring EU approval since 2000.
The commission will be using a wellestablished process, looking at many of the same routes that were examined in 
2005 when Lufthansa bought Eurowings, according to people familiar with that case. The main difference is that 
officials are likely to insist on an upfront buyer for the slots Lufthansa will sell.
Assuming an offer is made, the EU will have until December 21 to approve the transaction with the promised 
changes or launch a probe, which would delay the deadline to late spring 2019.
Complex cases can be approved without an in-depth investigation. Two recent examples are AB InBev's merger 
with SABMiller, and Holcim's acquisition of Lafarge.
In addition to Lufthansa, easyJet, British Airways owner IAG and Condor, a subsidiary of Thomas Cook, also bid for 
parts of Air Berlin in September.
EasyJet won part of the airline's operations at Tegel airport, Berlin. Lufthansa received special permission from 
Brussels in late October to temporarily assume some of Air Berlin's leases, and a (EURO)150m loan guarantee was 
provided by the German state. Ryanair complained about the process to German and EU competition officials and 
did not bid for Air Berlin assets.
Lufthansa declined to comment. Condor said: "The dominant position that Lufthansa is seeking to further increase

Lufthansa must offer significant concessions to win Brussels' early approval of its Air Berlin purchase, a deal that 
regulators fear is likely to hurt competition and increase prices.
In October, the German group agreed to buy half of Air Berlin's assets for about (EURO)210m. The assets include 
Niki, Air Berlin's Austrian holiday airline; its regional carrier LGW; and 20 other aircraft.
The deal would create high market share and even monopolies on some routes, said Margrethe Vestager, Europe's 
competition commissioner in an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last month. EU 
regulators are concerned that the move will increase prices and cut consumer choice.
German airline ticket prices have risen significantly since Air Berlin was forced into insolvency in August, according 
to the German Business Travel Association (VDR).
To win permission for the deal, Lufthansa might need to sell some routes, and possibly even all of Niki, say two 
people familiar with the case.
It must provide clear-cut solutions to all the commission's concerns if it hopes to gain approval this year, say those 
people. Lufthansa had until midnight yesterday to make its offer to Ms Vestager. In an interim decision, regulators 
said the deal "likely threatens competition" within the European Economic Area.

Ryanair has agreed to recognise union representation for its pilots in a bid to avert threatened strike action over the 
Christmas period.
The low-cost carrier will recognise flight crew unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal.
The move follows a new pay structure offered by Ryanair to its pilots in October following major disruption.
At the time Ryanair said the new pay deal would add about &euro;100 million to annual crew costs, but would not 
significantly affect its “unit cost advantage”.
“Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may 
be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week,” says Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary.
“If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union process, then we are prepared to 
do so, and we have written today to these unions inviting them to talks to recognise them and calling on them to 
cancel the threatened industrial action planned for Christmas week.”
Ryanair states it will recognise pilot unions provided they establish committees of Ryanair pilots to deal with Ryanair 
issues.

European competition regulators have approved Easyjet’s purchase of part of Air Berlin’s business.
In October the airlines announced a deal for London-based Easyjet to pay &euro;40 million ($46 million) for most of 
Air Berlin’s operations at Berlin Tegel airport, where the British carrier would take over slots and the leases of 25 
A320-family aircraft.
“Easyjet's plans to buy certain Air Berlin assets will not reduce competition and we have approved it today,” says 
European commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
The commission’s investigation focused on Easyjet’s purchase of slots at Tegel and destination airports, and the 
potential for this restrict competition.
It concluded that the negative impact on passengers even at busy airports would be minimal, and that Easyjet 
would continue to face robust competition from Lufthansa and Ryanair.
Easyjet has said that the Air Berlin deal will make it the leading carrier in Berlin, where it already operates from 
Shoenefeld airport.
The European Commission is also assessing Lufthansa’s purchase of the Niki and LGW airlines from Air Berlin, a 
decision on which is penciled in for 21 December.

Viva Air has finalised an order for 50 A320 family aircraft, according to a statement from manufacturer Airbus.
The deal was originallysigned as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at the Paris air show in June.
The 35 A320neo and 15 A320ceo will be operated by the group’s airlines Vivacolumbia and Viva Air Peru.
Airbus says the Airbus-VivaColombia relationship began in 2012 when the airline began operations with A320 
aircraft. Vivacolombia, based in Medellin, has been an all-Airbus operator since, and today it operates 11 A320s. 
Viva Air recently launched Viva Air Peru, the sister airline of Vivacolombia based in Lima. Viva Air Peru currently 
operates three A320 aircraft.
Viva Air is a Panamanian headquartered group created by Irelandia Aviation and led by Declan Ryan. Irelandia has 
developed six low cost carriers around the world: Allegiant, Ryanair, Tigerair, VivaAerobus, VivaColombia and most 
recently Viva Air Peru. Combined, the airlines have a fleet of more than 420 aircraft.

Glitch has American looking for pilots for holiday flights
Glitch has American looking for pilots for holiday flights

DALLAS (AP) - A scheduling glitch has left American Airlines scrambling to find pilots to operate thousands of 
flights over the busy Christmas holiday period.
A spokesman for the airline said Wednesday that American expects to avoid canceling flights by paying overtime 
and using reserve or on-call pilots.
American isn't saying how many flights are affected, but the pilots' union says that about 15,000 flights were 
scheduled without a captain, a co-pilot or both.
American, the world's biggest airline, has about 15,000 active pilots and expects to operate more than 200,000 
flights in December.
Pilots bid each month for flying assignments based on seniority. The scheduling glitch let pilots drop scheduled 
flights - to take a vacation over Christmas, for example - even when there were no other pilots available for that 
flight. Normally such a request would be denied, especially during busy travel periods.
The pilots' union estimated that when the problem was discovered late last week, about 19,000 cockpit seats were 
left empty. The glitch affected flights between Dec. 17 and Dec. 31 from nearly a dozen airports including hubs in 
Dallas, Chicago and Miami.
"This is a potential crisis that we see well in advance," said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the union. "This is very 
unusual."
The union has lodged a protest against the company's plan to fix the mistake by tapping reserve pilots and offering 
overtime pay for some of the unstaffed flights. The union says American is violating its labor contract by imposing a 
solution without union input, and is improperly restricting premium pay.
Some nervous customers tweeted at the airline, looking for reassurance that their Christmas-travel plans would not 
be upset.
Glitch has American looking for pilots for holiday flights
American officials "expect to avoid cancellations this holiday season," said airline spokesman Matt Miller. "We will 
work with the (union) to take care of our pilots and ensure we get our customers to where they need to go over the 
holidays."
Miller declined to say how much American expects to pay out in overtime because of the glitch.
Despite American's can-do response, scheduling mix-ups can create serious problems in the airline business. In 
September, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said it would cancel more 20,000 flights between November and March 
after admitting it "messed up" the transition to a new system for scheduling employee vacations.
Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. lost nearly $2 after news of the glitch, although they still closed up 3 cents 
at $49.25. Rivals fared much better - Delta, United, Southwest and JetBlue all rose at least 3 percent.

 American Airlines has granted leave to too many of its pilots over the Christmas holiday period, putting thousands 
of flights in danger of being cancelled, the union for the airline's pilots said on Wednesday.
The Allied Pilots Association said in a statement it has filed a grievance over the pilot scheduling problem, which it 
said the airline disclosed on Friday.
It said the airline updated the situation on Wednesday, detailing the "significant holes" in the operation and 
"unilaterally invoked a solution for crewing affected flights".
The union estimated 15,000 flights scheduled from December 17 to 31 will be affected, according to the Dallas 
Morning News.
An American Airlines spokesman declined to say how many potential flights could be affected. Matt Miller was 
quoted by the Dallas newspaper as saying the airline expects to correct the problem and avoid cancellations.
Pilots are being offered 150% of their normal hourly wage to pick up some of the flights, Miller said.
The union, which represents 15,000 pilots, said management "unilaterally created their solution in violation of the 
contract," meaning neither the union nor the contract itself is a guarantee that the promised premium will be paid.
The problems for American Airlines are an echo of the 2,100 flight cancellations that Ryanair Holdings PLC was 
forced to make in Europe in September and October, followed by a reduction of its winter flying schedule, after what 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary called a  "material failure" in its pilot rostering.

The Economist magazine published a piece in September that pointed to the increased consideration of 
environmental, social and governance factors in mainstream investing. The piece noted correctly that the E- and G-
factors have gained more traction than the S-factor, which is often associated with employment rights. However, it 
is evident from recent events that mainstream investors would be unwise to discount the impact of S-factors on 
company performance strictly because of measurement difficulties.
Over the past few years, a number of companies have demonstrated poor social performance, and specifically poor 
employment practices. Sports Direct, the low-cost sportswear retailer, has been held to the fire for poor treatment of 
staff at its Shirebrook facility in Derbyshire and zerohour contracts. Uber, ride-sharing group, has been criticised for 
undercutting employment rights because of the way it contracts with its drivers.
Ryanair, the low-cost airline, has had longstanding industrial-relations problems with its pilots. These examples of 
poor social performance have led or contributed, respectively, to volatile share price performance, loss of a legal 
license to operate in London (though this is under appeal), and a significant drop in passenger growth.
Developments such as these raise concerns for investors hoping to find investee companies that create 
shareholder value. This is because such practices lead to operational, legal, reputational and financial risks that 
create uncertainty for investors, and sometimes negative financial impacts. As a result, investors are increasingly 
looking for qualitative workforce metrics that can help explain quantitative measures such as employee turnover or 
spend on training.
Investors would be unwise to discount the impact of S in ESG
One particularly helpful qualitative metric is employee engagement. A common thread with Sports Direct, Uber and 
Ryanair is that these companies have not been liaising effectively with their workforces: Sports Direct with its 
warehouse and shop workers, Uber with its drivers and Ryanair with its pilots. Two important indicators of effective 
employee engagement are mutuality - the idea that employers and staff can negotiate terms and conditions of work 
that meet the needs of both parties - and evidence of integrating staff feedback into how a company operates.
One question investors could ask to determine mutuality is: does a company's reporting reflect two-way 
communication between the employer and the workforce? To determine integration, investors could ask: does 
company policy - or better yet, practice - reflect any input from the workforce? Employee surveys can help on both 
fronts but often do not, as these surveys routinely fail to provide information that frames the employer-workforce 
relationship in a meaningful way.
Neither mutuality nor integration has been evident at the three companies mentioned. Sports Direct has taken steps 
this year to address claims it has failed to engage employees, notably appointing an employee representative to 
engage with its board. This move accords with the position of the Taylor review, an independent investigation into 
Britain's labour market, on employee engagement, and the UK government's recent recommendation that 
companies strengthen "the voice of employees and other stakeholder interests at board level".
While it might be harder to evaluate the S-factors than the E- and G-factors in ESG, it is important to do so and is 
not as hard as originally suggested. A bit of thought about how to use qualitative metrics could go a long way, and 
is likely, quite literally, to pay dividends for investors.

UK dividends: take cover

The Black Friday hypefest in the UK has prompted warnings of consumers stretching their finances. They are not 
alone. Dividend cover at British companies is surprisingly low, too.
On Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates, half the FTSE 100 will pay a dividend covered less than 2 times by 
earnings. A July survey by the Share Centre said cover across the FTSE 350 was at its lowest since 2009.
Five companies account for almost two-fifths of UK dividends. One is Vodafone, where forecast earnings of 7 pence 
a share are way short of the 13 pence forecast payout.
But dividends are paid from cash flow, not earnings. Vodafone's free cash flow is put at £4.4bn for the year to 
March 2018. That is ample to cover the £3.2bn total dividend. Even if it were not, borrowing to pay a dividend is do-
able for a year or so - as Royal Dutch Shell did last year, for instance.
The oil group also reduced its cash outlay by paying in shares. A third of its $15bn dividends were in stock. The 
resulting dilution was mopped up by buybacks, which can be spread out.
Special dividends are generally used for one-off distributions. But Ryanair pays them instead of regular dividends. It 
has returned (EURO)1.9bn in this way since 2008, arguing that it is a more appropriate mechanism for a cyclical 
industry. Better still is a payout ratio based on profit or free cash, rather than a progressive policy where dividends 
rise each year. BHP switched to a payout ratio in 2016.
Many would love to see the back of Black Friday. Plenty of companies should think about ditching progressive 
dividends, too.

Airbus struggles to attract orders for A380 aircraft
Airbus struggles to attract orders for A380 aircraft

The A380, the world's biggest passenger jet, is looking for a secondhand market and new orders, but prospects are 
not good. As Airbus battles for a fresh order for its A380 plane, the first double-deck Superjumbo has been put into 
storage.
Singapore Airlines was the launch customer for the A380 a decade ago. The first aircraft, code 9V-SKA, entered 
service between Singapore and Sydney on 25 August 2007, under the specially created flight number SQ380.
But that flagship plane was grounded in June. The jet has now been taken back to Europe by its owner, the leasing 
company Dr Peters Group of Dortmund. The plane has been painted white and flown to Tarbes Lourdes Pyrénées 
airport in South-west France.
The airport is a Ryanair base, close to Toulouse where the Airbus A380 was designed and built. Tarmac Aerosave, 
which operates the long-term airport parking facility, is part-owned by Airbus. The firm says it "provides the best 
one-stop-shop solution to your aircraft needs ... enabling the residual value of the aircraft to be maintained during 
the entire storage phase."
Airbus says of its biggest plane: "As the world's most comfortable, smooth and quiet airplane, no other travelling 
experience comes close. It is the passenger's favourite." While the A380 is certified for more than 800 passengers, 
airlines typically equip it with around 500 seats.
But the plane has always struggled to attract orders. When the entry into service was delayed, a number of airlines, 
including Virgin Atlantic, canceled orders. Just 216 have been delivered with around 100 more on order, about a 
fifth of the total for the Boeing 747 Jumbo.
The more modern Airbus A350 has attracted far more interest from airlines. While it has a lower capacity, the twin-
jet is a more efficient aircraft and is proving popular with passengers on Cathay Pacific, Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar 
Airways and Finnair.
Almost half the Superjumbos in service worldwide fly for Emirates, which recently took delivery of its hundredth 
A380. The Dubai-based airline is known to be considering an upgraded version of the jet.
Airbus struggles to attract orders for A380 aircraft
The A380plus would be capable of carrying 80 more passengers, partly by adding an extra seat to each row in 
economy and premium economy. While the A380 economy section is only 10 abreast at present, Airbus says an 
11th seat can be added to create a "3-5-3" configuration.
But the deal is stalled by a dispute over whether Airbus will guarantee to keep the production line open for another 
decade. The Dr Peters Group owns a further three A380s still flying for Singapore Airlines, plus five more in service 
with Air France.
Hi-Fly, a Portuguese airline that provides "wet-lease" planes to cover for other carriers including the recent Monarch 
airlift, is known to be interested in the A380. But there is concern about the "first off the production line" editions, 
such as the plane on the ground in Lourdes. Often they are heavier than later aircraft, with other flaws.
An expert in aircraft values described early planes of any model as "virtually 'R&D' aircraft", with the maker "battling 
to smooth out the initial kinks of their new kit and improve the latter examples coming off the line".

As late-night Stansted habitués will attest, flight EZY217 to Glasgow is often the last one standing on the tarmac. 
But for operator easyJet, being one of the last European low-cost airlines standing is anything but an 
inconvenience.
In the seven years since Carolyn McCall became chief executive, data from website www.protectmyholiday.com 
suggest the company has outlasted more than 100 rivals - including Monarch, Alitalia, Air Berlin, VLM, Moscow 
Airlines and Lufthansa Italia. Not to mention Norfolk Air. And, although Dame Carolyn is now boarding the shuttle 
bus for a new job at ITV, the staying power bodes well: after four years of falling fares, it means easyJet finally 
stands to benefit from less capacity in the short-haul market.
Industry watchers have long known that, in the case of capacity, what goes up must come down. Low fuel prices 
may encourage operators to offer more seats but capacity logically hits an inflection point, where competition 
makes adding more unprofitable.
It is impossible to plan for this but, as Europe's second-largest low-cost airline after Ryanair, easyJet has been 
telling investors that the strong must get stronger - and the weak weaker - for some time. Now it knows when: 2018.
In yesterday's full-year results, easyJet projected that capacity growth in its markets would halve in the first half 
because of Monarch's collapse, Alitalia's administration and Ryanair's staffing problems. In fact, some 98 per cent 
of Monarch's grounded flights are from Luton and Gatwick airports, where it was in direct competition with easyJet - 
EasyJet has the capacity to benefit from being the last one standing UK COMPANIES
which should now ease pressure on fares. And even when Monarch's airport slots are sold or reallocated, that 
capacity is unlikely to return in full: rival Wizz Air may add Luton flights, but to eastern Europe not Alicante; IAG may 
add Gatwick flights but go longer haul than Lanzarote.
With this reduction in competition, easyJet forecasts its first increase in revenue per seat for two years.
Analysts remain worried about costs, though, noting that a low-cost airline should not be expecting cost per seat to 
rise 1 per cent, excluding fuel.
They also point out that the (EURO)40m acquisition of Air Berlin assets will result in £60m of losses next year, plus 
one-off costs of £100m, for aircraft and staff. UBS expects this to "weigh on the shares". A bid for Alitalia assets and 
a need to set up an EU operation in Austria may be further excess baggage.
However, some of these costs are arguably what has kept easyJet standing. Its forecast cost increase in 2018 is to 
pay staff and crew - an investment in people that Ryanair tried to save on, until it resulted in 20,000 cancelled 
flights. EasyJet should also benefit if costs rise including fuel - it has far more ability, and balance sheet, to hedge 
fuel costs than rivals.
Shareholders may come to realise what Stansted passengers have known for ages: there is nothing wrong in being 
the last one standing, as long as you eventually take off.

FLURRY of company updates and strong consumer stocks helped Britain's FTSE 100 climb yesterday, with Easyjet 
rising.
ADefence and engineering contractor Babcock fell sharply after its results.
The FTSE rose 0.3 per cent, its best daily gains in three weeks, ending the day at 7,411.34 points following a weak 
start, while mid-caps gained 0.4 per cent.
British markets tracked gains across the European market, with UK investors showing few signs of nerves ahead of 
today's Budget announcement.
Budget airline Easyjet's full-year earnings were well-received, sending its shares soaring more than five per cent to 
the top of the FTSE.
The airline said it was benefiting from the collapse of rivals and problems at peer Ryanair, which have helped its 
pricing trends.
Consumer staples drove the strongest gains, with tobacco company Imperial Brands up 3.5 per cent as investors 
bet on a potential bid from Japan Tobacco after the Japanese firm named a new CEO keen on pursuing more 
overseas acquisitions.
Imperial has long been seen as a likely acquisition target, and the stock had its best day in 14 months after Jefferies 
analysts said a bid was more feasible under Japan Tobacco's new leadership.
There were some eye-catching falls after results, however. Babcock dropped 6.8 per cent as concerns over UK 
defence spending overshadowed first-half earnings in line with expectations.

EasyJet enjoyed a boost in growth due to the collapse of several of its rivals and problems at Ryanair that helped 
improve its fares outlook after a tough year in the cut-throat airline market.
The company signalled an easing in competitive pressures following the demise of Monarch and Air Berlin and the 
cut in capacity at Ryanair in the wake of the pilot roster problems.
The low-cost carrier said it expected revenue per seat, or RPS - a measure of fares - to increase by a low to mid-
single digit percentage in the first half of the 2018 fiscal year.
However, it posted a 17.3 per cent fall to £408m in headline pre-tax profits, excluding one-off costs, compared with 
the previous year, as it was hit by the drop in sterling and excess capacity in the market.
Analysts also raised concerns over the company's cost outlook. The airline said headline cost per seat, excluding 
fuel and at constant currency, was expected to increase by up to 1 per cent in 2018, largely down to crew and 
ground handling cost inflation.
Carolyn McCall, who is stepping down as chief executive at the end of the month after seven-and-a-half years to 
head up ITV, said she was leaving easyJet in a good position.
McCall set to leave easyJet flying high after rivals' failure Airlines ; Chief acknowledges easing of competitive 
pressures, despite headline profit fall
"If you look at the outlook, the trading momentum's good, RPS is up for the first time in a couple of years given how 
hard the environment has been ... it's the best time to leave a company, it's in good hands."
Dame Carolyn said rises in the oil price were likely to further help easyJet by placing pressure on weaker rivals.
"After several quarters of declining unit revenue trends, the market will be encouraged by this statement," said 
Stephen Furlong at stockbroker Davy.
Dame Carolyn said the company was benefiting primarily from Monarch's collapse, pointing to a 98 per cent overlap 
in routes with the carrier, which went into liquidation last month.
The results were published after a difficult year for European airlines, with fierce competition and rising fuel prices 
ratcheting up the pressure and resulting in three carriers entering administration over the summer.
New chief executive Johan Lundgren, a former Tui director, will join on December 1 in the middle of a busy time for 
the low-cost airline. It is in the process of buying 25 aircraft and other assets from Air Berlin and is in the running to 
snap up parts of Italian carrier Alitalia. Additional reporting by Nicholas Megaw See Lombard

Ryanair will add 18 routes to its Italian summer schedule next year, including 13 from airports serving Milan.
The budget carrier says it will operate from Bergamo to Burgas, Frankfurt, Lappeenranta, Plovdiv, Poznan, Tangier 
and Tel Aviv, and plans to base an additional aircraft at the northern Italian gateway. Ryanair also intends to extend 
its connecting product at Bergamo such that the number of routes available increases by 31 to 131.
Six destinations are to join the airline's Milan Malpensa network: Alicante, Katowice, Lamezia Terme, Liverpool, 
Palermo and Valencia.
Ryanair will also add three new routes from Rimini, to London Stansted, Kaunas and Warsaw Modlin, and two from 
Pescara, to Malta and Warsaw Modlin.
FlightGlobal schedules data indicates that Ryanair will compete with EasyJet on the domestic route between Milan 
Malpensa and Palermo in Sicily.

 easyJet (EZJ.LN), a UK-based low-cost airline, said headline profit before tax slumped in fiscal 2017 even as the 
carrier flew a record number of passengers, but added revenue trends for the first quarter have been encouraging 
as some capacity leaves the market. 
Profit in the 12 months ending Sept. 30 fell 17% to 408 million pounds ($540 million), while sales rose 8.1% to 5.05 
billion pounds, the carrier said on Tuesday. Revenue per seat was almost flat 58.23 pounds, and down 4.5% on a 
constant currency basis, easyJet said. Capacity increased 8.5% to more than 86.7 million seats.
"easyJet delivered a robust performance during a difficult year for the aviation industry," said Chief Executive 
Officer Carolyn McCall, who is stepping down at the end of this month. "easyJet's model is resilient and sustainable 
and we now have a huge amount of positive momentum which will enable the airline to continue to grow profitably."
Low-cost carriers have struggled this year with UK-based charter Monarch collapsing last month. And days before 
that, Irish carrier Ryanair faced heavy criticism over the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights due to staffing 
problems. 
easyJet said Tuesday rivals are struggling "to restructure their high cost bases or operate with inadequate financial 
resources," and that it's "well positioned selectively to strengthen its market positions."
The acquisition of part of Air Berlin's operations at Berlin Tegel airport for 40 million euros ($47 million) is expected 
to be earnings accretive by fiscal 2019. The carrier sees headline losses of about 60 million pounds on its activities 
at Tegel in fiscal 2018. The company has proposed a 24% cut in the dividend for fiscal 2017 but said it expects 
"dividend growth" next year. 
For the fiscal first half of 2018, the carrier said revenue per seat growth at constant currency is expected to be 
positive by low-to-mid-single digits, including the move of Easter from the third quarter but excluding the impact of 
Air Berlin. Forward bookings were ahead of last year at 88% for the first quarter and 26% for the second.

Highlight: EasyJet, the last airline standing in a troubled sector, propels FTSE 100 higher after saying it has started 
to benefit from the woes of rivals.
Body
EasyJet (EZJ) propelled the FTSE 100 higher after the budget airline flew 7% higher after saying it was starting to 
benefit from the problems of rivals.
With Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia all going bust this year and Ryanair forced to cancel thousands of flights, 
Easyjet has enjoyed record passenger numbers and has begun to push up prices as a result, said outgoing chief 
executive Carolyn McCall.
Although the annual report will not show this – with underlying profits before tax for the year to 30 September falling 
17% to &pound;408 million largely as a result of currency moves – Easyjet said it expected revenue per seat to 
grow by a low-to-mid single digit percentage in the last three months of the year. This is an improvement on the full-
year performance in which unit revenues per seat fell 0.4% to &pound;58.23.
‘When capacity comes out of the market, it benefits structural winners. We have taken advantage of capacity 
coming out,' McCall told reporters.
McCall (pictured) is leaving Easyjet to run ITV (ITV) with Johan Lundgren, a former executive at travel group TUI 
(TUIT) jetting in to take over.
She added that airline's prospects were bright. ‘You have to leave when it's on the up, and I think that it's very much 
on the up,' Reuters reported her as saying.
George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, commented: ‘What's really giving the shares lift is signs of 
a break in the clouds ahead. Forward reservations are up on last year, and the trend for rising costs and lower 
prices is set to reverse in the coming months.
‘With low fuel prices locked in, investors will be hoping the new CEO is joining at an inflexion point,' he said.
Easyjet shares, which hit &pound;13.65 in early trading, drifted down to trade 64p or 5% higher at &pound;13.42, 
helping the FTSE 100 to advance 22 points or 0.3% to 7,412.
Cousins leaving Compass
FTSE firmer as EasyJet spies break in the clouds
McCall is not the only boss on the move. Compass (CPG) dropped 3% to &pound;15.44 after the catering giant 
said chief executive and turnaround expert Richard Cousins would step down next March and leave the group the 
following September.
Dominic Blakemore, the firm's chief operating officer for Europe, will step up, the company said as it reported full-
year profits had been boosted 5.6% to &pound;1.7 billion by the weak pound.
Intertek (ITRK) added to the downward pressure and led the blue-chip fallers, sliding 4.8% to &pound;51.45, after 
the testing group clouded its full-year trading statement with news that US hurricanes would knock &pound;5 million 
off profits.
SIG (SHI) supported the ‘mid-cap' FTSE 250 index, which gained 0.2% or 46 points, after the insulation materials 
manufacturer warmed investors by sticking to its full-year forecasts. In the past four months slightly better trading in 
Europe has offset softer conditions in the UK, it said. The shares shot up 8% or 13p to 173p.
Severfield (SFR) put some steel in to the FTSE Small Cap index, with shares in the construction materials group 
jumping 10% after strong half-year results and a positive analyst presentation.
The stock has been under a cloud due to concerns over Brexit and its exposure to the London office market, but 
Andy Douglas of Jefferies maintained his ‘buy' rating, saying ‘there is a lot more to Severfield than meets the eye. 
Good progress is being made on many fronts.'
On currency markets the pound firmed to $1.3249 against the dollar after earlier dipping at news of public sector 
borrowing hitting &pound;8 billion, higher than the &pound;7.1 billion consensus forecast of economists.
Victoria Clarke of Investec said it set a gloomy tone for the chancellor ahead of tomorrow's Budget, though the 
figures also showed favourable revisions which reduced the borrowing of earlier months.

As it seeks to rebuild its reputation following the barrage of public criticism it received for cancelling thousands of 
flights this winter, Ryanair is facing another challenge: winning over the hearts and minds of its pilots.
The budget carrier has sought to lay the blame for the 18,000 flight cancellations on a one-off "rostering failure" – a 
crisis which, it admits, was "a mess of our own making". It is much less willing to accept any suggestion that pilot 
discontent played a part in the disruption.
Ryanair has sought to ignore pilot unions such as BALPA and IALPA – which it does not officially recognise in staff 
negotiations, and which have urged it to improve working conditions.
Nevertheless, the airline has tabled an improved pay and conditions package for pilots. These include "base 
supplements" of 10,000 ($11,800) for captains and 5,000 for first officers stationed at Ryanair bases.
A 12-month "loyalty/productivity" bonus of up to 12,000 for captains and 6,000 for first officers is also proposed, 
payable monthly from November 2017 to October 2018 based on targets being met, as revealed in a letter seen by 
FlightGlobal which chief executive Michael O'Leary sent to all 4,200 of Ryanair's pilots last month.
Speaking to FlightGlobal in London on 14 November, Ryanair's chief people officer Eddie Wilson said the new pay 
and conditions on offer to pilots were designed to show the airline's Boeing 737-operating competitors a "clean pair 
of heels".
He denies any link between the new offer and the rostering issue, and is dismissive of the suggestion that the 
airline is already haemorrhaging staff to rivals and lacking pilots as a result.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair 's drive to win over pilots As it seeks to rebuild its reputation following the barrage of public 
criticism it received for cancelling thousan....
"First of all, there is no pilot shortage, and there was no pilot shortage," he says, adding that Ryanair got into its 
present difficulties because "they [the pilots] were all on holidays", the airline having granted "too much leave" 
during September, October and November.
"It was a big shock what happened here as a management team, especially not seeing it [coming], which was 
sobering for everybody because we always prided ourselves on operational excellence," Wilson says.
To compound the problem, he recalls, a large number of pilots were "in the wrong place, because the way they 
were organising standby cover at that point was from a number of larger bases, rather than having standby cover 
spread evenly, the way we always did it".
In September, for example, Ryanair was "robbing Peter to pay Paul" by moving people around as each shortage 
occurred, rather than ensuring each base was adequately staffed.
Wilson adds that Ryanair had no "early warning" of the looming crisis because the cabin-crew roster "did not fall 
over during the summer", despite there being a similar days-on/days-off pattern.
The budget carrier has, he says, taken "decisive" action to prevent any further disruption than that already 
announced, by reintroducing a four-week roster as standard for its flightcrew and by "beefing up" the rostering team 
at its central office.
PILOT APPEAL
All new pilots joining Ryanair will automatically be given its new set of pay and conditions, and the carrier is in 
negotiations with the employee representative committees (ERC) at each of its 86 bases to convince them to 
accept the new terms. Twenty have already signed up, says Wilson.
However, Ryanair pilots at its biggest base, London Stansted, have rejected the new offer. As a result, the ERC has 
resigned and a new one has been formed. Wilson says the new ERC is on a "fact-finding mission at the moment" to 
decide "how they are going to continue negotiations, what they are going to do".
He says the Stansted base's existing contract does not expire until 2020, and defends the negotiating system the 
airline has put in place.
"We have had collective bargaining for the last 25 years. We have collective bargaining with our pilots locally in all 
of the bases," he says. "Deals expire at different times. It serves the pilots well."
Attempts to link the disruption to this improved offer is an example of people "jumping to conclusions", Wilson 
argues. He brands interventions by unions as an "opportunistic push" by them to gain recognition.
The carrier remains committed to negotiating solely and directly with pilots and has no intention of recognising 
unions.
"Ryanair doesn't have an issue with people being in a union or being members of a union [but] what they have done 
in other parts of the industry is destroy it – look at the people out on their ear at Monarch," says Wilson.
"What unions have done time and time again, because that's how they are made, is to take the dusty terms and 
conditions booklet that works for one airline and stuff it into another airline whether it's going to work or not, and it 
doesn’t work."
He adds: "Unions should actually welcome this, because ourselves and Norwegian and EasyJet and Wizz and all 
these operators have created thousands of jobs, and it's changed, and you have the bizarre situation of unions on 
the outside telling people not to take a 22,000 increase. It's like the world has gone mad."
His comments are refuted by BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair 's drive to win over pilots As it seeks to rebuild its reputation following the barrage of public 
criticism it received for cancelling thousan....
"It fits Ryanair's narrative to paint unions as 'outsiders' threatening the company's future," says Strutton. "This is 
nonsense, and any of the problems Ryanair is having with pilots are, in our opinion, entirely as a result of 
management failures.
"BALPA's goal is to ensure that airlines treat pilots fairly, whilst also remaining profitable. We work with companies 
across the country, including many low-cost airlines, holiday airlines, regional carriers, cargo, long-haul, the 
helicopter sector, and everything in between. The idea that we have a one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with 
these employers shows that Mr Wilson really doesn't know what he's talking about.
"The pilots are knocking at BALPA's door, not the other way around. Perhaps if he spent more time listening to his 
pilots' concerns, and less throwing mud at unions, maybe his pilots wouldn't be in revolt."
RECRUITMENT DRIVE
Wilson expects that, with Ryanair having "fixed" its rostering issues, there will be no more disruptions after March. 
He says punctuality levels are in the 90% region, and argues that the healthy profit reported in the carrier's last 
quarterly financial results indicate a return to "business as usual".
He adds: "When all the media and comment has died down, people now realise: 'Well, how can their results still be 
no change in guidance for the year?'"
Ryanair is now seeking to recruit an additional 1,000 pilots as it seeks to crew new aircraft being delivered over the 
coming years, bringing the total above 5,000.
Recruitment efforts are being stepped up not because pilots have been enticed away by rivals such as Jet2 and 
Norwegian but because a drop in Ryanair's aircraft deliveries in 2013 meant that "we didn't need as many first 
officers then, who would now be the people coming out of the training machine ready for command upgrade", says 
Wilson.
But changes can be perceived in the way Ryanair plans to hire pilots in the future.
Wilson says Ryanair will be seeking to employ more pilots directly than previously, as opposed to hiring them 
through recruitment agencies such as Crewlink. It also plans to upgrade 250 first officers to captains.
He asserts that the "overwhelming majority" of Ryanair captains are already "directly employed" by the airline.
All Ryanair pilots are hired under an Irish contract, apart from those employed in the UK who work under local 
employment law. The carrier also defines its aircraft as being Irish territory and therefore subject to that country's 
employment laws.
Over the years, Ryanair has fought a number of legal cases arising from this arrangement, with staff and ex-staff 
seeking to force the airline to adhere to local employment and benefit levels.
Wilson says the airline intends to continue with its contractual model. However, in the wake of labour disputes such 
as the Mons case currently being heard in Belgium, the airline will in future look at local conditions and "if there are 
differences in local employment law, we will look at those".
He adds: "The employment laws are largely the same [in Europe]. They are all driven by the same directives and 
where there are differences – if that's a big thing for our people – we will look at encompassing some of those 
differences under Irish employment law."
Overall, he contends, most employees are happy with the current contracting system because they can access Irish 
employment tribunals free of charge.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair 's drive to win over pilots As it seeks to rebuild its reputation following the barrage of public 
criticism it received for cancelling thousan....
Wilson says that the airline is already compliant with local jurisdictions, and that 85% of its staff in Germany pay 
German social insurance fees.
DEFIANCE
With its new pay, terms and conditions, Ryanair is, Wilson argues, an attractive place to work, especially given the 
breadth of its presence in Europe.
"If you're a 737 captain in Catania, there ain't anybody else opening [a base] in Catania, there ain't anyone opening 
in Cagliari, or Santiago de Compostela, so if you're from there, it's the best job in the world."
Interest from pilots formerly with defunct carriers such as Air Berlin and Monarch has been "swelled" by Ryanair's 
20% rise in pay, he says.
It remains to be seen whether Ryanair has done enough to fight off pressure to recognise the unions and make its 
offer too good for pilots to go elsewhere.

The airline industry has been catapulted from one social media firestorm to another this year.
Ryanair is the latest carrier affected after it sparked a furore by cancelling 20,000 of its 800,000 flights between 
September and next March, angering passengers and regulators. The Irish airline, Europe's biggest by passenger 
numbers, blamed the snag on a rostering failure that left it short of pilots. The problem was made worse by the 
company's initial reaction: the first, abrupt cancellation of 2,000 flights in September, with little or no notice, led to a 
torrent of criticism.
It disrupted the travel plans of 315,000 customers but Ryanair alarmed all its 18m passengers who had been due to 
travel in the following six weeks by failing to specify affected flights at the outset.
Ryanair's public relations disaster came months after customers of British Airways gave it a roasting for an IT 
systems failure on a bank holiday weekend in May, which stranded 75,000 passengers. A month previously, a video 
clip taken on a flight by US airline United Continental made international news: it showed a passenger being 
removed violently by airport police in Chicago. The flight had been overbooked and the carrier needed to make 
room for crew members who had to be on standby.

axed flights, a fight in the aisle and IT failu....
These incidents have added to public anger at many aspects of air travel, especially the proliferation of fees for 
changing flights, checking bags and even carry-on luggage.
They also raise the question of whether the industry, which is viewed as a model with regard to flight safety, is 
struggling with general commercial operations.
"I think ultimately that airlines are good at controlling the risk that can be controlled. Unfortunately, one of the 
biggest risks is the employee and passengers," says John Grant of JG Aviation Consultants.
He notes that customer-facing staff are "the face of an airline" and can "make or break" the long-term view of the 
company. "Now compare that with a highly sophisticated machine full of the latest technology, armed with lots of 
diagnostic equipment to alert people to potential breakdown," says Mr Grant. "The absence of a brain and personal 
agendas makes a huge difference."
While the three incidents were different, human error played a part in each. BA blamed its power outage on a 
technician employed by an outside supplier who shut down the "uninterruptible power supply" in a plant room at its 
London data centre.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, admitted that the budget carrier mishandled the initial communication of 
its flight cancellations. He also said it "could have responded sooner to a tightening market" for experienced flight 
officers. Since its rostering debacle, Ryanair has brought in new operations management and added resources to 
its pilot recruitment and rostering teams.
United Continental's dilemma was made worse by its initial tone-deaf statements that deflected legal blame while 
doing little to prevent brand damage; this was followed by ever more abject apologies that failed to assuage public 
anger.
Aviation commentators believe employee risk has increased owing to the trend for airlines to outsource functions 
that range from reservations to customer support to ground handling.
Andrew Charlton, a Geneva-based aviation analyst, says airlines are both capital intensive and people intensive, 
making the scope for good decisionmaking much harder.
"Add to that the fact that we pay the people on whom we most rely (flight attendants, check-in agents etc) the least 
and you can start to see the issues," he says.
"This also then extends to the need for expertise at very high levels of the operations: the chief pilot and the chief of 
ground operations and the head of maintenance are all regulated positions, so that is it difficult to get cross-
company expertise and experience even at quite high management levels."
BA's problem was compounded by its inability to email customers. Its systems were affected by the power outage.
John Strickland, a London aviation consultant, notes that the move to automation has risks.
"As we become more automated, what is the fallback system if most, if not all, of your automated systems are 
offline?" asks Mr Strickland.
"How do you communicate? In the past, not even five to 10 years ago, there would be more human intervention and 
less reliance on automation than there is today."
Others note that airlines' high focus on safety remains the priority in an industry that has long struggled with 
profitability.
'People factor' goes missing as PR dogfights hit airlines Aviation It was six months of hell for companies, with 
axed flights, a fight in the aisle and IT failu....
"Operating a complex business this safely is expensive," says John Luke, partner in KPMG's transport practice. 
"Airlines have endured long periods of losses and negligible profitability. So, as with many businesses, when there 
is cost pressure something has to give.
"In the airline sector that cannot be safety or hardware, so maybe more likely it ends up being the customer 
service."
Mr Luke adds that when disruption occurs, it may be how each airline deals with the event - rather than the event 
itself - that many customers remember. "Customer loyalty can actually be won in such circumstance," he says.

At the heart of most corporate crises lie the risks involved in managing people. After a host of scandals during the 
present century, companies recognise that policies and procedures count for very little if they ignore the human 
element. Efforts to tackle the matter are being made, yet disasters keep coming.
Whether it is the Harvey Weinstein scandal, which has exposed sexual abuse that goes beyond the entertainment 
and media industries, Ryanair's debacle over pilot rosters or the collapse of public relations consultants Bell 
Pottinger over controversial work by staff in South Africa, companies face reputational or financial damage if they 
do not get people matters right.
"People risk" can range from deliberate acts of fraud or sabotage to failure to follow rules, poor training, strategic 
miscalculations or someone opening a virus-infected email. Globalisation and technological change add complexity 
to the risks companies face and the speed with which problems can escalate.
Credit-checking group Equifax this year blamed "human error and technology failure" for one of the largest data 
breaches in history, affecting more than 145m people in the US alone. Its former boss said a single individual had 
failed to communicate to the IT team that a software patch needed to be applied. Lawmakers accused it of shoddy 
practices. Japan has had a string of disasters, from Kobe Steel (faked quality certification) to Nissan (unqualified

vehicle testers), Takata (exploding airbags) and Toshiba (accounting scandal). Analysts blame a culture of hiding 
mistakes, compounding human weaknesses.
The effects of risk management problems can be long-lasting. Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal, for example, 
has led not only to millions of cars being recalled and billions in fines, but has also damaged confidence in 
Germany's engineering excellence and thrown the future of diesel vehicles into question.
The purpose of risk management, however, is to allow risk to be taken safely. Innovation depends on risk. "The 
outcome of great people risk management is the success and resilience of the business," says John Ludlow, chief 
executive of Airmic, a UK association of corporate risk and insurance managers. Mr Ludlow believes companies 
have improved their people risk management, but there is more to do.
He says leaders need to define the corporate culture and standards of behaviour, and improve capabilities in 
technology and processes. They also need to build trust among customers, suppliers and employees.
Technology brings fresh questions, such as how ethics policies will work in the cyber world. "If you think about kids 
and cyber bullying, do you think adults are going to be any different?" asks Mr Ludlow. "Relationships are more 
detached and I think people will feel naturally easier about bullying another company with which they just have a 
digital relationship."
Research by Cranfield School of Management for Airmic identified five principles needed to achieve resilience: the 
ability to anticipate problems; adequate resources to respond to changing conditions; a free flow of information up 
to board level; the capacity to respond quickly to an incident; and a willingness to learn from the experience.
Hersh Shefrin, professor of finance at Santa Clara University in California, believes companies are not taking 
sufficient heed of the behavioural roots of risk-taking. "What we know from advances in the last 40 years is that 
people are highly imperfect when it comes to making judgments about risk," Prof Shefrin says. "It's important to 
understand how to improve decision-making, to identify vulnerabilities, by bringing together the quantitative tools of 
risk management with the qualitative psychological perspective."
For individuals, he says the problem usually starts with a bias towards excessive optimism, where people expect 
the future to be rosier than it is likely to be, and overconfidence, where they are too sure of their capabilities and 
tend to under-assess risks. In organisations, there is a tendency towards collective biases such as groupthink, 
where people reinforce and magnify individual biases.
Prof Shefrin says insights into how to handle these questions are contained in the work of psychologists Amos 
Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, popularised in Michael Lewis's book The Undoing Project, but their ideas are not 
being put into practice in a systematic way.
"We have pockets where we see improvement, driven by a tone at the top. But biases and psychological 
vulnerabilities are deep-seated and hardwired within us," he says.
Tackling all of this starts with corporate leaders: the boss can sometimes be the biggest risk-taker. Travis Kalanick, 
founder of ride-hailing app Uber, was ousted as chief executive in June after a series of problems, including sexism 
and lawsuits over stealing trade secrets that many saw as deriving from the macho culture he engendered.
The financial sector, which experienced behavioural scandals in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has changed 
how it recruits, trains, pays and monitors people. But problems still occur. Wells Fargo is still suffering from a 
scandal last year in which employees created hundreds of thousands of fake customer accounts. The US bank has 
replaced its chief executive, reshuffled its board, changed a string of senior executives and distanced itself from the 
aggressive culture of cross-selling it said had fed the deception.
Best practice needs the human touch Resilience in business is rooted in paying heed to staff behaviour, writes 
Brian Groom Business best practice needs the huma....
"Financial firms are getting better at managing people risk, but it's usually because someone has experienced a 
very bad incident, or because they have been regulated to do it," says Nicola Crawford, chair of the Institute of Risk 
Management, which has members in more than 100 countries.
An important aspect of managing people risk is enabling staff to challenge existing practices, yet the application is 
patchy. Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, the UK bank, was censured for attempting to unmask a 
whistleblower.
David Hillson, a consultant and author of The Risk Management Handbook, doubts whether progress has been 
made in managing people risk. "People have been looking for quick wins but I think the area is quite confused. If 
you look at what's been written by some of the big consultancies and professional bodies, the guidelines are 
conflicting in terms of definitions and proposed responses," he says.
Many companies now have safeguards in place, such as enterprise risk management (ERM) systems, and there is 
a global standard for risk management: ISO 31000. These can, however, create a false sense of security.
Yves Duhaldeborde, director of talent and rewards at consultancy Willis Towers Watson, points out that data are 
available via psychometric testing and staff surveys, which organisations can use to track risk propensity. 
"Organisations can do a better job with the data they have, calling data sources together and learning more in a 
positive way about employees," he says. Mr Duhaldeborde says companies put effort into employee engagement 
but "the people element is the toughest one to assess and control". He adds: "You always have employees who 
may be disgruntled, are not fully satisfied with their job, or feel they have not been treated fairly."

OMEONE once told me not to take too much notice of statistics and trends when it comes to picking big race 
winners as they are simply there to be broken.
s tomorrow's BetVictor Gold Cup (2.25pm) hadn't previously been a happy hunting ground for horses aged eight or 
over carrying more than 11st 6lbs until Taquin Du Seuil won 12 months ago.
Only one horse older than eight had won since 2003 (Little Josh in 2010) and in that same time period only Our Vic 
(2005) and Al Ferof (2012) had shouldered more than 11st 2lbs to victory. However, the class of former Grade One 
winner Taquin Du Seuil shone through and the nine-year-old bucked the trends in a thrilling finish.
I'm expecting the classiest horse in the line-up to get the job done again tomorrow as I am pretty sweet on the 
chances of KYLEMORE LOUGH on his first start for Harry Fry.
The eight-year-old enjoyed plenty of success for his former trainer Kerry Lee including victory in the Grade One 
Ryanair Gold Cup at Fairyhouse back in March 2016.
Things didn't really go to plan last season as he failed to win any of his four starts and connections decided a 
change of scenery was in order.
He joined Harry Fry, who incidentally has his string in unbelievably good form at present, back in May and this race 
has been the target since then as the horse historically goes so well fresh.
Gold standard Lough set to shine on first start for Fry THE PUNTER BILL ESDAILE'S BETVICTOR GOLD CUP 
1-2-3 RACING TRADER 1 KYLEMORE LOUGH 2 STARCHITECT 3 FOXTAI....
The best performance last season came on his first start of the campaign when beaten a head in a Grade Two at 
Ascot and he had previously showed the benefits of a break when winning at Haydock in February 2016 after a 
couple of months off.
Fry will have straightened out any physical problems hindering the horse and a mark of 154 looks fair considering 
he ran so well from 2lbs higher in a similar race here last December.
Annacotty won this race two years ago on his first start for Alan King after switching from Martin Keighley's yard and 
I've got a sense of déjà vu here.
All the fancy prices about Kylemore Lough have long gone, but 5/1 with Ladbrokes and Coral still looks fair to me.
There has been plenty of support in recent days for Irish raider Tully East who did us a great turn by landing the 
novice handicap at last season's Cheltenham Festival.
He would have blown the cobwebs away with a recent spin over hurdles last month and won't be far away, even off 
a 10lb higher mark.
The pick of Paul Nicholls' team is probably Romain De Senam who looks a different horse this season.
He is definitely improving having won both starts over fences recently, but will find things tougher now he is 12lbs 
higher in the weights.
Trainer Martin Pipe won this race eight times in his glittering career, so it must have been special to watch his son 
David land the prize six years ago with Great Endeavour.
One thing for certain is that the Pipe family know how to ready one for this contest and STARCHITECT could be the 
one who gives my selection most to think about.
He has slightly fluffed his lines on the big stage, having finished fifth on both of his two starts at the Cheltenham 
Festival.
Both were fair runs but the market on those occasions suggests more may have been expected.
That said, he looked on good terms with himself on his reappearance at Stratford and it may just be that he is about 
to fulfil his potential at the age of six even from a career high chasing mark.
My final vote goes to Nigel Twiston-Davies' FOXTAIL HILL who jumped He has such a likeable attitude that he is 
hard to leave out of calculations even racing off a 7lb higher mark.
The step up in trip should be no problem as he won over the distance here in January under today's pilot Jamie 
Bargary who steps in to replace the injured Sam Twiston-Davies.
He takes off a valuable 3lbs and the pair should take plenty of catching if returning on another going day.

Airbus yesterday clinched what is thought to be the biggest deal in its history with an agreement to sell 430 single-
aisle aircraft to four low-cost airlines linked to US investment group Indigo Partners for a headline price of $49.5bn.
The deal, which packages together aircraft for Wizz Air of Hungary, JetSmart of Chile, Volaris of Mexico and 
Frontier of the US, is believed to be the largestever order for aircraft by volume. However, immediately after the 
announcement on the penultimate day of the Dubai Air Show, Boeing's 737 Max beat Airbus's A320neo single aisle 
family in a separate race to secure a big order from Flydubai, the rapidly growing regional low-fare operator. 
Flydubai has committed to buy 175 of the 737 Max jets and taken options on 50 more, at a catalogue value of 
$27bn.
Neither order is yet firm, but both Airbus and Boeing said they hoped to sign final contracts in the next few months. 
Nor will the headline prices be the final cost, with discounts of up to 50 per cent on volume purchases.
Meanwhile, the fate of the world's biggest aircraft, Airbus's A380 superjumbo, remained uncertain. A $15bn deal to 
sell 36 aircraft to Emirates Airline was meant to be the highlight of the Dubai Air Show, rescuing the superjumbo 
from the threat of cancellation. But it was pulled at the last minute on Sunday, and only a deal with Boeing for 40, 
787 Dreamliners was announced. Airbus executives said yesterday that discussions continued. The A380 deal was 
to have been the triumphant farewell of John Leahy, Airbus's chief salesman, who retires at the end of the year and 
who has been an indefatigable supporter of the aircraft.

However, he will bow out after having clinched the $49.5bn deal with the Phoenix-based Indigo, and the four 
lowcost airlines in which it has invested. The private equity fund was founded in 2002 to invest in ultra low-cost 
carriers by Bill Franke, a well-known airline investor who backed Ryanair in the days before its stock market

Jozsef Varadi watched Hungarian flag carrier Malev's struggle to survive up close as chief executive in the early 
2000s, as Europe's lowcost air travel boom was taking off. Yesterday, he announced a multibillion-dollar aircraft 
order for Wizz Air, the Budapest-based lowcost carrier he later co-founded, signalling its entry into Europe's budget 
big league.
The deal to buy 146 Airbus A320neo aircraft, announced at the Dubai air show, underlines the scale of Wizz Air's 
ambitions.
It has sustained double-digit growth in passengers by targeting underpenetrated central and eastern European 
markets, where economies have grown at more than twice the rate of western peers in the past decade.
With rising incomes has come rapid growth in business and leisure travel, and Wizz Air has moved aggressively to 
fill the gap.
When the final jet from the latest order is delivered in 2026, the airline will boast roughly 250 aircraft, up from its 
current 87, and close to easyJet's current fleet size.
Mr Varadi, chief executive, said the order would enable the carrier to expand its share across Europe and beyond.
"The next-step technology aircraft will enable us to continue to lower our operating costs as we drive towards our 
goal of Wizz Air being the lowest-fare and lowestunit-cost airline in Europe." Yesterday's order carries a list price of 
Budget big league Monarch and Air Berlin woes a win-win for Wizz
$17.2bn but will be sold with an undisclosed discount, once the deal is approved by Wizz Air shareholders in early 
2018.
The order was negotiated as part of a 430-jet deal by private equity firm Indigo Partners, which holds stakes in Wizz 
Air and three other airlines, strengthening the carriers' hand in the price talks.
"Their position in the aggregate order will give them greater bargaining power and put them at the upper end of the 
price discount offered by Airbus," said Mark Simpson of Goodbody.
Mr Varadi's strategy includes scooping up capacity left by airlines such as Monarch and Air Berlin, which entered 
insolvency proceedings this summer. Wizz Air's ultra-low unit costs have enabled it to survive cut-throat competition 
in Europe's short-haul market, which faces a capacity glut.
Mr Varadi said earlier this month: "Europe will have to consolidate further. We are nowhere near where the market 
should be if you apply economic analysis. In the US, four airlines provide 80 per cent of the capacity. Europe is far 
more fragmented than that."
By exploiting a low-cost operating base in Budapest and registering for tax purposes in Switzerland, the airline has 
come closer than any of its peers to matching Ryanair's cost margins. Andrew Byrne

Jozsef Varadi watched Hungarian flag carrier Malev's struggle to survive up close as chief executive in the early 
2000s, as Europe's lowcost air travel boom was taking off.
Yesterday, he announced a multibillion-dollar aircraft order for Wizz Air, the Budapest-based lowcost carrier he later 
co-founded, signalling its entry into Europe's budget big league.
The deal to buy 146 Airbus A320neo aircraft, announced at the Dubai air show, underlines the scale of Wizz Air's 
ambitions.
It has sustained double-digit growth in passengers by targeting underpenetrated central and eastern European 
markets, where economies have grown at more than twice the rate of western peers in the past decade.
With rising incomes has come rapid growth in business and leisure travel, and Wizz Air has moved aggressively to 
fill the gap.
When the final jet from the latest order is delivered in 2026, the airline will boast roughly 250 aircraft, up from its 
current 87, and close to easyJet's current fleet size.
Mr Varadi, chief executive, said the order would enable the carrier to expand its share across Europe and beyond.
"The next-step technology aircraft will enable us to continue to lower our operating costs as we drive towards our 
goal of Wizz Air being the lowest-fare and lowestunit-cost airline in Europe." Yesterday's order carries a list price of 
Monarch and Air Berlin woes a win-win for Wizz Budget big league
$17.2bn but will be sold with an undisclosed discount, once the deal is approved by Wizz Air shareholders in early 
2018.
The order was negotiated as part of a 430-jet deal by private equity firm Indigo Partners, which holds stakes in Wizz 
Air and three other airlines, strengthening the carriers' hand in the price talks.
"Their position in the aggregate order will give them greater bargaining power and put them at the upper end of the

Ryanair launches programme to improve pilot management
Ryanair launches programme to improve pilot management
Business World (Digest)
November 15, 2017 Wednesday

Ryanair is to increase the number of pilots it employs directly and hire more staff to respond to their queries as part 
of a new programme to improve its pilot management, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
The airline in September cancelled 20,000 flights, saying rostering problems had left it without enough standby 
pilots to operate without significant delays. The resulting wave of passenger outrage threatened to undo the 
success of its 'Always Getting Better' customer service drive.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers has responded by promising pilots improved pay and conditions, 
which it says exceed those offered by rivals.
In the memo, Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said almost 20 of Ryanair's 86 bases had voted for the pay deal as 
of Friday. However, a number of bases, including its largest hub at London Stansted, have rejected the offer.
Some pilots have been using September's rostering issue to press for better conditions and the creation of a pan-
European representative body; Ryanair has long opposed recognising unions.
Ryanair said in the memo sent on Friday that it would "dramatically increase" the number of pilots employed directly 
rather than by outside agencies; over 180 first officers would be offered Ryanaircontracts in November, and 300 
more offers would be made by December.
It also said it had hired 1,040 new pilots this year, with the newest entrants receiving the better pay terms, and that 
it expected another 400 to join by March, bringing its crewing ratio to 11.0 pilots per aircraft from 10.5 by the time 
the busy European summer schedule begins.
Ryanair launches programme to improve pilot management
A new crew control mobile phone app has also been introduced to speed up the logging of absences, and the 
memo says Ryanair will double the number of base managers to eight in the weeks ahead to "respond even faster 
to even more pilot queries".
"We have launched an Always Flying Better (AFB) programme to fill the infrastructure gaps in pilot communications, 
admin support and effective structures for resolving pilot queries," Wilson said.
Wilson also said a problem with allocated leave for December had caused inconvenience to a small number of 
pilots.
Some pilots have said that a significant number of their colleagues have reported being assigned annual leave days 
without consultation.
Asked for more detail, a spokesman said Ryanair did not comment on its internal communications, or its direct 
engagement with staff. (Reuters)

When small is beautiful
When small is beautiful
Sunday Business Post

Length: 1446 words
Byline: Michael Murray
Highlight: Elephants don’t gallop, so investors may be better off seeking out opportunities among small companies 
with market niches that can be grown quickly from a lower base. But beware the entry route 
Body
Scale economies in large parts of the industrial, consumer and services sectors are usually essential for sustaining 
competitive advantage. That’s why, in value terms, the world’s main stock markets are dominated by companies 
with sectoral and/or global scale, and why most Irish investors focus on the few larger Irish-quoted companies that 
are well known to them and source their earnings from several markets: the likes of CRH in building materials; 
Smurfit Kappa in packaging; Ryanair, in low-cost pan-European air travel, and Diageo, owner of Guinness, in global 
spirits and alcoholic beverages.
All of these have delivered stellar returns for their shareholders in the long term due to scale economies and/or 
power brands. But, leaving aside the very high risk small venture capital sector, more exciting growth opportunities 
can be found in the small and mid cap sectors where highly profitable niches, pricing power and good growth 
prospects from low bases abound.
The growth rates of the successful, well managed minnows often comfortably beat those of the big fish. The small 
and mid-cap investment segment has delivered superior returns over the medium to long term compared to the 
mega stocks in the FTSE 100, the CAC 40, the DAX or the top five (in free float terms) in the Iseq. Given the low 
bases from which they have started, that isn’t surprising.
But for the serious and active private investor – often retired and with time and some spare cash to hand – small 
companies can offer interest, excitement, challenge and reward. Of course many will fall by the wayside through 
weak financial management or absence of a clear source of sustainable competitive advantage. But, as the banking 
crisis showed, it is not just small companies that can fall into the penny share category. After all, all of our banks – 
with market values in the double-digit billions – dropped to single penny values per share. In due course, I suspect, 
a few major multinational retailing groups will go the same way as technological disruption and unsustainable fixed 
costs and leverage take a progressive toll on that sector.
When small is beautiful
Clearly none of the Irish companies mentioned above fit into the small-cap category: CRH has a stock market value 
of €26 billion; Ryanair, €20 billion; Diageo, €64 billion, and Smurfit Kappa, €6 billion. There is no definitive 
description of a small or mid-cap range but internationally quoted companies with a stock market value of between 
€500,000 and €1.5 billion fit into the category.
On the Irish market we have plenty of businesses that fit, some of which offer value and opportunity. In Britain there 
are many hundreds more on both the main and alternative investment market. But from the point of view of share 
liquidity – an important consideration especially through hard times – the higher half of the €500,000 to €1.5 billion 
market cap range will usually be the more sensible entry point.
Most people are disinclined to invest time in choosing their own small and mid-cap investments. While I enjoy it as a 
retirement hobby, others might consider gaining their exposure through a professionally managed investment trust 
with an experienced management team, a decent track record and well-diversified portfolio.
Last week I met the managers of the Chelverton Small Companies Dividend Trust, an investment trust focused on 
companies with a stock market value of less than £500 million, and mostly much less than that. There are some 
fascinating gems in its portfolio of 73 companies – businesses which I and probably most readers have never heard 
of before but many of which are involved in attractive market niches and delivering good returns.
One of the disadvantages of companies in the small-cap sector is the question mark regarding the liquidity of the 
shares – a critical issue if you want to exit the company. The compensation has been that this sector has 
outperformed large-cap companies in the long term and the illiquidity of the inevitable portfolio “dogs” can be well 
compensated for by the superior performance and growth of the portfolio “stars’’. Chelverton Asset Management, 
founded nearly two decades ago, is a boutique fund manager. Its small company, dividend-focused investment trust 
concentrates exclusively on small and mid-sized companies with a high proportion of its investments listed on the 
Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and the remainder on the Ftse 250 and Ftse 350. The three-man management 
team has over 80 years of experience in equity markets between them, specialising in small caps – and in both 
private and publicly-listed equities.
The Chelverton Small Companies Dividend Trust was launched 18 years ago to provide shareholders with a high 
and growing income from dividend flows, along with the opportunity over time to achieve capital growth.
The historic portfolio yield has been 4.3 per cent (as at the end of last month) and the target for the dividend – 
which, unusually, is paid quarterly – is to grow it in excess of inflation over the medium to long term. Capital growth, 
while targeted is, if achieved, the icing on the cake.
The dividend focus forces the fund manager to assess potential investee companies from several perspectives: 
their cash (as well as their earnings) generating capability, their capital structure (avoiding excessively leveraged 
businesses) and, based on current and prospective earnings, the prospects of an annual and growing income 
return of 4 per cent per annum or more.
Since the Brexit decision, dividend announcements from Chelverton’s portfolio companies have held up well with 
over one quarter announcing annual dividend growth in double digits, ranging from 10-50 per cent, and mostly in 
the high teens to 25 per cent range; another one quarter of the portfolio delivering dividend growth in the target 4-9 
per cent range; 15 per cent in the 1.5-4 per cent range; 23 per cent unchanged; and 8 per cent cut.
So overall, the 4 per cent target has been comfortably met despite 73 per cent of earnings coming from a Brexit 
clouded market, only 13 per cent from Europe, and the balance from the rest of the world. The average crossover of 
portfolio holdings with the rest of the British equity income trusts has been 6.9 per cent.
It is impossible to say to what extent the Brexit issue has been baked into share prices at this stage. For quoted 
British companies, especially perhaps in the small to mid-cap sector, there have been and will continue to be both 
headwinds and tailwinds.
When small is beautiful
The tailwinds include low interest rates, significant monetary stimulus and potentially increased corporate activity in 
terms of takeovers with weaker sterling driving at least some of that activity. Set against that is political uncertainty, 
deferred investment decisions, lower short-term earnings expectations and imported inflation – all of which are 
squeezing margins.
The question is, do current price/earnings (p/e) ratios take these headwinds into account? Brokers’ consensus 
numbers for 2017 (for what they are worth) suggest that the Chelverton portfolio as at the end of September was 
being valued-based on brokers’ consensus numbers for 2017 on a prospective p/e of 12.9 times and delivering a 
historic yield of 4.16 per cent.
This looks like an attractive entry point for the long term in the sense that it appears to bake in some of the potential 
challenges for Britain, not least the current level of political instability.
But one thing is certain about this Chelverton trust – it has an eclectic range of investments that in themselves are 
worth doing due diligence on before investing.
They include a little footwear chain Shoe Zone, specialising in imports from China sold in secondary and tertiary 
retail stores in towns and cities in Britain and Ireland; the mezzanine debt financier Intermediate Capital, which has 
announced a 17 per cent dividend increase since Brexit; and the employee benefits provider Personal Group, which 
provides consultancy services on employee motivation and morale, employee engagement and benefit packages. 
But when it comes to small companies, investing from afar carries big risks.
Small companies by their nature tend to rely on a very small number of managers at the top and the opportunity for 
a private investor to assess them is limited. That’s why – with a few exceptions – I intend to keep my small 
company exposure down to a modest percentage of the total and ‘outsource’ some of it to a specialist small 
company investment trust that has a proven track record over a decent period.
I will start some fuller research on the names I have listed above and hopefully choose among them for my next 
small to mid-cap exposure in the weeks ahead.

Sir, Thank you for the excellent article on aircraft leasing ("Dublin on a high as China aviation sector surges", 
November 6). However, I am sure that Tony Ryan would agree if he could that Herb Kelleher, who founded 
Southwest Airlines together with a friend, was the true father of low-cost airlines.
The story goes that Kelleher drew out the business plan as a triangle of cities in Texas while dining with the friend in 
a San Antonio restaurant. The rest is of course history. The key to Ryanair's success is in part Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary's realisation that Europe was waiting for a Southwest-style airline after he visited them in 
the US.

Porto is to become the third airport at which Ryanair offers its connecting-flights service, joining Italy's Bergamo and 
Rome Fiumicino.
Ryanair says the service will be available at the Portuguese airport from January 2018. At booking stage, 
customers will be presented with a choice of 20 connecting services onto which they can transfer directly.
Connecting flights at Porto are among a range of new "Always Getting Better" initiatives the budget carrier has 
today unveiled at the Web Summit in Portuguese capital Lisbon.
Others include an upgraded Ryanair Rooms website, offering accommodation; a dedicated Chinese website; a 
personalised Ryanair.com, via the MyRyanair customer registration platform; and Ryanair Tickets, a partnership 
with digital start-up Coras through which bookings for London theatre shows and other events and attractions can 
be made.
"We are pleased to launch these latest digital initiatives under year four of our Always Getting Better programme," 
states Ryanair marketing chief Kenny Jacobs, noting the airline's aspiration to become the "Amazon of Travel".

Dublin on a high as China aviation sector surges; Ireland benefits from rapid

One of Ireland's most established markets is experiencing a renewed burst of growth.
As China's aviation sector expands rapidly to meet surging domestic demand for air travel, Dublin is emerging as a 
major hub for Beijing's growing ambitions in the aircraft leasing market.
Eighteen groups from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong are using the Irish capital as a strategic bridgehead in 
their push for a bigger share of the $261bn global market.
With about half the world's leased aircraft managed from Dublin and most leading lessors long present in the city, 
Ireland is already a global aviation finance centre.
But China's build-up marks a new turn in a booming market whose guiding light was Tony Ryan, the Irish tycoon 
who made his first fortune leasing aircraft in the 1970s and then went on to co-found Ryanair.
Ireland offers international lessors big tax advantages, although it is facing fresh competition from Hong Kong and 
Singapore as these cities look to woo business with new tax incentives.
Dublin on a high as China aviation sector surges Ireland benefits from rapid rise in aircraft leasing market but 
analysts question whether expansion can be sust....
The flood of Chinese capital into Dublin also comes despite Beijing's crackdown on overseas dealmaking, which 
has prompted speculation that Beijing is playing a long game to harness leasing expertise abroad before moving 
the industry home.
Chinese companies rely heavily on local managers and professional services firms in Ireland.
Globally, the market is also enjoying a big boost from Chinese capital, but this has provoked some concern that a 
growing pool of money may be chasing too few leasing assets, putting the sector at risk of a bubble bursting.
FlightGlobal, the industry analyst, estimates the capital deployed by aircraft lessors has grown by 51 per cent to 
$261bn over the past 10 years - of which $71bn has come from Chinese sources.
Significantly, close industry observers note a rise in prices and compression of yields on second-hand aircraft, 
saying some Chinese operators may not be properly pricing risk.
Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president at consultants Avitas near Washington DC, warns that an "unreasonably good 
situation" in global leasing could be upended by recession, disruption to trade under President Donald Trump's 
"America first" policy and other risk factors such as rising interest rates.
Although Mr Pilarski acknowledges that his outlook is "contrarian", he says: "There's a lot of new money that is 
coming in. These people have never lived through a downturn.
"We know why we had this overordering and this proliferation of people coming in: because we had this cheap 
money that can't make good returns and aircraft are sexy and promise to make good returns.
"You also had new players who want to enter it, the Chinese for example, but also the Middle Easterners … You 
have a bubble and you are waiting for the prick."
But China, driven by its own everincreasing market for air travel, continues to push to the fore. The International Air 
Transport Association believes China is on track to displace the US as the biggest aviation market by 2022, earlier 
than forecast previously and fuelling demand for leased aircraft.
In Ireland, the biggest Chinese move by far in leasing came in 2015 when HNA Group, the Hainan conglomerate, 
acquired Dublin-based Avolon, only nine months after its New York Stock Exchange flotation. The next year Avolon 
bought the leasing arm of US-based CIT Group, doubling Avolon's size and catapulting its (EURO)19bn portfolio to 
number three in the global industry.
This marks rapid progression for Avolon since its origins in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, yet Dómhnal 
Slattery, chief executive and founder, wants to go further still.
"Our aspiration is to be the number one player in world markets, which in simple terms would mean that we 
probably would need to double the size of the business again over the next five years," he says. "Given our scale 
now, we're more likely to pursue one other large acquisition, rather than a series of small ones … and my sense is 
that the next acquisition will happen probably when the industry is in a bit more distress or stress."
Other Chinese mainland and Hong Kong lessors are making inroads in Dublin. Groups such as Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China, China Development Bank, Bank of China Aviation, Bank of Communications, Goshawk 
and Accipiter are expanding in the city.
FlightGlobal data show that more than 1,100 Chinese-owned aircraft are managed from Dublin, about a quarter of 
the 4,300-strong global leasing fleet in Ireland.
Pat Hannigan, chief commercial officer in Dublin for CDB Aviation, an arm of China Development Bank, says the 
company has 200 aircraft, another 200 on order and a mandate to grow.
Dublin on a high as China aviation sector surges Ireland benefits from rapid rise in aircraft leasing market but 
analysts question whether expansion can be sust....
"There is no doubt about it that the Chinese are interested in this sector, have taken to this sector and they now 
want to go to the next level basically, which is what they're doing. They also want to expand our portfolio 
internationally and build our team," he says. Although Ireland's low 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate is a keystone of 
an economic strategy that has drawn legions of multinationals to the country, the linchpin for lessors is Dublin's 
network of double-taxation treaties with more than 70 countries.
Global airlines that lease from Ireland pay less withholding tax upfront thanks to these treaties, boosting the 
business case to trade from Dublin in a sector that makes low profit margins on very large assets. This provides 
flexibility to Chinese lessors, whose growing involvement in the international market also increases access to dollar 
revenues.
All of that comes on top of a 40-year record that dates back to Ryan's pioneering days in the industry, meaning that 
a large network of finance, debt issuance and accounting expertise is established in the city. Aircraft leasing 
sustains about 1,200 Irish jobs and the wider aviation sector contributes about (EURO)4bn to the national economy.
But Paul Sheridan, chief of Accipiter, another Hong Kong lessor in Dublin, says a key challenge now is for Ireland to 
ensure it stays competitive. "Ireland is in a really strong position. It has done really well but it does mean other 
people will inevitably try and repeat the trick."
There is no shortage of bullish forecasts for Chinese aviation. Whether the market can sustain its rapid growth will 
determine the fate of the country's lessors in Ireland.
Twin models Leasing origins the brainchild of Ryanair co-founder Ireland's expanding aircraft leasing market has its 
origins in a company called GPA, the brainchild of businessman Tony Ryan, which became a global force in the 
1970s and 1980s from its base at Shannon in the west of the country.
Ryan, who died in 2007, is better known today as co-founder of Ryanair, the Irish budget carrier that is Europe's 
biggest airline by passenger numbers.
In its day, however, GPA was a pioneering business that became the world's largest lessor at a time when the 
nascent sector was achieving global scale. But GPA overstretched itself. Plans for a flotation of GPA in 1992 ended 
in spectacular failure, leaving the business in a precarious financial state. Its assets were later acquired by GE, 
whose aircraft leasing arm GECAS is now the world's second-largest.
Still, GPA was a hothouse for a new breed of Irish business people who went on to establish Dublin as a global 
centre for aviation finance. Many remain in the leasing business to this day.
Ryanair remains Ryan's biggest legacy, says his biographer Richard Aldous, who adds that the airline "was almost 
like a hobby for him" at the outset. The business was established in the 1980s to exploit the deregulation of 
Europe's airlines when Ryan was at the height of his powers in GPA.
"After the [failed flotation], Ryanair is the thing that allows him to have another go. He effectively in the European 
context creates two industries. He invents the aircraft leasing model in Europe and the lowcost airline model. That's 
his legacy," says Mr Aldous.

Ryanair will be hit with up to (EURO)100m in higher annual pilot costs as the low-cost airline looks to recover from a 
rostering crisis that led to the cancellation of 20,000 flights.
In first-half results after the staffing debacle, the Irish budget carrier said pay rises to pilots would add (EURO)45m 
to crew costs in the current fiscal year and (EURO)100m in the following full-year.
Ryanair also warned of lower passenger growth next year, which saw it cut traffic forecasts for the next fiscal year 
to March 2019 from 142m to 138m. The grounding of 25 aircraft this autumn would also see projected fullyear traffic 
in the current fiscal year to March 2018 ease from 131m to 129m.
But Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers said the roster mess-up would have no impact on its profit 
forecast this year, maintaining full-year guidance of (EURO)1.4bn to (EURO)1.45bn. Ryanair sparked a furore this 
autumn with the cancellation of 20,000 of its 800,000 flights between September and March, angering passengers 
and regulators. A scheduled regulatory shift from counting crew flying hours over a calendar year - instead of its 
April-March fiscal year - left the airline short of standby pilots.
The airline has since focused on improving pilot retention by raising pay and hiring more cockpit crew. It has also 
invested in new operations management and added resources to its pilot recruitment and rostering teams. Post-tax 
profit in the six months to September rose 11 per cent to (EURO)1.29bn as revenue increased 7 per cent to 
(EURO)4.43bn.

I n the late 1950s, the writer Paul Bowles asked American tourists in Morocco what they hoped to find in the 
country. Almost all said "a sense of mystery".
The country has changed beyond recognition from the days when Bowles hosted Beat writers, such as William 
Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, on drug-fuelled voyages of discovery. But even in the age of cheap charter flights 
from Europe, it has managed to retain its attractiveness. It is no coincidence that Marrakesh, with its famous 
medina and labyrinthine markets, is by far the country's most popular destination for visitors, with almost 2.5m 
overnight stays in the first quarter of 2017, up 20 per cent from the same period in 2016.
Mohamed Sajid, Morocco's minister of tourism, acknowledges the importance of the country's heritage for visitors 
seeking the colourful and unfamiliar. "We are well endowed in terms of history, civilisation and culture," he says.
Previously mayor of Casablanca, Mr Sajid took on the portfolio in April this year, following a period of stagnation in 
which the growth of tourism was interrupted by the global financial crash, the eurozone crisis and the Arab 
uprisings.
This year, the sector is rebounding.
Tourism is essential for development, says minister Interview Mohamed Sajid is determined to attract more 
foreign visitors, says Siona Jenkins
"We are seeing considerable growth of 6-7 per cent compared to the previous year," he says. "We are hoping for 
11m tourists in 2017. If we can maintain this level of growth, we will have 15m or 16m tourists in three or four 
years."
The growth is important. Tourism employs 2.5m people in a country of 35m, where unemployment hovers at 9 per 
cent and labour force participation is estimated to be below 50 per cent. The sector was worth an estimated 6.6 per 
cent of GDP in 2016.
As part of the government's efforts to diversify the economy away from its over-reliance on agriculture, the ministry 
has put in place a 10-year plan, Vision 2020. It aims to double the size of the sector by 2020, increasing revenues 
to Dh140bn ($15bn) a year by the end of the decade.
Mr Sajid says the drive to meet these goals has been helped by an administrative reorganisation that has brought 
air transport into the tourism ministry. This has created a synergy, he says, adding that he is negotiating new direct 
air routes to the Americas and China to help expand markets.
The historic city of Fez has already benefited from this "synergy". In June, Air Arabia Maroc, Morocco's low-cost 
airline, began operating flights from the city to Marrakesh. The airline, in conjunction with the tourism authorities, is 
also developing new routes from Fez to a number of European destinations. Earlier this year, Ryanair added three 
routes from the city to Europe.
Mr Sajid says he hopes to increase direct air links to Andalusia in southern Spain, building on historic connections 
between the two regions to create a "cultural corridor" for visitors. "People who visit Seville, Cordoba and Grenada 
could continue their historic tour in Fez," he says.
The government has also invested in regional airports. A new terminal opened in Marrakesh in time for last year's 
COP22 international summit on climate change, doubling the airport's capacity to 9m passengers a year. A new 
terminal was also opened in Fez last May, enabling its airport to handle 2.5m passengers a year compared with a 
previous design limit of 500,000.
The airports are part of a more general investment in transport infrastructure by the government over the past 
decade. Coastal tourism in particular will benefit from the expanded network, Sajid says: "We have enormous 
potential that has not yet been exploited."
A particular focus of development is the southern Atlantic coast around the town of Dakhla. The area, a former 
Spanish colony, is a cult destination for kite- and windsurfers, who rave about its unspoilt beaches and strong 
winds. Mr Sajid said his windsurfing grandchildren alerted him to the town's reputation before he became minister.
"It is a very beautiful region, a special place that needs projects that are very sensitive to the environment," he says. 
He is hoping to establish direct flights to Dakhla from Europe (there are currently only infrequent links to Paris) and 
says that there are plans to upgrade a road linking the town to the city of Agadir further north.
The development is not without controversy, however. Morocco's territorial claim to Dakhla is disputed and the UN 
describes the area as a nonself-governing territory. Surfing enthusiasts appear unfazed by the dispute. The area's 
popularity for watersports is growing, with international kitesurfing competitions planned over the coming months.
At the other end of the country, infrastructure development is also benefiting Morocco's northern Atlantic and 
Mediterranean coasts. A new $2bn high-speed rail link between Tangier and Casablanca is due to open next 
summer, halving the journey time between the two cities. It will boost tourism as well as industry along the Atlantic 
coast. The line will eventually link up with Marrakesh.
By easing travel to new areas - and improving travel to popular destinations - the hope is that tourists will stay 
longer and spend more.
Tourism is essential for development, says minister Interview Mohamed Sajid is determined to attract more 
foreign visitors, says Siona Jenkins
The investments have created a solid basis on which the tourism industry can grow, says Mr Sajid. "There is a 
vision of development, a determination that exists across the country ... and tourism is part of it."

The historic city of Fez has already benefited from this "synergy". In June, Air Arabia Maroc, Morocco's low-cost 
airline, began operating flights from the city to Marrakesh. The airline, in conjunction with the tourism authorities, is 
also developing new routes from Fez to a number of European destinations. Earlier this year, Ryanair added three 
routes from the city to Europe.
Mr Sajid says he hopes to increase direct air links to Andalusia in southern Spain, building on historic connections 
between the two regions to create a "cultural corridor" for visitors. "People who visit Seville, Cordoba and Grenada 
could continue their historic tour in Fez," he says.
The government has also invested in regional airports. A new terminal opened in Marrakesh in time for last year's 
COP22 international summit on climate change, doubling the airport's capacity to 9m passengers a year. A new 
terminal was also opened in Fez last May, enabling its airport to handle 2.5m passengers a year compared with a 
previous design limit of 500,000.
The airports are part of a more general investment in transport infrastructure by the government over the past 
decade. Coastal tourism in particular will benefit from the expanded network, Sajid says: "We have enormous 
potential that has not yet been exploited."
A particular focus of development is the southern Atlantic coast around the town of Dakhla. The area, a former 
Spanish colony, is a cult destination for kite- and windsurfers, who rave about its unspoilt beaches and strong 
winds. Mr Sajid said his windsurfing grandchildren alerted him to the town's reputation before he became minister.
"It is a very beautiful region, a special place that needs projects that are very sensitive to the environment," he says. 
He is hoping to establish direct flights to Dakhla from Europe (there are currently only infrequent links to Paris) and 
says that there are plans to upgrade a road linking the town to the city of Agadir further north.
The development is not without controversy, however. Morocco's territorial claim to Dakhla is disputed and the UN 
describes the area as a nonself-governing territory. Surfing enthusiasts appear unfazed by the dispute. The area's 
popularity for watersports is growing, with international kitesurfing competitions planned over the coming months.
At the other end of the country, infrastructure development is also benefiting Morocco's northern Atlantic and 
Mediterranean coasts. A new $2bn high-speed rail link between Tangier and Casablanca is due to open next 
summer, halving the journey time between the two cities. It will boost tourism as well as industry along the Atlantic 
coast. The line will eventually link up with Marrakesh.
By easing travel to new areas - and improving travel to popular destinations - the hope is that tourists will stay 
longer and spend more.

The investments have created a solid basis on which the tourism industry can grow, says Mr Sajid. "There is a 
vision of development, a determination that exists across the country ... and tourism is part of it."

I n the late 1950s, the writer Paul Bowles asked American tourists in Morocco what they hoped to find in the 
country. Almost all said "a sense of mystery".
The country has changed beyond recognition from the days when Bowles hosted Beat writers, such as William 
Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, on drug-fuelled voyages of discovery. But even in the age of cheap charter flights 
from Europe, it has managed to retain its attractiveness. It is no coincidence that Marrakesh, with its famous 
medina and labyrinthine markets, is by far the country's most popular destination for visitors, with almost 2.5m 
overnight stays in the first quarter of 2017, up 20 per cent from the same period in 2016.
Mohamed Sajid, Morocco's minister of tourism, acknowledges the importance of the country's heritage for visitors 
seeking the colourful and unfamiliar. "We are well endowed in terms of history, civilisation and culture," he says.
Previously mayor of Casablanca, Mr Sajid took on the portfolio in April this year, following a period of stagnation in 
which the growth of tourism was interrupted by the global financial crash, the eurozone crisis and the Arab 
uprisings.
This year, the sector is rebounding.
Tourism is essential for development, says minister Interview Mohamed Sajid is determined to attract more 
foreign visitors, says Siona Jenkins
"We are seeing considerable growth of 6-7 per cent compared to the previous year," he says. "We are hoping for 
11m tourists in 2017. If we can maintain this level of growth, we will have 15m or 16m tourists in three or four 
years."
The growth is important. Tourism employs 2.5m people in a country of 35m, where unemployment hovers at 9 per 
cent and labour force participation is estimated to be below 50 per cent. The sector was worth an estimated 6.6 per 
cent of GDP in 2016.
As part of the government's efforts to diversify the economy away from its over-reliance on agriculture, the ministry 
has put in place a 10-year plan, Vision 2020. It aims to double the size of the sector by 2020, increasing revenues 
to Dh140bn ($15bn) a year by the end of the decade.
Mr Sajid says the drive to meet these goals has been helped by an administrative reorganisation that has brought 
air transport into the tourism ministry. This has created a synergy, he says, adding that he is negotiating new direct 
air routes to the Americas and China to help expand markets.

Highlight: Following solid half-year numbers at the airline, analysts see fair weather ahead  after a turbulent couple 
of years 
Body
It’s been a rough few months for Ryanair. In August, the company was at a high for the year of €19.39, but just two 
months later, it was languishing at €15.38 – with €2 billion wiped off the company’s market value as it tussled with 
pilots and struggled to answer piercing questions about its business model.
Last week, in classic Michael O’Leary style, the company came out with his response.
First came the mandatory humility: “We took some very tough and very painful decisions to cancel 50 flights a day,” 
he told investors. “We did disrupt a lot of passengers. We did suffer reputational damage.”
He could afford the humility, because the company’s half-year numbers were solid. Despite all the controversy, 
Ryanair’s profits had risen by 11 per cent for the first six months of its financial year to the end of September, a 
figure of €1.29 billion.
That’s in spite of a fall in traffic in the second quarter of that period and exceptional costs of €261 million.
[caption id="attachment_401834" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] O’Leary, pictured here at the Ryanair agm, has 
given an assurance that rostering and pilot issues will be resolved in “coming weeks and months” Barry 
Cronin[/caption]
The company, by its estimations and those of the equity analysts that cover it, was still on course for a full-year 
profit of between €1.4 billion and €1.45 billion.
Gert Zonneveld of Canaccord Genuity pointed out that the company is exceedingly resilient.
“I’m a little bit surprised that people would have been surprised, in the sense that it’s a business that has 
encountered a range of difficulties over the past 20 years – most of which have been external, such as terrorism 
Ryanair gets set for takeoff
events, the financial crisis, economic recessions and banks refusing to lend money. We have had all sorts of issues 
and the company has managed to go from strength to strength.”
Part of the brilliance of the Ryanair strategy, Zonneveld pointed out, is that in distinct contrast to its brash and 
boastful public relations approach, when it comes to the bottom line it tends to be extremely conservative. This 
gives it a cushion to absorb crises such as this.
“We know they’ll need to discount more aggressively, that they will have higher pilot costs, that they’ll have to keep 
load factors high, but for the company to turn around and say we’re going to maintain our full-year guidance 
suggests things are much better than the markets feared,” he said. “They built a significant amount of slack into the 
guidance and could absorb setbacks.”
So Micheal O’Leary has, once again, confounded the bad press and left investors and analysts positively purring. 
But with pilots and passengers still a little wary, the airline is by no means clear of turbulence.
Ruxandra Haradau-Döser, an equity analyst with Kepler Cheuvreux, said that while the headline guidance hadn’t 
changed, a number of the factors underlying that figure had changed.
“The results were in line with our expectations and the company is reiterating its guidance, which is a positive 
because some market participants probably expected the company to revise its guidance downwards, given the 
recent disruptions.”
Ryanair’s corporate reputation came in very handy here, she said: “They have a track record of being cautious in 
guidance.” Thus the simple act of reiterating their profit guidance for the full year has had the effect of reassuring 
the markets.
Nevertheless, there remain some unknowns. Haradau-Döser said that inside the company’s guidance, there were 
indeed revisions. “The volume growth is down and the cost base is up. This, the company says, will be offset by 
better price development, but on which we believe visibility is still weak,” she said.
Among the costs the most visible is the outstanding issue of pilots and unions. The company points out that the cost 
of the new contracts to pilots will be about €45 million for the year and an additional €100 million a year in the 
future.
That, however, was not certain, Haradau-Döser pointed out, since there was still quite a bit of legwork to be done 
on smoothing out this relationship.
O’Leary himself conceded “the need for us to improve pilot pay within Ryanair”. He admitted that while the offer of 
“increases of up to €22,000 for captains, €11,000 for first officers” had been accepted by 15 bases, “a number of 
the [remaining] bases, most notably Stansted, have turned down those increases”.
The current figures Ryanair is presenting will still keep personnel costs per aircraft substantially below its nearest 
rival, Easyjet. However, Haradau-Döser pointed out: “We cannot rule out future costs based on ECJ verdict . . . in 
our view, there is a risk that all over Europe, given the ECJ decision, there will be law suits by employees.”
Meanwhile, there remains an outstanding investigation by the German state prosecutors’ office into the tax affairs of 
550 pilots. At issue is what mandated social charges are due – charges that weren’t paid because of Ryanair’s 
freelance model, which left pilots assuming the airline was paying the social charges. It’s not an insignificant figure.
In Germany alone, if each of the 550 pilots spent an average of four years at Ryanair – generating a bill of €28,000, 
based on €7,000 per pilot per year – the bill comes to €15 million. It remains to be seen just how that issue will be 
resolved, and whether Ryanair will be asked to make a contribution towards the bill in Germany and elsewhere.
“In my view, those costs will be quite challenging to offset,” said Haradau-Döser. “They are a very cost efficient 
company so I’m sure they have worked on every cost item that they can address. I would expect that if personnel 
would increase, it would be quite difficult for them to offset.”
Ryanair gets set for takeoff
Difficult, but not impossible, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Mark Manduca.
In Manduca’s view, the entire pilot rostering issue – at least in terms of its impact on Ryanair’s share price – was 
overcooked.
“I always struggled to align the pilot issues with a circa €2 billion wipeout in market capitalisation,” he said, pointing 
out that the size of one-off impacts in terms of pilots’ pay and reimbursements for cancelled flights was always well 
below such a massive reaction.
The refund costs, which he pointed out affected less than 1 per cent of annual passenger volume, came to about 
€50 million from the one-off impact, while the salary offers to pilots cost nowhere near €2 billion in market value. 
Even multiplying the annual additional salary costs by 15 years wouldn’t bring you anywhere near the value lost on 
the shares, he argued.
“This is a business that has €5.2 billion worth of total costs, of which only circa €700 million is staff costs and in the 
context of €1.4 billion of net profit,” he said. “The math was telling you things hadn’t been impacted as much as the 
share-price decline [indicated].”
It was a view shared by RBC analyst Damian Brewer, who in a note wrote that the share price was still well below 
what it should be: “Price for a 15 to 20 per cent earnings-per-share disappointment already.”
Based on recent news-flow, he wrote the “recent reported unrest often seemingly generated by pilots already 
leaving the company might be limited at most and the priced-in [earnings per share] cuts look overblown versus 
today’s unchanged net outlook”.
Once again, it all came down to perception, and Manduca said the week leading up to the results had been a 
turbulent one for the airline and its investors.
“Going into the results, the feeling was that in recent weeks, the news-flow on pilots’ pay and cabin crew, and the 
succession of sell side downgrades had conspired to quell any lingering enthusiasm,” he said. “Expectations were 
pretty low.”
That was a buying opportunity for many investors. “Quite frankly, if you went into most of the meetings I had – and 
we spoke to 400 investors in the fortnight prior to the results – many of them stated they would like to buy more if 
they didn’t already hold too much.”
O’Leary’s presentation helped, Manduca said. “Overall it was the clinical delivery the market needed after weeks of 
uncertainty. It appeased the bears that felt the model had been challenged, and it closed the curtain on the drama.”
Prior to the results announcement this week, a couple of unanswered questions were still hanging over the 
company.
For example: why was the rostering problem not seen earlier? How will management work to prevent, or handle, 
mass workforce unionisation? Had plans to grow been impaired, particularly in Germany? And was Ryanair at the 
forefront of a major pinch in the number pilots for hire globally?
For Manduca, O’Leary answered those questions adequately this week.
[caption id="attachment_401833" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Staff leaving Ryanair HQ at Airside Business 
Park in Dublin in September Getty[/caption]
On rostering, the change from the old chief operating officer to a new one has calmed the markets, while O’Leary’s 
assurance that the rostering and pilot issues would be resolved “in the coming weeks and months” seemed to draw 
a line under the issue for most listeners.
Ryanair gets set for takeoff
Finally, on the global pilot shortage, Manduca pointed out that if, as it seems, there is going to be a global shortage 
of pilots at some point in the near future, then Ryanair is likely to be the first to feel it and to suffer it the worst – 
though O’Leary gave yet more reassurance that the company was working to manage it.
And then there’s the not insignificant matter of growth. In fact, both in perception and reality, he said, Ryanair could 
well be due a bounce.
“If you take a look still at how weak the year-on-year comparisons are for 2019 on pricing and ancillary growth, 
there’s still room for upside potential,” he said.
Not only that, but that revenue growth has the potential to look really dramatic in comparison to two years benighted 
by external and internal troubles – the pilot problems in 2017 and the terrorism and air traffic control problems of 
2016.
“Does anyone else in the industry have the lowest price point coupled with the weakest year on year comparisons?” 
Manduca asked.
That, he said, was the future for Ryanair. Rather than a story about what costs it can cut (or restrict), it’s a story 
about what revenue the company can grow.
He pointed to the ongoing talks with Airbnb, which could produce a tie-up worth more than €84 million in annual 
sales to Ryanair – a deal that could add some €1 billion to the company’s market value, by Manduca’s calculations.
For Gert Zonneveld, after a period of tumult – during which many critics argued that Ryanair would have to radically 
overhaul its entire operating model – the airline is likely to stick to its playbook and continue to grow.
“We could speculate on what the company will look like in the next few years, but [it probably won’t be] a million 
miles from now,” he said.
“It’s an exceptionally successful company. It has grown and continues to grow profitably, and it generates returns 
for its shareholders. Is there any need to change that model?”
Mark Irvine-Fortescue of Panmure Research said the same in a note this week.
Irvine-Fortescue wrote that while “the investment case now hinges [firstly] on pilot relations and the extent of any 
permanent inflation in Ryanair’s labour cost structure, and [secondly] on customer backlash from negative PR”, it 
could manage both.
“Given its market-leading margin, Ryanair can absorb a modest degree of both and we think the €100 million per 
annum pilot inflation flagged today is manageable and consistent with market expectations,” he wrote. “The model 
is not broken.”

Highlight: 123.ie’s Andrew Collins has an alarming new venture 
Body
His past two successes are reported to have sold for more than €100 million combined, and now Andrew Collins’s 
latest fledgling enterprise is scaling up. HomeSecure, where Collins is a director and has put in €100,000 of his own 
cash, has raised €1.5 million in fresh funding as part of ambitious expansion plans.
The monitored alarm service is a rival to Eircom’s Phonewatch. This new finance will be used to help boost its 
customer base, which has grown from 7,000 at the start of this year to 12,000 now, with turnover reaching €5 
million.
The funding round was handled by Orca Financial, an investment, life and pensions company founded by Stephen 
Byrne and John Molloy.
Orca was previously engaged by Collins and Ion Equity financier Ulric Kenny to raise €3 million via private clients 
for the well-backed energy company PrePayPower, and has been putting together finance for some other high-
profile ventures, I understand. The HomeSecure funding round was oversubscribed and came from several private 
investors. It brings funds raised since the business started to around €3.5 million.
The Dublin-based business was set up in 2014 by former Smurfit executive Colm Daly; Simon Murphy, who 
founded the original business that evolved into being HomeSecure, and former Eircom executive Richard Boland.
Collins, an accountant by training, joined Sarah Newman to build up Needahotel, which won a lucrative Ryanair 
contract, and life soon got more exciting. Collins had a stake of around 30 per cent there, suggesting he came away 
from its sale with around €20 million. He is thought to have made a further €20 million or so from the sale of 
insurance site 123.ie to RSA. PrePayPower, which has revenues of more than €90 million, has launched in the 
British market as Avid Energy.
In more gossip-oriented newspaper columns, Collins is occasionally namechecked not for his prowess as a serial 
entrepreneur but as the spouse of Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Luisa Zissman.
Roisin Burke on Business
Just who is behind the anonymous trust that owns a strategic site said to be in danger of jeopardising a major 
multibillion state transport plan? Malta-registered Rails Investments has just submitted hoards more information to 
planners as it seeks to press ahead with a massive development off Pearse Street in Dublin, where it hopes to 
attract a Facebook-type profile of tenant.
Rails Investments’ main shareholder and sole director is Ivan Dolan, an Irish national with an address in the Isle of 
Man. Last year, Dolan’s vehicle bought the 1930s former An Post warehouse on Sandwith Street from Eircom.
It has, however, been earmarked by Irish Rail as “critical to the delivery of Dart underground” – a €4.5 billion 
underground station and 7.6-kilometre rail link to the Heuston Station development. Irish Rail was unable to scare 
up the funds to buy it itself at that time.
Rails Investments applied to demolish it and build a seven-storey 110,000 square foot office block there. Irish Rail 
warned that if the development progressed before the construction of its Dart underground plan, that plan will be 
“significantly compromised” and Dublin City Council expressed “serious concerns” about its height. In new planning 
submissions, the owner’s architects say it will now reduce the building height back to four storeys and say they 
have adjusted its designs to accommodate Irish Rail’s plans.
[caption id="attachment_401820" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Martin Block[/caption]
Irish Rail tells me its firm intent when funding comes through is still to pursue the Dart underground plan. It will, if 
necessary, its spokesman said, seek the relevant railway order that gives it powers of compulsory purchase.
“We are reviewing [Rail Investments latest submissions] and if we have any further issue with it, we will raise it 
directly with Dublin City Council,” he said. “Anything that might impede the Greater Dublin Area transport plan would 
meet with stiff obstacles.”
The building is not a protected structure, but is described by council planners as “of some significance”. They 
demanded a conservation report, as well as lots of other further information, which has now been provided. The site 
is officially valued at €2.8 million on the local authority’s vacant site register, but finished and tenanted would be 
worth many multiples of that to its mysterious Maltese owner – if it gets that far.
What would be interesting is how much the state might have to cough up to acquire it, if it comes to that.
No mention in the sales blurb that 15 Merrion Square, located on one of the most gracious Georgian parks in the 
Dublin city, is the former Unite headquarters. The union was subjected to criticism over this property earlier in the 
year when it applied for planning for a luxury apartment development there, and sought exemption for the five-
storey building from the 10 per cent social housing requirement (not an unusual move in smaller planning 
applications). The building had also been vacant for some time.
At the time, it was involved in the protest against the chronic homelessness crisis in the city connected with Apollo 
House. However, it then emerged that Unite had actually previously offered the property for use to homeless charity 
Focus Ireland, but that organisation had turned the offer down as it was unsuitable for its needs, saying it required 
significant investment and refurbishment.
It’s now on the market for €4 million, double the price tag it sought in 2012 – reflecting the rapid appreciation of 
prices in these leafy environs.
“Following Unite’s move back to our offices on Middle Abbey Street in Dublin, it has become evident that we no 
longer require the use of our Merrion Square premises,” Alex Klemm of Unite said.
When asked whether some of the substantial proceeds might go towards tackling the homelessness crisis, Klemm 
said: “Unite, like all unions, is a non-profit organisation. As such, all revenue is used to run the organisation, 
delivering for members industrially and politically. The housing emergency in Ireland, and combating the far-right 
policies that have created it, are central to our political agenda.”
Roisin Burke on Business
The building’s current planning - put in, the union said, to make it a more attractive sale prospect - is for “a luxury 
home and to develop a five-storey apartment building to the rear”, according to the selling agents.It would suit 
residential, embassy, boutique hotel or educational use.
In some parts of this great nation, there are just two types of music: country and western. Martin Block, a name 
synonymous with Irish radio since the 1980s pirate days, knows this, and thinks a dedicated country and western 
music station could have real traction.
He and a like-minded consortium have applied to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, I hear, with a detailed 
expression of interest in a licence for this plan. It’s an idea that first surfaced around three years ago, when Block’s 
grouping was narrowly beaten in a pitch for the Sunshine FM licence renewal, and he hasn’t given up. The 
marketplace is seen by some as glutted with similar genres of middle-of-the-road music, and this could be a strong 
alternative niche.
Block and his fellow industry stalwarts Mike Ryan, Brendan Magee and Gerry Murphy have put an investment of 
around €1.5 million into their plans, and believe it could achieve 7-10 per cent audience share outside Dublin and 
around 4 per cent in the Dublin catchment, in complement rather than competition with local stations.
Around a dozen interested parties submitted expressions of interest to the BAI in August, as that body plans for a 
dramatically changing marketplace. Some 40 per cent of advertising spend is now digital, a massive carve-out from 
traditional radio, print and TV ads. One Irish broadcasting TV station is down about €1 million in advertising 
contracts that have shifted to digital, I understand, and media agencies are saying it has been a flat year for flagship 
broadcasters all round.
One radio boss told me that with Spotify and streaming, he has seen an approximate 30 per cent drop in 20 to 30-
year-olds listening to radio.
The recent JNLR stats don’t reflect this fall-off, but it is certainly a strong trend in other places, including Britain, 
where YouGov research shows a sharp fall-off in listenership among 16- to 25-year-olds.
Block, who was involved in stations over the years including Q102, FM104 and LiteFM, had a dramatic exit some 
years back at 4FM, where he was chief executive, but left suddenly.
He is now a consultant on various broadcasting projects. He still has a small stake at 4FM.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.----------COMPANIES----------Royal Dutch Shell third-
quarter results showed a huge improvement from last year, as expected, helping earnings in the first nine months of 
the year more than triple, but the oil major's shares struggled to gain ground as investors noticed that operational 
cashflow eased for the first time in almost two years. The largest London-listed company said current cost of supply 
earnings in the third quarter of 2017 amounted to USD3.69 billion, up from just USD1.44 billion the year before. The 
rise on an adjusted basis that strips out exceptional items rose at a lesser rate, but was still 47% higher at USD4.10 
billion from USD2.79 billion. "Earnings benefited mainly from stronger refining and chemicals industry conditions, 
increased realised oil and gas prices and higher production from new fields, offsetting the impact of field declines 
and divestments," Shell said. ----------BT Group maintained its interim dividend on Thursday as it also stuck to its 
full-year outlook after in-line half year trading, despite challenges in its enterprise units. 
For the six months ended September 30, pretax profit fell 22% to GBP1.08 billion from GBP1.39 billion the year 
prior. Revenue was broadly flat at GBP11.79 billion. Despite this the telecommunications firm said trading was "in 
line" and retained its full-year outlook of "broadly flat" underlying revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation of between GBP7.5 billion and GBP7.6 billion and a "progressive" dividend. BT kept 
its interim dividend flat at 4.85 pence per share.----------Ryanair Holdings reported a rise in customer traffic and load 
factor in October, despite the flight cancellations it was forced to make in September. Ryanair reported an 8% rise 
in customers to 11.8 million in October compared to 10.9 million the prior year, with load factor up 1 percentage 
point to 96% from 95% year-on-year.----------Ingredients supplier Tate & Lyle shares rose after the company lifted its 
annual profit guidance on a strong performance in the first half of its financial year. Tate said it now expects, after a 
strong performance in the first half, underlying adjusted pretax profit to be "modestly" higher than previously 
anticipated. The company's sales for the half, which ended September 30, rose 6.0% to GBP1.40 billion from 
GBP1.32 billion the prior year, whilst statutory pretax profit rose 26% to GBP161.0 million from GBP128.0 million. 
Tate said it has approved a 2.4% rise in the interim dividend to 8.40 pence from 8.20p, reflecting its confidence in 
the business.----------RSA Insurance Group said its net internet premiums increased overall in the third quarter of 
2017, and its profit in the year to date was ahead of the year before, despite underwriting results in the quarter. The 
general insurer reported its net written premiums for the nine months to September 30 across its entire operations 
were up 8.0% year-on-year at GBP5.08 billion from GBP4.82 billion for the same period the year before. RSA said 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Shell Earnings Jump But BT Interim Profit Falls 20%
its earnings per share for the year to date is "ahead of 2016", however the group noted that it was held back by 
underwriting results. ----------Lancashire Holdings turned to a loss in the third quarter as a result of hurricanes 
Harvey, Irma and Maria, which swept across the US and Puerto Rico in the period, as well as an earthquake in 
Mexico. Gross premiums written amounted to USD143.0 million in the period, up 32% from USD108.2 million a year 
earlier. Net premiums written were 15% higher year-on-year at USD106.1 million in the third quarter. Pretax loss for 
the three months to September 30 was USD136.4 million, compared to a profit of USD42.9 million a year earlier. As 
a result of the natural disasters in the third quarter - including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as an 
earthquake in Mexico City - Lancashire's net loss ratio for the third quarter of 2017 was 175.4% compared to 25.3% 
for the same period in 2016.----------WM Morrison Supermarkets said sales grew for its third quarter year-on-year, 
but showed a slowdown from the previous two periods of its current financial year. Total sales excluding fuel for the 
company rose 2.3% year-on-year for the quarter, which ended October 29, whilst including fuel sales rose 3.2%. 
Morrisons' like-for-like sales excluding fuel were up 2.5% on the same period last year and including fuel 3.4%. This 
included 2.1% revenue growth in the retail sector and 0.4% growth in wholesale. The company said like-for-like 
transactions were up 2.1% as it drew in more customers. However, the like-for-like sales growth figure excluding 
fuel of 2.5% was lower than the second quarter figure of 2.6% and the first quarter growth recorded of 3.4%. 
Including fuel, the 3.4% figure fell from 4.1% growth in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first.----------Playtech said 
its full-year results are now expected to be below market consensus after tough trading conditions in Asia and 
underperformance from its Sun Bingo unit. Although the Gaming division continues to perform well, the firm said its 
Sun Bingo contract remains "challenging" due to lengthier seasonality and the re-launch of the new Sun Bingo site. 
Playtech signed a five-year contract with News UK to operate the Sun Bingo and Fabulous Bingo websites and 
mobile services in 2015. In addition, Playtech said trading has been hit by "recent changing market conditions" in 
"certain parts" of Asia.----------Intu Properties said it formed a partnership with LaSalle Investment Management to 
jointly own the Intu Chapelfield shopping centre in Norwich, and reported strong tenant demand in the third quarter 
of 2017. The property group said it is acting on behalf of Greater Manchester Pension Fund and West Yorkshire 
Pension Fund, and LaSalle will acquire a 50% stake in the property for GBP148 million, representing a net initial 
yield of 5.0%, in line with the valuation of GBP296.0 million as at December 31.----------Randgold Resources said 
said its third quarter results were lower than second quarter, but added it remains well-positioned to achieve the top 
end of its full-year production guidance. The large-cap gold miner produced 310,618 ounces of gold in the three 
months to September 30, down 9% on the prior quarter while total cost per ounce rose by 17% to USD667.----------
Acacia Mining said Chief Executive Office Brad Gordon and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Wray have separately 
notified the company of plans to resign from their positions. Both will remain with the company until the end of the 
year to ensure a smooth transition, Acacia said. Gordon plans to return to Australia for family reasons, whilst Wray 
is pursuing an opportunity elsewhere. It has appointed Peter Geleta, currently head of organisation effectiveness, 
as interim chief executive officer, and Jaco Maritz, currently general manager of finance as chief financial officer, 
both effective from the start of 2018.----------Facebook posted big gains in profit as the company continues to face 
scrutiny over misleading content paid for by Russia-based operations during last year's US presidential election. 
The social media giant said Wednesday it earned USD4.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 79% over the 
same quarter last year. Total revenue was up in the three months ending September 30 to USD10.3 billion, a 47% 
increase. The results were posted as representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google are questioned by US 
senators this week in Washington over online content paid for by Russia-based operations. In Wednesday's results 
announcement, the California-based company said it had earned USD10.1 billion from advertisements during the 
quarter.----------Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse Group reported that its third-quarter net income attributable to 
shareholders surged to CHF244 million from last year's CHF41 million, and earnings per share jumped to CHF0.09 
from CHF0.02. Reported pretax income rose 80% to CHF400 million, and adjusted pre-tax income surged 90% to 
CHF620 million. Total operating expenses declined 11% compared to last year, reflecting lower general and 
administrative expenses and restructuring expenses. Net revenue for the third quarter, however, slid 8% to 
CHF4.972 billion, and adjusted net revenue were down 2% to CHF5 billion. The decrease in revenue primarily 
reflect lower net revenues in Swiss Universal Bank and Global Markets and increased negative net revenues in the 
Strategic Resolution Unit.----------MARKETS----------London share prices were slightly higher as the pound softened 
ahead of a Bank of England interest rate decision at 1200 GMT. Shell shares were up 0.9%, while BT shares were 
down 1.4%. Wall Street was pointed lower with major indices indicated down 0.1%.----------FTSE 100: up 0.3% at

 European stocks are likely to open higher on Wednesday amid optimism over global growth after a gauge of US 
consumer confidence jumped to a near 17-year high in October and a private survey signaled improvement in 
manufacturing operating conditions across China.
The US Federal Reserve announces its monetary policy decision later today. While no policy changes are 
expected, investors may get some clues in the policy statement as to whether the US central bank is on track to 
raise rates in December.
The Bank of England will reveal its interest-rate decision on Thursday, with traders bracing for what could be the 
central bank's first rate increase in more than a decade.
According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the BoE is set to lift the policy rate by 25 basis 
points this month and again every six months until it reaches 2%.
Across the Atlantic, US President Donald Trump plans to announce his nominee as the next Fed Chair on 
Thursday. Media reports suggest that Trump intends to nominate Fed Governor Jerome Powell to replace current 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen.
The closely watched monthly jobs report due to be released on Friday is also likely to be in focus, with employment 
expected to jump by 300,000 jobs in October.
Meanwhile, data released earlier in the day showed that UK shop price deflation remained at a four-year low in 
October. The BRC-Nielsen shop price index dropped 0.1%, the same annual rate as seen in September.
Asian stocks are broadly higher and Brent oil prices hovered near two-year highs while the dollar gained ground 
ahead of the FOMC decision. The China Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI for October came in unchanged at 51.0, 
easing concerns of a slowdown.
European Shares Seen Up On Growth Optimism
US stocks rose overnight, driven by food companies as Kellogg and Mondelez reported better than expected third-
quarter results and upbeat consumer confidence data strengthened optimism about the economy.
The Dow and the S&P 500 inched up around 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4% to reach a fresh 
record closing high.
European markets also advanced on Tuesday, with well-received earnings updates from the likes of BP and 
Ryanair as well as polls suggesting rising support for Spanish unity in Catalonia helping underpin investor 
sentiment.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.3% to end at more-than-five-month high. France's CAC 40 index 
gained 0.2% and the UK's FTSE 100 inched up 0.1% while the German market was closed for the Reformation Day 
holiday.

       NEW DELHI (dpa-AFX) - Indian shares look set to open higher on Wednesday after a gauge of core sector 
growth hit a six-month high in September and India's ranking in the World Bank ease of doing business survey for 
2018 climbed a record 30 notches to 100.  India's core sector output grew 5.2 percent in September, compared with 
4.4 percent in August and 5.3 percent in September last year, adding to signs that the economy is picking up pace 
after a disappointing first quarter.   Separately, India has jumped 30 places to 100th position in the World Bank's 
'ease of doing business' ranking, reflecting a slew of reforms implemented in the last four years.   'I think it is 
possible to take India to the first 50 ranks in Doing Business ranking, as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi,' said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley at a press conference in Delhi. 
 On the earnings front, Bharti Airtel reported a lower-than-expected fall in quarterly profit and Syndicate Bank's Q2 
profit jumped nearly 28 percent while budget carrier IndiGo's parent InterGlobe Aviation reported a four-fold jump in 
quarterly profit, beating analysts' estimates. Hero MotoCorp and Tech Mahindra are due to unveil their quarterly 
earnings later today.  Rate-sensitive stocks could be in focus today after SBI cut its lending rates for the first time in 
10 months.   Benchmark indexes Sensex and the Nifty ended modestly lower on Tuesday while the rupee closed at 
over two-week high of 64.75 per dollar.  Asian stocks are broadly higher this morning and Brent oil prices hovered 
near two-year highs while the dollar gained ground ahead of the FOMC decision later in the day and the all-
important October jobs report due on Friday.    The China Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI for October came in

Ryanair has warned of lower passenger growth next year and (EURO)100m in higher annual pilot costs after the 
rostering crisis that led to the cancellation of 20,000 flights, but has said the debacle will not undermine its profit 
forecast this year.
The Irish budget carrier yesterday cut traffic forecasts for the next fiscal year to March 2019 to 138m from 142m 
and said the grounding of 25 aircraft this autumn would see projected full-year traffic in the fiscal year to March 
2018 ease to 129m from 131m.
In highly anticipated first-half results after the rostering affair and cockpit crew defections left Ryanair short of pilots 
this autumn, the airline said pay increases to pilots would add (EURO)45m to crew costs in the current fiscal year 
and (EURO)100m in the following fiscal year.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said Ryanair "could have responded sooner to a tightening market" for 
experienced flight officers and had hired 900 pilots this year. But Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers 
said the cancellations debacle would have no impact on its profit projection this year as it continued to reap the 
benefits of higher ancillary revenues and a lower fuel bill.
Ryanair warns on growth and costs after crisis Airlines Pilot shortage that led to cancelled flights will not hit 
profits, says O'Leary
"We see no reason to alter our fullyear profit after-tax guidance which remains in a range of (EURO)1.4bn to 
(EURO)1.45bn," Mr O'Leary said. Ryanair has invested in new operations management and has added resources 
to its pilot recruitment, base manager and rostering teams, he added.
"The test of any management team is the speed and effectiveness with which they respond to a crisis, and the pilot 
rostering failure in early September was just such a crisis.
"We have responded quickly to repair this failure, eliminate further cancellations and we are determined to invest 
the time, money and manpower to ensure that it never recurs."
Post-tax profit in the six months to September rose 11 per cent to (EURO)1.29bn as revenue increased 7 per cent 
to (EURO)4.43bn. The airline makes most of its profit in the summer and the rostering crisis emerged only in mid-
September. Net profit margin was 29 per cent, 1 percentage point up on a year earlier.
Ryanair sparked a furore this autumn with the cancellation of 20,000 of its 800,000 flights between September and 
March. A scheduled shift from counting crew flying hours over a calendar year - instead of its April-March fiscal year 
- left it short of standby pilots.
After also losing pilots to rivals such as Norwegian, Ryanair intensified pilot recruitment and increased pay.
"We will now move from being 'competitive' to offering materially higher (over 20 per cent) pay with better career 
prospects, superior rosters and much better job security than Norwegian, among others, can offer," Mr O'Leary 
said.
Ryanair's pay offer has been met with a chilly response from some crew, with pilots at Stansted, its largest base, 
voting against the proposal.

Bums on seats. Not just in the cabin; on the flight deck, too. If Ryanair previously treated pilots as a pricey 
inconvenience, it is making up for it now, devoting a portion of its secondquarter statement to explaining how fair 
and generous their new remuneration arrangements are.
Yesterday, the Irish carrier published its first results since a crew-rostering debacle led to the cancellation of 
thousands of flights and caused punctuality to fall to just 70 per cent in the first half of its financial year.
The impact was readily apparent: one-off charges for extra payments to unhappy customers will tot up to 
(EURO)25m. Wage rises, if all bases agree to the terms, could be as high as (EURO)100m annually to redress 
Ryanair's thin pilot rosters. That presumes, of course, that all the pilot crews at its 86 airport bases throughout 
Europe sign up to the new pay packages. Ryanair negotiates with its teams locally, avoiding unionisation.
So far only 10 bases have agreed to contracts that potentially offer up to a fifth more than rivals such as Jet 2 and 
Norwegian Air. Pilots at Stansted, its biggest base, have not done so yet.
Ryanair says it has already begun hiring, lifting pilot numbers since the roster crisis broke. Certainly there should be 
more supply around after the demise of Monarch Airlines last month. It had 400 pilots under its wing, according to 
the British Airline Pilots' Association. Many of these were already being retrained by Monarch to fly Boeing 737s, 
which are the mainstay of the Ryanair fleet.
The pay boost, the recruitment drive and the reparations to some of the 700,000 unhappy customers who suffered 
flight cancellations in September, might cause Ryanair shareholders to sit back with a www.groan.No need. Barring 
a significant decline in revenues, these higher costs should be easily absorbed. Even in the unlikely scenario that 
Ryanair : pilot lite Twitter : @FTLex Email: lex@ft.com
Ryanair's air crew wage bill doubled, on Bernstein estimates, its unit costs would still be less than half of its 
European rivals. It pointedly did not change its full-year earnings outlook. Its shares, down as much as a fifth since 
peaking in mid-August, jumped 7 per cent.
Ryanair has spent the past two years softening its brash image by cuddling up to its customers.
Management will now have to blow some of those kisses towards crews instead. Luckily for investors, Ryanair can 
afford the extra love.

THE CHIEF executive of British Airways owner IAG said yesterday there could be more turbulence ahead for the 
aviation industry after the collapse of Monarch, and Air Berlin and Alitalia's troubles.
Walsh said there were "three, maybe four airlines" he thinks will struggle this winter.
"I think there are other airlines that are weak and may face challenges," Walsh said at the Airport Operators 
Association annual conference. "Fuel prices are edging up, it was over $60 this morning, the dollar is still strong 
relative to the euro, the pound," he said, pointing to "airlines that don't have much dollar revenue, and a lot of dollar 
expense".
"I don't think there's any on the brink of collapse at this stage, but I think there are some where if things were to go 
wrong this winter, there are certainly a few airlines out there that are very weak and wouldn't take much," he said.
When pressed for further detail, Walsh said "there is a handful" of airlines that "will face a challenge this winter", 
though he wouldn't be drawn on specific carriers.
"If Michael O'Leary was here, he'd give you a list of names," he added.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had said last month that Norwegian was "running out of cash", which the airline 
rebuffed, saying the comments had "no root in reality", and it has been profitable for the last 10 years.
Elsewhere, Flybe issued a profit warning earlier this month, following a rise in aircraft maintenance costs.
When asked whether IAG might be circling other airlines to beef up its numbers, Walsh said: "We're always 
looking," noting that the company had made a bid for Air Berlin's Niki.

But he added: "We're not targeting weak airlines to fix them."

RYANAIR yesterday announced a pay rise for its pilots following the airline's roster meltdown earlier this year.
For the six months ended 30 September, profit before tax grew 11 per cent, up from (EURO)1.17bn (£1.03bn) to 
(EURO)1.29bn it said in financial results.
Revenues for the first half were up seven per cent to (EURO)4.43bn.
Ryanair also increased its customer numbers from 64.8m to 72.1m.
Ryanair infuriated customers in September when it failed to roster its pilots correctly, leading it to cancel flights. The 
company explained today that it gave pilots too much holiday, and also failed to complete the training of new pilots 
on time, which led to staff shortages. Some 700,000 customers faced flight disruption.
Yesterday, Ryanair said its mistake "has challenged us to address the competitiveness of our pilot pay" and other 
staff management issues.
The airline said its pay was already competitive, but it intends to move from being "competitive" to offering 
"materially higher" (over 20 per cent) pay than Norwegian, among others, can offer.
Ryanair shares closed up 6.39 per cent at 1,682 cents per share.

again, as Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC) and Apple (AAPL) all add to recent gains as Internet heavyweights arrive in 
DC for a grilling on Capitol Hill.  
It's a sea of green in Europe, but on light volume with Germany closed for Reunification Day. Most exchanges are 
trading 20% light to trends. IBEX continues to ramp higher, up while the EuroStoxx50 is rallying as every group is 
higher except financials.  Airlines are flying this morning on RyanAir numbers. In London, BP (BP) is leading energy 
stocks higher, but across the continent BNP (BNP) is leading banks lower. 
In Asia, TOPIX lost as telecom came under pressure, Hang Seng was lower, the Shanghai was up small, the Kopsi 
jumped on Samsung and the Aussie was down. 
Powell positioning continues this morning as the US 10Y yield is basically flat, drifting under the 2.4% level as 
investors await the Fed tomorrow, Trump Thursday and the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The euro is lower on 
heavy data including better GDP and employment offset by weaker CPI. The dollar-yen had a nice bounce off 113 
as the BOJ stays on hold. Sterling remains in rally mode ahead of the BoE hike this week, while that Aussie dollar is 
hit again as political angst ramps.

Ryanair Reiterates Full Year Profit Forecast After Strong Growth in First Half Earnings
Ryanair Reiterates Full Year Profit Forecast After Strong Growth in First Half

 Irish low-cost airline Ryanair (RYAAY) reiterated its full-year profit guidance on Tuesday as it posted double-digit 
growth in earnings during its first half despite a spate of flight cancellations in its busy summer period. 
The Dublin-headquartered flight operator generated 4.43 billion euros ($5.16 billion) in revenue in the six months to 
September 30, up 7% from the corresponding period of the prior year, according to a statement published on its 
website. Basic earnings per share rose by 16% to 1.07 billion euros per share and profit after tax (PAT) jumped 
11% to 1.29 billion euros. 
The results come after a trying early part of September, when a rostering failure led to the cancellation of more than 
2,000 flights, which disrupted 700,000 customers. "A series of poor planning decisions created a perfect storm of 
one-off pilot shortages," Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said in the statement, describing over-
allocated calendar months of annual leave to over half of its pilots in September, October, November and 
December among primary contributing factors.
In response to the rostering failure, the airline said that it would offer "materially higher (over 20%) pay with better 
career prospects" and superior rosters to its pilots. If accepted by all of its pilot bases, the company said that this 
would add 45 million euros to Ryanair's fiscal year 2018 crew costs and up to 100 million euros in a full year. 
The company said that it had also added resources to its pilot recruitment, base manager and rostering teams so 
that it would be able to respond quickly to the needs of its pilots and cabin crew. 
"We see no reason to alter our full year PAT guidance which remains in a range of 1.40 billion-to-1.45 billion euros," 
O'Leary said, adding: "This guidance, as always, remains heavily dependent on close-in H2[second half] bookings, 
the absence of any further security events, ATC strikes or negative Brexit developments."

 Budget carrier Ryanair said pretax profit and operating revenue for the six months to September 30 both rose year-
on-year.
Pretax profit was up 10% to EUR1.45 billion from EUR1.31 billion a year earlier, on a total operating revenue which 
increase 7% to EUR4.23 billion against EUR4.12 billion a year before.
The Irish airline maintained its full-year profit after tax guidance, within a range of EUR1.40 billion to EUR1.45 
billion.
Ryanair highlighted concerns surrounding Brexit, saying it remains "concerned" at the "continuing uncertainty" 
surrounding the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in March 2019.
"There remains a worrying risk of a serious disruption to UK-EU flights in April 2019 unless a timely UK-EU bilateral 
is agreed in advance of September 2018," Ryanair said.
On Monday, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, 
said Brexit is unlikely to ground flights between the UK and EU. Walsh said that such a move would bring the entire 
continent to a standstill, the Press Association reported. 
Walsh told the UK Commons Transport Committee: "The prospect of there being no flying between the UK and and 
Europe, I don't agree with at all. I think this would bring the whole of Europe to a standstill." 
The comments came after Chancellor Philip Hammond had said it is "theoretically conceivable" that all flights 
between the EU and the UK could be suspended on the day Britain leaves the EU.
Walsh said clarity on how the post-Brexit situation would impact on airlines would be helpful, but IAG could deal 
with uncertainty. He told MPs: "It would be nice to have certainty as soon as possible. I don't believe it's essential to 
have that by summer of next year. I think it becomes more relevant if it's by the end of October.
"To be honest with you, I'm happy to operate in an area of uncertainty right up until the last minute."

Meanwhile, Ryanair also said Tuesday it stands to be the main beneficiary of the "inevitable contraction" in Alitalia's

 Stock prices in London are called to open lower on Tuesday as the pound maintained gains overnight from 
Monday's rebound, ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy decision on Thursday.
In early UK company news, London-listed budget carrier Ryanair said pretax profit and operating revenue for the six 
months to September 30 both rose year-on-year.
Pretax profit was up 10% to EUR1.45 billion from EUR1.31 billion a year earlier, on a total operating revenue which 
increase 7% to EUR4.23 billion against EUR4.12 billion a year before.
The Irish airline maintained its full-year profit after tax guidance, within a range of EUR1.40 billion to EUR1.45 
billion.
Ryanair highlighted concerns surrounding Brexit, saying it remains "concerned" at the "continuing uncertainty" 
surrounding the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in March 2019. 
"There remains a worrying risk of a serious disruption to UK-EU flights in April 2019 unless a timely UK-EU bilateral 
is agreed in advance of September 2018," Ryanair said.
Ryanair additionally said it stands to be the main beneficiary of the "inevitable contraction" in Alitalia's short-haul 
services, and reiterated its negative stance towards Lufthansa's purchase of some of insolvent airline Air Berlin's 
assets, some of which also were bought by UK rival easyJet.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 7.91 points lower at 7,479.90 on Tuesday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2%, or 17.22 points, at 7,487.81 on Monday.
"The pound had a decent day yesterday after the sharp falls seen at the end of last week, over doubts that the 
monetary policy might bottle this week's rate decision," says CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
The BoE will announce its latest monetary policy decision, alongside the release of the Monetary Policy Committee 
meeting minutes and Inflation Report, on Thursday at midday.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Lower Call; Ryanair First Half Profit Rises
"Markets still assign an 86% probability that the bank will raise rates for the first time in ten years this Thursday, 
which means the consequences of not doing so are likely to be brutal on the pound," Hewson notes.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3218 early Tuesday, firm against USD1.3198 at the London equities close 
Monday.
Meanwhile, survey data from GfK early Tuesday showed UK consumer confidence weakened in October on 
concerns about wider economic prospects, but willingness to buy improved for the third straight month.
The consumer sentiment index fell by one point to minus 10 in October.
The index measuring changes in personal finances during the last 12 months increased one point to zero. The 
forecast for personal finances over the next 12 months stayed at positive 4. The major purchase index gained two 
points to positive 3 in October. At the same time, the savings index held steady at positive 3.
"The latest Gfk consumer confidence did show a slight fall in October to minus 10 as consumers slowed their 
spending ahead of the Christmas period, though business confidence does appear to be holding steady for the time 
being," comments Hewson.
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending down 0.4%, the S&P 
500 down 0.3% and Nasdaq Composite closing slightly lower.
The US Federal Reserve commences its two-day meeting later today, announcing its monetary policy decision on 
Wednesday.
Overshadowing this meeting is the prospect of who will be at the helm of the US central bank next year. Current 
Chair Janet Yellen's term expires in February, 2018.
US President Donald Trump plans to announce his nominee as the next Federal Reserve Chair on Thursday, White 
House officials told the media on Monday.
Many media outlets have reported that Trump intends to nominate Fed Governor Jerome Powell to replace current 
Yellen. The nomination of Powell would purportedly provide continuity at the Fed, as he has previously supported 
Yellen's general direction in setting monetary policy.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed flat early Tuesday. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.1%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.2%.
The Bank of Japan kept its monetary stimulus unchanged as widely expected early Tuesday.
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his board members decided by an 8-1 majority vote to hold its target of raising the 
amount of outstanding JGB holdings at an annual pace of JPY80 trillion.
The bank will purchase government bonds so that the yield of 10-year JGBs will remain flat. The board also decided 
to maintain the minus 0.1% interest rate on current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the bank.
In China, data early Tuesday showed manufacturing sector growth softened more than expected in October largely 
due to weak new orders.
The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-expected to 51.6 in October from 52.4 in 
September, data published by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed.
This was the weakest reading in three months, having been expected to come in at 52.0. Nonetheless, a score 
above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
The non-manufacturing PMI dropped to 54.3 from 55.4 a month ago, which was the strongest since May 2014. A 
sub-index for the construction sector slid 2.6 points to 58.5 in October.

Yet to come in Tuesday's economic calendar, French third quarter GDP is at 0745 GMT, while eurozone GDP is at 
1000 GMT. In the US in the afternoon, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index is at 1300 GMT, and the Chicago 
PMI reading at 1530 GMT. The API weekly crude oil stock is at 2030 GMT.
Markets in Germany are closed on Tuesday for Reformation Day bank holiday.
Highlighting the UP corporate calendar on Tuesday are third-quarter results from oil major BP, a trading update 
from advertising giant WPP, and third-quarter results from engineer Weir Group and from online takeaway platform 
Just Eat.

Ryanair on Tuesday said it was on course to post record annual profits despite a rostering mess-up that forced it to 
cancel 20,000 flights and said it would have no problem hiring the pilots required to expand by 50 percent in the 
next six years.
Ryanair has seen over a billion euros knocked off its share price since it announced a first wave of cancellations on 
Sept. 15, an emergency measure to free up standby pilots to ensure the smooth operation of its fleet of 400 planes.
The cancellations sparked a wave of bad publicity and forced Ryanair to cut its annual growth plans for the first time 
in years to 129 million passengers from 131 million.
But management said it expected the cuts would lift average ticket prices above previous expectations and said the 
reduction will give it the opportunity to improve its operations.
"The failure has clearly shown that we have weaknesses within operations and we need to address those in the 
coming months," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation. "We don't believe there is any risk 
for the summer 2018 schedule."
Ryanair shares opened up 5 percent at 16.49 euros, still leaving it 8.5 percent below its value before it announced 
the first wave of flight cancellations last month.
In the wake of the cancellations, Ryanair has replaced its rostering team and hired back its former director of flight 
operations from Malaysia Airlines, Peter Bellew, as chief operations officer to spearhead an effort to better retain 
and attract pilots.
Ryanair on target for record profit
O'Leary said the airline was hiring around 40-50 pilots per week and said it was seeing a "flood of applications" 
from pilots in the wake of the bankruptcy of Britain's Monarch Airlines and Air Berlin.
He said Ryanair was beginning to see a reversal of outflow of pilots to Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Pay increases will cost the airline around 100 million euros per year if accepted by pilots in all of the company's 
bases, but this would not threaten the company's cost advantage over rivals, O'Leary said.
He admitted, however, that just over 10 of the company's 87 bases had approved a new pay deal. Pilots say a 
majority of the bases have rejected the deal, but Ryanair said only two bases - Madrid and London Stansted - had 
so far rejected it.
"We are engaged to see what their concerns are and the door remains open," Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan 
said.
But he warned the pilots may end up on lower pay rates than colleagues if they do not sign up. "We ... have 30 new 
recruits who have benefited from increased pay," at Stansted, he said.
Ryanair said it had cut fares by 5 percent in the six months to months to Sept. 30, the first half of its financial year, 
in line with its guidance six months ago due to growth in capacity in Europe's short-haul market.
But it said fares for the six months to March 31 would fall less than earlier forecast - by between 4 and 6 percent 
rather than the 5 to 7 percent guided in July.
This is in part due to the lower number of Ryanair tickets for sale and tightened capacity in the sector after Air Berlin 
and Monarch collapsed and Alitalia went into administration.
Ryanair said it was seeing opportunities to expand at provincial British airports and was in talks with a number of 
German airports following the collapse of the two airlines.
Ryanair said its profit after tax was 1.293 billion euros in the six months to Sept. 30, in line with an average forecast 
of 1.298 billion euros in a company-provided poll of analysts.
Ryanair reiterated its forecast that it would make a profit after tax of between 1.4 billion and 1.45 billion euros in its 
financial year, which ends on March 31, 2018.
The average forecast of more than 10 analysts polled by Ryanair ahead of the release was for a profit of 1.433 
billion euros, down from a forecast of 1.488 billion in a poll three months ago.
"Ryanair’s attractive long-term fundamentals, underpinned by its low cost base, remain intact," Liberum analyst 
Gerald Khoo said in a note. (Reuters)

Ryanair on Tuesday reported an 11-per-cent rise in half-yearly profit but said the cancellation of thousands of flights 
due to pilot rostering problems could cost the budget airline up to 100 million euros in this financial year.
The number of passengers also grew by 11 per cent year-on-year from April to September, but the grounding of 25 
planes after the pilot rostering chaos will slow growth in the next six months, the airline said.
It said half-yearly revenue rose by 7 per cent to 4.43 billion euros, while profit after tax reached 1.29 billion euros, 
up 11 per cent.
"These strong H1 results reinforce the robust nature of Ryanair's low-fare, pan-European growth model even during 
a period which suffered a material failure in our pilot rostering function in early September," said chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary said Ryanair expected growth in passenger traffic to slow to about 4 per cent in the next six months, with 
full-year traffic falling from 131 million to 129 million customers.
He said the airline remains "concerned at the continuing uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK's departure 
from the EU in March 2019."
"There remains a worrying risk of a serious disruption to UK-EU flights in April 2019 unless a timely UK-EU bilateral 
is agreed in advance of September 2018," O'Leary said.
"We, like other airlines, need clarity on this issue before we publish our summer 2019 schedules in mid-2018 and 
time is running short for the UK to develop a bilateral solution."

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - Upbeat earnings news helped European stocks inch higher on 
Tuesday, although overall gains remained muted ahead of key central bank policy decisions from the Federal 
Reserve and the Bank of England due this week.  The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.22 percent 
at 394.78 in late opening deals after rising 0.1 percent on Monday.   France's CAC 40 index was also moving up 0.2 
percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was rising 0.4 percent, while the German market was closed for a public holiday. 
  BP shares jumped 3.5 percent. The British oil giant reported a 9.2 percent increase in third-quarter earnings and 
announced it would launch a share buyback.  Budget airline Ryanair Holdings jumped 5.2 percent. The company 
maintained its full-year profit guidance after reporting an 11 percent increase in first-half profit.  Specialty chemicals 
firm Croda climbed 3.5 percent after a good performance across all three businesses in the third quarter.   
Packaging company DS Smith advanced 1.5 percent after it delivered first-half trading results in line with 
expectations.   Plane maker Airbus rallied 2.7 percent after reaffirming its 2017 guidance.  On the flip side, pumps 
specialist Weir Group fell more than 5 percent in London after a profit warning.  BNP Paribas tumbled 3 percent 
after the French lender posted lower trading revenues in the third quarter.   Pharmaceutical firm Eurofins lost nearly 
3 percent on equity dilution worries.  In economic releases, the French economy expanded 0.5 percent sequentially 
in the third quarter, in line with expectations, but slightly slower than the revised 0.6 percent expansion posted in the 
second quarter, official data showed.   A gauge of consumer spending increased in September after falling in the 
previous month, while consumer price inflation rose to 1.1 percent in October from 1 percent in September on 
higher food prices.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported Tuesday that its first-
half profit after tax rose 11 percent to 1.29 billion euros from 1.17 billion euros in the prior-year period. Earnings per 
share grew to 106.26 euro cents from 91.76 euro cents a year ago.  Total operating revenues - continuing 
operations for the half-year period grew 7 percent to 4.43 billion euros from 4.13 billion euros last year. 
 Traffic grew 11 percent to 72 million customers, thanks to a strong Easter and a 5 percent reduction in airfares, 
saving customers over 160 million euros in the half year. Unit costs, including fuel savings, fell 5 percent. Excluding 
fuel, unit costs were flat.  Customer spend rose 2 percent as more customers chose optional services such as 
reserved seats, priority boarding and car hire.  Ryanair said that following the rostering failure, its promise to offer 
pilots materially higher pay and better career prospects will add some 45 million euros to its fiscal 2018 crew costs, 
and up to 100 million euros in a full year, but will not significantly alter the substantial unit cost advantage it has over 
all other EU airline competitors.  Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, Ryanair reaffirmed its outlook for profit after tax in a 
range of 1.40 billion euros to 1.45 billion euros.  This guidance remains heavily dependent on close-in H2 bookings, 
the absence of any further security events, ATC strikes or negative Brexit developments.  However, the company 
noted that the grounding of 25 aircraft meant the company will slow H2 growth to about 4 percent. As a result, full 
year traffic will slow from 131 million to 129 million customers.   The company now expects fiscal 2018 fares will fall 
by -4 percent to -6 percent, which is slightly better than previous guidance of -5 percent to -7 percent.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - The majority of the European markets are set to end Tuesday's 
session with modest gains. Trading activity was on the light side, due to a public holiday in Germany. Investors also 
remain in a cautious mood ahead of tomorrow's policy decision by the Federal Reserve and Thursday's 
announcement from the Bank of England.   In addition to the central bank announcements, traders are also looking 
forward to a number of important corporate earnings report and economic reports, including the U.S. jobs report for 
October on Friday. 
 The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced about 0.40 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone 
bluechip stocks increased around 0.40 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. 
companies, added about 0.50 percent.  The DAX of Germany was closed for a holiday, but the CAC 40 of France 
rose about 0.25  percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. gained around 0.10 percent and the SMI of Switzerland 
finished higher by about 0.80 percent.  In Paris, Airbus rallied nearly 4 percent after reaffirming its 2017 guidance. 
BNP Paribas tumbled nearly 3 percent after the lender posted lower trading revenues in the third quarter.  In 
London, BP jumped nearly 2 percent. The oil giant reported a 9.2 percent increase in third-quarter earnings and 
announced it would launch a share buyback.  Budget airline Ryanair Holdings climbed almost 7 percent. The 
company maintained its full-year profit guidance after reporting an 11 percent increase in first-half profit.  Specialty 
chemicals firm Croda gained over 4 percent after a good performance across all three businesses in the third 
quarter.   Packaging company DS Smith advanced about 1 percent after it delivered first-half trading results in line 
with expectations.  WPP rose nearly 3 percent despite the advertising giant lowering its full-year earnings forecasts, 
saying firms are reducing advertising spend.  Pumps specialist Weir Group dropped nearly 7 percent after a profit 
warning.  The euro area economy expanded at a faster than expected pace in the third quarter and the 
unemployment rate fell to a more than eight-year low, while inflation slowed unexpectedly, official data revealed 
Tuesday.  Gross domestic product climbed 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, but the rate was slightly slower than the 
revised 0.7 percent expansion seen in the second quarter, preliminary flash estimate published by Eurostat 
showed.  Economists had forecast the sequential growth rate to ease to 0.5 percent from the second quarter's initial 
estimate of 0.6 percent.  Eurozone inflation eased unexpectedly in October, though marginally, flash data from 
Eurostat showed Tuesday. Inflation slowed to 1.4 percent in October from 1.5 percent in September. Economists 
European Markets Finished Mostly Higher In Cautious Trade
had expected the inflation to remain stable at 1.5 percent.  The euro area unemployment rate reached its lowest 
level since January 2009, data from Eurostat showed Tuesday. The jobless rate fell to 8.9 percent in September 
from 9 percent in August. This was the lowest since January 2009. The rate was forecast to remain at 9 percent.  
France's economy expanded as expected in the third quarter, first estimate from the statistical office Insee revealed 
Tuesday. Gross domestic product grew 0.5 percent sequentially, in line with expectations, but slightly slower than 
the revised 0.6 percent expansion posted in the second quarter.  France's inflation increased in October on higher 
food prices, provisional estimate from the statistical office Insee showed Tuesday. Consumer price inflation rose to 
1.1 percent in October from 1 percent in September. Inflation was forecast to remain unchanged at 1 percent. Final 
data is due on November 15.  France's consumer spending increased in September after falling in the previous 
month, figures from the statistical office INSEE showed Tuesday. Consumer spending rose 0.9 percent month-over-
month in September, reversing a 0.2 percent drop in August.  UK consumer confidence weakened in October on 
concerns about wider economic prospects but willingness to buy improved for the third straight month, survey data 
from GfK showed Tuesday. The consumer sentiment index fell by one point to -10 in October.  China's 
manufacturing sector growth softened more than expected in October largely due to weak new orders, official 
survey data showed Tuesday.   The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-expected to 51.6 in 
October from 52.4 in September, data published by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed. This was the 
weakest reading in three months. The expected score was 52.0.  Growth in Chicago-area business activity 
unexpectedly accelerated in the month of October, according to a report released by MNI Indicators on Tuesday.  
MNI Indicators said its Chicago business barometer rose to 66.2 in October from 65.2 in September, with a reading 
above 50 indicating growth. The increase surprised economists, who had expected the barometer to drop to 61.0.  
Consumer confidence in the U.S. saw a significant improvement in the month of October, the Conference Board 
revealed in a report released on Tuesday.  The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped to 
125.9 in October from an upwardly revised 120.6 in September. Economists had expected the index to inch up to 
121.0 from the 119.8 originally reported for the previous month.

Argentina's low-cost start-up Flybondi has unveiled its first Boeing 737-800, which is expected to arrive in the South 
American country in the second half of November.
The aircraft is being leased from SMBC Aviation Capital, and is configured with 189 seats in a single class. Flybondi 
says the aircraft is in Singapore and will soon depart for Argentina.
Flybondi
Registered LV-HKS, the 737 entered service in 2005 and was previously operated by Ryanair and Thailand's Nok 
Air, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.
The aircraft will undergo certification in Argentina, allowing the airline to launch operations by the end of the year, 
says Flybondi chief executive Julian Cook. Ticket sales have not started.
Flybondi plans to grow its fleet to 10 leased 737s, with eight based at the El Palomar military airbase in Buenos 
Aires and two at Cordoba. Cook told FlightGlobal in September that the airline has already leased another 737 from 
Avolon that will be delivered in the second quarter of 2018. While Flybondi had previously expressed interest in 
ordering the 737 Max 200 from Boeing, Cook has said the airline needs more time to negotiate a deal with the 
airframer and wants to first accumulate operational experience with the 737.
The carrier plans to operate to domestic destinations like Bariloche, Mendoza, Iguazu and Ushuaia among others. 
Cook has said that the airline plans to serve around 15 domestic points.

Ryanair has turned in a half-year net profit of 1.29 billion ($1.5 billion), up 11% on the previous interim figure, but is 
leaving its full-year forecast unchanged.
The airline achieved an 11% increase in passenger numbers in the six months to 30 September, partly the result of 
a strong Easter holiday period, but expects to cut growth in the second half to just 4% as a result of its cockpit crew 
scheduling crisis.
It is grounding 25 aircraft to help remedy the situation and has cut the number of passengers expected over the 
year, from 131 million to 129 million.
But it says fares will fall by 4-6% rather than the previous estimate of 5-7%.
Ryanair will incur some 70 million in additional costs arising from its scheduling issues, a mix of 25 million in 
compensation costs and 45 million in additional pilot costs.
Full-year unit costs, it predicts, will fall by around 2% – although the figure excluding fuel will rise by 3%.
Ryanair says it sees "no reason" to alter its net profit estimate of 1.4-1.45 billion.

BRITISH stocks were lifted higher on Friday, driven by a weakening pound and a rise in Royal Bank of Scotland, 
which helped outweigh falls among mining stocks and British Airways owner IAG.
The FTSE 100 closed up 0.3 per cent with sterling slipping to a three-week low against the dollar as doubts grew 
that a Bank of England rate rise expected next week would signal the start of a series of hikes.
RBS shares were up 1.7 per cent after the stateowned bank beat expectations with strong third-quarter profit and a 
more robust capital ratio.
British Airways owner IAG was the top faller, down 6.9 per cent, as strong earnings and revenue performance were 
overshadowed by passenger growth figures. Shares in rival budget airlines Easyjet and Wizz Air also fell 3.2 per 
cent and 2.8 per cent respectively.
Chinese cuts to steel capacity weighed on commodities prices, sending mining stocks Anglo American, 
Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Glencore down between 0.3 per cent and 3.1 per cent.
Mid-cap miners Evraz, Kaz Minerals and Ferrexpo also fell one per cent, 3.8 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively.
Among mid-caps Tullow Oil shares also dropped 2.4 per cent after the group said it plugged and abandoned its 
Araku-1 well in Suriname.
Several of the FTSE's large energy and mining firms will put results or trading updates out this week, especially on 
a bumper Thursday for company figures. Today, banking stalwart HSBC will put out quarterly figures while 
Glencore will release a trading update.

Is Ryanair ready for a successful turnaround?

Highlight: Ryanair may finally be forced to recognise a union if it is to move forward 
Body
Now that much of the public anger towards Ryanair over the mass cancellation of flights across September and 
October has cooled down, the company is focusing on the longer-term battle of dealing with the reason for the 
crisis: its deteriorating relations with pilots.
Ryanair has been extraordinarily generous with offers to cockpit staff since the crisis began. Offers of bonuses and 
pay rises running to five figures are not normally forthcoming from Michael O’Leary. It suggests that he has been 
spooked enough by the events to soften his language, especially in the wake of his remarks about how easy the 
role of a pilot is at times.
For pilots, this is probably a once in a lifetime chance to get him to do the one thing it has never conceded and that 
is to recognise a union. It is anathema to O’Leary to do this.
For years, Ryanair staff have organised themselves through employee representative councils located in each 
country where the company has a base. It has been the only concession towards unionisation it has ever granted.
O’Leary has been about the airline industry enough and has seen the damage from industrial action that has been 
done to BA, Air France and Lufthansa, and the effect it had on Aer Lingus’s costs over the years. As he said in 
September, hell will freeze over before he recognises a union at Ryanair.
Yet that is exactly the clash that the company is heading towards with its pilots. Staff at several of the major bases 
where the airline is under pressure to retain pilots have rejected the inducements offered to them so far. There is no 
doubt that the attempts to set up a Europe-wide employee representative committee is being pushed by a small 
number of staff, but it appears to be gaining traction as the weeks go by. The open rejection of the pay deals being 
put forward is pretty much unheard of at Ryanair.
Flight cancellations are a major issue for any airline. For Ryanair, they are even more critical. People fly with 
Ryanair (and more than 120 million did last year) because its selling point is getting customers from A to B very 
Is Ryanair ready for a successful turnaround?
cheaply. It may have recently attempted to rebrand itself with customer service frills, but if the airline can’t deliver on 
its basic promise, it has a real problem. Its pilots know that too.
This is the moment of greatest weakness for Michael O’Leary. Does he hold the line that he will not negotiate with a 
centralised body representing staff, aka a union? The airline has been quick to point out that there is no pilot 
staffing crisis. Several times over the last six weeks, the company has held ceremonies where new pilots are given 
their “wings”. The airline said it has hired more than 900 new pilots of all grades since the start of this year and 
recruitment is continuing.
Are the markets buying the idea that Ryanair, and Michael O’Leary, don’t have a pilot problem? The man himself 
will get a chance to explain on Tuesday at the publication of the company’s results for the six months to the end of 
September. This is the key time for any airline as it incorporates the summer travel period.
Since peaking at more than €19 a share in August, Ryanair shares are struggling to hold support above €15. That’s 
even after the company maintained its profits target this year will not be affected by the cancellations. The reaction 
of the share price would suggest that some aren’t buying the line that this is a temporary issue.
Investors really only care about employer-employee relations to the extent that it hits them. With a cold-hearted 
assessment, they are looking at how much money it will cost Ryanair to fix this and if that will be an ongoing hit to 
its cost base and profitability. If the airline has to pay one-off bonuses, that is fine. If it has to boost salaries, that is 
probably fine. But if this is part of a major shift whereby costs go up but there is not productivity in return, then it has 
a much bigger impact.
Perhaps the rehiring of Peter Bellew, a former Ryanair executive who departed to Malaysia Airlines a couple of 
years ago, will see relations between staff and the company cool down. He is widely recognised as a good 
operator, and the fact that Ryanair has gone out of its way to get him back to specifically handle this issue is a sign 
that tensions need to ease.
It would be quite an incredible sight to see Ryanair pilots across Europe actually go on strike or hold some form of 
industrial action and in reality, it’s unlikely to happen. That does not mean it is not going to be costly for the 
company to put an end to the threat of a strike.

Ryanair's razor-sharp focus on costs over the past 30 years has helped make the low-cost airline one of Europe's 
most profitable carriers.
But recent high-profile staffing problems risk undermining the airline's lean business model, pointing to a longerterm 
impact on labour costs. Some analysts have already started downgrading their profit expectations for the company 
over the next few years, ahead of Ryanair's first-half results on Tuesday.
"As it stands today, there is still quite a lot of belief among investors that they will get through it and they [Ryanair] 
will be looking to secure that view. Whether they can, and whether they have to take a profit warning along the way, 
will be interesting," says Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC.
In September, Ryanair announced it was cancelling more than 20,000 flights because of a shortage of cockpit crew 
caused by mess-up with rotas. As a result, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers has slowed its growth 
plans for winter and next summer. It has also gone on a pilot hiring spree and increased pay for existing and new 
cockpit crew.
Pilot relations in spotlight ahead of Ryanair results Airlines. Flight control ; Investors will seek assurance but 
Irish group still has highest operating margi....
But this pay offer has been coldly received by some, with pilots at Stansted, Ryanair's largest base, voting against 
the pay rise last week.
"The spotlight is on its pilot relations now and pilots suddenly see it as their moment," says aviation consultant John 
Strickland. "It's an evolving situation and it's hard to say how it will play out."
Aviation analysts say investors will be looking for answers on Tuesday, seeking assurances on how the company 
will overcome labour issues and whether it will impact the full-year profit outlook.
"Historically when Ryanair have faced challenges they've worked through them," says Mr Lobbenberg. "They've 
faced unionisation drives in the past and they have, generally speaking, breezed through them." However, it "feels 
different this time", he says. Last month, Ryanair was also dealt a blow in its legal battle to force employees across 
Europe to take dis-putes to the Irish courts, after the European Court of Justice ruled that cabin crew based in other 
countries could pursue claims locally. Some analysts believe this raises questions about Ryanair's employment 
model and could lead to higher labour costs.
"It's the coincidence in the timing of a tight pilot market, the coincidence of coming after the [EU] ruling and a 
broader social climate: a scrutiny on the gig economy and the tax affairs of large corporates. It challenges their 
business model and they are fighting to defend it," says Mr Lobbenberg.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, says he feels there is a question about how well Ryanair's management is 
"reading the mood among pilots".
Many Ryanair pilots have joined trade unions in recent weeks, as well as forming an unofficial European Employee 
Representative Council to express their views collectively to management.
Ryanair currently only negotiates with Employee Representative Councils from individual bases, and does not 
recognise trade unions. It argues its pay offer means pilots will be on better salaries and conditions than rivals, such 
as Jet 2 and Norwegian.
Jonathan Wober at CAPA Centre for Aviation, says all eyes will be on the fullyear profit outlook, currently forecast 
at between (EURO)1.4bn and (EURO)1.45bn.
Ryanair has previously estimated a (EURO)50m cost relating to the flight cancellations. But Daniel Roeska, analyst 
at Bernstein, believes there may be added cost for Ryanair to provide alternative transport for customers whose 
flights have been cancelled more than two weeks in advance, which he estimates could be in the mid two-digit 
range.
Analysts at Goodbody, meanwhile, say that pay rises and bonuses for pilots and cabin crew are expected to cost 
(EURO)70-(EURO)100m over the next year, depending on the outcome of Ryanair's pay negotiations with 
individual bases.
Analysts say Ryanair's second-quarter results should be good as the cancellations happened from the last two 
weeks of September and the cuts made at the time were relatively modest.
For now, it seems Ryanair's investors largely remain sanguine. One top 20 investor told the FT he "remained highly 
convinced of the business model", adding that Ryanair management have "earned trust from a shareholder 
perspective that they can handle issues".

IAG expects profit surge after rivals collapse Airlines ; Owner of BA also benefits from improving ticket prices

IAG expects profit surge after rivals collapse; Airlines ; Owner of BA also

British Airways owner International Airlines Group is expecting full-year profits to jump almost a fifth this year as it 
benefits from improving ticket prices, cheaper fuel and the collapse of rivals.
IAG, which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, gave a confident outlook amid a turbulent period for European 
airlines. This month, UK airline Monarch became the third European carrier to enter administration, following Air 
Berlin and Alitalia this summer. Meanwhile, Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, has cancelled 
thousands of flights following a pilot rostering mess-up.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said that British Airways has seen a rise in bookings following Monarch's 
collapse, while Vueling, its Spanish lowcost carrier, was benefiting in Italy from Alitalia's troubles.
He added that it remained interested in Monarch's slots at Gatwick, and predicted further consolidation in the 
European industry "What we are seeing clearly is consolidation within the European industry, with a number of 
weak airlines going out of business and there is a lot of speculation to whether that may continue and I suspect it 
will through the fourth quarter."
IAG said operating profit in 2017 will be about (EURO)3bn before exceptional items, up 18 per cent from 
(EURO)2.5bn last year. The airline group had previously forecast a double-digit percentage full-year profit rise.
IAG expects profit surge after rivals collapse Airlines ; Owner of BA also benefits from improving ticket prices 
and cheaper fuel
IAG said that third-quarter operating profit before exceptional items jumped 21 per cent to (EURO)1.46bn, up from 
(EURO)1.21bn a year ago, beating a company-compiled analyst consensus of (EURO)1.4bn.
European carriers are starting to see fares improve following a period that saw low fuel prices encourage airlines to 
flood the market with capacity, leading to lower fares.
The summer marked a brighter period for IAG after a power outage that grounded hundreds of flights in May. IAG's 
share price has climbed more than 50 per cent so far this year, including almost 15 per cent over the past month, 
but fell more than 6 per cent yesterday after analysts pointed to weaker passenger unit revenues than rivals.
While the group said passenger unit revenues - a measure of fares - in constant currency rose 2.2 per cent in the 
third quarter, compared with a year ago, analysts noted that this was a slower performance than the previous 
quarter when they rose 4 per cent. Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, said that IAG's third-quarter passenger unit 
revenue performance was weaker than German rival Lufthansa, which this week reported a rise of 4.5 per cent for 
the quarter.
Another area of concern was weakness in IAG's North American unit revenue, one of IAG's most lucrative markets, 
which was down 3.1 per cent.
However, Mr Walsh dismissed concerns, noting that the weaker North American unit revenues was down to the 
growth of its two lower-cost airlines Aer Lingus and Level on the transatlantic route, which had a "dilutive effect".

Compass heads north on back of positive comments from RBC London

Compass was among yesterday's biggest gainers after RBC turned positive on the catering heavyweight.
Recent underperformance has left Compass at a material discount both to other defensive-growth stocks, which 
looks harsh, RBC said. Recent robust trading is expected to continue and the departure of Richard Cousins, 
Compass's long-serving chief executive, is unlikely to be disruptive to the business, RBC told clients.
"In a sector with little value at present (and a number of risky recovery plays), we believe Compass is a sensible 
place to be on a relative basis," it said. RBC put a £17.50 target on the stock, which rose 2.4 per cent to £16.38.
A quiet end to the week saw the FTSE 100 edge up 0.3 per cent or 18.53 points to 7,505.03.
But British Airways owner IAG lost 6.9 per cent to 623.5p on profit-taking after damping fourth-quarter optimism, 
which had contributed to a 15 per cent gain for the stock over the previous month. Among peers, easyJet fell 3.2 
per cent and Ryanair was off 1.2 per cent to (EURO)15.72.
Tate&Lyle rose 2.43 per cent higher to 653p, with Kepler Cheuvreux upgrading from "reduce" to "hold".
Margins in 2017 for Tate's Sucralose sweetener are a product of Chinese supply constraints so are likely to be 
unsustainable, Kepler argued. However, it saw Tate's 40 per cent discount to ingredients industry peers as fair.
Compass heads north on back of positive comments from RBC London
Car dealership Pendragon rose 3 per cent to 25.8p after Teleios Capital, the activist investor that last year forced 
changes at SodaStream, disclosed a 5.3 per cent stake. Pendragon this week warned on profits and launched a 
review aimed at putting software and technology at the centre of the business.
Tullow Oil faded 2.4 per cent to 178p on news that its Araku shallow-water oil prospect off the coast of Suriname 
had failed to find a reservoir.
Satellite operator Inmarsat fell 3.9 per cent to 589.5p, a five-year low, after data from sector peers Eutelsat and 
SES both disappointed. SES warned of a "moderate decline"for fixed data this year, having previously aimed for a 
return to growth, and cut margin guidance.
Inmarsat has third-quarter results due on November 9. Exane expected Inmarsat to report falling maritime and 
enterprise revenue, the latter down by 15 per cent year-on-year. "At 19.4 times 2018 [earnings], Inmarsat looks 
expensive at a time when it needs to transition from its incumbent position on narrow band networks to a more 
competitive broadband network marketplace," the broker said.
Aim-listed On-Line, which owns a small stake in a retail investment website, closed up 173.5 per cent at 45p a day 
after saying that it plans to add "Blockchain" to its name.

 Stocks started trading in positive territory on Friday, with Royal Bank of Scotland Group surging to the top of 
London's blue-chip index after the bank, majority-owned by the UK government, turned to profit in the first nine 
months of the year. 
RBS turned to a pretax profit of GBP2.82 billion in the first nine months of the year from the GBP19 million loss a 
year earlier, as net interest income rose to GBP6.77 billion from GBP6.50 billion, and total revenue rose to 
GBP10.07 billion from GBP9.37 billion. 
The improvement was driven by a positive third quarter, when profit more than trebled.
RBS said that it expects to deliver its annual goals in 2017, and remain profitable in 2018. 
RBS was up 2.4% in early trade Friday. Barclays, having disappointed the market on Thursday despite reporting a 
huge jump in quarterly profit, was rebounding on Friday morning in sympathy, up 0.7%, while Lloyds Banking Group 
was up 0.6%, having been the first to release results earlier in the week. 
The last of the big four UK-listed banks, HSBC Holdings, is due to report its results early next Monday. 
The FTSE 100 index was up 0.2% early Friday, or 16.4 points higher at 7,503.72. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index 
was down 0.1%, or 20.05 points at 20,142.87, and the AIM All-Share index was up 0.2%, or 1.95 points at 1,028.65.
The BATS UK 100 index was up 0.3% at 12,755.17. The BATS 250 was down 0.1% at 18,375.00, while the BATS 
Small Companies was trading slightly higher at 12,490.28.
Compass Group was gaining ground, up 1.4%, after RBC Capital raised the services firm to Outperform while 
bumping up its price target. 
At the bottom of the blue chip index was International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 3.4%, despite forecasting 
an 18% jump in annual adjusted operating profit in 2017 to EUR3.00 billion from EUR2.54 billion in 2016. 
LONDON MARKET OPEN: RBS Rises On Return To Profit, IAG Sinks Airlines
Although its financial performance is on track, the British Airways, Vueling, Iberia and Aer Lingus owner also said 
passenger revenue per available seat kilometres fell 1.4%, countered by a 1.9% drop in non-fuel costs per seat. 
IAG's peers were being dragged down as well, with easyJet down 2.1%, while midcap Wizz Air Holdings was down 
1.5%. Ryanair Holdings was faring better, down just 0.4%.
Miners were the other major drag on the FTSE 100, with Anglo American down 2.4%, Antofagasta down 2.4%, Rio 
Tinto down 2.0%, BHP down 1.9% and Glencore trading 1.8% lower. 
In the FTSE 250, Elementis sat atop the index, up 3.7%, after it said trends seen in the first half continued into the 
third quarter, leaving it on course to grow operating profit across all three segments in 2017, despite experiencing 
some raw material cost inflation. 
Meanwhile, Tullow Oil sank to the bottom of the midcap index, down 4.0%, after its Araku-1 exploration well 
offshore Suriname came up dry as it failed to make a commercial discovery. However, some gas condensate was 
found in the well. 
Pharma giant Shire is still to release third-quarter results later on Friday, at around midday. 
In European equities, the CAC 40 index in Paris was up 0.5% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.7% early 
Friday. 
Europe remained centre stage early Friday following the European Central Bank's announcement on Thursday, 
when President Mario Draghi said the bank will drag out its  tapering of asset purchases, kicking expectations of 
any interest rate hike well into the future, possibly even beyond Draghi's scheduled departure at the end of October 
2019.
Early Friday, data from Destatis showed Germany's import price inflation rose to a four-month high in September, 
climbing 3% year-on-year and beating expectations for a 2.6% rise. This was faster than the 2.1% increase in 
August and represented the fastest pace of growth since May, when prices edged 4.1% higher. 
French consumer confidence weakened unexpectedly in October, survey data from the statistical office Insee 
showed. The consumer sentiment index fell to 100 in October from 101 in September.
This was the fourth consecutive decline and a similar lower score was last posted in April. The score was forecast 
to remain unchanged at 100 in October.
The euro was quoted at USD1.1624 early Friday, soft from USD1.1697 at the European equities close on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, the pound was at USD1.3098 in early trade, down sharply from USD1.3174  at the close on Thursday. 
The remaining economic news on Friday is US-focused, with GDP at 1330 BST, the Michigan consumer sentiment 
index at 1500 BST, and the Baker Hughes US oil rig count at 1800 BST. 
"We forecast that third quarter real GDP advanced at a robust 2.3% quarter-on-quarter annualized rate compared 
to the prior expectation of 1.5% quarter-on-quarter, as the net hurricane impact has turned out to be more muted 
than expected, with some affected sectors already rebounding in September," said Berenberg economist Mickey 
Levy. 
"Given the early rebound in September, fourth quarter GDP will show a smaller bounce back than previously 
expected. We now expect fourth quarter real GDP to increase by 2.8%, compared to 3.4% before. Second half 
2017 GDP is estimated to advance by 2.6%, and full-year real GDP is expected to increase by 2.2%," he added.

China's industrial profit growth accelerated further in September, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics 
showed. Industrial profits surged 28% year-over-year in September, faster than the 24% spike in August. Moreover, 
the latest rate of growth was the quickest since 2011.
Overall consumer prices in Japan climbed 0.7% on year in September, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
Communications said. That was in line with expectations and unchanged from the August reading. Core inflation 
also advanced an annual 0.7% - again matching forecasts and steady from the previous month.

British union sounds out Ryanair pilots over industrial action
British union sounds out Ryanair pilots over industrial action

A British union is asking Ryanair pilots pushing for better working conditions at the Irish budget airline whether they 
would be willing to take industrial action.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers has cancelled around 20,000 flights, citing a shortage of standby 
pilots to ensure the smooth operation of its fleet of 400 planes.
The crunch has prompted Ryanair to curb its growth plans for next summer and launch a drive to hire hundreds of 
new pilots and convince those who remain not to leave.
But its retention efforts, including the offer of large pay rises with conditions attached, have so far not been well 
received by many pilots, who want better working conditions.
A majority of pilots at Stansted, Ryanair's largest base, last week rejected an offer of higher pay. 
Many Ryanair pilots are employed via third-party agencies, though the airline says a majority are direct employees.
The BALPA union said in a statement on Thursday it was asking pilots whether they would support a group legal 
action to establish employee or worker rights.
"The desire amongst pilots to change Ryanair for the better is real," BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said.
"They tell us they are fed up with the way they are treated and that's why they are saying no to big pay rises that 
have been offered by Ryanair management," he said.
British union sounds out Ryanair pilots over industrial action
Ryanair, which does not recognise unions, has so far resisted moves by pilots to get the company to take a new 
approach to industrial relations, saying it already has structures in place for them to negotiate with management.
Ryanair rejected BALPA's complaints about Ryanair's working conditions as having "no validity." In a statement it 
said it was offering pilots wages that are 20% higher than some rivals as well as "unmatched job security".
The issue has highlighted competition among carriers in Europe for staff, although the recent collapse of two 
airlines, Monarch and Air Berlin, has made experienced pilots available.
Norwegian Air Shuttle said on Thursday it expected pay levels to rise for pilots as it seeks to compete with rivals for 
the additional air crew needed to expand its network.
Lufthansa is also looking for new pilots as it expands its Eurowings budget airline and has received applications 
from pilots not just at Air Berlin but at other airlines as well.
"It's probably a good position to be in right now as an employer in the German market when it comes to pilots," 
Lufthansa's chief executive, Carsten Spohr, said on Wednesday.
"I think the pilot shortage is happening on the lowest end of the pay scheme and those who don't treat their people 
fairly."
Analysts will be looking for more information from Ryanair when it reports results on Tuesday.
The Irish airline has persuaded Peter Bellew, the CEO of Malaysia Airlines, to return to his former employer to help 
deal with the staffing problems as chief operations officer, from Dec. 1.

Pilot union BALPA is conducting a survey to gauge the support of Ryanair's UK-based flightcrew for legal or strike 
action over working practices.
The union says the survey is a response to "growing dissatisfaction with the company".
One of the questions BALPA asks is whether pilots would be "prepared to support industrial action to achieve their 
objectives"; another, whether staff hired on agency contracts would support "a group legal action to establish 
employee or worker rights".
BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton argues that Ryanair is "unique in the complexity of its employment 
structures", and says the survey is partly aimed at finding out whether pilots want the union to "test the legality" of 
the airline's practice of using third-party contractors to hire flightcrew.
"We will be guided by the Ryanair pilots in all of this work," he adds.
Ryanair does not recognise union representation in its dealings with pilots, preferring to negotiate with them through 
employee representative committees (ERCs) at each of its bases. The airline regularly uses recruitment agencies 
such as Crewlink to hire pilots.
Responding to BALPA's statement, Ryanair says a majority of its pilots are direct employees, adding: "A minority 
are contractors, just like the contractor pilots which predominate among Norwegian, Wizz, EasyJet and other low-
cost airlines in Europe, and the many contractors employed by hospitals, hotels, airports and media companies".
On this basis, the airline argues, "BALPA's claims about Ryanair's 'complex employment structures' are false".

Ryanair's UK pilots are being balloted on launching group legal action to challenge their agency employment status, 
in what could be a further blow to the low-cost airline's battle to overcome its escalating pilot problems.
Balpa, the British association for pilots, is consulting Ryanair's UK-based pilots - many of whom are contractors - to 
see if there is support for a group legal action to establish employee or worker rights from either the employment 
agencies or Ryanair directly. If there is a strong vote in favour from pilots, Ryanair would become the latest 
company to come under scrutiny over its employment structure.
Last month, taxi group Addison Lee suffered a legal blow after a London tribunal ruled that drivers for the company 
were "workers" owed holiday pay and the minimum wage. The defeat followed a similar case last year against 
Uber, which the company is appealing.
It comes during a turbulent period for the Irish airline: pilot shortages led to the abrupt cancellation of thousands of 
flights last month and there have been reprimands from aviation regulators in several countries.
This month, Ryanair pilots at Stansted, the carrier's biggest base, rejected a higher pay offer, as they attempt to 
force the company to re-examine wider terms and conditions of employment.
Ryanair pilots balloted on legal action Airlines. Staff rights ; Balpa stages consultation on whether agency 
employment status should be challenged
Brian Strutton, Balpa general secretary, said: "In response to calls from our pilots, we are currently looking at 
Ryanair's contractor employment model and whether there's anything that can be done about it. We are looking at 
whether it can be challenged in a similar way that Uber drivers challenged their status."
He noted that Ryanair is "unique" in the complexity of its employment structures. "Many pilots who fly for Ryanair 
are not in fact employed by them but are agency workers, supplied through several different third, or even 
fourthparty companies," said Mr Strutton. As part of the consultation, which ends on November 6, the union is also 
asking whether pilots are prepared to support industrial action.
"The pilot workforce in Ryanair are in revolt. The company doesn't seem to know what to do about it. They've tried 
throwing money at it and that hasn't worked," Mr Strutton said.
Ryanair said more than 10 of its 87 bases had already accepted the offer. The airline currently negotiates only with 
employee representative councils, and does not recognise trade unions. Ryanair's contractor pilots must pay for 
their own hotels when they cannot return to their home base because of flight schedules. They are also not paid for 
time spent reviewing maps and routes ahead of a flight.
Several employment tribunal cases have arisen recently over "workers" claiming rights to the minimum wage and 
holiday pay. As well as Uber and Addison Lee, City- Sprint lost a test case brought by a bicycle courier.
Liana Wood at Leigh Day, the law firm that represented claimants in the Addison Lee and the initial Uber case, said 
Ryanair's employment structure looked complex given the use of agencies. "I've not seen a case being done like 
this, but it does raise a lot of interesting questions," she said.
Ryanair rejected Balpa's claims and insisted that a majority of its pilots were direct employees, although it refused 
to say how many. It also said that "in case of disruptions to schedules requiring crew to overnight in hotels, then this 
is paid by Ryanair". It added that if its pilots wanted to "discuss or improve their pay or conditions, they can do so at 
any time using the established collective bargaining ... process".

European pilots have launched a new crowdfunding campaign to provide financial security for leaders representing 
their community.The #PilotUnity campaign on GoFundMe is aimed at empowering and supporting pilots in their 
efforts to collectively negotiate.The initiative comes after the recent flight cancellation crisis in Europe, wherein 
Ryanair announced its decision last month to cancel 18,000 flights on 34 routes affecting 400,000 passengers."The 
need for this fund is a big warning sign that things are going seriously wrong in European aviation."Following the 
crisis, Ryanair pilots demanded improved employment terms amid labour disputes within the company.The fund 
administered by the European Cockpit Association (ECA) seeks to promote collective representation and unity 
among the pilot community, enabling pilot leaders to improved access to negotiations with airlines' 
management.ECA president captain Dirk Polloczek said: "We've got your back. This is all we want to say with this 
fund to the pilots who may be stifled by fear of reprisals and worry that their actions to organise the pilot community 
will get them fired."They need to know that the pilot community in Europe and beyond is united and determined to 
go in one direction. Through this crowdfund, the professional body of European pilots will provide the necessary 
support to allow the pilot leaders to focus on their core tasks of organising and negotiating."The pilot community 
wants to assert its right to freedom of association and organise collective negotiations, besides the right to elect 
representatives of their own choice.ECA secretary general Philip von SchÃ¶ppenthau said: "The need for this fund 
is a big warning sign that things are going seriously wrong in European aviation, because not every airline respects 
the principles of social dialogue.""Instead, they have their crews spread across Europe on a variety of atypical and 
precarious contracts, denying them effective access to genuine representation and genuine negotiations with 
management."

[Re: Britain must scale the EU cliffs to a freer, more prosperous future] Brian Monteith appears to have forgotten 
that the UK is a services based economy (close to 80 per cent of GDP comes from services). He claims that we 
need to bypass "the gold-plated tank traps of regulations on the shoreline and scale the EU's daunting sheer cliff 
tops of protectionism". By that does he mean he is prepared to see the UK accept Chinese standards for our 
children's toys? He goes on to say that "no business should face a cliff edge if they do their due diligence and look 
to establish fresh routes to markets old and new - and if that diligence has been ignored, is that business being best 
served by its managers?". Try telling that to the chief executives of BA, Easy Jet and Ryanair if we drop out of the 
Open Skies agreement. He also forgets that there is only one country which trades wholly under WTO rules: 
Mauritania, a country where 42 per cent of the population is estimated to live in poverty. Hardly a ringing 
endorsement one might suggest for a no-deal scenario? Chris Key

BELEAGUERED budget airline Ryanair is delaying planned changes to its cabin bag policy, which will now come 
into effect early next year.
In September, the Irish firm announced it would be scrapping its two carry-on bag policy and reducing fees for hold 
luggage, because constant flouting of cabin bag rules is causing delays on busy flights. The new regime was set to 
take effect from 1 November.
However, yesterday the carrier said the new policy will be delayed until 15 January 2018 "to allow customers more 
time to adjust to the changes, particularly during the busy Christmas period".
"From January, we will be restricting non-priority customers to one small carry-on bag (their wheelie bag will be 
placed in the hold, free of charge at the boarding gate) which will speed up the boarding of flights and eliminate 
flight delays," said Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs.

Ryanair will delay plans forcing non-priority customers to place any second larger carry-on bags in the hold to allow 
passengers "more time to familiarise themselves with the changes," it said on Tuesday.
The Irish airline, which sparked outrage in recent weeks by cancelling 20,000 flights, was due to introduce the 
changes aimed at speeding up boarding and eliminating delays from next week but will instead implement them 
from Jan. 15.
Ryanair cut its checked bag fees to 25 euros from 35 euros - at a cost of 50 million euros per year - and increased 
checked bag allowance to 20kg from 15kg when it announced the changes in September in a bid to reduce the 
volume of carry-on bags.
It said at the time that too many customers were availing of changes introduced in 2014 - when the airline moved to 
rid itself of a reputation for poor service - which permitted two carry-on bags free of charge.
Priority customers who pay an additional five to six euros per flight will still be able to bring two carry-on bags on 
board from January.
More than 700,000 passengers due to fly between September and March were hit by the wave of Ryanair flight 
cancellations after it said it did not have enough standby pilots to operate its schedule without significant delays.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, which reports its second-quarter financial results next week, said in 
late September that average fares were expected to be slightly lower over the following two months as it promoted 
seat sales.

It responded by promising pilots significant improvements in pay and conditions, exceeding rates paid by rivals, with 
negotiations to take place with each of its 86 bases individually.
Pilots at London's Stansted Airport rejected the Ryanair offer by a margin of 60% to 40% at Friday evening's vote, 
the Irish airline said.
"Ryanair will continue to engage with the London Stansted ERC (Employee Relations Council) to understand how it 
can address their remaining concerns, especially as it will be recruiting new pilots in Stansted from November at 
these higher pay rates," it said in a statement.
Two Ryanair pilots with knowledge of the vote told Reuters that the turnout was above 90%.
The deal included a pay increase for all grades of pilots of about 20% and improvements in conditions, two 
separate sources told Reuters.
Ryanair said in its statement that it would lift captain salaries to 20% more than those offered by rival Norwegian Air 
Shuttle.
Pilots at Ryanair 's largest base reject pay offer
A significant portion of the increase is by way of a "productivity bonus" of between 500 euros and 1,000 euros a 
month on condition that pilots make themselves available to work three extra days in November and three in 
December, according to a copy of the letter to pilots that was seen by Reuters.
The bonus also requires pilots to deal directly with the company through the ERC at Stansted.Ryanair does not 
recognise unions and instead agrees conditions with pilots through ERCs.
A number of pilots who have been organising on social media in recent weeks to use the pilot shortage to press for 
better conditions have demanded a new independent and pan-European representative body.
Ryanair has rejected criticism of its ERC system. A 2007 Irish Supreme Court ruling rejected arguments by pilots 
that the ERC system did not constitute genuine collective bargaining.
Organisers pushing for pan-European unionisation have told pilots that more than 30 bases have rejected the deal 
so far, a number of pilots have told Reuters.
A Ryanair spokesman said that figures was untrue and that more than 10 other bases had agreed new pay deals, 
with the majority of bases yet to vote. He would not provide a breakdown of how many had accepted or rejected 
deals so far.
"Based on what we have been hearing from Ryanair pilots, this is not a surprise," said British Airline Pilots' 
Association General Secretary Brian Strutton.
"Stansted is the critical base for Ryanair and I think other bases will now also reject." (Reuters)

Ryanair has postponed until mid-January the introduction of stricter rules regarding carry-on bags, which it argues 
are necessary to speed up boarding and reduce flight delays.
The budget carrier announced in September that it was adjusting its policy, stating that the changes would take 
effect from 1 November.
However, the measure will now be enforced only from 15 January, "to allow customers more time to adjust to the 
changes, particularly during the busy Christmas period", says the airline.
Passengers are currently allowed to bring one larger case and one smaller bag into the cabin of Ryanair flights. 
After the change, customers travelling on "non-priority" tickets will be allowed just a small bag as hand luggage. The 
second, larger case will be placed in the hold at no charge to the passenger.
Only passengers with priority boarding tickets will be allowed a wheeled item of luggage in the cabin in addition to 
the smaller bag.
The delay to introduction of the new policy comes at a sensitive time for the airline, which received significant 
adverse publicity following the cancellation of thousands of flights over pilot-rostering issues.
"We will be restricting non-priority customers to one small carry-on bag... which will speed up the boarding of flights 
and eliminate flight delays," states Ryanair marketing chief Kenny Jacobs.
Ryanair has already cut its checked bag fees by 10 to 25 ($29.40), and increased its check-in bag allowance from 
15kg to 20kg, as part of the changes.
Ryanair delays introduction of stricter carry-on bag policy Ryanair has postponed until mid-January the 
introduction of stricter rules regarding carry-on bags, ....
The move to reduce cabin bag allowances is another example of Ryanair departing from what once seemed like an 
entrenched position regarding its strategy. In 2006, the Irish carrier launched an initiative aimed at encouraging 
passengers to travel without checked-in bags as it sought to reduce airport charges.
"Ryanair remains determined to encourage more and more passengers to travel with carry-on luggage only," the 
airline said at the time.

MPs WILL hold a one-off session next week to consider Brexit's impact on aviation, after the industry has called for 
certainty on flying rights when Britain leaves the European Union.
The Transport Select Committee has invited airline and airport representatives to the session, including Heathrow 
boss John Holland-Kaye, and British Airways owner IAG's chief executive Willie Walsh.
Chair of the Transport Select Committee, Lilian Greenwood MP, said transport secretary Chris Grayling "presented 
a confident view of the situation post-Brexit for UK aviation" when he appeared before the committee last week.
Greenwood said next week's session "will test whether this optimism is justified when we hear from the UK's 
leading airlines and airports with a view to getting their take on the current progress of negotiations and the 
potential implications from delays in securing a transitional deal for aviation".
The minister was grilled by the committee over the fate for UK aviation post-Brexit along with other matters such as 
the collapse of Monarch Airlines this month.
The UK will no longer be guaranteed automatic flying rights when it leaves the EU, unless a transitional deal is 
negotiated ahead of the deadline.
The topic of aviation was back in the spotlight after chancellor Philip Hammond said earlier this month that it was 
"theoretically conceivable that in a no deal scenario there will be no air traffic moving between the UK and the 
European Union" when Britain leaves the EU. "But I don't think anybody seriously believes that is where we will get 
to," he added.
MPs to examine impact of Brexit on UK aviation
Grayling echoed that opinion when speaking to the committee last week, telling them: "If you had senior airline 
bosses like Willie Walsh and Carolyn McCall in front of you, they would say to you that they are not concerned that 
they will not be able to carry on flying post-2019."
However Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary in August warned of a "real and distinct" threat that flights from the UK to 
the EU could be grounded from April 2019 if no deal prevails.

At Boeing’s Renton site in Washington, the company is running at a production rate of 47 737s per month from 
three assembly lines. This record pace could be increased further, to 52 or even 57 per month, to enable the 
company to keep pace with a massive order backlog.
With deliveries of the 737 Max series having commenced to Lion Air Group carrier Malindo Air in May 2017, the 
company is increasing its output of the type, in conjunction with its NG-series twinjets. Other early recipients have 
included Flydubai, Norwegian Air International and Southwest Airlines, and a combined 28 had been delivered by 
30 September.
Exclusively powered by CFM International Leap-1B engines, the Max is designed to deliver a 20% increase in 
efficiency over the NG model, which entered service in 1998. Other enhancements include new winglets and a 
redesigned landing gear.
The Max programme will deliver an eventually five-strong family – the 737-7, -8, -9, -10 and -8-200. With a 200-seat 
capacity, the -8-200 has so far attracted a combined 210 firm orders from low-cost carriers Ryanair and VietJet Air.
Boeing’s 3,860-unit backlog for 90 customers adds to more than 6,500 deliveries made since the 737-100 was first 
flown in April 1967.
This year saw the first flight of the 737-9, and the formal launch of the stretched 737-10. Boeing secured a 
significant number of orders for this model at June’s Paris air show, although a high proportion of these represented 
airlines switching variant from the smaller -8.
Early recipients of the 737 Max include Southwest Airlines

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) shares fell more than 2% intraday after a stand-off from mid-September escalated 
Friday after a flight crew at London Stansted airport declined an offer of increased pay, according to a report from 
Bloomberg.
This comes as the European Employee Representative Council demanded salaries be doubled and extended 
across the carrier's European operations, according to a document sent to pilots on Sunday and seen by 
Bloomberg News.
The council has pledged to organize industrial action if an agreement is not reached, the news report noted.

Highlight: Howard Millar is being sued by his former employer Stellwagen Group
Body
A former top ranking executive at Ryanair left commercial information on the airline on the systems of a company 
he suddenly resigned from, according to court documents.
Howard Millar is being sued by his former employer, aircraft leasing specialist Stellwagen Group, over the manner 
in which he and two other top executives left the company.
In an affidavit opened in court last week, Stellwagen chief executive Douglas L Brennan alleged that Millar initially 
refused to hand back mobile phones owned by the company, and when he did they had been wiped of all data via a 
“factory reset”.
Brennan’s affidavit states that “this careful approach to data is to be contrasted with the fact that [Millar] has allowed 
a considerable amount of commercial information relating to companies of which he is a director, including Ryanair, 
to remain on Stellwagen’s systems and he has also left hard-copy documentation in his former office”.
The circumstances surrounding Millar’s departure from Stellwagen, along with high ranking executives Edward 
Hansom and Edward Coughlan, form the centre of an ongoing legal battle between the company and the men.
The company alleges that the trio, while working for Stellwagen, engaged in “a blatant and concerted attempt . . . to 
divert business holding major commercial value from the Stellwagen Group while all the defendants remain in its 
employment”.
In the affidavit, Brennan alleges that they “have evidently been operating for several months in furtherance of their 
own personal gain and directly competitive ventures while drawing large executive salaries from the Stellwagen 
Group”.
“They have taken the ideas of the Stellwagen Group, presented them as their own and arranged to lease aircraft to 
capitalise their new business. I believe and am advised that the profits arising from such conduct are the rightful 
Former Ryanair executive left commercial data on servers, court hears

outright any wrongdoing”. The plaintiffs will enter responding affidavits next Tuesday.

Corporate person in the news Peter Bellew Incoming COO, Ryanair Just days before Malaysia Airlines' chief 
executive Peter Bellew announced he would be leaving to move back to his former employer, Ryanair, the Irishman 
donned his guitar and sang at an industry dinner in London.
The choice of one of his songs - "Don't look back in anger" by Oasis - now appears apt. While the 52-yearold 
Irishman's departure will leave the Asian carrier searching for its fourth chief executive in three years, as it looks to 
complete its turnround, Mr Bellew will not be looking back at his time there with much regret.
Previously dubbed the "toughest job in aviation", Mr Bellew's time at Malaysia did not disappoint.
Alongside his predecessor Christoph Mueller, the former Aer Lingus chief executive who headed Malaysia Airlines 
from 2015, the duo have been credited with helping turn round the state-owned carrier left reeling from the 
disappearance of MH370 over the southern Indian Ocean in March 2014, and the shooting down of MH17 over 
Ukraine four months later.
Mr Bellew's next role - fixing the pilot staffing problems at Ryanair, which have led to the cancellation of more than 
20,000 flights at the lowcost airline - is likely to be equally challenging.
Ryanair troubleshooter returns after aviation's 'toughest job' 'Love for country is pulling me back to Ireland ... 
They need my help'
He described the return to Ryanair - where he starts as chief operating officer on December 1 - as a "form of 
national service". "Love for country is pulling me back to Ireland ... They need my help and there is a big challenge," 
he wrote this week.
Before joining Malaysia, Mr Bellew worked in a variety of roles at Ryanair for almost a decade before ending his 
time there as director of flight operations in 2014.
Aviation commentators say he appears the right man for the enormous task at Europe's biggest airline by 
passenger numbers. Often found playing his guitar and singing at industry events, with Irish band U2 another 
favourite on his repertoire, he is described as friendly and "affable".
"He's the opposite in nature to Ryanair. Contrast the abrasion with the affability Peter has," says John Strickland, an 
aviation analyst. "I think he would take a far more conciliatory, pragmatic approach. There would be more of a 
feeling that pilots are being listened to."
Other aviation insiders agree. One industry executive, who has known Mr Bellew for two decades, says he is not a 
typical Ryanair director.
"It always struck me that ... other Ryanair executives after a while would morph into [chief executive] Michael 
O'Leary, the same mannerisms, facial expressions, the same voice. But Peter would be someone who is not the 
Ryanair type. His bedside manner is far removed from Michael O'Leary," he says.
Mr Bellew has been given the specific responsibility for pilot production, training and career development, to help 
ensure that Ryanair's rostering failure, which left it without enough crew to man all booked flights, is not repeated.
He will have to improve relations with pilots amid reports that many are leaving to join rivals, while those that remain 
are fighting for better working conditions and union recognition.
One Ryanair pilot has said he felt the hire of Mr Bellew was a "bad move", stating that the airline needed "change" 
rather than appointing a former employee.
But pilots may want to take heart from the Irishman's social media - his Instagram account is full of photos from the 
past two years showing him surrounded by Malaysia Airlines staff. Following the announcement of his departure, 
his account was also flooded with messages from staff, expressing their regret and wishing him well. Tanya Powley

Outgoing Malaysia Airlines chief executive Peter Bellew has released a statement to the media, explaining his 
unexpected departure from the airline to take up the role of chief operating officer at Ryanair.
"Love for my country is pulling me back to Ireland. I got a call from Ryanair late evening two weeks ago to be COO. 
It is Ireland's greatest company. They need my help and there is a big challenge," he says.
"It is a form of national service. When I was asked on 27 September would I go to Ryanair, I said no. But a week 
later the call came and in life we can really never say never."
Malaysia Airlines had described Bellew's resignation as "unexpected", following Ryanair's announcement on 17 
October of his appointment. The Kuala Lumpur-based carrier stated that Bellew has "expressed his commitment to 
Malaysia Airlines" during a press conference on 27 September.
Bellew was Ryanair's flight operations director before joining Malaysia Airlines two years ago, and subsequently 
promoted to CEO after Christoph Mueller's departure.
In his statement, Bellew also pointed out that "there has been no interference" from Khazanah Nasional, and that 
the state investment firm has been "incredibly supportive" during his tenure.
"I cannot thank them enough for accelerating our transformation," he says. "People always ask me how do I cope 
with government interference. There has been none for me. Zero interference."
Bellew adds that Malaysia Airlines is close to making a turnaround, with a need for "just another 4 to 5% in monthly 
revenue" before it returns to profits. He discloses that the airline's revenue increased by 7% in the second quarter of 
the current financial year.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia Airlines outgoing CEO Peter Bellew said Wednesday that he decided 
to return to Ryanair as a form of national service because the Irish budget airline needed his help.
He is the second CEO to quit the Malaysian flag carrier in less than two years.
Bellew, who was previously Ryanair's director of flight operations, joined Malaysia Airlines in 2015 as its chief 
operating officer under a major revamp to help the airline return to the black. He replaced Christoph Mueller as 
CEO in July 2016, after Mueller left abruptly citing personal reasons.
Ryanair announced Tuesday that Bellew would return Dec. 1 as its chief operations officer to tackle a pilot shortage 
that led to the cancellation of more than 20,000 flights over the winter season. Malaysia Airlines said in a statement 
that Bellew's departure was "unexpected" but stressed its turnaround plan remained on track.
Bellew said love for his country is pulling him back to Ireland.
"It is Ireland's greatest company. They need my help and there is a big challenge. It is a form of national service," 
he said in a statement.
Bellew said it has been a "tough job" to fix Malaysia Airlines but there has been no government interference in his 
work. He said success is now within grasp and that the government shouldn't change the Malaysia Airlines brand.
"Just another four-five percent in revenue monthly and it should move to profits. Not always easy to gain but in the 
second quarter, revenue increased seven percent. The product is improving visibly: new wide body planes, new 
lounges, new loyalty program, new website and better operations in Kuala Lumpur. Still some work needed on the 
food! Lots done, lots more to do," he said.
Malaysia Airlines was ailing from mismanagement that saddled it with at least $1.7 billion in losses since 2011. 
Then it suffered two flight disasters in 2014. Flight 370 vanished in March 2014 with 239 people on board and 
another flight carrying 298 people was shot down over Ukraine a few months later. The company was removed 
from Malaysia's stock exchange the same year, with the government pumping in 6 billion ringgit ($1.42 billion) 
under a radical restructuring.
Malaysia Airlines outgoing CEO says Ryanair needs his help
The airline aims to return to profitability by 2018 under a $1.42 billion restructuring in 2014 that included axing 6,000 
jobs and cutting all long-haul routes except to London.

Malaysia Airlines' outgoing Chief Executive Peter Bellew said on Wednesday his decision to leave the airline for 
Ryanair was due to a sense of responsibility to his native country.
His departure after just over a year in charge means Malaysia's national carrier must appoint a third chief executive 
in three years as it continues to recover from two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 disappeared in mysterious 
circumstances and flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.
Ryanair announced on Tuesday that Bellew, its former director of flight operations, would be rejoining the Irish 
airline as chief operating officer on Dec. 1 to help address a pilot-staffing issue that has led to the cancellation of 
around 20,000 flights.
Bellew, an Irish national, said his return to Ryanair was due to "love for country" and that he could not turn down a 
request to help the struggling airline.
"It is Ireland's greatest company. They need my help and there is a big challenge. It is a form of national service," 
he said in a statement released in his personal capacity and not on behalf of Malaysia Airlines.
Malaysia Airlines said Bellew's decision to leave for Ryanair was "unexpected", and that its board would meet to 
discuss the move.
Bellew was Malaysia Airlines' chief operating officer before taking over as chief executive in July last year, after his 
predecessor Christoph Mueller abruptly quit less than a year after being hired for a three-year mission to revive the 
firm.
Irishman says love for country behind move to Ryanair
Under Bellew's leadership, Malaysia Airlines has been restructuring its fleet, while its owner, the state investment 
fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, has said it plans to re-list the airline's shares on the stock exchange in 2019.
Bellew in his statement refuted reports in Malaysian media saying that political interference had played a role in his 
departure.
A report by the New Straits Times, citing unnamed sources, on Tuesday had said both Bellew and Mueller's 
departures were due to Khazanah's interference in the running of the state-controlled airline.
"Khazanah, in actual fact, was micro-managing Malaysia Airlines. There were cases where Khazanah bypassed the 
MAB board," a source was quoted by the paper as saying.
But Bellew said there was no interference. "They (Khazanah) have been incredibly supportive to me personally and 
corporately...there has been no interference".
Khazanah in a statement called the allegations "erroneous and misleading".
Malaysia Airlines was de-listed from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in 2014, and had removed around 6,000 
jobs - at least a third of its workforce - at the peak of the airline's crisis in 2015.
Under its restructuring programme, the company is in talks to buy several widebody aircraft and is targeting a return 
to profits next year.
Bellew said Malaysia Airlines needed just 4-5% increase in monthly revenue to return to profitability and urged the 
airline not to change its brand.
"Much work has been done globally through the media and travel agents to rebuild our heritage...That work must 
continue and will yield the 5 percent revenue growth," he said. (Reuters)

Ryanair has lured back Peter Bellew, chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, to help it fix the pilot staffing problems 
that caused the cancellation of more than 20,000 flights.
Mr Bellew will rejoin the Irish carrier as chief operations officer from December 1 after leaving it in 2014, when he 
held the role of director of flight operations. He has run Malaysia Airlines for just over a year.
His appointment comes less than two weeks after Michael Hickey, a 30-year Ryanair veteran who was close to 
chief executive Michael O'Leary, became the first executive head to roll.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passengers, said Mr Bellew would be responsible for pilot production, training 
and career development to help ensure the rota failure was not repeated.
In an update on Monday, the airline said that 697,000 passengers affected by both the first cancellations and a 
subsequent scaling back of winter flights had been recompensed or rerouted. The remainder - out of a total of 
715,000 - have yet to contact Ryanair, it said.
But the airline still faces the challenge of overcoming its pilot shortage. Ryanair is in the middle of a pilot recruiting 
spree and has promised to improve the pay and conditions of its cockpit crew in an attempt to improve pilot 
retention.
Head of Malaysia Airlines lured back to Ryanair Airlines ; Bellew to be operations chief with task of helping fix 
pilot staffing problems
However, the Irish carrier's offer faces a chilly response from some pilots. Many have joined European unions in 
recent weeks, as well as forming an independent European Employee Representative Council to represent their 
views collectively to management.
They are asking for better working conditions and for its EERC to be the recognised body for Ryanair pilots.
Ryanair only negotiates with Employee Representative Councils from individual bases, and does not recognise 
trade unions.
The independent EERC has warned pilots against accepting new pay deals being offered by Ryanair to individual 
bases over the coming weeks.
In a memo to pilots last week, Eddie Wilson, Ryanair's chief people officer, warned that they risk losing out on big 
pay rises next month if they are "misled by the false promises" of unions.
Ryanair's offer will lead to a pay rise of up to (EURO)22,000 for captains and up to (EURO)11,000 for first officers.
Mr O'Leary said: "Peter will lead a significant transformation in the way we reward and interact with our pilots, 
improve their working environment and career development over the coming years."

LONDON (AP) - The remnants of Hurricane Ophelia slammed into Ireland with wind gusts of up to 80 mph (130 
kph) on Monday, killing at least three people, grounding planes, shutting schools and causing widespread power 
outages.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar urged people to stay indoors until the storm passed. Tens of thousands of homes 
were without power and the military was placed on standby. Some hurricane-force gusts were reported 30 years to 
the day after a weather event dubbed the "Great Storm of 1987" battered southern England.
"It is a very dangerous storm," Varadkar said. "The last time there was a storm this severe, 11 lives were lost," he 
added, referring to Hurricane Debbie, which hit Ireland in 1961.
Although Ophelia has been downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, Ireland's National Emergency Coordination 
Group on Severe Weather warned that the storm is still "unprecedented, with serious life-threatening conditions."
Ireland's weather service, Met Eireann, described the storm as the most powerful on record to have ever been this 
far east in the Atlantic.
Forecasters warned of flying debris, such as tiles blown from roofs. Large waves around coastal districts tossed 
sand and rocks onto coastal roads, seafronts and properties.
Wind warnings were in place for Northern Ireland, parts of Wales and western parts of England. Planes were 
grounded at several locations in the British Isles.
Some 130 flights were cancelled at Dublin Airport, while flights were also grounded at Manchester Airport. Both 
Ryanair and Easy Jet cancelled flights at Belfast International Airport, with more cancellations expected. Several 
flights to British airports were also diverted because of unusual odors on board thought to be associated with the 
remnants of the storm.
Authorities warned anyone with travel plans to contact their airline.
Hurricane Ophelia's remnants batter UK, Ireland ; 3 dead
In parts of the United Kingdom and in France's Brittany region, the sky turned an eerie color as Ophelia's winds 
carried a mix of sand from the Sahara and particles from forest fires in Spain and Portugal. On social media, people 
posted pictures of London landmarks against yellow-orange skies.
A non-profit group that provides lifesaving services around the British Isles warned people to stay away from seas 
and beaches.
Matt Crofts, lifesaving manager for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, said coastal waters are "particularly 
dangerous and unpredictable, with large waves and swells being a major risk."
As tempting as it is to watch crashing surf, it isn't worth the risk of being struck by large waves that can easily knock 
weather watchers off their feet, Crofts said.
"The sea is far more powerful than you think and your chances of survival are slim if you are dragged into the 
swell," he said.
And there is more to come Tuesday. Flights and ferries were cancelled in parts of Scotland, and authorities warned 
of coastal flooding in the southwest. The government of Ireland said schools and colleges would remain closed, and 
Northern Ireland's Education Authority said the same.
As the storm moved toward Northern Ireland, workers sealed off the Peace Bridge in Londonderry with tape and 
sandbags, closing it as a precautionary measure.

Alitalia sale on hold amid woes at Europe rivals Airlines
Alitalia sale on hold amid woes at Europe rivals; Airlines

The sale of Alitalia, Italy's flag carrier, has been delayed until April, adding to uncertainty in Europe's airline industry 
following a string of woes at Ryanair, Air Berlin and Monarch Airlines.
Pushing back the sale to April may prevent it from flaring up as an issue in Italy's general election, which is likely to 
take place in March, according to Italian political analysts. In a statement, Italy's economic development ministry 
blamed the delay on "extraordinary events" changing the "strategic dynamics" in the sector, including the break-up 
of Air Berlin, the failure of Monarch and the "operational crisis" at Ryanair.
Alitalia, which is run by three government-appointed commissioners after collapsing into bankruptcy in May, 
yesterday received a bid from Lufthansa for its global network traffic and European domestic point-to-point 
business.
Germany's largest carrier, which on Friday spent (EURO)210m to purchase more than half of insolvent rival Air 
Berlin, confirmed it had submitted an offer letter "expressing its interest in establishing a 'new Alitalia'," saying it 
could help support long-term economic prospects.
EasyJet also said yesterday that it had expressed interest in some assets.
The Italian government had been hoping that Alitalia would not be broken up, so it was giving preference to bids for 
the entire company.
Alitalia sale on hold amid woes at Europe rivals Airlines
But while the original plan was for a decision to be made on the new owner in November, the deadline was moved 
after a cabinet meeting on Friday. The extra time means (EURO)300m more of taxpayer funds will be ploughed into 
the airline, on top of (EURO)600m designated to keep it afloat during the transition to a new owner. Ryanair had 
been a potential buyer of Alitalia's aviation unit, but dropped out of the bidding last month.
The government also extended its lifespan until next September.

Bellew had previously been Ryanair's flight operations director before joining the Malaysian flag-carrier two years 
ago, and subsequently being appointed to head the airline last year.
But Ryanair says he will rejoin the budget carrier from 1 December.
Bellew's recruitment follows the sudden departure of operations chief Michael Hickey in the wake of the enforced 
mass cancellation of Ryanair services over a pilot rostering issue.
Ryanair says Bellew will be tasked with ensuring that the "rostering failure" which emerged in September will "never

Several flights to British airports have been diverted because of unusual odors on board thought to be associated 
with the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia.
EasyJet says four of its Monday flights were affected by the unusual "atmospheric conditions," which resulted from 
the storm pulling in warm tropical air and dust from the Sahara. Officials say two of the planes were diverted and 
two requested expedited landings as a precaution.
British Airways says it had some similar reports of smells on board its planes but had operated its flights normally.
Officials at Liverpool John Lennon Airport say that the conditions are causing some flights to be redirected.

Ireland's government says schools and colleges will remain closed for a second day as a third death was attributed 
to the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia.
The storm, now categorized as a post-tropical cyclone, caused widespread at least two deaths, damage, disruption 
after it slammed into the republic on Monday.
Irish Education Minister Richard Bruton announced on Twitter that officials "decided that all schools will remain 
closed tomorrow."

 Storm Ophelia is to batter the UK and Ireland with gusts of up to 80mph, with the Met Office warning of potential 
"danger to life".
Fears about the impact of strong winds have seen troops placed on standby and many public services in Ireland 
closed with schools, government buildings and courts among the services affected.
Remnants of Ophelia - which was previously classified as a hurricane as it made its way across the Atlantic - will 
reach home shores on Monday, resulting in "exceptional" weather - exactly 30 years after the Great Storm of 1987 
killed 18 people.
Schools and colleges will also be closed in Northern Ireland, which is covered with an amber weather warning - 
meaning there is a "potential risk to life and property", issued when forecasters believe people need to be prepared 
to change their plans and protect themselves from the impacts of severe weather.
Forecasters are warning of flying debris, such as tiles blown from roofs, as well as large waves around coastal 
districts with beach material being thrown on to coastal roads, sea fronts and properties.
"This leads to the potential for injuries and danger to life," the Met Office said.
Very windy weather is expected across the entire region, while a yellow warning is in place for much of Wales, 
Scotland, north east England, north west England, south west England and the West Midlands.
In Ireland, Met Eireann has issued a "status red" weather alert for Galway, Mayo, Clare, Cork and Kerry, warning of 
severe winds and stormy conditions.
Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said that while storms with these wind speeds tend to happen at this time of year, 
the one on its way is "quite a substantial system", adding that he would describe it as "pretty exceptional".
Mr Miall said Ophelia will have gone through a transition on its way across the Atlantic but will still bring "hurricane-
force" winds.
Remnants Of Hurricane Ophelia Set To Batter UK And Ireland
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar tweeted: "Defence forces being deployed in Red weather alert areas and on standby for 
further action (on Monday).
"Please check in with older neighbours and those who need medical care."
Meanwhile, airports are advising passengers in Ireland to check the latest information, with a n umber of Aer Lingus 
flights cancelled due to severe weather and the prospect of further cancellations with other carriers.
Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport are advising passengers to check the latest flight information before travelling to 
the airport, while Cork Airport said cancellations are likely.
Ryanair Holdings PLC said: "We will inform customers in the event of any changes to our flight schedule and the 
latest flight information will be posted on the Ryanair.com website."
Bus Eireann said it will not run School Transport Scheme services on Monday in the counties of Waterford, 
Wexford, Limerick, Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway and Mayo.
Loganair in Scotland is offering free flight changes on routes that could be hit by the severe weather conditions.
The airline said at the moment it still intends operating a normal full schedule on Monday and Tuesday.
The UK Military of Defence has three battalions - 1,200 personnel in total - permanently on standby to assist with 
contingencies.
But an MOD spokesman said it has not yet received requests from any local authority for assistance.
Meanwhile, bookmaker Coral cut the odds on this month being the wettest October on record in the UK into evens 
(from 3-1) following a flurry of bets on Sunday morning.
The firm is offering 6-4 that the wind speed reaches as high as 100mph in mainland UK next week and 2-1 for there 
to be snowfall in October.

       By Alvise Armellini, dpa   ROME (dpa-AFX) - German airline Lufthansa presented an offer on Monday to buy 
part of the operations of beleaguered Italian counterpart Alitalia, which is going through bankruptcy procedures.   
'Lufthansa has opted not to make an offer for the complete airline, but has stated interest in only parts of the global 
network traffic and European and domestic point-to-point business,' a statement read.  The terms of the offer are 
confidential, but include 'a concept for a newly structured Alitalia with a focused business model ... which could 
develop long-term economic prospects,' Lufthansa added. 
  The statement came ahead of a 6 pm (1600 GMT) deadline for binding offers for Alitalia, and after Italian daily 
Corriere della Sera said Lufthansa's bid was worth around 500 million euros (590 million dollars).  The newspaper 
also said Lufthansa was looking at slashing Alitalia's workforce of 12,000 by half, and that the Italian government, 
which is expected to influence the sale to at least some extent, was unhappy at the extent of the proposed layoffs.  
Last week, Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr expressed an interest in a 'newly positioned Alitalia,' describing 
the company as not economically viable in its current state.  Spohr was speaking after Lufthansa took over 
insolvent German airline Air Berlin for 210 million euros, part of a 1.5-billion-euro investment to revive the company.   
Like Alitalia, Air Berlin used to be 49-per-cent owned by United Arab Emirates carrier Etihad, which has decided to 
stop investing in the two loss-making European airlines.   The former Italian flag carrier filed for insolvency in May 
and is being propped up by bridge loans from the national government. The company was given a further 300 
million euros on Friday.   On the same day, the Italian government extended the deadline for the sale of the 
company to April 30, to allow more time to find a suitable buyer.  Ryanair had also initially expressed an interest in 
purchasing a deeply restructured Alitalia, but pulled out of the bidding process in late September after it became 
embroiled in its own flight cancellations fiasco.   Copyright dpa

two loss-making European airlines.   Easyjet revealed little about its intentions for Alitalia.  'Consistent with Easyjet's 
existing strategy for Italy,' the company said it had expressed interest in a purchase, but cautioned that 'there is no 
certainty at this stage that any transaction will proceed.'  The former Italian flag carrier filed for insolvency in May 
and is being propped up by bridge loans from the national government. The company was given a further 300 
million euros on Friday.   On the same day, the Italian government extended the deadline for the sale of the 
company to April 30, to allow more time to find a suitable buyer.  Ryanair had also initially expressed an interest in 
purchasing a deeply restructured Alitalia, but pulled out of the bidding process in late September after it became 
embroiled in its own flight cancellations fiasco.   Copyright dpa

 Shares of Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) drifted marginally lower in post-market trading after it emerged the European 
budget carrier's efforts to calm disgruntled pilots were dealt a blow after crew at London Stansted Airport turned 
down a wage increase, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
At a Friday meeting, the majority of flight crew voted against a deal for annual raises of up to EUR22,000 ($26,005) 
for captains and EUR11,000 for first officers, the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are 
private, were cited as saying. 
A spokesman for Ryanair told the news agency it doesn't comment on "rumour or speculation".

MARK Carney will be forced to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation has soared past three per 
cent, if prices rise as expected in this week's official figures.
The Bank of England governor, who just a year ago was writing to Philip Hammond about the alarmingly low level 
of inflation, is set to respond to the spike in costs driven by upward pressure on imports from the weak pound.
Economists have pencilled in a jump from 2.9 per cent in August to 3.1 per cent in September, which if confirmed 
by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow will be the biggest squeeze on living costs for more than five years.
Inflation is likely to have received a push in the past month from utility price hikes, petrol costs and a possible spike 
in last-minute flights following Ryanair's cancellations. Since the Bank was granted the power to set interest rates in 
1997, it has been obliged to write to the chancellor if inflation strays more than one percentage point beyond its 
target of two per cent.
Some economists have said this recent bounce will be short, once the spike from import costs that followed the 
pound's slump drops out of the numbers.
"We believe that it is still likely that inflation will fall back markedly through 2018 as the impact of sterling's past drop 
fades and domestic price pressures are limited by lacklustre growth, with only a gradual pickup in earnings," said 
EY Item Club chief economic adviser Howard Archer.
The Item Club has called on the bank to hold rates until the economy gathers momentum. Growth rose to 0.3 per 
cent in the second quarter.
Carney gets ready to pen letter as inflation spikes
Carney has signalled that rates will rise "in the coming months", which has been interpreted as a hike in November. 
Raising rates would trim consumer spending power by raising the cost of borrowing, with possible implications for 
economic growth. "We've been willing to tolerate inflation being over target. We're in relatively rare company with 
having inflation over target," Carney said this weekend at the IMF summit.

 International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC is looking into buying up the London Gatwick slots of recently-
collapsed airline Monarch, IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh told Reuters on Friday, while also expressing concerns 
over Deutsche Lufthansa AG's Air Berlin PLC deal.
At the CAPA centre for aviation global summit, the IAG boss told Reuters: "With Monarch, I think everybody's 
interested in slots at Gatwick, and that would be principally our interest as well [...] If we can get more slots at 
Gatwick, we'll certainly be looking for more."
Luton-based Monarch entered into administration at 0400 BST on October 2, the biggest UK airline ever to cease 
trading.
In a separate Reuters article, the outlet reported Walsh expressed competition concerns following Lufthansa's 
purchase of multiple assets from Air Berlin. 
Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy on August 15 after its main shareholder, Etihad, said it would not give further financial 
support. The company continued its operations through a government loan.
Lufthansa agreed on Thursday to pay EUR210 million for 81 of Air Berlin's total of 140 aircraft and to hire 3,000 of 
its more than 8,000 employees. Air Berlin last year ran up a loss of about EUR782 million and has debts totalling 
nearly EUR1.2 billion.
"We did make a bid for Air Berlin, but our view was that Lufthansa was always going to get it," Walsh told Reuters at 
the CAPA summit in London.
"We will watch carefully because we think there are significant competition issues," he added.
BBC News on earlier on Friday reported budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is also set to challenge Lufthansa's 
Air Berlin deal.
PRESS: IAG Interested In Monarch Flight Slots, Has Air Berlin Concerns
The Irish low-cost airline had previously said Air Berlin's insolvency had been "set up" to allow Lufthansa to take 
over a "debt-free" Air Berlin, which would be in breach of German and EU competition rules.
Ryanair in August urged regulators to block the "stitch-up between the German government, Lufthansa and Air 
Berlin", which it defined as an "anti-consumer takeover".
Shares in IAG were down 0.5% at 623.50 pence on Friday, while Ryanair was down 0.4% at EUR16.84.

When steady firms hit turbulence

Highlight:  Ryanair and Greencore have sprung surprises on their shareholders recently that highlight operational, 
reputational and acquisition risks 
Body
Playing the equity markets is always hazardous. But when an unexpected problem occurs in a business that has 
had a flawless reputation through several economic cycles, the immediate impact on the share price can be wholly 
disproportionate to the scale of the problem that has emerged.
Over the past month, one of Ireland’s best-managed companies, Ryanair, has hit unexpected operational 
challenges. Over the past 12 months, Greencore has too. These challenges have taken their toll on both 
companies’ share prices.
How permanent is the damage? Could the setbacks repeat themselves? And have the resulting share price falls 
been disproportionate in the context of the resilience of the business models, track record, opportunity and 
management capabilities of the companies in question?
Do the falls present a buying opportunity?
The management in both companies is – if typified by their two chief executives – different in style, but not hugely 
different in terms of capability and focus on operational excellence, tight cost management, clear strategic direction 
and planning.
Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary is brash, a hard task master and relentless in pursuit of low costs to drive operating 
margins, cashflows and market share.
Greencore’s Patrick Coveney is intellectual, serious, smart without being brash and, from his McKinsey days, has 
had experience of navigating or at least advising on tough challenges across many different companies and 
industry sectors. Operational excellence is his forte and is one of the critical success factors for a company like 
Greencore selling into nearly all of Britain’s and some of the US’s most demanding food retailers.
When steady firms hit turbulence
Both companies have delivered outstanding returns for shareholders over the past five years. But events have now 
raised questions about the robustness of their business models and the risk management of their operations.
Let’s start with Ryanair. The company’s brand is strong, synonymous with low cost and – despite the recent events 
– at least as reliable as most of its higher cost competitors.
Management’s obsession with low costs across the business extends to the little things. Cost cultures – good ones 
and bad ones – can become embedded in an organisation’s DNA.
But any slippage in the penny-pinching approach has a tendency to gain traction. So at Ryanair no slippage is 
tolerated, either in the air or on the ground, in the office or in the bathroom. Spartan, from floor to ceiling. No 
freebies for anyone or anything (apart perhaps from a slither of soap and the cheapest loo paper). In head office, 
the cheapest biros are used and those coloured sticky notepad blocks are banned.
Lowest cost is what most (not all) of Ryanair’s customers want and only through parsimony in every corner of the 
organisation on the part of operational management can they deliver for customers and shareholders what they 
want.
For shareholders, the obsessive cost culture combined with the progressively clever segmentation of the customer 
base between low-frills passengers and no-frills passengers and between early-bookers and late-bookers has 
translated into operating margins for the company in the high teens – often touching 20 per cent – and well ahead 
of peers.
This way, the airline continues to sustain growth, expand routes and deliver highly competitive pricing. It has been 
an uninterrupted virtuous circle sustained over 40 years until the past fortnight.
The problem is that, taken too far, a petty (as opposed to tight) cost culture can have knock-on effects on staff 
morale and staff flexibility. And now that buoyant times for pilots have returned with competitors expanding their 
fleets, pilot loyalty to Ryanair is turning sour.
Hence, the calamity: with inadequate pilot resources to cover holiday periods and consequently insufficient margin 
of safety, the company has been forced to pare back flight schedules, cancel flights and dishonour bookings, 
angering tens of thousands of customers and undermining the perception of reliability.
But if you believe that the anger, inconvenience and dreadful public relations has done permanent damage to 
Ryanair as a corporate entity, think again.
The business model is as robust as it has ever been. Its balance sheet is strong and its operating margins, 
approaching 20 per cent, are second to none. It is that financial strength that will enable recent problems with 
staffing and the associated cancellation of flights to be resolved – but not without augmentation of its HR function 
and head office staff communications, and some tweaking of restricted benefits for staff to rebuild morale and 
goodwill, the absence of which is now a serious handicap.
With operating profit margins as high as 20 per cent and very low balance sheet gearing relative to peers, Ryanair 
can rebuild staff morale without undermining either the company’s operating model or its tight cost culture. That’s 
why the fall in the share price last week presents, in my view, a buying opportunity.
But Michael O’Leary needs to come to appreciate that a noose that is too tight angers and eventually breaks, by 
stirring collective staff resentment and retaliation. It is the “every little helps” – as the Tesco chief executive calls 
them for his shoppers – that make the difference. So stick with the cheap biros and notepads in head office, but let 
the Ryanair pilots and staff have a voucher per flight for an on-board sandwich and a bottle of water, instead of 
making them pay the on-board price. For three attendants and two pilots, the cost wouldn’t take one tenth of 1 per 
cent off a flight’s operating profit margin. What price a bit of goodwill?
When steady firms hit turbulence
As to the working conditions and remuneration of the pilots, Ryanair’s operating margins can also easily carry the 
bill for a more generous package, even if only by way of deferred but decent loyalty bonuses linked to longevity of 
service and overall company and share price performance.
The reduction in operational risk for shareholders and the savings in compensation for passengers that have been 
let down should more than compensate for the very minor dilution in earnings that the “every little helps” for 
stewards and pilots would involve.
Ryanair is a great business model which has delivered stellar returns for shareholders. But for staff, the company 
has stretched the elastic too far and management now need to show them and shareholders that they recognise the 
need for a more balanced approach without materially impairing the outstanding financial performance of the airline 
through good times and bad.
I am sticking with the shares because I know the board and the management are smart enough to learn the lessons 
of the past few weeks and sort the problems at marginal additional cost on an ongoing basis (excluding the short-
term compensation costs that will hit earnings over the next six months). I am also sticking with the shares because 
the scope for further profitable expansion – organically and by acquisition – is significant.
Greencore is a very different story and one which has had a hammered share price over the past nine months – 
ever since the announcement of the Peacock Foods acquisition which gave rise to a dilutive nine for 13 rights issue 
at £1.53 per share.
The company has been in the US for a decade now. But its operations there never turned a profit due to a lack of 
scale. Hence the recent $747.5 million acquisition of Peacock Foods from Tyson Foods, financed substantially by 
the rights issue.
Ever since that rights issue, the share price has been under pressure. Given the scale of the rights (nine shares for 
every 13 held), the share overhang has taken its toll. But the scale of the share-price fall cannot be put down 
entirely to mere technical issues.
[caption id="attachment_400303" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Patrick Coveney of Greencore Pic: Maura 
Hickey[/caption]
There appear to be at least two other issues niggling the market. One is the news of the phasing out of the 
Starbucks contract – heretofore Greencore’s biggest customer in the US. The second was the fact that another 
major customer in the US – Tyson Foods – has bought a potential competitor to Greencore, AdvancePierre, which 
might pose a threat to the continued relationship with Tyson. And last week what appears to have been a mild food 
health scare relating to potential listeria occasioned a Greencore-initiated product recall which rattled the shares 
again.
It has, however, emerged that the recall was merely a precautionary measure and no adverse findings have been 
made. But hedge funds and others, including Blackrock and Goldman Sachs, have been shorting Greencore’s 
shares, and look to have been doing well out of it.
The reality is that as a mid-cap Ftse 250 company, and one with a concentrated customer base, market rumours – 
be it about the threat of the loss of a big customer or about a suspected contaminated product recall which may 
merely be precautionary – can provide a feeding frenzy of gossip and an opportunity for short sellers to step in and 
out, thus making a killing by shorting while uncertainty prevails.
The fact is that the spread of a bad story, however motivated, can prompt significant adverse moves in the share 
price of a mid-cap company like Greencore and prove a bonanza for the shorters. For the avoidance of doubt, there 
is no suggestion that either Goldman Sachs or Blackrock have been involved in market abuse.
When steady firms hit turbulence
Personally, I remain a very happy holder of Ryanair shares. They have motored well since I bought them, but for 
the moment, I will remain a less than happy holder of Greencore, at least until more clarity is on offer, hopefully at 
the results announcement next month.
The wait is frustrating but nowhere near as frustrating as the constraints on Greencore management who during 
close periods can’t talk, and through all periods have a duty of confidentiality about major customer relationships, 
many of which can impact materially on group performance.
Rumours they would like to quell about prospective customer attrition or otherwise must be equally frustrating. But 
the signal given through material share price purchases by management over the past month provides some 
comfort.
So I am keeping the faith for the moment until the next set of results and outlook statement in November. As to 
Ryanair, I am tempted to top up.

Ryanair is piling pressure on pilots to accept its pay offer as the low-cost airline fights to overcome a crisis over the 
cancellation of more than 20,000 flights, triggered by a shortage of cockpit crew.
In a memo to pilots, Eddie Wilson, Ryanair chief people officer, warned that they risked losing out on big pay rises 
next month if they were "misled by the false promises" of unions.
It comes days after Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, wrote to pilots promising that the airline would exceed 
rivals' pay rates and improve job security.
However, the offer of the Irish carrier, Europe's largest by number of passengers, faces a chilly response from 
some pilots. Many have joined European trade unions in recent weeks, as well as forming an independent 
European Employee Representative Council to represent their views collectively to management. But Ryanair only 
negotiates with Employee Representative Councils from individual bases, and does not recognise trade unions.
The independent EERC has warned pilots against accepting new pay deals being offered by Ryanair to individual 
bases over the coming weeks.
In his memo to pilots, Mr Wilson reiterated that Ryanair would not meet any union group.
Ryanair presses pilots to accept offer to end crisis; Airlines ; Cockpit crew hold out for better working conditions 
and collective negotiations
"We will not enter into writing, or meetings, with competitor airline pilots/unions, or whatever they call themselves 
this week ... whose sole aim is to prevent you from accessing a big pay increase next month," he wrote.
"The only way to ensure that your base shares in this upside - from November - is to support your ERC's reaching 
agreement over the next three weeks.
"If this doesn't happen, then these pay increases may be delayed until December, or next year, or not delivered at 
all." Ryanair is working on containing the damage after it was forced to cancel 20,000 of its 800,000 flights between 
September and March. It cut the flights because of a regulatory change that required airlines to calculate crew flying 
hours over a calendar year, instead of its own fiscal year. That left it with too few standby pilots on its roster.
The first, abrupt cancellation of 2,000 flights late last month with little or no notice led to chaos for thousands of 
passengers who found themselves stranded far from home. Its second cancellation saw a further 18,000 flights 
grounded.
Ryanair pilots are asking for better working conditions and for the EERC to be their recognised representative body.
Ryanair's current offer will see a pay rise of up to (EURO)22,000 a year for captains and up to (EURO)11,000 for 
first officers depending on where they are based.

Lufthansa to buy more than half of Air Berlin Airlines

Lufthansa will buy more than half of Air Berlin, the lossmaking carrier that filed for insolvency in August after losing 
the support of Etihad, its biggest shareholder.
Air Berlin confirmed yesterday that Germany's largest carrier will buy Niki, its Austrian holiday airline; regional 
carrier LGW; and 20 other aircraft.
People close to Air Berlin said the transaction amounts to (EURO)210m. Lufthansa declined to confirm the number.
"Today we are taking a big step forward," said Thomas Winkelmann, chief executive at Air Berlin. "However, we 
cannot breathe again until the EU Commission finalises the transaction."
Negotiations with easyJet, which is in the running to buy between 20 to 30 of Air Berlin's aircraft, are ongoing. 
EasyJet declined to comment.
Ryanair, which has raised competition concerns in the event of Lufthansa taking the lion's share of Air Berlin's 
asset, said it would be referring the matter to the EU competition authority in due course.
The agreement, approved on Wednesday by Air Berlin's supervisory board, follows a tumultuous summer for the 
European airline industry.
Three carriers have entered insolvency in the space of six months, after intense competition in the European short-
haul market has put increasing pressure on weaker carriers.
Lufthansa to buy more than half of Air Berlin Airlines
Last week, the UK's Monarch became the latest airline to collapse. Meanwhile, binding bids for Italian carrier 
Alitalia, which entered administration in May after its employees rejected a restructuring plan, are due on Monday. 
Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August after Abu Dhabi-based Etihad decided not to pump in any more money after 
providing a series of cash injections over the past six years.
A (EURO)150m bridging loan offered by the government helped the carrier through the summer, avoiding the 
turmoil experienced by Monarch, which saw the UK launch Britain's "biggest ever peacetime repatriation" to fly 
home more than 100,000 holidaymakers.
Without the loan, Mr Winkelmann said last month, the fleet would have been grounded on the weekend of August 
12-13, meaning "the immediate loss of employment" for all staff.

[Re: Wizz Air and Ryanair are reporting soaring traffic] The news that Ryanair is the world's fifth biggest airline 
comes as little surprise - who doesn't want cheap flights? However, there are lessons to be learned from its 
meteoric rise - and meteoric price hike for add-ons. From 2011 to 2016, the company's sharp rise in charges for 
"added extras" grew from 20 per cent to 27 per cent of its total revenue. Too often, we are lured in by cheap flights 
and forget to consider total costs. This is a growing trend, as airlines follow each other's models worldwide. 
Unfortunately, travellers can expect to see more charges for ancillaries and rules set in place to catch you out. With 
the rise of selfconnecting flights, flyers need to be more savvy than ever to ensure their wallets aren't stung before 
setting foot on a plane. Ryanair's pursuit of growth at all costs is in some ways admirable, but it has left staff 
stretched too thin. At some point, travellers may start to consider whether the compromise of a few extra pounds is 
truly worth the sacrifices of comfort, convenience, and feeling valued. Adam Ewart, chief executive, Send My Bag

It was announced today that Irish leading P2P (Peer-to-Peer) lending platform, Linked Finance, has raised €2m in 
equity funding to support its plans for expansion. 
The funding round was led by the company’s original venture capital backers, Frontline Ventures. They were joined 
by a group of 28 individual investors who are all active lenders on the Linked Finance platform.    Linked Finance 
recently appointed former Ryanair Deputy CEO, Michael Cawley, to the role of Chairman and completed its 1000th 
loan for an Irish SME in September. The company has now lent over €34.5m to Irish SMEs since its launch in 2013, 
with more than €14.2m already repaid to Linked Finance lenders.   Linked Finance plans to use the funds raised to 
support ambitious expansion plans. The company intends to establish P2P lending as a mainstay of the SME 
lending landscape in Ireland; replicating the type of success that this innovative form of funding has already seen in 
markets like the US and the UK.   It is hoped this equity raise will provide Linked Finance with the resources needed 
to ramp up sales & marketing activity; raising awareness of P2P lending and bringing the benefits of the Linked 
Finance platform to a much wider audience of Irish business owners.   Speaking this week, CEO of Linked Finance, 
Niall Dorrian said, "It is fantastic that we have been able to practice what we preach, harnessing the power of the 
crowd to open this investment round to some of our most active users. These lenders are people who know the 
platform inside out, they know what it's like to lend on the site and they really believe in what we do. It's great to 
have them on board, and also to have the continuing support of Frontline Ventures."

       BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - Assets of bankrupt Air Berlin will be bought by Lufthansa AG, reports said. The German 
airline has filed for insolvency on August 15, however negotiations for sale of its business have been going on with 
the support of the government.   The Lufthansa's move comes at a time when Air Berlin's discussions with EasyJet 
ended on October 12. EasyJet was said to be discussing to buy up to 30 planes.   Reuters reported that Lufthansa 
now plans to buy Air Berlin's Niki leisure unit, LG Walter regional airline and other aircraft. The reports said no 
contract have been signed, however agreement is reached.   Abu Dhabi's Etihad had been a minority shareholder 
of Germany's second largest airline and a major backbone in its financing. However, they refused to continue the 
financial support to the airline as the business deteriorated. Etihad had invested more than $2.2 billion in Air Berlin 
since 2011. The Abu Dhabi airline had to bear loss of around $808 million from its investment in Air Berlin, Alitalia 
and other equity partners airlines.  Air Berlin have been struggling from competitions from no frills airline such as 
Ryanair and EasyJet and recorded loss of more than $3.2 billion in last six years.

Ryanair captain Imelda Comer has offered to serve as "a conduit to enable constructive engagement" between 
management and pilots.
In a letter sent to the airline's chief Michael O'Leary and publicised by the European Cockpit Association, Comer 
stresses that the European employee representative committee (EERC) seeking dialogue with management is 
"exclusively made up of Ryanair pilots from several countries".
She adds: "The interim EERC represents the views of the collective pilot body, which wishes to proactively and 
constructively engage with the company to help resolve the current difficulties that continue to weigh on all of us."
Pilot representatives are, states Comer, "concerned about their security when they reveal their identities", but will 
do so once Ryanair has given them a series of specified assurances. These include promises that there will be no 
legal action, no scheduling of additional line or simulator checks, third-party handling of any disciplinary action, no 
change of base unless requested by the pilot, a minimum number of rostered hours, paid time off to engage in 
representative activities, and no unpaid leave except at request – all of these applicable until a year after 
representative duties are discharged.
The interim EERC, which intends to "provide a channel through which the whole pilot body can speak with one 
voice", has presented the company with a list of demands. Reiterated by Comer, this is topped by permanent local 
contracts and also includes co-ordination between national and regional pilot teams, benchmarking with regional 
competitor airlines "to stem the exit of pilots", and permission for pilots to have "their own professional assistance" 
in negotiations.
If they secure the changes they are seeking, pilots would be prepared to "surrender some of their leave to help 
resolve the current problems", Comer indicates.
Ryanair pilot urges carrier to engage in collective talks Ryanair captain Imelda Comer has offered to serve as 
"a conduit to enable constructive engagement" bet....
She notes Ryanair's policy of "only negotiating with pilots and only dealing with individual bases", and warns that 
this "will not resolve the deep-seated issues that have been imposed on pilots over the last 10 years and have 
cumulatively given rise to our most recent difficulties".
Flightcrew, she complains, lack the "time to properly prepare for or carry out an additional task that you [Ryanair] 
insist only pilots must fulfil", adding that "the complexity of pilots living, operating and moving around Europe 
exposes us to legal, financial, income tax and social insurance considerations that we do not have expertise in".
Accusing the airline of having "so far missed the point of what pilots require", Comer argues that "properly informed 
negotiations need to take place".
In a separate letter to colleagues, in which she urges them to support the EERC, Comer states that she has been 
with Ryanair more than 10 years and has "not seen anything like the level of pilot anger, frustration and 
disappointment arising from the way the company management has treated us in the recent past".
She argues: "Company management got us into this mess. They cannot solve these problems without us. To move 
our own representation in a new direction, we have to stop the company's usual rush to divide and conquer us."
Comer also reveals that she is "leaving Ryanair in the near future", adding: "I am sure the company will try to make 
a big issue out of that."
Ryanair describes the "letter from the so-called EERC" as "entirely disingenuous", adding that it "will not be 
corresponding with, or replying to, the false claims made" by the EERC, Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG), Ryanair Pilots 
Association (REPA) or "any other front set up by competitor pilot unions".
The airline states: "If Ryanair pilots wish to negotiate pay increases of up to 22,000 [$26,000] per annum or 
anything else with the airline, they are free to do so at all times through the existing base ERC structures, which 
have been validated by the Supreme Court of Ireland and have operated successfully for over 25 years without any 
invented claims about pilot 'security'."

 The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices on Wednesday.----------FTSE 
100 - WINNERS----------easyJet, up 3.0%, International Consolidated Airlines Group, up 1.5%. Shares in the airline 
operators were higher following the conclusion of the latest French air traffic control strikes on Wednesday morning. 
The strikes, which started Monday, saw the cancellations of hundreds of flights and affected flights passing through 
French airspace. The disruptions also had knock-on delays to other flights as well as those coming to and from 
French airports. "Despite the disruption caused by yesterday's French air traffic control strike, the likes of easyJet 
and IAG remain amongst the market leaders this morning, with investors hoping there will be upside for such firms 
in the wake of the Ryanair cancellations and Monarch collapse," said IG Group analyst Josh Mahony. 
Paddy Power Betfair, up 1.0%. Macquarie started coverage on the bookmaker with an Outperform rating. ----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS----------Mondi, down 8.2%. The Anglo-South African paper and packaging company warned 
its underlying performance for the full financial year will be "modestly below" market expectations due to continuing 
cost pressures and negative currency movements. Mondi reported 8% rise in adjusted operating profit for the third 
quarter ended September 30 to EUR245.0 million on the back of increased average selling prices and higher sales 
volumes. The quarterly results were dented by increased costs and negative currency movements. The company 
also recorded a charge of EUR30.0 million in the quarter relating to planned mill maintenance shut downs. Blue-
chip peer Smurfit Kappa was down 2.6%, and midcap peer DS Smith was down 3.3%.
Next, down 1.0%. Morgan Stanley downgraded the clothing and homewares retailer to Underweight from Equal 
Weight. ----------FTSE 250 - WINNERS----------Dunelm Group, up 4.0%. The homewares retailer said it maintained 
the "good momentum" from the final quarter of its last financial year, with revenue in the first quarter rising by 25%. 
Dunelm said its revenue increased in the 13 weeks ended September 30 to GBP247.9 million from GBP198.7 
million in same period last year. The retailer said that its like-for-like revenue also grew by 9.3% to GBP214.3 
million. Chairman Andy Harrison said "like-for-like sales were boosted by favourable weather comparatives" and 
Dunelm continues "to outperform the homewares market, with strong growth across the business, especially 
online". During the period Dunelm said it opened five new stores, increasing its portfolio to 165 stores, and is 
"legally committed" to a further five new stores, one of which is a relocation. "The retailer stated it continues to

'outperform' in the homewares market, which is impressive as companies like DFS have been finding trading tough. 
Dunelm's stock has hit a nine month high, and if the bullish sentiment continues it could target 816 pence &ndash; 
its 2017 high," said CMC Markets analyst David Madden. ----------FTSE 250 - LOSERS----------PageGroup, down 
5.5%. The recruiter saw third quarter profit rise, though performance in its UK operations, which is its largest 
market, lagged behind the rest of the world. Total gross profit for the quarter, which ended September 30, rose to 
GBP177.3 million from the comparative period's GBP158.6 million, a rise of 8.8% at constant currency and 12% at 
reported rates. However, UK gross profit fell by 7.6% at both rates to GBP34.9 million from GBP37.8 million, with 
the company blaming the UK's withdrawal from the EU and general political uncertainty. PageGroup said its outlook 
for full-year operating profit remains in line with current consensus expectations.

PASSENGER growth across Europe's airports is expecting to slow as airline troubles take their toll, according to 
the latest report from ACI Europe.
The European airport trade body said yesterday that during the peak month of August, traffic at airports grew 8.7 
per cent, but dipped from July's 9.6 per cent rate of growth.
While that is the best August performance so far this century, ACI Europe said airports are soon likely to be 
buffeted by the impact of troubles at several airlines.
Olivier Jankovec, ACI Europe's director general, said: "While the macroeconomic environment remains the best in 
years, we are probably going to see some further softening of passenger traffic growth in the coming months."
He added: "The woes of Ryanair are already taking their toll and the impact of the bankruptcies of Alitalia, Air Berlin 
and Monarch has yet to unfold. It is doubtful that the full extent of the capacity offered by these airlines will remain 
in the market."
Last month Ryanair announced a wave of flight cancellations due to the mismanagement of pilot holiday, later 
saying 34 routes would be suspended into next year.
There have been a raft of announcements surrounding airline troubles, with Monarch announcing last week it had 
ceased trading, after Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August and Alitalia went into administration in May. The easing 
in passenger traffic growth in August was primarily because of slower, though still significant, growth at non-EU 
airports, up 14.2 per cent in August compared to 17.5 per cent the month before.
Airline woes to soften European airport traffic
Heathrow continued to trail the rest of the European hub airports, with the London airport awaiting a capacity boost 
from its expansion plans.

CAN YOU imagine the business you are in being run as badly as any British government? I don't just mean 
Theresa May's government, I also mean past governments of David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, and 
others. I mean our future governments too, be it under the bold Boris Johnson, the cunning Jeremy Corbyn, or 
someone not yet in parliament. If there is one thing that the Brexit negotiations are throwing up, it is just how 
amateurish our political system is at dealing with hard-edged, full-on, in-your-face challenges.
Our political parties get away with promising the earth but then delivering dust.
How many times were we told by Brown that boom and bust had been abolished, only for him to preside over the 
biggest boom to bust of all? How many times were we told by chancellor George Osborne that he would wipe out 
the deficit, only for him to keep moving the target date? Nearly 10 years after the crash, with a decade of so-called 
austerity, we still have a deficit that is expected to last for five more years, while national debt approaches two 
trillion - before adding the cost of other liabilities such as PFI and unfunded pensions.
Our parties betray their own manifestos quicker than Ryanair cancels flights. They breach employment laws they 
force upon others, and ignore with impunity the competition, bribery and trade descriptions Acts they establish for 
business.
When it comes to the Brexit negotiations, there can be no such backtracking and betrayal. This is a delicate 
challenge that requires competency and consistency. If the current government is going to deliver the will of the 
people and stick to its promises better than Osborne or Brown ever did, attitudes need to change.
Faint-hearted politicians have no place in negotiating Brexit
There are many able people in Whitehall and Westminster, but our negotiators are being repeatedly undermined by 
a fifth column of civil servants, career politicians, and unelected luvvies who have clearly never haggled for a 
bargain at a car boot sale.
They tell us they know best how to negotiate Brexit - instead they need to give the Prime Minister more room and 
get behind her negotiating team.
Negotiations are tough and demanding. They require cunning, guile, and a straight face. Sure, our politicians can 
do soft cosy things, like Maria Miller proposing genderneutral passports and driving licences this week. But Brexit is 
about what really matters - our future economic prosperity - and the poorest are the most vulnerable (whatever their 
gender) if the politicians get it wrong.
A period of purdah in the Houses of Parliament would be preferable to all the mean-spirited secondguessing that 
only encourages EU belligerence.
May said that she required time to get her strategy and tactics in order. She made a good job of her Lancaster 
House speech last January, and invoked Article 50 when she said she would.
This week, the Prime Minister told us that plans were indeed being made for the growing possibility that the EU is 
not taking Brexit seriously enough and will not start discussing a trade deal in the time that is left to achieve one.
All this talk of a transition is undermining the very concept of a deal. I will repeat the blindingly obvious: you cannot 
negotiate a transition to a deal if you don't have a deal in the first place.
While we have a UK government and opposition that appears hell bent on conspiring to prolong the Brexit process 
(either so it does not happen, or so it is a calamity), we also have an EU Commission that is doing its utmost to 
demonstrate why we need to get out fast.
While my personal sympathies lean towards a unified Spain, the EU's prolonged silence over the horrendous 
scenes of police brutality in Catalonia belie the Commission's self-confidence that it could handle greater 
centralisation and a European superstate.
If by the end of this year it has become clear that the UK will be expected to pay tens of billions to Brussels for 
"access" to the Single Market when Canada has access without a fee; if we end up half-in and half-out of the 
Customs Union and cannot strike our own free trade deals; if we remain subject to EU laws and have the European 
Court of Justice ruling over us; and if we cannot change our immigration policies to suit our own needs, then we 
face a bad deal that we should not fear walking away from.
We should adopt an open trade policy with the whole world, with little or no tariffs, reciprocating WTO listed duties 
only where the malevolence of competitors makes it unavoidable - while savings in EU costs should fund a 
reduction in VAT to boost the consumer economy.
It is time to be bold.
Faint-hearted politicians should stay under their duvets.
Brian Monteith is director of communications at Global Britain and a former member of the Scottish Parliament.

Ryanair's announcement that it is canceling 18,000 flights between November and March has understandably 
evoked the ire of the 400,000 customers affected. And, hot on the heels of news that it was canceling up to 50 
flights a day from mid-September to the end of October, it is facing a PR nightmare and trouble with regulators. <br 
class="" /><br class="" />Amid the outrage, the reason for the cancellations has been largely lost. The airline said it 
"messed up in the planning of pilot holidays". But this is part of a major industry-wide problem. Ryanair might be 
one of the first to feel the pinch in Europe, but there is a global pilot shortage which has been a long time in the 
making.
The industry currently employs 500,000 professional pilots worldwide and reportedly needs another 600,000 in the 
next 20 years to cover the retirement of pilots and the 6% growth of another 35,000 airliners entering the global 
market. Shortfalls of pilots have already hit US airlines this year, starting with small regional ones, and have been 
visible in India and China for a while now. Ryanair is the first European airline to be hit.
The food chain of aircraft type, airline, salary, benefits and personal lifestyle preferences for pilots determines 
where they look to work. Long gone are the times where pilots were employed for life by one airline. Like 
employees in most industries these days, pilots are choosing and managing their careers.
The pilot shortfall spiral
Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair actually do a superior job in training new pilots into their first airline job, training 
far more than most other airlines. But the task for Ryanair is never ending, as many pilots will leave after three 
years (at the end of their initial commitment) when they have gained enough experience. Pilots tend to move on to 
airlines which give them better pay or working conditions, or offer a more suiting lifestyle such as long-haul flying or 
different home bases. As Ryanair expands, the demand for pilots is continually growing.
Airlines can manage occasional shortfalls with vacation embargoes where the crew is not allowed to take their 
holiday over a certain period. Sometimes, pilots have accrued several years of vacation and the airline can pay 
some of it off. But labour laws in Europe provide strong support for employees who want to take their holiday. Plus, 
when a pilot resigns for a new job, they often leave the next day as they have so many vacation days left, which can 
cause unforeseen gaps in scheduling.
Aviation industry needs 600,000 new pilots in next 20 years
This is a spiral which is hard for an airline to get out of when things get tough. It is a problem clearly forecast but 
often ignored, resulting in the need for airlines to apply quick and costly solutions.
It's clear that training schools, airlines, and other related institutions must work together to find sustainable solutions 
to the crisis. The attractiveness of careers as an airline pilot as well as job opportunities and mentoring for new 
pilots must be addressed. <br class="" /><br class="" />Young people have a range of opportunities for interesting 
careers. So it must remain attractive from a regional and global perspective. The salaries and benefits from airlines 
are part of this, as is support for training costs, either direct or via industry-based funding institutions. <br class="" 
/><br class="" />Otherwise, airlines will pay for the shortfall in the long run. An aircraft which is parked due to a 
shortfall of pilots is costly. The monthly lease rate of US$200,000 to US$700,000 per aircraft still has to be paid, 
which, together with the lost revenues and other provisional costs, easily amounts to a few million dollars per 
parked aircraft each month. Not to mention the PR nightmare from flight cancellations.
Ryanair must develop a strategy which secures a regular intake of pilots, acknowledging that these employees are 
key to its operations and need to be looked after and mentored. The fact that its main competitor EasyJet has no 
pilot problems at this time is a clear sign that a well-treated pilot workforce is proof of success.

French public sector workers took to the streets Tuesday to protest cost-cutting measures, with an airline alliance 
warning the strike action was likely to cause the cancellation of least 1,000 flights.
Unions are angered by government decisions to freeze pay for 2018, to make staff bear the cost of their first day of 
sick leave and to cut social employment schemes.
Public servants are also worried by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to reduce the 5.45-million-strong public 
sector workforce by 120,000 over his five-year term.
Some 209,000 protesters took to the streets across France, according to the Interior Ministry. The hardline CGT 
union put the figure at 400,000.
Macron already faced two days of strikes and protests last month over decrees making French labour law more 
flexible for private sector employees.
The CGT and leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon called the September strike action, which fell somewhat flat even 
as police estimated attendance at 223,000.
Tuesday's strike, by contrast, was backed by all the main public sector unions. The impact on public services was 
limited, however, with air traffic and the education sector the most affected.
European airline lobby group Airlines for Europe warned that at least 1,000 flights were set to be cancelled by the 
end of Tuesday due to strike action by air traffic controllers.
The disruption would affect flights passing through French airspace or hit by knock-on delays as well as those to 
and from French airports, spokesman Aage Duenhaupt said.
Flights cancelled as French workers strike over cuts
Almost a third of flights were set to be cancelled at major French airports including Paris Charles de Gaulle, Paris 
Orly, Beauvais, Nice and Marseille.
Air France said it was running all long-distance flights from the two Paris airports but only about 75 per cent of 
short-haul and medium-haul flights.
Easyjet said it expected a number of delays and cancellations starting on Monday evening and would inform 
affected customers directly. Ryanair announced more than 230 cancellations.
The Education Ministry said that 17.5 per cent of school teachers had joined the strike. French media reported 
classes cancelled in various primary schools.
The health service saw more limited action. The Paris public hospitals body saying only 4.8 per cent of its staff were 
on strike, almost half of whom had been called in to work anyway under rules to preserve services in the health 
sector.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has promised to take public sector concerns into account and compensate civil 
servants for a rise in a social security tax, but his overtures have not convinced the unions.
Macron himself is due to meet union and business leaders on Thursday and Friday.

Ryanair COO to resign in wake of rostering controversy

Ryanair chief operations officer Michael Hickey will resign from the end of the month, the airline said on Friday, 
becoming the first executive to leave since a rostering mess-up led to the cancellation of thousands of flights.
The Irish airline, the largest in Europe by passenger numbers, has in recent weeks disrupted the plans of more than 
700,000 passengers by failing to have enough standby pilots to ensure the smooth operation of its schedule.
Hickey was responsible for rosters when the disruptions began but that function was taken over by Ryanair's Chief 
People Officer, Edward Wilson, on Sept. 27 when the airline announced its second wave of cancellations.
"Over the past 30 years Mick Hickey has made an enormous contribution to Ryanair, especially the quality and 
safety of our engineering and operations functions. He will be a hard act to replace," Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
O'Leary told Ryanair's annual shareholder meeting last month that while the shortages were created by 
mismanagement in its rostering section, he took personal responsibility for the "cock up".
Asked by an investor at the Sept. 21 meeting if he had made changes to the rostering department, O'Leary said 
that it was "not the time to be taking people out and shooting them."
Hickey joined Ryanair as an engineer in 1988 when the airline was far from the dominant carrier it is today and 
became Director of Engineering in 2000 before taking over as Chief Operations Officer three years ago.
Ryanair said it would start the process of identifying and recruiting a successor and that Hickey would hand over his 
responsibilities over the next 3 weeks.
Ryanair COO to resign in wake of rostering controversy
After the cancellations sparked customer outrage and a wave of negative media coverage across 
Europe, Ryanair has been scrambling to appease its pilots and promised them significant improvements in pay and 
conditions on Thursday.
Ryanair has said reports it had a pilot shortage were false and that less than 260 of its 4,200 pilots had left so far 
this year amid some being poached by rival Norwegian Air Shuttle .
In a separate statement on Friday, it said it had hired 210 new pilots in the past 12 weeks, bringing to 822 the 
number who have joined since the start of the year. (Reuters)

European airlines set for further bumpy rides; Monarch's collapse after

More than 750,000 people woke up last Monday to discover what every holidaymaker dreads - their flights had 
been cancelled after the airline they were using had collapsed.
Monarch, the UK's fifth-biggest airline, had entered administration in the early hours of the morning after the group 
failed to find a last-minute buyer for the business.
On the same day, the UK government kicked off Britain's "biggest-ever peacetime repatriation" as it began flying 
home the first of 110,000 holidaymakers stranded overseas - an operation expected to take two weeks. But an 
estimated further 750,000 Monarch customers have seen their future flights cancelled.
The collapse of Monarch highlights just how cut-throat the European shorthaul market has become. It is the third 
failure of a European airline in six months. Air Berlin and Alitalia went into insolvency proceedings this summer, 
after struggling to cope with the intense competition from rival carriers.
While the European short-haul market has been extremely competitive for the past two decades, as low-cost 
airlines have aggressively grown their share of the market, lower fuel prices have contributed to an increase in 
competition in recent years.
European airlines set for further bumpy rides Monarch's collapse after failing to find a buyer highlights a fiercely 
competitive market that remains too fragmen....
"Some airlines have kept going longer than they would have and some have put more capacity in as a result of 
cheaper fuel," says Jonathan Wober, aviation analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. "But there is a self-correcting 
mechanism here - the capacity glut leads to plummeting unit revenues, and those that don't have the cost base to 
survive plummeting unit revenues eventually do suffer and disappear. You almost need that situation to cut the 
dead wood out."
Market share One of the critical problems has been the consumption of market share by the low-cost airlines over 
the past 30 years as they have aggressively focused on cheap fares. In Europe, this has seen carriers such as 
Ryanair and easyJet tear chunks out of the short-haul market.
Just 15 years ago, budget airlines had slightly more than 9 per cent of market share in Europe. Today, they provide 
more than 40 per cent of all scheduled airline capacity in western Europe as their networks expand.
This has led to a fundamental change in the market, with full-service carriers aping many of the practices 
successfully introduced by low-cost carriers. This has seen most carriers offer seat-only fares and charge for 
baggage and other services.
As a result, it has become much harder to differentiate between the service offerings from a low-cost airline to a 
legacy carrier as the market has concentrated on price.
Spanish battleground One of the fiercest battlegrounds in the market has been Spain. The flood of capacity into the 
country was one of the main reasons why Monarch gave up its fight after it was unable to compete with the low 
prices on offer.
The market, together with Portugal, represented about 80 per cent of its business after it had to reduce the amount 
of flights to Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia, where tourism suffered following terrorist attacks. Data from OAG, an air 
travel intelligence company, show that Spain has seen the addition of about 16m seats into the market over the 
past two years as carriers throughout Europe have added capacity after vacating high-risk markets. The key year 
was 2016 when there was year-on-year growth of 14 per cent. "In a mature market that is an almost unprecedented 
level of increase," says John Grant at OAG.
Troubled airlines The capacity of the troubled airlines is likely to attract interest from rivals. All three airlines that 
have entered insolvency proceedings this year - Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia - have one thing in common: they 
have been struggling for years. All three have seen their market share fall as more low-cost capacity moved into the 
market.
In the past three years, Monarch has been saved from collapse twice with emergency cash injections from London-
based investment group Greybull Capital, which bought the airline in 2014 - two hours away from insolvency. In the 
year to October 2016, Monarch reported a statutory loss of £291m, compared with a profit of £27m in 2015.
Germany's Air Berlin had been under pressure for a while after racking up losses of about (EURO)2bn over the past 
six years, and net debt of (EURO)1.2bn. It has struggled to compete with low-cost carriers and tried several 
different business models over the years.
Meanwhile, Alitalia's high cost base 'Some airlines have kept going longer than they would have and some have put 
more capacity in' simply could not compete with the growing penetration of low-cost carriers in the short and 
medium-haul European market. The Italian carrier has struggled to report a full-year net profit for more than a 
decade.
For Air Berlin and Alitalia, which have Etihad as a major shareholder, the situation worsened this year as the Gulf 
airline began unravelling its own strategy of buying up minority stakes in carriers to drive traffic to its hub in the Gulf 
after facing losses of $1.9bn in 2016. This saw it refuse to pump any further cash into the lossmaking airlines, 
leading to their administration.
European airlines set for further bumpy rides Monarch's collapse after failing to find a buyer highlights a fiercely 
competitive market that remains too fragmen....
Ryanair success In the crowded market, the big companies such as Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair have 
fared better.
Despite problems over recent weeks, Ryanair sits comfortably in the lead when it comes to operating margins, 
which highlight the various groups' contrasting fortunes. The Irish group had an operating margin in 2016 of 23.1 
per cent. Wizz Air is in second place with a margin of 15.7 per cent.
The troubled airlines have languished at the bottom of the table. Air Berlin and Alitalia had a negative operating 
margin of 8.8 per cent and 18.3 per cent.
Fragmented region However, despite signs of consolidation this year with the collapse of the weaker airlines, 
Europe's market remains very fragmented compared with other regions such as the US.
The biggest six airlines in the US provide 90 per cent of all the country's domestic capacity, while in contrast, the 
biggest six European carriers provide 43 per cent of capacity. There are more airline groups operating in Europe 
than in any other region in the world. According to OAG, Europe has a total of 217, compared with 100 in North 
America.
"The consolidation story [in Europe] is more about the weaker airlines exiting the market and the stronger ones 
growing their share organically rather than big M&A transactions," says Mr Wober.
The fragmented nature of the European airline market means it is less profitable than its North American 
counterpart. According to Iata, the airline trade association, North American airlines generate about half of the 
global industry profit, helped by the consolidation that has taken place that saw the merger of some of the biggest 
groups.
Carriers in North America are expected to post a $15.4bn net profit in 2017, compared with a $7.4bn profit for 
European airlines.
Consequently, Europe still has some way to go in the consolidation process.

after facing losses of $1.9bn in 2016. This saw it refuse to pump any further cash into the lossmaking airlines, 
leading to their administration.
European airlines set for further bumpy rides Monarch 's collapse after failing to find a buyer highlights a

Ryanair success In the crowded market, the big companies such as Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair have 
fared better.
Despite problems over recent weeks, Ryanair sits comfortably in the lead when it comes to operating margins, 
which highlight the various groups' contrasting fortunes. The Irish group had an operating margin in 2016 of 23.1 
per cent. Wizz Air is in second place with a margin of 15.7 per cent.
The troubled airlines have languished at the bottom of the table. Air Berlin and Alitalia had a negative operating 
margin of 8.8 per cent and 18.3 per cent.
Fragmented region However, despite signs of consolidation this year with the collapse of the weaker airlines, 
Europe's market remains very fragmented compared with other regions such as the US.
The biggest six airlines in the US provide 90 per cent of all the country's domestic capacity, while in contrast, the 
biggest six European carriers provide 43 per cent of capacity. There are more airline groups operating in Europe 
than in any other region in the world. According to OAG, Europe has a total of 217, compared with 100 in North 
America.
"The consolidation story [in Europe] is more about the weaker airlines exiting the market and the stronger ones 
growing their share organically rather than big M&A transactions," says Mr Wober.
The fragmented nature of the European airline market means it is less profitable than its North American 
counterpart. According to Iata, the airline trade association, North American airlines generate about half of the 
global industry profit, helped by the consolidation that has taken place that saw the merger of some of the biggest 
groups.
Carriers in North America are expected to post a $15.4bn net profit in 2017, compared with a $7.4bn profit for 
European airlines.
Consequently, Europe still has some way to go in the consolidation process.
'Some airlines have kept going longer than they would have and some have put more capacity in'

Ryanair disclosed late on 6 October the resignation of its chief operations officer Michael Hickey, who will leave the 
Irish carrier at the end of the month.
The airline has faced significant adverse publicity in recent weeks after cancelling hundreds of flights and rowing 
back on expansion plans amid rostering issues relating to pilots.
Hickey is the first senior executive at Ryanair to resign since the scale of the flightcrew staffing issues became 
apparent.
Speaking to FlightGlobal in 2015 on the challenges of running a large, dispersed airline with dozens of bases, 
Hickey insisted that "we don't have independent republics", with Dublin overseeing all operations.
Hickey moved into the post in late 2013, having previously served as director of engineering at the carrier.
Reflecting on Hickey's departure, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary states: "He will be a hard act to replace, 
which is why we are grateful he has agreed to continue in an advisory role to smooth the transition to a successor 
and to complete a number of large projects he is currently working on."
Ryanair has commenced the process of recruiting a successor.

Ryanair's operations chief has resigned and will leave the company at the end of October, the budget airline said on 
Saturday, amid widespread criticism of its cancellation of tens of thousands of flights.
Michael Hickey "will work on an orderly handover of his responsibilities" over the next three weeks while the airline 
finds a successor, Ryanair said in a statement.
"Over the past 30 years Mick Hickey has made an enormous contribution to Ryanair, especially the quality and 
safety of our engineering and operations functions," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Hickey will "complete a number of large projects he is currently working on including a multiyear engine 
maintenance contract and new hangar projects in Seville and Madrid," O'Leary said.
The resignation follows Ryanair's announcement that it plans to cut tens of thousands of flights over the next six 
months, including about 18,000 flights this month to accommodate a backlog of holidays for pilots. 
Hickey joined Ryanair as an engineer in 1988, rising through management to become director of engineering in 
2000 and chief operations officer in 2014, the company said.

Highlight: In a new Sunday Business Post podcast, media lawyer Paul Tweed calls for protections for ‘proper

Body
Top media lawyer Paul Tweed has called for controls on Ireland’s cripplingly high defamation awards, claiming the 
multimillion sums handed out in damages are “discrediting the law” and threatening the very existence of 
newspapers and other publishers.
In Legal Matters, a new Sunday Business Post podcast going live this Wednesday, the libel specialist who has 
represented Ryanair, Britney Spears and Gerry Adams, champions the role of the traditional news media against 
the march of the social networking giants.
Tweed talks to The Sunday Business Post about lobbying the government for tighter press regulation of Facebook 
and claims “somebody has got to take a stand” for newspapers and their related online editions.
“Facebook accounts for more than 70 per cent of the news for the 17 to 23-year-old demographic in the US,” he 
said.
“They get the news - they don’t pay for it, they don’t employ journalists, they literally just lift it, use it, get credit for it 
and advance their own commercial interests - and I think this is grotesquely unfair to the print media who are having 
to carry the economic burden at a time when they are under economic pressure.
“Print media has to be protected at all costs. There is no substitute for proper investigative journalism. And print 
media fits that bill.”
After 39 years with Belfast firm Johnsons Solicitors, Tweed has set up his own practice which will mainly represent 
North African, Middle Eastern and US clients suing the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter. Ex-Fatah leader 
Mohammed Dahlan and the Church of Scientology are already on his books.
Skyrocketing libel awards ‘threaten journalism’
In this month’s podcast, he talks about working 13-hour days, winning over an international client base, being 
ahead of the curve, and why now is the right time to strike out on his own.
His legal career veered towards defamation in the mid-1980s when two barristers were accused of fighting over the 
last chocolate eclair in a cake shop in Holywood, Co Down.
Since then, Tweed has taken on most of the major print titles in Dublin, London and Belfast. However, he insists his 
“soft spot” for newspapers is genuine and not business spin.
“You may think it’s a bit hypocritical for me to say that, given my history, but certainly over the years I’ve acted for 
many newspapers as well as acted against them, and I’ve always tried to give them a fair crack of the whip. But I 
think as a result of that work I’ve become addicted to the print media.”
He is critical of the lack of press regulation for social networking giants, many of whom have European 
headquarters in Dublin.
“We’re trying to get the government to look at this carefully. It’s obviously going to have to be an arbitrary 
intervention.
“A voluntary code is simply not going to work because the likes of Facebook are so vast in terms of their reach, the 
jurisdictions they operate in - and they are likely to come up with the excuse that we circulate our news in the United 
States where there is first amendment protection.”
Tweed is also calling for a rethink on disproportionate damages awards in defamation cases. Earlier this year, the 
European Court of Human Rights upheld a complaint from Independent News and Media (INM) that a €1.25 million 
award to PR woman Monica Leech was a disproportionate interference with freedom of expression.
“I think we’ve got to a point where there has to be a cap on jury awards. I think the jury still performs a very 
important function, but not [to] the extent of putting the lights out at not just a publisher, but somebody who has 
made a mistake,” he said.
“Not only is it disproportionate, it is not even serving the purpose it is intended to. The multimillion-euro awards are 
actually discrediting the law and the system and that is a problem.”
He said that, in his view, a six-figure sum was enough to vindicate a person’s reputation.

Highlight: Time for Ryanair’s heavy hitters to speak up 
Body
The low-cost airline Ryanair’s shareholders have been strangely silent up to now, but that may be about to change
One of Michael O’Leary’s regular replies to questions about drops in the airline’s share price is that, as the largest 
individual investor in Ryanair, he doesn’t care if the share price falls or rises in the short term. When you are a 
billionaire and have been in an unassailable position for more than two decades, you can easily make a glib remark 
like that and get away with it.
He rolled it out again a few weeks ago, in response to queries about the current controversy the airline has found 
itself in due to the mass cancellation of flights that has affected more than 700,000 customers and strained relations 
with his pilots across Europe, which look to be deteriorating further.
Ryanair shares hit an all-time high of just under €20 in mid-August, on the back of the airline’s forecast that it would 
carry 131 million passengers in its current financial year, and that it was on course to land a record profit of almost 
€1.5 billion. But the share price slid back at the height of the cancellations, and flirted with dipping below €16 in the 
last days of September, before recovering again somewhat.
I was at Ryanair’s annual general meeting last month. For most of the meeting the only other voice heard from the 
board was that of the chairman, David Bonderman, who rattled through the formal agm business at the speed of a 
Boeing jet. O’Leary then went on to do a question and answer session with the few shareholders who bothered to 
turn up while the rest of the board said nothing.
Also at that meeting were a few of the company’s advisers, some long-time supporters and a few stock market 
analysts. There were more journalists from Ireland and abroad in attendance.
Bonderman has been chairman of Ryanair for two decades. His experience in dealmaking is unrivalled. His TPG 
private equity firm has about $70 billion (€60 billion) of assets under management and he has been a director of 
Market Talk with Ian Guider
very well-known US companies. At the agm, as he has done for many years, he deferred to O’Leary to take 
shareholder questions.
As we’ve seen in other companies that have fallen victim to crises, an independent chairman is vital, particularly 
where there is a dominant personality in day-to-day control. Does Bonderman, after 20 years in the same 
boardroom as O’Leary, still fit that bill? One in ten of investors at the agm voted against his re-election. But it is not 
just the chairman who should hold executives to account.
Customers affected have been only too happy to vent their spleen at O’Leary. Consumer watchdogs, regulators, 
unions and many others have also had a go. But the one important group that has been silent throughout all of this 
has been the company’s big investors.
Customers matter, as do regulators, but the outside voices who have the real clout are the ones with skin in the 
game, and they are the big shareholders, the pension funds and asset managers. Those institutions have been 
reluctant to talk about events at Ryanair. And this has been the case for years.
It’s worthwhile going back to a decade ago, when O’Leary first made an attempt to acquire Aer Lingus, just weeks 
after its privatisation. Regardless of the money O’Leary was offering, there was little chance the government would 
have handed Ryanair the keys of the former national airline in the face of opposition from its workers and unions, let 
alone the huge regulatory hurdle the bid faced. Institutional investors, though, were largely silent, as they were a 
couple of years later when O’Leary tried once again to buy Aer Lingus.
What does it take for them to make their views known publicly? Have any of them raised issues with the board? 
And how are they managing the last few weeks?
The confidence of large investors is the saving grace for any company in the face of public criticism. They are the 
ones who get to meet management regularly and put their views and concerns to them – and, unlike customers, 
they are sometimes listened to. Have they taken, or will they take, Ryanair to task for the crisis that has dogged it 
for the last number of weeks? It is in their interest for Ryanair to get on top of this mess quickly.
What they will be listening to are the Ryanair quarterly results, due out in a few weeks. The months of July, August 
and September are when airlines make the bulk of their profits. Ryanair has twice now said there was no need to 
change its profit guidance for the year. If it now revises that figure down, I think we may finally see some of the 
major investors talking by selling their shares. Only then might O’Leary and the board of Ryanair start listening to 
what they are being told.

Highlight: IALPA says it has held meetings with over 1,000 Ryanair pilots 
Body
The Irish Air Line Pilots Association has said it has met with over 1,000 Ryanair pilots in the last 10 days to discuss 
how best to engage with the airline. IALPA has met with pilots as individuals and in groups of over 50 pilots at a 
time and said that many wanted to join a trade union.
In a letter to IALPA members in Ryanair last Friday it said: “At the meetings many pilots expressed an 
understandable desire to terminate the Employee Representative Council (ERC) system [used by Ryanair to 
negotiate with pilots].
“This method of engagement is a creature of management and the pilots we met would like to replace this ERC 
system with union recognition.”
IALPA said it was its view that the ERCs were “the only engagement process available to Ryanair pilots until 
something else is put in place.”
IALPA said it agreed that the ERC at each Ryanair base should conduct new elections and then collectively select a 
Euro-ERC (EERC).
“When this is done the base-ERCs should inform Ryanair that the EERC is the sole and exclusive representative 
body for Ryanair pilots.
“This EERC will then be a one voice vehicle for all the bases and therefore all the pilots in Ryanair.”
The elected EERC it said can then respond to offers from Ryanair rather than individual pilots.
“Only the EERC should reply to future offers,” IALPA said.
Ryanair pilots push for union recognition
It warned that as regards Ryanair’s most recent offer to pilots that “those who are experienced in collective 
bargaining and those who have spent some time in Ryanair know that it is a common tactic to issue offers designed 
to fragment and undermine the one-voice negotiating vehicle”.
“They should also know that imposed or dictated improvements by management could be rolled back as quickly as 
they are given out.” IALPA said the only way for Ryanair to be successful was to include its pilots.
“This can only come about through proper functioning processes to address legitimate Ryanair pilot grievances. At 
the moment a centralised EERC is the best means to do that,” IALPA said.
The pilots association also noted that there had been “up until very lately,” an “anti-pilot narrative coming from the 
very top of Ryanair”.

Ryanair pilots wary of O'Leary promises Airlines ; Carrier offers better pay and security as it battles cancelled 
flights crisis
Ryanair pilots wary of O'Leary promises; Airlines ; Carrier offers better pay 
and security as it battles cancelled flights crisis

Body
British and Irish pilots have delivered a chilly response to a promise by Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary to improve 
their pay and conditions as the airline battles a crisis over the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights, triggered by a 
shortage of cockpit crew.
The Irish carrier, Europe's largest by number of passengers, cut the flights because of a regulatory change that 
forced airlines to calculate crew flying hours over a calendar year, instead of its own fiscal year. This left it with too 
few standby pilots on its roster, after it had long fought accusations by workers' unions of overworking its crew.
In a letter sent to pilots on Thursday, Mr O'Leary promised them the airline would exceed rivals' rates of pay and 
improve job security.
However Brian Strutton, general secretary of British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa), said that Ryanair pilots 
believed Mr O'Leary "still doesn't get" their grievances. "Pilots from bases all over the UK have told us that they 
don't want halfhearted excuses to shut them up," Mr Strutton said.
"They tell us that they want genuine respect and for their European [employee representative councils] to be the 
recognised representative body for Ryanair pilots. Until they are given that, Ryanair will have a problem with its 
pilots."
Ryanair pilots wary of O'Leary promises Airlines ; Carrier offers better pay and security as it battles cancelled 
flights crisis
Ryanair's abrupt flight cancellations have prompted a backlash from consumer groups and regulators, as well as its 
crew, after several years of the airline trying to resurrect a brand that became associated with customer complaints.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority has accused the carrier of misleading passengers whose flights were cancelled 
about their rights and failing to give adequate information on refunds for meals, hotels and transfers.
Ryanair's pilots have long complained about working conditions and job security. Many who join the airline do so on 
a self-employed basis, which can limit their access to sick pay and cause complications when paying tax.
Balpa said the airline has become known as a short-term employer for entry-level aviation professionals who need 
to rack up their flying hours, instead of a destination job. According to the Irish Airline Pilots' Association, Ryanair 
lost 700 pilots in its past financial year.
Evan Cullen, chief of the Irish association, said clarification was required from Ryanair about the new benefits, 
which the letter said would include initial pay rises of up to (EURO)10,000 and 12-month loyalty bonuses of up to 
(EURO)12,000.
Ryanair declined to comment on the likely cost of the initiative or on its impact on profits, saying it was in a closed 
period before publishing halfyear results at the end of this month.

Sir, As Monarch customers take time from their working day to deal with cancelled flights, they must be met with a 
high standard of customer service from those picking up the pieces. This week, our research revealed that 
consumers dealing with customer service issues during office hours cost employers £28bn a year in lost 
productivity. Problems related to transport are the third most timeconsuming, costing organisations an average of 
£2.3bn - topped only by house purchases and tax queries. The average cost per employee is £1,194 per year, with 
over half claiming that their ability to focus is affected long after conversations with customer service staff have 
ended.
Monarch and Ryanair customers experiencing cancelled flights may be left feeling anxious, not least by spending 
working time dealing with the consequences. The responsibility now lies with airlines to ensure, where possible, that 
problems are prevented at source and that customer service interactions are right first time.
With so many badly affected, there is a clear call for boardrooms to focus on upskilling staff and implementing 
processes to ensure positive customer experiences should future problems arise. The combined impact on 
employee productivity and wellbeing translates into tangible loss for employers and the economy. The onus is on 
airlines to improve customer service skills to protect the productivity of the UK workforce. Jo Causon CEO, Institute 
of Customer Service

LONDON (AP) - The chief operations officer of Ryanair has announced plans to leave his post at the end of 
October following the cancellation of tens of thousands of flights scheduled for the coming months.
Company officials said Saturday that Michael Hickey will still have an "advisory role" after he steps down following 
decades with the airline.
He is the first senior executive to leave because of the damaging flight cancellations, which have disrupted travel 
plans for an estimated 700,000 passengers and undercut the company's bid to improves its customer service 
reputation.
The flights were cancelled because of holiday staffing and scheduling errors.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said Hickey had made an "enormous contribution" to the airline in the last 
30 years.

Have you been affected by the collapse of the UK's fifthbiggest airline? Booking an all-inclusive package holiday or 
cheap flight with Monarch might not be the kind of break that appeals. Even if you have never donned a plastic 
bangle giving unfettered access to a resort bar, Monarch's abdication will almost certainly increase costs for winter 
sun seekers.
Skyscanner, the air fares comparison site, reports an average 23 per cent increase in prices of last-minute flights to 
Europe for October, as about 750,000 passengers whose Monarch flights have been cancelled all rush to rebook.
The increased demand - particularly to Spanish airports - is expected to push prices above seasonal norms until 
January or February next year, the website said. It has seen its "click through" rate to airline booking websites rise 
by 86 per cent in the fortnight since Monarch's troubles began.
Hardly surprising then, that the share prices of rival airlines EasyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air soared on news of 
Monarch's administration this week. Analysts at Bernstein predict that reduced competition on short-haul routes will 
improve yields for rival budget airlines, at least in the short term.
For Monarch's customers, this is as comforting as a paper bag of cold sick. Although consumer experts think most 
people will get their money back - eventually - in many cases it won't be enough to rebook a similar trip. After the 
way that passengers were treated this week, this adds insult to injury.

Commentator of the Year
Monarch called in the administrators at 4am on Monday morning (when all of its fleet was grounded). By this time, 
unsuspecting holidaymakers were queueing to check in for flights they were destined never to board. Pictures 
appeared of distraught families whose holidays were cancelled and guests at now-ruined foreign weddings.
They were all sent home and other travellers were warned to stay away.
The UK authorities then mounted what it called the biggest peacetime repatriation. More than 110,000 
holidaymakers will be flown home in coming weeks, an operation expected to cost the government about £60m. 
The Civil Aviation Authority has pledged to provide return flights to the UK for passengers due to come back with 
Monarch before October 15.
Those who had flights and holidays booked must now begin a battle for compensation - itself a complicated and 
long-winded journey.
Monarch's package holidays would have been protected by Atol, the industry-funded protection scheme. The good 
news is you will get your money back (see the CAA website). The bad news is that experts predict this could take 
weeks or even months, and the price of rebooking similar holidays is rising.
Far greater numbers - about 750,000 passengers - will seek compensation from their bank, credit card or travel 
insurer for cancelled flights (these would not have had Atol protection if they were sold after December 15 2016). 
They will now need to rebook with another airline.
Many caught up in the initial disruption will have lost days of their holidays, owe money to hotels and car hire 
companies and might have had to cancel their trips altogether. However, as Monarch customers now find to their 
cost, many travel insurers will not pay out in the event of airline failure.
About two-fifths of travel insurance policies do not include this protection, according to research by Defaqto this 
week. Sadly, this doesn't surprise me. I wrote last week about the "hollowing out" of insurance cover as price 
comparison websites point us towards cheap policies. Picking the lowest cost provider will mean sacrificing what is 
covered - so check the small print.
If you can't claim for the cost of cancelled flights via your travel insurance, you should try your credit card provider. 
If the flight cost £100 or more, you could claim under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This great - if little-
known - piece of legislation means the credit card provider is jointly liable if there is a problem with something you 
buy.
Unlike other budget airlines, Monarch did not charge a fee for bookings made on credit cards. So there is reason to 
hope that more of its passengers may be entitled to this valuable protection.
For those who paid by debit card, there is hope in the form of the "chargeback" scheme offered by UK banks. This 
could get you a refund even if your flight cost less than £100, and many banks have pledged to honour Monarch 
claims. Contact your bank for more details.
Finally, PayPal has its own buyer protection programme which consumers can claim against if they don't receive 
the goods or services - but you must claim within 180 days of payment.
Get through all of that, and you will definitely need a holiday. But it is a crying shame that passengers who have had 
their holidays disrupted will now have to pay even more for the privilege.

news is you will get your money back (see the CAA website). The bad news is that experts predict this could take 
weeks or even months, and the price of rebooking similar holidays is rising.
Far greater numbers - about 750,000 passengers - will seek compensation from their bank, credit card or travel 
insurer for cancelled flights (these would not have had Atol protection if they were sold after December 15 2016). 
They will now need to rebook with another airline.
Many caught up in the initial disruption will have lost days of their holidays, owe money to hotels and car hire 
companies and might have had to cancel their trips altogether. However, as Monarch customers now find to their 
cost, many travel insurers will not pay out in the event of airline failure.
About two-fifths of travel insurance policies do not include this protection, according to research by Defaqto this 
week. Sadly, this doesn't surprise me. I wrote last week about the "hollowing out" of insurance cover as price 
comparison websites point us towards cheap policies. Picking the lowest cost provider will mean sacrificing what is 
covered - so check the small print.
If you can't claim for the cost of cancelled flights via your travel insurance, you should try your credit card provider. 
If the flight cost £100 or more, you could claim under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This great - if little-
known - piece of legislation means the credit card provider is jointly liable if there is a problem with something you 
buy.
Unlike other budget airlines, Monarch did not charge a fee for bookings made on credit cards. So there is reason to 
hope that more of its passengers may be entitled to this valuable protection.
For those who paid by debit card, there is hope in the form of the "chargeback" scheme offered by UK banks. This 
could get you a refund even if your flight cost less than £100, and many banks have pledged to honour Monarch 
claims. Contact your bank for more details.
Finally, PayPal has its own buyer protection programme which consumers can claim against if they don't receive 
the goods or services - but you must claim within 180 days of payment.
Get through all of that, and you will definitely need a holiday. But it is a crying shame that passengers who have had 
their holidays disrupted will now have to pay even more for the privilege.

companies This week started with the collapse of Monarch, the UK's fifth-biggest airline. It ended with a profit 
upgrade at easyJet. The tempting conclusion is that scale matters in short haul. The reality is more nuanced.
Air Berlin and Alitalia did not founder for want of size; the former carried 28m passengers a year. Nor is it true that 
smaller operators are doomed to fail. Look at Wizz Air, which reported strong traffic figures midweek and whose 
shares have almost doubled over the past year. Or Jet 2, part of Aim-traded Dart Group. Its profit margin before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is only just below that of easyJet, yet it carries a 10th of the passengers.
What is the secret? Picking a viable niche plays a large part. Monarch, with its main base near London, was directly 
exposed to heavyweight rivals. Jet 2 is more of a regional airline for northern holidaymakers. Until this year, it 
stayed out of busy and expensive London airports. Wizz has focused on central and eastern Europe, where growth 
is rapid. At Finnair, flights between Europe and Asia generate two-fifths of sales.
These last three are also tightly run.
Flybe, by contrast, has been held back by a legacy of excess capacity and high costs. It has made a profit only 
twice in the past six years. New management is rationalising the business, focusing on routes that lack the density 
larger carriers need.
Size is a bit like leverage. It can amplify existing advantages, such as a strong position at an airport or in a region. 
Or it can just cause a weak airline to lose more money quicker.

EasyJet posted record passenger numbers over the summer as it benefited from the struggles of rivals in the 
fiercely competitive European shorthaul airline market.
Monarch Airlines collapsed on Monday, the third carrier to fail in the region in six months after Air Berlin and Alitalia 
went into insolvency proceedings.
Despite a £100m currency hit after the Brexit referendum, easyJet said pretax profits for the year ending in 
September were expected to be between £405m and £410m, at the upper end of the previously guided range.
Profits are still below the £495m recorded by the budget airline in 2016, and down from £686m in 2015, but form a 
bright contrast to the collapse of Monarch and the flight cancellation fiasco at Ryanair.
During the three months to the end of September, easyJet, Europe's secondlargest European low-cost carrier, flew 
24.1m passengers, with capacity reaching a high of 95.6 per cent.
The headline cost per seat, an important metric for low-cost airlines, is expected to grow by about 1 per cent, 
excluding fuel and at constant currency.
But including fuel, this figure is expected to fall by 4.4 per cent. Overall, the fuel bill is expected to drop by £230m-
£235m compared with the previous financial year.
EasyJet lifted by record passenger numbers Airlines
Carolyn McCall, chief executive, said the market continued to be challenging. "EasyJet has had to absorb a 
significant currency impact of £100m in the year," she said. "However ... the current turmoil in the sector provides 
easyJet with opportunities to ... grow and strengthen our positions in Europe's leading airports still further."
Monarch's collapse marked the latest in a series of blows to Europe's low-cost carriers. Alitalia filed for bankruptcy 
in May followed months later by Air Berlin. Ryanair's crewing issues resulted in more than 2,000 flight cancellations.
"The European aviation industry needs to consolidate and easyJet is well positioned to capitalise on that," said 
Andrew Charlton, managing director of Aviation Advocacy.
Other analysts suggested that easyJet's profit projections could have been higher. "Fares have been rising in the 
short-haul market. There's been a lot of disruption of competition and the stock has been rising," said Rob Byde, 
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "Some investors were expecting a little bit more."
EasyJet expects to increase capacity by 6 per cent over the 12 months to September 2018, down from 8 per cent 
the year before. "Key for easyJet and the market is next summer," said Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy Research. 
"One of the reasons why revenues are down is that there's too much capacity, but by next summer Alitalia and 
Monarch will have been absorbed. The key modus operandi for easyJet is to gain strong positions in core 
[airports]."

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair's operations chief has resigned and will leave the company at the end of 
October, the budget airline said on Saturday, amid widespread criticism of its cancellation of tens of thousands of 
flights.  Michael Hickey 'will work on an orderly handover of his responsibilities' over the next three weeks while the 
airline finds a successor, Ryanair said in a statement.  'Over the past 30 years Mick Hickey has made an enormous 
contribution to Ryanair, especially the quality and safety of our engineering and operations functions,' said chief 
executive Michael O'Leary.  Hickey will 'complete a number of large projects he is currently working on including a 
multiyear engine maintenance contract and new hangar projects in Seville and Madrid,' O'Leary said.  The 
resignation follows Ryanair's announcement that it plans to cut tens of thousands of flights over the next six 
months, including about 18,000 flights this month to accommodate a backlog of holidays for pilots.   Hickey joined 
Ryanair as an engineer in 1988, rising through management to become director of engineering in 2000 and chief 
operations officer in 2014, the company said.   Copyright dpa

 The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.----------COMPANIES----------easyJet said it saw "record" 
passenger numbers and load factors in the summer of 2017, and now expects full-year profit to be at the upper end 
of its previous guidance. However, the airline warned it expects ongoing pressure on yields as capacity in the wider 
market continues to grow, while foreign exchange will also have a material knock on profit for its recently-ended 
financial year. The budget carrier said that it continued to drive passenger and load factor growth in the three 
months ended September 30, with "record" passenger numbers of 24.1 million, which drove a load factor of 95.6%. 
easyJet said passengers benefited in the summer benefited from low fares across the network, particularly on 
beach markets from the UK. "easyJet has finished the year with continued positive momentum delivering both a 
strong final quarter and a strong second half. 
Passenger numbers and load factor in the final quarter set new records and the second half profit was over 
GBP100 million higher than summer 2016," said Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall.----------Ryanair Holdings 
promised its pilots significant improvements in pay and conditions, stating it would exceed rates paid by rivals and 
improve job security, according to a letter to pilots seen by Reuters. The Irish airline, the largest in Europe by 
passenger numbers, has in recent weeks announced the cancellation of thousands of flights, saying it did not have 
enough standby pilots to ensure the smooth operation of its schedule. Ryanair will deliver "significant improvements 
to your rosters, your pay, your basing, your contracts and your career progression over the next 12 months," Chief 
Executive Michael O&lsquo;Leary said in the letter addressed to all Ryanair pilots.----------Thomas Cook Group 
pilots have called off eight days of planned strike action eyed throughout October after the airline and union bosses 
agreed to enter discussions on pay, Sky News reported on Friday. Members of the British Airline Pilots Association 
had planned to start strike action this Friday over a pay dispute, and further were strikes planned for three days 
from October 12 and for four days from October 19. Brian Strutton, general secretary of British Airline Pilots 
Association told Sky News: "Our members voted to end this dispute by binding arbitration, which Thomas Cook has 
now agreed to." "I am pleased that we have been able to find a peaceful way of resolving the pilots' pay dispute 
without further disruption to passengers," Strutton added.----------Glencore said it has entered into an agreement to 
buy a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa Proprietary and Chevron Botswana Proprietary. Glencore said it will pay 
USD973 million in cash from its existing resources for a 75% stake Chevron South Africa and certain related 
interests, as well as the entire issued share capital of Chevron Botswana. Glencore said the agreement covers the

interests of Chevron in its manufacturing, retail and industrial supply business in South Africa and Botswana. 
Glencore believes that these provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business and the agreement 
includes the retention of the local management team and workforce.----------CRH noted US-based cement firm Ash 
Grove's extension to obtain shareholder approval for a takeover by the London-listed building materials group. CRH 
said in late September it had agreed to buy Ash Grove for USD3.5 billion, with the transaction expected to close 
before the end of the year. However, Ash Grove also announced on Thursday it received a preliminary competing 
proposal from a third party to acquire Ash Grove at an indicated enterprise value of USD3.7 billion to USD3.8 
billion, potentially above CRH's bid.----------Ultra Electronics noted Sparton Corp shareholders approved the 
acquisition deal agreed earlier in the year. In July, Ultra said it planned to acquire Sparton for USD234.8 million, 
funded in part through a share placing. Sparton was a partner in Ultra's ERAPSCO joint venture which won a 
contract to make sonobuoys for the US navy in 2014. Ultra's own shareholders voted 96.8% in favour of the deal in 
August. The company said that although the transaction remains subject to "other customary closing conditions", it 
is still targeting a completion date by January 1, 2018.----------Lonmin said it has received consent from its lending 
banks to acquire interests in Pandora joint venture, South Africa, from partners Anglo Platinum and Northam 
Platinum. On August 7, Lonmin received approval from the country's Department for Mineral Resources to acquire 
the interests of Anglo American Platinum and Northam Platinum in the project. Lonmin is currently raising its stake 
in the joint venture to 100% through various deals that were announced in May. It expects the acquisition of Anglo 
American Platinum and Northam Platinum's interests to be completed before the announcing its full-year results in 
November, it said. Lonmin currently holds a 50% stake in the project, with Anglo American Platinum holding a 
42.5% stake and Northam a 7.5% interest.----------MARKETS----------London shares were higher with the FTSE 100 
hitting its highest level in two months, while the FTSE 250 hit a fresh record high of 20,157.31. The pound sank to 
its lowest level since mid-September, which is beneficial for dollar earning companies found mainly in the large-cap 
index. Wall Street was pointed to a flat to lower open ahead of the US jobs report for September at 1330 BST. -------

 Large-cap airline easyJet on Friday said it saw "record" passenger numbers and load factors in the summer of 
2017, and now expects full-year profit to be at the upper end of its previous guidance.
However, the airline warned it expects ongoing pressure on yields as capacity in the wider market continues to 
grow, while foreign exchange will also have a material knock on profit for its recently-ended financial year.  
The budget carrier said that it continued to drive passenger and load factor growth in the three months ended 
September 30, with "record" passenger numbers of 24.1 million, which drove a load factor of 95.6%. 
The summer trading update follows on from Thursday, when easyJet reported growth in passenger numbers and 
load factor in the month of September and in the rolling 12 month period. Passenger numbers were up 11% in 
September to 7.7 million from 7.0 million in a year ago, whilst load factor was also up to 93.6% in the month from 
91.1%.
easyJet's September trading figures followed on from peers International Consolidated Airlines SA, which on 
Wednesday reported growth across the board at Aer Lingus, Iberia and British Airways in September, with group 
traffic rising 3.1% year-on-year and capacity rising 1.3%. 
On Tuesday Ryanair Holdings PLC reported a 10% growth in monthly traffic for September traffic despite its flight 
cancellations. The Irish low-cost airline said September traffic grew to 11.8 million customers, versus 10.8 million 
customers in the comparative period the prior year. September load factor was up 2 percentage points at 97%.
FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air Holdings PLC also reported September traffic figures on Tuesday, showing 26.4% growth 
for the month compared to the prior year. Wizz Air, a European budget airline, said September passenger numbers 
totalled 2.7 million versus 2.1 million in the prior year period. Load factor for the month rose by 1.3 percentage 
points to 92.9%.
EXTRA: Ongoing Turbulence Overshadows easyJet 's Higher Profit Target
easyJet shares were down 3.0% on Friday at 1,245.67 pence, the worst performer in the FTSE 100. Meanwhile, 
IAG was down 1.0% at 611.44 pence, Ryanair was down 1.5% at 16.72 pence and Wizz Air was down 0.6% at 
3,114.00 pence. 
Returning to the update on Friday, easyJet said passengers benefited in the summer from low fares across the 
network, particularly on beach markets from the UK.
This is reflected in a year-on-year reduction in revenue per seat at constant currency of 3.7% in the fourth quarter, 
resulting in a 1.4% decline for the second half of the year. Despite the decline, the airline said this was "slightly 
better than guidance due to high load factors and strong ancillary revenue performance."
Meanwhile, the headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency for the whole financial year is expected to 
be around 1.0% higher than the year before, in line with expectations. Including fuel, the cost is expected to decline 
4.4%. 
Isolating the fuel bill alone, easyJet expects total fuel costs to be GBP230 million to GBP235 million lower than the 
last financial year. 
Capacity in the final three months of the financial year to the end of September grew by 8%, with easyJet continuing 
to build market share and number one and number two positions at key airports.
"easyJet remains focused on cost and has continued to drive structural improvements, such as longer-term 
capacity-related deals with Airports. Planned investment in resilience in operations in the summer months has 
delivered operational improvement, particularly at Gatwick Airport," said the airline. 
As a result of the positive summer, easyJet said it expects headline pretax profit to be between GBP405 million to 
GBP410 million, towards the upper end of its full-year guidance. That is expected despite warning that foreign 
exchange movements are to drag headline pretax profit down by GBP100 million for the year. 
In July, easyJet said it expected headline pretax profit for the full year to be between GBP380 million and GBP420 
million, up 3.5% to 14% from its original target to deliver annual profit of GBP367 million. 
In the 2016 financial year, pretax profit amounted to GBP495 million, having sank 28% from the year before.
Meanwhile, net cash at the end of September is expected to be around GBP357 million, as it enters "a year of 
significant investment in new aircraft." 
Carolyn McCall, easyJet Chief Executive, said: "easyJet has finished the year with continued positive momentum 
delivering both a strong final quarter and a strong second half. Passenger numbers and load factor in the final 
quarter set new records and the second half profit was over GBP100 million higher than summer 2016.  
"The market continues to be challenging and easyJet has had to absorb a significant currency impact of GBP100 
million in the year. However, easyJet continues to operate Europe's strongest network and the current turmoil in the 
sector provides easyJet with opportunities to capitalise on its strong customer proposition and grow and strengthen 
our positions in Europe's leading airports still further," McCall added.
Looking forward, easyJet said it plans to grow capacity by around 6% for the financial year ending 2018, and added 
that revenue momentum continues to improve. However, whilst revenue momentum continues to improve, the 
airline said it expects continued pressure on yields reflecting ongoing market capacity growth that is currently 
forecast to be around 5% in the first quarter. 
The airline will publish its full-year results on November 21.

Ryanair hit hard by cancellations

Ryanair on Thursday promised its pilots significant improvements in pay and conditions, saying it would exceed 
rates paid by rivals and improve job security, according to a letter to pilots seen by Reuters.
The Irish airline, the largest in Europe by passenger numbers, has in recent weeks announced the cancellation of 
thousands of flights, saying it did not have enough standby pilots to ensure the smooth operation of its schedule.
The move has sparked customer outrage and a wage of negative media coverage across Europe.
Unions have said a significant number of pilots have left Ryanair in recent months to get more secure contracts, 
better pay and improved conditions at rival airlines.
Ryanair last week said reports it had a pilot shortage were false, saying less than 260 of its 4,200 pilots had left so 
far this year and that it was in the process of hiring 650 more.
On Thursday Chief Executive Michael O'Leary sent a three-page letter to its pilots promising "significant 
improvements to your rosters, your pay, your basing, your contracts and your career progression over the next 12 
months."
The letter, addressed to "all Ryanair pilots," said Ryanair would "beat" the pay and job security offered by fellow 
Boeing 737 operators Jet2 and Norwegian Air Shuttle.
He repeated a promise to increase pilots' pay by between 5,000 euros and 10,000 euros per year at four key bases 
and to negotiate with pilots at other bases about increases. He also pledged to offer a loyalty bonus of between 
6,000 and 12,000 euros for pilots still employed at the airline in 12 months' time.
Ryanair hit hard by cancellations
But he added a new offer to match local employment conditions where they differ from the Irish contracts under 
which all Ryanair pilots work, another key demand of the pilots.
Changes to the roster systems would mean that "your days off will really mean days off," he added.
The conditions mirror demands made in a letter by pilots at a number of Ryanair's 86 bases last month. 
While Ryanair does not recognize trade unions, pilots have been using social media to organize in recent months.
The often outspoken O'Leary, who last month said he "would challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult

He said the critical comments made at last month's annual general meeting had been misreported and were 
specifically directed at pilots of competitor airlines and their unions. (Reuters)

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings Plc's Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary has made a personal 
pledge to its pilots to improve pay and conditions amid concerns about a revolt as the airline battles crisis caused 
by recent cancellations, reports said.  In a letter sent to the airline's 4,200 pilots on Thursday, O'Leary also 
apologised for changes that caused disruptions to their rotas and urged them to stay with Ryanair for a brighter 
future.  Meanwhile, the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association reportedly said the letter gave no details of the cost of the 
promises. 
'Our members have experienced Ryanair promises before and therefore we will need to carefully consider each 
point before we decide on a response,' it added.  The Irish budget carrier's crisis over the cancellation of thousands 
of flights started in the middle of September due to a shortage of cockpit crew following the rota changes, brought 
about to comply with new aviation rules.  As per the regulatory change, airlines need to calculate crew flying hours 
over a calendar year, instead of its own fiscal year.   The airline, said to be Europe's largest by number passengers, 
blamed the flight crisis on its own mistaken decision to force its pilots to take their remaining annual leave before 
the end of this year. This resulted in very less standby pilots to fly all its scheduled flights in September and 
October, forcing the company to cancel thousands of flights. These moves affect more than 700,000 passengers.  
In his letter to pilots, O'Leary promised them the company would exceed rivals' rates of pay and improve job 
security. As per reports, he has promised wage increases of as much as 10,000 euros and loyalty bonuses of up to 
12,000 euros tied to achievable performance targets.  'The changes will transform your pay and carrier prospects in 
Ryanair. If you have or are considering joining one of these less financially secure or Brexit-challenged airlines, I 
urge you to stay with Ryanair for a brighter, better future for you and your family,' he added.  In London, Ryanair 
shares were trading at 16.63 euros, down 2 percent.

AIR FARES to some of Europe's most popular destinations have rocketed up to 43 per cent since Ryanair 
cancelled thousands of flights last month and Monarch Airlines suffered an array of problems that eventually led to 
it collapsing into administration earlier this week.
The average price of a European flight ticket sold between 15 September and 2 October was 23 per cent higher 
compared to those sold between 25 August and 11 September, according to figures from travel website 
Skyscanner. Flight prices from Britain to Milan, booked after mid-September, were the most expensive, soaring 43 
per cent from £74.46 to £106.39. Meanwhile, ticket prices to Malaga, Alicante and Dublin rose 30 per cent, 27 per 
cent and 25 per cent respectively. More than 2m passengers have been hit by travel chaos caused by the two 
airlines. Analysts expect fares to rise in the future as the industry feels the pinch from rising costs and excess 
capacity.
Aerospace analyst Howard Wheeldon said: "I do expect airline ticket prices to rise because the current model is 
unsustainable. Despite the demise of Monarch and the problems suffered by Air Berlin, there is far too much 
capacity. Meanwhile the shortage of pilots which has been long forecast is making itself felt.
Wheeldon added that Ryanair's issues are merely a precursor of problems to come, and that in a few more years' 
time the low-cost carrier's "problems will be repeated across other European airlines" as rivals in the Gulf offer 
higher salaries to pilots.
Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at consumer rights group Which, said: "Ryanair's 
failure to inform people that they are entitled to be rebooked on another airline at no extra cost is leading to some 
passengers paying sky-high prices for alternative flights when the airline should be picking up the bill."
AIRLINE WOES SEND FARES SKY HIGH
However, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said UK consumers may face a spike in fares but prices will 
rebalance in the long-term.
"The collapse of Monarch on top of Ryanair's woes will undoubtedly have an impact on prices in the short term. In a 
very short space of time the number of flights available has reduced significantly and simple dynamics of supply 
and demand mean prices are likely to rise as demand outstrips supply.
"Ryanair is working hard to rectify its capacity issues and low cost rivals will be looking to snap up airport slots, 
routes and staff from Monarch, so over time you'd expect the market to rebalance itself because it is still a very 
competitive area."
This comes as Italy's civil aviation authority said yesterday it was preparing to impose sanctions on Ryanair over its 
handling of mass cancellations of flights last month.

The demise of Monarch Airlines during its 50th year of operations may have surprised plenty of its customers, but it 
was perhaps inevitable that there would be a casualty in the overcrowded market from the UK to popular 
Mediterranean holiday resorts.
UK-based Monarch completed its transition to scheduled-only short-haul operator in mid-2014 – a strategy shift 
effected not because it saw any great untapped potential in that sector, but because its previously core charter 
market was "structurally flawed", the carrier's chief executive Andrew Swaffield said at the time.
While the move had a logic given that passengers were increasingly creating their own holiday packages via the 
internet, the unfortunate consequence was that Monarch's business model was put in direct competition with low-
cost giants such as EasyJet and Ryanair.
Monarch arguably still held some limited market advantage over competitors in flying traditional package-holiday 
routes to North Africa and Turkey, largely through its historical brand association with those destinations.
But when these holiday markets fell out of vogue in the UK, amid uncertain geopolitical circumstances – and having 
jettisoned long-haul operations as part of an earlier restructuring – Monarch had little option but to return to crowded 
European sun and sand markets.

ANALYSIS: How Monarch ran out of room in crowded market The demise of Monarch Airlines during its 50th 
year of operations may have surprised plenty of its custo....
The situation was exacerbated by developments such as UK leisure operator Jet2's encroachment on its markets 
by establishing bases in Birmingham and London Stansted, backed by a strong presence in the north of England.
That market saturation, and consequent pressure on yields, meant that as Monarch's financial situation worsened, it 
lost attractiveness as a takeover target for rivals and as a continued investment for already bruised shareholder 
Greybull Capital.
Put another way, Monarch increasingly looked like part of the problem rather than the solution to overcapacity in 
Europe – a region that has been ripe for consolidation for a while now.
TESTING NETWORK
FlightGlobal schedules data shows Monarch was operating just over 100 routes from UK airports during its last full 
month of operations – September 2017.
The flights operated out of five UK airports: the two London airports of Luton and Gatwick, Birmingham, Leeds 
Bradford, and Manchester. The bulk of its operations were from Birmingham, Gatwick and Manchester.
Almost half of these services were on routes to Spain, while almost a combined third of the routes served Portugal, 
Italy and Greece.
Notably, Monarch was serving only six routes in Turkey – mostly to Dalaman. That compares with the 13 Turkish 
routes it operated three years ago. Turkey had accounted for the second-highest share of Monarch capacity in 
September 2014. Last month, it represented the fourth highest, having slipped behind Italy and been overtaken by 
Portugal.
The reduced Turkish operation reflected terrorist activity and the attempted coup in the country last year, hitting 
leisure travel demand. The same had happened to Tunisia, after the June 2015 attacks in Sousse, while the 
downing of a MetroJet aircraft over Sinai in the autumn of that year hit Egyptian demand. UK operators are still 
blocked from serving key resort Sharm el-Sheikh on the basis of a UK government travel advisory.
Egypt and Tunisia – to which Monarch served seven and two routes, respectively, in September 2014 – 
disappeared completely from its network. Egypt had been Monarch's fifth-biggest market in terms of seat capacity 
three years ago.
Instead, Monarch put more emphasis on Portugal. In September, the carrier operated 14 Portuguese routes, 
compared with six the same month three years ago.
But others also focused on this market. FlightGlobal schedules data shows that in September only one of its 14 
Portuguese routes was uncontested: Birmingham-Lisbon. Notably, on routes to the Algarve gateway Faro – to 
which it operated from all five of its UK airports – it was in competition with at least three different carriers.
Spain, where it retained a similar-sized operation, was likewise heavily contested. For example, the airline was one 
of seven operators serving Malaga from both Birmingham and Manchester in September. Three years ago, there 
were five airlines operating from Manchester and only two from Birmingham.
Capacity more than doubled on Birmingham-Malaga, with roughly 200 more flights added in September to make 
334 frequencies last month. While incumbents Monarch and Ryanair both upped their capacity, almost three-
quarters of the extra flights were from new players on the route.
NARROW YIELDS IN NARROWED FIELD
While airline collapses usually result in rival carriers moving in to hoover up the demand, existing high capacity in 
the market means it is not clear the same thing will happen this time – at least in the short term.
ANALYSIS: How Monarch ran out of room in crowded market The demise of Monarch Airlines during its 50th 
year of operations may have surprised plenty of its custo....
For example, overall seat capacity from the UK to Portugal and Spain this September is up 16% and 8% 
respectively on the same month last year.
Airlines will heave "a great collective sigh of relief that something has happened to break the mould", suggests Carl 
Denton, managing director of Sven Carlson Aviation Consulting, considering the wider market impact of Monarch's 
collapse.
Denton says that airlines had been "stuck in the same groove" and that the collapse of Monarch might be the 
"nudge the record needed", leading to a shakeout in the UK market. He says there was so much capacity going to 
the western Mediterranean that yields were "catastrophic" and "wafer thin".
He does not expect any of Monarch's vacated routes to be taken up by rivals, given the amount of competition still 
on those routes.
"They say possession is nine-tenths of the law, and where you don't have exclusivity it's a really gloomy picture 
where you have to fight everywhere for market share," he says.
Adding to the situation is that Ryanair has its own challenges around capacity. The Irish carrier has expanded 
rapidly in Portugal and Spain – operating, respectively, 30% and 12% more seat capacity to these countries on 
routes from the UK in September, compared with the same month last year.
While the carrier has barely used its pilot-rostering challenges to suspend routes into Spain and Portugal – its 
Glasgow-Las Palmas and Newcastle-Faro links are the only ones of the 34 routes suspended over the winter to link 
the UK with either country – the challenge of serving its existing network this winter with 25 fewer aircraft leaves it 
with less room to manoeuvre than usual.
Rival carriers, meanwhile, may be more interested in taking advantage of any pickings in the German and Italian 
markets instead, given the major restructuring in play at Air Berlin and Alitalia.

The UK government will be hit with a £60m bill to bring home the 110,000 holidaymakers stranded overseas after 
the collapse of Monarch Airlines.
The low-cost carrier and tour operator, the UK's fifth-biggest airline, entered administration in the early hours of 
Monday, leading to the start of Britain's "biggest ever peacetime repatriation", which will be carried out over the next 
two weeks.
The Department for Transport said it hoped to reduce the £60m cost to taxpayers by sharing some of the bill with 
credit card companies and tour operators.
The Civil Aviation Authority is to charter more than 30 aircraft to bring Monarch customers home. On Monday, it 
completed 61 flights, returning 11,843 people. It planned to bring back another 11,000 customers yesterday.
The operation is due to finish on October 15, by which time about 96 per cent of Monarch's customers will have 
been brought home. Those who miss the deadline will be brought back on another airline's flight if they are 
protected under the Atol scheme for package holidays. Otherwise, they will have to book their own flight.

Administrators from KPMG were appointed on Monday after Monarch held emergency talks at the weekend with 
regulators. All of its 750,000 future bookings have been cancelled. The administrators said that 1,858 employees 
out of 2,100 at Monarch Airlines and Monarch Travel Group had been made redundant.
KPMG will now focus on the sale of Monarch's assets, which largely centre around the airline's slots at UK airports, 
in particular its valuable spots at London Gatwick. Analysts have estimated that Monarch has about 5 per cent of 
the Gatwick pool.
Other assets include prepaid fuel, property, plant and equipment. KPMG said negotiations would continue with a 
number of interested parties.
Airlines are likely to move fast to hire Monarch's staff, particularly its pilots.
This could help ease staffing pressures at Ryanair, where pilot shortages have resulted in Europe's biggest low-
cost airline having to cancel about 20,000 flights over the next five months.
Virgin Atlantic has announced a fasttrack scheme to help Monarch pilots join its fleet as First Officers.
The collapse of Monarch is the third failure of a European airline in six months. Air Berlin and Alitalia went into 
insolvency proceedings this summer as intense competition in Europe's short-haul market has put pressure on 
weaker carriers.
Ryanair said yesterday that it had continued to expand its passenger numbers in September despite the flight 
cancellations. Traffic climbed 10 per cent year on year in September to 11.8m, matching the pace from the previous 
month. Load factor, an important gauge for how efficient the airline is at filling its seats, rose to 97 per cent from 95 
per cent in the same month last year.

ATROUBLING period for the travel industry became worse this week as Monarch Airlines collapsed. Were its 
problems foretold by our brand tracking data? It is certainly true that internal problems in some of Monarch's key 
destinations - such as Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey - had an impact on its business, as well as the fall in the value of 
the pound that left it paying £50m a year more for its fuel and aircraft.
But YouGov's BrandIndex shows the airline was also struggling with its own offer against the continued rise of 
budget airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
This is particularly true with younger customers. Our Millennial Travellers report, published earlier this year, 
confirmed that this group is more inclined to take shorter breaks, involving a higher degree of self-planning - a 
traveller distinct from one that would fly with Monarch in its package-holiday heyday.
Monarch's value for money score among the 18-34s age group over the last three years has remained flat at 
around five, but it has been taken over by Ryanair - which has moved from minus 11 to 14 (prior to its own recent 
difficulties).
Easyjet has outstripped both rivals on this front, moving from 25 to 32 over the same time period.
Similarly, among those that have had a short-haul flight in the past 12 months, Ryanair's value for money score has 
jumped from minus 14 to five, while Monarch has remained at eight. Easyjet is way ahead on 34.
Of course, those at the higher end of the market are also under pressure to compete on price. Looking at British 
Airways, its own value for money score has declined over the past three years, dropping from 10 to minus two. 
Similarly, Virgin Atlantic's score has moved from 10 to three.
How our data helps to explain Monarch 's fall
From a consumer perspective, the demise of the airline is likely to be more keenly felt by those aged 55 and over, 
who may have a greater affiliation with the brand. Monarch's impression score (whether a respondent has a 
favourable impression of a brand) prior to its closure among that age group is nine, against five with 18-34s.

Why investors should still fly Ryanair : top managers' view

Highlight: Citywire Selector asked if stock-pickers are in it for the long-haul with the underfire budget carrier.
Body
Discount airline Ryanair faces a &pound;25 million compensation bill after cancelling more than 2,000 flights last 
month to comply with regulations regarding pilots' flying hours.
The Irish group's operating costs are also likely to increase as it hires more staff to cope with weather disruption 
and other potential delays.
This hardship came against the backdrop of UK-based airline Monarch going into administration, which led to a 
government-backed repatriation of around 110,000 travellers.
With so many headwinds facing the industry, is it time for investors to check out of airline stocks or is this merely 
turbulence on an otherwise smooth ride?
Wings not clipped
Unigestion's Eoin Maher, who works on the firm's equity team with Citywire A-rated Alexei Jourovski, said, despite 
earnings downgrades, Ryanair's increased costs could be absorbed and the stock was in a comparatively good 
position.
‘Reputational damage, while noisy in the short term, will be limited in light of their broadening, low cost offering. 
Given the cost advantage at which they operate - especially relative to legacy peers - they retain the potential to 
maintain profitability while lowering fares to drive volumes,' Maher said.
‘Ryanair is actively growing in primary, central airports while shrinking in many secondaries. The company now has 
a presence in two thirds of the top 50 airports in Europe.'
Maher added that over half of the company's growth areas were on routes where it had a pre-existing monopoly or 
was entering the market as the only carrier on the route.
‘Ryanair is launching new, thicker routes, driving up average frequency. They are adding capacity onto routes with 
considerably higher cost structures than their own average pricing point,' he said.
'Remarkable resilience'
Why investors should still fly Ryanair : top managers' view
Citywire AA-rated Mike Clements, who is head of European equities at Syz Asset Management, said the company 
is doing better than expected, but bargain hunters would be disappointed.
‘Despite being mired in a two-fronted war against its own disillusioned pilots and furious customers, Ryanair's share 
price has shown remarkable resilience. 
‘The crisis-hit airline has seen its stock price cushioned by underlying positive data; the firm's September traffic 
figures, which encompass the initial 2,100 cancellations announced, show passenger traffic increased to 11. 8 
million. Furthermore, the collapse of rival budget airline Monarch has buoyed the stock.
'So despite an apparent perfect storm of negativity around the stock, there has not been an attractive entry point for 
contrarian, long-term investors.'
Cleared for take-off
Maher said Ryanair makes revenue from streams, not just flights. This could benefit the company in the long run,
'Ancillary revenue opportunities, like cross selling, still have large potential. To the extent that we could see in 
greater unionisation of their labour force over the longer term, this could impact profitability.
'However, their cost advantage over peers extends beyond labour and they remain well placed to take share in the 
airline industry in Europe,' Maher said.
'Ryanair won't remain immune from industry wide risks relating to over-capacity - especially in a lower for longer oil 
price scenario - and reputational damage will manifest itself in a slight de-rating of the stock in the near term.
'In the context of the wider airline industry, the positive elements of the investment case remain intact despite recent 
dislocations.'

WIZZ Air and Ryanair yesterday announced growing traffic for September, despite the latter unveiling mass flight 
cancellations.
Hungarian carrier Wizz Air reported a 26 per cent rise in passenger numbers, with load factor - an industry measure 
of bums on plane seats - up to 92.9 per cent.
The Irish airline, meanwhile, reported a 10 per cent rise in traffic to 11.8m customers, with customer load factor 
rising to 97 per cent.
Ryanair said the figures included the 2,100 flight cancellations in September and October, after it admitted 
mismanaging pilot holiday.

 Equities markets were continuing their strong run Tuesday, with New York setting new record highs, Tokyo 
following with a 1% gain, and Hong Kong joining in after being shut for a holiday on Monday. London was called 
slightly higher, amid continued weakness in the pound.
As rival airlines circled the carcass of Monarch, Ryanair said Tuesday its passenger traffic was up 10% in 
September to 11.8 million, noting it has refunded or re-accomodated 98% of the customers affected by its recent 
flight cancellations.

being repatriated following the collapse of travel firm Monarch, which has left nearly 2,000 employees out of a job. 
More than 11,000 passengers were expected to depart for the UK by Monday night, less than 24 hours after the 50-
year-old company went bust. While those already abroad await news of alternative flights back to the UK, a further 
three quarters of a million people who held future bookings with the firm have had their travel plans thrown into 
disarray. In a letter to staff, Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield said the "root cause" of the airline's plunging 
revenues was terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, as well as the "decimation" of the tourist trade in Turkey. The 
group's engineering operation, Monarch Aircraft Engineering, is not in administration and continues to trade 
normally.----------Talks aimed at averting a strike by Tube drivers in London have been adjourned and will resume

Brexit negotiations is expected to be rejected as insufficient by MEPs on the eve of her crunch speech to the 
Conservative Party conference. The UK prime minister last month travelled to Florence to make offers to the EU on 
withdrawal issues including a financial settlement, citizens' rights and the Irish border, in an effort to push talks on to 
a future trading relationship. But on Tuesday the European Parliament will debate and vote on a motion which 
states that the required "sufficient progress" has not yet been made for talks on a post-Brexit trade deal to begin. 
Britain had hoped to have advanced enough for EU leaders to green light trade discussions this month.----------
Stephen Paddock, the gunman believed to have killed at least 59 people and injured more than 500 in Las Vegas 
Sunday night, was a 64-year-old white man and US citizen. Police said they had "no working motive" for the 
shooting. Paddock had no police record and was not known to police for any prior acts of violence. The shots were 
fired from the window of a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Paddock checked into the room on 
Thursday. Paddock was dead when police officers stormed the room, leading police to believe he killed himself. 
The alleged shooter lived in a retirement community in Mesquite, about 130 kilometres from Las Vegas, described 
by police as "really quiet" and "a low-crime area."----------BROKER RATING CHANGES----------HSBC RAISES

Ryanair's disclosure that passenger numbers jumped 10% in September, even amid flight cancellations, underlines 
the extent to which the budget carrier is still growing despite the pilot-rostering challenges that have clipped its 
planned expansion.
The airline has today detailed passengers numbers that, on an earned-seat basis, were up 10% at 11.8 million in 
September – a month which includes more than 2,000 flight cancellations. While below the 12% rise recorded for 
the rolling year to date – and only incorporating two weeks of cancellations – this still illustrates a strong growth 
rate.
Ryanair had initially hoped to confine flight cancellations to six weeks in September and October after the scale of 
an over-allocation of pilot leave became clear. But the airline subsequently opted to ground 25 aircraft over five 
months during the winter and will operate 10 aircraft fewer than planned next summer, in a bid to draw a line under 
the pilot-rostering issue once and for all. The carrier will suspend 34 routes between November and March 2018.
The impact will be a slowing in its capacity growth over the winter months, from 9% to 4%, and the airline now 
expects to carry two million fewer passengers in flying 129 million over the year ending 31 March 2018 – and four 
million fewer in flying 138 million the following year.
But that still represents not only the highest figure of passengers carried by a European airline, but also strong 
growth for the year overall. Ryanair remains in the rapid expansion mode it has been in since ending its fleet-growth 
hiatus with a major follow-on Boeing 737-800 order in 2013.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair still among biggest despite capping growth Ryanair 's disclosure that passenger numbers 
jumped 10% in September, even amid flight cancellation....
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that as of 28 September, Ryanair was set to lift capacity around 11% in terms of 
flights over the five months from November to March compared with the same five-month period in 2016-17. That 
includes a little over 27,000 additional flights. Ryanair says it is cancelling around 18,000 flights, meaning it will still 
operate around 9,000 more flights this winter than in the same period last year.
That would still involve the carrier growing faster, in absolute terms, than most in Europe. And even after the cuts, it 
will still by a distance operate more flights than any other European carrier this winter.
SERVICE INTERRUPTION
Details of the routes impacted show that much of the Irish carrier's UK domestic network will be suspended over the 
winter season as part of efforts to tackle its pilot-rostering issues.
The airline, which only resumed UK domestic operations three years ago, will suspend its London Stansted routes 
from Edinburgh and Glasgow, as well as its Belfast link to London Gatwick. That leaves flights from Derry to 
Liverpool and Glasgow as Ryanair's only UK domestic routes over the winter period.
The UK is one of the most impacted countries in terms of its representation among the 34 routes Ryanair is 
suspending between November and March. Eleven routes covering six UK airports are on the list.
But the biggest country casualty among routes being suspended is Italy. Fourteen services, including seven from 
Trapani, are being put on hold during the winter.
Greece, Poland and Germany are also among the most impacted countries, while the Bulgarian capital Sofia, 
German city Hamburg and Thessaloniki in Greece each have five services being suspended.
PROFIT FORECAST UNCHANGED
Ryanair put the cost of the initial cancellations at up to 25 million – a combination of the lost profitability and the 
passenger compensation.
It also put the cost of flight vouchers for all impacted passengers, subsequently announced as part of its later round 
of flight cancellations, at no more than 25 million.
It also expects slightly lower yields over the next two months as it undertakes various seat sales. But Ryanair has 
not changed it full-year guidance of a net profit of 1.4-1.45 billion.
Likewise, it adds: "Over the next two years as Ryanair hires more pilots and raises pilot pay, costs will rise slightly 
but we don't believe this will impact profitability."
Until recently, the carrier had a practice of voluntarily grounding some aircraft over the winter rather than operating 
them on routes that were loss-making during those months. New airport deals and a greater emphasis on routes 
with a business appeal to mitigate seasonality have altered that picture. But cancelling routes during the lower-
yielding winter months limits the lost revenue. The extra notice also means cancellations are not eligible for EU 
passenger compensation.
While Ryanair's profit expectations are undented, this should be set in the context of relatively strong European 
carrier financial performance. Ryanair left its outlook unchanged despite a strong first quarter, but several European 
carriers – admittedly, most operating to a calendar year and thus at the halfway stage of their financial years – lifted 
their profit outlooks, including Austrian Airlines, Finnair, Icelandair, Lufthansa and SAS.
A profit within Ryanair's guidance would still mark an improvement on the 1.32 billion net profit it recorded for the 
year ended March 2017. That was the third-highest profit, net, among European airline groups for the last financial 
year.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair still among biggest despite capping growth Ryanair 's disclosure that passenger numbers 
jumped 10% in September, even amid flight cancellation....
There has been impact on the carrier's share price. This has fallen from a year-high of just over 19 in the middle of 
September to its current price hovering below the 17 level. That, though, is in the context of continued strong 
growth over most of the year. The share price has been climbing from 12 a year ago.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary has also spoken of reputational damage for the carrier. After the biggest publicity hit 
since Ryanair's adoption of its more customer-friendly "Always getting better" campaign, O'Leary responded in 
direct but contrite fashion. "This is a mess of our own making," he said following the first round of cancellations. "I 
apologise sincerely to all our customers for any worry or concern this has caused them."
The flight cancellations also represent the first big setback for Ryanair's overhauled management team. The carrier 
appears to have identified a need for a tighter grip on operations: its chief people officer Eddie Wilson has taken 
over the pilot recruitment and rostering function, and the airline has abandoned any interest in bidding for Alitalia, in 
order to "eliminate all management distractions".

But the biggest country casualty among routes being suspended is Italy. Fourteen services, including seven from 
Trapani, are being put on hold during the winter.
Greece, Poland and Germany are also among the most impacted countries, while the Bulgarian capital Sofia, 
German city Hamburg and Thessaloniki in Greece each have five services being suspended.
PROFIT FORECAST UNCHANGED
Ryanair put the cost of the initial cancellations at up to 25 million – a combination of the lost profitability and the 
passenger compensation.
It also expects slightly lower yields over the next two months as it undertakes various seat sales. But Ryanair has 
not changed it full-year guidance of a net profit of 1.4-1.45 billion.
Likewise, it adds: "Over the next two years as Ryanair hires more pilots and raises pilot pay, costs will rise slightly 
but we don't believe this will impact profitability."
Until recently, the carrier had a practice of voluntarily grounding some aircraft over the winter rather than operating 
them on routes that were loss-making during those months. New airport deals and a greater emphasis on routes 
with a business appeal to mitigate seasonality have altered that picture. But cancelling routes during the lower-
yielding winter months limits the lost revenue. The extra notice also means cancellations are not eligible for EU 
passenger compensation.
While Ryanair's profit expectations are undented, this should be set in the context of relatively strong European 
carrier financial performance. Ryanair left its outlook unchanged despite a strong first quarter, but several European 
carriers – admittedly, most operating to a calendar year and thus at the halfway stage of their financial years – lifted 
their profit outlooks, including Austrian Airlines, Finnair, Icelandair, Lufthansa and SAS.
A profit within Ryanair's guidance would still mark an improvement on the 1.32 billion net profit it recorded for the 
year ended March 2017. That was the third-highest profit, net, among European airline groups for the last financial 
year.
There has been impact on the carrier's share price. This has fallen from a year-high of just over 19 in the middle of 
September to its current price hovering below the 17 level. That, though, is in the context of continued strong 
growth over most of the year. The share price has been climbing from 12 a year ago.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair still among biggest despite capping growth Ryanair 's disclosure that passenger numbers

Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary has also spoken of reputational damage for the carrier. After the biggest publicity hit 
since Ryanair's adoption of its more customer-friendly "Always getting better" campaign, O'Leary responded in 
direct but contrite fashion. "This is a mess of our own making," he said following the first round of cancellations. "I 
apologise sincerely to all our customers for any worry or concern this has caused them."
The flight cancellations also represent the first big setback for Ryanair's overhauled management team. The carrier 
appears to have identified a need for a tighter grip on operations: its chief people officer Michael Hickey has taken 
over the pilot recruitment and rostering function, and the airline has abandoned any interest in bidding for Alitalia, in 
order to "eliminate all management distractions".

Ryanair's disclosure that passenger numbers jumped 10% in September, even amid flight cancellations, underlines 
the extent to which the budget carrier is still growing despite the pilot-rostering challenges that have clipped its 
planned expansion.
The airline has today detailed passengers numbers that, on an earned-seat basis, were up 10% at 11.8 million in 
September – a month which includes more than 2,000 flight cancellations. While below the 12% rise recorded for 
the rolling year to date – and only incorporating two weeks of cancellations – this still illustrates a strong growth 
rate.
Ryanair had initially hoped to confine flight cancellations to six weeks in September and October after the scale of 
an over-allocation of pilot leave became clear. But the airline subsequently opted to ground 25 aircraft over five 
months during the winter and will operate 10 aircraft fewer than planned next summer, in a bid to draw a line under 
the pilot-rostering issue once and for all. The carrier will suspend 34 routes between November and March 2018.
The impact will be a slowing in its capacity growth over the winter months, from 9% to 4%, and the airline now 
expects to carry two million fewer passengers in flying 129 million over the year ending 31 March 2018 – and four 
million fewer in flying 138 million the following year.
But that still represents not only the highest figure of passengers carried by a European airline, but also strong 
growth for the year overall. Ryanair remains in the rapid expansion mode it has been in since ending its fleet-growth 
hiatus with a major follow-on Boeing 737-800 order in 2013.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair still among biggest despite capping growth Ryanair 's disclosure that passenger numbers 
jumped 10% in September, even amid flight cancellation....
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that as of 28 September, Ryanair was set to lift capacity around 11% in terms of 
flights over the five months from November to March compared with the same five-month period in 2016-17. That 
includes a little over 27,000 additional flights. Ryanair says it is cancelling around 18,000 flights, meaning it will still 
operate around 9,000 more flights this winter than in the same period last year.
That would still involve the carrier growing faster, in absolute terms, than most in Europe. And even after the cuts, it 
will still by a distance operate more flights than any other European carrier this winter.
SERVICE INTERRUPTION
Details of the routes impacted show that much of the Irish carrier's UK domestic network will be suspended over the 
winter season as part of efforts to tackle its pilot-rostering issues.
The airline, which only resumed UK domestic operations three years ago, will suspend its London Stansted routes 
from Edinburgh and Glasgow, as well as its Belfast link to London Gatwick. That leaves flights from Derry to 
Liverpool and Glasgow as Ryanair's only UK domestic routes over the winter period.
The UK is one of the most impacted countries in terms of its representation among the 34 routes Ryanair is 
suspending between November and March. Eleven routes covering six UK airports are on the list.
But the biggest country casualty among routes being suspended is Italy. Fourteen services, including seven from 
Trapani, are being put on hold during the winter.
Greece, Poland and Germany are also among the most impacted countries, while the Bulgarian capital Sofia, 
German city Hamburg and Thessaloniki in Greece each have five services being suspended.

The 110,000 passengers stranded by the collapse of Monarch Airlines are unlikely to view it as an educative case 
study. Still, by slumping into administration the UK low-cost carrier has illustrated the problem of loss chasing. This 
is the propensity of investors to throw good money after bad into businesses they have already backed, hoping to 
save their stake.
Greybull Capital put more than £75m into Monarch when it took control in 2014. The turnround specialist made a 
series of other investments, culminating in a £165m equity injection last year. Greybull saw Monarch's future as 
cheap, long-haul travel. It did not have the financial fuel to pursue that flight path properly.
The first problem was that a fall in the pound after the Brexit vote pushed up dollar costs. The second was a drop in 
seat prices for flights to Monarch's short-haul Iberian destinations. Rival airlines increased capacity on these routes 
as travellers shied away from Turkey and north Africa in the wake of terrorist attacks.
Both problems were well known at the time Greybull announced its gutsy decision to pump further equity into 
Monarch a year ago. We must surmise that the investor, which manages the wealth of the Meyohas and Perlhagen 
families, underestimated the scale of both challenges. These have left the company, which notched up a cash 
outflow of £35m in 2016 before investment, with a deficit of about £200m this year. Greybull stands to lose about 
£250m.
The Monarch brand proved less compelling than Greybull had figured. Short-haul European flying is price sensitive 
and dominated by operators such as Ryanair and easyJet. Their superior economies of scale put Monarch at a 
disadvantage.
Monarch Airlines : flying on vapour Twitter : @FTLex Email: lex@ft.com
Greybull may suffer reflexive criticism as the Monarch blame game begins. The owner's real fault was to over 
commit. Interest on about £145m in shareholder loans was rolled up for later payment, for example.
The collapse is uncomfortably timed for the UK's ruling Conservative party. This week it is attempting to defend 
capitalism from Labour party attacks. Monarch's woes show markets remain adept at weeding out weak businesses 
and redeploying their assets to stronger ones. But you should not expect to hear that line in the Tory conference 
hall, any more than chat about loss chasing in airport lounges.

The aviation industry has never been guaranteed plain sailing (or flying), but it is hard to remember a time when its 
failures have been so prevalent in Britain's news agenda. With millions facing airport delays and an epidemic of 
cancelled flights, it is clear that the traditional commercial aviation model is broken.
In the space of a fortnight, Ryanair's widespread cancellation of flights has pushed their competitors, including 
EasyJet, Cityjet and Jet2, to their operating limits in order to accommodate stranded passengers.
With Ryanair accused of imposing unreasonable price restrictions on rerouting flights, the Commercial Aviation 
Authority (CAA) has been forced to intervene. Passengers have been left marooned - and understandably 
indignant.
Ryanair's very public and very significant misstep has been swiftly followed by the death of one of the UK's most 
famous airlines, Monarch. A failing business is never good news, but in aviation the consequences are immediate 
and painful.
Monarch's collapse has left more than 100,000 customers stranded overseas and all future flights from the UK 
cancelled. With holidays ruined, meetings postponed, and travel plans in tatters, once again the CAA must step in 
with emergency measures to ease what is already a crisis for the industry.
Monarch, helped to its demise by the falling pound, is not unique in its failure - nor is this trend confined to the UK. 
Just over a month ago, Air Berlin joined the list of doomed airlines.
It's time airlines did some blue sky thinking
So what caused this change in course for what has traditionally been seen as a glamorous and cashrich industry? 
First there's the rise of low cost airlines. Instead of prompting more established carriers to innovate and improve 
their services, the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet are dragging down their competitors at both ends of the industry.
Holidaymaker airlines like Monarch became embroiled in a race to the bottom on price, while at the top end, 
commercial business travellers no longer get what they pay for when it comes to service.
In addition, traditional air travel generally doesn't fit with our modern way of life. With Uber, Netflix and Deliveroo 
used by millions, we've become accustomed to having what we want when we want it. Airlines expect us to arrive 
two hours before a flight, only to endure several lengthy queues before departure.
What passengers really need is a genuine alternative, not just a bit of extra legroom. Consumers expect flexibility, 
convenience and the personal touch - all of which are currently under-serviced by traditional commercial airlines. 
They should be treated like people being given an experience, not simply numbers on a seat manifest.
With the recent troubles for Monarch and Ryanair, coupled with world-class innovators such as Elon Musk 
promising to transform the whole concept of travel, airlines should be under no illusions - now is the time to change 
or die.
There will always be a need for air travel, but as we have seen in industries such as public transportation, there is 
room for innovative and disruptive companies to reinvent and improve the sector beyond recognition.
The current chaos within the aviation industry, of which Monarch is a victim, leaves the door open for new players to 
enter the market. As with other industries, the value of time, achieved by shorter queuing times in the airport, 
personalised service, choice, and adaptability will go a long way for the regular flyer.
Technology offers more opportunities to streamline travel, meaning traditional airlines must redefine their USP to 
find their markets, sharpen their focus, and improve their offerings - or face being grounded for good.

Ryanair rebounded from a five-month low yesterday, helped by speculation of a tie-up with Airbnb.
Ryanair and peers were in demand after the failure of Monarch Airlines raised hopes of capacity cuts and improved 
pricing power.
The loss of Alitalia, Air Berlin and Monarch flights, along with Ryanair's own cancellations, mean European short-
haul capacity growth for winter could be just 3.2 per cent rather than the 7.3 per cent expected a week ago, HSBC 
estimated.
Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch analysts saw "a high likelihood" that Ryanair would soon agree a cross-selling deal with 
Airbnb as a means to drive booking volumes and "capture a lucrative part of the value chain".
Merrill put a (EURO)20 target on Ryanair, which closed 3.9 per cent higher at (EURO)16.90.
"It is hard to paint a scenario where Ryanair loses the market share war we expect to see in the coming years," 
Merrill said.
EasyJet was top performer in the FTSE 100, up 5.2 per cent to £12.80, while Wizz Air was up 4.6 per cent to £30 
and IAG, the British Airways owner, rose 2.4 per cent to 607.5p.
The FTSE 100 was up 0.9 per cent, ahead 66.08 points to 7,438.84.
London Ryanair rebounds on talk of tie-up with Airbnb
Housebuilders jumped in response to a pledge from the prime minister Theresa May to allocate a further £10bn to 
keep the Help To Buy mortgage subsidy scheme running beyond 2021.
Persimmon rose 4.2 per cent to £26.90 and Barratt Developments added 4.2 per cent to 640.5p.
Nex Group, the market maker formerly known as ICAP, dropped 5.6 per cent to 625p on a warning that margins 
were being held back by increased investment costs and low volatility.
Sandwich maker Greencore was 7.2 per cent lower at 182p, a four-year low, after US regulators found listeria in 
deliveries to its Rhode Island factory.
Greencore said it had voluntarily recalled about three days of production as a precautionary measure.
Numis estimated $300,000 in lost sales for Greencore's US business, against revenue for the division of £913m this 
year.
The stock's sharp drop may reflect "concerns over Greencore's ability to win new business to fill its legacy sites", 
Numis said.
Aggreko, the generator hire specialist, lost 5.5 per cent to 887.5p after Berenberg downgraded to "sell" with a 770p 
target price.
Berenberg said that consensus forecasts are "far too optimistic" for Aggreko's emerging markets-focused utility 
business, where pricing remains tough and the company "needs to see a significant increase in contract wins just to 
stand still".

Monarch has teetered on the brink of collapse several times before. But this time the UK budget airline that filed for 
administration in the early hours of yesterday failed to find a saviour.
The British carrier and tour operator finally ran out of options and money to turn round its business, becoming the 
latest victim of a cut-throat European short-haul market.
Like its peers, Air Berlin and Alitalia, which both entered administration this summer, Monarch has been unable to 
compete in Europe, coming up against much larger airlines with much lower cost bases.
Low fuel prices have encouraged stronger rivals to flood the market with capacity, putting pressure on weaker 
operators.
"Monarch had somewhat lost its way in recent years, trying to reinvent itself as a low-cost carrier but in a market 
already well supplied by dominant players like Ryanair and easyJet," says John Strickland, an aviation consultant.
The airline, which was founded in 1968 by the Swiss-Italian Mantegazza family as package holidays boomed, had 
been a profitable business for the large part of its early history, until charter flying started to decline amid 
Monarch brought down by a brutal market Carrier discovered it could not compete in Europe as it came up 
against larger-scale rivals with much lower cost bases
competition from low-cost carriers and the increasing ease of assembling holidays online. But in the past five years, 
Monarch, the UK's fifth-largest airline, has struggled to navigate a successful path.
In the past three years alone, it has been saved from collapse twice with emergency cash injections from London-
based investment group Greybull Capital, which bought the airline in 2014 two hours away from insolvency. In total 
Greybull, which has also acquired and revived Tata Steel's Scunthorpe plant in eastern England, has ploughed 
funds into Monarch on nine separate occasions. Before that the Mantegazza family had invested £115m into 
refinancing the airline.
Under Greybull's ownership, Monarch ditched its longstanding business model as a charter airline and repositioned 
itself as a budget carrier that would compete with easyJet and Ryanair for holidaymakers. It cut about 700 jobs, 
reduced its fleet and scrapped long-haul flights, helping to cut £200m in annual costs. It also struck a deal with the 
Pension Protection Fund (PPF), through which the lifeboat took a 10 per cent stake in the business and assumed 
responsibility for the £158m pension scheme deficit.
While the restructuring brought some initial success - alongside cheap fuel prices and a weak euro, it helped 
Monarch deliver its first profit in three years in 2015 - this was shortlived.
Recently, the group has suffered from the impact of terrorist attacks in Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia, which hit tourism 
in those countries, resulting in more airlines putting on flights from Britain to Spain, Monarch's largest destination.
Meanwhile, a weaker pound since the UK's vote to leave the EU added costs. Almost all of Monarch's airline 
revenues were in sterling, but it had significant costs in both US dollars and other European currencies.
In October 2016, Greybull injected £165m to help the airline retain its flying licence, as chief executive Andrew 
Swaffield warned of a "challenging market".
Mr Swaffield said that this money - the biggest investment in the company's history - would enable it to "really 
approach the future with great confidence".
Since then the market has grown tougher, with people close to Greybull arguing they were at the receiving end of 
"massive external pressures", including a drop in the value of the pound and a sharp fall in revenues as ticket prices 
dropped due to rising competition.
In the year to October 2016, Monarch reported a statutory loss of £291m, compared with a profit of £27m in 2015.
The company told staff yesterday that this year it was carrying 14 per cent more passengers than last year for 
£100m less revenue.
Data from OAG, an aviation consultancy, shows how the airline has had to move about 213,000 seats from Egypt 
into other, more competitive, markets, such as Spain and Portugal, taking it head-to-head with the big low-cost 
carriers.
John Grant, a consultant, says "Egypt and to a lesser degree Turkey provided Monarch with some degree of 
protection" as journey times were too long for the more aggressive low-cost carriers.
In its annual report, published in July, Monarch said it was once again reviewing its strategy, with a plan to move 
away from the short-haul market and return to its old long-haul business model. The group had looked into selling 
its short-haul business but received "no deliverable offer".
On Saturday, the Civil Aviation Authority gave the group just 24 hours to raise fresh funds - and Greybull was 
unable to secure a deal in time. One airline industry source close to the discussions says it became evident that 
Monarch had "more liabilities than it had assets". Greybull stands to lose about £250m in both equity and debt as a 
result of the airline's failure. "It's close to a total write-off," one person briefed on the process says.
Monarch brought down by a brutal market Carrier discovered it could not compete in Europe as it came up 
against larger-scale rivals with much lower cost bases
"The thing about the airline industry is that airlines that are widely considered to be financially doomed have been 
kept alive for years and years if someone is able or willing to inject capital," says Gerald Khoo, an analyst at 
Liberum. "Both Alitalia and Air Berlin fell into that category too."
Some commentators say Monarch's failure highlights that there is no place for a "mid-market" carrier that is not 
protected by either some geographic or operational quirk. "Monarch, Air Berlin, Alitalia and others fall into that 
space, and over time, the inevitable happens," says Mr Grant.
For its administrators, KPMG, Monarch's lucrative Gatwick slots will be vital to recovering any money. Meanwhile, 
Monarch's rivals are likely to welcome any reduction of capacity from the competitive European short-haul market.
According to analysts at HSBC, a week ago that sector was expected to grow by 7.3 per cent this winter. Taking out 
capacity from Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia, as well as the recent Ryanair cancellations "lowers the market growth 
to 3.2 per cent", wrote Andrew Lobbenberg at HSBC.

Monarch has teetered on the brink of collapse several times before. But this time the UK budget airline that filed for 
administration in the early hours of yesterday failed to find a saviour.
The British carrier and tour operator finally ran out of options and money to turn round its business, becoming the 
latest victim of a cut-throat European short-haul market.
Like its peers, Air Berlin and Alitalia, which both entered administration this summer, Monarch has been unable to 
compete in Europe, coming up against much larger airlines with much lower cost bases. Low fuel prices have 
encouraged stronger rivals to flood the market with capacity, putting pressure on weaker operators.
"Monarch had somewhat lost its way in recent years, trying to reinvent itself as a low-cost carrier but in a market 
already well supplied by dominant players like Ryanair and easyJet," says John Strickland, an aviation consultant.
The airline, founded in 1968 by the Swiss-Italian Mantegazza family as package holidays boomed, had been a 
profitable business for the large part of its early history, until charter flying started to decline amid competition from 
low-cost carriers and the increasing ease of assembling holidays online. But in the past five years, Monarch, the 
UK's fifth-largest airline, has struggled to navigate a successful path.
Monarch brought down by a brutal market Carrier discovered it could not compete in Europe as it came up 
against larger-scale rivals with much lower cost bases
In the past three years alone, it has been saved from collapse twice with emergency cash injections from London-
based investment group Greybull Capital, which bought the airline in 2014 two hours away from insolvency. In total 
Greybull, which has also acquired and revived Tata Steel's Scunthorpe plant in eastern England, has ploughed 
funds into Monarch on nine separate occasions. Before that the Mantegazza family had invested £115m into 
refinancing the airline.
Under Greybull's ownership, Monarch ditched its longstanding business model as a charter airline and repositioned 
itself as a budget carrier that would compete with easyJet and Ryanair for holidaymakers. It cut about 700 jobs, 
reduced its fleet and scrapped long-haul flights, helping to cut £200m in annual costs. It also struck a deal with the 
Pension Protection Fund (PPF), through which the lifeboat took a 10 per cent stake in the business and assumed 
responsibility for the £158m pension scheme deficit.
While the restructuring brought some initial success - alongside cheap fuel prices and a weak euro, it helped 
Monarch deliver its first profit in three years in 2015 - this was shortlived.
Recently, the group has suffered from the impact of terrorist attacks in Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia, which hit tourism 
in those countries, resulting in more airlines putting on flights from Britain to Spain, Monarch's largest destination.
Meanwhile, a weaker pound since the UK's vote to leave the EU added costs. Almost all of Monarch's airline 
revenues were in sterling, but it had significant costs in both US dollars and other European currencies.
In October 2016, Greybull injected £165m to help the airline retain its flying licence, as chief executive Andrew 
Swaffield warned of a "challenging market". Mr Swaffield said that this money - the biggest investment in the 
company's history - would enable it to "really approach the future with great confidence".
Since then the market has grown tougher, with people close to Greybull arguing they were at the receiving end of 
"massive external pressures", including a drop in the value of the pound and a sharp fall in revenues as ticket prices 
dropped due to rising competition.
In the year to October 2016, Monarch reported a statutory loss of £291m, compared with a profit of £27m in 2015.
The company told staff yesterday that this year it was carrying 14 per cent more passengers than last year for 
£100m less revenue.
Data from OAG, an aviation consultancy, shows how the airline has had to move about 213,000 seats from Egypt 
into other, more competitive, markets, such as Spain and Portugal, taking it head-to-head with the big low-cost 
carriers.
John Grant, a consultant, says "Egypt and to a lesser degree Turkey provided Monarch with some degree of 
protection" as journey times were too long for the more aggressive low-cost carriers.
In its annual report, published in July, Monarch said it was once again reviewing its strategy, with a plan to move 
away from the short-haul market and return to its old long-haul business model. The group had looked into selling 
its short-haul business but received "no deliverable offer".
On Saturday, the Civil Aviation Authority gave the group just 24 hours to raise fresh funds - and Greybull was 
unable to secure a deal in time. One airline industry source close to the discussions says it became evident that 
Monarch had "more liabilities than it had assets". Greybull stands to lose about £250m in both equity and debt as a 
result of the airline's failure. "It's close to a total write-off," one person briefed on the process says.
"The thing about the airline industry is that airlines that are widely considered to be financially doomed have been 
kept alive for years and years if someone is able or willing to inject capital," says Gerald Khoo, an analyst at 
Liberum. "Both Alitalia and Air Berlin fell into that category too."
Monarch brought down by a brutal market Carrier discovered it could not compete in Europe as it came up 
against larger-scale rivals with much lower cost bases
Some commentators say Monarch's failure highlights that there is no place for a "mid-market" carrier that is not 
protected by either some geographic or operational quirk. "Monarch, Air Berlin, Alitalia and others fall into that 
space, and over time, the inevitable happens," says Mr Grant.
For its administrators, KPMG, Monarch's lucrative Gatwick slots will be vital to recovering any money. Meanwhile, 
Monarch's rivals are likely to welcome any reduction of capacity from the competitive European short-haul market.
According to analysts at HSBC, a week ago that sector was expected to grow by 7.3 per cent this winter. Taking out 
capacity from Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia, as well as the recent Ryanair cancellations "lowers the market growth 
to 3.2 per cent", wrote Andrew Lobbenberg at HSBC.
For other short-haul airlines, this will mean less competition in the short term, bolstering yields.
For Monarch, it is too late. "Monarch was basically in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was sub-scale and failed 
to adapt to changes in a tough market," says Mr Khoo.

THE UK'S top share index rose to a four-week high yesterday as homebuilders rallied thanks to an extension of a 
government housing scheme, while airlines and miners also gained.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ended up 0.9 per cent at 7,438.84 points, helped by a fall in sterling.
Housebuilders Persimmon, Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey were among the biggest gainers, jumping 
two per cent to 4.2 per cent after UK Prime Minister Theresa May pledged £10bn of extra funding to help people 
buy new homes.
Persimmon also hit a record high.
"That's a clear positive, and I think (the extension) should actually benefit, more so, the more diversified builders," 
Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.
"To the extent that we could get something which resembles anything like a soft Brexit, this would forestall much of 
the feared impact on the sector," Odeluga added.
Housing-related stocks were hit particularly hard by uncertainty fol-lowing the Brexit vote in 2016, as the sector is 
closely linked to the state of the UK economy.
Many of those stocks have since recouped those losses.
Elsewhere budget airline Easyjet jumped 5.2 per cent after peer Monarch Airlines went bust.
This spurred a rally across European carriers on the prospect of scooping up bookings from customers switching 
airlines. Shares in British Airways operator IAG also rose 2.4 per cent.

"(Monarch's failure) means fewer seats to fill sector-wide ... This should mean Ryanair and Easyjet can comfortably 
improve load factors, even if the reputation of the former has suffered of late," ETX Capital's Neil Wilson, said in a 
note.
A rise among mining stocks also helped the index, with shares in Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American all rising 
more than one per cent thanks to a buoyant copper price.

MONARCH collapsed into administration yesterday, affecting the journeys of 860,000 passengers in the largest UK 
airline failure in history.
The failure of the Luton-based company led to transport secretary Chris Grayling ordering the "country's biggest 
ever peacetime repatriation" to fly back 110,000 passengers stranded abroad.
The rescue operation will cost around £60m, the Civil Aviation Authority confirmed last night.
The collapsed carrier, which turned 50 in March, was placed into administration at 4am yesterday morning with all 
of Monarch's 750,000 future bookings effectively cancelled. Administrators KPMG confirmed last night that 1,858 
employees at Monarch Airlines and Monarch Travel Group have been made redundant.
Eleventh-hour talks failed to save Monarch, which was under extreme financial stress due to factors including global 
terrorism, the weaker pound and intense competition from low-cost rivals on leisure routes.
The airline reported a loss of £291m for the year to October 2016.

"I am so sorry that thousands now face a cancelled holiday or trip, possible delays getting home and huge 
inconvenience as a result of our failure," Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield told employees.
Greybull Capital, which acquired the business in 2014, said it was "deeply saddened" by the failure of Britain's fifth-
largest airline.
The fund manager is unlikely to recoup around £250m of debt and equity it has invested over the last three years.
Shares in Monarch's rivals jumped yesterday with UK-listed airlines seeing around half a billion pounds added to 
their combined stock market valuations.
Easyjet and Wizz Air were among the biggest gainers, with the airlines' shares closing up 5.18 per cent and 4.86 
per cent respectively.
Easyjet also announced its "largest recruitment drive" yesterday to take on Monarch's employees including cabin 
crew, pilots and head office staff.
Tina Milton, head of cabin services for Easyjet, said: "We will be holding recruitment days for Monarch cabin crew 
both in Luton and Gatwick this week with 500 positions still available."
Cantor Fitzgerald's Robin Byde said some of Monarch's assets were a "good potential fit" for Easyjet and the firm is 
"likely" to try and pick them up from the administrators.
"The pilots are also likely to be in demand," added Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo.
"Although Monarch's all-Airbus fleet means that they would not be available to relieve Ryanair's shortage."
Ryanair operates an all-Boeing fleet. Meanwhile, Grayling said Monarch's failure does not mean the wider aviation 
sector is in trouble.
"Let nobody think this is a sign of general problems in our aviation sector," the transport secretary said in a speech 
yesterday.

The government launched Britain's "biggest ever peacetime repatriation" as it began flying home the first of 110,000 
holidaymakers stranded overseas after the collapse of Monarch Airlines, the country's fifth-biggest airline.
Administrators from KPMG were appointed in the early hours of yesterday after the low-cost carrier and tour 
operator held emergency talks at the weekend with regulators over Monarch's future. All of its 750,000 future 
bookings have been cancelled.
The collapse of Monarch is the third failure of a European airline in six months. Both Air Berlin and Alitalia went into 
insolvency proceedings this summer, after intense competition in the European short-haul market has put 
increasing pressure on weaker carriers.
The private equity owners of Monarch Airlines held last-minute talks with several airlines, including easyJet and 
British Airways owner IAG, as part of a long-running effort to prevent its collapse. On Saturday, the UK aviation 
regulator gave the airline just 24 hours to raise fresh funds but Greybull Capital, which owns the majority of 
Monarch, was unable to secure a deal in time.
Monarch Airlines collapse spurs 'biggest peacetime repatriation' 3? 30 aircraft chartered to rescue 110,000 
tourists ? Europe's third airline to fail in 6 month....
The Civil Aviation Authority will charter more than 30 aircraft to bring Monarch Airlines customers back to the UK in 
what Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, described as the "biggest ever peacetime repatriation".
Andrew Swaffield, Monarch's chief executive, said: "Since 2015 we've seen yields collapse by a quarter, resulting in 
£160m less revenue ... The root cause is the closure, due to terrorism, of Sharm el-Sheikh and Tunisia and the 
decimation of Turkey."
Monarch's owners had "extensive conversations" with several airlines throughout the summer months. "They called 
anyone who could be interested but talks came to nothing," said a person with direct knowledge of the plans. 
Greybull stands to lose about £250m in both equity and debt as the result of Monarch's going into administration.
Monarch flew to about 40 destinations from five UK airports. KPMG said 1,858 employees would lose their jobs. Its 
largest market was Spain, which had become fiercely competitive as its rivals organised more flights and holidays 
there as tourists turned away from the eastern Mediterranean when the European migrant crisis worsened last year. 
The largest number of stranded passengers were in the Costa del Sol, Andrew Haines, the CAA chief, said.
"This has been part of the issue with Monarch," he explained. "With terrorism in the Middle East and [issues in] the 
eastern Med, they've been part of a very intense price war in a very congested market in the western Med." 
Monarch's collapse followed severe disruption for customers of its bigger budget airline rival, Ryanair, which 
cancelled more than 2,000 flights last month after pilot-scheduling problems. Lex page 14 Analysis page 17

Shares in budget carriers EasyJet and Ryanair spiked upwards following the demise of UK leisure operator 
Monarch Airlines.
Both carriers' stock prices rose by around 5% on 2 October as Monarch entered administration.
Monarch had been competing with the operators on the short-haul market in Europe. The carrier had attributed its 
collapse partly to overcapacity on key routes.
Shares in British Airways parent, IAG, which also has a strong European short-haul network – including that served 
by Spanish budget operator Vueling – rose by around 2.2%.

 European stocks were higher on Monday morning, with the exception of Spain's benchmark index, as an 
independence referendum held in the region of Catalonia on Sunday, which was deemed illegal by the country's 
constitutional court, turned violent at some polling stations and the euro weakened, which is advantageous for the 
euro area's exporters. 
Less than half of the people registered on Catalonia's electoral poll turned out to vote in the referendum, with the 
result showing a majority in favor of secession. Voter turnout was 42% with 90% of ballots cast in favor of 
independence from Spain, according to data published by the Generalitat, the Catalan government. The vote was 
marred by widely-circulated images, videos and reports on social media appearing to show police using batons and 
rubber bullets on civilians. Carles Puigdemont, president of the Catalan government, is expected to make a 
statement on whether Catalonia will be declared independent within the next two days.
"Events over the weekend could present a problem for EU leaders who may come under pressure in some quarters 
to start procedures to invoke article 7 of the EU treaties, on one of its largest members," Michael Hewson, chief 
market analyst at CMC Markets in London said by e-mail. "The article guarantees the EU's fundamental values 
which are defined as "liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. 
If the EU does nothing in response to the violent events of the weekend they run the risk of being accused of double 
standards." 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.2%, led by travel and leisure and the food and drinks sectors, while 
banks and utilities were in the red. 
Travel and leisure stocks benefited as Monarch Airlines ceased trading overnight and its 300,000 future bookings 
for flights and holidays were cancelled, the BBC reported citing the Civil Aviation Authority. Low-cost airline EasyJet 
gained 3.9% in London and Ryanair added 2.2% in Dublin. German aviation major Lufthansa rose 2.4% in 
Frankfurt. 
European Stocks Rise as Euro Advances Following Unrest During Catalonia Referendum
British housebuilders soared after UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday pledged an extra 10 billion pounds

 European markets were mostly higher on Monday even as Spanish stocks fell amid a political crisis after Catalans 
voted in favor of independence in a contested referendum, plunging the EU into a new crisis.
The euro moved lower against the dollar after the violence-marred independence vote in Spain's Catalonia region.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.3% at 389.27 in late opening deals, with upbeat data from 
China, Japan and the euro zone supporting underlying sentiment.
Official data released over the weekend showed activity in China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest 
pace since 2012 in September, helping ease growth worries ahead of an upcoming political meeting next month.
Separately, Tankan survey results showed that Japanese business confidence among large manufacturers 
improved in the third quarter to the highest in a decade.
Closer home, final data from IHS Markit showed today that the euro area manufacturing sector grew the most in 
over six-and-a-half years in September.
The final manufacturing PMI climbed to a 79-month high of 58.1 from 57.4 in August, suggesting expansion for the 
fifty-first month in a row.
Investors shrugged off data from IHS Markit, which showed that the UK manufacturing sector continued to expand 
in September, albeit at a slower pace compared to August.
The German DAX was up 0.3% and France's CAC 40 was marginally higher, while the UK's FTSE 100 was up as 
much as 0.6%, led by housebuilders and airline stocks. Spain's IBEX was tumbling 1.4%, dragged down by banks 
with CaixaBank and Sabadell losing 4-6%.
Miners Antofagasta, Anglo American, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto gained 1-2% as copper futures edged

 Rivals have begun circling the carcass of collapsed airline Monarch in the hope of bagging its landing slots as the 
firm's administrator prepares to carve up its assets.
The likes of easyJet PLC, Wizz Air Holdings PLC, Norwegian Air Shuttle and British Airways-owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group SA are understood to be mulling moves for the carrier's slots, which span Manchester, 
Gatwick, Birmingham, Luton and Leeds-Bradford airports, according to people familiar with the matter.
It comes after Monarch's private equity owner Greybull called in administrators to the firm in the early hours of 
Monday morning.
Greybull cited a highly competitive market, terrorism and the collapse in the value of the pound as factors 
contributing to Monarch's demise.
Around 860,000 customers are affected by Monarch Airlines going into administration, the Civil Aviation Authority 
has said.
This includes 110,000 who are currently abroad and 750,000 with future bookings.
The Luton-based carrier, which was about to mark its 50th anniversary, went into administration early on Monday, 
triggering uncertainty for customers and a huge effort to get people already on holiday back to the UK.
The CAA said it had been asked by the government to charter more than 30 aircraft to bring the passengers home, 
with UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling calling it the "biggest peacetime repatriation" effort.
A sale of the group is not thought to be on the cards and it is likely that parts of the carrier, including its take-off and 
landing slots, fleet of aircraft and buildings, will be sold off piecemeal.
The entire process is expected to take between four to six weeks and it also means that the bulk of Monarch's 
2,100 staff are likely to face redundancy.
TOP NEWS: Airline Rivals Circle Monarch To Grab Landing Slots, Pilots
The collapse of the Luton-based airline, which was about to mark its 50th anniversary, has triggered uncertainty for 
customers and a huge effort to get people already on holiday back to the UK.
Robin Byde, transport analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said that Monarch's assets would be attractive to easyJet in 
particular.
"Monarch assets may enable easyJet to increase frequencies on common routes, gain more attractive year-round 
and seasonal slots, and generally take market share.
"On fleets, synergies could be attractive as Monarch currently operates 34 Airbus A320-family aircraft which are 
compatible with easyJet's fleet," he said.
However, Byde added that British competition authorities and the Civil Aviation Authority would scrutinise any deal 
closely.
Monarch's pilots are also expected to be sought after, but it is unlikely that Ryanair, which has been forced to 
cancel flights in recent weeks after miscalculating pilot leave, will be able to snap them up easily.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, said: "The pilots are also likely to be in demand, although Monarch's all-Airbus 
fleet means that they would not be available to relieve Ryanair's shortage (Ryanair operates an all-Boeing fleet)," 
referring to Ryanair Holdings PLC.
Commercial airline pilots require a "type rating" to fly a certain model of aircraft and, while they can hold more than 
one of these ratings at a time, it is unclear how many Monarch pilots hold the permission to fly Ryanair's fleet.

 The European markets ended the first day of the new trading week in the green, extending their recent winning 
streak to eight straight sessions. Investors were encouraged by official data released over the weekend which 
showed activity in China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace since 2012 in September.
The weakening of the Euro against the US dollar also provided a boost to the markets Monday. The currency 
dipped after Catalans voted in favor of independence in a contested referendum. In the weekend referendum, the 
Catalonian's voted to leave Spain. The weekend vote also turned violent, leaving over 800 people injured after 
clashes with police.
Euro area's economic recovery has been solid, broad-based and resilient, yet inflationary pressures remain 
subdued, European Central Bank Executive Board member Peter Praet said Monday.
"While we remain confident that inflation developments will eventually return to levels below, but close to, 2% our 
medium-term objective, the evidence still shows insufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of 
inflation towards those levels," Praet, who is also the ECB's chief economist, said in a speech in London.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.37%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.22%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 0.42%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.58% and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.39%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 
0.90% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.92%.
Airline stocks rallied on the news that Monarch Airlines has been placed into administration. Lufthansa climbed 
3.45% in Frankfurt, while easyJet rose 4.93% and Ryanair Holdings jumped 3.50% in London.
In Paris, ballpoint pen and razor maker BIC plunged 9.86% after cutting its 2017 sales forecast.
In London, CRH lost 0.92% on a Bloomberg report that it is nearing an agreement to acquire Florida-based cement 
company Suwannee American Cement LLC from Votorantim Cimentos SA and Anderson Columbia Co.

Daily Mail and General Trust declined 2.08%. The newspaper publisher expects its full-year pretax profit to be at 
the lower end of market expectations.
Barratt Developments advanced 4.23% on expectations that the government will extend the 'Help to Buy' scheme to 
stimulate the demand side of the housing market.
The euro area unemployment rate remained stable in August at the lowest level seen since early 2009, data from 
Eurostat showed Monday.
The jobless rate came in at 9.1% in August, the same rate as seen in July. This was the lowest rate since February 
2009. The rate was forecast to drop to 9%.
The euro area manufacturing sector grew the most in over six-and-a-half years in September, final data from IHS 
Markit showed Monday. The final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to a 79-month high of 58.1 in 
September from 57.4 in August. The flash score was 58.2.
The UK manufacturing sector continued to expand in September, albeit at a slower pace compared to August, data 
from IHS Markit showed Monday.
The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply factory Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-
expected to 55.9 in September from a 4-month high of 56.7 in August. The expected score was 56.2.
UK private sector growth slowed in three months to September, according to growth indicator released by the 
Confederation of British Industry. The balance of firms reporting an increase in output fell to +11% from +14% in 
three months to August.
Activity in the US manufacturing sector unexpectedly grew at a faster rate in the month of September, according to 
a report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Monday.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index climbed to 60.8 in September from 58.8 in August, with a reading 
above 50 indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had expected the index to dip to 50.8.
A report released by the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending in the US increased by 
more than expected in the month of August.
The Commerce Department said construction spending climbed 0.5% to USD1.218 trillion in August after plunging 
by 1.2% to USD1.212 trillion in July. Economists had expected spending to rise by 0.2%.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Shares of easyJet Plc (ESYJY.PK, EZJ.L) and Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L) were 
gaining in the morning trading in London after domestic rival Monarch Airlines had been placed into administration. 
Monarch's all further flights from the UK had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled, accountants KPMG 
announced Monday. 
 The Civil Aviation Authority said it had launched a program to bring 110,000 customers back home over the next 
fortnight, chartering 30 planes for the rescue operation.  According to the regulator, all Monarch customers who are 
abroad and due to return to the UK in the next two weeks will be flown home at no extra cost. But the airline's 
300,000 future bookings had been cancelled.  The CAA chief executive, Andrew Haines, reportedly said, 'We know 
that Monarch's decision to stop trading will be very distressing for all of its customers and employees. This is the 
biggest UK airline ever to cease trading, so the government has asked the CAA to support Monarch customers 
currently abroad to get back to the UK at the end of their holiday at no extra cost to them.'  Monarch was Britain's 
longest-surviving airline that offered scheduled, low-fare service. With a fleet of 30 Boeing and Airbus aircraft, the 
carrier served some 6.5 million passengers per year, primarily through agreements with tour operators.  EasyJet 
shares were gaining around 3.53 percent to 1,260 pence.  Ryanair shares were gaining 2.6 percent to 16.70 euros.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European markets were mostly higher on Monday even as 
Spanish stocks fell amid a political crisis after Catalans voted in favor of independence in a contested referendum, 
plunging the EU into a new crisis.  The euro moved lower against the dollar after the violence-marred independence 
vote in Spain's Catalonia region.  The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.3 percent at 389.27 in late 
opening deals, with upbeat data from China, Japan and the euro zone supporting underlying sentiment. 
 Official data released over the weekend showed activity in China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest 
pace since 2012 in September, helping ease growth worries ahead of an upcoming political meeting next month.  
Separately, Tankan survey results showed that Japanese business confidence among large manufacturers 
improved in the third quarter to the highest in a decade.  Closer home, final data from IHS Markit showed today that 
the euro area manufacturing sector grew the most in over six-and-a-half years in September.  The final 
manufacturing PMI climbed to a 79-month high of 58.1 from 57.4 in August, suggesting expansion for the fifty-first 
month in a row.  Investors shrugged off data from IHS Markit, which showed that the U.K. manufacturing sector 
continued to expand in September, albeit at a slower pace compared to August.  The German DAX was up 0.3 
percent and France's CAC 40 was marginally higher, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up as much as 0.6 percent, 
led by housebuilders and airline stocks.  Spain's IBEX was tumbling 1.4 percent, dragged down by banks with 
CaixaBank and Sabadell losing 4-6 percent.   Miners Antofagasta, Anglo American, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio 
Tinto gained 1-2 percent as copper futures edged up after upbeat economic data from China and Japan.  Shares of

UK regulators are chartering over 30 aircraft to repatriate passengers following the collapse of Monarch Airlines.
The Civil Aviation Authority says the cessation of operations by Monarch is the "largest ever" entry into 
administration by a UK carrier.
Administrators of the airline have confirmed that 1,760 personnel at the carrier have been made redundant, along 
with another 98 employed by Monarch Travel Group.
The two companies had some 2,100 staff between them, and the remaining 250 or so will be assisting with the 
administration process and supporting the CAA's efforts to return the 110,000 customers still abroad.
"Regrettably, with the business no longer able to fly, a significant number of redundancies were made," says KPMG 
partner Blair Nimmo, who is overseeing the administration.
Around 300,000 future bookings have been cancelled as a result of Monarch's collapse.
"Everyone due to fly in the next [two weeks] will be brought back to the UK at no cost to them," says the CAA. The 
aircraft drafted to repatriate passengers will operate to over 30 airports, it adds.
Rival carriers are already stepping in to pick up ex-Monarch personnel, with EasyJet recruiting for 500 cabin crew at 
London Luton and London Gatwick, as well as aircraft captains.
EasyJet, like Monarch, operates Airbus A320-family jets.
While Ryanair has been struggling to overcome a crew shortfall which has forced mass cancellations of flights, the 
airline exclusively uses Boeing 737-800s – which means any pilots switching to the carrier would need to undergo 
conversion training.

Airlines and house builders drive FTSE higher

Highlight: Airline stocks jump after collapse of Monarch, while house builders receive boost from government's 
extension of Help to Buy scheme.
Body
Airline stocks have led the FTSE 100 higher following the collapse of rival Monarch, the biggest ever failure of a 
British airline.
Easyjet (EZJ) was among the biggest risers,  up 3.5% at &pound;12.60, helping the UK blue-chip index rise 33 
points, or 0.4%, to 7,405.
Monarch cancelled around 300,000 future booking as it fell into administration, leaving tens of thousands of 
travellers stranded overseas.
Investors sent shares of its former rivals higher, on the prospect of  capacity being removed from the market.
British Airways owner International Airlines Group (ICAG) was up 1.7% at 190.2p while travel group TUI (TUIT) 
rose 1.6% to &pound;12.88. On the FTSE 250, Wizz Air (WIZZ) jumped 3.1% to &pound;29.49 and Thomas Cook 
(TCG) was up 2.8% at 123.7p.
'Capacity being taken out of the market was always going to be good news for other airline stocks, with EasyJet, 
Ryanair and TUI all enjoying a bounce this morning, but the collapse of Monarch does highlight serious issues for 
the airline industry,' said Rebecca O'Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor.
'Less competition is good news for the airline share prices in the short term, but if these Monarch assets are simply 
repatriated to other carriers, the drop in capacity may not persist for long.'
The FTSE 100 also received a boost from house builders, after the government pledged an extra &pound;10 billion 
for the Help to Buy scheme.
Persimmon (PSN) jumped 3.4% to &pound;26.68, Barratt Developments (BDEV) was up 3.3% at 635p and 
Taylor Wimpey (TW) rose 1.8% to 199p.
On the FTSE 250, Crest Nicholson (CRST) rose 2.5% to 567p, Bellway (BWY) was up 2.4% at &pound;33.76 and 
Redrow (RDW) added 2% to 604.5p.
Airlines and house builders drive FTSE higher
Among 'small cap' stocks, MJ Gleeson (GLEG) was up 3.7% at 682p.
Numis analyst Chris Millington said news was 'highly significant and should underpin new build housing demand by 
a further four years through to 2025'.
'The scheme is material for the quoted UK house building sector (and associated companies) with roughly 40% of 
private completions using the scheme. The biggest user of the scheme under our coverage is Persimmon (54% of 
private completions) and Berkeley is the smallest user.'
The biggest fallers were found outside the FTSE 100. Among 'mid-cap' stocks, NEX Group (NXGN) fell 7.9% to 
610p after the financial trading technology company issued a profit warning.
Among 'small-cap' stocks, shares in Carillion (CLLN) continued to slide, down 7.3% at 47.5p, after the outsourcing 
group's profit warning on Friday.

Aviation, market sources indicate.
The 2005-built aircraft (MSN 33821) is currently on lease to Nok Air, according to Airfinance Journal’s Fleet 
Tracker.
At Airfinance Journal’s Latin America Aviation Finance event, held from 14-15 September, the carrier indicated it 
was looking to secure two additional Boeing 737-800 leases “by the end of the week”.
“We have been overwhelmed with interest from lessors and there is not a week that goes by that some leasing 
company doesn’t come by to talk to us,” said Julian Cook, chief executive officer of Flybondi, in Rio. ”We have 
secured three aircraft with SMBC Aviation Capital already and we hope to sign another two at this conference.”
Cook, the former CEO of Swiss airline Flybaboo, says the carrier has been offered “brand new aircraft at very 
attractive lease rates” but has chosen eight-to-12-year-old aircraft instead. “It is unusual to be offered new aircraft 
as a start-up, so we reviewed the deal and decided to stick with mid-life aircraft.”
Neither Orix nor Flybondi was available at press time.
Flybondi wants to operate 10 Boeing 737-800 aircraft by the end of 2018.
It has raised $75 million of additional start-up capital and has been granted 85 routes by the Argentinian 
government, which include 43 domestic and 42 international destinations.
The company plans to start its operations this quarter with 737-800s configured with 189 seats. By 2021 it is 
targeting a fleet of 30 aircraft.
Investors in Flybondi include Cartesian Capital , Yamasa, Michael Cawley (former COO at Ryanair), Michael Powell 
(former CFO at Wizz Air), as well as other European and Argentinian private investors.

Lower fares offset 10% traffic growth to leave Ryanair’s second-quarter revenue fairly flat at &euro;2 billion ($2.33 
billion).
Operating profit of &euro;1 billion was also largely unchanged from the year-before period, despite the onset of 
flight cancellations due to a well-publicised pilot shortage.
After Ryanair’s punctuality fell to 70% in early September, the airline responded by cancelling 2% of its flights for 
the rest of September and October, and then by grounding 6% of its fleet for the November-March winter season.
In its first-half result, the airline recognised &euro;25 million of costs resulting from refunds and compensation to 
passengers.
Ryanair now proposes improved pay and job security for pilots in order to avoid such disruption again.
If accepted by pilots, this would add about &euro;100 million per year to crew costs, “but will not significantly alter 
the substantial unit cost advantage we have over all other EU airline competitors”, says Ryanair’s CEO, Michael 
O’Leary.
Ryanair’s staff costs were up 11% in the first half of 2017/18 to &euro;365 million.
The airline’s cash-flow, meanwhile, grew to &euro;313 million in the first half, a turnaround from -&euro;294 million 
in the first six months of 2016/17. This was largely due to an improvement in investment cash flow.
At 30 September 2017 Ryanair held roughly &euro;1.5 billion in cash, up from &euro;1.2 billion at the start of the 
year.
Since Q2 2016/17 the low-cost carrier’s fleet has grown from 358 to 403 Boeing 737 aircraft.
Over the same period the airline added 51 aircraft and under direct ownership and returned six leased aircraft.
The resulted in 12% higher depreciation and 6% lower lease cost for the second quarter.

Highlight: The tables are contained in a letter from the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (IALPA) to Ross
Body
Secret tables detailing how Ryanair tracks pilots’ fuel use were passed to the government six months ago, The 
Sunday Business Post can reveal.
This newspaper has established that the airline only discontinued the controversial practice, which has been 
described by critics as “undermin[ing] safety decisions”, last year.
The tables, as well as the criticisms of the airline, are contained in a letter from the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association 
(IALPA) to Minister for Transport Shane Ross, sent last March. Ross had asked IALPA for evidence to support 
assertions made in an earlier meeting that one airline, understood to be Ryanair, used the fuel league tables.
In a follow-up letter, IALPA wrote that it had explained to Ross how “atypical employment arrangements such as 
zero-hour contracts were affecting safety decision-making”.
“One of the aspects of this - which you took great interest in - was the effect of pilot fuel league tables and how 
these tables combine with atypical employment arrangements to undermine safety decisions.”
IALPA attached such a fuel league table, noting that it was “from an Irish Registered Airline”, adding that “given the 
corporate culture of fear in this Irish Registered Airline IALPA have had to give the strongest assurances that the 
source of this information would not be revealed”.
IALPA president Captain Evan Cullen wrote that he could arrange a viewing for Ross of a much more recent fuel 
league table.
It is understood that the airline being discussed, and the airline whose fuel league table was sent to the minister, is 
Ryanair.
A spokesman for Ryanair said that the arguments are “old, rehashed falsehoods”.
Shane Ross knew of secret Ryanair fuel tables six months ago
“All Ryanair flights depart with extra fuel that exceeds EU safety guidelines and all Ryanair captains are free to take 
as much fuel as they wish over and above those extra fuel guidelines.”
The correspondence was released to this newspaper, along with the fuel league table, under the Freedom of 
Information act.
The letter details how the league table functions. “You will observe that the pilots at the top of the list are coloured in 
green and the pilots at the bottom of the list are coloured in red. I would ask you to consider the effect of this 
document on pilots who are effectively on a zero-hour contract and find themselves on the bottom of this 
document,” adding that pilots at the bottom of the list receive a letter regarding their ‘fuel burn’ performance.
Critics of the fuel burn monitoring say that it can provide a perverse incentive to pilots to carry the bare minimum of 
fuel, as heavier planes with greater fuel loads require more power to fly, and therefore are more expensive to run.
It is understood that the airline continues to monitor pilot fuel use, although a Ryanair spokesman said that “average 
fuel usage (not uplifts) are tracked to ensure flights operate at safe speeds only”.
The spokesman said that “There is no atypical employment at Ryanair. There are no zero-hour contracts at 
Ryanair. These claims are false”.
He said IALPA “had a long record of making false claims about Ryanair”. IALPA denies the accusation.
It comes amid ongoing controversy over Ryanair’s pilot and cabin crew employment regime. This weekend, 
employment law experts told The Sunday Business Post that Ryanair could soon face a slew of employment 
actions from Irish pilots.
“In my opinion, they’re either going to have to resolve the issue with the pilots in a proactive way, or they’ll get into 
serious industrial relations issues,” Richard J Grogan, a solicitor in employment law, told this newspaper.
Labour Party senator Ged Nash said that legislation he introduced during his time as employment minister would 
enable Ryanair workers to challenge the airline over their terms and conditions.
“What seems clear to everyone watching this unfold is that the days of the traditional Ryanair approach to industrial 
relations would appear to be numbered. Time will tell, but time is not on their side.”
Jim Phillips, a pilot and spokesman for Vereinigung Cockpit, an association representing commercial aircraft 
operators and flight engineers in Germany, said that Ryanair had left German pilots open to investigation on the 
grounds of income tax and social security fraud.
The German state prosecutor is currently investigating more than 550 pilots who have worked for Ryanair under its 
contractor, or freelance, employment model.
Those pilots should not be the subject of the investigation, Phillips said, nor should they be paying the back taxes 
and fines, which he calculated at more than €15 million.
Phillips said: “The pilots never created this model, they were forced into it.”

Highlight: Michael O’Leary has treated most rows as a game he can control. This time it’s different, as it’s 
impacting on the airline’s profit 
Body
Michael O’Leary’s critics are emerging from the long grass in droves – and they are clearly enjoying his and 
Ryanair’s great discomfort.
If you think the Irish media has been jumping on him and Ryanair over the last fortnight – and obviously with 
considerable justification – then it pales in comparison with much of the coverage in the British media in particular 
and further afield.
Schadenfreude is defined as the satisfaction or pleasure felt at someone else’s misfortune. There has been plenty 
of it on display; some commentators have even gone so far as to openly speculate as to whether O’Leary and even 
Ryanair can survive the self-inflicted blow to their reputations.
The idea that either or both are doomed is likely to be a gross exaggeration. But O’Leary’s list of enemies – and that 
is not an inappropriate word, even if some would deny enmity – is long. Many would enjoy seeing him go away . . . 
and preferably humiliated to boot.
These critics include scorned sections of the media, politicians, airport, aviation and consumer protection 
regulators, rival airlines and European Commission officials.
Many, still smarting from insults from O’Leary and his minions about the performance of their duties, even if 
delivered many years earlier, have enjoyed the boot being on the other foot.
If he gives out stick – and he has done so loudly and provocatively for decades – then he has to take it. O’Leary 
understands that and is most unlikely to be upset at what’s being said about him. He has shown a remarkably thick 
skin to responses in the past, ever since he decided that he would do whatever it took to drum up publicity for the 
airline he represents.
Matt Cooper on Ryanair
He has treated most rows as a game he can control. He has long believed that there is no such thing as bad 
publicity, or at least nothing that can’t be solved by a quick seat sale, at prices as low as €9.99.
This time it’s different, however. Even if it doesn’t really matter to him that his own reputation (among the public, if 
not as much with investors, who are more likely to remain loyal) is at risk, he will have concerns about the extent of 
the negative impact on the airline’s profits. That’s all that really matters to him.
Unfortunately for O’Leary, last week’s tried and trusted seat sale effort blew up in his face. No sooner had he 
launched it than he was following it with news of further cancellations of 18,000 flights between November and 
March 2018, affecting 400,000 potential passengers - and including some who had just bought tickets in his sale. 
He had said only the previous week that there would be no further cancellations of flights.
Even some investors, usually loyal because of the profits Ryanair produces, seemingly no matter what, moved to 
sell shares in response, although that has happened too during previous, lesser, crises.
O’Leary has never been too concerned in the past by sudden falls in the share price. He has always been confident 
he could overcome adverse sentiment, even when it has been the result of profit warnings by Ryanair.
The cold hard facts of long-term massive profits, enormous passenger numbers and consistent growth always 
trumped the opinions of those who didn’t like the methods by which those achievements were met.
O’Leary’s legion of supporters have long had a persuasive, factually based, argument that he is Ireland’s most 
successful ever businessman, and that Ryanair is one of the country’s most extraordinary and worthwhile 
companies.
His critics tended to trade in emotional responses related to his bad treatment of people and the apparent 
excessiveness of his behaviour in making money. Now the facts are falling in their favour.
Ryanair has botched its schedule and badly miscalculated its staffing requirements. It scrambled on Friday to avoid 
investigation and sanction for allegedly falling short of its legal obligations to customers in its compensation policy.
This is basic stuff, and not what would be expected of a highly professional and consistently successful airline. It 
also leaves O’Leary’s “always getting better” strategy – one which suddenly treated customers much better and got 
fantastic results in additional revenues - in disarray.
O’Leary has always shown disdain for what the likes of British consumer magazine Which? have said, believing that 
criticism of customer interaction has never impacted on profits. But he has reason to worry that others throughout 
Europe will follow the hardline approach of Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority.
Publicity about cancelling flights is one thing, but it may impact on future bookings if people feel they will not be able 
to get a proper refund once they cannot get a flight.
The size of Ryanair has changed everything: it is now the biggest short-haul carrier in Europe, carrying 115 million 
passengers a year, making annual profits of over €1 billion, so flight cancellations now get a much higher profile 
than they used to previously.
O’Leary used to cancel Ryanair flights on a regular basis. When the airline was struggling for survival in the early 
1990s, O’Leary, working at Ryanair without an official title on behalf of its founder Tony Ryan, and Conor Hayes, his 
predecessor as chief executive, were ruthless about suddenly cancelling flights – and to hell with complaints or bad 
publicity.
It didn’t matter if passengers were waiting in the terminal to embark. Any flight was likely to be cancelled if the 
booking numbers, and fares paid, meant the individual flight would not make a profit for Ryanair.
Matt Cooper on Ryanair
The jilted passenger was lucky if he or she got a seat on the next plane. It was tough luck if that plane was going 
three days later rather than three hours later. People found themselves stranded at 10pm in the evening, and no 
compensation or accommodation would be provided.
Cash was extremely tight at the time, and O’Leary didn’t want to go back to Ryan for more loans to keep Ryanair in 
the air. Ryanair was a small struggling airline then, of course, flying exclusively between Ireland and Britain, yet it 
took the risk to reputational damage, despite the fury of customers.
Conventional wisdom in the airline industry was that the service had to be provided once the tickets had been sold, 
even if at a loss, or people would never come back to buy a ticket again. O’Leary – and Hayes – thought differently.
Even then, O’Leary thought little of how others saw things. His entire focus was the bottom line. To get profits, he 
believed in charging lower fares than rivals. To do that he had to have lower costs than any other airline enjoyed. 
That remains his obsession . . . and it may well have contributed to his crisis of recent weeks.
Over the last year, I’ve been researching a book about Ryanair and O’Leary, one that once I’ve finished writing is to 
be published late next year. It has been emphasised to me by various sources that O’Leary’s ruthlessness in driving 
down costs to the lowest level possible has never wavered, not even when the company decided four years ago to 
adopt its strategy of being nicer to customers. If anything, he became more obsessive about not allowing being nice 
to soften the approach to keeping costs under the tightest of controls.
He appears to have miscalculated how much he has to pay pilots to maintain the loyalty of a sufficient number to fly 
his planes. O’Leary does not want to pay his staff any more than is absolutely necessary . . . and he has not been 
able to sort out the issue quickly enough. His offers to pilots may have had large headline-grabbing numbers 
attached, but the terms and conditions, as ever, were not to their liking.
The ongoing debate about working conditions at the airline is unlikely to worry O’Leary unduly. Experience suggests 
that the majority of customers care little about the pay of pilots and cabin crew. All they want is cheaper flights than 
rivals operate and ones that get to their destination safely. That will remain O’Leary’s priority.
Wednesday’s announcement was widely regarded as O’Leary providing critics with yet another stick with which to 
beat Ryanair. However, the announcement may have been a very rational and good one. He has bought himself 
time to strike a longer-term deal. It will be at a considerable price, but on his terms – and he will do whatever he can 
to ensure that it will not translate into higher ticket prices.
O’Leary, of course, as the heartbeat of Ryanair, will not be leaving – unless a further disaster unfolds. He is 
Ryanair. Other heads may roll, however. He will find people to blame for what has been an unholy mess.
While he may shoulder some blame internally – as well as being the public face of guilt - he is as likely to be 
ruthless in dispatching others as he is in protecting himself. Within Ryanair there may be many hiding in the tall 
grass to ensure he does not turn his attention to them.

Our booking system is full of people who swore they would never fly with us again," an unrepentant Michael 
O'Leary boasted last week, just a moment after offering his "unreserved apology" for the mess over pilot rosters 
that led Ryanair to cancel flights affecting more than 700,000 passengers. The Irish airline's abrasive chief 
executive has a point. He has always acted on the principle that passengers will put up with anything so long as the 
flight lands safely and the price is low enough. He has repeatedly been proved right. Ryanair thrived despite its 
reputation for chaotic queues, invasive advertising, aggressive baggage checks and infuriating add-on charges. It 
pioneered many of the tactics by which low-cost airlines have upended their industry and proved that shorthaul 
carriers can make money. But even Ryanair found there was a point at which poor customer service impinges on 
growth. In 2013, Mr O'Leary declared his intent to "eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off". The aim was 
to pitch for more lucrative business passengers, who demand a modicum of comfort and set store by punctuality - 
and it paid off.
Yet Mr O'Leary's instinctive contempt for customers and employees appears to be intact - and ingrained in 
Ryanair's corporate culture. This ought to be a concern for both regulators and shareholders.
It is still not clear why a relatively minor change in regulation - counting pilots' flying hours over a calendar rather 
than a fiscal year - should have caused so much disruption. Ryanair rejects suggestions that it does not have 
enough pilots and is struggling to retain them. But Mr O'Leary workforce relations are clearly delicate. It is also 
apparent that there is no slack at all in the system. Zero frills is one thing; but a bare bones approach to operational 
matters is more worrying.
Ryanair still flies a flag of contempt for customers Regulators cannot allow O'Leary to defy the law with impunity
The mistakes that caused the cancellations are minor, though, next to the airline's flagrant attempt to ignore its legal 
obligations to passengers. Mr O'Leary said openly at first that Ryanair would not pay to book people on to flights 
with other airlines where necessary, nor would it reimburse expenses incurred as a result of the cancellations. This 
was inexcusable. As the head of the Civil Aviation Authority put it: "People shouldn't have to choose between low 
fares and legal rights."
Ryanair has now recanted, saying on Friday it had met regulators and agreed steps to fulfil its obligations and 
ensure passengers were aware of their rights. This will probably be enough to avert the CAA's threat of legal action.
Mr O'Leary insists there will be no lasting repercussions, and no impact on this year's profits. Investors seem to 
agree: the share price has dipped, but is still 30 per cent higher than a year ago.
It is true that Ryanair can easily absorb the immediate cost of compensating passengers. The airline may need to 
hire more crew as well as raising pilot pay but, even after this, its operating costs will be much lower than those of 
its nearest rivals. A recent ruling by the European Court of Justice, which will allow cabin crew to pursue claims in 
the countries where they are based, and not only in Irish courts, is a bigger threat to its business model.
Nonetheless, Mr O'Leary should not assume the affair will blow over. Passengers have short memories but 
business travellers pay for reliability. And the airline is under pressure from European authorities who think the 
favourable tax treatment it receives in Ireland, and its use of Irish employment law, allows it to undercut rivals 
unfairly. Conciliation is not Mr O'Leary's style, but it might be worth his while to try it for a change.

Has Ryanair finally gone too far? For years the fast-growing European budget airline seemed to take pride in how 
badly it treated its customers and staff.
Over the years, its irascible chief executive Michael O'Leary has referred to passengers as "morons", insisting that 
"we don't want to hear your sob stories". The Irish carrier is famous for layering on fees for everything from talking 
to a human being to checking in bags. Mr O'Leary even publicly mused about charging for use of the toilet.
As for staff, he has boasted about how little he pays pilots. Analysts say Ryanair uses thinner staffing levels than 
rivals, and it has lower ratings on employee satisfaction website Glassdoor.
And yet it keeps growing - from 650,000 passengers a year in 1991 to a projected 130m this year. Customers have 
been willing to put up with the hassle and disdain in exchange for dirt cheap flights. Ryanair in May predicted full-
year profits would top (EURO)1.4bn.
But now that rising trajectory is under threat. Ryanair has had to cancel thousands of flights affecting more than 
700,000 passengers as it struggles to cope with a staffing shortage. The airline blames a regulatory change in the 
rules around pilot holidays for its decision to cancel 50 flights a day for six weeks and then suspend 34 routes, 
grounding 25 of its 400 planes to the end of April.
Ryanair 's years of squeezing staff land it in a storm The Top Line Brooke Masters Companies editor
Investor reaction so far has been relatively sanguine - the airline's shares are down 16 per cent from their August 
all-time peak, but are still up 30 per cent over the past 12 months. Mr O'Leary comfortably won re-election to the 
board with 99 per cent of votes cast last week.
Ryanair has said the cancellations will cost less than (EURO)50m all together but its management and investors 
may well be missing three critical points.
Authorities in key hubs are taking notice. The UK Civil Aviation Authority has accused the carrier of misleading 
passengers whose flights have been cancelled about their rights, and Italy has launched an inquiry into alleged 
violations of consumer rights. If Ryanair is forced to do more on consumer care, that could drive costs.
The years of squeezing its staff have done little to build loyalty. Pilots have already turned down an offer that would 
have given them a bonus in exchange for waiving a week of holiday time and agreeing to stay on for a year. Other 
carriers including Norwegian are growing and recruiting actively. Watch out for employee turnover to hit 
performance and, again, costs.
Most importantly, the cancellations threaten a crucial but often overlooked part of Ryanair's appeal: it may be rude 
but it used to be reliable. Its planes play a recorded trumpet every time they arrive on time, and its performance was 
comparable with more expensive rivals. Some 83 per cent of flights were on time in July. But pilot rota troubles 
pushed that below 80 per cent in early August, and the confusing way the first cancellations were announced 
initially left 18m people wondering if their flights would be grounded. The second round further undermined 
passenger trust. Consumer group Which? complained the carrier had "effectively cancelled Christmas".
Airline customers will forgive many things - even at United, which beat and forcibly removed a passenger from a 
plane in April. But they do want to get where they are going. Who would do a deal with the devil if his planes cannot 
be counted on to fly? brooke.masters@ft.com See Editorial Comment

Ryanair has bowed to pressure from regulators to inform thousands of passengers of their full rights to 
compensation for cancelled flights.
The Irish low-cost airline yesterday updated its website and sent out emails to affected customers explaining they 
had the option of claiming for extra expenses incurred as a result of the cancellations, as well as the option of being 
re-routed on other airlines.
Britain's aviation authority this week accused Ryanair of persistently misleading passengers about their rights after 
cancelling thousands of flights in the past two weeks. The Civil Aviation Authority on Wednesday said it was 
bringing enforcement action against Ryanair, the first step towards court action if breaches of consumer protection 
law persist.
The CAA ordered the low-cost carrier to say publicly how it would re-route passengers if required, as well as the 
criteria that it would apply to re-route passengers on other airlines.
It also demanded that Ryanair say how it would reimburse passengers for expenses such as travel, food and hotel 
costs. The CAA gave the airline a deadline of 5pm yesterday to make these changes.
The regulator said the airline had to spell out how it would help any passengers whose flights have been cancelled 
in the past two weeks, who were given an unsuitable option at the time because of misleading information that 
Ryanair bows to CAA on passenger rights Airlines
came from Ryanair. While Ryanair submitted to the regulator's demands, it also hit out at the CAA over what it said 
was a different approach to rival airlines.
"Ryanair has called upon the UK CAA to now require UK airlines to comply with these EU261 obligations which the 
CAA did not apply to British Airways in May this year, when a computer meltdown stranded hundreds of thousands 
of British citizens/visitors at London Heathrow and many other airports, with no apparent action taken by the CAA in 
respect of re-accommodation or enforcement against British Airways," Ryanair wrote.
British Airways rejected the claim: "We were, and remain, fully compliant with our EU261 obligations in relation to 
customer compensation."
Andrew Haines, CAA chief executive, said: "It appears that Ryanair has now capitulated. We will review their 
position in detail and monitor this situation to ensure that passengers get what they are entitled to in practice."
He added: "We are consistent in this approach ... as part of our ongoing work to protect consumers, earlier this 
month we wrote to over 30 airlines seeking confirmation that they too are complying with the re-routing elements of 
EC261 legislation."
In a letter to Ryanair on Wednesday, the CAA said Michael O'Leary, chief executive, had wrongly claimed that the 
carrier was not obliged to find seats on alternative airlines for passengers affected by cancelled flights.
The action comes as the Irish carrier axed flights for a further 400,000 passengers travelling between November 
and March, less than two weeks after it cancelled up to 2,100 flights affecting about 315,000 flyers.
"We apologise again sincerely for the disruption and inconvenience our rostering failure has caused some of our 
customers," said Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer of Ryanair.

Ryanair said on Wednesday that it will cancel more flights this winter, in a move that will hit some 400,000 flyers as 
it looks to ease scheduling pressures after sparking controversy earlier this month with a round of cancellations.
Consumers affected have been sent an email, providing five weeks to five months' notice to schedule changes. 
They have been offered a full refund or alternative flights as well as a travel voucher, Ryanair said.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair caved in to pressure from regulators Friday and issued a statement telling passengers 
about their right to compensation for the thousands of flights that it has cancelled.
The move came as the budget airline faced the threat of legal action over the allegedly misleading statements it has 
made so far. Britain's Civil Aviation Authority had given Ryanair until 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) to issue the press release 
and provide a link to it on the company's website.
The regulator said Wednesday it had begun an enforcement action against the Dublin-based airline for "persistently 
misleading passengers" about their right to compensation following cancellations that the airline said resulted from 
pilot scheduling errors.
"We apologize again sincerely for the disruption and inconvenience our rostering failure has caused some of our 
customers," said Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs.
The regulator threatened to take legal action after Ryanair on Wednesday scrapped 18,000 flights in a second 
round of cancelations following the airline's admission that it "messed up" the scheduling of pilot vacations.
The watchdog said it would not hesitate to take action on consumer laws when an airline "is systematically flouting 
these rules."
"It appears that Ryanair has now capitulated," said Andrew Haines, the regulator's chief executive. "We will review 
their position in detail and monitor this situation to ensure that passengers get what they are entitled to."
The agency alleged the airline failed to tell customers it would re-route their travel on other carriers if no suitable 
flights were available on Ryanair and pay out-of-pocket expenses resulting from the cancellations.
Earlier, Britain's ITV News unearthed an internal Ryanair memo that allegedly instructed call center staff to offer 
flights with other carriers - provided the price "does not exceed three times the value of the original Ryanair fare."
The consumer group Which? criticized the airline's policy.
Ryanair bows to UK regulator demand on passenger rights
"Ryanair appears to be plucking figures out of thin air as there is no legal basis for the arbitrary figure they've set," 
Managing Director Alex Neill said. "The law says passengers must be rerouted and there's no specified limit on 
cost. This yet again highlights the importance of the action which the Civil Aviation Authority has started."

The rights of airline passengers flying with Ryanair "need to be protected," Ireland's prime minister said Friday, in 
the wake of the budget carrier cancelling thousands of flights.
Ryanair announced this month that it would cancel about 18,000 flights until the end of October to accommodate for 
a backlog of holidays for its crew.
On Wednesday, the airline said that it would also cut 25 planes, or 6 per cent of its fleet, this winter as it slows its 
planned growth in light of the mass cancellations.
"I think it's as simple as this: people's and passengers' rights need to be protected," Irish Prime Minister Leo 
Varadkar said at the sidelines of an EU summit in Estonia.
"So, if anyone has had a flight cancelled, any airline, in this case Ryanair, needs to provide them with an alternative 
way of getting them where they need to go or refund them in full. I'd absolutely expect the airlines to do that."
He said he counted on Ireland's Commission of Aviation Regulation to make sure passengers' rights are upheld.
Ryanair said it met with the commission on Friday and agreed to implement measures to better inform customers of 
their rights and claims ahead of a deadline by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.
The airline said in a statement that it had emailed all affected customers clarifying their rights to refunds and re-
routing and compensation.

Ryanair, Europe's busiest airline, was warned to deliver "action, not words" by British aviation authorities on 
Thursday after it failed to inform 400,000 customers of their full rights regarding canceled flights through Christmas.
Ryanair has more than doubled its unprecedented cancellations since last week, with cuts now affecting more than 
700,000 customers over the next five months.
Ryanair has denied it has a pilots shortage and has blamed the wave of cancellations on pilot rostering problems.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority rebuked the Irish budget airline for providing "misleading information" after it offered 
affected customers refunds or alternative Ryanair flights.
The rules oblige Ryanair to also offer customers flights on other airlines if there is no suitableRyanair service 
available.
The CAA also accused Ryanair of failing to inform passengers about its obligation to cover additional expenses 
incurred because of a canceled flight, such as hotels and meals.
"We will be meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to," Ryanair said in 
a statement on Thursday.
CAA CEO Andrew Haines told Sky News on Thursday that the CAA was "furious" with Ryanairand that the 
regulator wanted to see "action, not words."
Ryanair urged to take action by UK regulator
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary last week sought to address the airline's problems with a first wave of 315,000 
cancellations.
He told investors then that the impact would be less than 25 million euros and that Ryanair was finalizing a bid for 
struggling Italian carrier Alitalia.
On Wednesday, that cost figure doubled and Ryanair abruptly dropped its planned Alitalia bid.
"We've made it clear their behavior is unacceptable... It's only when we get to steps of court action very often that 
they are prepared to comply with the law," the CAA's Haines said.
The CAA has the power to seek legal undertakings from operators to make sure they comply with consumer rights 
law and to take court action if they fail to do so.
Ryanair shares were down 2% on Thursday. The stock gained more than 3% on Wednesday as analysts welcomed 
the company's plan to restrict growth this winter and its decision to drop its planned bid for Alitalia. (Reuters)

RYANAIR has been told to correct its compensation policy for passengers by 5pm today, with the regulator saying 
the airline must stop misleading customers over the ability to re-route to another airline.
Ryanair's share price dropped yesterday as its flight cancellation headache worsened with the news that the 
aviation regulator was "furious" with the airline.
The Civil Aviation Authority said this week that it was launching enforcement action against Ryanair for "persistently 
misleading passengers". The airline's shares fell by more than four per cent yesterday.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair pledged to comply with any conditions imposed by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority after it 
threatened to file legal action against the budget carrier for "persistently misleading passengers" about their rights 
amid a series of flight cancelations.
The CAA issued its warning Wednesday, after Ryanair scrapped 18,000 more flights in a second round of 
cancelations following the airline's admission that it "messed up" the scheduling of pilot vacations. The Dublin-
based carrier said 34 routes would be suspended from November to March 2018, affecting some 400,000 
customers who had already booked flights.
"We will be meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to," Ryanair said in 
a statement.
The aviation agency said Ryanair failed to tell customers that it would re-route their travel on other airlines if there 
were no Ryanair flights available in a reasonable amount of time. Ryanair also didn't tell customers that the airline is 
obliged to refund the cost of expenses such as meals and hotels incurred as a result of flight cancelations, and 
cover expenses for anyone forced to travel to a different airport for a replacement flight, the CAA said.
Regulators said they told Ryanair about these obligations after the airline announced the first round of flight 
cancelations on Sept. 18.
The agency said it launched an enforcement action against Ryanair for "persistently misleading passengers with 
inaccurate information regarding their rights."
"There are clear laws in place, which are intended to assist passengers in the event of a cancellation, helping 
minimize both the frustration and inconvenience caused by circumstances completely out of their control," the 
regulator's chief executive, Andrew Haines, said in a statement. "We have made this crystal clear to Ryanair, who 
are well aware of their legal obligations, which includes how and when they should reroute passengers, along with 
the level of information it provides its passengers."
UK aviation regulator threatens action against Ryanair
Ryanair said Wednesday that it planned to reduce its fleet and slow growth to manage "exceptional volumes of 
annual leave," as it adjusts to a new scheduling system. The airline says it has been forced to schedule a full year 
of pilot vacation time in nine months because it is shifting to a scheduling year that begins in January, rather than 
April.
Pilot representatives argue that Ryanair has a pilot shortage and has mismanaged the changeover, which was 
required by new aviation safety rules that the airline has known about for two years.
Whatever the cause, dealing with the fallout remains a challenge for Ryanair.
Britain's newspapers summed up the anger among travelers, with the Daily Mail's front page headline reading "Now 
Ryanair cancels Xmas," and the Daily Mirror adding "Now Ryanair ruins hols for 400,000 more passengers."

Ryanair cancels flights of another 400,000 customers
Ryanair cancels flights of another 400,000 customers

Ryanair canceled the flights of another 400,000 customers and scrapped a bid for Alitalia on Wednesday, in a plan 
to keep its pilots on side and draw a line under its rostering fiasco.
Just last week Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had said no more flights would be canceled due to pilot rostering 
issues that caused the grounding of over 2,000 flights in September and October, hitting the airline's share price 
and reputation.
But on Wednesday the airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, said it would cancel flights for around 
400,000 passengers in addition to 300,000 impacted by earlier travel cancellations.
In a lengthy statement addressing customers, pilots and shareholders, Ryanair said the move would minimize flight 
delays and would mean an earlier threat to force pilots to reschedule holidays would not be carried out.
In order to "eliminate all management distractions," Ryanair also pulled out of the bidding for struggling Italian 
airline Alitalia, less than two weeks after O'Leary said it was in the process of finalizing a binding offer.
"It appears they have taken stock and decided to nip this in the bud," independent aviation consultant John 
Strickland said.
"It's a thorough, comprehensive plan to make sure they get this battleship back on track and ensure it can continue 
to grow. By coming out with this detailed information, it shows Ryanair is not trying to push this under the carpet."
Shares in Ryanair jumped after it said the plan would eliminate "all risk" of further cancellations and that it would not 
alter its 1.4 billion to 1.45 billion euro profit forecast for the financial year ending March 31.
Ryanair cancels flights of another 400,000 customers
Shares in Ryanair, which fell by over 4 percent last week, closed 3.4 percent higher.
Ryanair blamed the original cancellations on a backlog of staff leave and outlined a carrot-and-stick approach last 
week, offering some pilots pay increases and cash incentives to work extra days but also saying others may have to 
postpone leave.
It said on Wednesday that the reduced schedule would mean it would not need pilots to give up one week of their 
annual leave from November and that the slower growth of the airline would create a large surplus of standby pilots.
Some Ryanair pilots have in recent weeks been encouraging each other to band together to take advantage of 
increased demand for experienced pilots – especially among low-cost carriers - to force management to improve 
conditions.
The decision to fly 25 fewer aircraft from November and 10 fewer from April 2018, will "provide stability to pilot 
rosters," Ryanair said.
The 34 routes affected during the winter season include some UK domestic routes between London and Scotland, 
plus its only domestic route in Germany between Berlin and Cologne, where a gap in the market will soon be left by 
the insolvency of German carrier Air Berlin.
The airline cut its expected passenger volumes to 129 million from 131 million and to 138 million from 142 million in 
the following 12 months to March 2019.
Average fares are also expected to be slightly lower over the next two months as it promotes seat sales, it added.
O'Leary, who has taken personal responsibility for the "cock-up," apologized to those disrupted by the cancellations 
and said all customers have been emailed with the offer of an exchange or refund and an additional 40 euro 
voucher for each flight, to be used before March.
Analysts welcomed Ryanair's decision not to pursue its interest in Alitalia. Ryanair's plans could have added around 
90 Alitalia planes, including long-haul.
"Ryanair's decision not to pursue the Alitalia bid is a relief, as this was always likely to be a big distraction from its 
core focus," said Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation.
"Ryanair will recover from this," he said. (Reuters)

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - The European markets were stuck in a narrow range throughout 
Thursday's session, but managed to log slight increases. The markets extended their winning streak to six straight 
days. Bank stocks were among the top gainers of the session on expectations for interest rate hikes from the 
Federal Reserve. Retailers were also in focus, following the disappointing results reported by H&M.  The Bank of 
Spain warned on Thursday that the political tensions surrounding the referendum being held for Catalonia's 
independence could hurt economic activity. 
 Catalonia is set to hold the referendum on October 1.  'Regarding the risks to the growth forecasts, political 
tensions in Catalonia could possibly affect confidence, spending decisions and financing conditions,' the bank said 
in its quarterly report.  The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.13 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index 
of eurozone bluechip stocks increased 0.23 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major 
U.K. companies, lost 0.03 percent.  The DAX of Germany climbed 0.37 percent and the CAC 40 of France rose 
0.22 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. gained 0.13 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.15 
percent.  In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank advanced 2.39 percent.  In London, Barclays climbed 0.97 percent and 
Standard Chartered added 1.03 percent.  Ryanair lost 4.32 percent as the airline faces legal action for 'persistently 
misleading' passengers about their rights following the wave of flight cancellations because of a shortage of pilots.  
Imperial Brands fell 4.11 percent after reports that it is in talks to help save struggling wholesaler Palmer & Harvey 
Holdings.  TUI dropped 0.24 percent after the travel company said trading since its last update has remained in line 
with the Group's expectations.  Hennes & Mauritz sank 5.08 percent in Stockholm after the retailer posted weaker-
than-expected third-quarter earnings.  Eurozone economic confidence strengthened in September, survey data 
from the European Commission showed Thursday. The economic sentiment index rose to 113.0 in September from 
111.9 in August. The reading was also above the expected 112.  German consumer confidence is set to weaken in 
October, survey data from the market research group GfK showed Thursday. The forward-looking consumer 
sentiment index fell unexpectedly to 10.8 from 10.9 in September. The score was forecast to rise to 11.0.  
Germany's inflation remained unchanged at its highest level in four months in September, preliminary data from 
Destatis showed Thursday. The consumer price index rose 1.8 percent year-on-year, same as in August, and in line 
with economists' expectations.  Economic activity in the U.S. increased by slightly more than previously estimated 
European Markets Struggle To Extend Winning Streak
in the second quarter, the Commerce Department revealed in a report on Thursday.  The report said gross 
domestic product jumped by 3.1 percent in the second quarter compared to the previously estimated 3.0 percent 
growth. Economists had expected the pace of GDP growth to be unrevised.  After reporting unexpected decreases 
in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the two previous weeks, the Labor Department released a 
report on Thursday showing a rebound in initial jobless claims in the week ended September 23rd.  The report said 
initial jobless claims rose to 272,000, an increase of 12,000 from the previous week's revised level of 260,000. 
Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 270,000 from the 259,000 originally reported for the previous 
week.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stocks steadied on Thursday after five sessions of 
gains, even as banks rallied on expectations for higher interest rates going forward.  The pan-European Stoxx 
Europe 600 index was marginally lower at 385.57 in late opening deals after rising 0.4 percent in the previous 
session. 
  The German DAX was moving up 0.3 percent, France's CAC 40 was rising 0.2 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100

the back of higher bond yields after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his long-awaited tax reform plan 
overnight.  Hennes & Mauritz shares fell more than 5 percent after the Swedish retailer posted weaker-than-

misleading' passengers about their rights following the wave of flight cancellations because of a shortage of pilots.  
Imperial Brands fell 2.3 percent after reports that it is in talks to help save struggling wholesaler Palmer & Harvey 
Holdings.  The day's economic reports proved to be a mixed bag. German consumer confidence is set to weaken in 
October, but consumers still believe the economy will continue to contribute significantly to overall economic 
development, survey data from market research group GfK showed.  The forward-looking consumer sentiment 
index fell unexpectedly to 10.8 from 10.9 in September.   A gauge of Euro zone economic sentiment improved more 
than expected in September to reach levels last seen in July 2007, data from the European Commission revealed.

UK budget airline easyJet has taken a step towards a future without jet fuel with plans to help develop a battery 
powered aircraft.
The group said yesterday that it had reached an agreement with US aircraft designer Wright Electric to develop an 
electric aircraft for flights that take less than two hours.
If the project works, it will cut emissions, noise and fuel consumption, according to Carolyn McCall, easyJet's chief 
executive.
"For the first time in my career I can envisage a future without jet fuel and we are excited to be part of it," Dame 
Carolyn said. "It is now more a matter of when, not if, a short-haul electric will fly."
The new, larger aircraft would have a range of 335 miles, the two companies said. According to easyJet this means 
it could fly from London to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Glasgow or Edinburgh.
EasyJet said it was not committing cash to the partnership with Wright Electric. Instead it will provide advice and 
industry expertise that will allow the US company to develop a batterypropelled commercial airliner.
Wright Electric was founded in 2015 by US entrepreneur Jeffrey Engler and electric aircraft designer Chip Yates.

It already has a prototype for a twoseater electric aircraft, which Mr Yates developed previously, and is working with 
several airlines including easyJet to convert this into a 120-seat passenger aircraft. The other airline partners have 
not agreed for their names to be publicised.
Mr Engler told the Financial Times that their plan would be achieved within a decade, although he was unsure how 
much building the first would cost.
Wright Electric has raised seed funding for the project but is not disclosing the amount.
Mr Engler added that the project was "daunting from every perspective".
EasyJet is publicising its electric partnership at the same time as rival lowcost airline Ryanair has been reeling from 
the fallout of being forced to cancel thousands of flights abruptly after it made pilot scheduling errors.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has apologised to customers and offered a £40 travel voucher per flight 
cancelled.

THE CIVIL Aviation Authority (CAA) last night said it would accelerate "enforcement action" for "persistently 
misleading customers" with inaccurate information after a spate of mass flight cancellations.
The budget airline announced yesterday that 34 routes will be suspended from November through to March 2018 
as it seeks to bring an end to recent flight cancellation troubles. The decision means routes including London 
Gatwick to Belfast, and London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow have been suspended, with up to 18,000 
flights and 400,000 more people affected.
The London-listed Irish airline said it will slow growth to curb the risk of having to announce more cancellations by 
flying 25 fewer aircraft and reducing its flying schedule.
But yesterday's cancellations prompted the regulator to expedite enforcement against the airline, saying the airline 
had "failed to provide customers with the necessary and accurate information relating to their passenger rights, 
particularly around re-routing and care and assistance entitlements, which includes expenses". The regulator has 
warned it could seek legal action against Ryanair for breaching consumer protection laws, though it is not yet clear 
what form the enforcement action will take.
The action comes after Ryanair said it was cancelling 2,000 flights after the airline miscalculated pilot leave.
CAA chief executive Andrew Haines said: "In expediting our enforcement action we are seeking to ensure that 
Ryanair's customers will receive the correct and necessary information, to make an informed choice about an 
alternative flight."

Alex Neill, of Which?, said: "Ryanair is still flouting the law and failing to properly inform people of their rights, so it 
is good to see the regulator stepping in. They must ensure their intervention forces Ryanair to immediately change 
its behaviour and comply with the law."
Ryanair shares closed up 4.01 per cent yesterday, despite the cancellations. The enforcement action was 
announced after the market had closed.

Ryanair has pulled out of bidding for rival Alitalia, saying it needed to "eliminate all management distractions" to 
repair its rostering problem, which caused it to cancel around 18,000 flights yesterday.
The Irish low-cost carrier axed flights for a further 400,000 passengers travelling between November and March, 
less than two weeks after it cancelled up to 2,100 flights affecting about 315,000 customers.
Ryanair said it had notified the commissioners in charge of Alitalia's administration that it would not be pursuing its 
interest in the Italian airline.
"In order to focus on repairing this rostering problem this winter, Ryanair will eliminate all management distractions 
starting with its interest in Alitalia," the airline said.
It is a U-turn for the budget carrier, which confirmed plans last week to make a binding offer for Alitalia. The 
deadline for bids for the Italian airline is October 16.
Since the cancellations, Ryanair has faced a backlash in Italy, which is a big hub for the airline. Antitrust authorities 
last week launched an inquiry into alleged violations of consumer rights, and key government ministers criticised its 
handling of the affair, with Carlo Calenda, the economic development minister, and Graziano Delrio, the transport 
minister, calling for "zero tolerance" with regard to the Irish airline. "What happened with Ryanair is very serious 
Ryanair drops Alitalia bid to focus on rosters Airlines ; Carrier seeks to 'eliminate distractions' after halting 
second batch of flights
because the disservice to citizens was substantial," Mr Calenda said last week, adding that when considering its bid 
for Alitalia, the government could not ignore "workers' conditions".
However, one person close to the situation said it was unlikely that the government would have told Ryanair not to 
bid for Alitalia - but rather, it could not have managed a bid for the Italian airline at the same time as it was handling 
disruption for travellers.
The additional cancellations come as Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has grappled to resolve its pilot 
shortage. Last week, it blamed its roster mess-up on a regulatory change that forces airlines to count crew flying 
hours over a calendar year, instead of its fiscal year from April to March, which left the airline with too few standby 
pilots on its roster. At the time, Mr O'Leary insisted Ryanair would not have to make any further cancellations.
But the airline yesterday rowed back on threats to take back a week's holiday from pilots, which was part of its initial 
plans to solve its current crisis.
Ryanair said the fresh flight cancellations would mean it "will not need pilots to give up one week of their well-
earned annual leave from November onwards". It also denied it had a pilot shortage, stating that in the current year 
fewer than 100 captains had left and fewer than 160 first officers.
The airline said it had recruited and would train more than 650 pilots over the next eight months.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares were little changed in lackluster trade on Thursday 
even as banks gained ground on expectations for higher interest rates going forward.   The Bank of England's chief

economy healing.  The benchmark FTSE 100 was virtually unchanged at 7,315 in late opening deals after rising 0.4 
percent on Wednesday.  Lender Barclays rose over 2 percent, Standard Chartered advanced 0.7 percent and 
Lloyds Banking Group added 0.6 percent on the back of higher bond yields after U.S. President Donald Trump

Ryanair appears to be adopting a non-combative stance after the UK Civil Aviation Authority threatened legal action 
to ensure compliance with passenger rights legislation.
The CAA has invited Ryanair representatives to a meeting to discuss the airline's handling of passengers in the 
wake of mass flight cancellations, after the regulator expressed doubts that Ryanair was explicitly offering to reroute 
customers on other carriers.
Ryanair simply states that it "will be meeting" with the CAA and adds: "[We] will comply fully with whatever 
requirements they ask us to."
The budget airline has been forced to cancel thousands of flights as it attempts to bring its schedule under control, 
and the CAA is concerned that passengers are not being given all the information they are due.
Several carriers – among them Emirates, American Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Etihad Airways and Singapore Airlines 
– have previously faced similar enforcement action by the CAA for denying compensation to passengers.

So the bloke in charge of strategy at Ryanair was doing the holiday rota. And he made a "boo boo" in Michael 
O'Leary's own words.
Now Ryanair is "eliminating all management distractions", including abandoning its interest in Alitalia, the Italian 
carrier. It is confirmation that Ryanair is a one man show, if anyone didn't know. As oil prices rise, it may be no bad 
thing that Ryanair is abandoning Alitalia. But as well as hiring pilots and lifting their pay, Ryanair is putting a Chief 
People Officer in charge of recruiting pros to sort the holiday roster.
The bill for cancelling flights affecting 700,000 or so passengers is expected to be up to (EURO)50m. That alone 
won't dent full-year profits of close to (EURO)1.45bn. Nonetheless, Ryanairs' non-fuel costs are taking off, which is 
an uncomfortable direction of travel for a low-cost airline.

March 2018, affecting some 400,000 customers who have already booked flights.
Under the airline's slower growth plan, some 18,000 of the airline's 800,000 annual flights will be cancelled. The 
airline described the measure as cancelling less than one flight per day per airport across 200 airports.
Ryanair had earlier this month said it would cancel 2,100 flights through October because it "messed up" the 
allocation of pilots' annual leave as it shifts to a new scheduling system.
"We sincerely apologize to those customers who have been affected by last week's flight cancellations, or these 
sensible schedule changes announced today," CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
The routes canceled include London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Gatwick to Belfast, Newcastle to Faro, 
and Glasgow to Las Palmas.
Though over 99 percent of the airline's 129 million customers will not be affected, O'Leary said "we deeply regret 
any doubt we caused existing customers last week about Ryanair's reliability, or the risk of further cancellations."
The airline said that reducing its fleet and slowing its growth will create spare aircraft and crew in order to manage 
"exceptional volumes of annual leave," as it shifted to a new scheduling system.
European safety regulations that take effect Jan. 1 and require all airlines to use a regular calendar year for 
calculating pilot flight hours and working days. Ryanair has until now used a 12-month period beginning April 1. 
Critics have suggested that the system gave the airline a competitive advantage in scheduling pilots during the busy 
summer season because hours accumulated from January to March didn't carry over into the new scheduling year.
Ryanair cancels more flights, affecting 400,000 customers
The company also says it has scrapped plans to bid for bankrupt Italian airline Alitalia to focus on addressing its 
own problems.

 Ryanair (RYAAY), Europe's largest budget airline, said on Wednesday it will cancel about 18,000 flights over the 
five-month winter period to cut its growth rate to 4% from an earlier envisaged 9%.
The airline, which cancelled 2,100 flights on Sept. 18 citing problems related to the rostering of annual leave for 
pilots, said it seeks to eliminate all risk of further flight cancellations with the winter timetable changes. It said it aims 
to roster all of the extra pilot leave necessary in October, November and December to meet the Irish Aviation 
Authority's requirement to complete a nine month annual leave transition period so that Ryanair starts a new 
calendar leave year from Jan. 1 with no backlog.
The customers affected were notified by the company of the schedule changes, offering them alternative flights or 
full refunds of their airfare. They have also received a travel voucher for EUR40 ($47), and EUR80 on return flights, 
which will allow them to book during October a flight on any Ryanair service between October and March 2018.
The company is also compensating the 315,000 customers whose flights were canceled over a six-week period in 
September and October, offering them an EUR40 travel voucher (EUR80 return) for travel between October and 
March 2018. This flight voucher is in addition to the flight re-accommodation/refunds they received last week, and 
applicable to the compensation which they may claim and receive over the coming weeks.
The total cost of the flight cancellations last week should be under EUR25 million, the company said, with the cost 
of the free flight vouchers issued today to affected customers also coming in at less than EUR25 million.
It sees slightly lower yields over the next two months as it cuts prices as a promotion. 
The company will now carry over 129 million customers in the year to March 2018, rather than the previously 
estimated 131 million,  and in the year to March 2019 growth will slow to 138 million customers from 142 million. 
Ryanair to Cancel 18,000 Flights From Nov. to March; Cuts Traffic Forecast, Reiterates FY Profit After Tax 
Outlook
It reiterated its current fiscal year forecast of between EUR1.40 billion and to EUR1.45 billion for profit after tax and 
pledged to provide a full update on these issues to shareholders during the half-year results in late October.
American depository shares were 2.8% higher in early afternoon on Wednesday.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) confirmed it will slow its growth this winter (November 2017 to 
March 2018), by flying 25 less aircraft (of its 400 fleet) from November, and 10 fewer aircraft (of 445) from April 
2018. By reducing its flying schedule, Ryanair will: eliminate all risk of further flight cancellations, and roster all of 
the extra pilot leave necessary in Oct, Nov and Dec to meet the IAA's requirement to complete a 9 month annual 
leave transition period.  Ryanair said the slower rate of growth will slightly reduce traffic in the current year and next. 
The monthly growth from November 17 to March 18 will slow from 9% to 4%. Full-year traffic of 131 million will now 
moderate to 129 million, which is 7.5% up on last year. 
The company expects traffic to March 2019 will slow to 138 million from 142 million, a 7% rate of growth.  Ryanair 
said it does not expect the initiatives to alter its current year guidance of between 1.40 to 1.45 billion euros profit 
after tax. The company will provide a full update on these issues to shareholders during the half year results in late 
October.  Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 'From today, there will be no more rostering related flight cancellations 
this winter or in summer 2018. Slower growth this winter, will create lots of spare aircraft and crews which will allow 
us to manage the exceptional volumes of annual leave we committed to delivering in the 9 months to Dec 2017. We 
will start a new 12 month leave period on the 1st of Jan 2018 in full compliance with EU regulations and the IAA's 
requirements.'  Ryanair also said it has notified the Alitalia bankruptcy Commissioners that the company will not be 
pursuing its interest in Alitalia or submitting any further offers for the airline.

Ryanair will this winter operate 25 fewer aircraft than the 400 it previously planned to, and has cancelled some 
18,000 flights across the season, suspending 34 routes, as it seeks to avoid further disruption arising from lack of 
available pilots.
The budget carrier says the cancellations in the November-March period will affect "less than 400,000 customers". 
These have been contacted today with an offer of alternative flights or refunds along with a 40 (80 return) travel 
voucher that can be used from October to book a Ryanair flight in the period through March 2018.
This same voucher has also been offered to the 315,000 customers affected by flight cancellations across a six-
week period in September-October, as an addition to "reaccommodation/refunds" already received and forthcoming 
EU261 compensation.
"Slower growth creates lots of spare aircraft and crews across Ryanair's 86 bases this winter," says the airline, 
which intends to "roster all of the extra pilot leave necessary in October, November and December" to complete a 
nine-month annual-leave transition period and then start the new calendar year without a backlog of holidays.
From April 2018, Ryanair will operate 435 aircraft rather than 445.
To remove the risk of "roster problems" next year, the airline will require that 40% of the annual pilot leave 
requirement be taken in the first quarter.
Its forecast for passengers carried in the year ending 31 March 2018 has been reduced by two million to 129 
million. The figure for the following year has been cut by four million to 138 million.
Ryanair cancels 18,000 winter flights Ryanair will this winter operate 25 fewer aircraft than the 400 it previously 
planned to, and has cancelled some 18,000 fl....
The airline expects its full-year profit-after-tax forecast of 1.4-1.45 billion ($1.6-1.7 billion) to remain unchanged. It 
adds: "Over the next two years, as Ryanair hires more pilots and raises pilot pay, costs will rise slightly, but we don't 
believe this will impact profitability."

NMC Health was the FTSE 100's biggest gainer yesterday after HSBC forecast the Middle East hospital operator 
would step up its overseas expansion.
NMC's balance sheet can support about $1.3bn of acquisitions by the end of 2018 without raising more cash, 
HSBC forecast. Picking out Egypt, Bahrain and Qatar as potential territories, its team expected NMC to focus on 
"countries where healthcare spend is taking off but infrastructure is still behind the country's need, similar to where 
the UAE was a decade ago".
HSBC put a £32 target on NMC, which climbed 2.8 per cent to £27.18.
The wider market remained calm, leaving the FTSE 100 0.2 per cent lower, off just 15.55 points at 7,285.74. British 
American Tobacco gained 1.4 per cent to £46.50 after US broker Cowan upgraded to "outperform" with a £53.50 
target. Cowen was also positive on Imperial Brands, which took on 1.5 per cent to £32.75.
Trading at less than 12 times earnings, Imperial is at a deep discount to global peers in spite of its sector-leading 
margins and scope for further portfolio streamlining, Cowen said.
Separately, retail sales data showed both BAT and Imperial gaining market share in the UK over August.
Carnival, the world's biggest cruiseship operator, rose 2.7 per cent to £48.65 on better than expected quarterly 
earnings and unchanged guidance for the full year.
London NMC Health makes strides on overseas expansion talk
EasyJet gained 1.6 per cent to £11.99 a day before an investor meeting, where the airline is expected to give some 
colour to its bid for Air Berlin slots and the effects on recent trading from Ryanair's flight cancellations.
Advertising agency WPP was 1.7 per cent lower at £13.99 on a downgrade to "equal weight" from Morgan Stanley.
It forecast WPP to miss sales growth targets this year and deliver a gain of just 0.5 per cent in 2018, citing low GDP 
growth and marketing budget cuts among the fast-moving consumer goods makers. Morgan Stanley also cited 
"price indiscipline" among competing agencies as well as "client distrust" of the industry, particularly on media 
buying margins.
Vedanta Resources rose 4 per cent to 835p after Canaccord Genuity upgraded it to "speculative buy" from "hold". 
Rolling commodity price forecasts into 2018 gave Canaccord a 940p target for Vedanta, up from 400p, though the 
broker cautioned that its buy advice was "on a trading basis" due to the stock's volatility and the likelihood of no 
debt reduction before 2019.
Card Factory dropped 18.3 per cent to 290p after switching its focus from paying special dividends to keeping debt 
under control. The retailer also cut year-end margin guidance to reflect rising costs and a growing reliance on lower 
margin non-card products.

Budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday said it will cut 25 planes, or 6 per cent of its fleet, this winter as it slows its 
planned growth following the recent chaos caused by too many pilots taking annual leave at once.
"We plan to grow more slowly - 4 per cent instead of 9 per cent - this winter by flying fewer of our 400 aircraft 
between November and March 2018," the airline said.
"Ryanair has grown rapidly over 30 years to carry 129 million customers per annum, more than any other EU 
airline," it said.
"However, it suffered a roster failure in September because it has over-allocated months of pilot annual leave 
during the four months from September to December."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, apologized to passengers affected by scores of flight cancellations last 
week.
"From today, there will be no more rostering-related flight cancellations this winter or in summer 2018," O'Leary 
said.
"Slower growth this winter will create lots of spare aircraft and crews, which will allow us to manage the exceptional 
volumes of annual leave we committed to delivering in the nine months to December 2017."

CONSUMER group Which? said today it has written to regulators over Ryanair's handling of a six-week wave of 
flight cancellations, seeking enforcement action after the airline provided "woefully short" information to customers.
The airline has cancelled over 2,000 flights over a six-week period across September and October, due to 
mismanagement of pilot holidays.
Which? said it has told the Civil Aviation Authority that Ryanair needed to improve issues such as informing 
passengers of their rights under EU regulations, or face action.
Ryanair said on Monday that the vast majority of the 315,000 affected passengers had contacted the airline for 
refund and rebooking options.
Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said the airline had also expanded its customer service team to help 
customers affected.

DESPITE its IT troubles earlier this year, strike troubles, and complaints over its move to charge for in-flight food on 
some flights, British Airways has not felt the wrath of customer dissatisfaction yet.
According to new research from software firm Clarabridge, the carrier comes up top for passenger satisfaction in a 
ranking of 16 airlines for customer satisfaction, nudging past Easyjet and Virgin to take the top spot. Ryanair came 
in fourth of the 16 airlines listed, though the research was carried out before the recent troubles for the airline with 
mass flight cancellations.
A quarter of the 2,491 passengers surveyed said they had no particular loyalty to an airline at all.
The study also found that nearly three-quarters of people do not bother complaining to airlines as they do not think 
they will be listened to.
In terms of what factors prompt passengers to opt for one airline over another, 60 per cent said price and flight 
times were key, though 80 per cent said they would recommend carriers on staff friendliness, as well as easy 
procedures.

RYANAIR said yesterday that while the vast majority of the 315,000 passengers affected by its wave of flight 
cancellations have contacted the airline for refund options, thousands are still yet to do so.
The airline, which announced a batch of cancellations over six weeks across September and October due to the 
mismanagement of pilot holiday leave, said that all the affected customers received email information last Monday 
18 September.
By Sunday 24 September, over 305,000 alternative routings or refunds had been processed. The carrier said three 
per cent of customers were yet to contact Ryanair.
The airline's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: "More than 97 per cent of affected customers have now 
been re-accommodated, and the remaining three per cent (less than 10,000 customers) are urged to get in contact 
regarding their rebooking or refunding options."
Jacobs also apologised again for the disruption to passengers and said Ryanair had expanded its customer service 
team.

Ryanair says it lacks enough standby pilots for coming months

Ryanair blames an internal "cock up," but its cancellation of 2,000 flights exposes the struggle that low-cost carriers 
face as they risk growing faster than their ability to recruit experienced pilots.
Junior pilots are readily available, with hundreds unemployed in Britain alone, but Europe's budget airlines require 
many extra captains who can take flights without needing lengthy and expensive training, or to accumulate flying 
hours.
Ireland's Ryanair, which has overtaken established carriers to become Europe's biggest airline by passenger 
numbers, is hiring around 600 pilots this year, as is Norwegian Air Shuttle. For British-based easyJet the figure is 
450 and in all cases these are their highest ever levels of pilot recruitment.
"The low cost airlines are arguably more vulnerable to a pilot shortage because of their growth, which is now 
compounded by their size," said Gerald Khoo, an analyst with Liberum.
"Normally, in a tight labor market I would assume slightly higher staff costs or the airline could trim its capacity 
growth," he said. "Not getting the balance right results in the situation we have seen atRyanair in the past week."
Ryanair has disrupted plans for hundreds of thousands of travelers with the cancellations this month due to the pilot 
shortage.
The carrier put its problems down to too many pilots taking leave at the same time. But the shortages are being felt 
across an industry where the budget airlines are flying tens of millions more passengers each year, driving an 
increase in European short-haul capacity of around seven percent.
Ryanair says it lacks enough standby pilots for coming months
Norwegian is particularly jostling Ryanair for senior talent. Both have Boeing fleets, meaning that when pilots defect 
they fly similar aircraft, lessening training time and expense. Norwegian says it has poached more than 140 pilots 
from Ryanair; Dublin-based Ryanair puts the number at less than 100.
Ryanair is increasing wages for its pilots based in Frankfurt and Berlin in order to steal staff from Air Berlin, even 
though the insolvent German carrier flies Airbus jets rather than Boeings, making this a more expensive exercise.
Lufthansa's budget unit Eurowings is also making a bid for Air Berlin's experienced pilots.
Mark Simpson, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers, said he didn't see a significant risk thatRyanair would have 
to curb its expansion plans. "This is a pinch they are facing," he said. "But it hasn't reached a crisis point."
Aside from Air Berlin, Italy's Alitalia, Latvia's Air Baltic and Romania's Tarom were all struggling and could to shed 
pilots, easing the shortage, he added.
The pressure is being felt acutely in senior roles, according to the British Airline Pilots' Association, which says 
around 500 of its more junior members are unemployed.
"We've seen huge recruitment drives .... in recent years. However, this recruitment tends to be for experienced 
pilots," said BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton.
Recruitment web site Indeed.com said pilot vacancies in Britain were 60 percent harder to fill than other jobs, as 
measured by the number of positions still vacant after 60 days.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said captains have been targeted since the cancellations with a 10,000 euro sign-on 
bonus. "We may have got pilot pay a little on the low side," he told investors at Ryanair's annual general meeting 
this week.
He insisted the problems were localized and that certain parts of Europe had a surplus of experienced pilots.
Ryanair this week also announced wage increases in Dublin, where it says it believes Norwegian Air is trying to hire 
40 of its pilots, and in London where it says pilots are being targeted by a number of rivals.
A spokesman for Norwegian Air said it saw significant competition for pilots, but was offering competitive conditions 
and the prospect of flying to destinations in southeast Asia and the United States that Ryanair could not match.
EasyJet declined to comment on whether it was struggling to attract senior pilots.
Ryanair is widely regarded to pay competitive wages to senior pilots. Captains earn 150,000-180,000 euros a year, 
while first officers get 80,000-120,000. But it has been criticized by some current and former staff about working 
conditions and the way the blunt-speaking O'Leary talks about his staff.
Pilots are often employed via agencies and do not enjoy standard benefits for sick pay, pensions or health 
insurance.
O'Leary insisted at the AGM he had a good relationship with his pilots, but said: "I would challenge any pilot to 
explain how this is a difficult job," expressing doubt that anyone could be fatigued after what he said was a 
maximum of 18 hours of flying per week.
Ryanair gets a rating of 2.4 on employee-review site Glassdoor, against 4.0 for easyJet.
Four years ago Ryanair was berated by investors for treating its customers badly, forcing a promise from O'Leary to 
stop "unnecessarily pissing people off" and launching its successful Always Getting Better customer service drive.
But unlike the current crisis, poor customer service never threatened the airline's core operations. Investors remain 
skittish, with its shares down 5.5 percent since the crisis broke to close at 16.44 euros on Friday.
Ryanair says it lacks enough standby pilots for coming months
There are signs that pilots are using the shortage to assert themselves. While Ryanair doesn't recognize trade 
unions, staff at a number of bases wrote a joint letter to management with a series of demands including the 
implementation of permanent local contracts under local employment law.
The European Cockpit Association said Ryanair may now have to treat its staff better as well as its customers.
"The Always Getting Better program could have been applied to staff too," ECA Secretary General Philip von 
Scho&ouml;ppenthau told Reuters. "It would certainly be welcomed by the crew and contribute to the success of 
the company." (Reuters)

'Biblical' ETFs that exclude LGBT backers miss fundraising goal Non-LGBT ETFs miss fundraising goal

Two passive funds that exclude companies supportive of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community 
have raised $70m since their launch in March, far below their initial target.
Inspire Investing had expected the "biblically responsible" products aimed at conservative evangelical Christians to 
attract "hundreds of millions of dollars" in the months since their launch in February. By September 21 they had 
combined assets of just under $70m.
"While these ETFs were set up to appeal to investors with specific values, there's likely to be a significantly larger 
market for investment strategies and products based on LGBT inclusion, rather than exclusion," said Howard 
Sherman, head of corporate governance business development at MSCI, the index provider. Inspire Investing also 
launched a biblically responsible corporate bond fund two months ago, which has assets of $20m.
"Our asset gathering is going according to plan and we believe, God willing, that our ETFs will attract assets in the 
hundreds of millions," Robert Netzly, chief executive of the US investment group, said.
"Demand for biblically responsible ETFs is proving to be robust and we are running to keep up. These AUM levels 
put us among the most successful ETF launches of the year."
The ETFs have invested in companies including Panera Bread, the US bakery and sandwich chain, Germany's 
Commerzbank and Ryanair, the Irish airline.
'Biblical' ETFs that exclude LGBT backers miss fundraising goal Non-LGBT ETFs miss fundraising goal
US investors already have access to a "Catholic Values" ETF, launched in 2016. It excludes S&P 500 members 
that are considered incompatible with church teaching by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, such 
as defence stocks. Inspire Investing's ETFs went further, explicitly screening out stocks of companies that support 
LGBT rights, alongside businesses involved in abortion, gambling, alcohol, pornography and terrorism.
continued on page 2 continued from page 1 The booming global ETF market, which has $4.4tn in assets, has 
spawned numerous thematic products in which stocks are selected according to niche topics such as obesity or 
cyber security. Many are modest in size.
"The [Inspire] assets under management are still small for a new ETF, but not unreasonable," said David 
Stevenson, editor of ETF Stream, the news service, and an FT columnist. He said many new and specialised ETFs 
only pull in around $20m to $30m. "Crucially, this is a big potential market, and hitting a few hundred million within 
six months doesn't seem unreasonable."
The corporate world has increasingly embraced the LGBT cause. Companies such as Apple and Goldman Sachs 
are among the biggest supporters of more inclusive policies. There is evidence that companies that promote 
diversity perform better over time. A basket of 270 companies that embrace pro-LGBT policies outperformed the 
MSCI All Country World index by 3 per cent a year, according to research conducted by Credit Suisse, the bank, 
last year.
The basket was constructed by finding companies that either have openly LGBT leaders and senior management, 
that are voted as leading LGBT employers in surveys by rights groups such as Stonewall, or those that have many 
employees in local LGBT business networks.

'Biblical' ETFs that exclude LGBT backers miss fundraising goal Non-LGBT ETFs miss fundraising goal
US investors already have access to a "CatholicValues"ETF, launched in 2016. It excludes S&P 500 members that 
are considered incompatible with church teaching by the United StatesConference of Catholic Bishops, such as 
defence stocks. Inspire Investing's ETFs went further, explicitly screening out stocks of companies that support 
LGBT rights, alongside businesses involved in abortion, gambling, alcohol,pornographyandterrorism.

spawned numerous thematic products in which stocks are selected according to niche topics such as obesity or 
cyber security. Many are modest in size.
"The [Inspire] assets under management are still small for a new ETF, but not unreasonable," said David 
Stevenson, editor of ETF Stream, the news service, and an FT columnist. He said many new and specialised ETFs 
only pull in around $20m to $30m. "Crucially, this is a big potential market, and hitting a few hundred million within 
six months doesn't seem unreasonable."
The corporate world has increasingly embraced the LGBT cause. Companies such as Apple and Goldman Sachs 
are among the biggest supporters of more inclusive policies. There is evidence that companies that promote 
diversity perform better over time. A basket of 270 companies that embrace pro-LGBT policies outperformed the 
MSCI All Country World index by 3 per cent a year, according to research conducted by Credit Suisse, the bank, 
last year.
The basket was constructed by finding companies that either have openly LGBT leaders and senior management, 
that are voted as leading LGBT employers in surveys by rights groups such as Stonewall, or those that have many 
employees in local LGBT business networks.

Ryanair could open up to 300 connecting options from Bergamo, the Italian airport's commercial aviation director 
Giacomo Cattaneo believes.
The budget carrier began connecting options to 25 of its destinations from Bergamo in July and has since increased 
that figure to 75. But speaking to FlightGlobal at the World Routes conference in Barcelona today, Cattaneo says 
he expects this to more than triple.
"Things are working well now after three months roughly and I guess quite soon they will open up the entire 
possible connectivities with their own routes," he says.
Ryanair currently operates 80 routes from Bergamo during the summer and 70 during the winter and, having 
spoken to the carrier, Cattaneo says he believes "all these are allowed to be combined with one another".
Initially, Cattaneo says, the number of passengers using Ryanair's connecting product could be counted on "one 
hand" in the first month, but it has been doubling every week and is now "three digits a day". He expects that 
ultimately several thousand passengers could use the service.
He says Ryanair has so far pursued a soft approach by only connecting flights with 2.5h between arrival and 
departure times. He expects this will be reduced as the airline gains experience with the product.
One issue that has arisen, Cattaneo says, is that Ryanair does not use "IATA messaging" to identify connecting 
passengers for the airport they were arriving at and so they were "still facing this difficulty of not getting this proper 
message".
ROUTES: Ryanair likely to connect 'entire network' from Bergamo Ryanair could open up to 300 connecting 
options from Bergamo, the Italian airport's commercial a....
He says the connecting product would "absolutely" be of interest to long-haul airlines looking for feed at Bergamo 
and describes his catchment as a "high potential inbound, high potential outbound market", which would appeal to a 
long-haul carrier.
While noting that Ryanair's talks over a long-haul feeder agreement with Norwegian have come to an end, Cattaneo 
suggests that a long-haul feeder arrangement with Aer Lingus from Bergamo could be possible and could, for 
example, involve a passenger flying from Milan to Dublin and then onward to Chicago.

Highlight: Michael O'Leary is nothing if not a savvy businessman, and so it is all the more surprising that he has 
blotted his copybook in recent weeks by failing to plan ahead
Body
Just like me in the early days of Superquinn’s expansion, Michael O’Leary knows a thing or two about how to get 
plenty of free publicity – but it is there that the similarity between us ends!
O’Leary’s preferred method is usually the deployment of snarky, controversial jibes at politicians, regulators and 
government officials. He is nothing if not a savvy businessman, and so it is all the more surprising that he has 
blotted his copybook in recent weeks by failing to plan ahead for the changes that Ryanair needed to make in 
relation to the annual leave arrangements for its staff.
Smart businesses regularly assess their risk landscape and make contingency plans in readiness for the worst, but 
Ryanair seems to have failed spectacularly. With wall-to-wall press coverage of the story across Europe, 
presumably O’Leary is pinning his hopes on the old, tired adage that there is no such thing as bad publicity.
With Ryanair recording profits of €1.3 billion for the year ending March 2017, the €20 million cost of this gaffe is 
unlikely to hit the bottom line too badly. But will it dent Ryanair’s customer loyalty?
The low air fares revolution has made air travel so much more affordable than in the past. In the 1980s, a return 
flight from Dublin to London might have cost in the region of £200. Now we can take the same flight for a small 
fraction of that cost. We mainly have a colourful Tipperary man named Tony Ryan to thank for this.
In recent years, Ryanair has very much become the airline equivalent of a “pile ‘em high, sell ‘em cheap” shop. It 
has broken down the various elements of air travel and has commoditised them, selling us a low-price basic ticket 
and then charging for everything from the printing of your boarding pass, to the bag in the hold, to the seat you 
select.
Quinn on the brand
Complain as people might, they still flock to Ryanair in their millions - in fact, last year, Ryanair carried 117 million 
passengers making it Europe’s biggest airline (in terms of passenger numbers). If love can be measured in ticket 
sales and euro, people right across Europe love Ryanair.
But while I accept that people recognise and appreciate value for money, it is somewhat intriguing that a company 
such as Ryanair can achieve great levels of success. Let’s just say that it is not a firm renowned for holding its 
customers in very high esteem.
This is in stark contrast with the philosophy that we ingrained in all our staff at Superquinn. That philosophy is 
captured in a book that I wrote many years ago, called Crowning The Customer. In it, I effectively revealed the 
recipe for Superquinn’s secret sauce – it was all about attending to the needs of our customers. Everything we did 
was viewed through that prism. We desperately wanted our customers to return time and again so we needed to 
ensure that they had a pleasant experience, that they felt listened to and that they felt valued. Seeing customers as 
people, not an irritant, was crucial.
We quickly learned that effective handling of customer complaints was a great means of strengthening the loyalty of 
each of those customers. Normally, a satisfied customer who makes a complaint which is handled well ends up 
more satisfied than they were before. Ryanair has yet to learn this.
I was somewhat sceptical when, at the end of 2013, O’Leary announced his Pauline conversion to the cause of the 
customer! In fairness, he delivered on some aspects of this – customer service has improved. But I don’t think that 
the supposedly cuddly, customer-loving Ryanair ever actually materialised.
Ryanair’s handling of the latest series of flight cancellations is a real test of its customer service ethos. Looking at 
the reportage, there are a lot of people who are angry with the airline, many of whom feel that they have been badly 
treated.
I occasionally fly with Ryanair. It is not exactly a pleasant experience, but I fly with it because it gets me to where I 
need to go. Sadly for the 300,000 or so people affected by the latest controversy, Ryanair has failed them in the 
one thing that it used to do well – getting people where they need to go at a low fare (and usually on time too).
In short, Ryanair has let its customers down badly; it has breached their trust. And it would be foolhardy to think that 
the longer-term consequences of this for Ryanair is confined to the 300,000 people directly affected. Will the repeat 
flyers return in their droves to avail of Ryanair’s flights? Most of them probably will because, in the words of O’Leary 
himself in 2013: “People will still put up with almost any amount of irritation.” But they deserve better, even from a 
“no-frills” airline.
When I was chairman of An Post, I was invited by Tony Ryan to become a member of the board of Ryanair. 
Unfortunately, I had to decline, due to other commitments. While the impact of one board member can be limited, 
I’d like to think that I would have brought the Superquinn flair for a great customer experience to Ryanair.
While it was by no means easy, at Superquinn we successfully combined best-in-class customer service with a 
value-for-money offering. Imagine the heights that Ryanair could scale if it combined its low fares with a dedication 
to a positive customer experience. Most people I know who fly with Ryanair do so grudgingly. They have no love for 
the brand, the queues, the boarding stampede, the jaded cabin crew or the hard sell onboard, but they fly with 
Ryanair for the low fares.
The Ryanair business model has focused on fares almost to the exclusion of every other aspect of the service that 
it provides. Ryanair has yet to realise that it is possible to deliver low fares while still caring about its customers.

Ten days that shook a €20 billion behemoth

Highlight: As Ryanair licks its wounds from the biggest PR disaster in its history, it knows that all its good work in 
recent years is at huge risk of being undone 
Body
First off, let’s be clear that Michael O’Leary has been the outstanding chief executive not just of this generation, but 
arguably of any Irish company. The achievements of Michael Smurfit, Tony O’Reilly and Denis O’Brien do not 
match what O’Leary has done with Ryanair. The airline is what it is today not because of Tony Ryan, but because 
of O’Leary and his unyielding belief in low fares and low costs.
Ryanair is a €20 billion behemoth. As I recount elsewhere in this newspaper today, the size of it is simply 
staggering. It carries more passengers in a single month than Aer Lingus will in an entire year. It has also achieved 
something unusual in aviation - it has made profits year in, year out, in good times and bad.
More than that, it has brought the price of air travel down to the cost of a bus or train journey and opened up 
European countries to tourism riches they never thought possible.
The last ten days, however, have been nothing short of a disaster for Ryanair. Its mass cancellation of flights has 
been described many times over as a public relations and consumer catastrophe.
O’Leary has been a genius at generating free publicity. He has gone to many lengths with PR stunts, including 
dressing up as the Pope to launch routes in Italy and hiring a tank (to park on Easyjet’s lawn and highlight his war 
on high fares, in case you were wondering). But the events of the last week or so are not just a PR failing. They 
have also been something we have never witnessed from Ryanair before, and certainly not in the last few years of 
its new, customer-friendly image: an operational disaster, one which I’m not sure the airline has fully grasped.
The whole point of Ryanair has been to carry passengers from point A to point B at low expense. Cancelling 2 per 
cent of the airline’s flights over a six-week period will inconvenience and irk more than 300,000 passengers and 
cost it €25 million, at least, in the short term.
Ten days that shook a €20 billion behemoth
I had a conversation this weekend with someone who had extensive dealings with O’Leary and the Ryanair 
management team for more than a decade. When Ryanair worked well, which it did more than 90 per cent of the 
time, it worked really well. However, when things went wrong, there was no flexibility in the system to cope with the 
passenger who really needed to get a flight, and who really needed Ryanair’s staff to make an exception to the 
rules. O’Leary, the source told me, simply wouldn’t budge, insisting that cheap fares were all that mattered.
It was that tough image that eventually counted against Ryanair: the fact that it could almost be perceived as a 
nasty company. Ryanair did change. You cannot fail to notice its "always getting better" slogan in any airport across 
Europe. And it is more than just branding. The customer service changes have noticeably improved its service.
O’Leary faced his shareholders on Thursday morning at the company’s annual general meeting. For about half an 
hour, he was easily able to deal with their questions, even from the investor who was concerned that O’Leary’s own 
gung-ho image and management style were going to cause more reputational damage. He assured the shareholder 
it wouldn’t happen.
For about an hour after the agm, O’Leary held court with the media from Ireland and abroad. All week, rumours had 
been circulating that the shortage of pilots, the reason for the flight cancellations, was because they were leaving 
the airline in droves, unhappy with their pay and conditions. O’Leary dismissed this as unions looking to muscle in 
on Ryanair, and said hell would freeze over before the airline would allow unionisation.
When I asked O’Leary if he respected pilots, he responded by saying that everybody respected their skills and 
professionalism, before going on to say that there were very well-paid and had easy working conditions. He added 
for good measure that once planes were up in the air, the autopilot system did most of the flying. It was an 
extraordinary comment to make, at a time when the goodwill of pilots is required to alleviate Ryanair's current crisis.
The airline is growing at an incredible rate. Passenger numbers this year will hit 131 million, up from 120 million. 
New airports and routes are being added all the time, and hundreds of new planes are on order. Ryanair insists it 
can manage this growth and still reduce average fares.
Ryanair's share price peaked at €19.38 in August, just days after the airline announced record quarterly revenues, 
profits and passenger numbers. Since then they have fallen, closing at €16.45 on Friday. Is this a sign that 
investors have concerns, or are they simply taking profits after big gains this year?
I asked O’Leary if there was something more fundamental changing in the business, whether the cancellations were 
a sign of wider issues. He told me to calm down!
He insisted that the flight cancellations would be dealt with, and that if pay was a matter for pilots at some airports, it 
would be addressed and no long-term damage had been done.
Ryanair and Michael O’Leary are inextricably linked. O'Leary's management style has made Ryanair what it is 
today. But the bigger a company gets and the faster it grows, the more new operational challenges it faces which 
sometimes require a different approach. If Ryanair can’t quickly get on top of its problems, all of the recent good 
work it has done to burnish its image will be undone.

Highlight: The most successful airline in Europe, if not the world, is facing a crisis
Body
Someone is desperate to give Michael O’Leary a bloody nose. But just who is it? After all, who would want to take 
on the combative motormouth billionaire who runs the biggest airline in Europe?
As he paces the top floor of the company’s head office in Swords in north Dublin, addressing a small group of 
shareholders early on Thursday morning, O’Leary is clear who is out to get him. It is not one group, but many. 
http://businesspost.ie/398618. Upstart competitors stealing his employees. The media. And his decades-long bête 
noire – airline unions. They are all out to add to one of the most calamitous weeks in the airline’s history.
More than 300,000 customers have been told that their flights have been cancelled and their holiday plans ruined. 
The company is facing an enormous PR and consumer backlash across Europe, along with a €25 million bill for 
compensation. Investors are rattled, customers irate. Relations between pilots and O’Leary have hit a low point, 
with the threat of an industrial relations backlash unless there are sweeping changes.
The most successful airline in Europe, if not the world, is facing a crisis. But it raises some fundamental questions, 
about tightening of crewing schedules, and the poor systems of managing flight disruptions. Just how did Ryanair 
make such a colossal mistake? Was it a simple error, or a manifestation of a more structural problem?
Cock-up. Mess-up. Fuck-up. That’s how the airline described the problem that has led to 50 flights per day across 
Europe being cancelled for the next six weeks. It had simply underestimated how many pilots it would need to have 
available over the next number of weeks.
Instead of having 150 to 200 pilots on standby every day through September and October to ensure it can operate 
all its flights, the number is down to dozens. That is because its cockpit staff can take their annual leave in four-
week blocks and usually do so in September, October and November. Instead of seeing its much-vaunted 
punctuality statistic tumble by causing delays for millions of passengers, it would inconvenience hundreds of 
thousands.
The week Michael O’Leary fell to earth
In the world according to Ryanair, there was no dispute with pilots over pay. There was no haemorrhaging of staff to 
competitors, either. This was a temporary issue that would be addressed without causing lasting damage to 
Ryanair’s new shiny customer-friendly image, O’Leary said.
But Ryanair is no longer the cheeky and ruthlessly effective Irish upstart O’Leary created. In 2008, the airline 
carried 51 million passengers. By 2013, that number reached 80 million. The 100 million barrier was passed in 
2016. In the financial year through to the end of March 2018, that figure will top 130 million. According to the 
airline’s forecasts, it will carry 150 million by 2020 and 200 million by 2024.
Has Ryanair simply become too big to control?
It has 430 aircraft (with another 200-plus planes due to be delivered to it in the coming years), flying 1,800 routes to 
205 airports in 33 different countries. That is a monstrous logistics business to run on a daily basis.
“Our traffic this year is up 11 per cent. Our share price year-to-date is up 15, 16 per cent. The only thing that is 
down is our fares. The underlying business continues to operate very well,” O’Leary said in response to a question 
posed by this newspaper last week. “You guys [in the media] are all excited, the end of the world is nigh, the 
Ryanair model is fallen asunder. Yeah. We’ll just get on with it, delivering 91 per cent punctuality and we will get 
back to running the business. And you guys will run off and get excited about something else.”
It was classic O’Leary, holding forth for almost an hour with media from Ireland and abroad. But throughout it all, he 
insisted – even in the face of multiple reports about pilots rejecting offers of a €12,000 bonus to ease the current 
crisis and €10,000 pay hikes – that all was fine.
If there is anything that has marked out Ryanair’s success, it has been the ability to constantly cut its prices to 
attract passengers. There are a few ways an airline can do it. Good deals with airports on charges is one, and 
Ryanair is extremely good at that. Lowering its own costs is another. Ryanair is good at that too.
According to Ryanair, its average fare this year is about €41. The average at Easyjet is €77, Norwegian’s is €78 
and IAG (owner of Aer Lingus, BA and Iberia) is €198. Out of that €41 average Ryanair fare, staff costs were €5, 
the lowest of the handful of airlines it compares itself to. At Norwegian, staff costs were equivalent to €15 out of its 
average fare. Has Ryanair squeezed its payroll costs so much that pilots are deciding to leave?
Ryanair is a hard-working environment and culture, in a business where low costs are its unique selling point. After 
all, a low cost airline has to be, by definition, tight on the cost base. It has to be. The one group that was, and has 
been, immune to that is pilots. Their hours and working conditions are strictly regulated.
[caption id="attachment_398570" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Michael O’Leary addresses a shareholder 
meeting at Ryanair HQ in Swords, Co Dublin, last weekBarry Cronin[/caption]
“If you sit in the cockpit of a plane flying at 400, 500 miles an hour going in through landing in 40, 50 feet of visibility, 
you have untold respect for pilots,” O’Leary said in response to questions about his relationship with pilots.
“That doesn’t mean they don’t do a very easy job, and they are very well paid for doing what is an easy job. We are 
in an era now where the computer does most of the flying. They are no longer doing the flying themselves. But they 
are very skilled professionals. They do a very skilled job and . . . where our pilots demonstrate that skill is landing in 
thunderstorms or fog.
“But are they hard-working? No. Are 900 hours a year or 18 hours a week, on average, likely to generate fatigue? 
No. But you cannot fail but to respect and admire the professionalism of not just Ryanair’s pilots, but all commercial 
pilots.”
Regardless of that, he said Ryanair would seek to use its contractual right to ask them to work through some of 
their holidays to relieve the current shortage. And if they didn’t comply, the “goodies” he was waving could be easily 
taken off the table.
The week Michael O’Leary fell to earth
But the carrot of extra pay doesn’t seem to be working. Rival airlines are tempting pilots to switch allegiances. A 
large number are jumping ship – or, rather, plane.
An airline looking to disrupt the world of travel, dominated by legacy companies with bloated and heavily unionised 
workforces, offering to fly customers close to major destinations for low fares and offering very little by way of frills 
for free. Sounds familiar? Well that is the model of Norwegian, which is shaking up transatlantic travel by offering 
one-way fares to New York and Boston for well under €200.
Bjørn Kjos, a former Norwegian air force pilot turned businessman, is very much in the O’Leary mould. In fact, until 
last week, the two airlines were in discussions about a tie-up that would be mutually beneficial, allowing passengers 
to connect on each other’s flights.
But to expand Norwegian’s services (and Ireland is at the heart of it, as that’s where the airline has secured its 
licence to fly to the US), Kjos needs pilots to fly his jets to the States. And which airline happens to have a 
substantial number of captains and first officers with thousands of flying hours on Boeing jets? Ryanair.
Norwegian is seeking 40 pilots for its routes out of Dublin alone. Ryanair has 360 pilots based at Dublin Airport. It’s 
easy hunting ground. Where would a pilot rather fly? Stansted a couple of times a day, or a trip to New York or 
Boston with a day off in between the return leg?
O’Leary was adamant that the numbers leaving to join Norwegian were much smaller than the 140 the 
Scandinavian company has claimed. And besides, as he was quick to point out, Norwegian has its own concerns. 
In recent weeks, he has repeatedly questioned whether it has the finances to pay for the huge jet order it has 
placed with Boeing and Airbus. He also mused on whether the airline would even be around in a year.
“That’s just nonsense,” Kjos told Bloomberg in response last Thursday. “This is Michael O’Leary’s style. He likes to 
project headlines. I don’t have any dispute with Ryanair.”
But it’s a handy distraction to shift the attention from the crisis of the last week.
Ryanair has gone through a number of milestones in its history. When the late founder Tony Ryan realised that his 
fledgling airline would go bust very quickly if something didn’t change, he adopted the low-cost strategy, aped from 
Southwest Airlines in the US. It was the saving and the making of the company. Under O’Leary, and key lieutenants 
like Michael Cawley and Howard Millar, suddenly the Ryanair that we know today was born. It got passengers to 
their destinations (or near enough to them) cheaply, and you got very little extra.
In his 2013 biography of the Ryanair founder, historian Richard Aldous tells a story of the concerns Ryan had about 
his protégé. Was the image – cheap with no frills, and when something went wrong you were on your own – 
actually doing more harm than good?
That same year, Ryanair did change. The ‘always getting better’ plan was introduced. Here was the new Ryanair. 
You got the same low fare, but also frills. Pick your seat online, group bookings, two carry-on bags, and more 
besides. Good customer service was also, of course, extremely profitable. A net profit of €1.2 billion in the 2016 
financial year, €1.3 billion in 2017 and a forecast of about €1.4 billion this year. Those are extraordinary figures in a 
volatile business.
Ryanair has been consistently profitable in an industry where companies are more likely to go bankrupt than ever 
pay a dividend. Airlines are hugely difficult businesses to run. The capital required is enormous (the average jet will 
set you back €30 million). You are at the mercy of commodities - oil was once above $150 a barrel - and fickle 
consumers whose demands change with economic circumstances. Already this year, Air Berlin has gone bust and 
Alitalia is facing a similar fate. In that environment, Ryanair has stood out as being not just profitable, but fabulously 
so.
O’Leary has been doing his utmost to project the cancellations faced by passengers in the coming weeks as a one-
off unforeseen event that can be resolved. There is no pilot crisis. There is no bad blood in the airline, and there is 
The week Michael O’Leary fell to earth
nothing endangering its growth plans. He is personally handling the issue, with 8am daily meetings to ensure 
smooth flight operations.
The nice-guy image has suited Michael O’Leary. But is it beginning to wear off already?

Highlight: Captain Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger says he has been 'disgusted and very concerned' for years by the 
tactics used by some low-cost airlines 
Body
The hero pilot responsible for the so-called ‘Miracle on the Hudson’ has come out in support of Ryanair pilots in 
their battle with Michael O’Leary.
Captain Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson river in New York after it struck 
a flight of geese on takeoff from LaGuardia Airport in 2009, saving more than 150 lives.
After the incident, which was later turned into a Hollywood blockbuster starring Tom Hanks, Captain Sullenberger 
became an advocate for employment rights for pilots.
Asked for his views on the situation facing Ryanair pilots, Sullenberger told The Sunday Business Post: “For years, 
I have been disgusted and very concerned by the tactics used by some low-cost airlines and the extreme lengths to 
which they go to try to avoid having to comply with labour laws.”
Sullenberger, a fighter pilot for the US Air Force from 1975 to 1980 before he joined Pacific Southwest Airlines, was 
widely praised for his airmanship during the Flight 1549 incident.
[caption id="attachment_398609" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger[/caption]
“Having been a pilot for 50 years, which means I have been a part of aviation for 44 per cent of its entire history, I 
know how important it is that those running airlines understand and act on the great responsibilities they have to 
their passengers and their employees, even when they try to deny they are employees,” he said. Ryanair was this 
month forced to cancel flights after problems emerged with rostering and pilot shortages. It has offered cash 
incentives to pilots to cancel leave in order to improve its roster availability. These have been rejected by many 
pilots as they seek improved employment conditions.
O’Leary last week said that pilots did not have a “difficult job”.

Sullenberger said: “Airline executives should never forget that while pilots make flying incredibly safe and routine, it 
is not easy.
“They should remember that when we go flying in an airliner, what we are really doing is pushing a tube filled with 
people through the upper atmosphere, seven or eight miles above the Earth, at 80 per cent of the speed of sound, 
in a hostile environment with outside air pressure one quarter than at the surface and outside temperatures to 
minus 70 degrees, and we must return it safely to the Earth every time.”

Highlight: Colm Barrington, the former chairman of Aer Lingus, believes that last week shows that there is such a 
thing as being too efficient
Body
Running an airline is a tricky logistical business. And running a low-cost, low-fares, no frills airline is even trickier. If 
anyone knows that, it’s Colm Barrington, the former chairman of Aer Lingus, who was at the centre of a great many 
very public tussles with Ryanair – both boardroom and marketplace – in recent years.
Barrington has been watching Ryanair’s recent pilot staffing problems closely and he believes that last week shows 
that there is such a thing as being too efficient. Michael O’Leary’s airline can often be pared to the bone, he said, 
pointing to 2012 when three flights to Valencia in the same day had to issue maydays because of low fuel loads.
“When everything is as efficient as it can possibly be,” he said, “then when things go wrong there are issues.”Last 
week’s problems with Ryanair’s employment levels, he said, were another example of that trend.“It seems to be a 
major screw-up in industrial relations, or rostering, that they didn’t anticipate.”For Barrington, the controversy is 
likely to trigger a shift in Ryanair’s employment strategy, which he described as “so far out on the extreme that it’s 
unbelievable”, involving hiring pilots through companies effectively as freelancers bound by Irish employment 
law.Referring to the recent European Court of Justice ruling that Ryanair air crew can bring industrial relations 
proceedings against the airline in their home countries.
“It has taken a long time to come through in this case, and that gave them an unfair competitive advantage. We did 
raise it with the EU many years ago but it’s taken until now for the court to give its judgment on that. I presume that 
will be picked up by countries all across Europe.“It’s a case of Icarus, to a certain extent. Fly too close to the sun 
and you'll sometimes get caught.”
Ruxandra Haradau-Doser, an airlines analyst with Kepler Cheuvreux, told The Sunday Business Post that it could 
take Ryanair a while to work through the fallout from the problems this week has highlighted.“I believe that indeed 
there are some question marks with respect to their employment model going forward,” she said, referring to the 
European Court of Justice ruling last week on the manner in which Ryanair employs pilots.
Whyte on the markets
“It’s very difficult to put a number on it at this point. The risk has increased, there will be more claims brought to 
court in different countries in Europe. We’ll have to see how this will develop. Then, probably in every country, there 
will be other legal implications. For example, they have a lot of employees that are freelancers. And what is 
classified as a freelancer in Ireland may not be in another country.
“And this might have implications in terms of the social charges [for Ryanair]. Maybe they’ll have to retrospectively 
pay social charges, which could be quite substantial. At this point, it’s difficult to put a figure on it.”As a 
consequence, Haradau-Doser said, Ryanair’s costs would increase going forward, and it “would have 
consequences for their margins and profitability”.
Alex Patterson, of Investec Securities, agreed that the recent controversy would take a chunk out of the company’s 
profits, but argued that it does not point to a more profound problem with the airline’s operational model.According 
to Patterson, it was more of a result of several different factors bearing down on it to create the perfect storm for 
Ryanair.
“There was the holiday year change [for the pilots], there was weather and the air traffic control strikes, but there 
was also – between 2012 and 2014 – an 18-month period where they had a gap in taking new aircraft, and that 
resulted in a gap in the promotion of experienced first officers,” he said.“In no uncertain terms, it’s part of the picture 
that they’ve run the airline very efficiently, so when they get complications – whether it’s weather or strikes or a 
change to the calendar – they don’t have enough flexibility to manage that without it impacting their operations.”And 
then there’s the not insignificant issue of Norwegian Airlines’ expansion and hiring, which has further hampered 
Ryanair’s ability to get staff quickly when it needs them.
“I think they did not have a lot of spare capacity in terms of crew and pilots,” Patterson said. So while the company 
had a roughly comparable staff retention figure to airlines like EasyJet (around 5 per cent), he pointed to recent 
reports by the pilots group IALPA which suggested that Ryanair's churn – the loss of staff – has gone up in more 
recent times.
In any case, Patterson pointed out that Ryanair will now have to increase their staffing levels, which had been lower 
than the traditional average of six crew members on a 737 aircraft. Ryanair had been running at around 5.1 people 
per jet, which will now have to rise to probably 5.5 people, Patterson said.
“Crudely, that’s a roughly 5 per cent change and it would add around €35 million to their cost base for a full year,” 
he said, which amounts to a fairly small amount and one that could be easily absorbed in a full year’s results.Any 
additional savings, he said, could be made in their marketing budget and by boosting ancillary sales – in short, 
fewer advertisements and more lottery ticket sales.
In spite of that, Patterson believes the company will not be unduly hit when it comes to announcing its full-year 
results. He said he expected the company to achieve net income of about €920 million for the current quarter and 
€1.49 billion for the full year.“We haven’t changed our views. In fact, I had expected to increase my outlook for the 
year, because passenger numbers had been so much stronger than July and August of last year, so I was 
expecting a good year and I upgraded.”
The €25 million costs Ryanair is expecting to occur are split between compensation and pilot incentives, Patterson 
said.The sum is likely to wipe out the upgrade he was planning to factor into his numbers, but it will still leave the 
airline in a position to meet or exceed its own full-year projections.That accounts for this financial year – but what 
about the future and, particularly, the airline’s reputation among its loyal customer base? Surely that’s taken a 
wallop?
Not so, according to Patterson, citing British Airways, which recently suffered a massive dose of bad publicity when 
it moved to Heathrow’s Terminal 5 and ran into some well-publicised technical problems.“BA, which has a more 
positive reputation [than Ryanair], had its IT problems in May and when it moved into Terminal 5 had huge 
problems with the baggage handling,” he said. But all of it faded from the public’s memory after a while.
Whyte on the markets
“This will be temporary. The reason I say that is because, in the first years of the company’s growth, it did 
everything to take advantage of bad publicity, which didn’t seem to stop its growth. Like the British Airways IT 
fiasco, this is a big story today and will be for another week, and then something else will happen and it will 
gradually fall away.”
Colm Barrington agreed. “I think bad airline service is like pain; you forget it as soon as it’s over, and the next time 
people go to their computer, if Ryanair is 30 bucks cheaper, then they’ll book with Ryanair.”
And it’s very likely that Ryanair will attempt to recoup any lost ground with its customers by flogging off a lot of 
cheap flights in the coming months.“The ‘I’ll never travel with Ryanair’ people will once again travel with Ryanair,” 
Barrington said. “People go with Ryanair because of its efficiency and because it offers great fees. This is the first 
time I’m aware of that its efficiency has been shown up.
“Even the decision on the bags – to change from two cabin bags back to one – that’s unlike Ryanair to reverse after 
it found it didn’t work. We’re finding a few glitches in the organisation. Maybe Michael is getting into his dotage.”

Highlight: Ryanair pilots' mood has turned sour following comments by the airline's boss that they had easy jobs 
and were well-paid
Body
Ryanair is facing an avalanche of criticism this weekend, as the consequences of its deepening employment battle 
with its pilots become clear.
In an exclusive interview with The Sunday Business Post this weekend, Captain Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the 
heroic pilot of the US Airways jet that landed safely on the river Hudson in New York in January 2009, hit out at low-
fares airlines over their treatment of staff.
“For years, I have been disgusted and very concerned by the tactics used by some low-cost airlines, and the 
extreme lengths to which they go to try to avoid having to comply with labor laws. I stand with the pilots in their 
struggle for reasonable working conditions,” Sullenberger told this newspaper.
The crisis has wiped some €60 million off O’Leary’s personal wealth.
Many Ryanair pilots have rejected a €10,000 pay hike and a €12,000 bonus, and are digging in against the airline’s 
attempts to hand over some of their annual leave in a bid to extract greater financial concessions and terms from 
the company.
Their mood has turned sour following comments by O’Leary that they had easy jobs and were well-paid.
Ryanair is under pressure to secure the agreement of pilots to give up some of their annual leave to relieve the 
shortfall of available staff. O’Leary’s outburst at a press conference has gone down particularly badly.
Shares in Ryanair have been under pressure for a number of weeks, following a ruling by the European Courts of 
Justice over which country has jurisdiction to deal with its employee disputes and the cancelling of 50 flights a day 
until the end of October.
Pilots dig in at Ryanair after O’Leary’s job jibe
Ruxandra Haradau-Doser, an airlines analyst with Kepler Cheuvreux, said Ryanair would have to change some of 
its employment practices substantially in the wake of the ECJ ruling.
“In our view, the risk has increased and there will be more claims brought to court in different countries in Europe,” 
she said. “We’ll have to see how this will develop. There may be different legal implications in each country. For 
example, they have a lot of employees who are freelancers. And what is classified as a freelancer in Ireland may 
not be in another country.”
The former Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington said the fiasco was an example of the risks of Ryanair’s 
extremely efficient, pared-to-the bone operating model.
“It’s a case of Icarus, to a certain extent,” Barrington said. “Fly too close to the sun and you’ll sometimes get 
caught.”
He said that ultimately the controversy was likely to pass, however, and the airline would continue to lure people 
with its low fares.
“People go with Ryanair because of their efficiency and because they offer great fees,” he said. “I think bad airline 
service is like pain: you forget it as soon as it’s over and the next time people go to their computer if Ryanair is 30 
bucks cheaper then they’ll book with Ryanair.”
Sullenberger added: “Having been a pilot for over 50 years, which means I have been a part of aviation for 44 per 
cent of its entire history, I know how important it is that those running airlines understand and act on the great 
responsibilities they have to their passengers and their employees, even when they try to deny that they are

sound, in a hostile environment with outside air pressure one quarter that at the surface and outside temperatures 
to minus 70 degrees, and we must return it safely to the Earth every time.”
Ryanair has said there will be no lasting damage because of the rostering fiasco, and maintained its profit forecast 
of about €1.5 billion in the year to end of March 2018.

Highlight: O’Leary’s disdain for the pilot profession and his confidence in his own pilots have been sorely tested in 
recent days
Body
A few years ago, Michael O’Leary was holding forth to Ryan Tubridy on The Late Late Show. “Pilots are glorified 
taxi drivers,” he declared. “It is a very complicated taxi, and they are very skilled to be able to do it, but at the end of 
the day . . . it is a job.”
Aer Lingus pilots, O’Leary concluded, were “peacocks” because they were so fond of the status symbols of the job, 
such as peaked hats. Ryanair pilots were different, however, he said. “They are really good guys . . . We don’t 
tolerate an awful lot of the peacock nonsense that goes on.”
But O’Leary’s disdain for the pilot profession and his confidence in his own pilots have been sorely tested in recent 
days. After years of breakneck growth, Ryanair now finds itself running out of runway, as its pilots desert it for 
better-paid jobs.
Ryanair employs about 3,000 pilots either as full employees or as contractors, using various complicated 
mechanisms. One well-placed airline source estimated that, this year alone, more than 280 pilots had left the 
airline, or roughly 10 per cent of the total.
This would not be that high a churn if Ryanair was able to keep hiring more pilots. But it is a serious challenge 
when, suddenly, it is faced with rival airlines all gearing up at the same time.
To counter staff departures, Ryanair has stretched its existing pilot pool over the busy summer period. This led to 
large numbers not taking holiday leave, building up a problem for the airline which has now hit hard.
How Ryanair did not see this coming sooner raises questions for the airline, in particular whether it understands just 
how big a crisis it may be facing.
Lyons on the pilots
Ryanair has said that fewer than 100 pilots have gone to Norwegian Airlines. This is a smaller figure than has been 
rumoured, but it is still significant.
Other Ryanair pilots have gone to other European airlines, while some are being tempted by being offered work tax-
free in the Middle East.
A source at one Middle East airline indicated that there were in excess of 140 Ryanair pilots in a holding pool 
awaiting job openings.
Taking into account that this is just one of the four Middle Eastern carriers that have developed an appetite for 
Ryanair’s most experienced pilots, there could be more problems coming down the road.
The current crisis appears to have taken Ryanair by surprise, making it more than possible that it does not have a 
line of sight into just how many of its staff are in holding pools with other airlines.
Ryanair has offered existing staff incentives to stay on, and says it plans to hire or train up 600 more. This is all well 
and good, but it will take time. The airline does provide good opportunities for pilots to progress, but it is a difficult 
taskmaster. Many pilots are contractors working for separate companies.
This is good for Ryanair, as it reduces the airline’s financial responsibilities towards its pilots; it does nothing for 
engendering loyalty.
The elephant in the room for Ryanair is experience. The most experienced captains are the ones most attractive to 
other airlines.
The average co-pilot at most of the world’s airlines would have to gain eight years’ experience before being 
considered as a captain. At Ryanair, co-pilots are encouraged to become captains once they reach the minimum 
2,900 flying hours.
Ryanair is doing nothing outside the regulations, but airlines need a cohort of veteran pilots to guide and train less 
experienced pilots on the job. The more experienced pilots Ryanair loses, the harder it is to do this.
As Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the pilot in command during the accident which came to be known as the Miracle 
on the Hudson, warns today: flying a plane is not as straightforward as simply driving a more complicated taxi.
O’Leary has so far attempted to play hardball with his pilots. He has offered “some goodies” in the form of 
incentives for pilots to stay, but it is clear to many pilots that they can do better if they hold out.
Threatening industrial action is an obvious tactic to force O’Leary to pay them more. He is going to have to put his 
hand deeper into Ryanair’s cash-rich cookie jar to resolve things. If he doesn’t, his long and successful reign as 
chief executive could start to be seriously under question.

Ryanair found itself at the centre of a storm after abruptly cancelling more than 2,000 flights over six weeks to 
resolve a rota crisis that left it short of pilots.
The botched move has disrupted 315,000 passengers. But the Irish low-cost airline compounded the selfinflicted 
problem by not specifying for days which flights would be scrapped, throwing into doubt the plans of 18m people 
who have seats booked during the cancellation period.
The PR "boo boo" - as Michael O'Leary, chief executive, described it - has left the airline facing a (EURO)25m bill to 
compensate passengers, and the shares are down 11 per cent in the past month.
"We are not infallible, despite the fact that I like to think I am. My children frequently remind me that I'm anything but 
infallible," he told the company's annual meeting on Thursday.
Although Ryanair offered special bonuses to pilots if they would waive leave and stay a year at the airline, pilots in 
several of its bases rejected the proposal.
Ryanair then threatened to cancel pilot leave to settle the crisis, stirring further tension. Mr O'Leary acknowledged 
that the airline was increasing pilot pay in Dublin, London, Berlin and Frankfurt - a move that it is likely to prompt 
copycat pay claims at other bases.
Ryanair flies into storm as pilot shortage hits flights Airlines
The affair has its roots in Ryanair's move to counting crew flying hours over a calendar year instead of its April-
March fiscal year. That left many pilots with extra leave to take before January, which in turn created a shortage of 
standby pilots. See Lex

Stephen Smith had always avoided using Ryanair because of customer horror stories that have long dogged the 
Irish budget airline. Last year, however, the 33-year-old from Stockport was persuaded, after hearing good things 
from friends and family, to bite the bullet and use it.
His first experience was great. But after the low-cost airline's abrupt cancellation of more than 2,000 flights left Mr 
Smith and his wife stranded in Alicante last weekend - one of 315,000 passengers to have their flights taken from 
under them - he has vowed to never fly with them again.
"This is [only] the second time [we've] used them and it will be the last," says Mr Smith, who works for a UK energy 
company. "They just said we cancelled your flights ... that's it. Good luck. I can't fathom it. They shouldn't be able to 
get away with it."

The scrapping of 50 flights per day for a six-week period has dealt a severe blow to Ryanair, which has built its 
reputation over the past two decades as an efficient, safe and reliable operator, an airline that gets you to where 
you need to go on time.
The flight cancellations followed a regulatory change that forces airlines to count crew flying hours over a calendar 
year, instead of its fiscal year from April to March, which left the airline with too few standby pilots on its roster.
However it has left many analysts puzzled. "This was easily anticipated," says Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst 
at HSBC. "So there is a genuine issue around pilot staffing here."
Ryanair could face a longer-term problem with its 4,200 pilots after Michael O'Leary, the airline's combative chief 
executive, stirred up fresh anger by threatening to take back a week's holiday from them in October. The threat 
came as employee councils representing pilots in 14 bases rejected the offer of a bonus to cancel leave and stay 
an additional year at the airline.
The impact on its reputation was clear when the disaster forced a contrite Mr O'Leary to apologise and admit on 
Monday that it had "f***ed up".
Reinventing short haul Europe's largest budget carrier, Ryanair, alongside its low-cost rivals such as the UK's 
easyJet and Southwest in the US, has upended the airline industry over the past 30 years with an aggressive focus 
on cheap fares. In Europe, this has seen the budget airlines tear chunks out of the short-haul market, with flag 
carriers like British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM ceding as much as 40 per cent of the market to them.
"It was the given wisdom that short haul didn't usually make money. It was principally used by airlines to feed their 
long-haul flights. Ryanair turned that on its head," says John Strickland, a London-based aviation consultant.
Even as the airline industry gets ever more competitive, Ryanair remains at the top of the pack with increasing 
passenger numbers and profit. It has enjoyed uninterrupted growth since 1991, when it flew just 650,000 
passengers on six aircraft. This year it expects to fly more than 130m people using about 400 planes and in May 
forecast a post-tax profit of between (EURO)1.4bn and (EURO)1.45bn.
Its laser-sharp focus on cost has been the envy of rival airline bosses. "There isn't an airline in the world who 
doesn't want low cost. It is by being low cost that you can make better savings. Ryanair showed a lot of the older 
carriers how you might go about achieving that," says Andrew Charlton, an aviation analyst.
This has led to a fundamental change in the way airlines charge for flights, with full-service carriers aping many of 
the tactics successfully introduced by low-cost carriers. Gone are the days when the cost of a plane ticket included 
most things. You checked your bags, you were allocated a seat, and you were given food and drink.
These days, the majority of airlines charge for services, ranging from early boarding, advanced seat assignment to 
lounge access and extra weight allowance, as they move to unbundle fees from their base fares.
While the majority of the world's airlines are eyeing up further ways to lower their costs as well as generate further 
ancillary revenues, Ryanair's cancellation mess has shown that penny pinching can go too far and negatively 
impact on operations.
Ancillary revenues Over the past decade, revenues from ancillary fees have seen huge growth. The top 10 airlines, 
ranked by total ancillary revenue, generated $2.1bn in 2007. In 2016, this had jumped to more than $28bn, 
according to research by IdeaWorksCompany.
But while the measures have meant cheaper seat-only fares, rising fees and declining customer service have 
become a growing source of passenger complaints. This year premium carrier BA was accused of trying to 
"Ryanairise" when it started charging for food and drink on short-haul economy flights across Europe.

compensation after it cancelled 2,000 flights. But with t....
In the US, consumer anger over rising fees has been growing. In May, lawmakers vented frustrations over 
everything from airline baggage fees to a shortage of space in overhead luggage bins, and threatened legislation to 
protect air passenger rights, following the violent removal of a passenger from a United Continental flight the 
previous month.
The incident at United provoked public anger at many aspects of modern air travel, from involuntary removal from 
flights to accommodate staff to the proliferation of fees for changing flights, checking bags and even carry-on 
luggage. This week, the US Government Accountability Office highlighted how revenue from checked baggage and 
change and cancellation fees - the two charges US airlines have to report to the Department of Transportation - 
rose from $6.3bn in 2010 to $7.1bn last year.
The pressure on revenues has meant that even airlines that have long rejected the idea of charging for these 
services are realising the opportunity. Both Etihad Airways and Emirates Airlines, which have generally not charged 
for extras, have introduced ancillary fees over the past year as they look to boost their falling profits during a tough 
period for the Gulf airlines.
Unsurprisingly, the low-cost airlines have been the best at generating these ancillary revenues. US budget carrier 
Spirit leads the way, with ancillary fees making up as much as 46 per cent of its total revenue. In Europe, these 
charges represent 39.4 per cent of Wizz Air's revenues, followed by Ryanair at 26.8 per cent.
Pilot pressure After facing a grilling by Ryanair shareholders at its AGM on Thursday, Mr O'Leary suggested there 
might be a lesson to be learnt on pilot pay.
"Maybe we've gotten pilot pay a little bit on the low side," he admitted "If you look at our cost schedule, our crew 
costs at the moment are about (EURO)5 per passenger. EasyJet would be about (EURO)9 per passenger ... So 
maybe we have pushed it a little bit far in terms of pilot pay and pilot productivity."
Analysts say Ryanair's lean structure means it has little room for manoeuvre should it be hit with a problem, as in 
the case with its shortage of standby pilots. "Ryanair runs an extraordinarily tight ship. When something like this 
happens they haven't got much of a margin for error," says Mr Charlton.
The airline confirmed on Thursday that it would increase pilot pay - which for a captain is between £150,000 and 
£180,000 per year - but only in four centres Dublin, London Stansted, Berlin and Frankfurt. For a Dublin-based 
captain that would mean an increase in take-home pay of (EURO)22,000 including a one-off (EURO)12,000 bonus. 
The pay moves are partly a response to recent pilot defections to Norwegian Air. The airline also faces a bill of as 
much as (EURO)25m to compensate passengers for cancelled flights.
In spite of widespread passenger fury over Ryanair's flight cancellations, branding and aviation experts note that 
the reputation hit is likely to be shortlived in an industry that regularly gets criticised for bad customer service.
At the end of May, BA was hit by a power outage that sparked three days of travel chaos and left more than 75,000 
passengers stranded worldwide. In July, Willie Walsh, chief executive officer at IAG, said the disruption had so far 
cost it £73m. However, the incident had little impact on BA's first-half profit, which rose from (EURO)631m a year 
ago to (EURO)741m before exceptional items.
"Consumers have such low expectations for airline experiences that airline brands can survive mess-ups that would 
put other brands out of business ... and for many the only issue they care about with the exception of safety is low 
fares," says Allen Adamson, founder of Brand-Simple, a consultancy. "So an airline can cancel flights, lose bags, 
spill coffee on customers and so long as they have the cheapest fare between two destinations most passengers 
will buy the seat."
Mr O'Leary appears to have learnt that lesson, saying on Thursday that "usually the PR crises generate lots of 
publicity and sales". At the end of the airline's AGM, one shareholder said he had a friend who wanted a signed 
photograph of the Ryanair boss. Mr O'Leary responded by saying that he would charge (EURO)2.50 for a black-

Ryanair has been taking flak from consumer groups following its decision to cancel up to 50 flights a day for the 
next six weeks after a "mess up" with staffing rosters.
The budget airline this week released a list of disrupted flights, which will affect the travel plans of hundreds of 
thousands of passengers.
Those given less than 14 days' notice of cancelled flights can claim compensation, but Helen Dewdney, founder of 
the Complaining Cow website, said the airline was not doing enough to inform passengers about how to claim 
compensation.
"Ryanair should be trying to get you on to another flight, even if that is with another carrier and must pay you 
compensation," she said.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary on Thursday scrambled to placate pilots and reassure investors as the airline's 
annual general meeting was dominated by the cancellation of 2,000 flights in a "cock-up" that exposed major 
staffing issues.
The often outspoken CEO told investors that no more flights would be canceled because of rostering issues and 
that the company's profit margin would not be affected by the problems that sparked customer outrage and a wave 
of negative media coverage across Europe.
O'Leary told shareholders he took personal responsibility for the staffing issues and the way the company broke the 
news to customers, adding that Ryanair's pilot pay levels may have been too modest in the past.
However, he also used the meeting to outline a stick-and-carrot approach to dealing with pilots after some prepared 
a letter demanding new contracts.
"Will there be squabbles with pilots? There may be. They have been happening for about 30 years," he said.
Captains at four under-pressure bases have been offered an extra 10,000 euros a year in addition to an offer of a 
12,000 euro bonus for those who work an extra 10 days before the end of the year.
Citing pilot sources, Irish national broadcaster RTE said late on Thursday pilots from 55 bases had rejected the 
bonus pay offer, including at large Ryanair hubs in Dublin and London's Stansted airport.
At the shareholder meeting, O'Leary had denied reports that a significant number of pilots had rejected the offer.
Ryanair scrambles to please pilots, customers and investors
He also said he was considering forcing pilots to change their holiday plans and said any pilot who failed to show up 
for work as a form of industrial action would be frozen out of pay talks and denied promotion.
The Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, faced a wave of anger from customers after its 
announcement on Friday of plans to cancel between 40 and 50 flights a day until the end of October.
O'Leary said the decision was taken to cancel what amounted to 2% of the airline's total flights to avoid a sharp 
increase in delays because of a lack of reserve pilots. The rate of Ryanair's on-time flights has since increased from 
65% to 91%, he said.
"It was the right operational decision, but we handled it badly ... we upset and worried 80 million passengers," 
O'Leary added.
Passengers on canceled flights have complained that notice was far to short and that it was difficult to claim 
compensation. Others said they would not book a Ryanair flight while services were threatened with cancellation.
An unusually contrite O'Leary had held an emergency press conference on Monday to apologize and to publish a 
list of all affected flights.
The airline said the cancellations were because of a change in the way pilot's annual leave is calculated meant that 
too many were granted four-week breaks.
While the cancellations were required because it was too late to cancel those breaks in September and October, 
O'Leary said he may force pilots due leave in November and December to take three week blocks instead of four. 
Some of the leave may be postponed until next year, he said.
Some 1,750 of the airline's 4,200 pilots had blocks of four-week leave due before the end of the year, he said.
There were sufficient pilots to staff flights for the rest of the year but reserve crews are "tight," O'Leary said, 
meaning there may not be enough on standby to deal with unforeseen issues and avoid flight delays.
He said pilots had collectively offered to work an extra 2,500 days since the crisis broke -- the equivalent of 10 days 
from each of 250 of Ryanair's 4,200 pilots.
A source told Reuters that a letter had been approved by pilots at 17 of 85 Ryanair bases demanding new 
permanent, contracts under local labor law, though this could not be independently verified by Reuters.
"We haven't been sent anything yet," O'Leary said when asked about the letter. "We will not be responding to 
anonymous circular emails."
The crisis comes shortly after a ruling by the European Court of Justice said that Ryanair's employment contracts 
could, under certain circumstances, be challenged in courts outside of Ireland. Some analysts have suggested this 
could help staff to secure improved conditions.
"There will be more oversight of these contracts by local courts," O'Leary said of the ruling, "But there will be no 
changes to those contracts."
Ryanair has said it expects up to 20 million euros in compensation claims and 5 million euros in lost fares as a 
result of the cancellations, though analysts estimated the total cost could be higher.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.6% at 16.42 euros at 1334 GMT, having briefly dropped below 16 euros while 
O'Leary addressed the meeting. (Reuters)

Slipping staff a few quid to work longer hours is seldom a recipe for success. TV's best known Torquay hotelier, 
Basil Fawlty, found this to his cost. A failed attempt to bribe his chef to make a Waldorf Salad for a delayed 
American resulted in a black eye, a £20 loss and an exodus of guests.
But Ryanair's equally polite and customer-focused champion of lowcost tourism, Michael O'Leary, reckons the tactic 
could pay off. An offer of extra cash to his airline's pilots will result in no more delayed flights, limit losses to £22m, 
and help passengers on their way. Or so he claimed yesterday.
However, like Mr Fawlty with a handful of apples, celery, walnuts and grapes, he may have a bit too much 
confidence in his abilities (at one point, he also claimed to have "apologised personally" to the 315,000 people 
whose flights he cancelled this week - quite an undertaking in just five days).
After a pilot availability crisis emerged at the weekend - caused by a "boo-boo" in planning annual leave - Ryanair 
offered to pay a £12,000 bonus to any pilots willing to waive days off. And Mr O'Leary told shareholders yesterday 
that pilots had since agreed to work an extra 2,500 days. But, with reports suggesting the bonus was conditional on 
working 10 more days each, it would appear only 250 of the airline's 4,200 pilots signed up.
That makes it a relatively cheap solution: £3m to save 2,500 flying days, compared with £22m to cover 
compensation for the 2,100 flights cancelled already. Not a complete solution, though. Because Mr O'Leary also 
admitted Ryanair might have to force some pilots to defer their scheduled leave, to ensure there are no more 
Ryanair 's cash for pilots suggests its low-cost model may be faulty UK COMPANIES
cancellations. And this is an offer they cannot refuse. "We don't need their agreement," he noted, in a tone redolent 
of Fawlty Towers' finest revising the dinner menu.
That is just as well, as he would be unlikely to get it. Pilots at several Ryanair bases have already rejected the cash 
offer and demanded new contracts under local employment law. Some 140 have simply left to join Norwegian Air in 
recent months.
Such turnover is not new. Ryanair points out it has more than 600 pilots joining in the next six months. Still, it seems 
to bother Mr O'Leary. Why else would a low-cost airline raise its cash offer to pilots at certain bases by another 
(EURO)10,000? Ironically, it is to protect its low-cost model. Analysts note that if pilots currently classified as a 
freelancers under Irish law can claim to be regular employees in another country, the labour cost to Ryanair rises 
20 per cent. That route may now be open to pilots, following an EU court ruling last week - assuming they don't 
accept the airline's latest offer.
Add this risk of higher costs to downward pricing pressure and a 10 per cent valuation discount for Brexit, and 
Kepler estimates a Ryanair share price of (EURO)14.50 - 12 per cent lower than at present. It only makes Mr 
O'Leary look more like Mr Fawlty: flying by the seat of his pants to serve an unappetising concoction.

Ryanair pilots' holidays put in holding pattern after cancelled flights 'boo-boo'
Ryanair pilots' holidays put in holding pattern after cancelled flights 'boo-

Ryanair has threatened to disrupt the holiday plans of hundreds of its pilots as chief executive Michael O'Leary 
sought to resolve a crisis caused by the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights.
Mr O'Leary yesterday described the cancelled flights, which were caused by a shift from counting crew flying hours 
over a calendar year instead of its fiscal year, as a "boo-boo". He said the debacle had left Ryanair with only 20 or 
30 standby pilots on its roster instead of 150.
At the airline's annual meeting, Mr O'Leary said its full-year profit guidance would not be hit by the fallout from 
scrapping 50 flights per day for six weeks, despite facing a bill of as much as (EURO)25m to compensate 
passengers.
Ryanair confirmed that it would increase pilot pay at bases in Dublin, London, Berlin and Frankfurt amid defections 
to Norwegian Air. Dublinbased captains could expect an increase in their annual pay of (EURO)10,000, as well as a 
one-off (EURO)12,000 bonus.
But the airline risks stirring up further anger among pilots over its threat to take back a week's holiday in October - 
on top of outrage from customers and national regulators.
"We don't need their agreement," Mr O'Leary said. "It is part of our working agreements with the pilots and our 
rostering agreements that if we need to take back holidays with reasonable notice we can do so."
Ryanair pilots' holidays put in holding pattern after cancelled flights 'boo-boo'
Mr O'Leary dismissed reports that employee councils representing pilots in 14 bases had rejected the offer of a 
bonus to cancel leave and stay a year with the airline. Although Ryanair had agreed with pilots that they could take 
a four-week block of holiday as it moved to a new system under EU rules, Mr O'Leary said an over-allocation of 
leave had led to a shortage of standby pilots.
At the annual meeting, investors challenged Mr O'Leary, who was re-elected to the board with the support of 99.3 
per cent of shareholders.
Taking responsibility for the cancellations, he said: "We do have the sackcloth on. I have apologised personally to 
all of those passengers and to the ones we didn't disrupt. We are not going back to gung-ho management."
Mr O'Leary rejected claims that the airline had lost 700 pilots this year. He said 125 new pilots would start work with 
Ryanair this week, adding that a total of 500 new pilots would join by next March.

An investment in next-generation battery technology delivered Johnson Matthey its biggest gain in almost a decade 
yesterday.
The platinum chemicals specialist surged 14.6 per cent to £33.90 after setting out plans to invest £200m in bringing 
to market a cobalt-free battery material it claims will cut the cost and increase the range of electric vehicles.
Matthey said at a capital markets day that tests by carmakers of the cathode material have been successful and it 
aims to have batteries commercially available by 2021. "We think Matthey has delivered a confident riposte to fears 
over its terminal growth given the diesel debate at the heart of the investment case," said Morgan Stanley.
"Cobalt is a small market and susceptible to large price swings, hence any thrifting is a positive development for 
automotive original equipment manufacturers. Success will clearly depend on the level of OEM adoption but it is an 
interesting development, and reminds us that the EV economy needs to be supported by technology 
improvements."
A mixed wider market left the FTSE 100 little changed with the index drifting 0.1 per cent lower, or 8.05 points, to 
7,263.90.
B&Q owner Kingfisher reversed most of Wednesday's post-results rally, losing 4.1 per cent to 300.2p. JPMorgan 
was among the brokers to remain cautious, saying Kingfisher will probably need to reinvest cost savings in 
response to growing competition.
London Johnson Matthey sparked by investment in battery technology
CRH rose 2.4 per cent to £27.19 after it agreed to buy Ash Grove, the US's fifthlargest cement producer, for a 
$3.5bn enterprise value. Barclays estimated a boost to earnings per share of between 5 and 7 per cent before 
synergies.
"Although no official synergy target has been disclosed yet, CRH is Ash Grove's largest customer and has been 
working in partnership with the company for decades. The integration of the assets may therefore prove beneficial," 
it said.
Schroders was 1.4 per cent weaker at £32.66 after JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded to "neutral".
Ryanair crept 0.4 per cent higher at (EURO)16.57 as its botched pilot rota dominated the annual meeting. Kepler 
said its reputation problem could explain why it has cut prices by 8 per cent for the winter schedule, on the back of 
15 to 17 per cent cuts for winter 2016.
Downgrading the stock to "reduce", Kepler also worried that Ryanair's model will be undermined by a recent ruling 
from the European Court of Justice that employees classed as freelancers under Irish law can raise legal actions in 
their home base.
Outsourcer Capita plunged 11.6 per cent to 569.5p after reporting a reduced bid pipeline and a weakening of its 
trading businesses.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary yesterday apologised to the airline's board and shareholders for the "major 
management failure" that has led to hundreds of flight cancellations, and said the group is undertaking a major 
recruitment drive aimed at fixing the problem.
His comments came as reports suggested Ryanair will sue pilots union IALPA and the Guardian for defamation.
O'Leary said sorry at the company's annual general meeting, where he is facing serious questions over a 
scheduling meltdown that has caused the group to cancel up to 50 flights a day over a six-week period.
It has run into problems after operating a record schedule and traffic levels during July and August.
Responding to reports from a local journalist that Ryanair was taking legal action against the IALPA and the 
Guardian, a spokesperson for the budget airline said the company will "issue legal proceedings against any media 
or unions which publish false claims about our safety".
However, the Guardian said it was not subject to any legal proceedings by Ryanair, although it has been contacted 
by the airline.

Ryanair CEO admits mistakes amid cancellations crisis

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary admitted mistakes to disgruntled shareholders Thursday as the 
airline struggles to overcome a scheduling crisis that is costing the company millions of euros.
Speaking at Ryanair's annual general meeting, O'Leary said he planned to force pilots to give up a week of vacation 
time this year to prevent further flight cancellations. Pilots will be told that the airline will "make it up to you."
"We make mistakes," he said. "This time we made a major boo boo."
Ryanair, a no-frills airline based in Dublin that is Europe's biggest carrier by number of passengers, is cancelling 
2,100 flights over the next six weeks because it "messed up" the allocation of annual leave as it shifts to a new 
holiday scheduling system. Compensation for passengers forced to re-book could reach 25 million euros ($30 
million). Passengers, meanwhile, are reporting problems in gaining compensation, inundating the firm's Facebook 
page with complaints.
O'Leary's statement comes amid reports that flight captains and first officers have rejected Ryanair's offer of bonus 
payments in exchange for taking on more hours. The Guardian newspaper also reported that Ryanair pilots are 
trying organize a protest under which they would refuse to do any work beyond what is required by their contracts, 
which would cause more scheduling headaches for the airline.
O'Leary later insisted there were no problems between the company and the pilots and that if they misbehave "that 
will be the end of the goodies."
"I don't even know how there would be industrial action in Ryanair," he said. "There isn't a union."
The Irish Air Line Pilots' Association says the real problem is that Ryanair failed to plan for the implementation of 
new European safety regulations that take effect Jan. 1 and require all airlines to use a regular calendar year for 
calculating pilot flight hours and working days. Until now, Ryanair has used a 12-month period beginning April 1, 
which gave it a competitive advantage in scheduling pilots during the busy summer season because hours 
accumulated from January to March didn't carry over into the new scheduling year, the IALPA said in a statement.
Ryanair CEO admits mistakes amid cancellations crisis
"Since there is no requirement in aviation regulation to provide annual leave per se, it is unclear what is compelling 
Ryanair to provide any leave to their pilots at this time," the association said. "It seems clear that Ryanair has failed 
to plan properly for the implementation of the regulations."
The association also says Ryanair is struggling to cope with a high turnover rate among pilots as the airline 
expands its fleet.
Loizos Heracleous, a professor of strategy and organization at Warwick Business School, said it is surprising that a 
company so focused on optimizing operations "could be caught out like this," and that it is mushrooming into a 
much bigger problem.
"The bigger issue is that this debacle is opening the floodgates for pilots to demand better pay and working 
conditions," Heracleous said. "Ryanair is recruiting new pilots and will probably have to sweeten the deal to reduce 
pilot turnover, in particular countries where the package is less competitive."
Former Ryanair pilot James Atkinson, writing in the Guardian, said the airline uses divide and control tactics to keep 
pilots on different kinds of contracts and to prevent them from organizing.
"There's an underlying problem at Ryanair, which is quite simply that the company cannot replace pilots as fast as 
they quit," he wrote. "The head of the company, Michael O'Leary, openly insults his pilots, and has consistently 
maintained a policy of heading off any attempt to achieve a collectively bargained contract."

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares were little changed on Thursday as a stronger dollar 
pulled down mining stocks, offsetting gains in the banking sector.  The benchmark FTSE 100 was virtually 
unchanged at 7,272 in late opening deals after closing 0.1 percent lower on Wednesday.  Lender Barclays rallied 
2.7 percent and Lloyds Banking Group rose about 1 percent amid surging bond yields after the U.S. Federal 
Reserve struck a hawkish tone by signaling another rate hike this year and said it would begin shrinking its $4.5 
trillion balance sheet starting October. 
 Johnson Matthey shares soared 4.6 percent after the chemicals company confirmed its guidance for the current 
financial year ending March 31, 2018.  Irish building materials firm CRH rose nearly 3 percent after the company 
said it would buy U.S. cement maker Ash Grove Cement Co in a $3.5 billion deal to expand business in North 
America.  Anglo American climbed 2.7 percent after Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal revealed plans to increase his 
stake in the company to just over 20 percent.   Antofagasta fell 2.2 percent, BHP Billiton lost 1 percent and 
Glencore shed 0.8 percent as a stronger dollar hit commodity prices.   Ryanair Holdings shares dropped 1.3 
percent. The airline's pilots have rejected an offer of a \xA312,000 payment to work additional days and help 
alleviate a pilot shortage following the cancellation of 2,100 flights.  Troubled outsourcer Capita plunged 9.5 percent 
after reporting a fall in first-half underlying revenue.   In economic releases, official data showed that public sector 
net borrowing excluding interventions decreased by GBP 1.3 billion to GBP 5.7 billion in August. This was the

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) pilots have rejected a cash bonus offered to them 
by the airline in exchange for cancelling their leave as the airline grapples with massive flight cancellations.  Ryanair 
is cancelling 40 to 50 flights daily for the next six weeks, till the end of October, after it admitted to having 'messed 
up' the planning of pilot holidays. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said that some pilots were being offered a pay rise 
of 10,000 euros in exchange for helping out. 
  According to media reports, Ryanair had already offered captains a one-off payment of 12,000 pounds or 12,000 
euros, and first officers 6,000 pounds or 6,000 euros. However, pilot representatives have rejected the cash bonus 
and said they want new contracts and better working conditions instead.  The BBC reported that in a letter seen by 
it, pilot representatives from 30 of the company's 80 or so European bases have turned down the cash bonus offer.  
'The pilot market is changing, and Ryanair will need to change the ways which the pilots and management work 
together to ensure a stable and common future for everyone,' the pilot representatives said in the letter.  At the 
airline's annual general meeting or AGM on Thursday, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary apologized to the airline's 
shareholders and customers for the cancellation of 2,100 of its over 103,000 flights over a 6 week period in 
September and October, due to a failure within its pilot rostering function.  Ryanair said that by the end of this week, 
it expects to have re-accommodated, or authorised refund requests, to over 95 percent of the 315,000 customers 
affected by these cancellations.  Further, O'Leary told the AGM that Ryanair was facing a 'significant management 
failure' and the cancellations have cost the airline about 25 million euros.

Michael O'Leary is seldom lost for words or slow to point the finger.
Regulators, airports, air traffic controllers, even passengers have found themselves subjects of bad-tempered 
tirades by Ryanair's chief executive.
But on Monday, after the budget carrier abruptly said it was cancelling up to 2,100 flights in the next six weeks 
because of problems with pilot rotas, the public saw a rare sight: a contrite Mr O'Leary holding his hands up and 
admitting that Ryanair had "f***ed up".
The admission will be galling to Ryanair's longstanding boss going into the company's annual meeting in Dublin 
today.
His company has established a reputation over the past 20 odd years as operationally efficient, with a good safety 
record and a laser-sharp focus on costs.
But in the past month, it has had a string of problems: the cancellations, a European court ruling against it, and 
signs of a shareholder revolt on pay.
Improving staff relations is urgent task for Ryanair Airlines. Rota problems ; Rare O'Leary apology amid 
cancellation woes, court blow and signs of investor rev....
The share price has responded with an 8 per cent drop over the past week. On the year, though, it is still 32 per 
cent higher, compared with 18 per cent at its rival easyJet.
John Strickland, a London-based aviation consultant, said: "Michael has long argued that Ryanair does the 
fundamentals. It will take you on time, safely and with your bag. Until now, that has largely been the case. Being so 
operationally focused, they should have seen this coming."
How Ryanair got its rotas so wrong is likely to be a key question from shareholders today. Another will be why 
Ryanair did not immediately publish a full list of cancellations, choosing to worry all 18m of its passengers over the 
next six weeks - rather than the 2 per cent affected.
The cancellation mess, which will affect 315,000 passengers, came at the end of a bad week: a day before, Ryanair 
suffered a legal blow that raises questions about its employment model and could lead to higher labour costs.
It had embarked on a legal battle to force staff across Europe to take disputes to the Irish courts, but then the 
European Court of Justice ruled that cabin crew based in other countries could pursue legal claims locally.
While Ryanair has insisted that there will be no change to its practice of employing staff across Europe on Irish 
contracts, which has productivity and wage benefits for the company, aviation analysts are not convinced.
"The Mons judgment comes at quite an interesting time, and could put pressure on their business model," said 
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC.
"We estimate that it could lead to a 20 per cent increase in Ryanair's labour costs and could [have] a reasonable 
impact."
Mr Lobbenberg noted that the extra cost was of relevance, despite the fact that based on HSBC's estimates, it 
would cut net profit by only 12 per cent, and its financial margin from 24 to 20 per cent.
"The real defining differentiator between Ryanair and other airlines in Europe is clearly how they run their company, 
how they manage relations with labour.
"The Mons judgment has the potential to lead to the removal of their relative advantage. It will still be a powerful 
company, but its relative cost advantage over everyone else narrows meaningfully."
The ECJ ruling, plus its pilot rostering issue, appear to point to a longer-term problem with labour costs.
As a short-term fix, Ryanair is offering pilots a £12,000 bonus for those who waive days off and stay with the airline 
for a year.
Mr O'Leary told analysts on Monday that Ryanair would spend (EURO)20m-(EURO)30m over the next year to hire 
extra pilots.
He said it would have to increase pay in some countries - including Germany, the UK and Ireland - where 
competitors are poaching its pilots. Ryanair has lost 140 pilots to low-cost rival Norwegian Air since the beginning of 
the year. He admitted that Ryanair had a shortage of experienced first officers ready for promotion to captain.
Some staffing problems might be harder to fix.
One Ryanair pilot said pilots had had enough.
"There's a massive resentment across pilots. Pay [rises] may not even be enough."
He said more than 100 pilots were meeting today at Stansted to discuss working conditions. It follows a meeting of 
pilots in Dublin this week.
Improving staff relations is urgent task for Ryanair Airlines. Rota problems ; Rare O'Leary apology amid 
cancellation woes, court blow and signs of investor rev....
While Mr O'Leary is adamant that Ryanair does not have a pilot shortage, pointing to a growth in numbers to 4,200 
and a waiting list of 2,500, it is clear they are not staying with the airline for as long as they used to. Ryanair's 
annual 20-F filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission show that the average length of a pilot's 
employment was four years as of March 2017. This was down from an average of 5.2 years in 2014.
In the same period, the number of pilots employed by the airline rose to 4,058, from 2,665 in 2014.
While there could be crunch points ahead, analysts acknowledge that Ryanair is likely to retain its strong position in 
the industry.
"It's not going to change the fact that they will continue to offer some of the cheapest flights to passengers," said 
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum. "It doesn't stop the long-term fundamentals of the business."

Recent news of Ryanair's plans to scrap hundreds of flights between now and the end of October due to poor 
planning is set to cause chaos for over 385,000 passengers, with shares in the brand dipping by nearly 5 percent as 
a result.
This is jarring, not just for those affected, but also since Ryanair, Europe's biggest discount airline, has publicly 
invested heavily in boosting their image. This new image aims to support a friendlier and more customer focused 
portrayal, improving customer experience and loyalty, alongside enabling attraction and retention of a more 
lucrative customer base.
While immediate efforts were made to provide refunds or alternative flights, redeeming the brand equity lost will not 
be easy. Customers don't simply forget, especially if they have missed a friend's wedding or an important family trip.
Businesses can and should employ tactics to monitor and protect their brand, not just a logo, but what they stand 
for and how they communicate. One good measure of brand value is the Net Promoter Score; a loyalty metric that 
measures the likelihood of future engagement. This is something we at LDF pay close attention to.
Irrespective of whether you are a brand giant or a relative unknown, brands are built on reputation. Customers are 
your currency and you can't ignore the fact that a brand takes time to build, and one bad move to damage.
ABOUT THE BUSINESS Cheshire-based business, Extreme Adventure specialises in adrenaline: extreme assault 
courses, laser mazes, slackline tightrope walking, zorbing and sniper training.
The family-owned business, has been trading for over ten years and is always trying new ideas, like Segway 
obstacle courses and racing, or the first ever mobile high-level rope climbing and activity course.
A BRAND TAKES TIME TO BUILD, AND ONE BAD MOVE TO DAMAGE VIEWS FROM THE FLIPSIDE
WHY FINANCE? Diana Caldwell, Director, needed funding to allow the company to keep coming up with new, more 
extreme adventures. This meant investing in new equipment and a lot of new overheads.
LDF have worked closely with Extreme Adventure for several years, arranging several agreements, including a 
business development loan for a brand-new ninja assault course and asset finance for Segway's, mobile high ropes 
and vehicle simulators.
HOW DID THIS HELP THE BUSINESS TO GROW? Extreme Adventure have been able to carry on with what they 
do best - - bringing adventure direct to their audience. This has significantly pushed up their profits and turnover. 
New events include the UK's first mobile ninja assault course, a chance for people to test themselves against the 
course, against each other, and against the clock.
The level that the business has been able to invest and grow through finance is a success story and demonstrates 
that this something that can be embraced by even the most diverse of industries.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary told the annual shareholders meeting on Thursday that the 
airline expects to have re-accommodated, or authorized refund requests to, over 95% of the 315,000 customers 
that are affected by planned flight cancellations by the end of the week.
The airline last week said it would cancel between 40 and 50 flights daily for the next six weeks to improve its 
system-wide punctuality due to a failure within its pilot rostering function.
Separately, Reuters cited O'Leary as saying that the company is considering forcing 500 pilots to change their 
holiday plans to avoid risking additional flight delays. The company has offered pilots a bonus to work an additional 
ten days to counter the pilot shortage.
