 increase in the number of hours flown.
Maintenance costs increased by 14% to EUR16.3m primarily due to a combination of
 an 11% increase in the number of leased aircraft from 35 to 39 and the increased
 level of activity, offset by the positive impact of a stronger euro versus US
 dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 30% to EUR4.3m due to tight control
 on expenditure and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 3% to EUR19.1m as the number of leased aircraft
 increased by 11% to 39 compared to the quarter ended September 30,
 2007 reflecting the positive impact of lower lease rental rates due to lower
 financing costs and the impact of a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange
 rate.
Route charges rose by 17% to EUR76.9m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown and a 1% increase in the average sector length.
Airport and handling charges increased by 16% to EUR124.4m due to the 20% increase
 in passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched
 and savings achieved on handling costs.
Other expenses decreased by 2% to EUR30.7m, which is lower than the growth in
 ancillary revenues, due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -8-
 reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 15 points to 20% due to the reasons outlined
 above and operating profits have decreased by 31% to EUR210.7m compared to the
 quarter ended September 30, 2007.
Interest receivable has increased by 10% to EUR23.6m for the quarter primarily due
 to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period.
Interest payable increased by 30% to EUR28.5m due to the drawdown of debt to part
 finance the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher interest
 rates.
Foreign exchange losses during the quarter of EUR2.4m are primarily due to the
 impact of changes in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro.
Exceptional items:
Accelerated depreciation of EUR7.8m arose on aircraft to be disposed in the
 financial years 2008/9 and 2009/10, to write these aircraft down to their
 recoverable amounts when disposal occurs, thus leading to a zero gain or loss on
 disposal.

Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 half year period and quarter ended September 30, 2008
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim income statements for the half-year
 period and quarter ended September 30, 2008, as set forth on pages 6 and 7 of
 this half-yearly financial report, presents the results for the periods
 separately between pre-exceptional and exceptional items. Certain items are
 presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue of their size or
 incidence, are unusual in the context of the Groups's ongoing core operations,
 as we believe this presentation represents the underlying business more
 accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the
 results.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact
 Ryanair's expected results for the second half of the year are the airline
 pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers,
 market prices for the replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental,
 safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, UK, European Union ("EU")
 and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in
 currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour

 relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general
 economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general
 willingness of passengers to travel and other economic, social and political
 factors.
Board of directors
Details of the members of our Board of Directors are set forth on pages 29 and
 30 of our 2008 Annual Report.
Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior
 key management personnel. All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on
 consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions that have taken place in the six month
 period ended September 30, 2008 that materially affected the financial position
 or the performance of the Group during that period and there were no changes in
 the related party transactions described in the 2008 Annual Report that could
 have a material effect on the financial position or performance of the Group in
 the same period.
 Post balance sheet events
In October 2008, pursuant to the share buy-back programme announced in February
 2008, the Company repurchased and cancelled 6.25m shares at a total cost of
 EUR13m. This is equivalent to 0.4% of the issued share capital of the Company at
 September 30, 2008.
In October 2008, the Group exercised ten options under the 2005 contract with
 Boeing increasing its "firm" aircraft deliveries by this amount during the 2011
 fiscal year. To date, this brings Ryanair's total firm orders for Boeing 737-800
 aircraft to 147 and the total fleet size (net of planned disposals) to 279 by
 2013.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
 exceptional items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the
 period under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 15.
Exceptional items in the half year ended September 30, 2008 amounted to EUR119.2m
 consisting of a EUR93.6m impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding and an
 accelerated depreciation charge of EUR25.7m on aircraft to be disposed in the
 financial years 2008/9 and 2009/10.
Adjusted profit excluding exceptional items decreased by 47% to EUR214.6m.
 Including exceptional items the profit for the half year amounted to
 EUR95.3m compared to a profit of EUR407.6m in the half year ended September 30,
 2007.
 Summary half year ended September 30, 2008
Profit after tax decreased by 47% to EUR214.6m compared to EUR407.6 in the half year
 ended September 30, 2007 primarily due to a 101% increase in fuel costs.  Total
 operating revenues increased by 16% to EUR1,810.6m, slower than the 19% growth in
 passenger volumes, as average fares declined by 4%, due to the absence of Easter
 in the half year and lower baggage penetration rates. Ancillary revenues grew by
 28% to EUR322.1m during the period.  Total revenue per passenger as a result
 decreased by 2%, whilst the Load Factor was down 1% during the period to 85%.
Total operating expenses increased by 44% to EUR1,574.2m, primarily due to the
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and increased costs,
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 50% of total
 operating costs compared to 36% in the half year ended September 30, 2007,
 increased by 101% to EUR788.5m due to the increase in the price per gallon and an

11.  Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
 All revenues derive from the Group's principal activity and business segment as
 a low fares airline and includes scheduled services, car hire, internet income
 and related sales to third parties.
Revenue is analysed by geographical area (by country of origin) as follows:

All of the Group's operating profit arises from low fares airline-related
 activities, its only business segment. The major revenue earning assets of the
 Group are comprised of its aircraft fleet, which is registered in Ireland and
 therefore principally all profits accrue in Ireland. Since the Group's aircraft
 fleet is flexibly employed across its route network in Europe, there is no
 suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical
 segments.

 of EUR260.5 million (half year ended September 30, 2007: EUR329.9 million).There
 were four Boeing 737-800 aircraft disposed of during the half year, the balance
 of the sales proceeds of which amounted to EUR78.8m.  Deposits have also been
 received in relation to future aircraft disposals.
14.  Post balance sheet events
 In October 2008, pursuant to the share buy-back programme announced in February
 2008, the Company repurchased and cancelled 6.25m shares at a total cost of
 EUR13m. This is equivalent to 0.4% of the issued share capital of the Company at
 September 30, 2008.
In October 2008, the Group exercised ten options under the 2005 contract with
 Boeing increasing its "firm" aircraft deliveries by this amount during the 2011
 fiscal year. To date, this brings Ryanair's total firm orders for Boeing 737-800
 aircraft to 147 and the total fleet size (net of planned disposals) to 279 by
 2013.
15.  US GAAP Reconciliation
 Following on from the issuance by the SEC of Rule 3235 "Acceptance from Foreign
 Private Issuers of Financial Statements prepared in accordance with
 International Financial Reporting Standards without reconciliation to US GAAP",
 the Group has chosen to exclude a US GAAP Reconciliation from these interim
 financial statements.

Independent review report of KPMG to Ryanair Holdings plc
Introduction
We have been engaged by Ryanair Holdings plc ("the Company") to review the
 condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended
 September 30, 2008, which comprise the condensed consolidated interim income
 statement, the condensed consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed
 consolidated interim statement of cash flows, the condensed consolidated interim
 statement of recognised income and expense and the related notes thereto. We
 have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report
 and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material
 inconsistencies with the information in the condensed consolidated interim
 financial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our
 engagement to assist the Company in meeting the requirements of the Transparency
 (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the
 Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency
 Rules of the UK's Financial Services Authority ("the FSA"). Our review has been
 undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required
 to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
 permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
 the Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have
 reached.
Directors' responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report, including the condensed consolidated interim
 financial statements contained therein, is the responsibility of, and has been
 approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the
 interim report in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC)
 Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Republic of Ireland's
 Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK FSA.
As disclosed in note 1 - basis of preparation, the annual consolidated financial
 statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') as issued by the International
 Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the European Union ('EU'). The
 condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this half-yearly
 financial report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, "Interim
 Financial Reporting," as adopted by the EU.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed
 consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report,
 based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review
 Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information
 Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the Auditing
 Practices Board for use in Ireland and the UK. A review of interim financial
 information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
 financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
 procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
 accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and
 consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware
 of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we
 do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
 that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly
 financial report for the six months ended September 30, 2008 are not prepared,
 in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU, the
 Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules
 of the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and
 Transparency Rules of the UK FSA.

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is
 subject to important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
 differ materially. It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the many
 factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an
 airline operating in the European economy. Among the factors that are subject to
 change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are the airline
 pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers,
 market prices for the replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental,
 safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union ("EU")
 and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in
 currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour
 relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general
 economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general
 willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political

Body
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
 interim financial statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our
 2008 Annual Report, have been prepared in accordance with International
 Accounting Standard No. 34 ("IAS 34") "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted
 by the EU. They do not include all of the information required for full annual
 financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent
 published consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2008 do not
 constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
 Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group Accounts)
 Regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31,
 2008 are being filed with the Companies' Office. The auditors' report on those
 financial statements was unqualified.
In addition to the presentation of the condensed consolidated interim financial
 statements for the half-year period ended September 30, 2008, the condensed
 consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of recognised
 income and expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 have also been
 provided on a supplementary basis and have been prepared in accordance with the
 measurement and recognition principles of IFRS as adopted by the EU.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the interim financial statements for the six months ended September 30,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -9-
 2008 on October 31, 2008.
Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been
 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
 recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
 accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS's as
 issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results. In the
 current period we have presented an impairment of a financial asset investment
 and also accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals separately
 because of the unusual nature of these items.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional"
 for management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts of
 the same nature.
Reclassifications
 The Company has reclassified the following amounts in its comparative balance
 sheet as at March 31, 2008:
 *  a reclassification of EUR2.0m from other creditors to provisions, both within
 non-current liabilities, reflecting the present value of the Company's net
 pension obligations; and
 *  a reclassification of EUR23.1m from the capital redemption reserve fund to share
 premium related to the share buy-back.
Amounts have been reclassified so as to present these balances on a consistent
 basis with the current period presentation.
2.   Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
Except as described below, in preparing these consolidated financial statements,
 the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting
 policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those
 that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.    Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
 half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
4.   Income tax expense
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -9-
The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the six
 months ended September 30, 2008 was 9%.  As the Group is forecasting a breakeven
 outturn it is anticipated that a credit will be recorded in later quarters to
 offset this charge.
5.   Capital and reserves
 Share buy back programme.
 Pursuant to the share buy-back programme announced in February 2008, from April
 1, 2008 to date, the Company has repurchased and cancelled 18.1m shares at a
 total cost of EUR46m. This is equivalent to 1.2% of the issued share capital of
 the Company at September 30, 2008. (6.25m of these shares, with a value of EUR13m,
 were repurchased post the balance sheet date, in October 2008).
6.   Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the period of approximately EUR1.5m is related to the fair value
 of various share options granted in prior periods, which are being recognised
 within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
7.   Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
8.   Capital commitments
 During the half year ended September 30, 2008, the Group exercised seven options
 under the 2005 contract with Boeing whereby it will increase its "firm" aircraft
 deliveries by this amount during the 2011 fiscal year.At September 30, 2008,
 this brings Ryanair's total firm orders for Boeing 737-800 aircraft to 137 and
 the total fleet size (net of planned disposals) to 279 by 2013.
9.   Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 In the half year ended September 30, 2008, the Group recognised an impairment
 charge of EUR93.6 million on its shareholding in Aer Lingus reflecting a further
 decline in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR2.00 per share at March 31, 2008 to
 EUR1.40 at June 30, 2008. In the quarter to September 30, 2008 the Group
 recognised a gain through reserves of EUR3.6m reflecting an increase in Aer Lingus
 the share price to EUR1.42 at September 30, 2008.  The Aer Lingus shares are
 currently trading at approx EUR1.06. Should its share price remain at this level
 the Group would be required to take a further impairment charge of EUR57.3m at the
 end of the next quarter.

 increase in the number of hours flown, offset by a positive movement in the US
 dollar exchange rate versus the euro.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 6%
 and including fuel they rose by 21%.  Operating margins fell by 17 points to 13%
 whilst operating profit decreased by 49% to EUR236.4m.
Net margins decreased to 12% from 26% at September 30, 2007 for the reasons
 outlined above.
Earnings per share for the period was 14.44 cent compared to 26.61 cent in the
 previous half year ended September 30, 2007.
Balance sheet
 Gross cash remained strong at EUR2063.1m.  The Group generated cash from operating
 activities of EUR177.7m and a further EUR78.8m delivery proceeds on the sale of four
 Boeing 737-800 aircraft which part funded a EUR33.1m share buy back programme and
 capital expenditure incurred during the period.  Capital expenditure of EUR260.5m
 largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future aircraft deliveries
 and the delivery of five new aircraft in the half year.  Long term debt, net of
 repayments, decreased by EUR65.4m during the period.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Half Year ended September 30, 2008
Adjusted profit after tax, decreased by 47% to EUR214.6m primarily due to a
 doubling of fuel costs.  Total operating revenues grew by 16% due to a 19%
 increase in passenger numbers and the strong growth in ancillary revenues
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -7-
 compared to the period ended September 30, 2007 partially offset by a decrease
 in fares due to the absence of Easter and lower baggage penetration rates.  The
 growth in revenues was offset primarily by increases in fuel prices which rose
 by 101% to EUR788.5m, route charges, and airport costs.  Operating margins, as a
 result, fell by 17 points to 13%, whilst operating profit decreased by 49% to
 EUR236.4m.
Total operating revenues increased by 16% to EUR1,810.6m whilst passenger volumes
 increased by 19% to 31.6m.  Total revenue per passenger decreased by 2% due to
 the 4% fall in average fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 14% to EUR1,488.4m reflecting a 19%
 increase in traffic due to increased passenger numbers on existing routes and
 the successful launch of new routes and bases, offset by a 4% decrease in
 average fares due to the absence of Easter and lower baggage penetration
 rates.Load factor decreased by 1%, to 85%, compared to the half year ended
 September 30, 2007.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
 by 28% to EUR322.1m in the period. This performance reflects the growth in onboard
 sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 44% to EUR1,574.2m primarily due to the 101%
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and the increased costs
 associated with the growth of the airline. Total operating expenses were also
 adversely impacted by a 2% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs increased by 9% to EUR160.0m.  Excluding the charge of EUR7.0m for a one
 off staff share option grant in the period ended September 30, 2007 staff costs
 increased by 15%.  This primarily reflects a 31% increase in average employee
 numbers to 6,371. Cabin crew, who earn lower than the average salary, accounted
 for the vast majority of the increase.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 27% to EUR96.8m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 24 aircraft or a 23% increase in the lower cost 'owned'
 aircraft in the fleet this period compared to the half year ended September 30,
 2007, offset by, the positive impact on aircraft costs and amortisation
 resulting from the weaker US dollar rate versus euro.
Fuel costs rose by 101% to EUR788.5m due to the increase in fuel costs and a 22%
 increase in the number of hours flown.
Maintenance costs increased by 14% to EUR30.6m as the number of leased aircraft
 increased from 4 to 39 and the increased level of activity, offset by the
 positive impact of a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 50% to EUR7.3m due to tight control
 on expenditure and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -7-
Aircraft rental costs increased by 4% to EUR38.2m as the number of leased aircraft
 increased by 4 to 39 compared to the half year ended September 30, 2007
 reflecting the positive impact of lower lease rental rates due to lower
 financing costs and the impact of a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange
 rate.
Route charges rose by 17% to EUR151.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown and a 2% increase in the average sector length.
Airport and handling charges increased by 14% to EUR238.3m due to the 19% increase
 in passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched
 and savings achieved on handling costs.
Other expenses increased by 3% to EUR63.4m, which is lower than the growth in
 ancillary revenues, due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
 reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 17 points to 13% due to the reasons outlined
 above and operating profits have decreased by 49% to EUR236.4m compared to
 the half year ended September 30, 2007.
Interest receivable has increased by 12% to EUR46.4m for the period primarily due
 to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period.
Interest payable increased by 31% to EUR58.6m due to the drawdown of debt to part
 finance the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher interest
 rates.
Foreign exchange gains during the period of EUR0.1m are primarily due to the
 positive impact of changes in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro.
Exceptional items:
Accelerated depreciation of EUR25.7m arose on aircraft to be disposed in the
 financial years 2008/9 and 2009/10, to write these aircraft down to their
 recoverable amounts when disposal occurs, thus leading to a zero gain or loss on
 disposal.
Impairment charge:  During the half year the Group recognised an impairment
 charge of EUR93.6m on its Aer Lingus shareholding reflecting the decline in the
 Aer Lingus share price from EUR2.00 per share at March 31, 2008 to EUR1.40 per share
 at June 30, 2008.  The share price was EUR1.42 at September 30, 2008.  Under IFRS
 accounting rules, this positive mark to market movement, in the quarter to
 September 30, 2008, can only be recorded in the balance sheet through reserves.
 These shares are currently trading at approx. EUR1.06. Should its share price
 remain at this level the Group would be required to take a further impairment
 charge of EUR57.3m at the end of the next quarter.
Balance sheet

 Gross cash remained strong at EUR2063.1m.  The Group generated cash from operating
 activities of EUR177.7m and a further EUR78.8m delivery proceeds on the sale of

 amounted to EUR260.5m which largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for
 future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of five new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
 Long term debt, net of repayments, decreased by EUR65.4m during the period.
Shareholders' Equity at September 30, 2008 increased by EUR199.9m to EUR2,702.1m,
 compared to March 31, 2008 due to the post exceptional EUR95.3m increase in
 profitability during the period, the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for
 derivative financial assets, pensions and stock option grants, offset by
 the EUR33.1m share buy back. (See details in note 10).
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended September 30, 2008
Adjusted profit after tax, decreased by 28% to EUR193.6m primarily due to a 109%
 increase in fuel costs. Total operating revenues grew by 20% in line with
 the increase in passenger numbers compared to the quarter ended September 30,
 2007, a 1% decrease in fares, lower baggage penetration rates and strong growth
 in ancillary revenues.  The growth in revenues was offset primarily by the
 increase in fuel prices which rose by 109% to EUR422.0m, increases in route
 charges and airport costs.  Operating margins, as a result, fell by 15 points to
 20%, whilst operating profit decreased by 31% to EUR210.7m.
Total operating revenues increased by 20% to EUR1,033.7m whilst passenger volumes
 increased by 20% to 16.7m.  Total revenue per passenger remained flat as average
 fares fell by 1%.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 18% to EUR858.3m reflecting a 20%
 increase in traffic due to increased passenger numbers on existing routes and
 the successful launch of new routes and bases, offset by a 1% decrease in
 average fares primarily due to lower baggage penetration rates.Load
 factor decreased by 1% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2007.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
 by 30% to EUR175.4m in the quarter. This performance reflects the growth in
 onboard sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 48% to EUR823.0m primarily due to the 109%
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and the increased costs
 associated with the growth of the airline. Total operating expenses were also
 adversely impacted by a 1% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 13% to EUR79.6m.  This primarily reflects a 29%
 increase in average employee numbers to 6,462. Cabin crew, who earn lower than
 the average salary, accounted for the vast majority of the increase.

Depreciation and amortisation increased by 20% to EUR49.7m. This reflects, net of

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW TRAPANI BASE
 REVERSES PLANS FOR FORLI BASE
1M PASSENGERS & 1,000 JOBS FOR TRAPANI
 500,000 PASSENGERS & 500 JOBS LOST FOR FORLI
 15,000 EUR10 SEATS FOR TRAVEL IN MAY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 30th October 2008)
 announced that from May 2009 it will base two aircraft at Trapani and confirmed
 that it will not open a base at Forli after the airport withdrew the agreement
 it had reached with Ryanair. Despite the decision not to operate from Forli,
 Ryanair continues to grow strongly in Italy and the new Trapani base will create
 2 new domestic and 3 new international routes to/from the island of Sicily.
 Ryanair also announced that it will increase the frequency on two existing,
 domestic (Rome and Milan) routes as it transfers the operation of seven existing
 routes to Trapani based aircraft.
Ryanair's new routes will connect Trapani with Paris (Beauvais), Brussels
 (Charleroi), Oslo (Torp), Venice (Treviso) and Turin. Existing routes to Rome
 (Ciampino) will increase to a twice daily frequency while Milan (Bergamo) will
 increase from four frequencies per week to become a daily service.
Ryanair Holdings PLC New Trapani Base - Reverses Plans for Forli Base
Ryanair will base 2 brand new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft at Trapani which
 will operate 15 routes to/from the Sicilian airport, deliver over 1million
 passengers p.a., sustaining 1,000 local jobs, and save visitors to/from Trapani
 more than EUR100m over the high fares and fuel surcharges presently levied by
 Alitalia. Tourism in Sicily will benefit hugely with over 400,000 extra visitors
 and an injection of EUR180 million into the local economy.
Ryanair confirmed that it will now not operate the 6 new domestic routes it had
 earlier announced from Forli, after the board of the airport withdrew the
 agreement they had reached with the airline. Ryanair expected to carry over
 500,000 passengers to/from Forli in 2009, which would have created 500 new jobs
 and generated an EUR80M visitor spend in the Emilia-Romagna region, all of which
 will now be lost as Ryanair concentrates on growing routes and passengers to/
 from its other Italian airports.  Ryanair's Forli routes were due to operate
 to/from Alghero, Bari, Cagliari, Lamezia, Olbia and Palermo from December.
 Passengers who were booked on these routes will receive a full refund.
To celebrate its new Trapani base and routes, Ryanair released 15,000 EUR10 (all
 inclusive) seats on their five new routes for travel in May 2009. These seats
 (which include all taxes and charges) are available for booking on
 www.ryanair.com until midnight Thursday, 6th November next.
Announcing their latest Italian expansion, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
"Trapani becomes Ryanair's latest Italian base at a time when Italy becomes
 Ryanair's second largest market after the UK.  This exciting development comes
 just one week after we announced two new bases in Sardinia and increased
 frequencies and routes in Rome, Milan and Bologna.  Ryanair is the No.1
 international airline in Italy, carrying more international passengers to/from
 Italy than Alitalia.
"We very much regret the decision by the board of Forli airport to rescind  its
 agreement with Ryanair, but highlight that in the long term it will be
 passengers, the local economy and the airport that will lose out as we bring our
 guaranteed lowest airfares to other Italian airports and bases.  Ryanair will
 continue to grow its domestic operations in Italy, in a market where passengers
 have been ripped off for many years by Alitalia's high fares, fuel surcharges
 and strike ridden services. Only Ryanair guarantees the lowest fares and no fuel
 surcharges in Italy, which is why Ryanair continues to be the fastest growing
 and the largest airline carrying people to/from Italy.
"Ryanair's growth in Italy is all the more important now that Alitalia and Air
 One are merging to form a higher fare, fuel surcharging, domestic monopoly.
 Thanks to Ryanair's new bases, routes and frequencies, many more Italian
 consumers now have a real choice between Alitalia's high fare, fuel surcharging
 flights or Ryanair's lowest fare, no fuel surcharge flights. We remain confident
Ryanair Holdings PLC New Trapani Base - Reverses Plans for Forli Base
 that millions of Italian domestic passengers will continue to switch from
 Alitalia to Ryanair in the coming months and years".

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES STERLING RESCUE FARE*
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 29th October
 2008), launched a EUR100 rescue fare for Sterling passengers who may have been
 left stranded by the bankruptcy of the Nordic airline yesterday. This fare
 applies to flights returning to Aarhus, Billund, Gothenburg, Oslo (Torp) and
 Stockholm (Skavsta).
Ryanair also pledged to assist with the repatriation of passengers who may be
 caught up in any future airline collapse as it advised passengers that the best
 way to ensure travel plans are protected is to travel only with financially
 secure airlines.
Ryanair's rescue fare can be booked via the Ryanair website at
 (www.ryanair.com/member/sterlingrescuefare.html) until Wednesday,
 5th November, and applies to stranded Sterling passengers only.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Sterling today failed it passengers by leaving them stranded thousands of miles
 from home. This underlines the risk of flying with an airline that is not
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Launches Sterling Rescue Fare
 financially stable and is unable to guarantee its survival in tough economic
 times.
"Ryanair will help these stranded passengers return home as we launched our
 Sterling Rescue Fare. This fare can be booked from today until 5th November for
 travel on our Scandinavian routes up to the 7thNovember.  Ryanair has the
 biggest route network in Europe making it easier for stranded Sterling
 passengers to find a local airport and return home.
"Sterling passengers can book their trip back home for only EUR100 including taxes
 and charges. This rescue fare can be booked via www.ryanair.comuntil Wednesday
 night, 5th November.
"Ryanair strongly advises all passengers to book airfares only with financially
 stable airlines. By booking with Ryanair you will secure the guaranteed lowest
 fares and no fuel surcharges and can be sure that Ryanair will still be flying
 when your flight date arrives.  With over EUR2billion in cash reserves Ryanair is
 one of the most financially robust airlines in Europe".
* This fare must be booked via
 www.ryanair.com/member/sterlingrescuefare.html and passengers must quote their
 Sterling booking reference and bring the same for verification at the airport
 check-in point. Passengers who arrive to check-in without their Sterling booking
 reference cannot be accepted for travel.

 RYANAIR CALLS ON AIR BERLIN AND LUFTHANSA TO REDUCE THEIR UNFAIR SURCHARGES AS
 OIL FALLS OVER 50% TO $60 PER BARREL
 RELEASES 1 MILLION, EUR1 SEATS ON SALE FOR TRAVEL NOV - JAN
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Monday, 27th October 2008)
 celebrated the start of its third German domestic route from Berlin to
 Dusseldorf and the launch of its 800th European route from Dusseldorf to
 Bologna, with a press conference in Berlin at which Ryanair called on Air Berlin
 and Lufthansa to reduce their unfair fuel surcharges by at least 50% to reflect
 the recent 55% fall in oil prices from over $140 to less than $70 per barrel.
 Ryanair believes it is unfair that German consumers are still suffering high
 fuel surcharges at Air Berlin and Lufthansa which were last increased when oil
 was $140 a barrel and said that the failure of these German airlines to reduce
 fuel surcharge in line with the recent dramatic fall in oil prices exposes yet
 again the fact that Air Berlin and Lufthansa are overcharging consumers.
Ryanair, which will carry 9 million passengers to/from Germany this year on its
 137 German routes continues to grow rapidly in Germany thanks to Ryanair's
 unique combination of guaranteed lowest fares, guarantee of no fuel surcharges
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS A BERLIN/LUFT TO CUT SURCHARGES
 and better punctuality and customer service than that delivered by either
 Lufthansa or Air Berlin. Ryanair confirmed that its Berlin passenger numbers
 have grown by 50% in the last year, while its three German bases at (Bremen,
 Dusseldorf Weese and Frankfurt Hahn) continue to grow strongly as German
 passengers/visitors abandon high fare airlines like Air Berlin and Lufthansa in
 favour of Ryanair's lowest fares and guarantee of no surcharges.
To celebrate Ryanair's rapid German market growth, its third German domestic
 route and its 800th European route, Ryanair today released 1 million, EUR1 seats
 (incl. taxes and charges) for travel from 15th November to 31st January next.
 These seats go on sale from midnight Monday 27th until Midnight Thursday 30th
 October, and mean that German consumers/visitors travelling from any of
 Ryanair's ten German airports can now travel all over Europe in November,
 December and January for as little as EUR1, which is less than one twentieth of
 the fuel surcharges being levied by Air Berlin and Lufthansa on their German
 domestic routes.

Speaking in Berlin today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair's growth in Berlin and in Germany has never been faster, or more
 important for German consumers and visitors. With Air Berlin and Lufthansa
 continuing to charge high fares and unfair fuel surcharges and the failure of
 these airlines to reduce these surcharges despite the 50% plus fall in fuel
 prices in recent months, it is now more important than ever that Ryanair gives
 German consumers and visitors a real choice over the high fare, fuel surcharging
 German airlines. German consumers/visitors have in recent months come to realise
 that the only way to avoid high fares and fuel surcharges is to book their
 travel on www.ryanair.com and fly on any one of Ryanair's 137 German routes from
 our 10 German airports including Berlin, Frankfurt Hahn, Bremen,
 Friedrichshafen, Hamburg, Rostock, Leipzig, Dusseldorf Weeze, Zweibrucken and
 Karlsruhe.
"Ryanair calls on the German Consumer Agencies or the useless Competition
 Organisation to ask Air Berlin and Lufthansa why despite the 50% fall in oil
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS A BERLIN/LUFT TO CUT SURCHARGES
 prices, they still haven't reduced their unfair and unjustified fuel surcharges.
 Why for example when Ryanair can offer a million seats for just EUR1, are Air
 Berlin still charging a short-haul fuel surcharge of EUR25 and Lufthansa charging
 EUR24.  Clearly these German airlines are using fuel surcharges as another excuse
 to overcharge passengers, which is what is driving more and more passengers
 towards Ryanair, and maintaining Ryanair's record route and traffic growth in
 the German market.
"To celebrate Ryanair's third domestic German route and our 800th European
 route, we are releasing 1 million, EUR1 seats for travel in November, December and
 January tonight at midnight. These seats will be available for booking all day
 Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, but we advise all passengers only to book these
 EUR1 flights
 directly  www.ryanair.com and avoid any screenscraper, ticket-tout websites who
 may try to deceive consumers by adding on unauthorised and hidden handling fees
 of between 10 or 20 times Ryanair's ticket prices".
The message for Germany today from Ryanair is "Guten Tag" Ryanair's lowest
 fares, "Auf Wiedersehen" Air Berlin and Lufthansa's high, unfair fuel
 surcharges.

 VALENCIA LOSES 750,000 PASSENGERS
 AND 750 JOBS AS RYANAIR CLOSES BASE
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, today (24th October) announced the
 closure of its base at Valencia following the refusal of the Comunitat
 Valenciana to engage in constructive discussions in relation to the promotion of
 the airport and its routes across Ryanair's network in Europe. The closure will
 lead to a loss of over 70 weekly Ryanair flights, 750,000 passengers p.a. and
 over 750 jobs in the region.
Ryanair's investment of over $140m will be moved to another base in its network
 which will be announced next week.
Ryanair announced its new base in Valencia in August 2007 and has increased its
 passenger traffic by over 25% this year to an expected annual outcome of 1.5m
 passengers (out of a total of 6m at the airport). Ryanair's base represented the
 bulk of growth at Valencia Airport over the last two years and, due to the fact
 that almost all the routes were from international destinations, provided a
 massive tourism boost throughout the region.
Since the establishment of the base, Ryanair has been seeking to cooperate with
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Closes Valencia Base
 the tourism department of the Comunitat Valenciana with a view to promoting the
 region across Europe. At the same time as the Comunitat Valenciana was telling
 Ryanair that no funds were available for such cooperative activity, they were
 granting a EUR12m award of marketing support to the local airline, Air Nostrum,
 who delivered neither growth nor international passengers to the region.
 Furthermore, the Comunitat Valenciana ignored Ryanair's request for engagement
 on these important promotional issues and indeed more recently turned down all
 reasonable requests for meetings.
This blanket refusal to engage with the largest low fares and fastest growing
 airline in Europe, contrasts sharply with the attitude of the vast majority of
 other government and regional tourist authorities throughout Europe who actively
 seek Ryanair's business at their airports. This recognition of the ability of
 Ryanair to deliver tourism growth contrasts sharply with the negative attitude
 which the airline encountered in Valencia.
Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said:
"This is a very black day for the airport of Valencia and the city and region
 which it serves. Ryanair had begun to transform this once overlooked region of
 Spanish tourism into a powerhouse of growth and development. Without any
 assistance or cooperation from the local tourism board, Ryanair has already
 shown the possibilities which are uniquely available through its low fares.
 However, the naked subsidisation by the Comunitat Valenciana of competitor
 airlines at the expense of Ryanair and the refusal by the same party to engage
 in any meaningful discussion with Ryanair have meant that continuation of our
 base at the airport is untenable. We have already received numerous enquiries
 right across Europe and we will be announcing a new base elsewhere next week
 with these two aircraft.
"We will maintain limited operations to Valencia Airport from other bases and
 should the Comunitat Valenciana wish to engage with Ryanair in the future, we
 would be prepared to commence sensible discussions and indeed if conditions were
 appropriate to even recommence a base operation at Valencia".
The following flights will be cancelled as a result of the closure of the
 Valencia base:

 BAA'S SEPTEMBER TRAFFIC DECLINE PROVES THE FAILURE OF THIS HIGH COST,
 INEFFICIENT MONOPOLY SAYS RYANAIR
Ryanair, the UK's largest airline today (Tuesday, 21st October 2008) welcomed
 the release of September traffic figures by the BAA airport monopoly in the UK
 which showed passenger numbers falling by 5% to 13.3m in September. The BAA
 monopoly's traffic decline is in marked contrast to Ryanair's booming traffic
 growth (up 20% in September to 5.3m passengers).
The reason for this traffic decline is the failure of the BAA airport monopoly's
 policy of increasing passenger charges and providing abject customer services
 which at Stansted comprises long security queues, frequent baggage belt
 breakdowns and excessive passport queues which frequently results in 1 to 2 hour
 delays for British citizens returning to the UK through Stansted.
Ryanair dismissed the BAA's claims that the long-term growth prospects at the
 BAA's high cost, badly run monopoly airports are "good". In fact they are awful.
 These September traffic figures prove that the BAA monopoly is damaging British
 air transport, and British tourism. Ryanair confirmed that the Stansted traffic
 decline of 5% will worsen substantially this Winter, as Ryanair grounds up to 14
 of its 40 Stansted based aircraft solely because of BAA Stansted's high and
Ryanair Holdings PLC BAA's Sept Traffic Decline - Inefficient Monopoly
 unjustified passenger charges (which have more than doubled over the past 18
 months).
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"The BAA's traffic figures which declined by 5% in September prove yet again
 that high cost, price increasing, badly run airport monopolies like the BAA
 simply don't work. Having almost doubled passenger charges at Stansted over the
 past 18 months, it is no surprise that passenger numbers are declining at the
 BAA's airports, while traffic in Ryanair, and at other more competitive airports
 across the UK has continued to grow in September.
"These declining passenger numbers provide yet further evidence of the urgent
 need to break up the BAA airport monopoly, as recently recommended by the UK
 Competition Authorities. Forcing Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted into separate
 ownership will lead to a more competitive environment, lower passenger charges,
 improved passenger services and the roll out of additional and much needed
 capacity at more competitive prices than the marble Taj Mahals designed and
 built by the BAA monopoly.
"These declining BAA traffic figures (which will get worse as we move through
 the Winter) prove yet again that the BAA monopoly has failed British tourism, it
 has failed its airline users, it has failed consumers, and it must now be broken
 up in order to allow competition to provide efficient facilities and lower costs
 where the BAA monopoly has patently failed".

 RYANAIR REFERS BP PROFITEERING AT BELFAST CITY AND PRESTWICK AIRPORTS TO UK OFT
 AIR BP IMPOSES MONOPOLY COST INCREASES OF
 OVER 50% TIMES INFLATION
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 16th October 2008)
 called on the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate Air BP's
 unjustified attempts to impose monopoly increases of over 50% on the delivery
 cost of aviation fuel at Belfast City and Glasgow Prestwick airports - when
 inflation is less than 5%. Air BP has a complete monopoly at both of these
 airports.
Ryanair has written to Air BP to request an explanation for these rapacious
 increases but Air BP has refused to provide any valid justification, claiming
 that the increases are due to "the rising cost of oil" (from which the BP
 already makes massive profits), among other baseless excuses. At a time when the
 oil companies are making billions in profits each week from record high oil
 prices, delivery charges should actually be reducing, not increasing (by over
 ten times the rate of inflation).
Ryanair has called on the OFT to take immediate action against this blatant
 profiteering and abuse of monopoly by Air BP.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Refers BP Profiteering to UK OFT
Ryanair's Director Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
"This is the kind of blatant abuse of a monopoly position that the OFT was
 established to deal with. Air BP has a complete monopoly on the supply of
 aviation fuel at these airports and is abusing this position to unilaterally
 impose over 50% cost increases (over 10 times the rate of inflation) for the
 delivery of aviation fuel. This abuse comes at a time when BP and the other oil
 majors are making record billion pound profits at the expense of the aviation
 industry, which is currently in crisis. Despite repeated requests, Air BP has
 failed to provide any valid justification for these inflation busting increases.
"Of the 150 airports at which Ryanair currently operates to, Belfast City and
 Prestwick are the only two airports where Air BP has a complete monopoly and
 where they are subjecting users to this kind of profiteering at a time of record
 oil prices and oil company profits.
"We are therefore calling on the OFT to take immediate action against Air BP and
 prevent them from imposing these abusive and unjustified increases. At a time of
 recession, when consumer confidence is collapsing, this kind of blatant abuse by
 a massively profitable oil company cannot be accepted.
"Belfast City Airport has made it known to us that if AirBP and Ryanair are
 unable to agree on pricing, then they will be looking at introducing alternative
 suppliers.  The airport has told us that there has been no increase in
 infrastructure costs imposed by the airport nor has there been expenditure on
 any facilities which justifies this cost increase".

 Ryanair MAY CLOSE VALENCIA BASE DUE TO REGIONAL GOVERNMENT'S FAILURES
 Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 14th October 2008)
 announced that it may be forced to close its Valencia base following the failure
 of Regional Government (Conselleria de Turisme) to reply to Ryanair's proposal
 on how to ensure the continued growth of passengers at Valencia and their
 repeated failure to meet with Ryanair.
Ryanair has set a deadline of this coming Friday, 17th October for a response
 from the Government before it makes its final decision on the future of its base
 at Valencia airport.
Since Ryanair began flying to Valencia in 2004 passenger numbers have increased
 each year. Ryanair currently operates 22 international routes to and from
 Valencia, all of which are at risk if Ryanair must close all operations to/from
 Valencia.
Ryanair is the largest airline flying to Valencia but, despite its importance to
 the local economy, the government has opted to support other airlines that have
 not provided a fraction of the growth which Ryanair has to the airport. Instead
 it has chosen to ignore all efforts by Ryanair to collaborate in ensuring the
 continued growth in passenger traffic at the airport.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair May Close Valencia Base
Speaking today, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said:
"Ryanair has once again proven that it is the lowest fares, best punctuality and
 fewest lost bags that passengers really want. That is why over one and a half
 million passengers will choose Ryanair this year to travel to/from Valencia.  It
 is madness that the Regional Government is risking the livelihoods of the
 tourism industry by ignoring our repeated attempts to meet with them.
"Ryanair calls on the Regional Government of Valencia to act in the best
 interest of all those living and working in Valencia and to meet with Ryanair to
 agree the terms under which we can continue to grow traffic and passenger
 numbers with all its consequential economic and social benefits".

 RYANAIR CALLS ON EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO REDUCE REGULATORY BURDEN AND COSTS ON
 AIRLINES TO STIMULATE LOWER FARES FOR CONSUMERS DURING THIS RECESSION
 RYANAIR RELEASES OVER 1 MILLION EUR10 SEATS FOR MID-WEEK TRAVEL IN NOVEMBER AND
 DECEMBER TO KEEP EUROPE FLYING
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (14th October) called on the
 European Commission to reduce the regulatory burden and costs on airlines and
 tackle anti-consumer scams such as fuel surcharges and screenscraper mis-selling
 in order to keep Europe's air fares low during this recession, as consumer
 confidence plummets.
Ryanair remains the only European airline to guarantee the lowest fares on every
 route it operates (as well as guaranteeing no fuel surcharges). Ryanair has
 written to the European Commission drawing its attention to the fact that oil
 prices have fallen by over 50% in recent months, yet many high fares airlines
 including British Airways, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus have failed to reduce their
 unjustified fuel surcharges at all. There is no doubt that these airlines are
 using non discretionary and unavoidable fuel surcharges to scam money unfairly
 from consumers, despite the fact that they are now enjoying much lower oil
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call For EU Commission To Reduce Regulatory Burden
 prices.
Ryanair also called on the EU Commission to take action to protect Europe's
 consumers from screenscrapers, many of whom are engaged in unauthorised breaches
 of copyright and unlawfully accessing websites such as Ryanair.com, and in the
 case of Rumbo.com in Spain (for example) are over charging consumers by up to 50
 times the underlying Ryanair fares, as well as adding large hidden mark-ups
 (unknown to consumers) to some of Ryanair's discretionary service fees.
Ryanair also called on the EU Commission to urgently address and reverse many of
 the expensive, anti-consumer regulations introduced in recent years which have
 added significantly to the cost of all air travel within Europe, while
 delivering minimal passengers benefits. Such measures would include:
· Promoting a single EU air traffic management system which would reduce the
 current EUR7bn annual
 cost  by as much as EUR5bn p.a., as well as reducing
 passenger delays, fuel consumption and emissions.
 ·Scraping the EU261 passenger compensation legislation which is discriminatory
 in that they
 only apply to airlines, but not to competing ferries, trains
 or buses. This legislation should be replaced
 with legislation to  outlaw
 over-booking of flights, which would be a cheap and effective way of
ensuring that no passenger is denied access to a flight once booked.
 ·Scrap the PRM regulation which was introduced last year and have allowed many
 monopoly airports to
 increase the handling costs of disabled passengers by
 up to 400%. At Dublin Airport for example
 Ryanair's PRM costs which were
 less than 10c a passenger when the service was being provided by
 Ryanair,
 has now exploded to over 45c per passenger, because it is provided by an
 inefficient, over-
 charging profiteering airport monopoly.
 ·Scrap the proposed airport charging directive which was formulated by the
 European Commission
 following its flawed decision in the Charleroi case.
 As the current sale discussions
 for Charleroi Airport indicate, not alone
 was the EU Commission's analysis fundamentally wrong,
 but Charleroi
 Airport has been consistently profitable and is now the subject of a number of
 private
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call For EU Commission To Reduce Regulatory Burden
 sector offers for the airport due entirely to the success of
 Ryanair's low cost base and rapid traffic
 growth at Charleroi.
 ·Scrap the 7 State Aid investigations against Ryanair's contracts at small
 regional airports
 including: Alghero, Pau, Frankfurt Hahn, among others,
 given that the current profitability and sale
 of Charleroi proves that
 there was no basis for the EU Commission's erroneous finding of State Aid in
the Charleroi case.
Speaking today in Brussels, Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
"The European Airline Industry is now facing a greater challenge and a more
 difficult trading environment than any time over the past 50 years. The European
 economy is in recession, consumer confidence and spending has collapsed and we
 need real leadership from the EU Commission if we are to keep Europe flying and
 keep delivering lower fares with no fuel surcharges for Europe's consumers.
"At a time when many of Europe's airlines have collapsed or are merging to form
 stronger airline groups, perhaps it's time for the European Commission to
 reconsider its prohibition of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus in 2006.  Europe is
 moving towards a small number of big strong airline groups which is the only way
 these airlines can survive the current financial turmoil and to provide
 passengers with real choice of air services into the future. Surely if Alitalia
 and AirOne can be combined to form a strong airline group in Italy, then it's
 time to allow Ryanair and Aer Lingus to combine to form one equally strong Irish
 airline group.
"The EU Commission can do much to lead the airline industry over the coming
 months and years. Costs can be significantly reduced if unnecessary and
 expensive regulations are done away with, particularly the complicated and
 inefficient air traffic management systems of Europe. Similarly the passenger
 compensation provisions should be replaced with a simple ban on airline
 overbookings, the PRM regulation should allow airlines to provide their own PRM
 services, which we can do at a fraction of the costs that are now being imposed
 on airlines and passengers by inefficient, profiteering airports such as Dublin
 and clearly the whole area of environmental taxes should now be reversed, given
 that both economic activity and oil consumption is in significant decline.
 Airline capacity is being reduced and Europe's consumers simply cannot afford to
 pay these unjustified and inequitable taxes on air tickets at a time when
 Europe's economy and our tourism industry are in recession.
Ryanair has shown the way forward in these difficult times by continuing to
 guarantee the lowest fares and no fuel surcharges. We have seen our profits
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call For EU Commission To Reduce Regulatory Burden
 collapse from EUR480m last year to perhaps break even this year as we absorbed
 these higher oil prices and regulatory costs. We would now like to work with the
 EU Commission and the rest of the industry to examine ways in which these simple
 measures could increase efficiency and lower costs for Europe's hard pressed
 consumers during the current recession. Ryanair has been one of the great
 success stories of European integration. Our lowest fares have allowed almost 60
 million passengers to save over EUR6bn annually by flying Ryanair's low cost,
 on-time flights as compared to the high fare, fuel surcharging delayed flights
 provided by our flag carrier competitors."

PROPOSED TRAVEL TAX (IF IMPLEMENTED) WILL DEVASTATE SHANNON SAYS RYANAIR
Ryanair, Ireland's largest low fares airline today (Monday, 13th October 2008)
 responded to weekend speculation that the Irish Government will introduce a new
 EUR10 (air) travel tax in Tuesday's budget by expressing concerns (a) that it will
 be discriminatory, if it doesn't apply to competing ferry traffic, (b) that it
 will be double taxation of the unfairest kind at Dublin Airport, where the
 Government owned DAA monopoly is already taxing each departing passenger over
 EUR15 per ticket and (c) if this rumoured EUR10 tax (which in many cases exceeds the
 average air fare at Shannon) will deal a devastating blow to the recent growth
 in low fare traffic to/from Shannon.
In responding to this week's probable tax increases in the Irish budget, Ryanair
 said that while it would be disappointed if such a disproportionate tax is
 levied on air passengers to/from Ireland, it is clear in the current environment
 that everyone, including air passengers would have to shoulder a reasonable
 proportion of this burden. However Ryanair said it would be entirely unfair for
 the Government to levy such a high rate of tax (a EUR10 tax equates to a 25% rate
 of tax on Ryanair's average EUR40 fare) if at the same time the Government owned
 DAA monopoly continues to rip air passengers off with up to EUR15 per departing
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Travel Tax Will Devastate Shannon
 passenger at Dublin. Ryanair is calling on the Government to use its ownership
 of the DAA monopoly to ensure that these excessive and uncompetitive taxes at
 Dublin Airport were reduced by at least 50% (or EUR7.00 per ticket), in order to
 help consumers shoulder at least some of this burden of increased taxation and
 to avoid Government double taxation at Dublin Airport.
Ryanair is also concerned that this taxation (if it only applies to air travel)
 will be discriminatory against air passengers, if it does not apply to competing
 ferry passengers. Ryanair called on the Government to level the playing field by
 applying a similar rate of travel tax to ferry traffic which from an
 environmental point of view accounts for double the rate of C02 emissions in the
 EU than air transport. The European Environmental Agency has confirmed that
 marine traffic accounts for some 5% of European C02 emissions, compared to air
 traffic which accounts for less than 2%. If this tourism tax is to be dressed up
 as an environmental measure, then Ryanair believes it should apply equally to
 ferry passengers, as well as air passengers in order to avoid distorting the
 market against air travel.
Ryanair expressed its greatest concern at the effect that any such proposed
 travel tax will have on its low fare (loss making) base at Shannon. In the
 current year Ryanair expects to carry almost 1.9 million passengers to/from
 Shannon, however for 5 months of the year, the average fare paid by these
 passengers at Shannon is less than EUR10 per passenger. Accordingly this traffic
 simply cannot sustain a tax rate of over 100% (if a EUR10 air travel tax, is
 introduced) and if this tax is applied to low fare passengers travelling to/from
 Shannon, then it is inevitable that short-haul traffic to/from Shannon will
 collapse. Ryanair simply cannot deliver up to 2 million passengers annually at
 Shannon, if the average fares paid by these (mainly) visitor numbers, is to be
 increased by more than 100%, as a result of a travel tax. Ryanair called on the
 Government to review this tax in the case of Shannon Airport, since price
 sensitive passengers simply won't travel to Shannon from Europe if a Government
 travel tax results in average air fares to/from Shannon being more than doubled.
 Ryanair will be seeking an urgent meeting with the Minister for Transport after
 Tuesday's budget to outline its concerns about the impact of any such tax on
 Shannon Airport, which may lead to a substantial reassessment of Ryanair's $400m
 investment in Shannon and the continuation of its loss making operations there.
Commenting on this weekend's speculation about a travel tax, Ryanair's Michael
 O'Leary said:
"It is not unreasonable that everybody in Ireland (incl. passengers) must play
 some part in shouldering the burden of the current downturn in Government
 finances. However,  we would ask the Government to ensure that air passengers
 are not unfairly discriminated against in any such measures. We would ask the
 Government to avoid double taxing air passengers at Dublin by ensuring that the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Travel Tax Will Devastate Shannon
 current high charges at Dublin Airport (presently EUR15 per departing passenger)
 are reduced by at least 50% to EUR7.50 per departing passenger in order to avoid
 double taxation at Dublin Airport. There is no doubt that the substantial EUR800m
 asset sale windfalls recently enjoyed by the DAA monopoly can enable them to
 lower these excessive passenger charges at a time of increasing travel tax.
"We would also call for a level playing field if any such tax is introduced and
 a similar level of tax being applied to ferry passengers in order to avoid
 discriminating against air passengers and in favour of ferry passengers.
"Finally, we will be seeking an urgent meeting with the Minister for Transport
 to outline the devastating impact that any flat rate travel tax will have on
 Ryanair's low fare, loss making base at Shannon. Given that average fares at
 Shannon for 5 months of the year are less than EUR10 per passenger, this tax will
 cause visitor numbers at Shannon to collapse. We will be asking the Government
 to consider altering the basis of this passenger tax to make it a percentage (of
 the fare) rate of tax, rather than a flat rate of tax, which would mean that
 passengers paying higher fares at Dublin Airport will pay slightly more, whereas
 passengers travelling at extremely low fares to/from Shannon will pay
 proportionately less. It is important that this tax burden fall on those who can
 afford to pay it, and those choosing to pay higher fares should pay a slightly
 higher rate of tax, but those paying the lowest fares should pay a similar rate
 of tax, but not as speculated this weekend a EUR10 tax which at Shannon will
 equate to over a 100% rate of tax for large parts of the year".

RYANAIR'S GUARDED WELCOME FOR CAPACITY INCREASE AT STANSTED
SALE OF STANSTED AND COMPETITION NOW EVEN MORE URGENT
Ryanair, London Stansted Airport's largest airline today, (Thursday, 9th October
 2008) gave a guarded welcome to the UK Governments decision to allow traffic at
 Stansted to be increased from 25m to 35m p.a. However, Ryanair warned that this
 traffic increase will only add to the lengthy security queues, frequent baggage
 belt breakdowns and excessive passport control queues if the BAA monopoly's
 mismanagement is allowed to continue at Stansted. Ryanair again calls for the
 urgent sale of Stansted by the BAA monopoly (as recommended recently by the UK
 competition authorities) to ensure that competition delivers this increased
 capacity in a passenger friendly, cost efficient manner, something the BAA
 monopoly have repeatedly refused to do.
Ryanair pointed out that under the BAA's monopoly, costs at Stansted have more
 than doubled over the past 2 years, and traffic is now declining. There will be
 no need for this extra capacity if the BAA monopoly continue to own and
 mismanage Stansted as costs will keep rising, passenger service will get even
 worse and traffic will continue to decline.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Guarded Welcome For Capacity Increase at Stansted
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
"While we cautiously welcome the Government's decision to increase passenger
 capacity at Stansted, it just highlights the urgent need for the BAA monopoly to
 be forced to sell Stansted to promote competition. Under the BAA monopoly costs
 at Stansted have more than doubled in the last 2 years, traffic is in decline
 and the passenger service (with long queues at security and passport control, as
 well as frequent baggage belt breakdowns) goes from bad to even worse.
"Only a new owner, new management and competition between the London airports
 can improve the lot of passengers at Stansted by delivering this capacity growth
 at lower cost with more efficient facilities and better customer service,
 something the BAA monopoly have repeatedly refused to deliver at Stansted.
"The BAA Stansted monopoly continues to abuse passengers and airlines in
 Stansted with high costs and low service. Today's Government's decision to
 permit increased capacity at Stansted must be accompanied by greater competition
 and the early sale of the airport if the airport is finally to deliver improved
 service at lower costs and the ending of long queues and 3rd world service to
 passengers and airlines at Stansted".

 Ryanair Welcomes Court Decision to Refuse Passenger Compensation
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Monday, 6th October 2008)
 welcomed the decision of Simmern Court in Germany to dismiss a passenger's
 compensation claim after Ryanair was forced to cancel a flight due to unsafe
 weather conditions in Jerez in October last year.
The German court found that bad weather prevented Ryanair from landing safely
 and represented extraordinary circumstances which were beyond the control of the
 airline under EU261 regulations.
The passenger, who was seeking compensation of over EUR1,600 as a result of this
 forced cancellation, had his claim dismissed by Simmern Court.  The passenger
 must now settle all costs associated with the case, including Ryanair's costs.
Welcoming the finding, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"The decision of the court was in accordance with the provisions of EU261.  We
 understand that cancelled flights can be frustrating. However, we must always
 make decisions which prioritise the safety of our passengers, crew and aircraft.
"In this case bad weather made it unsafe to land at Jerez and we had no
Ryanair Holdings PLC Court Decision to Refuse Passenger Compensation
 alternative but to cancel the return flight.  We welcome this decision which
 clarifies the fact that EU261 compensation claims do not arise in cases where
 bad weather forces airlines to put passenger safety ahead of passenger
 convenience".

 Ryanair's SEPTEMBER SALES SOar
 20% INCREASE IN SEPTEMBER PASSENGER NUMBERS
WILL BANKERS BE NEXT TO TURN TO RYANAIR?
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airline today (Friday, 3rd October 2008)
 announced that 5.23 million passengers travelled with them in September, a 20%
 increase over September 2007.  Ryanair carried just over 56 million passengers
 in the year to September 2007.
Ryanair's continued growth underlines that passengers will no longer tolerate
 the high fares and fuel surcharges imposed by flag carrier airlines, such as Air
 France, British Airways, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus. Ryanair believes that these
 airlines face a bleak winter and a continuing exodus of passengers to Ryanair's
 guaranteed lowest fares.
The following are Ryanair's passenger and load factor statistics for September
 2008.

Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said:
"Having achieved record passenger numbers throughout the summer we showed no
 sign of slowdown in September with 5.23million passengers taking advantage of
 Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharge.
A lot of price sensitive leisure passengers have switched from rival, high fares
 airlines, to Ryanair. However, in light of the current crisis in banking and
 financial institutions we are confident that we will soon seen more bankers
 migrate to Ryanair also.  Tougher economic times will see these bankers tighten
 the purse strings and save time and money by taking advantage of our guaranteed
 lowest fares and our unrivalled punctuality".

RYANAIR LAUNCHES STATE AID COMPLAINT AGAINST LATEST
 UNLAWFUL ALITALIA BAILOUT
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 2nd October, 2008)
 announced that it had submitted a formal complaint to the EU Commission
 regarding the latest unlawful bailout of the failed Italian national carrier,
 Alitalia.
 Ryanair's action comes after the Italian Government announced
 that it had reached agreement with Alitalia's unions regarding an offer made by
 a consortium of Italian investors (CAI). The deal calls for another farcical
 renaming of Alitalia and writing off between EUR1.2 and EUR2bln worth of its debt in
 order to secure investors.
Ryanair has previously submitted several complaints against Alitalia and other
 flag carrier airlines, including Olympic, Air France and Lufthansa, against
 which the EU Commission has taken no action.  Ryanair highlighted that this
 ongoing unlawful protection of flag carriers by their member state governments,
 which amounts to billions of euro, increasingly makes a mockery of the EU
 Commission's enforcement of the state aid rules.
Ryanair Holdings PLC State Aid Complaint Against Alitalia Bailout
Announcing the complaint, Ryanair's Director of Legal and Regulatory Affairs,
 Jim Callaghan, said:
"This is the latest and perhaps most blatant example of the Italian Government
 doing whatever it takes to protect their failed airline, Alitalia.  It is also
 the second time that they have used the trick of simply shifting debt out of the
 airline and into a subsidiary in order to keep the airline afloat. In this
 instance, the Italian government is writing off up to EUR2bln. in Alitalia debts
 and is guaranteeing the investments by the members of the consortium and
 underwriting huge concessions to the unions in exchange for their agreement to
 these ludicrous plans.
"However, despite the blatant nature of the Italian Government's breaches of the
 EU state aid rules, we have no doubt that the EU Commission will again rubber
 stamp this unlawful bailout, as they did 3 years ago and more recently in a
 similar case involving Olympic. In such case, Ryanair will appeal this decision
 to the European courts to expose the corrupt and biased application by the
 Commission of its own state aid rules.
"Ryanair has already been forced to take several cases against the Commission
 for its failure to take action against other blatant breaches of the state aid
 rules by member state governments to protect and bail out their inefficient flag
 carriers. These repeated failures by the Commission are contributing to a
 massively distorted playing field in European aviation.
"Ryanair will continue to expose the biased and corrupt application of the state
 aid rules by the European Commission to ensure that economically and
 environmentally unsustainable airlines like Alitalia and Olympic Airways are
 forced to exit the market - which is what is supposed to happen in a free
 market".

RYANAIR'S GUIDANCE LARGELY UNCHANGED AT AGM
5 Million EUR5 Seats on Sale for October/November
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 18th September
2008) held its AGM in Dublin to update shareholders on trading, the difficult
economic environment and recent airline industry developments in Europe.
Commenting on its outlook for the current year to 31st March 2009, Ryanair
reiterated that it expected to carry just over 58 million passengers. The
Company did not significantly alter its full year guidance which has improved
from the previous "breakeven to minus EUR60m" to a current "breakeven" based on
Q.4 oil remaining at $100 per barrel (down from $130 p. bl) this Winter. Ryanair
welcomed the recent fall in oil prices. It has hedged most of its Q.3
requirements at $124 per barrel, but remains unhedged for Q.4. Whilst Ryanair
expects to pay less for oil in Q.4, these savings may well be eaten up by lower
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement
yields this Winter, as the UK, Irish and European economies go into recession
and consumer confidence plummets.
Ryanair will respond to these negative trends by lowering fares this Winter, and
underlined its intent by releasing 5 million seats this morning for travel in
October, and the first two weeks of November for just EUR5 one way (incl. taxes
and charges). Ryanair remains the only European airline to guarantee the lowest
fares on every route and no fuel surcharges as well.
Ryanair expects more airline bankruptcies in the coming weeks following the
recent closures of Zoom, Futura, XL Airways and the bankruptcy of Alitalia.
Ryanair believes that many unviable loss making European airlines will cease
trading this Winter because of unsustainable losses and insufficient cash
reserves. Ryanair recommends that any passengers making bookings this Winter,
should book with Ryanair, which has over EUR2 billion in cash. Ryanair called on
Europe's high fare airlines including BA, Air France, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus
to reduce their unjustified fuel surcharges to reflect the recent 38% drop in
oil prices.
Speaking at today's AGM, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
"While the recent fall in oil prices is welcome, it won't have much impact on
our full year results because we have already hedged Q.3 at $124 per barrel and
any Q.4 fuel savings may be absorbed by lower fares and yields as we stimulate
growth in a recession this Winter. We believe there will be further airline
bankruptcies in Europe over the coming weeks, as more of Europe's non-viable,
loss making airlines run out of cash or their credit facilities are withdrawn.
"The extraordinary pace of European airline consolidation will also continue.
There is no doubt that most of Europe's flag carrier airlines will merge into
three large high fare groupings led by BA, Air France and Lufthansa this Winter.
By contrast Ryanair will continue to compete with (and beat) these mega carriers
by offering lower fares, consumer choice and better punctuality. We expect that
the European Commission will rubber-stamp approval of these mergers, which will
help Ryanair's appeal against the EU's prohibition of our 2006 much smaller
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement
merger with Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus (which is again losing money) is far too
small to survive as an independent regional airline, and we believe its future
can best be secured as part of one strong Irish airline group (where it would
continue to be separately branded and managed), rather than being a tiny
subsidiary of a high fare airline grouping controlled from London, Paris or
Frankfurt.
"We regret Aer Lingus's continuing failure to take Ryanair's
advice to lower its fares, fuel surcharges or costs. Having wasted over EUR24m of
shareholders funds rejecting an offer of EUR2.80 per share, Aer Lingus is now
forecasting substantial losses both in 2008 and 2009. Its Belfast base with an
average load factor of less than 50% has been a financial failure. We don't
believe that a Board which has almost trebled its Directors fees from EUR17,500
p.a. to EUR45,000 p.a. can credibly deliver the "fundamental changes in the
operating cost base" which are so badly needed. Perhaps they should start by
cutting these fat cat fees? Aer Lingus's future and the security of employment
of its people depends on lowering air fares and scrapping unjustified fuel
surcharges, whereas in the last two years Aer Lingus has increased both.
"Ryanair supports the UK Competition Commission's recent report which called for
the break up of the BAA airport monopoly which has damaged competition and
consumer interests in the UK. We call on the Irish Government to break up the
equally damaging DAA airport monopoly which continues to develop facilities
which users don't want, and continues to impose monopoly prices increases, way
above the rate of inflation, while Ireland's useless Aviation Regulator stands
idly by. We call again for the dismissal of Ireland's Aviation Regulator who has
failed to protect the interests of users at Dublin Airport, who did nothing
while Dublin's ATC system collapsed for 5 weeks earlier this Summer, and who has
presided over a growing number of bankruptcies of tour operator and airlines
which his office licenced as financially fit to operate. Ireland's Aviation
Regulator has been a dismal failure, and this useless quango should be closed
immediately.
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement
"Ryanair's campaign against illegal screen-scraper/ticket-tout websites (who are
unlawfully accessing Ryanair.com's website and are mis-selling Ryanair's fares
to consumers with hidden 200% and 300% mark-ups) continues. We note the failure
of the European Commission, or the consumer protection agencies of Ireland, the
UK or Europe to take any action to prevent consumers being ripped off with
these hidden mark-ups. Ryanair is continuing, to secure injunctions in Ireland,
the UK, Spain and Germany against these mis-selling ticket-touts and
cancel screen-scraper bookings which have been made in breach of Ryanair's terms
and conditions.
"Ryanair continues to grow strongly, with last month's traffic up 19% on August
2007. We expect that our continuous stream of seat sales and price promotions
which includes this morning's release of 5 million, EUR5 seats for travel in
October and the first two weeks of November, will continue to stimulate air
travel, to take market share from competitors and offer Europe's consumers a
real choice of low fares and on-time flights, when increasingly their only
alternative is high fare, fuel surcharging, regularly delayed flag carrier
services. While Ryanair's refusal to impose fuel surcharges will mean that our
profitability declines steeply in the current fiscal year, our cost reduction
programme and significantly lower oil prices (if they persist at under $100
p.bl) should lead to a return to substantial profitability in the next fiscal
year (ended March 2010)".

RYANAIR CALLS ON THE BAA MONOPOLY TO SELL STANSTED
(AND ONE OF THE SCOTTISH AIRPORTS AS WELL)
Ryanair today (Wednesday, 17th September 2008) called on the BAA airport
monopoly to comply with the UK Competition Authority's preliminary findings, and
put Stansted and at least one of the Scottish airports up for sale immediately.
Ryanair believes that this morning's announcement by the BAA that it was putting
Gatwick up for sale is just the latest attempt by this monopoly to hang on to
Stansted, and to continue to overspend on facilities which users don't want and
further increase Stansted's high charges while providing an abject service to
airlines and passengers. The UK Competition Commission had already found that
the BAA Stansted monopoly has been bad for competition and bad for consumers.
Speaking this morning in Dublin, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"This morning's announcement that the BAA monopoly is putting Gatwick up for
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Calls on the BAA Monopoly to Sell Stansted
sale is just the latest attempt by the BAA monopoly to get itself off the hook
of the Competition Commission's recommendations. Airlines and passengers have
been abused for many years with high prices and abysmal service at all of the
BAA's London and Scottish airports and the "trick" of selling off Gatwick won't
end this abusive monopoly. Ryanair calls on the Competition Commission and the
UK Government to take early steps to force the early sale of Stansted and at
least one of the Scottish airports, so that real competition can be introduced
in time for Summer 2009, and the BAA airport monopoly (which has finally been
exposed by the Competition Commission as being bad for consumers and bad for
competition) - can at last be broken up.
"The BAA monopoly wants to hang on to Heathrow and Stansted, because this is
where they continue to propose gold plated Taj Mahal facilities in the hope that
its useless regulator, the CAA , will continue to reward it with above inflation
price increases as it delivers a third rate service to airlines and passengers
The sale of Stansted will lead to the earlier development of a second runway and
terminal because these will be designed to meet the needs of users. It will also
end the current grotesque spectacle that the principal objectors to Stansted's
Taj Mahal planning applications are the Stansted airlines themselves who are
unanimously opposed to the gold plated waste being proposed by the BAA monopoly
which does not meet the needs of users.
"Users at Stansted who continue to suffer long queues at security and at
passport control, as well as above inflation price increases, continue to call
for the urgent sale of Stansted. As the BAA's August figures show, Stansted's
traffic continues to decline, as traffic and tourism is damaged by the high
cost, mismanagement of the BAA airport monopoly, who have shown nothing but
contempt for Stansted's airlines and passengers in recent months".

RYANAIR WINS RIGHT TO CHALLENGE EXCESSIVE KNOCK SUBSIDY
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, won the right today (Tuesday, 9th
September 2008) to challenge the award of the PSO subsidy on the Knock - Dublin
route to Aer Arann. Ryanair is seeking an explanation why its offer of a smaller
subsidy, lower fares and triple the passenger numbers for the Knock route was
rejected in favour of Aer Arann's larger subsidy, higher fares and fewer
passenger numbers.
The High Court in Ireland has granted Ryanair's application for a judicial
review of the decision of the Department of Transport following the unlawful
award of a PSO (Public Service Obligation) contract for the Dublin to Knock
route to Aer Arann, following Cityjet's announcement that it would not serve the
route. Ryanair today underlined that the Minister should have called for a new
tender process in order to comply with European Regulations on the grant of PSOs
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Wins Right To Challenge Knock Subsidy
but failed to do so.
Ryanair had offered to serve this route for a much lower subsidy and with over 3
times the seat capacity but the Department rejected the offer without having
carried our a new tender.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Director of Legal & Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan,
said:
"Following Cityjet's announcement that it would not fly the Dublin - Knock
route, Ryanair immediately offered to serve this route for a much lower price to
the taxpayer and with over 3 times the passenger numbers. However the
Department rejected this offer and unlawfully granted the PSO to Aer Arann
without calling for a new tender.
"Ryanair has been a vocal critic of the Department for Transport's waste of
taxpayer funds in the area of PSOs and this is the latest example. We are
delighted that the High Court has granted our request to challenge this unlawful
decision.
"At a time of economic downturn, it is high time that the Department for
Transport stopped wasting taxes on grossly inflated PSOs by supporting the
subsidy junkie Aer Arann, which does not publish accounts yet continues to
receive massive state subsidies. The Department must instead choose the value
for money option - Ryanair!"

RYANAIR'S TRAFFIC GROWTH CONTINUES
19% INCREASE IN AUGUST PASSENGER NUMBERS
LOWEST FARES AIRTRAVEL GROWING RAPIDLY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airlines today (Thursday, 4th September 2008)
announced that its passenger numbers continue to grow as Ryanair carried
almost 5.8 million passengers in August, a 19% (940,000 passenger) increase when
compared to August 2007.Ryanair has carried over 55million passengers in the
year to August 2008.
Ryanair has now increased passenger numbers every month this year while
continuing to maintain a load factor of 81%. Ryanair's load factor remained
exceptionally strong in August with 90% of available seats being snapped up by
deal hungry passengers. The load factor for August '08 was slightly down on
August '07 due to an increase in capacity over the last 12 months.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Traffic Continues To Grow
Ryanair continues to grow passenger numbers despite a Europe wide economic
slowdown which has seen high fare, fuel surcharging, airlines lose price
sensitive passengers to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharge.
Ryanair are confident that passenger numbers will continue to remain strong as
competitors continue to raise their high fares and fuel surcharges and
haemorrhage more passengers to Ryanair.
Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said:
"Ryanair's latest passenger figures show that we continue to grow passenger
numbers every month this year. Our rapidly growing passenger numbers come at a
time when many airlines, which are facing huge losses, are raising fares and
fuel surcharges in an attempt to turn these losses around. However, the reality
is that this has driven their passengers to Ryanair. Now even more passengers
realise that low fare, fuel surcharge free, travel is still possible - but only
with Ryanair. We have carried over 55million passengers in the last 12months,
proving that passengers are increasingly attracted to Ryanair's guaranteed
lowest fares and our promise of no fuel surcharges ever".
The following are Ryanair's passenger and load factor statistics for August
2008.

RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS RESULTS AND CALLS AGAIN FOR REMOVAL OF UNJUSTIFIED
FUEL SURCHARGES
Ryanair, Aer Lingus's largest shareholder today (Friday, 29th August 2008)
expressed its concern at the half year results reported by Aer Lingus yesterday.
Ryanair is deeply concerned that Aer Lingus (despite a reasonably good fuel
hedging position in 2008) appears to be forecasting a loss of some EUR70m in the
current year and that these losses may increase to over EUR100m in 2009.
Whilst Aer Lingus will doubtless continue to ignore the views of its largest
shareholder, Ryanair calls upon the Board and Management of Aer Lingus to review
its current strategy as follows:
1. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus should scrap its unjustified fuel surcharges.
It makes no sense for Aer Lingus to lose long-haul traffic to competitor
airlines because of its unjustified fuel surcharges, which have increased six
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS RESULTS
times since October 2006 (when Ryanair committed to scrapping these unnecessary
fuel surcharges). The fact that Aer Lingus's long-haul load factor has collapsed
from 77% to 67% in the half year demonstrates that this fuel surcharging policy
has failed and should be reversed.
2. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus's Belfast base has been a financial failure. As
the attached CAA traffic statistics (Jan-June 2008) confirm, Aer Lingus's load
factor at its Belfast base is an uneconomic 50%. Some of Aer Lingus's Belfast
load factors are truly awful, with Paris at 31%, Amsterdam at 36% and Nice a
very poor 38%. In all cases it would appear that Aer Lingus's load factor is
considerably lower than that of Easyjet or Jet2, its competitors at
Belfast International Airport.
3. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus's cost reduction strategy (PCIO7) has been an
abject failure. Aer Lingus's interim results confirm that its employees have
received EUR17.6m in "compensation" for claimed productivity improvements, yet
staff costs on a per passenger basis have increased during the last half year.
It's hard to believe that paying out EUR17.6m in "compensation" for unverified
productivity improvements is a sensible use of management time or shareholders
money.
4. Ryanair believes that the current Board or Management of Aer Lingus cannot
deliver "fundamental changes in the operating cost base" when over the past 12
months this Board and Management have almost trebled its Directors fees from
EUR17,500 p.a. to EUR45,000 p.a. for each director (incl. many political appointees
and senior trade unionists). Worse still the Non Executive Chairman's fees have
mushroomed fivefold from EUR35,000 in 2006 to EUR175,000 in 2007. Can any Board
whose total cost has almost doubled in the last year from EUR1.4m in 2006 to EUR2.2m
in 2007 really be capable of delivering a "fundamental change in our operating
cost base".
Commenting today, Ryanair's Spokesman, Stephen McNamara said:
"These half year results from Aer Lingus conclusively supports Ryanair's belief
that its 2006 takeover strategy for Aer Lingus was the right one. Ryanair
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS RESULTS
promised to reduce Aer Lingus's fares, scrap Aer Lingus's fuel surcharges and
reduce Aer Lingus's costs in order to secure the future of Aer Lingus within one
strong Irish airline group.
"As the current wave of European airline mergers and takeovers gathers pace, it
is clear that Aer Lingus is being marginalised on the sidelines of European
aviation, losing money, with no apparent strategy to return to profitability.
Its independence strategy, which over the past year has delivered higher fares,
a sixfold increase in its fuel surcharges, route closures in Ireland, and a
lurch to substantial losses has failed its customers, its staff and has we
believe failed to secure Aer Lingus's long-term viability".

HAMBURG COURT UPHOLDS RYANAIR INJUNCTION AGAINST UNLAWFUL SCREENSCRAPING WEBSITE
VTOURS.DE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 28th August 2008)
welcomed this morning's decision of the Hamburg Court to uphold Ryanair's
injunction against the unlawful activities of the screenscraper/ticket-tout
website Vtours.de, which was previously selling Ryanair tickets, with inflated
hidden mark-ups, to German consumers.
Vtours.de had appealed against Ryanair's original injunction and this case was
heard in the Hamburg Court last Thursday the 21st of August. In today's
judgement, the Hamburg Court has confirmed that Ryanair's injunction remains in
place, which will prevent the Vtours.de website illegally screenscraping
Ryanair's website and unlawfully selling Ryanair's tickets to its customers with
unauthorised hidden mark-ups.

Speaking today, Ryanair's Jim Callaghan said:
"We welcome this latest successful Hamburg Court decision against the Vtours.de

through this unauthorised ticket-tout website, and has called on the European
Commission, as well as National Governments to take action to prevent this
illegal and unlawful mis-selling to consumers. Sadly, we are still waiting for
the European Commission to take any action to protect consumers, but we live in
hope."

6. Do not keep consumers informed of changes in Ryanair's terms and conditions or
flight information.
7. Are regularly and consistently over-charging consumers with over 200% or 300%
hidden mark-ups on Ryanair's ticket prices.
Ryanair provided the European Commission with evidence of four specific
websites, Bravofly.com, Edreams.com, Volgratis.com, Wegelo.com in which the
airline's ticket prices had been inflated by 200% or 300%, without the consumers
knowledge, and these hidden mark-ups are billed to the consumer as if this was
the Ryanair ticket price. These specific documented examples show the following
hidden overcharging of consumers;
(a)    Bravofly.com price   EUR60.93
         Ryanair ticket priceEUR19.95
Bravofly overcharge EUR40.95 (205%)
(b)    Edreams.com price
 EUR385.97
 Airline ticket price EUR106.87
         Edreams overcharge   EUR279.10
 (260%)
(c)    Volgratis.com price    EUR63.25
         Ryanair ticket
 priceEUR25.25
         Volgratis overcharge  EUR38.00 (150%)
 (d)
 Wegolo.com price     EUR37.00
          Ryanair ticket price EUR10.00
Wegelo overcharge   EUR27.00 (370%)
Ryanair has pointed out to the European Commission that the illegal and
unauthorised activities of these screenscraper/ticket-tout websites have in
recent weeks caused dramatic slowdowns and outages on the Ryanair.com website,
resulting in bona fide consumers being unable to access Ryanair's timetables,
prices or make bookings on Ryanair.com. Ryanair also explained to the European
Commission that since it is the only airline to operate with a lowest price
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Responds to EU Queries re:Screeenscrapers
guarantee, Ryanair's guarantee becomes invalid if these ticket tout websites can
overcharge consumers with 200% or 300% hidden mark ups on Ryanair's guaranteed
lowest ticket prices.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary confirmed today:
"We have responded to the European Commission's enquiries by providing them with
documentary evidence of this unauthorised, illegal ticket-tout operation being
perpetrated on consumers by these screenscraper websites. It is remarkable, but
unsurprising, that a number of European Government agencies and the European
Commission has sought to blame Ryanair for blocking the illegal activities of
these screenscrapers, instead of tackling the real consumer scandal which is the
hidden 200% or 300% mark ups being levied and over-charged on innocent consumers
by these illegal screenscraper/ticket-tout websites.
"Since Ryanair is the only airline doing anything to eliminate this unauthorised
and illegal practice, we are now calling on the European Commission in general
and DG TREN in particular, to take action to force these unauthorised, illegal
screenscraper/ticket tout websites to desist from unlawfully overcharging
consumers by 200% or 300%, particularly when they provide no useful service to
consumers."

RYANAIR WELCOMES COMPETITION COMMISSION'S CALL
TO BREAKUP BAA AIRPORT MONOPOLY
Ryanair, Britain's largest passenger airline, today (Wednesday, 20th August
2008) welcomed the UK Competition Commission's recommendation for the breakup of
the BAA monopoly over the London airports, which will result in the three main
airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, being able to compete against each
other to provide low cost, efficient facilities and also lower prices and better
services for consumers.
Ryanair has long called for the breakup of this abusive monopoly, which ignores
the needs of airlines and the travelling public and charges rip off prices for
abysmal services. The Competition Commission's Preliminary Report confirms that
this monopoly has been bad for competition and bad for consumers. It also
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WELCOMES CALL TO BREAK UP BAA MONOPOLY
confirms that the CAA has failed to properly regulate the BAA monopoly.
Ryanair has called on the UK Government to implement the Competition
Commission's recommendations and break-up the BAA monopoly as soon as possible.
Speaking today in London, Ryanair's Director of Legal & Regulatory Affairs, Jim
Callaghan, said:
"Ryanair welcomes the Competition Commission's comprehensive report into the
market power of the BAA monopoly and fully endorses its findings. Competition
works - monopolies don't. BAA's monopoly control over the London airports has
been highly detrimental to competition and consumers. BAA has long ignored the
needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient,
gold plated facilities, encouraged by an ineffectual regulator, the CAA.
Stansted is now the most expensive, by a considerable margin, of Ryanair's over
150 airports around Europe. BAA's plans to waste a further GBP4bln. on a second
terminal and runway at Stansted, when such facilities could be built for a
fraction of that cost, is further evidence of their abusive monopoly and will
lead to even higher prices for consumers.
"The CC today confirmed its earlier findings that:
a) The BAA's monopoly ownership of Edinburgh and Glasgow airports has adversely
affected competition.
b) The BAA's monopoly ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports has
adversely affected competition.
c) The way BAA has conducted its business has adversely affected competition.
d) The inadequate regulatory regime operated by the CAA has adversely affected
competition.
"Monopolies clearly don't work and the BAA monopoly has done huge damage to
competition and the travelling public and it is high time it was broken up.
Competition in the airline industry has brought huge benefits to consumers and
this can be replicated at the main London airports.
"We are therefore calling on the UK Government to implement the Competition
Commission's recommendations as soon as possible and to break up the BAA
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WELCOMES CALL TO BREAK UP BAA MONOPOLY
monopoly in the interest of competition and consumers".

BRAVOFLY LTD DISCONTINUES SCREENSCRAPING RYANAIR.COM
RYANAIR TO CANCEL ALL SCREENSCRAPER BOOKINGS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 5th August 2008)
announced that BravoFly Ltd (an Irish screenscraping price comparison website)
has confirmed that it has discontinued screenscraping the Ryanair.com website as
part of legal proceedings filed against both it and its parent company BravoFly
SA. This is the second recent success Ryanair has scored against screenscraping
websites and follows Ryanair's successful injunction against V-tours to prevent
them from screenscraping Ryanair's website in Germany.
Ryanair has a policy of preventing screenscrapers unlawfully accessing Ryanair's
website, because in many cases these screenscrapers are engaged in some or all
of the following unlawful/inappropriate behaviour:
Ryanair Holdings PLC BRAVOFLY LTD DISCONTINUES SCREENSCRAPING RYANAIR
1. They are in breach of Ryanair's copyright rules.
2. They are in breach of Ryanair.com's terms of use.
3. They are levying unjustified and unnecessary handling charges (in some cases up
to double the Ryanair fare) on Ryanair passengers.
4. They don't provide passengers with Ryanair's accurate terms/conditions.
5. They don't provide passengers with up to date flight or change information.
6. They are delaying ordinary passengers' access to the Ryanair.com website.
Commenting on this latest success against screenscrapers, Ryanair's Howard
Millar said:
"We welcome this latest success against screenscrapers, as we continue our
campaign to eliminate this unlawful activity from the Ryanair website. Ryanair
is pursuing legal actions in a number of European countries to bring an end to
this unlawful and anti-consumer activity.
"Many of these screenscrapers do not provide consumers with any useful services,
because consumers know that they will get the lowest fares only on Ryanair.com,
thanks to Ryanair's lowest fare guarantee.However, in recent weeks genuine
passengers using Ryanair's website have been suffering long processing times and
slower access because of the huge volume of information being downloaded from
our website by these screenscrapers all over Europe. In all cases this scraping
activity is unlawful and in breach of both Ryanair.com's copyright and terms of
use.
"We are determined to eliminate these illegal practices, particularly in cases
where passengers are being misled by screenscrapers into paying higher fares,
unjustified handling fees and hotel and car hire charges that are higher than
they otherwise would be on Ryanair.com.
"Ryanair will next Monday (11th Aug) introduce new procedures to cancel all
passenger bookings made through screenscraping websites. We believe this is a
quicker and more effective way of discouraging this unlawful activity and we
hope that by getting rid of screenscrapers we will speed up passenger processing
times on Ryanair.com, as well as ensuring that Ryanair passengers are not paying
Ryanair Holdings PLC BRAVOFLY LTD DISCONTINUES SCREENSCRAPING RYANAIR
unnecessary handling charges or higher fares to screenscrapers. Ryanair is
continuing to work with our software providers, Navitaire and Microsoft to
proactively eliminate screenscraping of Ryanair's website. We hope this will
ensure that genuine consumers can purchase Europe's guaranteed lowest air fares
while enjoying rapid access and quicker processing times for their bookings on
Ryanair.com".

RYANAIR'S JULY TRAFFIC GROWS 19%
LOWEST FARES AIRTRAVEL GROWING RAPIDLY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airlines today (Tuesday, 5th August 2008)
announced that it carried almost 5.2 million passengers in July, a 19% (900,000
passenger) increase when compared to July 2007.
Ryanair is confident that traffic growth will remain strong as Ryanair continues
to offer passengers the guaranteed lowest airfares and no fuel surcharges this
winter. These strong growth figures prove that low fares travel is growing
rapidly as competitors raise their high fares and fuel surcharges.
Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said:
"Ryanair's latest passenger figures show that we are rapidly growing
passenger numbers this year. The most significant thing about today's figures is
that we carried over 15million passengers in the last three months. Passengers

are increasingly attracted to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and our promise
of no fuel surcharges ever".

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
exceptional items referred to below.
Exceptional items in the period ended June 30, 2008 amounted to EUR111.4m
consisting of the impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding of EUR93.6m and an
accelerated depreciation charge of EUR17.9m on aircraft to be disposed in
2009/10.
Adjusted profit excluding exceptional items decreased by 85% to EUR21.0m.
Including exceptional items the loss in the period amounted to EUR90.5m compared
to a profit of EUR138.9m in the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Summary Quarter ended June 30, 2008
Profit after tax decreased by 85% to EUR21.0m compared to EUR138.9 in the quarter
ended June 30, 2007 primarily due to a 93% increase in fuel costs. Total
operating revenues increased by 12% to EUR776.9m, slower than the 19% growth in
passenger volumes, as average fares decreased by 8%, due to the absence of
Easter and lower baggage penetration rates. Ancillary revenues grew by 25% to
EUR146.8m during the quarter. Total revenue per passenger as a result decreased
by 6%, whilst Load Factor decreased by 1% during the quarter to 81%.
Total operating expenses increased by 40% to EUR751.2m, primarily due to the
increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and increased costs,
associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, which represents 49% of total
operating costs compared to 35% in the quarter ended June 30, 2007, increased by
93% to EUR366.6m due to the increase in the price per gallon and an increase in
the number of hours flown, offset by a positive movement in the US dollar

exchange rate versus the euro. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 6%. Including
fuel they rose by 18%. Operating margins fell by 19 points to 3%
whilst operating profit decreased by 84% to EUR25.7m.
Net margins decreased to 3% from 20% at June 30, 2007 for the reasons outlined
above.
Earnings per share decreased to 1.40 cent for the quarter compared 8.98 cent in
the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Balance sheet
The Group's balance sheet reflects the cash generative strength of the business.
The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR194.5m and a further
EUR78.8m from the sale of Boeing 737-800 aircraft which part funded a EUR33.1m share
buy back programme and capital expenditure incurred during the period with the
remaining balance reflected in Total cash of EUR2,250.0m. Capital expenditure
amounted to EUR110.4m which largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for
future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of three aircraft. Long term debt,
net of repayments, decreased by EUR49.5m during the quarter.

15.   Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
 All revenues derive from the Group's principal activity and business segment as
 a low fares airline and includes scheduled services, car hire, internet income
 and related sales to third parties.
Revenue is analysed by geographical area (by country of origin) as follows:

 +-----------+---------+----------+
All of the Group's operating profit arises from low fares airline-related
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Q1 Results -8-
activities, its only business segment. The major revenue earning assets of the
Group are comprised of its aircraft fleet, which is registered in Ireland and
therefore principally all profits accrue in Ireland. Since the Group's aircraft
fleet is flexibly employed across its route network in Europe, there is no
suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical
segments.
16. Earnings per share
For the quarter ended June 30, 2008, there was no difference in the weighted
average number of ordinary shares used for basic and diluted net loss per
ordinary share, as the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares
outstanding was anti-dilutive.
17. Property, plant and equipment
Acquisitions and disposals
During the quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Group acquired assets with a cost of
EUR110.4 million (quarter ended June 30, 2007: EUR96.6 million).There were four
Boeing 737-800 aircraft disposed of during the quarter, the sale proceeds of
which amounted to EUR78.8m. Deposits have been received in relation to future
aircraft disposals.
18. Post balance sheet events
In July 2008, the Group acquired a further 3.5 million shares in Aer Lingus plc
at a cost of EUR4.2 million, bringing Ryanair's total holding in Aer Lingus to
29.8%.
19. US GAAP Reconciliation
Following on from the issuance by the SEC of Rule 3235 "Acceptance from Foreign
Private Issuers of Financial Statements prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards without reconciliation to US GAAP",
the Group has chosen to exclude a US GAAP Reconciliation from these interim
financial statements.

Adjusted profit after tax, decreased by 85% to EUR21.0m primarily due to a 93%
increase in fuel costs. Total operating revenues grew by 12% due to a 19%
increase in passenger numbers compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2007, an 8%
decrease in fares due to the absence of Easter, lower baggage penetration rates
and strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was offset
primarily by the increase in fuel prices which rose by 93% to EUR366.6m, increases
in route charges and airport costs. Operating margins, as a result, fell by 19
points to 3%, whilst operating profit decreased by 84% to EUR25.7m.
Total operating revenues increased by 12% to EUR776.9m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 19% to 15.0m. Total revenue per passenger decreased by 6% due to
the fall in average fares of 8%.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 9% to EUR630.1m reflecting a 19%
increase in traffic due to increased passenger numbers on existing routes and
the successful launch of new routes and bases, offset by an 8% decrease in
average fares due to the absence of Easter and lower baggage penetration
rates.Load factor decreased by 1% compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Q1 Results -6-
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
by 25% to EUR146.8m in the quarter. This performance reflects the growth in
onboard sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 40% to EUR751.2m primarily due to the 93%
increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and the increased costs
associated with the growth of the airline. Total operating expenses were also
adversely impacted by a 2% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 6% to EUR80.5m. Excluding the charge of EUR7.0m for a
one off share option grant in the quarter ended June 30, 2007 staff costs
increased by 11%. This primarily reflects a 33% increase in average employee
numbers to 6,280. Cabin crew, who earn lower than the average salary accounted
for the vast majority of the increase.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 36% to EUR47.2m. This reflects, net of
disposals, an additional 39 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this
quarter compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2007 offset by the positive
impact on amortisation of the stronger euro versus the US dollar.
Fuel costs rose by 93% to EUR366.6m due to the increase in fuel costs and a 22%
increase in the number of hours flown.
Maintenance costs increased by 13% to EUR14.3m primarily due to a combination of
the growth in the number of leased aircraft from 35 to 39 and the increased
level of activity, offset by the positive impact of a stronger euro versus US
dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 64% to EUR3.0m due to the tight
control on expenditure and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 5% to EUR19.1m as the number of leased aircraft
increased by 4 to 39 during the quarter.
Route charges rose by 17% to EUR74.2m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and a 2% increase in the average sector length.
Airport and handling charges increased by 12% to EUR113.8m due to the 19% increase
in passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Q1 Results -6-
and savings achieved on handling costs.
Other expenses increased by 8% to EUR32.7m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues, due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 19 points to 3% due to the reasons outlined
above and operating profits have decreased by 84% to EUR25.7m compared to
the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Interest receivable has increased by 13% to EUR22.7m for the quarter primarily due
to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period.
Interest payable increased by 31% to EUR30.0m due to the drawdown of debt to part
finance the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher interest
rates.
Foreign exchange gains during the quarter of EUR2.5m arose on the retranslation of
foreign currency deposits.
Exceptional items:
Accelerated depreciation of EUR17.9m arose on aircraft to be disposed in 2009/10.
Impairment charge: During the quarter the Group recognised an impairment charge
of EUR93.6m on its Aer Lingus shareholding reflecting the decline in the Aer
Lingus share price from EUR2.00 per share at March 31, 2008 to EUR1.40 per share at
June 30, 2008.
Balance sheet
The Group's balance sheet reflects the cash generative strength of the business.
The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR194.5m and a further
EUR78.8m from the sale of Boeing 737-800 aircraft which part funded a EUR33.1m share
buy back programme and capital expenditure incurred during the period with the
remaining balance reflected in Total cash of EUR2,250.0m. Capital expenditure
amounted to EUR110.4m which largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for
future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of three aircraft. Long term debt,
net of repayments, decreased by EUR49.5m during the quarter.
Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2008 decreased by EUR87.7m to EUR2,414.5m,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Q1 Results -6-
compared to March 30, 2008 due to the EUR90.2m decrease in profitability during
the quarter, offset by the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivative
financial assets, pensions, stock option grants and a share buy back. (See
details in note 14).

policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those
that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
In the year ended March 31, 2008 management reassessed its estimates of the
recoverable amount of aircraft residual values following certain recent and
forward aircraft disposals and aircraft pricing trends in the market.
6.   Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
 half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
7.    Income tax expense
The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
quarter ended June 30, 2008 was 0% due to the loss in the quarter.
8.    Capital and reserves
 Share buy back programme.
 Pursuant to the share buy-back programme announced in February 2008, from April
 1, 2008 to date, the Company has repurchased and cancelled 11.9 million shares
 at a total cost of EUR33 million. This is equivalent to 0.8% of the issued share
 capital of the Company at June 30, 2008.
9.    Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Q1 Results -7-
 statement in the period of approximately EUR0.7 million is related to the fair
 value of  various share options granted in prior periods, which are being
 recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services
 rendered.
10.   Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
11.   Capital commitments
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Group exercised three options under
 the 2005 contract with Boeing whereby it will increase its "firm" aircraft
 deliveries by this amount during the 2011 fiscal year.  This brings Ryanair's
 total firm orders for Boeing 737-800 aircraft to 135 and the total fleet size
 (net of planned disposals) to 265 by 2013.
12.   Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 In the quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Group recognised an impairment charge of
 EUR93.6 million on its shareholding in Aer Lingus reflecting a further decline in
 the Aer Lingus share price from EUR2.00 per share at March 31, 2008 to EUR1.40 at
 June 30, 2008.

RYANAIR WINS INJUNCTION AGAINST ENAC (ITALIAN CAA)
PREVENTS RYANAIR CIAMPINO FLIGHTS BEING DIVERTED TO FIUMICINO
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 22nd July 2008)
welcomed the decision by the Italian (TAR Lazio) Court last Friday to overturn
ENAC's latest Ordinanza, which forced Ryanair's Ciampino based aircraft to
divert late at night to Rome Fiumicino, thereby disrupting the travel plans of
thousands of Italian citizens and visitors. This is the third time since 2006
that the Italian Courts have overturned unlawful Ordinanza's created by ENAC to
disrupt the operations of Ryanair's Ciampino based aircraft.
Ryanair confirmed that since January, a total of 18 flights and over 2,700
passengers had been unlawfully diverted by ENAC on late evening flights and
prevented from landing as scheduled in Rome Ciampino, and instead diverted to
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WINS INJUNCTION AGAINST ENAC ( ITALIAN CAA)
Rome Fiumicino Airport. This meant late evening disruptions and long and
inconvenient bus journeys for Italian visitors and citizens back to
Rome Ciampino Airport to collect their cars, meet relatives etc.
None of these diversions would be necessary if ENAC (the Italian CAA) abided by
its own rules and regulations, which allow Ciampino based aircraft to land after
the midnight curfew at Rome Ciampino. The flights which are operated by the
quietest commercial aircraft in Europe, do not create any significant noise,
since they are landing flights only and do not result in a subsequent take off.
These diversions are causing untold inconvenience for Ryanair's Italian citizens
and visitors, because it means not only are the passengers on the diverted
flights inconvenienced and discommoded by ENAC, but also the passengers due to
depart from Ciampino on the early morning flight the following day typically
suffer delays of 3 to 4 hours while the aircraft positions back from Rome
Fiumicino to Rome Ciampino airport.
Ryanair believes that these unlawful Ordinanaza's by ENAC are part of ENAC's
continuing campaign to disrupt Ryanair's flights and operations in Ciampino as
part of further state subsistence being provided by ENAC to the Italian flag
carrier airline Alitalia.
Welcoming this latest injunction in the Italian Court's Ryanair's Michael
O'Leary said:
"For almost 10 years now Ryanair has been delivering significant choice,
competition and lower fares for Italian consumers and visitors, despite ENAC's
repeated unlawful attempts to limit and disrupt our operations at Ciampino
Airport. This is the third time in as many years that ENAC's conduct has been
found to be illegal and in breach of national and European regulations.
"We welcome the TAR Lazio Court's confirmation that Ryanair's aircraft can land
at Ciampino Airport after the curfew and we now call upon ENAC to put an end to
these unlawful and illegal diversions which are causing serious disruptions and
inconvenience to Ryanair's flights and Ryanair passengers.
"It is about time that ENAC, which has been one of the principal beneficiaries
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WINS INJUNCTION AGAINST ENAC ( ITALIAN CAA)
of Ryanair's growth in Italy in recent years, recognises the enormous benefits
that Ryanair delivers to the Italian economy generally and to Rome Ciampino in
particular. Ryanair calls on the Italian Government and particularly the
Minister for Transport to demand that ENAC stops these unlawful diversions to
Fiumicino Airport, and requires ENAC to observe existing Italian law which
allows these Ciampino based aircraft to land as our passengers expect, at
Ciampino Airport".

17 July 2008
RYANAIR ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OPERATIONS AT SEVEN BASES
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, today, Thursday, 17th July 2008,
announced the temporary closure of its operations at the following airports for
the period from Tuesday, 4th November until Friday, 19th December:
* Basel
* Budapest
* Krakow
* Palma
* Rzeszow
* Salzburg
* Valencia
Ryanair explained the decision to close its operations and cancel these flights
for the following reasons;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Temporary Base Closures
* Costs at these airports are amongst the most expensive in Europe and far
outweigh the potential revenue which passengers are prepared to pay,
particularly during the off peak winter period.
* With oil at $140 a barrel, flights at expensive airports must be reduced this
winter when fares are very low.
Ryanair confirmed that it had written to the airports seeking a reduction on the
costs of these flights this winter but their response was wholly inadequate. The
loss of this passenger traffic will now cost the airport authority significant
commercial revenue and
Announcing this closure, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said;
"We very much regret temporarily closing our operations at these airports during
this November and December period. However, a combination of high airport
charges and the massive increases which we face in fuel prices, makes it more
profitable for Ryanair to ground aircraft rather than fly them at these airports
during this period.
"These flights the passengers would not be lost to these cities or tourism if
they had responded adequately to Ryanair's proposals for cost reductions on
these flights for the winter season.
"Ryanair, with the lowest costs and lowest guaranteed fares in Europe, is the
only airline capable of retaining year round international tourism and business
links for such regional cities. However, low airport costs and local support are
required to sustain these operations, particularly through the low yielding
months in the winter. In the absence of this support, Ryanair has no alternative
but to cancel these routes and develop its business elsewhere.
"We will continue our discussions with the airport authorities in order to
convince them that this type of interruption to our services need not happen in
the future if costs are reduced and hopefully we can develop an agreement on how
they can support the year round continuation of our services on a viable basis
for the benefit of the airports and the regions they serve".
The lost passenger traffic and numbers of flights is outlined as follows:

17 July 2008
RYANAIR UNVEILS 14% CAPACITY REDUCTIONS AT
LONDON STANSTED THIS WINTER ('08/'09)
Ryanair, London Stansted Airport's largest airline today (Thursday 17th July,
2008) announced substantial capacity cutbacks at Stansted for its Winter
Schedule ('08/09). Ryanair, which last Winter had 36 aircraft based at Stansted,
will this Winter reduce that number to 28 aircraft (a 25% reduction), and an
approximate 14% reduction in the number of weekly flights from over 1,850 per
week last year to just under 1,600 this year. Ryanair estimates that its traffic
at London Stansted will decline this Winter by some 900,000 passengers compared
to last Winter's schedule.
Ryanair's decision to cut back capacity at Stansted is for the following
reasons:
1. London Stansted is the most expensive of Ryanair's 28 bases.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Unveils Capacity Reductions At Stansted
2. The BAA Airport monopoly has again increased airport charges by 15% this year,
on top of a 100% increase last year.
3. The total failure of the inadequate CAA regulatory regime to control these
unjustified cost increases or to persuade BAA Stansted to meet the needs of its
low fare airline users.
4. The fact that oil prices have risen to $140 a barrel.
Ryanair confirmed that it will lose less money this Winter by sitting these 8
aircraft on the ground, rather than flying them at an expensive airport like BAA
Stansted, during the Winter when fares are extremely low, but oil prices remain
stubbornly high. Ryanair confirmed that it had written to BAA Stansted in recent
weeks offering to operate these aircraft/flights this Winter in return for a
substantial discount on airport charges applicable to these flights for the
Winter season only. Like most monopolies, the BAA dismissed Ryanair's reasonable
requests out of hand. The BAA would rather impose high airport charges and have
fewer passengers, rather than working with airline customers to lower costs and
keep people flying during a Winter of crisis in the airline industry.
Announcing these cutbacks in London this morning, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary
said:
"These Winter Schedule cutbacks, which are significantly greater than those of
last Winter, show just how damaging the BAA Airport monopoly has become to
consumers and the best interests of London and UK tourism and the economy
generally. Like most monopolies, the BAA continues to increase costs at three
times the rate of inflation, while delivering miserable service and inadequate
facilities. Passengers continue to suffer long queues at security and passport
control and frequent baggage belt failures at Stansted because the BAA refuses
to staff or operate these facilities adequately.
"These cutbacks reaffirm the abject failure of Harry Bush and his inadequate
regulatory team in the CAA who have repeatedly failed to restrain the BAA's high
charges, price increases or to encourage them to meet the reasonable
requirements of Stansted users by developing the efficient facilities we need
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Unveils Capacity Reductions At Stansted
and are willing to pay for.
"When a regulated monopoly makes it more profitable for airlines to sit aircraft
on the ground rather than fly them through the winter, then obviously the CAA's
laughable regulatory regime has failed. The BAA Stansted's rejection of Ryanair
discount plan for this Winter proves yet again why the BAA monopoly should be
broken up and replaced with three competing London airports whose primary focus
will be on stimulating traffic and developing low cost efficient facilities,
which their customer airlines want and are willing to pay for.
"We hope that the Competition Commission report will in due course support
Ryanair's call for the break up of the high cost BAA monopoly, and replace the
inadequate and failed CAA regulatory regime with competing airports and better
still competing terminals at the main London airports. Monopoly airports and
the CAA's regulatory regime have delivered high prices and awful facilities. It
is time we allowed competition to deliver where monopolies have failed".
An example of these cutbacks is set out below:

RYANAIR ANNOUNCES FOUR NEW ROUTES AND INCREASED CAPACITY FROM STOCKHOLM
Increased capacity to Berlin, Eindhoven, Milan and Riga
New routes to Krakow, Lodz, Prague and Wroclaw
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 15th July)
announced four new routes from its Stockholm base to Krakow, Lodz, Prague and
Wroclaw. Ryanair also announced an increase in traffic to Berlin, Eindhoven
Milan and Riga. These new routes will start in October.
Announcing these four new routes, Dara Brady, Ryanair's Head of Advertising
said:
"Ryanair's low fares in Sweden have been a tremendous success because Swedish
passengers can't stand SAS's high fares and fuel surcharges. With these new
routes Ryanair will carry 2.5 million passengers annually to and from Stockholm
Skavsta for a small fraction of SAS's high fares, generating a visitor spend of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces New Routes & Increased Capacity
5 billion SEK in the region.
"Only Ryanair guarantees the lowest fares* from Sweden. If any passenger finds a
lower fare with another airline on the same route, Ryanair will refund double
the difference. To celebrate these new routes, we are giving 400 Sek discount on
all our return fares on all our flights. We urge all passengers to log onto
www.ryanair.com immediately, as seats this cheap will sell out fast."

RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 18% SCHEDULE REDUCTIONS AT DUBLIN FOR WINTER'08/'09
Tuesday, 15th July 2008: Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today
announced substantial capacity reductions at its Dublin base for the coming
winter schedule (08/09). Compared to winter 2007, when Ryanair operated 22
aircraft, and over 1,350 weekly flights, Ryanair's schedule at Dublin this
winter will be reduced to 18 based aircraft and less than 1,200 weekly flights.
This represents an 18% reduction in based aircraft, and an approximate 12%
reduction in weekly flights. Ryanair estimates that its traffic at
Dublin Airport this winter will decline by some 500,000 passengers compared to
last winter's schedule.
Ryanair's decision to cut back based aircraft numbers and flights at
Dublin Airport is for the following reasons:
* Dublin is the second most expensive of Ryanair's base airports.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Schedule Reductions At Dublin
* Costs at the DAA monopoly continue to increase at multiples of the present rate
of inflation.
* The Aviation Regulator continues to rubber stamp unjustified Dublin Airport cost
increases including a recent 50% increase in check-in desks and a new (double)
charge for check-in desks kiosks.
* With oil at $140 a barrel, flights at high cost/expensive airports like Dublin
must be reduced this winter when fares are very low.
Ryanair confirmed that it had written to Dublin Airport seeking a reduction in
the costs of these flights this winter, but this offer has been dismissed by the
DAA monopoly. This is a further example of the DAA monopoly's disregard for the
needs and requirements of its airline customers. Ryanair estimates that this
cutback in winter capacity will result in almost 500,000 fewer passengers using
Dublin Airport this winter. However by eliminating this traffic - which Dublin
Airport charges up to EUR15 per departing passenger (more than the total air fare
in many cases), Ryanair will minimise its losses at Dublin Airport this winter.
At a time when many other European airports are building low cost facilities and
reducing their charges, the Dublin Airport monopoly is wasting hundreds of
millions of euro on inefficient facilities, and the useless Aviation Regulator
is rubber-stamping most of the cost increases they seek. Last week's radar
system failures at Dublin Airport was just the latest indication that the
regulated Dublin Airport monopoly, and the regulated IAA monopoly are not
delivering what airport users want or need at Dublin Airport. The sooner
Ireland's useless Aviation Regulator is dismissed and replaced with competing
facilities, the better.
Speaking today on the Dublin schedule reductions planned for Winter '08/'09,
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
"We regret this significant capacity reduction at Dublin Airport this winter. It
will be the first time for many years that Ryanair has reduced capacity at
Dublin Airport. However, the combination of Dublin's high costs (second most
expensive base Ryanair operates to), unjustified cost increases (up 40% in the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Schedule Reductions At Dublin
last 4 years) and a hopeless Aviation Regulator who has most recently
rubberstamped doubling charging for check-in desks and check-in kiosks, makes it
more profitable for Ryanair to ground these aircraft rather than fly them at
Dublin Airport this Winter.
"These flights and 500,000 passengers would not be lost to Dublin or Irish
tourism if the DAA monopoly had responded to Ryanair's proposals for discounts
on these flights for the winter season. Like all monopolies the DAA has no
concern for its customers which is why Ryanair's offers were dismissed out of
hand.
"If a competing second terminal was being built at Dublin Airport, as Seamus
Brennan had proposed some years ago, airport charges at Dublin Airport would be
falling and facilities would be improving. Instead we have a Government-owned
airport monopoly wasting money building facilities that the airlines don't want,
and imposing massive cost increases at a time when fares are falling and oil
prices have doubled to all-time highs.
"I have little doubt that Ireland and its tourism industry is facing a
catastrophe over the coming year. Traffic growth at Dublin will be ended by this
combination of a rapacious Government monopoly, and an inadequate, useless
Aviation Regulator. The sooner both of these are done away with and replaced
with competing facilities at Dublin Airport, then the sooner Dublin can return
to traffic growth, lower costs and more efficient passenger friendly
facilities".

     "INADEQUATE" REGULATOR PROPOSES UP TO 150% PRICE INCREASE IN STANSTED
 RYANAIR CALLS FOR REGULATOR TO BE DISMISSED AND REPLACED WITH COMPETING LONDON
                                     AIRPORTS
Ryanair, the UK's largest passenger airline, today (Tuesday, 29th April 2008)
renewed its call for the dismissal of the CAA's Harry Bush, the regulator who
has this morning announced proposals for increases to passenger charges at
Stansted of between GBP4.00 and GBP7.00, or up to 150%. This follows a doubling of
these charges just last year. This more than doubling of already high passenger
charges demonstrates just how ineffective regulation is and Ryanair is calling
for the immediate breakup of the BAA airport monopoly in order to replace this
"inadequate" regulation with competition.
Ryanair has highlighted the lamentable recent record of the CAA in regulating
the Stansted Airport monopoly:
 1. Stansted's traffic is way ahead of their forecasts and their capital
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call for Regulators Dismissal
     expenditure is significantly behind forecast, yet passenger charges at
     Stansted have risen, not fallen.
2. CAA stood idly by in April 2007 when BAA Stansted doubled passenger charges.
 3. Despite the so called regulatory cap which limits BAA Stansted's income at
     7% of capex this year, thanks to better than expected passenger numbers, and
     the doubling of prices last April, BAA Stansted will recover approx. 14% of
     its capital or double that allowable under the cap.
 4. Instead of depreciating Stansted's assets each year, like most other
     companies do, CAA allows BAA to increase the value of these assets by
     inflation, thus double charging passengers.
 5. CAA failed to intervene over the past two years at Stansted when thousands
     of passengers were stuck in ridiculously long security and boarder control
     queues.
The UK Competition Commission's recent interim review on its investigation into
BAA's market power found that:
        a)     The BAA's monopoly ownership of Edinburgh and Glasgow airports
         has adversely affected competition;
        b)    The BAA's monopoly ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted
         airports has adversely affected competition;
        c)    The way the BAA monopoly has conducted its business has adversely
         affected competition; and
        d)    The inadequate regulatory regime operated by the CAA has adversely
         affected competition.
This regulator has clearly demonstrated that he has no interest in actually
protecting the reasonable interests of users but instead persists in his
"inadequate" and "light handed" approach to the BAA monopoly. Ryanair has
already announced that it will join easyJet's legal challenge of an equally limp
wristed approach by the regulator in Gatwick and will likely have to challenge
any decision by the CAA in Stansted.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Legal & Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan
said:
"Harry Bush has patently failed Stansted users and consumers in recent years.
The CAA's record includes:
 a) Doubling of passenger charges in 2007;
  b) Ignoring long security queues at Stansted;
  c) Doing nothing about even longer border control queues;
  d) Ignoring the unanimous opposition of users to BAA's plans to spend GBP4bln. on
     Stansted G2 when GBP1bln. would suffice; and
  e) This morning's recommendations to allow the BAA monopoly to further increase
     passenger charges by up to 150% means that passengers continue to suffer
     from Mr. Bush's incompetence.
The CAA has ignored volumes of evidence from Stansted airlines, the findings of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call for Regulators Dismissal
the OFT, DfT and now the CC, all pointing to the conclusion that BAA Stansted is
an abusive monopoly. Ryanair has long called for the break-up of the BAA
monopoly in London and for the three main airports to compete against each
other.
This latest failure by the regulator only makes this solution even more urgent.
Ryanair therefore renews its call for this failed regulator to be dismissed and
for the Competition Commission to recommend the immediate break-up of the BAA
monopoly so that the 3 London airports can be spun out into separate ownership
and competition can finally be introduced into the London airports market.
The BAA monopoly isn't working, CAA regulation is "inadequate" and it is time to
let competition deliver better services and lower prices for British passengers
and visitors."

                 BAGGAGE CHARGES RISE TO REDUCE CHECKED IN BAGS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Monday, 28th April 2008)
announced that it will continue its drive to increase the number of passengers
checking in on-line by increasing baggage and airport check-in charges from May
5. From this date Ryanair's checked in baggage fee will rise from EUR9 to EUR10
while airport check-in fees will increase from EUR4 to EUR5. Ryanair encourages
passengers to avoid these charges altogether by travelling with our 10kg hand
luggage allowance and checking in on-line.
Passengers who book their flights in the next week (before May 5) will avoid
these charges.
Announcing these charge increases, Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said:
"40% of Ryanair passengers currently avoid queues at both check-in and boarding
by availing of our free web check-in service, and this increase in baggage fees
Ryanair Holdings PLC Baggage Charges
will result in fewer checked in bags and more passengers changing to on-line
check-in.
"On-line check-in is faster, more efficient and costs Ryanair less. There is no
doubt that it is the future for air travel. We will continue to increase baggage
fees until half of our passengers check-in online, which will allow us to reduce
check-in and handling costs and pass on these savings to our passengers in the
form of Europe's guaranteed lowest fares.
"Ryanair will continue to drive down the cost of travel by reducing its average
fare (which includes baggage and check-in revenues) in 2008 and guaranteeing the
lowest fares on every route".

                BAA INTERFERES IN COMPETITION COMMISSION INQUIRY
                       TIME TO BREAK UP THE BAA MONOPOLY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Monday, 28th April 2008)
responded to news that the BAA monopoly was caught trying to influence the
Competition Commission's inquiry into the BAA's expansion plans at Stansted
Airport. The Competition Commission confirmed to the Sunday Times and the
Financial Times that the BAA had attempted to interfere in its appointment
process to engage a consultant to report on the airport monopoly.
Ryanair has complained for years that the BAA monopoly is guilty of playing the
regulatory system in order to increase charges at its monopoly airports so it
comes as no surprise that the BAA has interfered in the Competition Commission's
inquiry into its airport monopoly.
At Stansted airport for example, users are unanimously opposed to the BAA
Ryanair Holdings PLC Time to break up the BAA
monopoly's GBP4bn proposed expenditure on a second terminal and runway when it
could and should be built for less than one quarter the price. The BAA Monopoly
is simply gold plating this facility so that it can double airport charges.
Instead of protecting the interests of airport users as it is legally obliged to
do, the CAA regulator is simply rubber stamping the BAA's waste and monopoly
price hikes.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said:
        "The news that the BAA monopoly was caught interfering in the
         Competition Commission's inquiry comes as no surprise to Ryanair. The
         BAA has a long history of abusing its monopoly position and has for
         years successfully exploited its historical relationship with the CAA,
         which is supposed to regulate this airport monopoly. The result for
         passengers who pay exorbitant prices while stuck in queues, using
         facilities that arrive years late and don't work has been disastrous.
        "Ryanair welcomes the Competition Commission's inquiry into the BAA
         monopoly and again calls on the Government to break it up to allow
         competition to work where the BAA monopoly and regulation by the CAA
         have clearly failed".

               ALITALIA RECEIVES ANOTHER EUR300M UNLAWFUL STATE AID
                   RYANAIR SUBMITS STATE AID COMPLAINT TO EU
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 24th April 2008)
called on the European Commission to stop a further EUR300m unlawful state aid for
Alitalia. Alitalia has already received over EUR5bn in unlawful state aid, but the
European Commission, as always in the case of flag carriers, turns a blind eye
and does nothing. Without such illegal state aid, Alitalia which loses almost
EUR1m a day would have gone bankrupt years ago.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan
said:
        "Alitalia's latest EUR300m bailout makes a mockery of EU State Aid rules.
         Propping up an inefficient national airline, which would have gone
         bankrupt long ago is simply illegal. Continued unlawful subsidies are
         allowing Alitalia to ignore its debts and rack up losses with abandon.
        "The European Commission's repeated failure to enforce its own State Aid
         rules in the case of Alitalia provides more evidence that it applies one
Ryanair Holdings PLC STATE AID COMPLAINT TO EU
         set of rules for rule breaking flag carrier airlines but another
         discriminatory set of rules for Ryanair. The Commission has still failed
         to take any action on Ryanair's 3 year old state aid complaints about
         Alitalia, Air France, Lufthansa, Olympic and Volare, however it is
         pursuing 7 baseless investigations about Ryanair's open pro competitive
         deals at tiny regional European airports.
        "We are again today, calling on the Commission to stop ignoring this
         state aid scandal and to start applying its own state aid and
         competition rules fairly".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
22 April 2008
                 RYANAIR WELCOMES COMPETITION COMMISSION REPORT
            BAA'S AIRPORT MONOPOLY AND INADEQUATE REGULATORY SYSTEM
                     ARE BAD FOR COMPETITION AND CONSUMERS
Ryanair, Britain's largest passenger airline today (Tuesday, 22nd April 2008)
welcomed the Competition Commission's Report on its emerging thinking into the
BAA airport monopoly, and renewed its call on the UK Government to break up the
BAA monopoly which has been bad for consumers, bad for passengers and is
damaging UK tourism. Ryanair believes that the three London airports should be
spun out into separate ownership and encouraged to compete against each other. A
similar solution would improve competition, services and passenger charges at
Glasgow and Edinburgh airports also.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair welcomes the Competition Commission's report into its emerging
         thinking. We fully support the Competition Commission's view that:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcomes Competition Report
 a. The BAA's monopoly ownership of Edinburgh and Glasgow airports has adversely
     affected competition.
  b. The BAA's monopoly ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports has
     adversely affected competition.
  c. The way the BAA monopoly has conducted its business has adversely affected
     competition.
  d. The inadequate regulatory regime operated by the CAA has adversely affected
     competition.
        "The recent chaos at Heathrow's Terminal 5, the continuing long passport
         and security queues at Stansted, and the 47% price increases at Gatwick
         Airport clearly proves that the BAA monopoly over the London airports is
         bad for consumers, bad for passengers and bad for UK tourism. The CAA's
         recent decision to reward the BAA's incompetence with double digit price
         increases proves again that the CAA is incapable of regulating the BAA
         monopoly in the interests of users.
        "Monopolies don't work. Competition does. Ryanair had long called for
         the break up of the BAA monopoly, because we believe that competition
         between the three London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) would
         lead to faster delivery of additional capacity at each of these
         airports, would lead to real competition between the airports and this
         competition will result in better facilities, improved passenger service
         (and let's face it passenger service at the London airports couldn't be
         any worse) and lower costs for UK consumers and visitors.
        "The BAA airport monopoly has failed. The CAA regulatory regime has
         failed. The Competition Commission has correctly identified this failure
         and we again call on the UK Government to break up this failed airport
         monopoly and allow competition to put the interests of British consumers
         /users first. Competition works, monopolies don't".

                       Ruling on interim measures request
Dublin & London, 18 March 2008: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or "The Group
") announces that the President of the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg has
today declined Aer Lingus' request for an interim order restricting Ryanair from
interfering in the running of Aer Lingus' business.
The interim order was sought in the context of proceedings which challenge the
European Commission's decision that the Merger Regulation does not give it the
legal authority to force the sale of Ryanair's stake following its prohibition
of Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus. Today's decision only dealt with the request
for an interim order and Aer Lingus' appeal against the Commission's decision
still remains to be determined by the Court.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Ruling on interim measures
Aer Lingus received the lengthy order a short time ago and is reviewing its
contents.

EUROPEAN COURT HEARS RYANAIR'S APPEAL AGAINST COMMISSION'S CHARLEROI DECISION
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (Wednesday, 12th March 2008)
confirmed that the European Court of First Instance (CFI) had heard its appeal
against the EU Commission's anti competitive decision in the Charleroi case in
2004. The Commission ignored 30 years of Market Economy Investor Principal
precedent cases and changed its own (MEIP) rules in the Charleroi case in order
to find against Ryanair. The Commission failed to apply the accepted MEIP test,
which obliges it to allow state owned companies to compete on a level playing
field with similar privately owned companies.
The Commission ignored all of the evidence provided by Ryanair and industry
experts like Infratil and TBI, which proved that the agreement between Ryanair
and Charleroi Airport was the result of a competitive tender and did not involve
state aid.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Court Hears Charleroi Appeal
Commenting today following the hearing at the CFI, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory
Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
"Ryanair is happy to have finally forced the European Commission into court. We
are confident that the CFI will overturn what is a patently wrong and
anti-competitive decision. The case evidence clearly shows that the Commission
went to extreme lengths to invent a finding of state aid in this case and to use
it as a precedent to regulate all publicly owned airports.
At the hearing in Luxembourg, Ryanair raised the following grounds:
   The Commission failed to apply the Market Economy Investor Principle
     (MEIP), which is the test for proving that a public company was acting in
     the same way as a private investor would have in the same circumstances.
   The Commission ignored evidence that the Charleroi agreement resulted
     from Ryanair's negotiations with several other lower cost airports.
   The Commission ignored the fact that Ryanair's cost base at Charleroi was
     specifically offered to other airlines willing to make the same investment
     in the airport that Ryanair did.
   The Commission ignored the fact that Ryanair demonstrated that it had
     lower costs at several other privately owned airports.
   The Commission ignored the huge growth in traffic, profits and value of
     Charleroi airport as a result of Ryanair's investment in the airport
     (roughly EUR200 million).
   The Commission ignored the fact that other airlines, commercial retailers
     and airport investors have come to Brussels Charleroi Airport as a result of
     the successful partnership between Ryanair and the airport.
The Commission's decision was therefore seriously wrong and legally untenable.
We look forward to a positive decision of the CFI and are confident that the
successful partnership between low fares airlines and regional airports will be
vindicated and the anti competitive actions of the European commission
overturned".

                  RYANAIR CALLS ON AER LINGUS TO REDUCE FARES
                         AND GET RID OF FUEL SURCHARGES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 12th March 2008)
welcomed Aer Lingus' confession that it charges passengers twice as much as
Ryanair to travel in Europe.
Aer Lingus today admitted that its EUR91 European short haul fare rose 3% in the
last 12 months to EUR94. That means Aer Lingus' average fare is now more than
DOUBLE Ryanair's EUR44 average fare
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said:
        "While Ryanair continues to drive down fares for European passengers,
         Aer Lingus is increasing its fares and fuel surcharges. On routes within
         Europe, Aer Lingus now charges twice as much as Ryanair.
        "Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus guaranteed 10% fare reductions as well as
         the removal of Aer Lingus' unjustified fuel surcharges, generating
         passenger savings of over EUR100m p.a. However since the European
         Commission's nakedly political prohibition of Ryanair's bid, Aer Lingus
         has increased its fares and further raised fuel surcharges.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call on AL to Reduce Fares
        "Aer Lingus can't match Ryanair's prices and it can't match Ryanair's
         punctuality either. Aer Lingus has clearly returned to doing what it
         knows best, raising the cost of travel for Irish consumers".

                RYANAIR RESPONDS TO FURTHER EVIDENCE OF EU BIAS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th March 2008)
responded to further evidence of the European Commission's bias in applying one
set of rules for high fare flag carriers and another set of discriminatory rules
for Ryanair.
The European Commission announced today that it will investigate Ryanair's open,
pro competitive deal at Bratislava Airport. The Commission's investigation is
based on a spurious complaint by "a competitor", likely either Austrian Airlines
or Vienna Airport in order to block competition from Ryanair and Bratislava
airport. The investigation is completely baseless and coming on the eve of
Ryanair's appeal of the Commission's unlawful Charleroi Decision in the European
Court of First Instance is a pathetic attempt to put pressure on the Court.
The European Commission's unlawful Charleroi decision has already been used by
Ryanair Holdings PLC Evidence of EU Bias
high fares airlines and high cost airports to launch spurious complaints against
small regional airports such as Tampere, Aarhus, Alghero, Lubeck, Pau and now
Bratislava, despite the fact that the complaining high fare airlines have no
intention of ever flying to these regional airports. They simply want to block
the growth of these regional airports, block low fares, competition and choice.
Ryanair is appealing the Commission's flawed and unlawful Charleroi ruling in
the European Court of First Instance tomorrow and is confident it will be
overturned.
While the Commission responds rapidly to these baseless complaints from
Competitor airlines/ airports, it is doing nothing at all to investigate and
address the serious multi billion euro state aid subsidies to flag carrier
airlines (Air France, Alitalia, Lufthansa and Olympic). The European
Commission's lack of action over these serious state aid cases, has now forced
Ryanair to take separate cases against the Commission in the European Court of
First Instance, to compel the Commission to apply its own state aid rules fairly
and without discrimination against Ryanair.

Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said:
        "This baseless and spurious investigation in Bratislava is just the
         latest example of the EU applying one set of rules for flag carrier
         airlines and another discriminatory set of rules for Ryanair and is a
         pathetic attempt by the European Commission to put pressure on the
         European Court of First Instance on the eve of the Charleroi appeal
         hearing.
        "We are confident that the CFI will overturn the Commission's patently
         flawed, anti competitive Charleroi decision and call on the Commission
         to stop ignoring or signing off on continuing unlawful State aid for the
         inefficient high fare flag carrier airlines while pursuing baseless
         complaints by flag carriers against low fares airlines operating out of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Evidence of EU Bias
         regional and secondary airports.
        "This discriminatory twin track approach must end. It is time for the
         Commission to start promoting competition and consumer choice, and end
         unlawful State aid to flag carrier airlines".

                   LUFTHANSA INCREASES FUEL SURCHARGES BY 21%
             EUROPE'S FUEL SURCHARGING AIRLINES SET TO FOLLOW SUIT
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th March 2008)
predicted that Europe's high fare airlines will begin another round of
unjustified fuel surcharge increases following Lufthansa's decision yesterday to
increase its short haul fuel surcharges by 21%. Lufthansa now charges passengers
EUR17 per short haul flight and EUR77 on long haul flights despite the fact it is
hedged at well below current market rates for oil. Ryanair is the only airline
in Europe to guarantee passengers no fuel surcharges ever.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said,
"Passengers can expect another raft of unjustified fuel surcharge increases from
Air France, Alitalia, British Airways and Iberia in the coming weeks. All of
these airlines are hedged at well below current market rates for oil but all of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Lufthansa Surcharge Increase
them charge unjustified fuel levies and will use every possible opportunity to
increase their surcharges. Lufthansa increased its fuel surcharges by another
21% yesterday and it will not be long before Europe's other fuel surcharging
high fare airlines follow suit.
"The only way for passengers to avoid this fuel surcharge scam is to fly
Ryanair, Europe's only airline to guarantee no fuel surcharges ever".

Body
These Resolutions provided for the issue and subsequent purchase of 'A'
ordinary shares by the Company, or for the receipt of a special dividend.
OUTLOOK
The Board is confident that the Group will continue to progress this year and
into the future.
Underwriting
Price reductions have been a continuous feature of the Irish Insurance market
for the past five years, arising from reforms in the claims environment and
competition. These have resulted in Irish combined ratios converging to
European norms. In the knowledge of this inevitability, we have been pursuing
plans focused on broadening and strengthening our platform for medium and long
term growth, whilst maximising short term opportunities. These plans require
ongoing investment in human and capital resources and leave us well positioned
for the future. While such investment, by its nature, is not designed to
deliver significant, immediate returns, positive outcomes are already evident.
In recent weeks we launched a new stand-alone car insurance brand aimed at the
FBD Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
budget market, a market which FBD's premium brand is not designed for. This new
product, "No Nonsense Car Insurance", is an internet-only offering. It is being
marketed in conjunction with Ryanair Money, targeting car owners who wish to
comply with basic legal insurance requirements only, with limited add-ons
available at additional per item costs, should the purchaser so wish.
Our Business Support Centre, which commenced operations in February 2007 and
now has a complement of 150 staff, is providing additional sales capacity and
service support for personal lines business. Branch office staff now have
additional time available to pursue commercial insurance and related business
opportunities.
Significant new e-commerce developments and other initiatives to extend our
customer reach and engagement are well advanced and we are confident that they
will enhance our sales potential and our customer service levels.
Price reductions have continued in the market in the current year. The
sustainability of such pricing is questionable, given the cost/income ratios
that insurers are reporting. It is the widespread view of industry analysts,
however, that the downward trend is about to be reversed. In January of this
year, we implemented single-digit price increases on specific products where
ratios warranted rate changes. While this action has impacted policy growth, we
do not regard increasing our customer numbers at uneconomic premium levels as a
viable option. Gross premiums written are in line with the 2007 corresponding
period.
Non-Underwriting:
The particular challenges which our leisure, property and financial services
businesses faced in 2007 have continued in 2008.
On the property/leisure front, oversupply of product in the marketplace is the
key challenge facing our businesses, both in Ireland and in Spain. Management
are focusing on new marketing/sales initiatives and operational cost
efficiencies in meeting targets.
As regards the La Cala Tranche II land sale agreement, we advised in our
FBD Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
pre-close trading statement in December 2007 that, in addition to awaiting the
outcome of the Andalucian Regional Planning process, which has been delayed by
issues not associated with La Cala, our planning advisors were undertaking an
additional parallel approach at local/municipal level aimed at finalising
planning on the land. We reiterate their advices that, whilst delivery of the
planning ultimately remains outside their control, they believe this will be
obtained within the sale agreement deadline of June 2009.
In financial services, management are targeting to build on the successes
achieved in 2007 in developing new market segments to overcome lower commercial
premium levels (FBD Brokers) and the difficult investment climate (FBD Life).
Capital:
In June 2007, the Group returned EUR176m, i.e. EUR5 per share, of surplus capital to
shareholders. In addition, the Group undertook share buybacks amounting to
EUR52.6m. The 2007 payouts bring the total for capital repatriations to
shareholders since March 2005 to EUR496m. As previously stated, it is the Board's
intention to distribute the after tax earnings of EUR94.2m specifically
attributable to the claims reserves releases as soon as practical after AGM
approval has been obtained. This decision further illustrates the Board's
ongoing commitment to efficient capital management. It also reaffirms that the
utilisation of capital generated by the Group will be determined in the light of
the capital needs associated with the Group's development plans and consistent
with maximising returns to shareholders.
Footnote A
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating earnings per share, adjusted net
claims incurred charge and adjusted net operating ratios are arrived at by
adjusting for the impact of the change in the Group's reserving policy.
Footnote B
Management will present these results to analysts at 9.30 a.m today. A copy of
the presentation will be posted on the Group's website, www.fbd.ie at that time.

AVIATION REGULATOR PRESIDES OVER ANOTHER 50% PRICE INCREASE AT DUBLIN AIRPORT
Ryanair today (Friday, 29th February 2008) published its submission to the
Aviation Regulator on the latest unjustified cost increases being sought by the
Dublin Airport monopoly, which include another 50% increase for check-in desk
rentals and a new double charge for the floor space for self service kiosks in
the terminal, despite the fact that the airlines have already paid for this
terminal space through inflated airport charges.
The Aviation Regulator posted a notice on his website inviting submissions from
airline users. However, the Regulator has refused to publish DAA's
justifications for these price increases on the grounds that they were
"confidential and commercially sensitive". Airport users were denied the
opportunity to comment on these DAA submissions, because we haven't seen them.
The DAA monopoly refused to provide them to users on the grounds that they had
Ryanair Holdings PLC Regulator Price Increase
been "sent directly to the Aviation Regulator", and the Regulator now refuses to
publish them because he claims they are "confidential".
Ryanair objects to this conspiracy between the Aviation Regulator and the Dublin
Airport monopoly. If the DAA monopoly is seeking a 50% increase in check-in desk
charges - more than ten times the rate of inflation - then airport users should
be given the details of the alleged costs on which this enormous price increase
is based. The Regulator, is again in breach of his statutory obligation to meet
the requirements of users by failing to publish this information for them.
The DAA's latest request for a 50% increase in check-in desk charges comes just
three years after the Regulator previously rubber stamped a doubling of these
charges. There is no justification for a 150% increase in Dublin Airport
check-in desk rentals during a three year period when cumulative inflation was
less than 10%. There is no justification for any rental charge for the
installation of check-in kiosks on the floor of Terminal 1, which has already
been fully paid for by the airlines through high and ever rising airport
charges. This is a case of the airlines and passengers at Dublin Airport being
double and treble charged by an out of control DAA airport monopoly who is
conspiring with an incompetent Aviation Regulator.
Speaking today Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said:
        "The principal duty of this Regulator is to protect the reasonable
         requirements of Airport users. In the case of this latest inflation
         busting increase in check-in desk rentals, the Regulator has refused to
         provide users with the reasons for these cost increases and he is
         conspiring with the DAA monopoly to deny airport users any opportunity
         to comment on these cost increases.
        "Already over the past year short term car parking charges at Dublin
         Airport have been increased by 50%, ten times the rate of inflation. Now
         the DAA monopoly are looking for another 50% increase in check-in desk
         charges, again ten times the rate of inflation. The fact that the DAA
         are now looking to charge a floor space rental for self service kiosks
         despite the fact that this floor space has already been paid for in full
         by the airlines through high airport charges, confirms yet again that
         this Regulator has failed his statutory duty to protect the reasonable
         interests of users.
        "This useless Regulator continues to preside over a series of massive
         unjustified cost increases at Dublin Airport. He has failed on every
         occasion to meet the reasonable requirements of users. We believe it is
         high time that the Minister dismissed this incompetent Regulator and
         replace him with someone who is willing and able to challenge the DAA
         monopoly, and who is willing to defend the reasonable interests of
         airport users".

Announcing this new Edinburgh base, Ryanair's Director of Scheduled Revenue,
Sean Coyle said:
        "Edinburgh Airport has competed successfully against airports across
         Europe for Ryanair's 27th base. Our 19 routes will deliver significant
         economic benefits for Edinburgh by capitalising on Scotland's huge
         tourism potential and making it cheaper and easier than ever before to
         get here.
        "Ryanair already connects Scotland to more international destinations
         than any other airline and we look forward to delivering savings of over
         GBP20m for Edinburgh's passengers compared to the high fares charged by
         Easyjet and BA.
        "To celebrate the launch of our new Edinburgh base, we are releasing
         seats on all of our new routes for GBP10 including taxes and charges,
         while our existing routes to Dublin and Shannon will be available for
         just 1p all in. We advise passengers to snap up these bargain flights
         today on www.ryanair.com, as this offer must end midnight Monday".

                       RYANAIR COMPLAINS TO EU COMMISSION
        AGAINST EUR400M STATE AID TO AMSTERDAM AIRPORT AND KLM / AIR FRANCE
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (Wednesday, 27th February 2008),
filed a complaint with the European Commission against State aid of over EUR400
million per annum to Schiphol Airport and to KLM / Air France. This State aid is
being granted by the Dutch Government in the form of an exemption of transfer
passengers from the so-called "ECO-TAX" on air travel.
Announcing this complaint, Ryanair's Jim Callaghan said:
        "The Dutch Government's so-called "ECO-TAX" on air travel is clearly a
         tax scam to fill a EUR350 million hole in Holland's annual budget.
         Additionally, the Dutch Government is exempting transfer passengers from
         this tax, which amounts to massive subsidy to Schiphol Airport and KLM /
         Air France. While Schiphol is effectively the only Dutch airport
         handling transfer passengers, KLM / Air France accounts for 95% of the
         transfer traffic at the airport. This tax exemption is almost
         exclusively benefiting Schiphol and the KLM / Air France monopoly. The
         Dutch Council of State in September 2007 confirmed that it should have
         been notified to the European Commission as State aid.
        "At a time when the Commission's biased application of the State aid
Ryanair Holdings PLC Complaint to EU Commission
         rules is increasingly more apparent, we have little hope that the
         Commission will actually investigate this matter. Ryanair has lodged
         complaints regarding massive illegal subsidies to Air France, Lufthansa,
         Alitalia and other flag carriers, yet the Commission has failed to take
         any action whatsoever in these cases (some of which are almost 3 years
         old). Instead the Commission is persecuting tiny regional airports like
         Alghero, Pau, Lubeck, Schonefeld, Aarhus and Tampere, for commercial
         deals with low fares airlines to grow their traffic and promote
         competition.
        "It is time the Commission got its priorities right and started
         promoting competition and consumer choice. We are calling on the
         Commission to stop ignoring blatant State aid to Air France, Alitalia,
         Olympic, Lufthansa, Volare and now KLM, and to finally take on national
         governments who continue to distort competition in Europe's air
         transport market with billions of euro of illegal, back door State aid
         to their flag carrier airlines. The Commission should require the Dutch
         Government to either scrap this tax or to apply it to all passengers,
         i.e., both point-to-point and transfer at Schiphol, and end this EUR400
         million subsidy to KLM / Air France".

26 February 2008
                    Ryanair Update on Web System Changeover
Ryanair, today (Tuesday, 26th February 2008) continued to make significant
progress on eliminating many of the software glitches involved in bedding down
its new 'New Skies' reservations system, which is the background booking engine
of www.ryanair.com. This process has given rise to some hours today when record
bookings of over 20,000 per hour were taken, but also some hours when the
internet access on www.ryanair.com was temporarily reduced resulting in less
than 5,000 bookings being made.
Ryanair and its software supplier are continuing to work intensively to
eliminate these bedding down issues, and we expect to continue to deliver
improved internet access and faster booking speeds this evening and tomorrow.
The principal difficulty the website is encountering is the enormous surge of
passengers a) who were unable to make bookings over the weekend and b) who are
Ryanair Holdings PLC Update on Web Site
keen to get one of Ryanair's 1 million x 1 penny (tax inclusive) seats, which
are available for travel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in April, May and June.
Ryanair apologises to any passengers who have suffered inconvenience in
attempting to access Ryanair.com over the last 24 hours, but wishes to assure
all passengers that once this cut-over process has been completed this week,
they can look forward to faster booking times, and Europe's guaranteed lowest
airfares on www.ryanair.com.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "We are continuing to make significant progress with the cut over to the
         New Skies system. However, we expect further bedding down problems over
         the next day or two and we ask all passengers to be patient with us, as
         we complete the largest ever software changeover undertaken by any
         airline, anywhere in the world."

                     RYANAIR.COM REOPENS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
                    EUROPE'S GUARANTEED LOWEST FARES RETURN
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today announced that its website
booking engine upgrade has been completed one day ahead of schedule, allowing
Ryanair.com to return to business, guaranteeing the lowest fares on 633 routes
across Europe.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communication, Peter Sherrard said:
        "Our new booking site, like our flights, has arrived under budget and
         ahead of schedule. Ryanair would like to thank its customers for their
         patience during this transition period and we look forward to slashing
         prices again with our lowest fares and no fuel surcharge guarantee.
        "Our new, improved booking engine will enable us to welcome millions of
         additional passengers as we double in size to 100m passengers per annum.
        "We expect to be dealing with some small bedding down issues over the
         next few days and we would ask passengers to please bear with us as we
         iron them out. On Tuesday, Ryanair will release 1 million seats for just
         1p inclusive of taxes and charges, proving the OFT and the media's much
         hyped demise of the 1p fare wrong. To get your hands on one of our
         million 1 p tax inclusive seats make sure to visit www.ryanair.com on
Ryanair Holdings PLC Website open ahead ofschedule
         Tuesday".
Editor's Note
Enhancements for customers on the new Ryanair.com include:
   The additional processing power of the new system improves the website
     speed for customers, especially during peak booking periods.
   The Flight Change facility is now available up to 4 hours prior to
     departure at discounted rates.
   The online check-in period has been extended to 5 days before travel and
     customers can now check-in for both outbound and return flights at the same
     time.
   The Online Check-in system has been simplified and is now available in 8
     languages.
   Priority Boarding, items of checked baggage, musical instrument and
     sports, equipment can be purchased online up to 4 hours prior to flight
     departure at discounted rates.
   Finding our lowest fares will now be easier with the Flexible Search
     function.
   Fares will display inclusive of taxes not just on the home page as is
     currently the case, but on the flight select page too.
   We have added a Manage My Booking section where customers can retrieve,
     review, change and add additional services to their booking at discounted
     rates.
   Improved website accessibility for vision impaired customers.

In just five years, Ryanair has smashed Iberia's high fare monopoly by
guaranteeing Spanish passengers the lowest fares and no fuel surcharges ever.
This has driven down the cost of travel and delivered an annual EUR2bn tourism
spend in the Spanish regions.
Ryanair's new base in Reus Barcelona will replicate the success of our existing
bases in Alicante, Girona, Madrid and Valencia, transforming tourism to the
region and saving passengers EUR100m p.a. compared to Iberia's high fares and fuel
surcharges.
Announcing Ryanair's 26th European base in Reus, CEO Michael O'Leary said:
        "We congratulate Reus for fighting off stiff competition from seven
         other airports across Europe to win this new base which guarantees over
         1m passengers p.a and two new aircraft worth over $140m for 12 Ryanair
         routes.
        "Ryanair will now develop the region's massive untapped potential by
         giving the tourism industry year round low fare access to Europe's
         largest cities. The 1m passengers that Ryanair delivers to/from Reus
         next year will generate a local visitor spend of at least EUR150m.
        "All of Ryanair's routes from Reus are available until midnight Thursday
         for just EUR5 and we advise passengers to book early as demand will be
         very strong".
Ends.                             Tuesday, 12th February 2008

Hertz Completes Acquisition of BPA Franchise Locations in France
Hertz Continues Acquisition Strategy to Boost Worldwide Revenue Growth
PARK RIDGE, NJ--(Marketwire - February 11, 2008) - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.
(NYSE: HTZ) announced that its Hertz car rental brand has acquired six vehicle
rental locations from its licensee, BPA, in France. Located in the south of
France, BPA has operated a successful Hertz car and van rental franchise for
over 11 years. All employees from the six BPA locations will transfer to Hertz
France.
The acquired BPA business had estimated revenues of EUR 10 (US$14) million for
the year ended December 31st, 2007. Its territory covers an important and
dynamic leisure market in France, and includes the airports and downtown areas
of Carcassonne and Perpignan. Carcassonne has significant growth potential
through the presence of Ryanair and is close to Toulouse, a major corporate
Hertz Global Holding Completes Acquisition of BPA
city. Perpignan is located on the Mediterranean, close to the Spanish border and
is on the route of the French rail network (TGV), which brings strong leisure
business from Paris and the north of France.
Michel Taride, President, Hertz International, and Executive Vice President,
Hertz Corporation, said: "The acquisition from BPA is an important step in the
growth of Hertz France. The potential for growth of car and van rentals in the
south of France in future years remains substantial, especially as Carcassonne
airport has not yet reached its full passenger capacity. Carcassonne airport is
the largest destination in France of our partner Ryanair, with major traffic
from the UK. Perpignan is a major destination of Air France, another key airline
partner of Hertz."
The Hertz Corporation is the world's largest general use car rental brand,
operating from approximately 8,000 locations in 145 countries worldwide. Hertz
is the number one airport car rental brand in the U.S. and at 69 major airports
in Europe, operating both corporate and licensee locations in cities and
airports in North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand. In
addition, the Company has licensee locations in cities and airports in Africa,
Asia, and the Middle East. Product and service initiatives such as Hertz #1 Club
Gold(R), NeverLost(R) customized, onboard navigation systems, SIRIUS Satellite
Radio, and unique cars and SUVs offered through the company's Prestige, Fun and
Green Collections, set Hertz apart from the competition. Hertz also operates one
of the world's largest equipment rental businesses, Hertz Equipment Rental
Corporation, offering a diverse line of equipment, including tools and supplies,
as well as new and used equipment for sale, to customers ranging from major
industrial companies to local contractors and consumers through more than 360
branches in the United States, Canada, France and Spain.

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is
subject to important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially. It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the many
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -2-
factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an
airline operating in the European economy. Among the factors that are subject to
change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are the airline
pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers,
market prices for the replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental,
safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union ("EU")
and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in
currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general
economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general
willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political
factors.
Ryanair is Europe's largest low fares airline with 25 bases and 627 low fare
routes across 26 countries. By the end of March 2008 Ryanair will operate a
fleet of 163 Boeing 737-800 aircraft with firm orders for a further 99 new
aircraft (net of planned disposals), which will be delivered over the next 5
years. Ryanair currently employs a team of 5,000 people and expects to carry
circa 50.5 million scheduled passengers in the current fiscal year.

                  RYANAIR ANNOUNCES Q3 TRAFFIC GROWTH OF 21%,
               NET PROFITS FALL 27% TO EUR35M - IN LINE WITH GUIDANCE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Monday, 4th February 2008)
announced third quarter after tax profits of EUR35m, a 27% decline over the
comparable quarter last year, and in line with previous guidance. This profit
figure excludes a EUR12.1m profit from aircraft disposals. Traffic grew by 21% to
12.4m, yields fell by 4%, as revenues rose by 16% to EUR569m. The prior year Q3
comparable was distorted by a one off EUR10m contract termination penalty received
from a previous hotel partner. Excluding this one off prior year Q3 receipt
reveals an underlying profit decline of 10%. Unit costs were flat in the quarter
due primarily to a doubling of airport charges at Stansted, significant cost
increases at the Dublin Airport monopoly, combined with longer sector lengths,
offset in part by lower cost fuel hedges.

Note 1: Quarter ended 31 December 07 excludes a gain of EUR12.1m net of tax
arising from the disposal of 5 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
Announcing these results, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
"This net profit of EUR35m is a creditable performance in very adverse market
conditions. It reflects Ryanair's 21% traffic growth, a 4% decline in yields,
flat unit costs and a strong ancillary sales performance. Ancillary revenues
(excluding a one off EUR10m termination payment in the prior year) grew by 30% to
EUR111m. Ancillary penetration continues to increase, and we are on target to
achieve our ancillary sales objective of 20% of revenues over the next 3 years.
Inflight mobile phone services will be tested on 25 aircraft - subject to
regulatory approval - during the April-June quarter and we are optimistic that
passengers will quickly adopt this service to make/receive calls and texts on
their mobile phones and blackberries.
"Whilst unit costs were flat during the quarter, excluding our fuel hedges they
rose by 6% due to the unjustified doubling of airport charges at the Stansted
Airport monopoly, significantly higher charges at the even less competitive
Dublin Airport monopoly and 7% longer sectors. Costs were positively impacted by
our decision to reduce Winter capacity at Stansted by 7 aircraft, while staff
costs rose by 18% to EUR67m due to an increase in cabin crew ratios which will
continue through the remainder of this fiscal year.
"We welcome the UK Government's decision to reject the anti-consumer proposal by
the CAA Regulator to dedesignate the Stansted Airport monopoly. We continue to
campaign for the break up of the BAA Airport monopoly in London, and/or a more
effective regulatory regime than that operated by the inept CAA Regulator. The
CAA stood idly by last year while Stansted Airport doubled passenger charges and
at the same time delivered abject service to airlines and passengers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
The London airports and consumers need a much tougher regulator than the
misguided CAA which has repeatedly put the needs of the BAA Stansted airport
monopoly before the reasonable interests of passengers and airport users.
"At Dublin, a similarly protected (Government owned) monopoly continues to raise
prices by up to 50% at a time when most other European airports are reducing
them. The DAA are pushing ahead with their crazy EUR800m second terminal, the cost
of which has escalated to more than four times its original EUR200m budget.
Passenger charges at Dublin Airport are rising at many times the rate of
inflation, because the Irish Aviation Regulator (who is even more ineffectual
than the CAA in the UK) is asleep on the job. Ryanair has called for his
dismissal on grounds of incompetence. He can't even run his own office
efficiently or effectively, never mind regulate a powerful, abusive monopoly
like the DAA.
"Thankfully at most other airports, where competition exists, airport and
handling costs are falling. This is as it should be in an era of ever declining
air fares. Our new bases at Alicante and Valencia in Spain, Belfast City in
Northern Ireland, and Bristol in the UK have performed well during their first
Winter and we expect this trend to continue. We have recently announced two new
bases at Bournemouth and Birmingham in the UK, where we expect to invest
significantly in new aircraft, new routes and new jobs in Summer 2008, as we
roll out Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares to more regional UK cities. We
continue to have more new base opportunities than we can handle at present, and
expect to be in a position to announce at least two further European bases
shortly, both of which will launch in Winter 2008.
GUIDANCE FOR 07/08
"Looking forward to the end of the current fiscal year ('07/'08) we now have
sufficient visibility over Q4 bookings and yields to enable us to maintain our
previous guidance of net profit growth of 17.5% to approx. EUR470m for the full
fiscal year, (07/08). We expect the decline in average fares this Winter will be
close to 5% and within the range previously guided. Our ability to grow net
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
profits, in a year when most of our competitors are suffering declines or losing
money is testament to the continuing strength of Ryanair's guaranteed lowest
fare business model across Europe.
GUIDANCE FOR 08/09
"At this time it is too early to make any accurate forecasts in such volatile
markets for 2008/09. However with oil prices at $90 a barrel and fear of
recession in the UK and many other European economies, the current outlook for
the coming fiscal year is poor. We remain essentially unhedged for next year.
Current oil prices, which have risen by nearly 40% to $90 a barrel, will impose
significantly higher costs during a year when we are expanding capacity by
almost 20%. Costs will be hurt by a projected 5% increase in sector length. To
compound this negative outlook, European consumer confidence is waning which
would suggest that, unlike two years ago, (when higher yields compensated for
higher oil prices), next years yields may be flat or continue to fall, as
consumers become more price sensitive.
Our earnings may also be impacted by the recent weakness of Sterling which
accounts for a significant proportion of Ryanair's revenues.
"The European airline sector is presently facing one of these cyclical
downturns, with possibility of a "perfect storm" of higher oil prices, poor
consumer demand, weaker Sterling and higher costs at unchecked monopoly airports
such as Dublin and Stansted which account for a significant proportion of
Ryanair's traffic. While it is impossible to accurately forecast full year fuel
prices and yields this far in advance, there is now a significant chance that
profits may decline next year. At our most optimistic, a combination of flat
yields and $75 oil would see profits grow by 6% to approximately EUR500m, but at
our most conservative, if forward oil prices remain at $85, and consumer
sentiment/sterling weakness leads to a 5% reduction in yields, then profits in
the coming year could fall by as much as 50% to as low as EUR235m (excluding
profits from aircraft disposals). We would hope to be in a position to provide a
more informed update on guidance with the release of our full year results on
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
June 3rd, 2008.
"There can be only one competitive response to any consumer uncertainty, and
that is for Ryanair to slash fares and yields, stimulate traffic, encourage
price sensitive consumers, and promote new routes/base developments. The airline
business is highly cyclical and we have seen these downturns before. They pose
unique long term opportunities for the lowest cost producer - Ryanair - to grow
rapidly, open new markets, win share from competitors and speed up the pace of
industry consolidation which will lead to flag carriers withdrawing capacity
from certain markets and loss making competitors disappearing altogether.
"This process has already started in Europe. For example, Aer Lingus has already
withdrawn services on routes from Dublin to Seville, Newcastle, Poznan, and from
Shannon to London. We have also witnessed the withdrawal of British Airways from
Birmingham following the sale of its "Connect" subsidiary to Flybe and the
subsequent closure of 9 routes. Capacity has also been withdrawn by weaker so
called low fare carriers across Europe. Many of these carriers have cancelled
their growth plans, while others are in significant retrenchment. High fuel
costs combined with rising losses mean that some of these carriers will not
survive should this potential "perfect" storm materialise.
"Ryanair has the lowest cost base in the European industry and even in a
recession will continue to be substantially profitable. Despite the possibility
of a fall in profits next year, our airline continues to deliver the industry's
highest margins and will remain enormously cash generative, with a very strong
balance sheet. We continue to have over EUR2bn in cash despite spending over EUR700m
in the last twelve months acquiring a 29% stake in Aer Lingus and completing a
share buyback of EUR300m.
EUR200M SHARE BUY BACK
At our AGM in September 2007, shareholders authorised that directors could
re-purchase ordinary shares ("buyback") amounting to 5% of the company's issued
share capital. The directors have decided, in the best interests of the company
and its shareholders as a whole, to undertake a second buyback programme of up
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
to EUR200m. At the current market price of EUR3.60 this equates to a buyback of

Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
exceptional items referred to below.
Exceptional items in the nine months ended December 31, 2007 amounted to EUR12.1m
(net of tax) which arose from the sale of 5 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
Profit after tax increased by 21% compared to the previous nine months ended
December 31, 2007 to EUR454.8m, whilst adjusted profit after tax increased by 17%
to EUR442.6m. During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, profit after tax
decreased by 1% to EUR47.2m whilst adjusted profit after tax decreased by 27% to
EUR35.0m.
Summary Nine Months ended December 31, 2007
Profit after tax increased by 17% to EUR442.6m, compared to EUR376.9m in the
comparative nine month period ended December 31, 2006 reflecting a 20% increase
in passenger numbers, a 2% decrease in fares (including checked in baggage
revenues) and strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was
offset by a combination of higher fuel, airport charges, and staff costs. Total
operating revenues increased by 21% to EUR2,123.7m, which was faster than the 20%
growth in passenger volumes, as average fares decreased by 2% and ancillary
revenues grew by 40% to EUR363.1m. Total revenue per passenger as a result
increased by 1%, whilst Passenger Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 84% during
the period.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR1,618.1m, due to the increased
level of activity, and increased costs, associated with the growth of the
airline. Fuel, which represents 36% of total operating costs compared to 39%
last year, increased by 14% to EUR585.0m due to an increase in the number of hours
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -3-
flown, offset by a decrease in the US dollar cost per gallon, a positive
movement in the US dollar exchange rate versus the euro, and a reduction in fuel
consumption arising from the installation of winglets. Staff costs rose by 25%
reflecting the growth in the airline, a share option charge of EUR9.1m, and an
increase in cabin crewing ratios. Excluding the charge of EUR9.1m for the share
option grant, staff costs would have increased by 20%. Airport and Handling
charges increased by 48% to EUR302.9m arising from the doubling of airport charges
at Stansted and higher charges at Dublin Airport. Unit costs rose by 3% and
operating margins decreased by 1 point to 24%, whilst operating profit increased
by 14% to EUR505.6m.
Net Margins decreased by 1 point to 21% for the reasons outlined above.
Earnings per share increased by 23% to 29.94 cent for the period.
Balance Sheet
Total cash decreased by EUR147.0m to EUR2,051.0m as the growth in profitability was
offset by the funding of, a EUR300m share buy back programme, an additional EUR58.0m
investment in Aer Lingus and EUR578.4m in capital expenditure largely from
internal resources. Total debt, net of repayments, increased during the period
by EUR206.9m. Shareholders' Equity at December 31, 2007 increased by EUR41.0m to
EUR2,580.8m, compared to March 31, 2007 due to the EUR454.8m increase in
profitability during the period and by EUR8.4m due to the exercise of share
options, offset by, EUR122.1m due to the impact of the required IFRS accounting
treatment for derivative financial instruments, available for sale financial
assets, stock options and a share buy back of EUR300m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Nine Months Ended December 31, 2007
Adjusted Profit after tax, increased by 17% to EUR442.6m due to a 20% increase in
passenger numbers, a 2% decrease in fares (including checked in baggage
revenues) and strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was
offset by a combination of, increased airport costs which rose by 48% to EUR302.9m
(arising from the doubling of airport charges at Stansted and higher charges at
Dublin Airport) and increased staff costs primarily due to higher cabin crewing

ratios, which rose by 25% to EUR213.1m. Operating margins, as a result, decreased

Operating margins fell by 4 points to 8% due to the reasons outlined above and
operating profits have decreased by 23% to EUR44.2m during the quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by 44% to EUR21.4m for the quarter primarily due
to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period, offset somewhat
by a lower average cash balance.
Interest payable increased by 22% to EUR25.3m due to the drawdown of further debt
to part finance the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher
interest rates.
Foreign exchange losses during the period of EUR3.5m are primarily due to the
negative impact, on foreign currency deposits, of changes in the US dollar and
sterling exchange rate against the euro.
Gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment of EUR13.7m arose on the sale
of 5 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.

* the interim management report includes a fair review of the information
required by:
(a) Regulation 8(2) of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations

Notes
1. Reporting entity
Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The
condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the nine
months ended December 31, 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the "Group").
The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended
March 31, 2007 are available at www.ryanair.com
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
2. Statement of compliance
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
interim financial statements") have been prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standard No. 34 ("IAS 34") "Interim Financial
Reporting". They do not include all of the information required for full annual
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent
published consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2007 do not
constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
regulation 40 of the European Communities (companies, group accounts)
regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31,
2007 have been filed with the companies' office. The auditors' report on these
financial statements was unqualified.
The Audit Committee approved the interim financial statements for the nine
months ended December 31, 2007 on February 1, 2008.
3. Significant accounting policies
Except as stated otherwise below, this quarter's financial information has been
prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS").
4. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results (Operating and Financial
Overview) for the nine months ended December 31, 2007 and the comparative nine
months are based on the results reported under the Group's IFRS accounting
policies.
5. Estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
Except as described below, in preparing these consolidated financial statements,
the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting
policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those
that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
During the period ended December 31, 2007 management reassessed its estimates of
the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values following certain recent and
forward aircraft disposals and trends in the market.
6. Seasonality of operations
The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
7. Income tax expense
The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
nine months ended December 31, 2007 was approximately 11 percent, in line with
the same period last year.
8. Capital and reserves
Share buy back programme.
The Company commenced a share buy back programme in June 2007 and 59.5m shares,
at an approximate cost of EUR300m, have been purchased and cancelled. This
represents approximately 3.8% of the pre existing share capital of the Company.
9. Share based payments
The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
recent published consolidated financial statements. In June 2007 a further grant
on similar terms was made to eligible employees, with a consequent charge to the
income statement in the period of approximately EUR9.1m.
10. Contingencies
The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
business. The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
financial position.
11. Capital commitments
During the nine months ended December 31, 2007 the Group announced the purchase
of 27 additional Boeing 737-800s. This brings Ryanair's total firm orders for
B737-800s to 308 and the total fleet size (net of planned disposals) to 262 by
2012. These additional aircraft are due for delivery in financial year ending
March 31, 2010.
12. Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
The following table sets out the movement in available for sale financial assets
 in the nine month period.
                                                                          EUR'000
                                                                        -------
 Balance at April 1, 2007                                               406,075

 Net change in fair value                                              (138,587)
                                                                     ----------
 Balance at December 31, 2007                                           325,478
                                                                     ----------
As of December 31, 2007 the average cost per share of Aer Lingus was EUR2.52 and
the market value was EUR2.09, a decline of 17%. Accordingly the view at this time
under accounting rules is that this is neither "significant" nor "prolonged", in
particular because there has been a recovery in the share price post period end,
and therefore no impairment loss has been recorded.
However in the event that the asset becomes impaired the difference between the
cost of the shares and the market value is recorded as an impairment loss in the
profit and loss. At December 31, 2007 this amounted to EUR77.4m and on February 1,
2008 this had fallen to EUR41.6m. The Group will review this matter at the end of
each quarter.
13. Post balance sheet events
There were no significant post balance sheet events.
14. Loans and borrowings

16. Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
All revenues derive from the Group's principal activity and business segment as
a low fares airline and includes scheduled services, car hire, internet income
and related sales to third parties.
Revenue is analysed by geographical area (by country of origin) as follows:
                                                       Period             Period

All of the Group's operating profit arises from low fares airline-related
activities, its only business segment. The major revenue earning assets of the
Group are comprised of its aircraft fleet, which is registered in Ireland and
therefore principally all profits accrue in Ireland. Since the Group's aircraft
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
fleet is flexibly employed across its route network in Europe, there is no
suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical
segments.
17. Property, plant and equipment
Acquisitions and disposals
During the nine months ended December 31, 2007, the Group acquired assets with a
cost of EUR578.4m (nine months ended December 31, 2006: EUR195.2 million). There
were five Boeing 737-800 aircraft disposed of during the nine month period, the
sale proceeds of which amounted to EUR100.4m. Additional deposits have been
received in relation to forward sales.
18. US GAAP Reconciliation
Following on from the issuance by the SEC of rule 3235 "Acceptance from Foreign
Private Issuers of Financial Statements prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards without reconciliation to US GAAP",
the Group has chosen to exclude a US GAAP Reconciliation from these interim
financial statements.

by 1 point to 24%, which in turn resulted in operating profit increasing by 14%
to EUR505.6m compared to the previous nine months ended December 31, 2006.
Total operating revenues increased by 21% to EUR2,123.7m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 20% to 38.9m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 1% due to
strong ancillary revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 18% to EUR1,760.7m reflecting a 2%
decrease in fares and a 20% increase in traffic due to increased passenger
numbers on existing routes and the successful launch of new routes and bases.
Load factor decreased by 1 point to 84% during the period due to a 22% increase
in seat capacity.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
by 40% to EUR363.1m in the period. This performance reflects the strong growth in
onboard sales, excess baggage revenues, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other
ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 24% to EUR1,618.1m due to the increased level of
activity, and the increased costs associated with the growth of the airline
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
particularly higher airport charges and staff costs. Total operating expenses
were also adversely impacted by a 7% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 25% to EUR213.1m. This primarily reflects a 29%
increase in average employee numbers to 5,056, the impact of pay increases
granted during the period, and a EUR9.1m charge for a share option grant made to
eligible employees. Excluding the charge of EUR9.1m for the share option grant,
staff costs would have increased by 20%. Employee numbers rose due to the growth
of the business and an increase in cabin crewing ratios as a result of a new EU
working directive. Pilots, who earn higher than the average salary, accounted
for 24% of the increase in employees during the period.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 14% to EUR123.6m. This reflects, net of
disposals, an additional 25 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this period
compared to December 31, 2006, offset by a revision of the residual value of the
fleet to reflect current market valuations and the positive impact on
amortisation of the stronger euro versus the US dollar.
Fuel costs rose by 14% to EUR585.0m due to a 28% increase in the number of hours
flown offset by a 9% decrease in the euro equivalent cost per gallon of fuel
hedged in addition to a reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of
winglets.
Maintenance costs increased by 28% to EUR41.2m, due to a combination of the growth
in the number of leased aircraft from 30 to 35, the increased level of activity,
offset by the positive impact of a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 2% to EUR15.6m due to the tight
control on expenditure and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 35% to EUR55.1m as the weighted average number
of leased aircraft increased by 12 during the period compared to the same period
last year.
Route charges rose by 32% to EUR192.1m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and a 7% increase in the average sector length.
Airport and handling charges increased by 48% to EUR302.9m, significantly faster
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
than the growth in passenger volumes, and reflects the impact of the doubling of
unit costs at Stansted Airport and higher charges at Dublin Airport, offset by
lower costs at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 18% to EUR89.5m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 1 point to 24% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 14% to EUR505.6m during the
period.
Interest receivable has increased by 44% to EUR62.9m for the period primarily due
to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period, partially offset
by a lower average cash balance.
Interest payable increased by 13% to EUR70.2m due to the drawdown of debt to part
finance the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher interest
rates.
Foreign exchange losses during the period of EUR2.0m are primarily due to the
negative impact, on foreign currency deposits, of changes in the US dollar and
sterling exchange rate against the euro.
Gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment of EUR13.7m arose on the sale
of 5 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in
profits during the period. The Company generated cash from operating activities
of EUR441.5m and EUR132.6m from the sale of Boeing 737-800 aircraft which part
funded the EUR300m share buy back programme, EUR58.0m increased investment in Aer
Lingus, and capital expenditure incurred during the period with the remaining
balance reflected in Total Cash of EUR2,051.0m. Capital expenditure amounted to
EUR578.4m which largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future aircraft
deliveries the delivery of nineteen aircraft and two simulators. Long term debt,
net of repayments, increased by EUR206.9m during the period.
Shareholders' Equity at December 31, 2007 increased by EUR41.0m to EUR2,580.8m,
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
compared to March 31, 2007 due to the EUR454.8m increase in profitability during
the period, EUR8.4m arising from the exercise of share options, offset by EUR122.1m
reflecting the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivative financial
assets, available for sale financial assets, stock options and share buy back of
EUR300m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended December 31, 2007
Adjusted Profit after tax, decreased by 27% to EUR35.0m due to a 21% increase in
passenger numbers, offset by a 4% decrease in fares (including checked in
baggage revenues). Excluding the one off EUR10.0m contract termination penalty
receipt in the prior year comparative, profit after tax fell by 10%. The 16%
growth in Total Revenues was offset by a combination of increased airport costs
which rose by 43% to EUR94.0m arising from the doubling of airport charges at
Stansted and higher charges at Dublin Airport, and a one off step up in staff
costs, primarily due to higher cabin crewing ratios, which rose by 18% to
EUR66.8m. Operating margins, as a result, decreased by 4 points to 8%, which in
turn resulted in operating profit decreasing by 23% to EUR44.2m compared to the
comparative quarter ended December 31, 2006.
Total operating revenues increased by 16% to EUR569.4m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 21% to 12.4m. Total revenue per passenger decreased by 4% in line
with the decrease in average passenger fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 15% to EUR458.7m due to a 21% increase
in traffic reflecting increased passenger numbers on existing routes and the
successful launch of new routes and bases. During the period average fares
(including checked baggage revenues) were down by 4% whilst load factor remained
flat at 81% during the quarter.
Ancillary revenues increased by 16% to EUR110.7m in the quarter and excluding the
one off EUR10.0m contract termination penalty receipt in the prior year
comparative they rose by 29%. This performance reflects the strong growth in
excess baggage revenues, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary
products.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
Total operating expenses rose by 21% to EUR525.2m due to the increased level of
activity, and the increased costs associated with the growth of the airline
particularly higher airport charges and staff costs. Total operating expenses
were also adversely impacted by a 7% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 18% to EUR66.8m. This primarily reflects a 29%
increase in average employee numbers to 5,056 and the impact of pay increases
granted during the year. Employee numbers rose due to an increase in cabin
crewing ratios as a result of a new EU working directive. Pilots, who earn
higher than the average salary, accounted for 15% of the increase in employees
during the period.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 30% to EUR47.5m. This reflects, net of
disposals, an additional 25 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this
quarter compared to December 31, 2006, offset by a revision of the residual
value of the fleet to reflect current market valuations and the positive impact
on amortisation of the stronger euro versus the US dollar.
Fuel costs rose by 10% to EUR192.3m due to a 27% increase in the number of hours
flown offset by an 11% decrease in the average euro equivalent cost per gallon
of fuel hedged and a reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of
winglets.
Maintenance costs increased by 31% to EUR14.3m, due to a combination of the
increase in the number of leased aircraft from 30 to 35, an increase in the
level of activity, offset by the positive impact of stronger euro versus the US
dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased to EUR1.0m due to the tight control on
expenditure and increased focus on internet based promotions.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 19% to EUR18.3m reflecting an additional 5
leased aircraft operating during the quarter compared to the same quarter last
year.
Route charges rose by 32% to EUR63.2m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and a 7% increase in the average sector length.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
Airport and handling charges increased by 43% to EUR94.0m. This is higher than the
growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of the doubling of costs at
Stansted Airport and higher charges at Dublin Airport, offset by lower costs at
new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 19% to EUR27.7m, lower than the growth in ancillary
revenues excluding the one off EUR10.0m contract termination receipt in ancillary
revenues in the prior year comparative.

                        RYANAIR RESPONDS TO LEGAL ACTION
                   FROM PRESIDENT SARKOZY AND MS CARLA BRUNI
Ryanair, France's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 31 January 2008)
responded to a legal action launched by President Sarkozy and Ms Carla Bruni,
relating to a humorous advert, which ran in the Le Parisien newspaper last week.
Ryanair has previously written to President Sarkozy's office apologising for any
offence caused, and undertaking that it would not publish the advert (or
anything similar to it) again. Ryanair has also offered - as a token of its
regret - to make a donation of EUR5,000 to any charity of President Sarkozy's
choice.
Last evening however, Ryanair received legal papers from President Sarkozy and
Ms Bruni under which President Sarkozy was seeking damages of EUR1, but Ms Bruni
was seeking damages of EUR500,000. Ryanair's lawyers will today tell the French
Ryanair Holdings PLC SARKOZY LEGAL ACTION
Courts that they are happy to settle President Sarkozy's claim for EUR1 and
Ryanair will renew its offer to make a charitable contribution of EUR5,000 to any
charity of President Sarkozy's choice. Ryanair has the utmost respect for
President Sarkozy and the high office which he holds.
Ryanair's lawyers will also make a similar offer to Ms Bruni, offering damages
of EUR1 and a contribution of EUR5,000 to any charity of Mr Bruni's choice. Ryanair
will not however agree to any totally unjustified payment of EUR500,000 to Ms
Bruni, who has engaged in an open, widely publicised and internationally
reported relationship with President Sarkozy. The advert used by Ryanair was
taken from one of the French newspapers and Ryanair notes that Ms Bruni did not
make any objection to any of the remaining thousands of photographs of her which
have appeared in over 55,000 newspapers and magazines in recent weeks.
Speaking today Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said:
        "We apologised immediately and sincerely to both President Sarkozy and
         Ms Bruni for this advert which ran in Le Parisien newspaper this week.
         It was an honest attempt by Ryanair to reflect humorously and positively
         on this very public and publicised relationship.
        "However Ryanair has no intention of giving in to threats from Ms Bruni
         or to her ludicrous claims and we will vigorously oppose any claim for
         EUR500,000 from this lady who had engaged in one of the most open,
         publicised and internationally reported relationships, in the world, in
         recent weeks.
        "We do however renew our sincere apologies to both President Sarkozy and
         to Ms Bruni and believe that an appropriate payment to a charity of
         their choice would be the best and most elegant way to resolve this
         matter".

                      RYANAIR INCREASES BAGGAGE CHARGES TO
                         ENCOURAGE FREE ONLINE CHECK-IN
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 23rd January 2008)
announced that it is increasing checked-in baggage and airport check-in fees
with immediate effect for all new bookings as part of its continued drive to
encourage passengers to travel without checked in bags and avail of Ryanair's
free of charge online check in.
For all bookings made from today onwards, Ryanair's checked in baggage fee will
increase from GBP5 to GBP6 per bag and the airport check-in fee will increase from
GBP2 to GBP3. Ryanair hopes that these increases will encourage more passengers to
avoid these charges by travelling with its generous hand luggage allowance
(10kg) and checking in free of charge on-line, which also has the benefit of
free priority boarding.
Ryanair Holdings PLC BAGGAGE CHARGES INCREASE
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair remains determined to encourage more and more passengers to
         travel with carry on luggage only, which allows them to use our free of
         charge web check-in, skip airport queues and enjoy our priority boarding
         service free of charge.
        "We have already seen huge increases in the numbers of passengers using
         Ryanair's internet check-in since we made it free of charge last
         September. These increased charges will incentivise even more passengers
         to use our free web check-in service allowing us to cut airport and
         handling costs and further reduce our guaranteed lowest fares as we grow
         from 50 million to 60 million passengers in the coming year.
        "These will not be the last increases in Ryanair's checked in baggage or
         airport check in fees, which will continue to increase over time until
         we reach our objective of persuading at least 50% of all Ryanair
         passengers to travel with hand luggage only, use our free web check-in
         service and avoid airport check-in queues. This will in turn allow us to
         reduce the number of airport check-in desks that we rent and the
         handling staff we employ so that we can continue to pass on these
         handling savings in the form of Europe's guaranteed lowest fares"

                       EASYJET CLEARED TO BUY GB AIRWAYS
           ANOTHER APPROVED EU AIRLINE MERGER EXPOSES COMMISSION BIAS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 23rd January 2008)
again questioned the EU's politically motivated prohibition of the Ryanair / Aer
Lingus merger, following the latest approved European airline merger between
Easyjet and GB Airways.
This Easyjet / GB Airways merger (which was cleared by the UK's Office of Fair
 Trading last week) is the latest in a long sequence of approved European airline
 mergers (11 since 2002) and exposes the European Commission's double standards
 in applying a unique and discriminatory set of rules to block Ryanair's bid for
 Aer Lingus, (which combined represents less than 5% of EU air travel) while
 approving much larger mergers such as Air France / KLM and Lufthansa / Swiss.

By prohibiting the Ryanair / Aer Lingus merger, the European Commission broke
all airline merger precedents and ignored its own competition rules, in order to
serve the narrow vested interests of the Irish Government. Since the
prohibition, Aer Lingus has increased its fares and raised fuel surcharges,
whereas the pro consumer terms of Ryanair's bid guaranteed a fares reduction and
the removal of Aer Lingus' unfair fuel surcharges, saving EU passengers at least
EUR100m p.a.
Speaking today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said;
        "This latest approved European airline merger (Easyjet / GB Airways)
         makes the European Commission's decision to block Ryanair's bid for Aer
         Lingus untenable. The continuing wave of European airline consolidation
         clearly demonstrates that the European Commission is applying unfair and
         discriminatory rules to Ryanair, while encouraging all other European
         airlines to merge and consolidate. The prohibition of Ryanair's bid for
         Aer Lingus, which guaranteed over EUR100m p.a. in passenger savings
         including the removal of Aer Lingus' unjustified fuel surcharges was a
         biased, politically motivated, anti consumer decision.
        "As always with the European Commission, there is one set of rules for
         the flag carriers and a discriminatory set of rules for Ryanair. We
         again call on the European Commission to end this politically corrupt
         bias towards Ryanair by applying to it the same competition and merger
Ryanair Holdings PLC EASYJET TO BUY GB AIRWAYS
         rules they apply to Europe's flag carrier airlines.
        "The spotlight on the European Commission's bias will intensify further
         when it rubber stamps other mergers such as the ones presently
         contemplated between Air France/KLM and Alitalia and/or Lufthansa/Swiss
         and British Midlands".

Announcing Ryanair's 25th base in Birmingham, Michael O'Leary said:
        "The people of Birmingham have been woefully underserved and overcharged
         by British Airways and Flybe's high fares for years. Ryanair's new base
         will smash this high fare stranglehold by delivering savings of GBP130m
         next year for Birmingham's passengers / visitors.
        "Direct international routes are fundamental to the economic development
         of a city like Birmingham and the people of the West Midlands can now
         look forward to Europe's guaranteed lowest fares and best punctuality on
         22 international routes with Ryanair. This route count will more than
         double as a result of Ryanair's $700m investment in Birmingham, bringing
         with it a significant increase in European visitors and jobs for the
         West Midlands
        "To celebrate the launch of our new base, we are offering all passengers
         who buy a return flight on any route from Birmingham (before midnight on
         Thursday) a free bonus flight, (no taxes, no fees and no charges*) for
         travel in February to Dublin or Shannon from Birmingham. This special
         offer must end midnight Thursday so we advise passengers to book their
         bargain seats today on www.ryanair.com".

                Ryanair Welcomes DfT Decision on De-Designation
                   but Renews call for Breakup of BAA Monopoly
Ryanair, Europe's number one low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 15th January
2008) welcomed the decision of the UK Department for Transport to continue to
regulate the Stansted Airport monopoly in order "to protect passengers who use
the airport". Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly, on announcing the
decision said that the current situation "is bad for passengers in terms of
delays, congestion and lack of choice and it is also bad for the UK's
productivity and growth". The DfT's justified concerns make it all the more
inexplicable why the CAA proposed the crazy idea of de-regulating the Stansted
monopoly in the first place!
Ryanair renews its call on the Government to break up the BAA monopoly, which
currently controls over 90% of airport capacity in London. The CAA has been an
Ryanair Holdings PLC DfT Decision
abysmal failure to date as a regulator of this abusive monopoly, and has allowed
Stansted to double airport charges while providing abject service levels to
passengers.
Welcoming the announcement of DfT's decision, Ryanair's Jim Callaghan, said:
        "Ryanair welcomes the Secretary of State's recognition that passengers
         must be protected from the abusive BAA monopoly in Stansted Airport.
         However, the real scandal has been the failure of the CAA "poodles" to
         properly regulate this abusive monopoly, which is why the airlines have
         lost faith in the CAA's ability to protect the interests of users. The
         fact that it was the CAA who proposed this crazy de-designation idea in
         the first place shows how completely out of touch they are.
"Under the CAA's watch, the BAA Stansted monopoly has:
       Doubled airport charges in April 2007 and have announced further
         increases for 2008;
       Pushed ahead plans to spend GBP4 billion on a second terminal, despite
         the unanimous opposition of users;
       Failed to provide adequate service levels for passengers, which has
         led to ever longer queues at Stansted security and immigration;
       Failed to properly consult with users and ignored their needs in
         terms of efficient facilities and even basic service levels.
        "The only solution to the BAA monopoly is to break it up and allow each
         airport to develop additional capacity, which will enable them to
         compete with one another. Ryanair therefore renews its call on the
         Government to break up the BAA and to impose a robust regulatory regime
         (as opposed to the CAA "regulatory poodles") on the Stansted monopoly
         until such time as competition can replace regulation".

                  IALPA/IMPACT WITHDRAW CLAIMS AGAINST RYANAIR
                    DUBLIN PILOT RECOGNITION CASE COLLAPSES
Ryanair today (Monday, 14th January 2008) arrived at the Labour Court for the
scheduled hearing, which was ordered by the Supreme Court into IALPA/IMPACT 's 4
year old claims on behalf of the Dublin pilots. However IALPA/IMPACT failed to
show, having withdrawn their claims at the last minute, which has collapsed the
IALPA/IMPACT case.
This case stems from attempts by IALPA/IMPACT to use the Industrial Relations
Acts 2001 and 2004 to impose inefficient union practices on high pay, non union
companies like Ryanair through the back door of the Labour Court. Ryanair has
always contended that this legislation does not apply to high pay multinational
companies such as Ryanair, and this claim was successful in the Supreme Court.
This was why the Supreme Court directed that the case be reheard in front of the
Ryanair Holdings PLC IALPA/IMPACT WITHDRAWAL
Labour Court. The collapse of the IALPA/IMPACT case represents another
humiliating defeat for the Aer Lingus pilots union following their loss in the
Supreme Court, and their bill for Ryanair's legal costs (estimated at over EUR1m).
Today's climb down by IALPA/IMPACT exposes the false claims in their press
release of 1st February last on the day of the Supreme Court ruling. On that
date IMPACT's Michael Landers claimed:
"We see this ruling as no more than a temporary set back".
        "We look forward to an early rehearing and believe we have a strong case
         which we will present to the Labour Court in full accordance with the
         guidelines and principles laid down by the Supreme Court today".
The real losers - sadly - in this defeat have been Ryanair's Dublin pilots, who
were misled and misguided by IALPA/IMPACT for the past four years. These pilots,
acting on advice from IALPA/IMPACT, withdrew from the internal collective
bargaining system in Ryanair, and as a result they missed out on pay increases
and share options in 2005, 2006 and again in 2007. These pay increases and share
options were worth up to EUR80,000 for each Dublin Captain. Ryanair believes that
its Dublin pilots should strongly consider taking an action for damages against
IALPA/IMPACT for its misleading advice and this humiliating defeat and last
minute withdrawal. As usual Ryanair's pilots have been dumped by an Aer Lingus
union.
Speaking this morning on the steps of the Labour Court, Ryanair's Eddie Wilson
said:
        "IALPA/IMPACT have spent over 20 years trying and failing to unionise
         Ryanair. Their false promises and false claims have cost our Dublin
         pilots considerable sums of money. Perhaps it is time that the trade
         unions in Ireland recognised that they have no role to play in high pay
         multi-national companies like Ryanair, where our sophisticated internal
         collective bargaining arrangements deliver better pay, faster promotions
         and better working conditions for our people than those being delivered
         to union members by our unionised competitors.
        "We trust that those outlets in the Irish media, who routinely give
         undue weight to false claims being made by unions, will in future make a
         better effort to report on these matters in Ryanair with some
         objectivity and balance. The fact that Mr Landers claimed in February
         that the Supreme Court ruling was a "temporary set back" and that "he
         looked forward to an early rehearing at the Labour Court", only to
         withdraw all of these claims at the eleventh hour, highlights the extent
         to which the unions mislead and spin on matters relating to Ryanair.
        "We welcome this latest defeat for IALPA/IMPACT, the Aer Lingus pilot
         union, which is another victory for Ryanair's people and secures their
Ryanair Holdings PLC IALPA/IMPACT WITHDRAWAL
         right to continue to negotiate directly with us for many years into the
         future. The real lesson in this shambles for Ryanair's Dublin pilots, is
         that their best interests can only be secured by negotiating directly
         with the company to improve pay and conditions while ignoring the false
         claims and misleading advice from IALPA/IMPACT which has yet again cost
         Ryanair's Dublin pilots many thousands of euro."

Ryanair Holdings PLC
20 December 2007
                     RYANAIR WINS LONDON HIGH COURT ACTION
            "DAA AND SRT FOUND TO HAVE COLLABORATED AGAINST RYANAIR"
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline today (Dec 20) in the High Court in London
won the case for an injunction against SRT (SR Technics) to prevent them (and
the DAA) attempting to force Ryanair to vacate Hangar 1; as well as an order for
specific performance against SRT which must use its best endeavours to obtain a
15 year licence to allow Ryanair to use Hangar 1 on such terms as the DAA may
reasonably consent.
Today's judgment by the Honourable Mr Justice Gray, was critical of both SRT and
the DAA for their behaviour. Amongst other findings in his judgment, Mr Justice
Gray found:
   "SRT has failed lamentably to comply with its disclosure obligations".
    "I am doubtful even now if all relevant Board meetings have been
     disclosed (by SRT)".
    "I am in no doubt at all that SRT was in persistent and clear breach of
Ryanair Holdings PLC LONDON HIGH COURT ACTION
     its obligations in relation to obtaining consent from the DAA to a licence
     in favour of Ryanair".
    "Attempts made in the course of the trial to elicit documents from the
     DAA achieved nothing".
    "I reject the evidence of Mr Murphy (DAA).
    "Mr Collier, Chief Executive of the DAA unhelpfully replied that it would
     not be appropriate for the DAA to discuss commercial discussions it might or
     might not be having with third parties. This reply typifies the attitude of
     the DAA to requests for documentary assistance in connection with this
     matter".
    "The note of the meeting which took place between SRT and representatives
     of the DAA on 10 July 2007 reveals that the proposal at that stage was that
     the DAA would pay SRT EUR5m for relinquishing possession of Hangars 1 and 2.
     The likely tenant at Hangar 1 was to be Aer Lingus. The concluding reference
     in that note is indicative of the collaboration which by then existed
     between the DAA and SRT".
    "Nor do I accept that Irish Landlord and Tenant Legislation in reality
     prevented the DAA from granting a lease of over 5 years duration".
    "Damages would not in my view constitute an adequate remedy in the
     circumstances which obtain here".
Welcoming today's High Court Judgement in favour of Ryanair, Chief Executive,
Michael O'Leary said:
    "We welcome both the findings and the decision of Mr Justice Gray to require
     SRT to honour its agreement to provide Ryanair with a 15 year licence to use
     Hangar 1 at Dublin Airport.
    "It is disappointing that Ryanair was forced by the actions of both SRT and
     the DAA to pursue this matter through the High Courts in London. We share Mr
     Justice Gray's concern that neither SRT nor the DAA gave full disclosure of
     their records and documents to the High Court, but even the limited
     disclosure which was provided, conclusively reveals that the DAA was
     collaborating with SRT to throw Ryanair out of Hangar 1 so that the DAA
     could pay SRT EUR5m to regain possession of it, and then lease it to Aer
     Lingus. The fact that Executives of SRT and the DAA have been found to have
     obstructed the Court, and their evidence was rejected, is indicative of the
     low standards of honesty and probity that apply to both companies.
    "The fact that the DAA monopoly has been found to have collaborated with
     SRT, to force Ryanair out of Hangar 1, so that the DAA could lease the
     facility instead to Aer Lingus is I believe indicative of the way that the
     DAA monopoly repeatedly abuses its monopoly power here at Dublin Airport.
    "Ryanair will now consider the detailed judgement of Mr Justice Gray with
     our lawyers. We will be writing to the Minister for Transport and Mr Gary
     McGann, the Chairman of the DAA monopoly, asking that appropriate
     disciplinary measures up to and including dismissal should now be considered
     in the case of Mr Collier, the DAA's Chief Executive, Mr McGowan, the DAA's
     Property Manager and any other executives of the DAA who refused to
     cooperate fully with the High Court in London and who engaged in this
     "collaboration" with SRT against its largest customer, Ryanair."
    "I never cease to be amazed by the extent to which the Department of
     Transport, the DAA monopoly and Aer Lingus are prepared to "collaborate" in
     their attempts to protect and assist each other, while doing their utmost to
     disadvantage Ryanair, Ireland's largest and favourite airline"

                3 NEW ROUTES - DUBLIN TO BREST, RODEZ AND TOURS
    Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (Thursday, 13th December 2007)
     announced 3 new routes from Dublin to Brest, Rodez and Tours starting from
     April 2008. Ryanair will guarantee the lowest fares for over 13 million
     passengers on 137 routes to / from Ireland next year. No other airline
     carries as many Irish passengers / visitors because only Ryanair guarantees
     the lowest fares.
    Announcing the new routes in Dublin today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary
     said:
        "Today's three new routes give Ryanair passengers a choice of 11 French
         destinations from Dublin for less than half the price of Aer Lingus. Aer
         Lingus simply can't compete with Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and
         punctuality, which is why Aer Lingus have recently withdrawn routes from
         Dublin to Newcastle, Seville and Poznan where they competed directly
         with Ryanair. Next year, 10 million passengers will make Ryanair their
         number one choice to / from Dublin, generating a visitor spend of EUR1.5
         billion in the capital, and supporting 10,000 Dublin jobs.
        "To celebrate the launch of this French trio, Ryanair is releasing
         250,000 EUR10* seats across its 84 Dublin routes. We advise passengers to
         book today because these bargains will be snapped up in record time".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
11 December 2007
                       RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 5 NEW ROUTES AND
                 A 5th AIRCRAFT AT ITS BRUSSELS CHARLEROI BASE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th December 2007)
announced 5 new routes from Brussels Charleroi to Bergerac, Limoges, Perpignan,
Porto and Zaragoza and a 5th Boeing 737-800 aircraft will be based in the
Belgian capital from 5th March. Next summer (2008), Ryanair will operate 26
routes to / from Brussels Charleroi in 2008, carrying over 2.5m passengers who
will sustain over 2,500 Belgian jobs in Wallonia.
BSCA's partnership with Ryanair continues to be a huge success, transforming
Brussels Charleroi airport from an empty, loss making white elephant into a
profitable, thriving, wealth generator. Ryanair welcomes the opening of BSCA's
new terminal in January 2008 which will deliver more low fare routes and more
visitors for the Walloon region. The continuing benefits of Ryanair's growth at
Ryanair Holdings PLC NEW ROUTES AT CHARLEROI BASE
BSCA for the airport and the Walloon region highlights the absurdity of the
Commission's flawed and untenable 2003 state aid ruling at Charleroi. Ryanair is
confident that this unlawful ruling will be overturned on appeal by the European
Court of First Instance. This appeal will be heard in Feb 2008.
The European Commission continues to adopt a biased and discriminatory approach
to State Aid cases by repeatedly ignoring Ryanair complaints about EUR billions of
state aid provided to inefficient flag carriers while investigating spurious
complaints by competitors, about free market deals at tiny regional airports
which are perfectly lawful under the Commission's market investor principal.
Ryanair looks forward the European Commission being forced by the ECI to address
the following flagrant breaches of state aid rules which it has ignored for the
past two years:
   State aid of EUR1bn to Air France in the form of reduced domestic airport
     charges
    State aid of EUR100m to Lufthansa through its sole use of loss making T2 at
     Munich
    State aid of over EUR500m to the loss making Olympic Airways in Greece
    State aid of over EUR20m to Alitalia's subsidiary, Volare, through airport
     debt write-offs
    State aid of over 1.7bn to Alitalia through recapitalisation and debt
     write-off
Announcing Ryanair's latest expansion in Brussels, CEO Michael O'Leary said:
        "Ryanair's 5 new routes at Brussels Charleroi are great news for Belgian
         tourism, Belgian business and Belgian consumers who will enjoy even more
         of Europe's guaranteed lowest fares to 26 destinations next year. We are
         delighted that BSCA continues to grow and prosper with Ryanair and
         welcome the opening of their new terminal which will enable the
         development of even more low fare routes for Belgian passengers /
         visitors.
        "The huge success of the BSCA's low cost agreement with Ryanair exposes
         the stupidity of the EU's unlawful decision at Charleroi. We look
         forward to the European Court of First Instance forcing the European
         Commission to end their discrimination by addressing the real and
         repeated breaches of state aid to flag carriers which they have ignored
         for the past two years.
        "To celebrate these 5 new routes from Brussels Charleroi, we are
         releasing 100,000 seats for travel between January and March for just
         EUR10 including taxes on www.ryanair.com. We advise passengers to book
         immediately as this offer will end midnight Thursday".
To accommodate these 5 new routes, Ryanair will stop flying from Brussels to
London Stansted from 5th March 2008.

            RYANAIR CALLS ON EU TO STOP AIR FRANCE BID FOR ALITALIA
                    UNTIL EUR2.7BN ILLEGAL STATE AID IS REPAID
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 6th December 2007)
called on the European Commission to block Air France's bid for Alitalia until
both airlines have paid back a combined EUR2.7bn in illegal state aid received
from the French and Italian Governments.
Two years ago, Ryanair filed two separate State Aid complaints with the European
Commission about EUR1bn illegal state aid given to Air France in the form of
discounted domestic passenger charges and EUR1.7bn illegal state aid given to
Alitalia in the form of debt write offs. Despite these flagrant breaches of
state aid rules, the European Commission has failed to act on either case in the
last two years.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC CALL ON EU TO STOP AF BID
        "The European Commission's failure to address these serious state aid
         complaints shows that it has one set of rules for high fare flag carrier
         airlines and another for efficient low fare airlines like Ryanair. We
         call on the European Commission to block Air France's bid for Alitalia
         until such time as these two state aid complaints have been addressed
         and the combined EUR2.7bn in illegal state aid is repaid".

             RYANAIR SUES EUROPEAN COMMISSION (FOR THE FIFTH TIME)
                FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL STATE AID
                         OF OVER EUR2 BILLION TO ALITALIA
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (Friday, 30th November
2007) lodged its fifth case in recent weeks in the European Court of First
Instance against the European Commission's repeated failure to investigate
illegal State aid to national flag carrier airlines. The previous four cases
include:
   State aid of over EUR1bn to Air France in the form of reduced domestic
     airport charges;
    State aid of over EUR100m to Lufthansa through its use of the loss-making
     Terminal 2 at Munich Airport;
    State aid of over EUR500m to the loss making Olympic Airways in Greece;
    State aid of over EUR20m to Alitalia's subsidiary, Volare, through a
     write-off in airport debts.
This latest (fifth) case involves the Commission's failure to act on Ryanair's
complaint about continuing illegal State aid to Alitalia. The aid consisted of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Sues EC for 5th Time
several measures, including a split-up of the company's assets and operations
and uneven allocation of the debt, resulting in a EUR1.7 billion debt write-off
for Alitalia. Ryanair called on the Commission to investigate this blatant abuse
of EU competition rules over 2 years ago, but the Commission has so far failed
to do so.
Announcing the launch of these proceedings Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said:
        "The ongoing State aid to Alitalia is a perfect example of the
         Commission's bias towards inefficient national airlines. Alitalia is now
         losing in excess of EUR400 million per annum and the Italian government
         continues to illegally bail it out. Even dogs in the streets of Brussels
         know that Alitalia is receiving illegal State aid, yet DG TREN continues
         to ignore this blatant State aid, preferring instead to prosecute tiny
         regional airports like Pau in the south of France.
        "Following the Commission's failure to investigate this case, we are
         left with no alternative - yet again - but to challenge this further
         inaction in the European courts. We are calling on the Commission to end
         its discriminatory and biased approach to State aid enforcement, to
         start promoting competition and consumer choice, and to put an end to
         this scandal of unlawful State aid to flag carrier airlines".

            BEST PUNCTUALITY, FEWEST LOST BAGS, FEWEST CANCELLATIONS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Friday, 30th November 2007)
welcomed the release of the Association of European Airlines' latest consumer
report, which again demonstrates that the high fare, fuel surcharging airlines
can't match Ryanair's punctuality and customer service.
These statistics show that airlines which like to talk service simply don't
deliver it. Four out of ten British Airways flights are delayed, compared to
just 1 in 10 with Ryanair, while your bag is now nearly 40 times more likely to
go missing if you are travelling with British Airways.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "The high fare airlines can't match Ryanair's guaranteed low fares and
         as these statistics prove, they can't compete with our customer service
         either. Ryanair is Europe's undisputed champion for customer service,
         delivering our passengers to their destination on-time and for the

                     RYANAIR AGAIN SUES EUROPEAN COMMISSION
                 FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL STATE AID
                            TO ITALIAN AIRLINE VOLARE
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (Thursday, 29th November
2007) lodged a further (fourth) case in the European Court of First Instance
against the European Commission's failure to act on Ryanair's complaint about
illegal State aid to a subsidiary of Alitalia - Volare. The aid consisted of the
write-off of around EUR20 million in debts owed by Volare to Italian airports and
reductions in airport charges and fuel costs in favour of Volare. Ryanair has
called on the Commission to investigate this obvious abuse of EU competition
rules over 2 years ago, but the Commission has so far failed to do so.
Announcing the launch of these proceedings Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said:
    "This is just another example of the Commission's favouritism towards
     inefficient national airlines and its bias against small regional and
     secondary airports and the low fares airlines. On one hand, the Commission
     repeatedly ignores blatant State aid to Alitalia and its subsidiaries, and
Ryanair Holdings PLC SUE EC OVER AID TO VOLARE
     to Air France, Lufthansa, Olympic, and others. The Italian Government's
     recurring attempts to protect "Italian aviation" include the bail out of
     Volare and its subsequent transfer to Alitalia. The write-off of some EUR20
     million of airport debts is a blatant abuse of EU State aid rules, yet the
     Commission has refused to do anything about this since 2005. We were left
     with no alternative but to challenge the Commission's inaction in the
     European courts.
    "On the other hand the Commission continues to waste time and taxpayers'
     money investigating spurious complaints against standard free market deals
     at regional and secondary airports, for example Tampere and Alghero. These
     investigations were prompted by inefficient high fare flag carrier airlines
     operating at expensive hub airports, who would never fly to these smaller
     airports and are simply trying to block competition and consumer choice.
     Only yesterday the Commission announced another pointless investigation, at
     the tiny regional airport of Pau in south-west France.
    "This discriminatory and biased approach to the enforcement of the State aid
     rules by the Commission, which is damaging the industry and harming
     consumers, must end! We are therefore calling on the Commission to start
     promoting competition and consumer choice, put an end to unlawful State aid
     to flag carrier airlines, and stop protecting these inefficient airlines and
     their subsidiaries".

              RYANAIR CONDEMNS EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S LATEST ABUSE
                              OF THE STATE AID RULES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 28th November
2007) criticised the EU Commission for its ongoing bias in the enforcement of
the state aid rules and for continuing to bring baseless cases against tiny
regional airports like Pau and Tampere while failing to take any action on the
numerous state aid cases against flag carrier airlines brought by Ryanair.
Ryanair has filed complaints regarding over EUR1 billion in illegal state aid
provided by the French Government to Air France (in the form of discounted
domestic fees); hundreds of millions in subsidies to Lufthansa (below market
airport charges and exclusive use of the new terminal in Munich); and blatant
ongoing state aid by the Italian and Greek Governments who continue to bail out
their terminally ill national airlines.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR CONDEMNS COMMISSION
Meanwhile, the mighty EU Commission continues to take completely spurious
actions against tiny regional and secondary airports such as Pau, Tampere,
Luebeck and Alghero, who are trying to develop traffic and provide competition
and choice to European consumers. These investigations are based on spurious
complaints by flag carrier airlines trying to block competition and undermine
the growth of these small airports. The complaint in Pau is a complete nonsense
and is further evidence that the Commission (DG TREN) operates a discriminatory
system by ignoring billions of illegal state aid to the flag carrier airlines,
while launching ridiculous state aid investigations to undermine competition at
tiny regional airports.
Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
        "This is further proof that the EU Commission (DG TREN) operates one
         rule for the flag carrier airlines and their National Governments, who
         continue to provide massive amounts of illegal state aid to them, and a
         completely different rule for tiny airports like Pau who are bringing
         low fares competition and choice to European consumers and are
         developing traffic and new routes to destinations around Europe, which
         were formerly denied to them by Air France and others.
        "The politically corrupt way in which the Commission applies these the
         state aid rules is demonstrated by their legally flawed decision in the
         Charleroi case, an airport that has experienced phenomenal growth in the
         past three years (since the decision) and the airport is about to open a
         brand new terminal. Ryanair has been pushing to get a hearing in the
         European courts to have this decision overturned but the Commission is
         delaying this hearing.
        "We will continue to fight these ongoing abuses by the Commission of its
         state aid rules and its corrupt failure to investigate the real culprits
         - the flag carriers - who continue to be massively supported and
         subsidised by their national Governments".

                        RYANAIR SUES EUROPEAN COMMISSION
                FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL STATE AID
                              TO OLYMPIC AIRLINES
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (Thursday, 22nd November
2007) lodged a case in the European Court of First Instance against the European
Commission's failure to act on Ryanair's complaint about a further approximately
EUR500 million worth of illegal State aid to Olympic Airlines, granted through
bogus "arbitration" proceedings involving certain "services" allegedly provided
by Olympic to the Greek Government. The Greek Government was found guilty of
providing hundreds of millions to Olympic to bail it out in the past and this is
the latest attempt to prop up this failed national carrier. Ryanair has called
on the Commission to investigate this obvious abuse of EU competition rules
already in 2006, but the Commission has so far failed to do so.
Ryanair Holdings PLC CFI ACTION-OLYMPIC COMPLAINT
Announcing the launch of these proceedings Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said:
        "This is just another example of the Commission's twin track approach to
         State aid in the air transport sector. On one hand they continue to
         waste time and taxpayers money investigating baseless complaints against
         standard free market deals at regional and secondary airports, for
         example Tampere and Alghero. These complaints were filed by inefficient
         high fare flag carrier airlines operating at expensive hub airports, who
         would never fly to smaller airports and are simply trying to prevent
         competition and consumer choice.
        "On the other hand, the Commission repeatedly ignores blatant State aid
         to Air France, Lufthansa, Olympic, Alitalia and others. The Greek
         Government's most recent tranche of State aid to Olympic involves
         approximately EUR500 million, mostly for "unpaid services" allegedly
         provided by Olympic to the Government. However, the Commission has
         refused to do anything about this since 2006, which left us with no
         alternative but to challenge the Commission's inaction in the European
         courts.
        "It appears that the Commission applies two approaches to enforcing the
         State aid rules: one of ignoring or signing off on continuing unlawful
         State aid for the inefficient high fare flag carrier airlines, and the
         other of pursuing baseless complaints by flag carriers against low fares
         airlines operating out of regional and secondary airports. This twin
         track approach must end and we are therefore calling on the Commission
         to start promoting competition, end unlawful State aid, and stop
         protecting flag carrier airlines".

                   Ryanair responds to Aer Lingus CFI appeal
Ryanair, today (Monday, 19th November 2007) dismissed the Aer Lingus
announcement of its intention to submit an appeal to the European Court of First
Instance seeking to force Ryanair to dispose of its 29% shareholding in Aer
Lingus plc.
The European Commission has already confirmed that since Ryanair has neither de
facto nor de jure control over Aer Lingus, there are no legal grounds for such a
compulsory disposal. Ryanair's lack of control or indeed even our influence over
Aer Lingus was recently highlighted by the two separate refusals by the Aer
Lingus Board to hold an EGM at the request of Ryanair to allow shareholders to
consider Aer Lingus's abandonment of its profitable Shannon-Heathrow route.
Ryanair has no doubt that this appeal will be dismissed.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RESPONSE TO AL CFI APPEAL
        "This appeal would seem to be another smokescreen from the Board of Aer
         Lingus to distract from its awful performance over the past 12 months.
         Aer Lingus's share price closed last week at EUR2.15, almost 25% lower
         than Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer in October last year, and some 5c per share
         less than Aer Lingus's original float price in September 2006.
        "It is clear that the market has little faith in the Board of Aer
         Lingus, who last year advised shareholders to reject an offer of EUR2.80,
         but have presided over the withdrawal of its Dubai route, a succession
         of labour problems and the collapse in its share price
        "Perhaps if the Board of Aer Lingus spent more time improving the
         management of the airline and its share price, they wouldn't have to
         waste time worrying about Ryanair's minority shareholding".

        Aer Lingus lodges formal appeal with EU Court of First Instance
Dublin & London, 19 November 2007: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or "the
Company") has confirmed that it will today lodge its formal appeal with the EU
Court of First Instance in Luxembourg as part of the legal process towards
removing Ryanair from its shareholder register.
If successful, the appeal will enable the EU Commission to order Ryanair to
 dispose of its stake in its main competitor.   This follows on from the EU
 Commission's recent decision that it does not have the legal authority to order
 a sell down of Ryanair's shares under Merger Regulation.  Aer Lingus is
 confident that the Regulation does give the Commission that power as the stake
 was part of the original takeover attempt which the Commission prohibited.
Aer Lingus has also asked the Court, as a matter of urgency, to make an order to
prevent Ryanair from interfering in the running of Aer Lingus' business pending
judgement on the appeal.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Appeal to EU Court
Commenting, John Sharman, Aer Lingus Chairman, said: "Aer Lingus is forging
ahead with its plans for growth and refuses to be undermined by its competitor.
It is our intention to deal with the presence of Ryanair on our shareholder
register decisively through short-term interim measures, as well as seeking a
speedy permanent resolution from the Court of First Instance."

              RYANAIR LOOKS FORWARD TO SEEING AIR FRANCE IN COURT
Speaking this afternoon, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard, said:
        "Ryanair looks forward to seeing Air France in yet another French Court,
         on yet another silly claim by Air France. Air France cannot deny the
         fact of Ryanair's complaint to the European Commission. Air France has
         repeatedly raised its unjustified fuel surcharges within hours of many
         other high fares airlines, and no amount of Court cases can hide the
         fact that Air France is using unjustified fuel surcharges to increase
         fares for consumers.
        "Ryanair didn't "leak" this EU complaint to the press as Air France
         falsely claims. Ryanair issued a press release on Thursday 11th October
         (see below in order to provide the press with the full details of its EU
         price fixing complaint. It appears that Air France are not content with
         trying to limit competition and choice for air travel in France, now it
         seems they want to limit free speech as well.
        "Ryanair again calls on the EU Commission to end the scandal of
         unjustified flag carrier fuel surcharges when low fares airlines like
         Ryanair offer not just lower fares, but guarantee no fuel surcharges
         either".

 RYANAIR SUES EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL STATE
                        AID TO LUFTHANSA AT MUNICH AIRPORT
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 14th November
2007) lodged a case in the European Court of First Instance against the European
Commission's failure to act on Ryanair's complaint regarding illegal State aid
granted by the German authorities to Lufthansa at Terminal 2 in Munich Airport.
The Commission has ignored Ryanair's calls for an investigation of this obvious
abuse of the EU State aid rules for over two years.
Announcing the launch of these proceedings, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO,
said:
"Lufthansa / Star Alliance have exclusive use of Terminal 2 in Munich, which was
provided at a cost of EUR1.5 billion (over EUR1 billion paid by the German
Government and the Regional Authorities), and which has led to the airport
Ryanair Holdings PLC LH ILLEGAL STATE AID
incurring losses of over EUR100 million in 2004-2005. No private investor would
have invested in the loss making facility and then granted exclusive access to
just one airline. Lufthansa is therefore receiving substantial State aid at
Munich airport, which distorts competition in the European air transport market.
"We have called on the European Commission to investigate these serious
distortions of competition in favour of Lufthansa at Munich. Munich Airport's
refusal to allow Ryanair to use this facility has subjected passengers in
Bavaria to the stranglehold of Lufthansa's high fares and fuel surcharges while
Lufthansa has unfairly benefited from substantial amounts of State aid.
"Ryanair has been left with no alternative but to challenge the Commission's
inaction in the European courts. We are calling on the Commission to start
promoting competition and to stop protecting flag carrier high fare airlines
which continue to receive large amounts of unlawful State aid."

                  RYANAIR RESPONDS TO LATEST COMMISSION LEAKS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 13th November 2007)
welcomed the latest European Commission leaks about airline pricing. It has been
reported in today's newspapers that the European Consumer Affairs Commissioner,
Maglena Kuneva has carried out an investigation into airline price advertising.
Ryanair is confident that any such investigation will highlight:
Availability
        1) That no other airline matches Ryanair's low fares availability with
         over 50% of all seats (25 m this year) sold at the lowest two fares.
        2) Ryanair's average fare of EUR44 is the lowest in Europe, with Easyjet's
         (EUR66) 50% higher than Ryanair's. Ryanair's average fare is half the
         price of Aer Lingus' (EUR91) and less than a fifth of Air France (EUR220),
         Lufthansa (EUR237) and British Airways' (EUR268) average fares. Only Ryanair
         offers EU consumers a lowest fare guarantee.
        3) Ryanair is also the only airline to guarantee no fuel surcharges
         ever, while British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa continue to raise
         their unfair fuel surcharges, despite having hedged their fuel at $65 to
         $75 per barrel, some $25 below market prices.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RESPONSE TO COMMISSION LEAKS
Clear Pricing
All prices advertised on Ryanair.com's home page and all of Ryanair's media
advertising is fully tax inclusive.
Opt out insurance
Over 95% of Ryanair's passengers currently decline optional insurance on
Ryanair.com, which conclusively demonstrates that it is both easy to use, easy
to decline and entirely optional.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair calls on Commissioner Kuneva to widen her investigation to
         cover the real scandal of unfair fuel surcharge increases being levied
         by BA (raised from GBP43 to GBP58 yesterday), Air France (raised from EUR63 to
         EUR73 yesterday), KLM (raised from EUR60 to EUR70 yesterday) and Lufthansa
         (raised EUR67 to EUR77 yesterday), when these airlines have all confirmed
         that they have hedged (or bought forward) their fuel at $65 to $75 per
         barrel, some $25 below market prices.
        "Ryanair hasn't been contacted by the EU Commission as part of this
         alleged investigation but we would welcome any proposals by the
         Commission to force Europe's high fare airlines to match Ryanair's
         fares, our inclusive advertising, our low fare availability and our
         guarantee of no fuel surcharges ever".

  RYANAIR SUES EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE EUR1BILLION OF
                             STATE AID TO AIR FRANCE
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today, (Thursday, 8th November
2007), (exactly 18 months after its original complaint), lodged a case in the
European Court of First Instance against the European Commission's failure to
act on Ryanair's complaint about EUR1 billion worth of State to Air France in the
form of unlawful reduced domestic airport charges in France. Ryanair has called
on the Commission several times to investigate this obvious abuse of EU
competition rules, but the Commission has repeatedly failed to do so.
Announcing the launch of these proceedings Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said:
        "This is just another example of the Commission's uneven-handed
         application of the State aid rules. They apply one rule to flag carriers
         by ignoring blatant State aid to Air France, Alitalia, Olympic,
         Lufthansa among others, while at the same time wasting time and money
         investigating baseless complaints from flag carrier airlines against
         open market commercial deals at regional and secondary airports. Recent
         examples of this include investigations at Tampere airport in Finland
Ryanair Holdings PLC Statement re: Sues EU Comm...
         and Alghero airport in Sardinia. These complaints were filed by flag
         carrier airlines operating at expensive hub airports, who would never
         fly to smaller airports and are only trying to prevent competition and
         consumer choice.
        "On the other hand, the Commission refuses to act on legitimate
         complaints against serious violations of the State aid rules by National
         Governments to protect their flag carrier airlines. The French
         Government's operation of massively discounted domestic airport fees in
         France - almost all of which supports Air France - amounts to
         approximately EUR1bn of illegal State aid to the benefit of Air France,
         yet the Commission has refused to do anything about this for the last 18
         months! The Commission has previously outlawed differentiated domestic/
         intra EU airport charges in Finland, Portugal, the UK and Ireland, so
         why should France be any different?
        "It appears that the Commission applies different rules for the high
         fare flag carrier airlines compared to low fares airlines. We are
         calling on the Commission to start promoting competition and stop
         protecting flag carrier airlines who continue to receive unlawful State
         aid."

Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
"These record profits reflect a 20% growth in passenger volumes, a 1% decline in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced
yields, and strong ancillary growth. Ancillary revenues grew by 54% to EUR252m,
due to improved penetration of car hire, hotels, travel insurance, as well as
strong onboard sales and excess baggage revenues. Ancillaries now account for
just over 16% of total revenues as we make steady progress towards our 20%
target. Our inflight mobile phone service will be tested on 25 aircraft before
the end of March 2008 which will allow passengers to make and receive calls and
texts on their mobile phones and blackberrys.
Unit costs rose by 5%, slightly lower than expected, due to the higher oil
prices, doubling of airport charges at Stansted as well as significantly higher
charges for portacabin facilities at the Dublin airport monopoly. Staff costs
rose by 29% to EUR146.3m due to volume growth, an employee share option charge of
EUR9.1m, and increased cabin crew ratios. We continue to aggressively tackle costs
and anticipate that unit costs for the remainder of the year will grow by 5%,
slightly lower than previously guided.
The UK Competition Commission's investigation of the BAA monopoly clearly
confirmed that they are responsible for the abysmal service and long security
queues which passengers are suffering at Stansted airport. This report also
highlighted the negative impact of the BAA's monopoly ownership of the main
London airports which has resulted in excessive charges and retarded their
development. We believe that the BAA's abusive monopoly should be broken up,
urgently, if the best interests of consumers are to be realised. Competition
works - airport monopolies don't. The CAA has repeatedly failed to effectively
regulate this monopoly which is why it continues to provide third world service
levels, at extortionate prices, especially at Stansted, where users'
requirements are repeatedly ignored by an airport which plans to waste GBP4bn
building a gold plated second terminal and runway when these facilities should
be provided at less than one quarter of this cost.
Our new routes and bases have performed well over the summer. This winter we
will open 4 new bases at Alicante and Valencia in Spain, Belfast City in
Northern Ireland, and Bristol in the UK. We will also start over 130 new routes
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced
across Europe. Advance bookings on our new routes and bases are in line with our
winter targets. We intend to announce a further 1 or possibly 2 bases in the
coming weeks for launch during next summer's schedule.
We have recently concluded direct negotiations and a new four year agreement
with our Dublin based pilots which will significantly improve their pay and
rosters and bring them in line with the better pay and benefits previously
negotiated by pilots at our other Irish bases. Sadly, the failed attempts by the
Irish Airline Pilots Union ("IALPA") to interfere in Ryanair's direct
negotiations with our pilots has cost each of our Dublin Captains over EUR80k each over
the past 4 years. We are pleased that the Dublin pilots have finally recognised
the abject failure of this IALPA led campaign and have returned to talking
directly with us.
We have now launched our free web check-in/priority boarding facility for all
passengers travelling with hand luggage which allows them to avoid airport
queues and be amongst the first to board the aircraft. Passengers who do not
avail of free web check-in/priority boarding will be charged GBP2/EUR3 for using
airport check-in. As a further innovation all passengers can now purchase
priority boarding online and at airport ticket desks. These service enhancements
have been well received by passengers resulting in the doubling of passengers
using priority boarding/web check-in in the first month since its introduction.
Chancellor Alistair Darling's plans to change the basis of UK APD in 2009 from a
per passenger charge to a per flight charge fails to address the fundamental
inequity of this travel tax scam. Aviation, which accounts for less than 2% of
EU CO2 emissions (just half the figure for marine transport), is not the cause
of climate change and taxing it will not have any effect on this problem. Not one
penny of the extra GBP1bn raised annually by this UK travel tax scam has been
spent on environmental projects. Despite repeated requests, the UK Treasury
refuses to confirm how this money will be spent. The reality is that this is
just another Government tax on passengers and we again call on the Chancellor to
end this modern day highway robbery.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced
We have implemented our planned 20% reduction in Stansted aircraft numbers this
winter due to the doubling of costs by the BAA monopoly. As a result we
anticipate that full year passenger volumes will grow by approximately 19% to
50.5m. These capacity reductions will bring more stability to winter yields,
reduce operating costs and eliminate losses on non profitable winter routes at
Stansted.
Our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year remains cautious as we have
very little visibility beyond the next two months. Shareholders should note that
the anticipated decline in Q3 yields will result in Net Profit being
significantly lower than last year's Q3 comparative which included a one off
settlement arising from an early contract termination by our hotel partner.
Based on our current Q3 forward bookings and the impact of Easter in Q4, we now
anticipate that winter (H2) yields will be somewhat better than previously
forecast with the expected yield declines being towards the lower end of the -5%
to -10% range. As a result of these better winter yield forecasts and the costs
savings which we continue to realise, we now believe that full year Net Profit
will rise by 17.5% to approximately EUR470m, rather than the EUR440 previously
guided.
During the last two months we undertook a series of share buy backs amounting to
a total of 53.5m shares at a cost of EUR267m. The shares cancelled represent
approximately 3.5% of the company's pre-existing issued share capital.
To celebrate these record half year results today, we have launched a 4m seat sale
with fares at EUR10/GBP10 inclusive".

 All of Ryanair's 5,000 people wish to extend their sincere and deepest
 sympathies to the family and many friends of DR TONY RYAN who died on the 3rd
 October 2007, after a long illness.
Dr Ryan founded Ryanair 23 years ago. He persevered when all others lost faith.
His vision, leadership and ambition inspired Ryanair's growth to become the
world's biggest international passenger airline. He was and will remain an
inspiration to all of us.
It is rare that one man in his own lifetime can transform the lives of millions.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced
Dr Ryan did so by pioneering competition and low fare air travel in Europe.
Ryanair is proud to bear his name and his legacy. We will miss him greatly.
Dr Ryan and the Ryan family are in our thoughts and prayers at this time. May he
 rest in peace.

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is
subject to important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially. It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the many
factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an
airline operating in the European economy. Among the factors that are subject to
change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are the airline
pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers,
market prices for the replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental,
safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union ("EU")
and other Governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in
currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general
economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general
willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political
factors.
Ryanair is Europe's largest low fares airline with 23 bases and 563 low fare
routes across 26 countries. By the end of March 2008 Ryanair will operate a
fleet of 163 Boeing 737-800 aircraft with firm orders for a further 99 new
aircraft (net of planned disposals), which will be delivered over the next 5
years. Ryanair currently employs a team of 5,000 people and expects to carry
circa 50.5 million scheduled passengers in the current fiscal year.

Profit after tax, increased by 26% to EUR268.7m due to a 22% increase in passenger
numbers, a 1% decrease in fares (including checked in baggage revenues) and
strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was offset by a
combination of increased airport costs which rose by 50% to EUR107.1m arising from
the doubling of airport charges at Stansted and higher charges at Dublin
Airport, and a one off step up in staff costs, primarily due to higher cabin
crewing ratios, which rose by 23% to EUR70.4m. Operating margins, as a result,
decreased by 1 point to 35%, which in turn resulted in operating profit
increasing by 22% to EUR304.0m compared to the previous quarter ended September
30, 2006.
Total operating revenues increased by 25% to EUR861.3m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 22% to 14.0m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 3% due to
strong ancillary revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 21% to EUR726.1m due to a 22% increase
in traffic reflecting increased passenger numbers on existing routes and the
successful launch of new routes and bases. During the period average fares
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -5-
(including checked baggage revenues) were down by 1% whilst load factor remained
flat at 89% during the quarter.
Ancillary revenues continue to grow faster than passenger volumes with revenues
increasing by 54% to EUR135.3m in the quarter. This performance reflects the
strong growth in on board sales, excess baggage revenues, non-flight scheduled
revenue and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 26% to EUR557.3m due to the increased level of
activity, and the increased costs associated with the growth of the airline
particularly higher airport charges and staff costs. Total operating expenses
were also adversely impacted by a 7% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 23% to EUR70.4m. This primarily reflects a 29%
increase in average employee numbers to 5,024 and the impact of pay increases
granted during the year. Employee numbers rose due to an increase in cabin
crewing ratios as a result of a new EU working directive.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 15% to EUR41.3m. This reflects an
additional 22 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this quarter compared to
September 30, 2006, offset by a revision of the residual value of the fleet to
reflect current market valuations and the positive impact on amortisation of the
stronger euro versus the US dollar.
Fuel costs rose by 19% to EUR202.3m due to a 30% increase in number of hours flown
offset by a 10% decrease in the average euro equivalent cost per gallon of fuel
hedged and a reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of winglets.
Maintenance costs increased by 35% to EUR14.3m, due to a combination of the
increase in the number of leased aircraft from 24 to 35, and the positive impact
of a stronger euro versus the US dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 6% to EUR6.2m due to the growth of
the airline and the increased commissions payable to airports arising from the
growth in baggage revenues.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 43% to EUR18.5m reflecting an additional 11
leased aircraft operating during the quarter compared to the same quarter last
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -5-
year.
Route charges rose by 31% to EUR65.8m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and an increase of 7% in the average sector length.
Airport and handling charges increased by 50% to EUR107.1m. This is higher than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of the doubling of costs
at Stansted Airport and higher charges at Dublin Airport, offset by lower costs
at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 17% to EUR34.1m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins fell by 1 point to 35% for to the reasons outlined above
whilst operating profits have increased by 22% to EUR304.0m during the quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by 33% to EUR21.4m for the quarter primarily due
to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period, offset somewhat
by a lower average cash balance.
Interest payable increased by 6% to 21.9m due to the drawdown of further debt
to part fund the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher
interest rates.

We confirm our responsibility for the half yearly financial statements and that
to the best of our knowledge:
* the condensed set of financial statements comprising the condensed income
statement, the condensed statement of recognised income and expense, the

     six months of the current financial year and that have materially affected
     the financial position or performance of the entity during that period; and
     any changes in the related party transactions described in the last annual
     report that could do so.
On behalf of the Board
David Bonderman                  Michael O'Leary

                     Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
                                      Notes
1. Reporting entity
    Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The
     condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the
     six months ended September 30, 2007 comprise the Company and its
     subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
    The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year
     ended March 31, 2007 are available at www.ryanair.com.
2. Statement of compliance
    These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
     interim financial statements") have been prepared in accordance with
     International Accounting Standards ("IAS") "Interim Financial Reporting" as
     endorsed by the European Union. They do not include all of the information
     required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in
     conjunction with the most recent published consolidated financial statements
     of the Group.
    The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2007 do not
     constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
     regulation 40 of the European Communities (companies, group accounts)
     regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March
     31, 2007 have been filed with the companies' office. The auditors' report on
     these financial statements was unqualified.
    The Audit Committee approved the interim financial statements for the half
     year ended September 30, 2007 on November 2, 2007.
3. Significant accounting policies
    Except as stated otherwise below, this quarter's financial information has
     been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the
     Group's most recent published consolidated financial statements, which were
     prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
     ("IFRS") as adopted by the EU.
4. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
    The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results (Operating and Financial
     Overview) for the half year ended September 30, 2007 and the comparative
     half year are based on the results reported under the Group's IFRS
     accounting policies.
5. Estimates
    The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
     judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
     accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
     income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -5-
    Except as described below, in preparing these consolidated financial
     statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the
     Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty
     were the same as those that applied in the most recent published
     consolidated financial statements.
    During the period ended September 30, 2007 management reassessed its
     estimates of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values following
     certain recent aircraft disposals and trends in the market.
6. Seasonality of operations
    The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
     quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the
     factors causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to
     general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.
     Accordingly the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and
     results.
7. Income tax expense
    The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
     six months ended September 30, 2007 was approximately 11.5 percent, in line
     with the same period last year.
8. Capital and reserves
    Share buy back programme.
    The Company commenced a share buy back programme in June 2007. To date 53.5m
     shares, at an approximate cost of EUR267m, have been purchased for

          30, 2007 and the related condensed consolidated interim statements of
         income, cash flows and recognised income and expense, for the six-month
         period then ended, and the related notes to the interim financial
         statements.
        We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly
         financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent
         misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the
         condensed set of financial statements.
        Directors' Responsibilities
         The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been
         approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing
         the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Transparency
         (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of
         the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator.
        As disclosed in note 3, the annual financial statements of the Company
         are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
         Standards, as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of
         financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has
         been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34,
         "Interim Financial Reporting", as adopted by the European Union.
        Our Responsibility
         Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the
         condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial
         report based on our review.
        Scope of Review
         We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on
         Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial
         Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued
         by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the UK and Ireland. A review
         of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -7-
         of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
         applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
         substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
         International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently
         does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
         significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly,
         we do not express an audit opinion.
        Conclusion
         Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
         believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the
         half-yearly financial report for the six months ended September 30, 2007
         is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
         International Accounting Standard 34, as adopted by the European Union
         and the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the
         Transparency Rules of the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator.

      cancellation. This represents approximately 3.5% of the pre existing share
     capital of the Company. The shareholder authority to complete the balance of
     the buy back of approximately EUR33m was extended by AGM on September 20, 2007
     for a period of one year.
9. Share based payments
    The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the
     most recent published consolidated financial statements. In June 2007 a
     further grant on similar terms was made to eligible employees, with a
     consequent charge to the income statement in the period of approximately
     EUR9.1m.
10. Contingencies
    The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
     business. The Group does not believe that any such litigation will
     individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial
     condition of the Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation
     actions, management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be
     determined but are not expected to materially adversely affect the Group's
     results of operations or financial position.
11. Capital commitments
    During the half year ended September 30, 2007 the Group announced the
     purchase of 27 additional Boeing 737-800s. This brings Ryanair's total firm
     orders for B737-800s to 308 and the total fleet size (net of planned
     disposals) to 262 by 2012. These additional aircraft are due for delivery in
     financial year ended March 31, 2010.
12. Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
    The following is the movement in available for sale financial assets in the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -6-
     six month period.
                                                                   EUR000

                                                                =======
    As of September 30, 2007 the average cost per share of Aer Lingus was EUR2.58
     and the market value was EUR2.35, a decline of 9% Accordingly the view at this
     time under accounting rules is that this is neither "significant" nor
     "prolonged" and therefore these is no impairment loss.
    However in the event that the asset becomes impaired the difference between
     the cost of the shares and the market value is recorded as an impairment
     loss in the profit and loss. At September 30, 2007 this amounted to EUR35.9m.
     The Group will review this matter at the end of each quarter.
13. Post balance sheet events
    Disposal of Aircraft
     In October 2007 the Group disposed of three Boeing 737-800 aircraft under
     its planned disposal programme. Agreements in relation to the forward sale
     of a further seventeen Boeing 737-800 aircraft have been signed. The group
     continue to market additional aircraft in line with its planned disposal of
     up to forty six aircraft.
14. Loans and borrowings
     The following is the movement in loans and borrowings (non-current and
     current) during the half year.

    The Group adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on April 1, 2007. The
     implementation of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Group's
     financial statements.
17. Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
    All revenues derive from the Group's principal activity and business segment
     as a low fares airline and includes scheduled services, car hire, internet
     income and related sales to third parties.
    Revenue is analysed by geographical area (by country of origin) as follows:

    All of the Group's operating profit arises from low fares airline-related
     activities, its only business segment. The major revenue earning assets of
     the Group are comprised of its aircraft fleet, which is registered in
     Ireland and therefore principally all profits accrue in Ireland. Since the
     Group's aircraft fleet is flexibly employed across its route network in
     Europe, there is no suitable basis of allocating such assets and related
     liabilities to geographical segments. Internet income comprises revenue
     generated from Ryanair.com, excluding internet car hire revenue, which is
     included under the heading car hire. Non-flight scheduled revenue arises
     from the sale of rail and bus tickets, hotel reservations and other revenues
     generated, including excess baggage charges, all directly attributable to
     the low fares business.
18. Property, plant and equipment
        Acquisitions and disposals
         During the six months ended September 30, 2007, the Group acquired
         assets with a cost of EUR329.9m (six months ended September 30, 2006:
         EUR88.7 million). There were no assets disposed of during the six month
         period.

                     Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
                         Operating and Financial Overview
Summary Half Year Ended September 30, 2007
Profit after tax increased by 24% to EUR407.6m, compared to EUR329.1m in the
previous half year ended September 30, 2006 reflecting a 20% increase in
passenger numbers, a 1% decrease in fares (including checked in baggage
revenues) and strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -4-
offset by a combination of higher fuel, airport and staff costs. Total operating
revenues increased by 24% to EUR1,554.3m, which was faster than the 20% growth in
passenger volumes, as average fares decreased by 1% and ancillary revenues grew
by 54% to EUR252.3m. Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 3%,
whilst Passenger Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 86% during the period.
Total operating expenses increased by 26% to EUR1,092.9m, due to the increased
level of activity, and the increased costs, associated with the growth of the
airline. Fuel, which represents 36% of total operating costs compared to 39%
last year, increased by 17% to EUR392.7m due to an increase in the number of hours
flown, offset by, a decrease in the US dollar cost per gallon, a positive
movement in the US dollar exchange rate versus the euro, and a reduction in fuel
consumption arising from the installation of winglets. Staff costs rose by 29%
reflecting the growth in the airline, a share option charge of EUR9.1m, and an
increase in cabin crew ratios. Excluding the charge of EUR9.1m for the share
option grant, staff costs would have increased by 21% Airport and Handling
charges increased by 50% to EUR208.9m arising from the doubling of airport charges
at Stansted and higher charges at Dublin Airport. As a result unit costs
increased by 5% and operating margins decreased by 1 point to 30%, whilst
operating profit increased by 20% to EUR461.4m.
Net Margins remained flat at 26% for the reasons outlined above.
Earnings per share increased by 25% to 26.61 cent for period.
Balance Sheet
Total costs decreased by EUR124.5m to EUR2,073.4m as the growth in profitability was
offset by the funding of a EUR253.1m share buy back programme, EUR57.0m increased
investment in Aer Lingus and EUR329.9m in capital expenditure largely from
internal resources. Total debt, net of repayments, increased during the period
by EUR36.2m. Shareholders' Equity at September 30, 2007 increased by EUR78.1m to
EUR2,617.8m, compared to March 31, 2007 due to the EUR407.6m increase in
profitability during the period and by EUR6.6m due to the exercise of share
options, offset by, EUR83.0m due to the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -4-
derivative financial assets, available for sale financial assets, stock options
and a share buy back of EUR253.1m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Half Year Ended September 30, 2007
Profit after tax, increased by 24% to EUR407.6m due to a 20% increase in passenger
numbers, a 1% decrease in fares (including checked in baggage revenues) and
strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was offset by a
combination of increased airport costs which rose by 50% to EUR208.9m arising from
the doubling of airport charges at Stansted, higher charges at Dublin Airport,
and increased staff costs, primarily due to higher cabin crewing ratios, which
rose by 29% by EUR146.3m. Operating margins, as a result, decreased by 1 point to
30%, which in turn resulted in operating profit increasing by 20% to EUR461.4m
compared to the previous half year ended September 30, 2006.
Total operating revenues increased by 24% to EUR1,554.3m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 20% to 26.6m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 3% due to
strong ancillary revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 20% to EUR1,302.0m reflecting a 1%
decrease in fares and a 20% increase in traffic due to increased passenger
numbers on existing routes and the successful launch of new routes and bases.
Load factor decreased by 1 point to 86% during the period due to a combination
of softer market conditions and a 21% increase in seat capacity.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
by 54% to EUR252.3m in the period. This performance reflects the strong growth in
onboard sales, excess baggage revenues, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other
ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 26% to EUR1,092.9m due to the increased level of
activity, and the increased costs associated with the growth of the airline,
particularly higher airport charges and staff costs. Total operating expenses
were also adversely impacted by a 7% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 29% to EUR146.3m. This primarily reflects a 29%
increase in average employee numbers to 4,875, the impact of pay increases
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -4-
granted during the period, and a EUR9.1m charge for a share option grant made to
eligible employees. Excluding the charge of EUR9.1m for the share option grant,
staff costs would have increased by 21%. Employee numbers rose due to the growth
of the business and an increase in cabin crewing ratios as a result of a new EU
working directive.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 6% to EUR76.1m. This reflects an
additional 22 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this period compared to
September 30, 2006, offset by a revision of the residual value of the fleet to
reflect current market valuations and the positive impact on amortisation of the
stronger euro versus the US dollar.
Fuel costs rose by 17% to EUR392.7m due to a 29% increase in the number of hours
flown offset by a 10% decrease in euro equivalent cost per gallon of fuel hedged
in addition to a reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of
winglets.
Maintenance costs increased by 26% to EUR26.9m, due to a combination of the
increase in the number of leased aircraft from 24 to 35, and the positive impact
of a stronger euro versus the US dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 25% to EUR14.5m due to a combination
of the growth of the airline, and the increased commissions payable to airports
arising from the growth in baggage revenues.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 45% to EUR36.7m reflecting an additional 11
leased aircraft operating during the period compared to the same period last
year.
Route charges rose by 31% to EUR129.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and a 7% increase in the average sector length.
Airport and handling charges increased by 50% to EUR208.9m, significantly higher
than the growth in passenger volumes, and reflects the impact of the doubling of
unit costs at Stansted Airport and higher charges at Dublin Airport, offset by
lower costs at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 18% to EUR61.8m, which is lower than the growth in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -4-
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 1 point to 30% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 20% to EUR461.4m during the
period.
Interest receivable has increased by 43% to EUR41.5m for the period primarily due
to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period, partially offset
by a lower average cash balance.
Interest payable increased by 9% to EUR44.9m due to the drawdown of debt to part
fund the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher interest
dates.
Foreign exchange gains during the period of EUR1.5m are primarily due to the
positive impact of changes in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in
profits during the period. The Company generated cash from operating activities
of EUR472.7m which part funded the EUR253.1m share buy back programme, EUR57.0m
increased investment in Aer Lingus, and capital expenditure incurred during the
period with the remaining balance reflected in Total Cash of EUR2,073.4m. Capital
expenditure amounted to EUR329.9m which largely consisted of advance aircraft
payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of eight aircraft and
two simulators. Long term debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR36.2m during
the period.
Shareholders' Equity at September 30, 2007 increased by EUR78.1m to EUR2,617.8m,
compared to March 31, 2007 due to the EUR407.6m increase in profitability during
the period, EUR6.6m arising from the exercise of share options, offset by EUR83.0m
reflecting the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivative financial
assets, available for sale financial assets, stock options and share buy back of
EUR253.1m.

           RYANAIR CALLS ON AER LINGUS TO REMOVE FUEL SURCHARGES BUT
           AER LINGUS GOUGES PASSENGERS WITH 30% FUEL SURCHARGE HIKE
                ONLY RYANAIR GUARANTEES NO FUEL SURCHARGES EVER
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Friday, 26th October 2007)
criticised Aer Lingus for raising its rip-off fuel surcharges today by 30% to
EUR65 per flight.
Ryanair's October 2006 offer for Aer Lingus guaranteed lower fares and the
removal of Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges. Since then Aer Lingus has done the
opposite by raising its already high fares and TWICE increasing its rip off fuel
surcharges.
Due to their hedging, Aer Lingus is buying its fuel for 2007 at nearly 20% below
the current market rate and today's 30% fuel surcharge increase is just another
Aer Lingus rip off. Only Ryanair guarantees no fuel surcharges ever. Only
Ryanair Holdings PLC Remove Fuel Surcharge
Ryanair guarantees the lowest fares.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said:
"Ryanair is the only airline to guarantee Irish passengers no fuel surcharges,
not today, not if oil goes above $100 a barrel, not ever. Aer Lingus is gouging
passengers with unjustified 30% fuel surcharge increases when it is getting its
fuel at a 20% discount to current market prices. Ryanair again calls on Aer
lingus to end its fuel surcharge scam.
"Passengers who want to avoid paying Aer Lingus' rip off fuel surcharges, should
book today on www.ryanair.com , where Ryanair has slashed 50% off its lowest
fares, with no fuel surcharges GUARANTEED for travel in November, December and
January".

                                 SHANNON - ALICANTE
                   DUBLIN - PALMA, SANTANDER AND ZADAR (Croatia)
    Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (Thursday, 25th October 2007)
     announced its 31st new route from Shannon to Alicante and three new routes
     from Dublin to Palma, Santander and Zadar (Croatia), all of which start in
     March 2008. This will bring the number of Ryanair routes from Dublin to 83,
     and from Shannon to 31. Ryanair will carry over 13 million passengers on 135
     Irish routes next year. No other airline carries as many passengers or
     offers as many routes to/from Ireland.
    Speaking in Limerick today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
        "Ryanair's low fares are delivering record growth for Irish Tourism on
         135 routes from 7 Irish airports. At a time when Aer Lingus is
         abandoning regional Irish airports and pulling routes such as Heathrow -
         Shannon and Poznan, Newcastle and Seville from Dublin, Ryanair will open
         18 new routes from Cork, Dublin, Kerry, Knock and Shannon in the next
         two months alone.
        "In two weeks time, Ryanair will open 8 new routes from Shannon,
         including its first domestic service from Shannon to Dublin. This new
         route will allow passengers from the mid-west to avoid the nightmare of
         traffic on the N7 and the M50, with 40 minute flights for less than the
Ryanair Holdings PLC 31st NEW ROUTE FROM SHANNON
         cost of a gallon of petrol. Ryanair's 31 Shannon routes will deliver two
         million passengers to Shannon in the coming year, generating a visitor
         spend of EUR350m and supporting 2,000 local jobs.
        "To celebrate the imminent launch of our Shannon Dublin service Ryanair
         is releasing 10,000 free seats* on its Shannon Dublin route for travel
         in November, December and January and we advise passengers to book now
         because these bargains will be snapped up in record time".
        *Just pay the taxes and charges

              5 DAYS UNTIL LOWEST FARE REVOLUTION COMES TO BELFAST
                         100,000 GBP5 SEATS TO CELEBRATE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 25th October 2007)
started the five day countdown to the launch of its Belfast base by releasing
100,000 seats for just GBP5, including taxes and charges, for travel in November,
December and January across all of its new routes from Belfast City to East
Midlands, Glasgow, Liverpool and London.
Ryanair's new routes from Belfast have attracted record advance bookings, with
100,000 seats already sold, confirming that passengers in Northern Ireland can't
get enough of our guaranteed lowest fares.
From 30th October, Ryanair will base a brand new $70m Boeing 737-800 aircraft at
Belfast City Airport and will guarantee the lowest fares from any Belfast
airport. If passengers find a lower fare on the same city routes with any other
Ryanair Holdings PLC LOWEST FARES FOR BELFAST
airline from any Belfast or Lough Neagh airport, Ryanair will pay out double the
difference, only Ryanair guarantees the lowest fares.
Speaking in Belfast today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
        "In just 5 day's time, Ryanair will revolutionise air travel to/from
         Belfast by guaranteeing the lowest fares from Belfast City or Lough
         Neagh airport. Over the next year, 600,000 passengers will fly with
         Ryanair to and from Belfast, saving GBP20 million compared to BMI and
         Easyjet's high fares, while generating a tourism spend of over GBP100m and
         sustaining 600 local jobs.
        "Passengers who haven't already joined Ryanair's lowest fare revolution
         can still do so during our five day countdown sale with 100,000 seats on
         offer for just GBP5 including taxes and charges. We urge all passengers to
         book straight away as demand for Northern Ireland's guaranteed lowest
         fares will be huge".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
19 October 2007
RYANAIR SUBMITS COMPLAINT TO IFSRA OVER AER LINGUS SHAREHOLDER BRIEFINGS TO
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT
Ryanair, Aer Lingus's largest shareholder today (Friday, 19th October 2007)
confirmed that it has submitted a formal complaint to the Irish Financial
Regulatory Services Authority (IFSRA) concerning the apparent breach by Aer
Lingus of Irish Company Law and Stock Exchange Rules in its selective briefings
to one shareholder (the Department of Transport) of market sensitive information
(the closure of the Shannon-Heathrow route) some 8 weeks prior to the
announcement of this decision to all shareholders through the Stock Exchange
notice.
Ryanair is gravely concerned that one shareholder (the Department of Transport)
which only holds a 25% interest in Aer Lingus was repeatedly briefed on this
market sensitive information by the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus on the 13th of
Ryanair Holdings PLC COMPLAINT TO IFSRA OVER AL
June; again by the Chairman of Aer Lingus on the 31 July; and again by both the
Chairman and Chief Executive of Aer Lingus of 3rd August - 4 days before the
Stock Exchange announcement of this route closure on 7 August 2007. This
repeated and selective dissemination of market sensitive information to one
shareholder up to 8 weeks prior to making all other shareholders aware of the
facts is a clear violation of Stock Exchange rules and Irish Company Law.
Ryanair has asked the FSA to investigate these selective briefings of one
shareholder, and these apparent breaches of Stock Exchange rules.
Commenting on today's complaint, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim
Callaghan said:
    "Aer Lingus's Chief Executive in an interview on RTE radio on 12 August
     claimed that all Aer Lingus shareholders were advised at the same time of
     this market sensitive information. This weeks' revelations prove that these
     claims were untrue. It is unlawful for any publicly owned company to engage
     in selective disclosure of market sensitive information to one shareholder
     regardless of how large that shareholder may be.
    "Since that shareholder (the Department of Transport) has no regulatory role
     either in the case of Irish airlines, or in route opening and closure
     decisions, Aer Lingus could only have been briefing the Department of
     Transport in its capacity as a 25% shareholder of Aer Lingus.
    "This appears to be a clear and flagrant breach of Stock Exchange rules by
     both the Chairman and Chief Executive of Aer Lingus and we have asked the
     FSA to investigate this matter and take appropriate action.. It is long past
     time that the Department of Transport stopped behaving as the downtown
     office of Aer Lingus, and that Aer Lingus stops treating the Department of
     Transport as its downtown head office."

             RYANAIR CALLS ON AER LINGUS TO REMOVE FUEL SURCHARGES
Ryanair, Ireland's 'no fuel surcharge' airline, today (Monday, 15th October
2007) renewed its call for Aer Lingus to remove its rip off fuel surcharges,
following newspaper reports that they intend to raise them AGAIN, by EUR5 to EUR55.
Ryanair's October 2006 offer for Aer Lingus guaranteed lower fares and the
removal of all Aer Lingus fuel surcharges. Aer Lingus has since increased its
already high fares and now looks set to increase its fuel surcharges for a
SECOND time since this bid lapsed. Is this what the Government meant when it
claimed that its 25% stake in Aer Lingus was there to protect consumers?
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair is the only airline in Europe to guarantee no fuel surcharges -
         not today, not tomorrow, not ever. According to weekend newspaper
         reports, Aer Lingus is intent on further increasing its unfair fuel
         surcharges despite Ryanair's calls for their removal. If the Government
         really cared about 'consumer interests', why is it not calling for the
         removal of Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges too?
Ryanair Holdings PLC REMOVE FUEL SURCHARGES
        "Passengers who want to avoid paying Aer Lingus' rip off fuel
         surcharges, can book today on www.ryanair.com , where Ryanair is
         offering millions of seats for just EUR6 including taxes with no fuel
         surcharges guaranteed for travel in October and November. While Aer
         Lingus is subjecting Irish consumers to higher fares and rip off fuel
         surcharges, Ryanair is the only airline to offer the guaranteed lowest
         fares and a no fuel surcharges ever guarantee".

        RYANAIR TO APPEAL COURT'S DECISION ON SLOTS AT CIAMPINO AIRPORT
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Friday, 12th October 2007)
condemned the failure of the regional court (TAR) in Rome to grant an injunction
to stop the Italian Government from unlawfully restricting the availability of
low fares in the Rome market, a move that provides further illegal protection of
Alitalia and restricts consumer choice. Ryanair will immediately appeal the
court's decision.
Since at least 2005, the Italian Government has been trying to reduce the
availability of low fares at Rome Ciampino. False claims were made by ENAC, the
Italian Aviation Authority about a night time noise issue at the airport despite
the fact that Ryanair operates the youngest and quietest aircraft at the airport
and does not operate any night time flights.
When it became clear that this bogus excuse for restricting growth at Ciampino
Ryanair Holdings PLC APPEAL CIAMPINO DECISION
would not stand up, the Italian Government fabricated a different claim,
ordering that the airport would have to be closed for at least 5 months for
'essential runway works', that capacity would be reduced by 30% in the interim
and that upon completion the airport would be closed to commercial traffic!
These claims are utter fabrication and Ryanair calls on the European Commission
to accelerate its investigation into this blatantly unlawful action by the
Italian Government.
Speaking today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
        "The TAR's failure to protect Italian consumers from this abuse of
         European and Italian law is very disappointing. The imposition of these
         bogus restrictions by the Italian Government will force Roman consumers
         to pay the higher fares charged by Alitalia, while causing significant
         damage to tourism in Rome. Ryanair will appeal this decision of the TAR
         Lazio but is calling on the European Commission to immediately put an
         end to the Italian Government's incessant protection of Alitalia.".

          RYANAIR TAKES FRANCE TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, has today (Wednesday, 10th October
2007) challenged a recent ruling by the French supreme court (Conseil d'Etat),
which sought to deny Ryanair's employees located in Marseille the right to rely
on Irish labour law in their relationship with Ryanair.
Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs and Company Secretary, Jim Callaghan, said:
        "The 2006 French Decree No 1425 was aimed at forcing Ryanair's pilots
         and cabin crew operating international routes to/from France to be
         subject to French labour law, irrespective of the fact that they are
         working on Irish registered aircraft and contracts. This was clearly in
         breach of French, European and international laws. Ryanair is committed
         to defending the rights of its employees, including the right of its
         employees operating on Irish territory to rely on Irish labour law, and
         has therefore challenged the legality of the Decree.
        "The French supreme court, which had earlier advised the French
         government on the legality of the Decree, was also the same body that
         rejected Ryanair's request to refer this matter to the European Court of
         Justice and then ruled that the Decree was lawful. This bizarre
         confusion of consultative and judicial functions within the French
         supreme court, as well as certain other aspects of the French procedure,
Ryanair Holdings PLC TAKES FRANCE TO EURO COURT
         denied Ryanair the right to fair trial and made it necessary for us to
         seek justice in the European Court of Human Rights.
        "Ryanair is confident that the European Court of Human Rights will
         correct the obvious injustice caused by the French judicial system and
         allow Ryanair's employees working on Irish aircraft and on Irish
         contracts to continue to enjoy Ryanair's industry leading pay and
         employment conditions under Irish law".

                Aer Lingus moves to force sale of Ryanair stake
Dublin & London, 10 October 2007: Aer Lingus today confirmed it is to take legal
proceedings to force Ryanair to dispose of its shareholding in Aer Lingus.
This follows confirmation by Philip Lowe, the E.U.'s Director General for
Competition, that the European Commission is to adopt a decision that the Merger
Regulation does not give it the legal authority to force the sale of Ryanair's
stake following its prohibition of Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus.
The Commission's decision will open the way for Aer Lingus to make an appeal to
the European Court of First Instance that would, if successful, enable the
Commission to order Ryanair to dispose of its stake in its main competitor. It
is Aer Lingus' view that the Regulation does give the Commission that power,
Aer Lingus Group PLC Ryanair Shareholding
since the stake was part of the original takeover attempt which the Commission
prohibited.
Aer Lingus' application to the Court of First Instance will be made in the
coming weeks.
Aer Lingus will also ask the Court, as a matter of urgency, to make an order to
prevent Ryanair from interfering in the running of Aer Lingus' business pending
judgment on the appeal.
Summarising the Aer Lingus position Mr John Sharman, Chairman said "We are fully
prepared to face competitive opposition on the runways and despite its attempts
to portray us otherwise, a strong, independent and competitive Aer Lingus is an
issue for Ryanair, particularly out of Dublin. Since this time last year,
Ryanair has pursued every available tactic to prevent the further development of
Aer Lingus as a competitive force, in order to defend its own patch out of
Dublin."
Mr Sharman concluded "Ryanair's reason for buying shares is to control Aer
Lingus via takeover. While the European Commission has rejected any takeover,
Ryanair has appealed against that decision and in the meantime has used its
shareholding to attempt to interfere with the commercial business of Aer Lingus
and to further its own interests. This confirms that the real and only purpose
of it holding the shares is its plan to obtain control over its main Irish
competitor. As the takeover has been barred, it follows that Ryanair's
shareholding, built up for the purpose of mounting a takeover, should also be
barred."

"Ryanair notes the European Commission's confirmation that it has properly
rejected Aer Lingus' request to force Ryanair to sell its stake in Aer Lingus on
the basis that Ryanair has no influence or control in Aer Lingus. Given that Aer
Lingus has twice rejected Ryanair's request for an EGM, it is impossible for Aer
Lingus to claim that Ryanair have any influence or control over them. We presume
this initiative was designed to cover Aer Lingus' embarrassment at a current
share price of EUR2.35, which is 20% less than Ryanair's offer of EUR2.80 almost 1
year ago".
"Sadly, Aer Lingus passengers continue to suffer higher fares and increased fuel
surcharges as a result of the EU Commission's prohibition of Ryanair's offer for
Aer Lingus, which guaranteed to deliver those passengers lower fares and to
remove fuel surcharges."

                          RYANAIR MOURNS DR. TONY RYAN
All of Ryanair's 4,800 people wish to extend their sincere and deepest
sympathies to the family and many friends of DR TONY RYAN who died this
afternoon, after a long illness.
Dr Ryan founded Ryanair 23 years ago. He persevered when all others lost faith.
His vision, leadership and ambition inspired Ryanair's growth to become the
world's biggest international passenger airline. He was, and will remain, an
inspiration to all of us.
It is rare that one man in his own lifetime can transform the lives of millions.
Dr Ryan did so by pioneering competition and low fare air travel in Europe.
Ryanair is proud to bear his name and his legacy. We will miss him greatly.
Dr Ryan and the Ryan family are in our thoughts and prayers at this time.
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR MOURNS DR TONY RYAN
    "Tony Ryan was one of the greatest Irishmen of the 20th Century. His many
     achievements in business, education, sport, the arts and heritage
     preservation leave an astonishing legacy to an extraordinary man. He was
     immensely supportive of, and took great pride in his family and their many
     successes. It was a privilege to work for him and to learn from him. I will
     miss his guidance, encouragement and friendship. We are all determined that
     Ryanair will continue to carry his name with pride and distinction".
Ryanair's Chairman, David Bonderman said:
    "It has been a pleasure and a privilege both to know and work with Tony
     Ryan. He possessed an extraordinary vision. Whether it was airline
     investments in Asia, vineyards in Europe or bloodstock in the U.S., he
     brought a tremendous sense of style, charm and good humour to all of his
     business and personal relationships. Ireland will be a poorer place for the
     loss of Tony Ryan".

Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 2nd October 2007)

October revolution, which will send high fares all over Europe tumbling to the
ground, includes new routes from Barcelona, Dublin, Dusseldorf, East Midlands,
Liverpool, Madrid, Pisa and Stockholm and the opening of two new bases in
Belfast and Valencia.
Welcoming the new routes, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "These 70 new routes will deliver Europe's lowest fares to over 5
         million additional passengers next year and will provide a massive boost
         to tourism across Europe. To celebrate this low fare revolution, fares
         on all of Ryanair's 550 European routes have been reduced to just
         EUR12.99, so we advise passengers to log onto www.ryanair.com immediately
         to snap up a bargain."

  RYANAIR CHALLENGES PERMISSION ON T2 AND THE REGULATOR'S DECISION ON AIRPORT
                                     CHARGES
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (27th September 2007) announced that
it has applied for a judicial review of An Bord Pleanala's decision upholding
planning permission for the DAA's EUR800m. second terminal (T2), and also the
Commission for Aviation Regulation's (CAR's) decision to allow the majority of
DAA's massively inflated costs for T2 to be recovered through higher passenger
charges. Both applications were filed with the High Court this afternoon.
Commenting on these two legal actions, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim
Callaghan, said:
    "Ryanair has long been an advocate of a low cost, efficient second terminal
     at Dublin Airport to cater for the growth of low fares traffic, which now
     accounts for the vast majority of traffic in Dublin Airport. Ryanair even
     offered to pay for and build such facilities over 5 years ago but was
     blocked by the Government, who preferred to allow the monopoly airport
     operator to build further gold plated, massively inefficient facilities at
     Dublin Airport.
Ryanair Holdings PLC CHALLENGE ON T2
    "These two applications for the High Court to judicially review the decision
     of An Bord Pleanala approving T2 and the CAR's decision allowing the DAA to
     recover the inflated costs of T2 are aimed at preventing further passenger
     charge increases and inefficiency at Dublin Airport. The DAA has a long
     history of providing inefficient, gold plated facilities (e.g., the new
     terminal in Cork, and Pier C and the original terminal extension in Dublin
     Airport) that do not meet the requirements of users and increase costs to
     airlines and their passengers.
    "The basis of both of these legal challenges is that the T2 facility as
     proposed by DAA is massively oversized, as CAR has now confirmed, it costs
     approximately 4 times what it should and will double passenger charges at
     Dublin Airport. Moreover, there is still time to allow DAA to provide
     facilities that meet the requirements of users but do not increase passenger
     charges further given that the existing facilities have enough capacity
     until 2011/2012.
    "If the DAA monopoly goes ahead with this ridiculous development, then the
     users of T2, i.e., Aer Lingus, should have to pay for it, not Ryanair's low
     fares passengers who will continue to use the old terminal".

 Chairman
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 Head Office
 Dublin Airport
 Co Dublin                                   26th September, 2007
Dear Mr Sharman,
We refer to your letter of 17 September which contains a second unlawful
rejection of a legitimate and legal request from a 10% plus shareholder of Aer
Lingus to hold an EGM to discuss the closure of the profitable Shannon-Heathrow
route. Your letter also makes a series of claims which are factually untrue and
legally untenable.
 1. The Directors of Aer Lingus do not have any discretion in this matter. Aer
     Lingus's Articles of Association and the Companies Act clearly oblige the
     Board of Aer Lingus to comply with any request from a shareholder owning 10%
     or more of Aer Lingus, to hold an EGM, at any time. The Board of Aer Lingus
     has no legal power to reject this request.
 2. This second unlawful rejection of a legitimate EGM request is a further
     breach of Irish company law by the Board of Aer Lingus. The Directors are in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Statement re: Aer Lingus
     continuing breach of their statutory duty and remain personally liable for
     this breach.
 3. Your claim that the holding of an EGM would infringe competition law is of
     course absurd. Aer Lingus will shortly call an EGM to approve your long-haul
     aircraft order. Ryanair will be perfectly entitled to attend and vote at
     this EGM without in any way compromising competition law. Indeed, to follow
     your ridiculous line of argument, you and your fellow directors of Aer
     Lingus would have already breached competition law by having permitted
     Ryanair to participate and vote at this year's AGM. Aer Lingus appears to
     invoke competition concerns only when it suits your purposes, regardless of
     how absurd or legally untenable these claims are.
 4. The fact that our proposed EGM motion would promote competition between
     Ryanair and Aer Lingus on the Shannon-London citypair removes any question
     or possibility of an infringement of competition law. Since Ryanair only
     owns 29.4% of Aer Lingus, we can easily be outvoted by other shareholders at
     any such EGM. Furthermore since Ryanair has never sought, nor seeks any
     agreement with Aer Lingus, the issue of competition law does not at any time
     arise.
 5. Your claim that "Aer Lingus will not engage in illegal conduct" is a false
     one, when your rejection of two separate legitimate requests for an EGM is
     in itself illegal conduct. Your unlawful refusal to allow shareholders to
     discuss the withdrawal of the profitable Shannon-Heathrow route at a time
     when the Company's interim profits have collapsed by 58% from EUR16m in 2006
     to just EUR6m in 2007 is inexplicable. Perhaps this rejection has more to do
     with Aer Lingus's desire to avoid any shareholder discussion of these
     lamentable interim results or this precipitous decline in profitability? The
     fact that Aer Lingus would have reported an interim loss, had it not been
     for the EUR9m increase in interest income (earned from the funds raised
     directly from shareholders at last September's IPO) highlights how awful Aer
     Lingus's trading has become. This collapse in profits has been accompanied
     by a similar collapse in your share price from over EUR3.00 to currently less
     than EUR2.40. Some of your own employees used their pension funds to acquire
     Aer Lingus shares at over EUR3.00 and are now suffering losses of over 20%. Do
     you feel no obligation towards your shareholders?
 6. Ryanair's criticisms of Aer Lingus's interim results is entirely valid and
     your attempt to avoid comment on this collapse in profitability is
     noteworthy. Since your rejection of Ryanair's offer of EUR2.80 per share last
     October, the Board and Management of Aer Lingus have presided over:
      + A 20% decline in Aer Lingus's share price from over EUR3 to under
         EUR2.40.
       + A 58% collapse in interim profits from EUR16m to just EUR6m.
       + An interim loss (if one excludes the additional interest income from
         shareholder receipts at last September's IPO).
       + A 7% decline in your cargo business which you previously claimed you
         had "re-energised".
       + A 12% increase in staff costs and a 6% increase in staff numbers when
         traffic only grew by 6%.
       + A 10% increase in airport charges when traffic only rose by 6%.
       + A 16% increase in Ground Ops costs when traffic only grew by 6%.
       + An astonishing EUR24m - four times Aer Lingus' interim profits - has
         been wasted to date defending Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer which was in any
         event doomed to failure since mid October last when the Government, the
         ESOT and other employee groups rejected it.
Aer Lingus's repeated refusal to hold a lawfully requested EGM (as required
under Section 132 of the Companies Act 1963) constitutes illegal and unlawful
conduct by the Board and Directors of Aer Lingus Group plc. This unlawful action
Ryanair Holdings PLC Statement re: Aer Lingus
shows clear oppression and disregard of the interests of Ryanair as a minority
shareholder in Aer Lingus. The fact that the Board and Directors of Aer Lingus
will go so far as to engage in unlawful activity and commit a breach of their
statutory and fiduciary duty conclusively demonstrates that Ryanair has no
control nor influence over the management and conduct of the business of Aer
Lingus.
We have referred this unlawful behaviour to our legal advisors and will consider
with them whether we should pursue our shareholder rights under the Companies
Act 1963 or through the Courts. In the interim we will continue to closely
monitor the actions of the Board and Management of Aer Lingus Group plc.
Yours sincerely

                  RYANAIR FULL YEAR GUIDANCE UNCHANGED AT AGM
                    1 MILLION FREE SEATS RELEASED IN OCTOBER
Ryanair, Europe's favourite international airline held its AGM in Dublin this
morning (20th September) and updated shareholders on current trading and recent
developments.
Commenting at the AGM, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
"Current trading continues to perform as expected, and advance bookings for the
Autumn are in line with our targets. We continue to believe that Winter yields
will be down by between -5% to -10%. Accordingly our full year guidance is
unchanged. We expect passenger volumes to grow by 18% to 50m passengers and
deliver profit growth of +10%, due to the softness in Winter yields, rising fuel
costs, and the doubling of passenger charges at London Stansted, Ryanair's
largest base.
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement
"We have received a second unlawful refusal from the Directors of Aer Lingus to
hold an EGM on Aer Lingus's decision to close its profitable Shannon-Heathrow
route. Ryanair regrets that Aer Lingus is refusing to allow shareholders an
opportunity to discuss the closure of a profitable route at a time when Aer
Lingus's interim profits have collapsed by 58% to just EUR6m and its share price
has fallen to EUR2.40, well below Ryanair's offer of EUR2.80 last year. Since the
Directors of Aer Lingus are willing to repeatedly breach their statutory
obligations towards their largest shareholder, there clearly isn't any influence
that Ryanair can bring to bear on this profitable route closure. Accordingly, we
are considering what legal remedies are available to us.
"Ryanair will further expand its Shannon base due to current strong forward
bookings. Ryanair's services will almost double on Shannon - London from 4 to 7
flights daily with services from Shannon to Gatwick, Luton and Stansted, where
Shannon passengers can connect to more destinations than they presently can from
Heathrow. Ryanair intends to double its Shannon-Paris services to a twice daily
flight next Summer, and Ryanair is now in negotiations with Amsterdam Schiphol
Airport to see if a viable cost base can be agreed to allow a low fare
Shannon-Amsterdam route to be launched. This Winter Ryanair will operate more
than 40 daily flights to/from Shannon, connecting Shannon to 30 European
destinations. If Aer Lingus is determined to abandon Shannon and the West of
Ireland then Ryanair will add more flights and more low fares.
"To demonstrate our ongoing commitment to low fares and our unique lowest fare
guarantee, Ryanair has today released 1 million free seats (passengers only pay
taxes, fees and charges) for travel in the month of October. These fares are

           MALTA NEEDS MORE LOW FARE ROUTES TO UNLOCK FULL POTENTIAL
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 19th September
2007) announced a new route from Malta to Venice Treviso, its 8th new route
since bringing low fares to Malta in October last year. Since then Ryanair has
delivered on its commitment to growth, generating a 12% increase in passengers
flying to / from Malta this summer. With the addition of today's route, Ryanair
will deliver 300,000 passengers to / from Malta over the next 12 months,
generating a visitor spend of EUR63m and supporting 300 local jobs.
Welcoming today's new route, Ryanair's Deputy CEO, Michael Cawley said:
       "Ryanair low fares have generated unprecedented growth for Malta and
        demonstrated that while others talk, we deliver. However, this growth is
        just touching the surface of what could be achieved by opening many more
        low fare routes. We hope the Maltese Government will now take the
        initiative and unlock the island's true tourism potential by supporting
        the rapid development of low fare routes for the benefit of the island,

                Board of Aer Lingus rejects Ryanair EGM request
The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc has today written to the Directors of Ryanair
Holdings plc rejecting a second request from Ryanair to convene an EGM, the aim
of which is to interfere with and frustrate the commercial and operational
performance of Ryanair's most resilient competitor.
The Board has received strong legal advice that the resolution proposed by
Ryanair is no different in substance from those previously rejected on the basis
that they would result in an infringement of Irish and EU competition law. This
latest request is not an isolated act and cannot be treated as separate from the
previous requisition request and from related public statements by Ryanair.
"The Board of Aer Lingus will act in accordance with the law and will not dance
to the tune of our competitor," said John Sharman, Chairman of Aer Lingus.
"We will continue to progress our stated business strategy in the interests of
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of EGM Request
our shareholders and will not be deflected by the self serving agenda of a
competitor with whom we fight tooth and nail for business every single day. The
Board's definitive decision is therefore to reject Ryanair's interference and
turn down the request to convene an EGM."
The full text of the letter rejecting the request is set out below.

BY HAND DELIVERY
Re:   Requisition of EGM
Dear Mr Callaghan,
I reply, on behalf of the Board of Aer Lingus, to your letter of 04 September.
Your letter of 04 September 2007 requisitioned an Extraordinary General Meeting
of Aer Lingus to consider, and if thought fit, pass the resolution set out in
that letter. I refer also to your letter to the Chairman of Aer Lingus of the
same date. Likewise, I refer to the previous correspondence between Aer Lingus
and Coinside Limited, another Ryanair company, relating to the Extraordinary
General Meeting requisitioned by Coinside Limited by letter of 13 August, as
well as the statement to the Stock Exchange on behalf of Ryanair Holdings plc of
14 August, Aer Lingus' letter to Coinside of 31 August 2007 refusing to convene
that meeting, Ryanair's letter to Aer Lingus of 31 August 2007 and our reply of
03 September, 2007.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of EGM Request
The Board has now considered and taken advice on the requisition of the 04
September, 2007 and decided to reject it. For the reasons set out in our letter
to Coinside Limited of 31 August, Aer Lingus is satisfied that the holding of
the EGM and the consideration of the resolutions as requisitioned by Coinside
Limited would have involved Aer Lingus and Ryanair in an infringement of Irish
and EC competition law.
It is the Board's view that the resolution which Ryanair now wishes to see
considered and passed at an EGM is little different in substance or effect from
the two resolutions earlier proposed by Coinside and rejected by Aer Lingus. As
you should be aware, both section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 (the "2002 Act")
and Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty prohibit agreements and concerted practices
between undertakings which prevent, restrict or distort competition and affect
State trade, or trade between Member States, as the case may be. Breach of these
provisions is a criminal offence in Ireland and may also give rise to civil
penalties. The Board is advised that incitement to commit a criminal offence,
attempting or conspiring to do so, or aiding and abetting a criminal offence,
are themselves criminal offences. Directors and shareholders are also exposed to
liability in respect of such breaches.
The effect of your resolution, if passed or implemented, would be that Ryanair,
Aer Lingus' principal competitor, will have caused or contributed to Aer Lingus
being directed to carry out its commercial activities in relation to the
Heathrow/Shannon routes in accordance with Ryanair's wishes, and contrary to the
policy already determined by the Board. Moreover, if Aer Lingus were directed,
at the instigation of its principal competitor, to remain on the Heathrow/
Shannon routes, that would inevitably affect the ability of Aer Lingus to
commence or maintain other routes, in particular Aer Lingus' proposed Belfast
services.
In that latter regard, as you are well aware, the limitation on the number of
slots held by Aer Lingus at Heathrow means that if the Shannon/Heathrow services
are retained, Aer Lingus' proposed services from Belfast would either have to
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of EGM Request
operate to a London airport other than Heathrow, or would have to use slots
currently used by Aer Lingus' services to Heathrow from Dublin or Cork. The
effect on competition of your proposed resolution is thus highly significant and
wide-ranging, quite apart from the fact that an agreement or concerted practice
to maintain the status quo on Aer Lingus' services to Shannon, would itself be
an infringement.
It is the Board's view that although your proposed resolution is no longer
accompanied by the second resolution proposed in Coinside's letter of 13 August,
it follows that the competitive effect is to all intents and purposes the same
and is not therefore "immune" as is suggested in your letter of 04 September.
In this regard we refer again to Mr O'Leary's statement of 14 August where he
said that maintaining the Shannon/Heathrow services "....need not come at the
expense of Belfast, since we believe that Aer Lingus can switch its recently
announced 4 times daily Dublin-Gatwick flights to Belfast. Competing from
Belfast to Gatwick against the relatively high fare EasyJet, will certainly be
more profitable for Aer Lingus than competing against the much lower fare
Ryanair on the Dublin-Gatwick route..... Alternatively Aer Lingus can still fly
four times daily from Belfast to Heathrow by switching one Dublin and one Cork
flight and taking back the two Heathrow slots which it presently leases out."
These matters plainly impinge significantly on competition between Aer Lingus
and Ryanair.
The Board takes the view that a discussion of the proposed resolution at an EGM
could not sensibly take place without the risk of disclosing or exchanging
commercially confidential information between competitors.
Moreover, in its statement to the Stock Exchange of 14 August, Ryanair has
already signalled what its intentions would be if Aer Lingus were to maintain
its Shannon/Heathrow services, namely that Ryanair would not introduce 3 new
flights from Shannon to London that it was otherwise proposing. Such signalling
is itself constitutive of a concerted practice if accepted or acted upon by Aer
Lingus.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of EGM Request
In these circumstances, the Board is advised that the holding of an EGM and the
consideration, passing or implementation of your proposed resolution would
plainly give rise to an agreement or concerted practice restricting or
distorting competition, contrary to Section 4 of the 2002 Act and Article 81(1)
of the EC Treaty. In addition both companies would have signalled their future
intentions, and commercially confidential matters between competitors would have
been disclosed or discussed, which is unlawful.
I am therefore instructed by the Board to inform you that it does not intend to
convene the EGM which you have purported to requisition. Aer Lingus will not be
a party to the concertation of activity or to the unlawful disclosure of
competitively sensitive information. Aer Lingus will not engage in such illegal
conduct, which would expose Aer Lingus and Ryanair and their directors to the
risk of both civil and criminal liability.
Finally, we completely reject the statements in your letter in relation to Aer
Lingus' interim results. The costs incurred by Aer Lingus in relation to the
Ryanair bid would have been entirely avoided if Ryanair had not chosen to make a
hostile bid for Aer Lingus which was doomed to failure on competition grounds,
as confirmed by the decision of the European Commission. Ryanair, by seeking
through Coinside, and again now directly, to requisition an EGM in clear breach
of competition law, continues to cause Aer Lingus to incur significant costs.
Yours sincerely,

                            Ryanair appeal will fail
Statement on behalf of Aer Lingus
10 September 2007
In June of this year, following an exhaustive investigation, the EU Commission
concluded that the proposed Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus presented greater
monopoly problems than any other airline case ever examined by the Commission.
The Commission's investigation, which took account of the interests of all
relevant parties, particularly those of consumers, confirmed the position of Aer
Lingus that competition and, as a result the Irish travelling public, would
suffer if a merger of the two largest airlines operating out of Dublin airport
was permitted to take place.
Consequently, Aer Lingus is in no doubt that the appeal announced today will
fail, and Aer Lingus will assist the Commission in upholding the decision before
Aer Lingus Group PLC Statement on Ryanair Appeal
the Court.
                                      ends
Notes to editor:
   Ryanair's assertion that the decision flies in the face of the
     Commission's previously expressed desire for consolidation in the European
     airline industry disregards the fact that the Commission has never favoured
     consolidation which leads to one airline dominating its home market in the
     way that Ryanair would dominate the Irish market were it to control Aer
     Lingus.
   Ryanair's position also ignores the practical reality that Irish consumers
     do not have the option of rail and road travel out of this country when
     travelling to mainland Europe.
   In contesting the Commission's position, Ryanair makes a false and
     misleading comparison between this case, which involved the proposed merger
     of two low cost carriers operating out of the same base, and the
     Commission's approval of the airline mergers such as the merger between Air
     France and KLM.  For instance:
      The number of passengers travelling annually on the routes where
        Ryanair and Aer Lingus overlap is 14 million, while in Air France/KLM
        the number was only 4 million.
      A merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus would cover 80% of all passengers at
        Dublin Airport, while Air France/KLM had only 62% at Paris CDG and 60% at
        Amsterdam Schiphol.
   Ryanair's argument that this merger only affects 5% of air transport in
     the EU is plainly misleading.  The European Commission protects competition
     on a route-by-route basis and a combined Ryanair/Aer Lingus entity would
     have dominated every single route operated by both Aer Lingus and Ryanair.

    RYANAIR APPEALS COMMISSION'S UNLAWFUL AND POLITICALLY MOTIVATED DECISION
                          PROHIBITING AER LINGUS MERGER
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Monday, 10th September 2007)
confirmed that it has submitted its appeal to the European Court of First
Instance (CFI) in Luxembourg against the EU Commission's unlawful and
politically motivated decision to prohibit its merger with Aer Lingus. Ryanair
had made an offer of EUR2.80 per share to acquire Aer Lingus following the former
national airline's floatation last October. Ryanair was required to seek
approval for clearance of the deal from the European Commission. However,
following an 8-month investigation, the Commission blocked the merger following
pressure from the Irish Government and Aer Lingus. As a result, Aer Lingus
shareholders have suffered a 58% collapse in their interim profits, and a share
price fall to EUR2.50.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Appeals EC decision
The merger between Ryanair and Aer Lingus would have:
 1. Immediately reduced Aer Lingus fares and eliminated Aer Lingus' unfair fuel
     surcharges, saving consumers over EUR100m. p.a.;
  2. Retained Aer Lingus as a separate brand and continued to operate the two
     airlines separately, thus giving passengers a choice of services;
  3. Retained all of Aer Lingus' profitable routes, including Shannon-Heathrow,
     which Aer Lingus subsequently abandoned;
  4. Reduced Aer Lingus' costs and improved its efficiency; and
  5. Improved Aer Lingus' service and punctuality.
Ryanair is confident that the CFI will overturn this decision because:
 1. This is the first airline merger that was actively opposed by a national
     Government (on narrow political grounds). The Irish Government has now
     admitted that they retained their "strategic" shareholding in Aer Lingus to
     block a hostile takeover "like Ryanair's bid".
  2. This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited a merger between
     two companies which combined will have less than 5% of the EU market.
  3. This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited an airline merger
     and reverses a 20-year policy of encouraging EU airline mergers, having
     previously approved the larger Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Austrian/Swiss
     mergers.
  4. This is the first time that an EU airline merger offered guaranteed fare
     reductions (and fuel surcharge elimination) of over EUR100m. p.a. for the
     benefit of European consumers.
  5. This prohibition leaves Aer Lingus exposed as a small, peripheral regional
     airline, which cannot compete with Ryanair on price or punctuality from
     Dublin (it has recently pulled off another 5 Ryanair routes from Dublin and
     also announced the closure of its Shannon-Heathrow route) at a time when the
     rest of the European industry is consolidating. Aer Lingus' recent interim
     results saw a 58% decline in Aer Lingus' profits, despite an average short
     haul fare of over EUR90 (more than double Ryanair's average fare of EUR41).
Speaking today in Dublin, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan,
said:
        "We have filed our appeal with the CFI today asking them to overturn the
         Commission's unlawful and politically motivated decision to block
         Ryanair's merger with Aer Lingus. This merger, which accounts for less
         than 5% of the EU air transport market, was clearly pro-competition and
         would have been the first merger in history to guarantee fare
         reductions, which would have saved European consumers more then EUR100m.
         p.a. The Commission made several manifest errors in its assessment of
         the merger and ignored evidence from Ryanair demonstrating the numerous
         benefits that the merger would bring to consumers and increased
         competition with the high fares Mega Carriers. At the same time, the
         Commission accepted, without question, misleading and factually
         inaccurate submissions from the Irish Government and Aer Lingus, both of
         whom were clearly trying to block the merger.
        "Ryanair also offered unprecedented commitments to the Commission to
         address any possible competition concerns, including giving up more than
         half of Aer Lingus' Dublin-Heathrow slots, as well as over 1,700
         additional weekly slots - several times what has been offered in any
         previous airline merger. However, the Commission refused these
         commitments, preferring instead to block this pro-consumer,
         pro-competition merger for narrow political reasons.
        "The Commission's prohibition of the merger has denied European
         consumers of these benefits and further protects the growing Mega
         Carriers like BA/Iberia/oneworld; Air France/KLM/Skyteam; and Lufthansa/
         SAS/bmi/Star Alliance from a stronger, more competitive Ryanair/Aer
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Appeals EC decision
         Lingus group. It has also seen Aer Lingus shareholders lose over EUR150m.
         as the share price has fallen to EUR2.50, considerably lower than
         Ryanair's offer last October.
        "We are confident that the CFI will overturn this decision in the
         interests of consumers and the competitiveness of the industry. As
         always with the European Commission, there seems to be one rule for the
         national Mega Carriers and a completely different one for Ryanair".

will operate a new four times daily service to London Stansted and a new 2nd
daily service from Belfast to Liverpool.

by British Midland and Easyjet on the people of Belfast. From October 30th,
passengers will save both money and time with Ryanair as they enjoy the lowest
fares and the best punctuality from Belfast's central airport. Ryanair
Ryanair Holdings PLC 23rd BASE AT BELFAST AIRPORT
guarantees the lowest fares from any Belfast airport to any London airport. If
passengers find a lower fare with any other airline, Ryanair will pay double the
difference. Only Ryanair GUARANTEES the lowest fares.

Speaking at Belfast City Airport today, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
        "We are delighted to announce Belfast City Airport as our 23rd European
         base. The airport approached us last week following the departure of the
         high fare Air Berlin and we are happy to step into the gap and deliver
         really low fares for Belfast. In the coming year, 600,000 passengers
         will fly Ryanair to and from Belfast for less than half the price of BMI
         and Easyjet's high fares. These visitors will generate a tourism spend
         of over GBP100m, which will sustain 600 local jobs.
        "Ulster has repeatedly said 'No' to high fares, well from 30th October
         next Ulster can say 'hello' to GBP10 fares with Ryanair. 100,000 free*
         seats are available on these new routes for immediate booking on
         www.ryanair.com (just GBP10 including taxes and charges) and we urge all
         passengers to book straight away as demand for Northern Ireland's lowest
         fares guaranteed will be huge".
Brian Ambrose, Chief Executive of George Best Belfast City Airport said:
        "I'm delighted to welcome this Ryanair base aircraft to Belfast City
         Airport and to announce that Ryanair will be offering flights to
         Stansted. This additional commitment to Belfast City Airport means we
         will offering more choice to passengers traveling to London.
         Additionally, we welcome Ryanair's intention to expand the European
         route portfolio from this base. Great news for the economy and tourism
         in Northern Ireland."

                 WORLD'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE LEAVES BA FAR BEHIND
                          RYANAIR CARRIES 55% MORE PASSENGERS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 5th September
2007) celebrated its busiest ever month, having carried over 4.8 million
passengers during August. Ryanair now carries 55% more passengers than BA.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair is the passengers' favourite, and last month we carried 55%
         more passengers than BA for a fraction of their high fares. The
         combination of British Airways' high fares, fuel surcharges and frequent
         delays has prompted British passengers to choose Ryanair in record
         numbers, leaving British Airways floundering as Ryanair flies high as
         the World's Favourite Airline.
        "To celebrate, Ryanair is giving away 6 million FREE* seats (just pay
         GBP10 taxes and charges), and we advise passengers to log onto
         www.ryanair.com immediately to snap up a bargain".

          Proposed resolutions would breach EU & Irish Competition Law
Dublin & London, 31 August, 2007: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or "the
Company"), an Irish low-cost, low-fares airline, providing both short-haul and
long-haul passenger transportation services, today announces that The Board of
Directors of Aer Lingus has this afternoon officially rejected a request by
minority shareholder, Coinside, on behalf of Ryanair, to convene an
extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of the Company. The full text of the letter
rejecting the request is set out below.
Coinside Ltd,
C/o Ryanair Head Office,
Dublin Airport,
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of EGM Request
Co. Dublin.
F.A.O. Mr Ken O'Toole
Director
Re: Notice of Requisition of Extraordinary General Meeting of Aer Lingus
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter of 13th August, 2007 requisitioning an Extraordinary
General Meeting ("EGM") of Aer Lingus to consider, and if thought fit to pass
the two resolutions set out in your letter. We also refer to the related
statement issued by Ryanair on 14th August, 2007 to the Irish Stock Exchange.
We have carefully considered your request, but for the reasons set out in detail
below we are not prepared to accede to it.
The context in which your request must be considered is of course the decision
by the European Commission of 27 June 2007 that the acquisition of control by
Ryanair of its closest competitor, Aer Lingus, would significantly impede
effective competition in the Common Market and therefore could not be permitted.
You are well aware that Aer Lingus and Ryanair are each others' closest
competitors on routes between Ireland and the UK which are the subject matter of
the resolutions you have sought.
In Ryanair's statement of 14th August 2007, Mr O'Leary, Chief Executive of
Ryanair, expressly identified the strategy that Ryanair would wish Aer Lingus to
pursue, namely to continue to fly from Shannon and to operate Belfast-Gatwick
routes instead of its recently announced Dublin-Gatwick route, on which Aer
Lingus competes with Ryanair, as well as Ryanair's own future commercial
strategy, in respect of a number of markets on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair
currently compete or potentially compete. Ryanair specifically comments in its
statement that "competing from Belfast to Gatwick against the relatively high
fare Easyjet, will certainly be more profitable for Aer Lingus than competing
against the much lower fare Ryanair on the Dublin-Gatwick route". Mr O'Leary
also stated Ryanair's wish in the alternative that Aer Lingus reduce frequency
on its London Heathrow routes from Dublin and Cork where it currently competes
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of EGM Request
with Ryanair.
In addition, Mr O'Leary stated that if Aer Lingus decided to continue with its
Shannon-Heathrow flights, then Ryanair would suspend its three additional daily
flights to London as "it would not make financial sense for Ryanair to add these
fights in circumstances where Aer Lingus continues to provide capacity for
330,000 passengers annually on the Shannon-London route".
You will be aware that Irish and European competition law prohibits all
agreements and concerted practices between undertakings that have as their
object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition. As
you will also be aware, an infringement of Irish and/or EC competition law gives
rise to a criminal offence under Irish law as well as exposing the company to
the threat of civil fines and damages.
It is clear that, in calling for an EGM to consider the two resolutions set out
in your letter, coupled with the content of the statements made by Ryanair to
the Stock Exchange, Ryanair is attempting to influence and co-ordinate the
strategic conduct of Aer Lingus, its closest competitor, in circumvention of the
Commission's recent prohibition decision and in clear breach of Irish and
European competition law.
In these circumstances and having received legal advice, it is clear that both
the holding of the EGM and the consideration of the proposed resolutions would
involve Aer Lingus and Ryanair in an infringement of Irish and EC competition
law, namely, Section 4(1) of the Competition Acts, 2002 and 2006 and Article 81
(1) of the EC Treaty, respectively.
Consequently, the directors of Aer Lingus reject the request as set out in your
letter of 13th August to convene an EGM and I am directed by the Board of Aer
Lingus to inform you that Aer Lingus will not be convening an EGM for these
purposes in any circumstances.
Yours faithfully.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
15 August 2007
                   RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 6 NEW ROUTES FROM DUBLIN
                    TWO NEW AIRCRAFT, INCREASED FREQUENCIES
                      AND 1 MILLION EXTRA PASSENGERS P.A.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 15 August 2007)
announced its intention to base two new aircraft at Dublin from November 2007
(making a total of 22 Dublin based aircraft), to launch 6 new European routes
and to increase frequencies on a further 12 routes to the UK and Europe, all of
which will deliver an extra 1 million passengers annually for tourism and the
Irish economy.
Ryanair will invest $140m in these two new Boeing 737-800 aircraft which will
deliver 1m extra passengers p.a. This will sustain an additional 1,000 new jobs
in North Dublin. It will bring Ryanair's total number of routes served year
round from Dublin to 81 - almost double the number served by Aer Lingus - and
Ryanair Holdings PLC 6 NEW ROUTES FROM DUBLIN
will next year see Ryanair deliver 10m passengers p.a. to/from Dublin Airport,
which is over 40% of Dublin's total traffic. These new aircraft and routes have
been facilitated by the recent opening of Check-in Area 14, and the opening of
Pier D in October. These facilities will provide the additional ramp capacity
needed to accommodate these new aircraft, new routes and new visitors to Dublin.
Announcing this further growth at Dublin Airport, Ryanair's Deputy CEO, Michael
Cawley said:
    "The events of this past week confirm that Aer Lingus cannot be trusted or
     relied upon to secure access to/from the Republic of Ireland on key routes
     to the UK and Europe. By launching these 6 new routes, 3 of which (Budapest,
     Nice and Prague) are already served by Aer Lingus, and 1 of which (Basel)
     competes with Aer Lingus's high fare route to Zurich, means that long-term
     access between Dublin and these cities has been secured, even if Aer Lingus
     decides to transfer more aircraft and more services North of the border to
     Belfast. Ryanair's new routes will end Aer Lingus's high fare monopoly on
     these routes and means that Irish passengers and visitors will no longer
     have to suffer EUR200 and EUR300 air fares from Dublin to Basel, Budapest, Nice
     and Prague. Our new routes to Katowice and Szczecin will provide new
     gateways and links between Ireland and Poland which have enjoyed such
     enormous customer support in recent years.
Dublin to:                     Starts:        Frequency:
 Basel                            Oct          3 x weekly
 Budapest                         Oct          Daily
 Katowice                         Nov          3 x weekly
 Nice                             Nov          Daily
 Prague                           Nov          Daily
 Szczecin                         Oct          2 x weekly
    "These new aircraft will enable Ryanair this Winter to significantly
     increase frequencies and services on 12 of Ryanair's existing routes at
     Dublin. There will now be extra daily flights from Dublin to Birmingham (4
     daily), Edinburgh (4 daily) and Manchester (5 daily) for time sensitive
     business passengers who are presently underserved by Aer Lingus. Bratislava,
     Kaunas, Krakow and Riga frequencies are increased to daily flights, as well
     as extra weekly flights to Bournemouth, Gkansk, Rzeszow, Tenerife and
     Wroclaw. Ryanair's combination of guaranteed lowest fares, best on-time
     performance, fewest lost bags, fewest cancelled flights continues to attract
     record passenger numbers and growth.
Dublin to:       Existing Frequency:              New Frequency:
 Birmingham       3 x daily                        4 x daily
 Bournemouth      7 x weekly                       9 x weekly
 Bratislava       4 x weekly                       Daily

 Manchester       4 x daily                        5 x daily
 Riga             4 x weekly                       Daily
 Rzeszow          2 x weekly                       3 x weekly
 Tenerife         4 x weekly                       5 x weekly
 Wroclaw          4 x weekly                       5 x weekly
    "With these new routes and additional flights, Ryanair expects to carry a
     record 10m passengers through Dublin Airport in 2008. The message today is
     clear, the people of Ireland can no longer trust Aer Lingus to provide
Ryanair Holdings PLC 6 NEW ROUTES FROM DUBLIN
     secure access to/from this country. Thankfully Ryanair can be relied on, not
     just to provide access, but to do so on brand new aircraft, with the lowest
     fares, the best passenger service, and a guarantee of no fuel surcharge.
    "To celebrate this substantial expansion of Ryanair's business at Dublin
     Airport, we are today releasing 1 million seats on our website at
     www.ryanair.com for EUR10 all in (including taxes and charges) for travel on
     flights from Dublin to Britain and Continental Europe from September to
     December. These seats will remain on sale until midnight Thursday 16 August,
     so I would urge everybody to snap them up before they are gone".

                         RYANAIR RESPONDS TO AER LINGUS
                       CLOSURE OF SHANNON-HEATHROW ROUTE
- THREE NEW LONDON FLIGHTS TO DELIVER 330,000 PAX P.A.
- REQUESTS AER LINGUS EGM TO RESTORE SHANNON-HEATHROW SERVICES
- OFFERS TO WITHDRAW EXTRA LONDON FLIGHTS IF AER LINGUS STAYS
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, held a press conference in Shannon Airport
this morning (Tuesday 14th August 2007) to announce that if Aer Lingus proceeds
with its plan to close the Shannon-Heathrow route and abandon 330,000 passengers
who currently use it, then Ryanair will provide 3 additional daily flights to
London to ensure Shannon Airport's capacity and traffic does not fall as a
result of this Aer Lingus closure.
The new flights include: - A fourth daily flight to London Stansted.
- A second daily flight to London Gatwick.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RESPONSE TO AL CLOSURE
- A daily flight to London Luton.
Ryanair's London services will increase from 4 to 7 flights daily, providing
Shannon passengers with daily connections to 3 London airports including Gatwick
and Stansted, which offer more destinations and connections to Europe than
London Heathrow does presently.

Ryanair also announced that it had written yesterday to Aer Lingus requesting
that an EGM of Aer Lingus be called, to allow Aer Lingus shareholders the
opportunity to exercise their statutory right to consider requesting the Board
and Management of Aer Lingus to reverse the Shannon closure decision and
maintain Aer Lingus's 4 daily flights between Shannon and Heathrow. Aer Lingus
have confirmed that its Shannon-Heathrow route is profitable and Ryanair
believes that by reducing its costs in Shannon Aer Lingus's profits can be
further increased in the interests of all Aer Lingus shareholders.
Ryanair has in its letter suggested that Aer Lingus consider using the recently
announced 4 daily Dublin-Gatwick flights as a suitable alternative for its new
Belfast base. This would allow Aer Lingus to operate Aldergrove Belfast - London
Gatwick 4 times daily, while retaining Shannon-Heathrow 4 times daily services.
Alternatively Aer Lingus could operate 4 daily flights from Belfast to Heathrow
using 2 of Aer Lingus's existing Heathrow slots which are currently used for
flights to Dublin and Cork, as well as the 2 Heathrow slots which are leased out
to other airlines.
Ryanair confirmed that - if so requested by the Government - it would be willing
to vote its 25% shareholding in favour of the motion to retain Aer Lingus's
existing profitable Shannon-Heathrow services. Alternatively the Government
could ask Ryanair to abstain from voting, which would give the Government and
Ryanair Holdings PLC RESPONSE TO AL CLOSURE
the ESOT a majority at the EGM and allow them to save Shannon's Heathrow
services. On its own, Ryanair's 25% stake will be insufficient to influence this
decision. The trade unions, who between them own almost 20% of Aer Lingus, have
already indicated that they would vote in favour of retaining Aer Lingus's
Shannon-Heathrow services. Therefore all that is needed to save Aer Lingus's
current Shannon-Heathrow services is for Bertie Ahern's Government (acting as a
25% shareholder) to lift a finger and vote in favour of the motion at the EGM.
Speaking today in Shannon, Ryanair's, Michael O'Leary said:
    "As Shannon's largest airline, Ryanair is determined to ensure that Shannon
     and the Mid-West region will suffer no loss of traffic or flights as a
     result of Aer Lingus's decision to abandon Shannon in favour of Belfast.
     These 3 new Shannon-London flights which will connect Shannon to Stansted,
     Gatwick and Luton, will replace Aer Lingus's existing Heathrow capacity and
     will ensure that an additional 330,000 passengers annually will travel
     between Shannon and London should Aer Lingus proceed to abandon Shannon. If
     Aer Lingus cancels its Shannon-Heathrow flights, then it is inevitable that
     the Shannon transatlantic flights will also transfer to Belfast Aldergrove
     in the not too distant future. The Government and Aer Lingus's determination
     to invest in Belfast should not come at Shannon's expense. We believe that
     our proposals will enable Aer Lingus's Shannon-Heathrow services to
     continue, while also allowing Aer Lingus to serve Belfast-London 4 times
     daily.
    "Aer Lingus's rules confirm that any 10% shareholder can ask for an EGM to
     be called. It is surprising that neither the Government nor the trade
     unions, both of whom own over 10% have taken up Ryanair's previous offer to
     work together or called for an EGM to be held. Accordingly and in the
     interests of retaining a profitable route for the benefit of all Aer Lingus
     shareholders, Ryanair has asked Aer Lingus to call an EGM and we will be
     asking the trade unions and Bertie Ahern's Government to support this motion
     calling for Shannon's 4 daily flights to Heathrow to be maintained. This
     need not come at the expense of Belfast, since we believe that Aer Lingus
     can switch its recently announced 4 times daily Dublin-Gatwick flights to
     Belfast. Competing from Belfast to Gatwick against the relatively high fare
     Easyjet, will certainly be more profitable for Aer Lingus than competing
     against the much lower fare Ryanair on the Dublin-Gatwick route. These moves
     will we believe deliver superior profits and returns for Aer Lingus
     shareholders and should therefore be endorsed by the management and
     shareholders of Aer Lingus. Alternatively Aer Lingus can still fly four
     times daily from Belfast to Heathrow by switching one Dublin and one Cork
     flight and taking back the two Heathrow slots which it presently leases out.
    "Since Ryanair remains committed to working closely with the Shannon Airport
     Authority to help them grow and develop Shannon, we have confirmed to the
     Chairman of Shannon Airport, that these 3 additional daily flights to London
     will be suspended should Aer Lingus decide to maintain its existing 4 daily
     flights operation between Shannon and Heathrow. It would not make financial
     sense for Ryanair to add these flights in circumstances where Aer Lingus
     continues to provide capacity for 330,000 passengers annually on the
     Shannon-London route".
Ryanair stated that a solution to this Shannon crisis is now firmly in Bertie
Ahern's court. Ryanair wrote to him over one week ago offering to work with the
Ryanair Holdings PLC RESPONSE TO AL CLOSURE
Government to preserve the Shannon-Heathrow route. Despite this crisis in
Shannon, Bertie Ahern has ignored Ryanair's letter. Bertie Ahern's Government
cannot ignore this EGM motion. If the Government, acting as a 25% shareholder in
Aer Lingus, simply vote in favour of maintaining the profitable Shannon-Heathrow
services, then these can and will continue without affecting any of Aer Lingus's
recently announced Belfast-London flights. If Bertie Ahern fails to support this
motion, then the extent to which his Government has lied, and abandoned Shannon
in favour of Belfast will become apparent to all. In those circumstances,
Ryanair will add these 3 extra daily flights to ensure that Shannon suffers no
loss of flights or traffic as a result of Aer Lingus abandoning the
Shannon-London route.

         numbers to 1.5m annually, sustaining 1,500 local jobs.

        RYANAIR SUPPORTS UK COMPETITION COMMISSION INVESTIGATION OF BAA
                AND CALLS FOR URGENT BREAK UP OF THE BAA MONOPOLY
Ryanair, Britain's largest passenger airline, today ( Thursday, 9th August 2007)
welcomed the UK Competition Commission's Issues Statement on their investigation
of the BAA airports monopoly. The CC rightly identifies as serious issues the
following:
O The abysmal delays being experienced by passengers going through security and
immigration at BAA airports
O The effects of common ownership on the development cost and operation of the
London Airports , and
O The impact of the regulatory regime on airport development.
Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs and Company Secretary, Jim Callaghan, said:
"The Competition Commission has now identified the various issues where the
Ryanair Holdings PLC CALL FOR BREAK UP
ongoing common ownership by the BAA of the main London airports is damaging the
development and operation of these airports and is damaging to the travelling
public. The BAA needs to be broken up urgently in the best interests of British
consumers, visitors to the UK and airline users.
"The situation has now reached crisis levels. BAA have doubled passenger charges
in Stansted airport and passenger numbers have fallen for the first time since
Ryanair began operating to Stansted in 1991. As a result, routes have been
cancelled and frequencies reduced. Passenger queues at security and immigration
have also reached crisis levels with passengers being forced to wait in excess
of one hour. BAA also continue to waste money and ignore the needs of users by
building inefficient, gold plated airport facilities at Stansted Airport, which
will lead to another doubling of passenger charges and a further reduction in
passenger numbers and routes from London.
"We are therefore calling on the Competition Commission to expedite its
investigation of the BAA and to force a break up of this abusive monopoly as
soon as possible in the interest of consumers. It is clear that the situation
will continue to deteriorate until competition is introduced in the London
airports market."

    RYANAIR ANNOUNCES BIGGEST EVER SKI PROGRAMME FLY TO THE SLOPES FOR FREE*
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 8th August 2007)
unveiled its biggest ever ski programme. With 58 direct routes from the UK to
European ski airports, Ryanair is leading the way to the mountains, with more
choice than any other airline.
Millions of skiers and boarders are set to benefit from the guaranteed lowest
fares to the slopes, as Ryanair unveiled a vast range of ski flights direct from
London, Glasgow, Liverpool, East Midlands, Bristol, Bournemouth, Newcastle,
Blackpool and Doncaster.
Announcing the record-breaking ski season, Ryanair's Head of Sales & Marketing,
Sinead Finn remarked;
"Ryanair offers the most choice and the lowest fares to the slopes. Each year,
skiers flock to Ryanair due to our guaranteed lowest fares and the convenience
Ryanair Holdings PLC BIGGEST EVER SKI PROGRAMME
of our airports.
"With flights from all over the UK to ski gateways such as Grenoble, Salzburg,
Friedrichshafen, Turin, Milan and Barcelona, it's never been easier to go skiing
or snowboarding.
"Our gateway airports are convenient and situated for easy access to the resorts
that skiers want to go to. Getting to famous French resorts such as Val D'Isere,
Meribel and Courcheval is so simple from Grenoble. And Friedrichshafen offers
the fastest access to Swiss and Austrian mega-resorts like Davos, Klosters and
St Anton."
"We recognise the unprecedented demand for ski flights from the UK, which is why
we've got more destinations served from more UK airports than ever before."
"To celebrate Ryanair's biggest ever ski season, we've made our ski flights
available for free*. But fares this low are certain to go fast, so we'd urge
skiers and boarders looking for the cheapest way to the pistes to book straight
away."
Full details of this winter schedule are available at www.ryanair.com.

         RYANAIR APPLIES FOR INJUNCTION AGAINST LATEST UNLAWFUL ATTEMPT
                   BY ENAC TO BLOCK LOW FARES AND COMPETITION
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (8th August) announced that
it has applied to the regional administrative court in Lazio for an immediate
injunction to overturn the recent unlawful attempt by ENAC (the Italian Civil
Aviation Authority) to restrict capacity at Rome Ciampino Airport by almost 30%
from November 2007. In so doing the Italian Authorities are again trying to
support the terminally ill Alitalia by blocking low fares and competition in
Rome. Ryanair has also submitted a complaint to the European Commission asking
it to immediately intervene on behalf of consumers to prohibit this unlawful
reduction of capacity at Rome's secondary airport.
For the past year ENAC has been trying by various unlawful means to restrict the
low fares and choice offered by airlines at Rome Ciampino as follows:
Ryanair Holdings PLC INJUNCTION AGAINST ENAC
   False claims about a night time noise issue at the airport, despite the
     fact Ryanair, which uses the quietest and youngest aircraft in Ciampino,
     does not operate any night time flights at Ciampino. All of Ryanair's
     repeated requests for a detailed noise study at Rome Ciampino Airport to
     expose the truth of this matter have been ignored. Such a study would have
     proved conclusively that noise problems at Rome Ciampino are being caused by
     military aircraft operating at night and have nothing to do with the
     commercial movements of airlines like Ryanair or Easyjet.
    In May last year ENAC imposed an unlawful PSO monopoly between Rome and
     Alghero forcing Ryanair to stop offering low fares and choice on this route.
     Again, there were no grounds for this blatant attempt to protect Alitalia
     and the European Commission has now instructed the Italian Government to
     reverse this unlawful decision.
    Now ENAC has issued an order that capacity at Rome Ciampino airport is to
     be reduced by 30% to just 100 movements per day from November. They have
     also ordered that the airport must close for at least 5 months for
     unsubstantiated 'essential' runway works and that commercial flights should
     not return to Ciampino upon completion. There is no evidence that there is
     any problem with the runway in Ciampino. Airlines were not consulted about
     ENAC's claimed need to undertake these runway works. Furthermore ENAC have
     made no attempt to explain why commercial flights should be not be allowed
     to return to Ciampino upon completion of these works.
Speaking today in Rome, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"This latest unlawful attempt by the Italian Authorities to restrict capacity
and block low fares at Rome Ciampino airport is bad for Italian consumers/
visitors. If Ryanair and the other low fare airlines using Rome Ciampino are
removed unlawfully by ENAC, Italian consumers/visitors will be forced to pay
Alitalia's rapaciously high fares and fuel surcharges while tourism in Rome will
suffer irreparable damage.
"We have asked the Lazio Court for an injunction to stop this unlawful reduction
in capacity at Ciampino so that Ryanair can continue to operate on its existing
network of routes this summer and to offer new services. Without this injunction
the following routes would have to be terminated: Rome to Madrid; Rome to
Saragoza and flights to Glasgow and Madrid would have to be drastically reduced.
Ryanair would also be prevented from re-launching the Rome to Alghero route - a
route it was forced to terminate due to an unlawful PSO imposed by ENAC. Ryanair
has also called on the European Commission to intervene immediately on behalf of
Italian consumers/visitors who should not be denied flights or forced to pay
higher fares because of these unlawful efforts to provide further illegal state
support to Alitalia".

    RYANAIR GUARANTEES NO PRICE FIXING, NO FUEL SURCHARGES, JUST THE LOWEST
                                  FARES...ALWAYS
    Releases 2.7m tickets for just GBP10* to mark BA's GBP270m price fixing fine
Ryanair, Britain's largest airline today (Friday, 3rd August 2007) called on
both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic to immediately remove their unnecessary
and unjustified fuel surcharges. Ryanair, which this year will carry over 50m
passengers is the only airline to guarantee its passenger will not now or ever
levy a fuel surcharge. Ryanair is also the only airline in Britain to guarantee
the lowest fares. On every route which Ryanair operates, passengers can obtain a
double the difference refund if they can find a lower fare for any similar
itinerary, with any competitor airline. To date very few claims have been made
under this guarantee, because Ryanair almost always offers the lowest fares,
with a guarantee of no fuel surcharges and a guarantee of no price fixing
either.
Ryanair Holdings PLC GUARANTEED NO PRICE FIXING
Speaking at this morning's press conference, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary
said:
    "There is only one way that British passengers and visitors can guarantee
     that they are getting the lowest fare, guarantee that they won't suffer a
     fuel surcharge and guarantee that they won't be subject to price fixing and
     that is to book with Ryanair, Britain's favourite airline.
    "To mark a week when British Airways and Virgin Atlantic admitted to price
     fixing and overcharging passengers, Ryanair is releasing 2.7m seats for
     travel through September, October and November this year at an all inclusive
     price of just GBP10* one way. This GBP10* fare includes all taxes, fees and
     charges, with a guarantee of no price fixing and no fuel surcharges either.
     The fuel surcharges levied by British Airways, Virgin Atlantic are just
     their latest price fixing scam. The flag carrier airlines have been price
     fixing for years, which is why they regularly apply for and obtain
     anti-trust immunity from both the US and European authorities.
    "Ryanair's fares are significantly lower than BA's and yet we guarantee no
     fuel surcharges. If we can do it, then there is no justification for BA's
     fuel surcharges, which are just a hidden fare increase which should be
     included in BA's fares. Passengers have no choice in avoiding these unfair
     fuel surcharges which are just another rip off of the travelling public by
     British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and others.
    "This week's revelations that BA was engaged in price fixing, as well as
     losing thousands of passengers bags proves yet again that passengers who
     want a fair fare should fly with Ryanair, the only airline that delivers the
     lowest fares, the best punctuality, the youngest fleet of aircraft, with a
     guarantee of no price fixing and no fuel surcharges either".
These 2.7m GBP10* fares will sell out quickly, so passengers who want to avail of
them should book this week at www.ryanair.com.
*Terms and conditions apply

                   RYANAIR GUARANTEES NO FUEL SURCHARGES EVER
                    AS BA IS FINED GBP121M FOR FUEL LEVY HIKES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 1st August 2007)
renewed its guarantee of 'no fuel surcharges ever' after British Airways was
fined GBP121.5m by the UK Office of Fair Trading for inflating fuel surcharges in
conjunction with other airlines.
Ryanair is the only airline to guarantee that it will never apply a fuel
surcharge, and British Airways' fuel surcharge of GBP43 is over 40% more expensive
than Ryanair's average fare of GBP30.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "As the OFT has confirmed, BA has been ripping off passengers for years
         by price fixing and working with other airlines to inflate fuel
         surcharges. Since BA first introduced its fuel surcharge in 2004, the
         price of oil has doubled, yet BA has increased its fuel surcharges
         seventeen-fold to GBP43 per one-way flight.
        "Ryanair is the only airline with a 'no fuel surcharge ever' guarantee,
Ryanair Holdings PLC GUARANTEED NO FUEL SURCHARGE
         so passengers who want to avoid the fuel surcharging scams should log
         onto www.ryanair.com immediately, where fares currently start from just
         GBP10".

      in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) IAS 34
     Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all of the information
     required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in
     conjunction with the most recent published consolidated financial statements
     of the Group.
    The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     quarter ended June 30, 2007 on July 27, 2007.
2. Significant accounting policies
    Except as stated otherwise below, this quarter's financial information has
     been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in
     Ryanair's most recent published consolidated financial statements, which
     were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
     ("IFRS") as endorsed by the EU.
3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
    The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the quarter ended June
     30, 2007 and the comparative year are based on the results reported under
     the group's IFRS accounting policies.
4. Estimates
    The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
     judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
     accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
     income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
    Except as described below, in preparing these consolidated financial
     statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the
     Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty
     were the same as those that applied in the most recent published
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
     consolidated financial statements.
    During the quarter ended June 30, 2007 management reassessed its estimates
     of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values following certain
     recent aircraft disposals.
5. Seasonality of operations
    The Company's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter
     to quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the
     factors causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to
     general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.
     Accordingly the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and
     results.
6. Income tax expense
    The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
     three months ended June 30, 2007 was approximately 11 percent, in line with
     the same period last year.
7. Capital and reserves
    Share buy back programme.
     During the last two months we completed a share buy back of 37.6m shares at
     a cost of approx. EUR187m. This share buy back represents 2.5% of the
     pre-existing issued share capital of the company. The shareholder authority
     for such a buy back expires at AGM on September 20, 2007.
8. Share based payments
    The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the
     most recent published consolidated financial statements. In June 2007 a
     further grant on similar terms was made to eligible employees, with a
     consequent charge to the income statement in the quarter of approximately
     EUR7.0m.
9. Contingencies
    The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
     business. Management does not believe that any such litigation will
     individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial
     condition of the Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation
     actions, management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be
     determined but are not expected to materially adversely affect the Group's
     results of operations or financial position.
    Capital commitments
     During the quarter ended June 30, 2007 the Group announced the purchase of
     27 more Boeing 737-800s. This brings Ryanair's total firm orders for
     B737-800s to 308 and the total fleet size (including planned disposals) to
     262 by 2012. These additional aircraft are due for delivery in financial
     year ending March 31, 2010.
10. Post balance sheet events
    Aer Lingus Appeal
     Ryanair is in the process of preparing an appeal to the European Court of
     First instance against a decision by the European Commission prohibiting its
     proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus, following the partial floatation of the
     Irish flag carrier airline. In October 2006, Ryanair notified the European
     Commission that it had acquired 19.16% of the ordinary share capital in Aer
     Lingus (this was subsequently increased to 25.2%). Ryanair offered remedies
     to the Commission in the first phase of the Commission's merger
     investigation, something that has not been done in other previous airline
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
     mergers-including Air France/KLM. Despite demonstrating that the merger of
     these two airlines would have significant consumer benefits and
     efficiencies, and despite offering substantial remedies - including
     guaranteed fare and fuel levy reductions/eliminations, and large numbers of
     slot surrenders - the Commission nevertheless prohibited the merger in June
     2007. Ryanair has two months from the date of decision to submit an appeal.
11. Loans and borrowings
    The following is the movement in loans and borrowings (non-current and
     current) during the quarter.

                                      -------
12. Fin 48 "Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes" (US GAAP)
        The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on April 1, 2007. The
         implementation of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company's
         financial
         statements.

                      RYANAIR ANNOUNCES RECORD Q1 PROFITS
               PROFITS RISE 20% TO EUR139M - TRAFFIC GROWS BY 18%.
Ryanair, Europe's largest international airline, today (31 July) announced
record first quarter profits of EUR139m, a 20% increase over last year. Traffic
grew by 18% to 12.6m passengers and revenues rose by 22% to EUR693m. Unit costs
increased by 5% mainly due to higher fuel, staff, and airport costs. Despite
these higher costs, Ryanair maintained an industry leading after tax margin of
20%.

 Basic EPS(EuroCents)            7.50                8.98            20%
Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
"These record Q1 profits reflect an 18% growth in passenger volumes, flat
yields, and strong growth in ancillaries. Ancillary Revenues grew by 53% to
EUR117.1m, due to improved penetration of car hire, hotels, travel insurance,
onboard sales and excess baggage revenues. Ancillaries account for 17% of total
revenues and we expect this will rise to 20% over the next 3 years.
Unit costs rose by 5% due primarily to the doubling of airport charges at
Stansted and higher charges at Dublin airport. Staff costs rose by 34% to EUR75.9m
due to volume growth and increased cabin crewing ratios. We continue to focus
aggressively on costs and anticipate that unit costs for the remainder of the
year will grow by 5%, somewhat lower than the 6% to 7% previously guided.
We continue to oppose the BAA airport monopoly's plans to waste GBP4bn on building
a second runway and terminal at Stansted. BAA Stansted doubling of airport
charges since April 07 have caused traffic declines at Stansted for the first
time in 15 years. The current service provided by the BAA at Stansted is nothing
short of appalling. Many of the 17 security machines are regularly unmanned
during peak morning periods, and understaffing at passport control continues to
cause long queues and frequent passenger delays. We continue to press for the
break up of the BAA airport monopoly which provides abject facilities, a third
rate service and charges extortionate prices, particularly at Stansted. This
winter we will sit 7 of our 40 Stansted based aircraft on the ground because
Stansted's higher airport charges make it more profitable to ground these
aircraft during the winter rather than fly them.
We remain opposed to the DAA's plans to build an EUR800m second terminal in
Dublin, a cost which has escalated four fold over the past 18 months. This
terminal has now been identified by the regulator as being the wrong size. It is
also in the wrong location, and grossly overpriced. We have called upon the
Aviation Regulator to ensure that only those airlines who use T2 will pay for
it. Ryanair passengers cannot be expected to pay higher charges to cross
subsidise a second terminal they do not want and will never use. The DAA have
spent almost EUR50m on consultants reports over the past year, and now plan to
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
waste "about EUR450m" on extending/refurbishing Terminal One, while at the same
time reducing its capacity by 40% from 25m passengers to just 15m passengers.
The proposed expenditure at Dublin is out of control and sadly the Irish
aviation regulator continues to do nothing to restrain this waste or to protect
airport users.
We intend to appeal the EU Commissions recent decision (to prohibit our offer
for Aer Lingus) to the European Court of First Instance. We are confident that
this decision will be overturned because this is the first ever prohibition
between two companies which combined will have less than 5% of the EU market.
The EU Commission has for the last 20 years been encouraging EU airlines to
merge, and they have already approved much larger mergers such as Air France/KLM
and Lufthansa/Swiss. We look forward to the European court overturning this
unprecedented, and we believe nakedly political decision.
We will continue to grow over the winter period, however, due to the softness in
yields, and the doubling of both UK APD and costs at Stansted, we plan to reduce
the number of aircraft operated ex Stansted this winter by almost 20% from 40 to
33. This will mean reduced frequency or temporary cessation of services on
routes which would be loss making due to Stansted's higher airport charges.
Consequently passenger volumes this winter will now grow at a slower rate (by
18% to 50m) than the 24% to 52m previously guided. These capacity reductions
should bring more stability to yields, whilst, at the same time, reducing
operating costs and eliminating losses on these non profitable winter routes at
Stansted.
Our outlook remains cautious for the fiscal year due to the softness of traffic
and yields. Although we have little visibility beyond the next 2 months we
expect this weaker demand to continue. We anticipate that yields in Q2 will be
slightly down, and winter (H2) yields be down by as much as -5% to -10% compared
to last year. However, the reduction in capacity on non profitable winter
routes, and the significant airport cost savings this cut back will generate,
will enable us to slightly increase our previous guidance. We now expect that
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
Net Profit will increase by (+10%) for the fiscal year compared to (+5%)
previously guided, although, we caution that this guidance will be heavily
dependent upon the accuracy of our forecast decline in yields for the second
half of the year.
During the last two months we undertook a series of share buy backs amounting to
a total of 37.6m shares at a cost of approx. EUR187m. This share buy back
represents 2.5% of the pre-existing issued share capital of the company. The
shareholder authority for such a buy back expires at AGM on September 20th,
2007.
Ends.

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is
subject to important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially. It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the many
factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an
airline operating in the European economy. Among the factors that are subject to
change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are the airline
pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers,
market prices for the replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental,
safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union ("EU")
and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in
currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general
economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general
willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political
factors.

                 Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Quarter ended June 30, 2007
Profit after tax increased by 20% to EUR138.9m, compared to EUR115.7m in the quarter
ended June 30, 2006. These results reflect an 18% increase in passenger numbers,
flat fares (including checked in baggage revenues) and very strong growth in
ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was offset by a combination of
increased airport costs which rose by 50% to EUR101.8m arising from the doubling
of airport charges at Stansted and higher charges at Dublin Airport and a one

off step up in staff costs, due to higher cabin crewing ratios, which rose by
34% to EUR75.9m. Total operating revenues increased by 22% to EUR693.0m, which was
faster than the 18% growth in passenger volumes, as average fares remained flat
and ancillary revenues grew by 53% to EUR117.1m. Total revenue per passenger as a
result increased by 4%, whilst Passenger Load Factor decreased by 2 points to
82% during the quarter.
Total operating expenses increased by 25% to EUR535.5m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, associated with the growth of the airline.
Fuel, which represents 36% of total operating costs compared to 39% last year,
increased by 14% to EUR190.4m due to a decrease in the US dollar cost per gallon,
a positive movement in the US dollar exchange rate versus the euro and a
reduction in fuel consumption arising from the installation of winglets. Staff
costs rose by 34% reflecting an increase in cabin crewing ratios and Airport and
Handling charges increased by 50% to EUR101.8m arising from the doubling of
airport charges at Stansted and higher charges at Dublin Airport. As a result
unit costs increased by 5% and operating margins decreased by 1 point to 23%,
whilst operating profit increased by 15% to EUR157.5m.
Net Margins remained flat at 20% for the reasons outlined above.
Earnings per share have increased by 19.7% to 8.98 cent for the quarter.
Balance Sheet
The strong growth in profitability continues to positively impact the balance
sheet with Total Cash increasing by EUR91.3m to EUR2,289.3m despite funding a EUR40m
share buy-back programme and an additional EUR96.6m in capital expenditure largely
from internal resources. Total debt net of repayments decreased during the
quarter by EUR23.2m. Shareholders' Equity at June 30, 2007 increased by EUR94.3m to
EUR2,634.1m, compared to March 31, 2007 due to the EUR138.9m increase in
profitability during the quarter, the EUR2.9m exercise of share options and a
further EUR7.5m arising from the impact of the IFRS accounting treatment for
derivative financial assets, pensions and stock options offset by the share
buyback of EUR40m.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended June 30, 2007
Profit after tax, increased by 20% to EUR138.9m due to an 18% increase in
passenger numbers, flat fares (including checked in baggage revenues) and strong
growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was offset by a combination
of increased airport costs which rose by 50% to EUR101.8m arising from the
doubling of airport charges at Stansted and higher charges at Dublin Airport and
a one off step up in staff costs, due to higher cabin crewing ratios, which rose
by 34% to EUR75.9m. Operating margins, as a result, decreased by 1 point to 23%,
which in turn resulted in operating profit increasing by 15% to EUR157.5m compared
to quarter ended June 30, 2006.
Total operating revenues increased by 22% to EUR693.0m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 18% to 12.6m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 4% due to
strong ancillary revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 18% to EUR575.9m due to an 18% increase
in traffic reflecting increased passenger numbers on existing routes and the
successful launch of our new routes and bases. During the quarter average fares
(including checked baggage revenues) were flat reflecting the soft yield
environment. Load factor decreased by 2 points to 82% during the quarter due to
a combination of softer market conditions and the 21% increase in seat capacity.
Ancillary revenues continue to grow faster than passenger volumes with revenues
increasing by 53% to EUR117.1m in the quarter. This performance reflects the
strong growth in on board sales, excess baggage revenues, non-flight scheduled
revenues, and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 25% to EUR535.5m due to the increased level of
activity, and the increased costs associated with the growth of the airline
particularly higher airport charges and staff costs. Total operating expenses
were also adversely impacted by a 6% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 34% to EUR75.9m. This primarily reflects a 29%
increase in average employee numbers to 4,726, the impact of pay increases
granted during the quarter and a EUR7m charge for a share option grant made to
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
eligible employees. Employee numbers rose due to an increase in cabin crewing
ratios as a result of a new EU working directive. Pilots, who earn higher than
the average salary, accounted for 34% of the increase in employees whilst cabin
crew accounted for 56% of the increase during the quarter.
Depreciation and amortisation decreased by 2% to EUR34.8m. This reflects the
addition of 16 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this quarter compared to
June 30, 2006, offset by a revision in the residual value of our fleet to
reflect current market valuations and the positive impact on amortisation of the
stronger euro versus the US dollar.
Fuel costs rose by 14% to EUR190.4m due to a 29% increase in the number of hours
flown offset by a 10% decrease in the average US dollar cost per gallon of fuel
hedged and the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro versus the US
dollar in addition to a reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of
winglets on our entire Boeing 737-800 fleet.
Maintenance costs increased by 18% to EUR12.6m, due to a combination of the
increase in the number of leased aircraft from 21 to 35, and the positive impact
of the strengthening of the euro versus the US dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 45% to EUR8.3m due to the growth of
the airline and the number of routes operated which rose by 54% to 441 at the
quarter end and the number of bases which increased by 4 to 20.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 47% to EUR18.2m reflecting an additional 14
leased aircraft operating during the quarter compared to the same period last
year.
Route charges rose by 31% to EUR63.2m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and an increase of 6% in the average sector length.
Airport and handling charges increased by 50% to EUR101.8m. This is higher than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of the doubling of costs
at Stansted Airport and higher charges at Dublin Airport, offset by lower costs
at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 20% to EUR30.3m, which is lower than the growth in
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 1 point to 23% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 15% to EUR157.5m during the
quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by 56% to EUR20.1m for the quarter due to a
combination of higher levels of cash on hand and increases in average deposit
rates earned in the quarter.
Interest payable increased by 11% to EUR22.9m due to the drawdown of further debt
to part fund the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher
interest rates.
Foreign exchange gains during the quarter of EUR1.4m are primarily due to the
positive impact of changes in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in
profits during the quarter. The Company generated cash from operating activities
of EUR248.3m which part funded our EUR40m share buy back programme and capital
expenditure incurred during the quarter with the balance reflected in Total Cash
of EUR2,289.3m. Capital expenditure amounted to EUR96.6m which largely consisted of
advance aircraft payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of one
aircraft. Long term debt, net of repayments, decreased by EUR23.2m during the
quarter.
Shareholders' Equity at June 30, 2007 increased by EUR94.3m to EUR2,634.1m, compared
to March 31, 2007 due to the EUR138.9m increase in profitability during the
quarter, the EUR2.9m exercise of share options and a further EUR7.5m arising from
the impact of the IFRS accounting treatment for derivative financial assets,
pensions and stock options offset by the share buyback of EUR40m.

Body
The announcement of the Interim Management Statement released yesterday under
PRNUK-1907071737-D00A contained an error in the Managers Comments. The first
sentence of the second paragraph should have referred to the Company
outperforming the indices and to NAV growth of 9.2% and not 24.3%. The
corrected announcement is set out in full below.
                                                                   19 July 2007
GARTMORE IRISH GROWTH FUND PLC
INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT (UNAUDITED)
This interim management statement covers the period from 1 April 2007 to 30
June 2007. It has been produced for the sole purpose of providing information
to the Company's shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the UK
Listing Authority's Disclosure and Transparency Rules. It should not be relied
upon for any other purpose.
Investment Objective
The Company seeks to provide shareholders with long-term capital growth through
investment in quoted companies which are either incorporated in the Republic of
Gartmore Irish Correction : Interim Management Statement
Ireland or Northern Ireland or, if elsewhere, derive the majority of their
turnover or profits from the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.
Manager's Comments
Net asset value per Ordinary share fell by 5.5% to 960.0p per share in the
quarter to 30 June. Whilst there is no formal benchmark, this compares with
falls of 1.5% for the Davy Mid-Cap Index, 1.5% for the broad-based ISEQ Index
and 1.3% for the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies (ex Investment Companies),
whilst the FTSE All-Share Index rose 3.7%.
Although the Company outperformed the indices in the first quarter of calendar
year 2007, with NAV growth of 9.2%, performance suffered in the second quarter
from its holding in Ryanair. Following a period of strong growth in the first
quarter of the year, the low cost airline suffered its biggest share price
decline since 2004. Increased competition and significantly higher passenger
taxes and charges are having a negative impact on sales demand, especially in
the UK. The Company also suffered from not holding Elan, whose share price
increased by 68% during the second quarter.
One of the best performers in the portfolio during the period has been CRH, the
world's second biggest building materials supplier. European construction
markets are continuing to recover and cement demand is strong across most of
CRH's markets. We continue to favour ICON as we believe that the company's
large number of compounds in pre-clinical studies set to progress to human
trials underpins a positive medium-term outlook. During April, the company
reported strong quarterly results and raised its revenue guidance for 2007 and
its shares responded very positively.
Key stock changes included reducing Allied Irish Bank. As part of our strategy
we have sold out of financials generally as loan demand is falling away, and we
increased our holding in CRH, which is now the largest holding, and exited from
Ryanair during the quarter.
We remain confident of the vigour of the Irish economy. However, we note that
Euroland interest rates have increased twice in the quarter. This move together
Gartmore Irish Correction : Interim Management Statement
with rising long-bond yields could slow economic growth and reduce the
viability of venture-capital-backed bids. The portfolio is well-placed to
perform well in equity markets where volatility has risen somewhat. We
anticipate that our bottom-up stock selection will enable us to continue to
identify a significant number of promising investment opportunities and to
deliver attractive returns as and when markets bounce.
Material Events and Transactions
Over the three months to 30 June 2007 the Company repurchased and placed into
Treasury 105,000 Ordinary shares at a price of 910p per share excluding
expenses (a discount to net asset value of 6.1%). Subsequent to the period
under review, the Company repurchased and placed into Treasury 108,000 Ordinary
shares on 6 July 2007 and 75,000 Ordinary shares on 19 July 2007 at prices of
895p and 885p per share, respectively, excluding expenses (representing a
discount to net asset value of 7.5% and 6.6% respectively). The Company will
continue, as and when appropriate, to exercise its powers to buy back shares
with the objective of reducing the share price discount to NAV whilst enhancing
the NAV per share.

              RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 11 NEW ROUTES FROM 7 EUROPEAN BASES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 19th July 2007)
announced 11 new routes from its bases in Barcelona, Bremen, Brussels, Dublin,
London, Marseille and Milan which go on sale today on www.ryanair.com.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said;
        "These 11 new routes bring the Ryanair network to 499 routes across 26
         countries and mark the reinstatement of low fare flights between France
         and Morocco following the French Government's refusal in December to
         proceed, as other European countries did, with the prompt application of
         the already agreed EU Morocco open-skies agreement.
        "In the coming year over 50m passengers will enjoy Ryanair's lowest
         fares and no fuel surcharge guarantee, saving EUR5bn compared to the high
         fares and fuel surcharges of Air France, Alitalia, BA, Iberia and
         Lufthansa".
    NEW ROUTES

GARTMORE IRISH GROWTH FUND PLC
INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT (UNAUDITED)
This interim management statement covers the period from 1 April 2007 to 30
June 2007. It has been produced for the sole purpose of providing information
to the Company's shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the UK
Listing Authority's Disclosure and Transparency Rules. It should not be relied
upon for any other purpose.
Investment Objective
The Company seeks to provide shareholders with long-term capital growth through
investment in quoted companies which are either incorporated in the Republic of
Ireland or Northern Ireland or, if elsewhere, derive the majority of their
turnover or profits from the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.
Manager's Comments
Net asset value per Ordinary share fell by 5.5% to 960.0p per share in the
quarter to 30 June. Whilst there is no formal benchmark, this compares with
Gartmore Irish Interim Management Statement
falls of 1.5% for the Davy Mid-Cap Index, 1.5% for the broad-based ISEQ Index
and 1.3% for the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies (ex Investment Companies),
whilst the FTSE All-Share Index rose 3.7%.
Although the Company outperformed most of the indices in the first quarter of
calendar year 2007, with NAV growth of 24.3%, performance suffered in the
second quarter from its holding in Ryanair. Following a period of strong growth
in the first quarter of the year, the low cost airline suffered its biggest
share price decline since 2004. Increased competition and significantly higher
passenger taxes and charges are having a negative impact on sales demand,
especially in the UK. The Company also suffered from not holding Elan, whose
share price increased by 68% during the second quarter.
One of the best performers in the portfolio during the period has been CRH, the
world's second biggest building materials supplier. European construction
markets are continuing to recover and cement demand is strong across most of
CRH's markets. We continue to favour ICON as we believe that the company's
large number of compounds in pre-clinical studies set to progress to human
trials underpins a positive medium-term outlook. During April, the company
reported strong quarterly results and raised its revenue guidance for 2007 and
its shares responded very positively.
Key stock changes included reducing Allied Irish Bank. As part of our strategy
we have sold out of financials generally as loan demand is falling away, and we
increased our holding in CRH, which is now the largest holding, and exited from
Ryanair during the quarter.
We remain confident of the vigour of the Irish economy. However, we note that
Euroland interest rates have increased twice in the quarter. This move together
with rising long-bond yields could slow economic growth and reduce the
viability of venture-capital-backed bids. The portfolio is well-placed to
perform well in equity markets where volatility has risen somewhat. We
anticipate that our bottom-up stock selection will enable us to continue to
identify a significant number of promising investment opportunities and to
Gartmore Irish Interim Management Statement
deliver attractive returns as and when markets bounce.
Material Events and Transactions
Over the three months to 30 June 2007 the Company repurchased and placed into
Treasury 105,000 Ordinary shares at a price of 910p per share excluding
expenses (a discount to net asset value of 6.1%). Subsequent to the period
under review, the Company repurchased and placed into Treasury 108,000 Ordinary
shares on 6 July 2007 and 75,000 Ordinary shares on 19 July 2007 at prices of
895p and 885p per share, respectively, excluding expenses (representing a
discount to net asset value of 7.5% and 6.6% respectively). The Company will
continue, as and when appropriate, to exercise its powers to buy back shares
with the objective of reducing the share price discount to NAV whilst enhancing
the NAV per share.

         PUNCTUALITY STATS CONFIRM RYANAIR IS NUMBER 1 AGAIN AND AGAIN
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 17th July 2007)
released its punctuality statistics for the first half of 2007, which confirm
that Ryanair is Europe's number one on-time airline, while Easyjet lags far
behind.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Peter Sherrard, said:
        "The travelling public has made Ryanair Europe's number one low fares
         airline because only Ryanair guarantees the lowest fares and best
         punctuality. Easyjet can't compete with Ryanair - they're far more
         likely to delay you and will charge you 50% more in the process.
        "Of course if you like higher fares and delays fly Easyjet, but
         passengers who want Europe's best punctuality and the lowest fares
         guaranteed should log onto www.ryanair.com immediately, where fares
         start from just GBP10".

                RYANAIR RESPONDS TO EU COMMISSION INVESTIGATION
               INTO BERLIN, DORTMUND, LUBECK AND TAMPERE AIRPORTS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 10th July 2007)
condemned the European Commission ,which announced investigations into Easyjet's
cost base at Berlin and Dortmund airports, and Ryanair's costs base at Lubeck
and Tampere airports, while at the same time continuing to ignore the blatant
State Aid being doled out to Europe's largest flag carriers including Air
France, Alitalia, Lufthansa and Olympic.
Ryanair pointed to the European Commission's repeated failure to investigate
massive State Aid as follows:
 1. Air France enjoys a 50% discount on airport charges for domestic routes at
      French airports which amounts to unlawful State Aid of over EUR1bn over the
      last 7 years.
 2. Lufthansa's exclusive use of the second terminal at Munich Airport which
      caused the State owned Munich Airport to lose over EUR50m last year. These
      enormous losses being made by the State owned airport for the sole and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Response to EU Investigation
      exclusive benefit of Lufthansa prove conclusively that Lufthansa is not
      paying the full charges associated with the second terminal at Munich.
 3. The European Commission has repeatedly ignored the billions of euro of State
      aid which are handed annually to Alitalia in the form of rescue and recovery
     plans.
 4. The European Commission continues to ignore the annual bail out of the loss
      making Olympic Airlines by the Greek Government.
Commenting today Ryanair's Spokesman, Peter Sherrard said:
    "Today's announcement proves that the European Commission has a biased
     approach to State Aid investigations. It continues to ignore EURbillions of
     State Aid to flag carrier airlines in the form of discounted domestic
     charges, exclusive use of terminal facilities and annual bail outs to
     Alitalia and Olympic Airlines, yet at the same time the Commission is
     wasting time and resources investigating the cost base of small secondary
     airports such as Lubeck and Tampere, which without Ryanair would have no
     traffic at all, or the main airports of secondary cities such as Berlin and
     Dortmund, which would have far smaller traffic numbers were it not for the
     services provided by Easyjet.
    "This latest development is further proof that this European Commission has
     given up on deregulating the European Air Travel market, and is intent on
     re-regulating that market at every hands turn. At a time when many of
     Europe's flag carrier airlines are raising fares and levying fuel
     surcharges, Ryanair calls on the Commission to launch investigations of
     these massive State Aid subventions to Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia and
     Olympic Airlines, instead of wasting time investigating the affairs of
     smaller secondary regional airports who are and should be free to continue
     to discount their charges in order to win new business from low fare
     airlines.
    "What's next from this European Commission? Perhaps they will investigate
     McDonalds for negotiating discounts with beef and cheese suppliers? Perhaps
     they will investigate Ikea for negotiating volume discounts with furniture
     suppliers? Who knows perhaps they will investigate Tesco for using its
     purchasing power to negotiate supplier discounts on behalf of its customers.
    "Low fares airlines negotiate substantial discounts over the high published
     charges at many airports in secondary cities and secondary airports,
     precisely because those airports wish to develop new routes, traffic and
     business. This development has created competition to the high fare flag
     carrier airlines who are using their political power and influence to send
     the European Commission off on wild goose chases, whilst ignoring the real
     State Aid scandals which are the massive subventions which continue to be
     given annually to flag carrier airlines like Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia
     and Olympic.
    "This Commission is not interested in competition, it simply wants to
     protect the flag carrier airlines and penalise the low fares airlines who
     are negotiating discounts at secondary airports and passing on those
     discounts to the travelling public in the form of lower fares.
    "It is noteworthy that this latest investigation comes just two weeks after
     the EU Commission blocked Ryanair's takeover of Aer Lingus, when it had
     previously rubber stamped the much larger Air France takeover of KLM and the
     Lufthansa takeover of Swiss and Austrian. Clearly this Commission applies
     one rule to the flag carrier airlines and an entirely different rule to the
     low fares airlines. Sadly this Commission cannot be trusted to advance the
     cause of consumers, it is more interested in protecting the narrow self
     interest of flag carrier airlines".

involving Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia and Olympic Airways, which were
submitted to the Commission over a year ago. These complaints involved hundreds
of millions of Euro in illegal state aids being granted by the French, German,
Italian and Greek Governments to subsidise their flag carrier airlines. Although
Ryanair has called on the Commission several times to investigate these claims,
the Commission has failed to do so.
Confirming that Ryanair is in the process of submitting a complaint against the
Commission to the European Courts, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim
Ryanair Holdings PLC EC failure to investigate
Callaghan, said:
    "This is another example of the Commission's twin track approach to state
     aid. On one hand they refuse to take action against serious violations of
     the state aid rules by national Governments to protect their flag carrier
     airlines like Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia and Olympic, while at the same
     time they launch bogus investigations against small regional and secondary
     airports like Charleroi. The foolishness of the Commission's Charleroi
     decision is that Ryanair now actually has a lower cost base in Charleroi.
    "The Commission has failed to take any action against the following blatant
     abuses of the state aid rules:
   The French Government's discounting of domestic airport fees, which
     amounts to an illegal state aid to Air France of approximately EUR1bln. over
     the past 7 years. Meanwhile, the Commission is pursuing tiny Malta for a
     similar discounting of its domestic airport charges.
   The German Government has allowed state owned Munich Airport to rack up
     losses of over EUR50m. p.a. on a new terminal built exclusively for Lufthansa.
     These losses are a massive subsidy to Lufthansa, the only occupant of this
     terminal. Meanwhile, the Commission is going after small regional and
     secondary airports like Charleroi that are offering competitive deals to
     airlines, like Ryanair, who are prepared to deliver huge traffic growth to
     these otherwise underutilised airports.
   The Italian and Greek Governments have repeatedly given massive
     injections of state aid into their terminally ill flag carrier airlines,
     Alitalia and Olympic. The Commission has rubberstamped multi-billion bailout
     packages for Alitalia and the Italian Government is currently planning to
     write off hundreds of millions in losses at the national airline in order to
     make it attractive for sale. Meanwhile, the European Commission blocked
     Ryanair from taking over the small, loss making regional Irish airline, Aer
     Lingus. Moreover, the Greek Government has never repaid the multi-millions
     in illegal state aid granted to Olympic.
    "It appears as always that the Commission applies one rule for the high fare
     flag carrier airlines and state owned primary airports, but a different one
     for low cost airlines like Ryanair and the numerous regional and secondary
     airports that are offering competition and lower fares to the travelling
     public. The European Commission is more concerned with protecting
     inefficient flag carrier airlines and hub airports than it is with actually
     promoting competition and the consumer interest.
    "Ryanair is left with no alternative but to challenge the Commission's
     failure to investigate these unlawful state aid abuses in the European
     Courts. Ryanair is confident that the European Court will take the
     Commission to task for their failure to fairly enforce the state aid rules
     against national Governments who continue to protect their inefficient flag
     carrier airlines.
    "It is time that the European Commission stops this twin track approach to
     enforcing the state aid rules. The same rules should be fairly applied to
     all airlines, and an end put to the unlawful state aid to the flag
     carriers".

Ryanair today (Wednesday, 4th July 2007) welcomed the news that it carried 45%
more passengers than British Airways' worldwide traffic in June.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "Once again consumers have confirmed resoundingly that Ryanair is the
         World's Favourite Airline.
        "Last month huge passenger demand for Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares
         and best customer service delivered 18% growth. Meanwhile British
         Airways shrank in size as consumers abandoned its high fares and
         multiple fuel surcharges.
        "When it comes to delivering what passengers want - the lowest fares and
         on-time flights - Ryanair beats BA time and time again".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
27 June 2007
       RYANAIR TO APPEAL UNLAWFUL EU DECISION TO COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE
              CALLS ON AER LINGUS TO SCRAP UNFAIR FUEL SURCHARGES
               LAUNCHES 2M SEATS FOR EUR10 (incl. taxes & charges)
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 27th June)
confirmed that it would appeal the EU Commission's unlawful decision to prohibit
the merger with Aer Lingus to the European Court of First Instance. Ryanair
expressed confidence that this prohibition will be overturned because;
 a. This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited a merger between
     two companies which combined will have less than 5 % of the EU market.
 b. This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited an airline merger
     and reverses a 20 year policy of encouraging EU airline mergers, having
     previously approved the larger Air France/KLM merger and the Lufthansa/
     Austrian/Swiss mergers.
 c. This is the first time that an EU airline merger offered guaranteed fare
     reductions of over EUR100m p.a. for the benefit of consumers.
 d. This prohibition leaves Aer Lingus exposed as a small, peripheral loss
     making regional airline which cannot compete with Ryanair on price or
     punctuality from Dublin (it has recently pulled off another 5 Ryanair routes
     from Dublin) at a time when the rest of the European industry is
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR TO APPEAL EU DECISION
     consolidating. Aer Lingus lost EUR70m last year despite an average short haul
     fare of over EUR90 (more than double Ryanair's average fare of EUR41).
Ryanair confirmed that the prohibition would be bad news for Aer Lingus'
passengers who will continue to suffer higher fares, unnecessary fuel
surcharges, poor punctuality and repeated strikes (such as the latest staff walk
out just two weeks ago).
Ryanair also criticised the continuing failure of the Board and Management of
Aer Lingus to deliver value for its customers or shareholders;
1. Aer Lingus fares are rising (in line with its IPO strategy).
 2. Aer Lingus has recently raised its unjustified fuel surcharges for long haul
     passengers.
 3. Aer Lingus has wasted almost EUR20m of shareholders' funds to oppose a bid of
     EUR2.80 per share when its share price is just EUR2.60.
 4. Aer Lingus has ordered new long haul aircraft recently when prices are at an
     all time high.
 5. Aer Lingus has (since Ryanair's offer) pulled services from 5 more Ryanair
     routes because it is unable to match Ryanair's punctuality or prices.
 6. Aer Lingus has supported the DAA's proposed T2 which will double passenger
     charges at Dublin and substantially increase Aer Lingus' costs.
 7. Aer Lingus has presided over a decline in the share price from over EUR3.00 to
     just EUR2.60 yesterday - significantly below Ryanair's offer price.
Aer Lingus' actions in recent weeks has damaged its cost base and destroyed
significant shareholder value. It would appear that the Board of Aer Lingus is
more interested in looking after its own interests and those of the Irish
Government than it is in lowering airfares or increasing its share price. In its
defence documents, Aer Lingus claimed that Ryanair's offer of EUR2.80 per share
"devalued Aer Lingus". How does it now explain or justify a share price as low
as EUR2.60, significantly less than Ryanair's offer?
Speaking today in Dublin Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said;
        "Aer Lingus claimed yesterday that the EU Commission's prohibition is
         'another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers'. This is nonsense. Aer
         Lingus' share price is now significantly below Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer
         which means that their shareholders are losing out. The fact that
         consumers will be denied the Ryanair guarantee of lower Aer Lingus fares
         and the elimination of fuel surcharges means that they will suffer a
         penalty of over EUR100m p.a.
        "Aer Lingus is continuing to waste shareholders' money by ordering new
         aircraft at the top of the cycle, by supporting expensive T2 facilities
         at Dublin airport which will double their costs and by wasting almost
         EUR20m of shareholders funds to oppose Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer. This waste
         has been reflected in their falling share price.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR TO APPEAL EU DECISION
        "We call on Aer Lingus to lower their fares and scrap these unfair fuel
         surcharges and at least deliver the same value to consumers that
         Ryanair's offer would. In the mean time Ryanair will continue to grow,
         will continue to offer lower fares and will continue to beat Aer Lingus
         on price and punctuality. We look forward to the European Courts
         overturning this unprecedented and unlawful prohibition".
The directors of Ryanair accept responsibility for the information contained in
this announcement, save that the only responsibility accepted by the directors
of Ryanair in respect of the information contained in this announcement relating
to Aer Lingus and the Aer Lingus Group, which has been compiled from published
sources, has been to ensure that such information has been correctly and fairly
reproduced or presented (and no steps have been taken by the directors of
Ryanair to verify this information). To the best of the knowledge and belief of
the directors of Ryanair (who have taken all reasonable care to ensure that such
is the case), the information contained in this announcement for which they
accept responsibility is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything
likely to affect the import of such information.

                              Aer Lingus Group plc
           Prohibition Decision a Boost for Aer Lingus and consumers
                     ISE: EIL1                   LSE: AERL
Dublin, 27 June, 2007:The Board of Aer Lingus ("the Board") welcomes the EU
Commission's prohibition decision, relating to Ryanair's hostile bid, announced
today (Wednesday, June 27, 2007) following an exhaustive investigation of the
competition issues surrounding this unwelcome bid.
"Today's prohibition decision, following the EU Commission's exhaustive
investigation, is good news for Aer Lingus and for our customers. Consumer
choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one
dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just
cannot be in the interests of consumers. Aer Lingus has made tremendous strides
over a relatively short time in successfully executing our strategy and that
Aer Lingus Group PLC Welcomes EU Decision
work will continue apace. We are determined to deliver on our excellent
prospects as an independent company and I'd like to thank our staff for their
continued commitment," said John Sharman, Chairman of Aer Lingus.
When Ryanair announced its offer last October, the Board advised shareholders to
reject the offer on the basis that it ignored the Company's excellent prospects
as an independent company and that it was anti-competitive.
The Board and management are focussed on delivery of Aer Lingus' strategy and
have made significant progress over the past nine months on its successful
execution. The EUR400 million raised in the IPO is facilitating the expansion and
replacement of short haul and long haul aircraft and the on-going development of
new routes.
   The Company has already announced its intention to place an order, price
     list valued at $2.4 billion, with Airbus for the delivery of six new
     A330-300E and six new A350 XWB aircraft.
   Aer Lingus was first "out of the blocks" announcing three new US routes on
     the day of the Open Skies agreement announcement in March.
   Two new high specification A330 aircraft will join the fleet this summer
     to facilitate long haul expansion.
   Our pioneering, web-based partnership with JetBlue will come into
     operation in August, offering customers access to 51 destinations across the
     US, Mexico and the Caribbean.
   13 new, long and short haul routes have been announced since the beginning
     of the year, bringing the number of European routes to 77 and North American
     routes to 7.
   A key element in our success to date is our relentless focus on cost. The
     Company is fully committed to the implementation of our efficiency programme
     PCI-07 which will generate annualised savings of EUR20 million and will
     eradicate un-competitive work practices.
   The results for the past fiscal year demonstrate high returns on invested
     capital, double digit revenue growth in all business areas, higher yields
     and strong growth in ancillary revenue, higher aircraft utilisation on an
     expanded route network.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
26 June 2007
                   EU COMMISSION TO BLOCK AER LINGUS TAKEOVER
         EUROPEAN CONSUMERS DENIED EUR100m P.A. IN LOWER FARES BY THE EU
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday 26 June) held a Press
Conference in Brussels to respond to the recent European Commission leaks
indicating that Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus will be prohibited. Ryanair
expects this prohibition decision to be announced by DG Competition over the
coming week.
Ryanair condemned this prohibition decision on a number of grounds as follows:
 1. This prohibition reverses 20 years of EU airline consolidation which has
     seen the Commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors
     including Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, all with
     minimal remedies.
 2. This prohibition is unjustified in the case of two airlines which between
     them account for less than 5% of the EU air travel market.
 3. The decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow
     interests of the Irish Government, which was the only party (other than Aer
     Lingus itself) to object to the merger.
Ryanair Holdings PLC EU TO BLOCK A LINGUS TAKEOVER
 4. This decision is bad for consumers, because it allows Aer Lingus to continue
     to increase its fares and levy unjustified fuel surcharges, both of which
     would have been reduced/eliminated had the Ryanair merger succeeded.
 5. The decision is manifestly erroneous as it applys a citypair analysis (e.g.
     claiming that Aer Lingus flights to Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle compete
     with Ryanair flights to Stansted and Beauvais) when every other EU airline
     merger precedents have applied an airport pair analysis (under which rules
     typically Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle would be deemed to be separate
     markets from Stansted and Beauvais respectively).
 6. The decision is manifestly in error since it is based on the Commission's
     inaccurate claim that there are barriers to entry at Dublin Airport, when
     the case file evidence clearly proves that there are no barriers to entry at
     Dublin Airport.
 7. The decision inaccurately claims that other competitors would not enter
     Dublin Airport, when the case file proves that other competitors have
     confirmed they will enter Dublin Airport.
 8. The decision is based on applying a "base" competition concept which has no
     precedent and is a misapplication of 25 year old US cases.
 9. The Commission wrongly claims that Aer Lingus has a record of entering
     routes where Ryanair operates. In fact the opposite is the case. Aer Lingus
     has withdrawn from over 20 Ryanair routes in the past 7 years.
The decision ignores the substantial consumer benefits of over EUR100m p.a.
guaranteed by Ryanair's remedies package which included:
 1. Reducing Aer Lingus's short-haul fares by 10% p.a. (saving consumers over
     EUR70m p.a.).
  2. Immediately eliminating Aer Lingus's fuel surcharges (saving consumers over
     EUR30m p.a.).
  3. Transferring Heathrow slots to BA and Air France, who will each base
     aircraft in Dublin.
  4. Transferring Dublin slots to other competitors, as long as they based
     between 6 to 10 new aircraft in Dublin (a total of over 2,800 weekly slots).
This prohibition will make further European airline consolidation more difficult
to proceed including for example the rumoured takeover of Alitalia by Air One,
and the rumoured acquisition of Iberia by a British Airways led consortium. At a
time when European airlines are facing renewed competition from American mega
carriers under EU-US Open Skies, this prohibition reverses the Commission's 20
year policy of encouraging EU airline consolidation, denies Aer Lingus
passengers a guarantee of lower fares and zero fuel surcharges, and shows the
Commission's lack of impartiality or balance in cases which conflict with the
narrow vested interests of national governments.
Speaking at today's press conference in Brussels, Ryanair's Chief Executive,
Michael O'Leary said:
    "The European Commission's decision to prohibit this merger between two EU
     airlines which between them represent just 5% of European airline traffic is
Ryanair Holdings PLC EU TO BLOCK A LINGUS TAKEOVER
     not just unprecedented, but in our view unlawful.
    "We call on the Commission to explain how it can rubber stamp mergers
     between larger airlines such as Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and
     Lufthansa/Austrian, when these airlines have bigger positions at their home
     airports than the combined Ryanair/Aer Lingus share at Dublin Airport. When
     Air France which has over 60% share of aircraft movements at Paris CDG is
     allowed by the Commission (with minimal remedies) to acquire KLM which has
     over 60% share of movements at Schipol, it is untenable that the Commission
     now changes these rules, to prohibit a Ryanair/Aer Lingus merger which will
     result in a similar 60% share of movements at only one airport Dublin which
     is currently doubling its capacity. Whereas the Air France/KLM merger,
     resulted in significant fare increases, Ryanair has offered unprecedented
     remedies which include over EUR100m p.a. of guaranteed fare and fuel surcharge
     reductions. It is obvious that the Commission is applying a unique and
     unprecedented set of rules in the Ryanair/Aer Lingus case.
    "The Commission's case as set out in its Statement of Objections is
     materially inaccurate. There were over 100 material errors and, inaccuracies
     in the Commission's SO. The Commission has already admitted that its own
     econometric analysis was inaccurate by a factor of 100. Many of the
     Commission's claims (which were transposed verbatim from the false claims
     made by the Irish Department of Transport and Aer Lingus) are factually
     untrue.
    "Air Berlin recently completed the acquisition of Deutsche BA and LTU in
     Germany. Both of these takeovers were approved by the German Competition
     Authority with minimal remedies, despite the fact that they led to higher
     fares and fuel surcharges for DBA and LTU passengers. Similarly Flybe has
     recently acquired BA Connect from British Airways under a merger whereby
     British Airways acquired a 15% stake in Flybe, the UK's second largest low
     fares airline. Yet again the UK Office of Fair Trading approved this merger
     with very minimal remedies. It is surprising that the only airline merger in
     Europe over the past 20 years which has been prohibited is this proposed
     Ryanair/Aer Lingus takeover. The only difference with this merger is the
     opposition of the Irish Government and one can only conclude that the
     European Commission's decision to prohibit is a political one to appease the
     Irish Government rather than advance the interests of Aer Lingus's consumers
     and European competitiveness generally.
    Ryanair, which currently owns just 25% of Aer Lingus, will appeal this
     prohibition to the European Court of First Instance, and seek to have it
     overturned. The Court has overturned several Commission prohibitions and we
     expect the Court will do so again in this case. European consumers should
     not be denied the lower fare and fuel surcharge savings which will follow
     from a Ryanair/Aer Lingus merger. Ryanair calls on the European Commission
     to explain how it can rubber stamp Air France's and Lufthansa's
     acquisitions, as well as all other EU airline mergers over the past 20
     years, yet now prohibit a merger between two Irish airlines which combined
     account for less than 5% of EU airline traffic. We are confident that the
     European Courts will overturn this bizarre, illogical, manifestly inaccurate
     and untenable prohibition.
    Ryanair also confirmed that it will oppose any attempt by the European
     Commission to require it to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair
     highlighted that it owns just 25% of Aer Lingus, and has no control over Aer
     Lingus which remains controlled and run by the Irish Government and its
     trade unions. Ryanair highlighted that in recent months it has called upon
     Aer Lingus to lower its airfares - yet Aer Lingus has raised them. Ryanair
     has also called on Aer Lingus to remove its unjustified fuel surcharges -
     yet again Aer Lingus has since raised them. The fact that Aer Lingus's share
     price has now fallen to EUR2.50, some 30 cents below the Ryanair offer of
     EUR2.80 per share suggests that the Board and management of Aer Lingus are
     putting the interests of its major shareholder, the Irish Government, over
Ryanair Holdings PLC EU TO BLOCK A LINGUS TAKEOVER
     the interests of other Aer Lingus shareholders who should be entitled to
     accept Ryanair's offer and this is a very worrying development for ordinary
     Aer Lingus shareholders.
    Aer Lingus fares last year were more than twice those of Ryanair, and
     rising. Aer Lingus passengers continue to suffer high fuel surcharges
     whereas Ryanair guarantees "no fuel surcharges". With this decision, Aer
     Lingus' high fares and fuel surcharges will continue. Aer Lingus' passengers
     should send the bill for their higher fares and fuel surcharges to the
     European Commission, rue de la Loi 200, Brussels!".

    Editor's Note:
    Finally, Ryanair welcomed the confirmation of the EU Ombudsman that he will
     investigate a series of leaks by the EU Commission in this case and its
     failure to take any action against Aer Lingus for leaking/publishing details
     of Ryanair's confidential remedies to the markets.

Dear Mr. Callaghan:

Wellington Management Company, LLP ("Wellington Management") is registered as an
investment adviser with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and
acts as discretionary investment manager on behalf of various separate accounts
(the "Accounts") that hold an interest in shares of the Company. Wellington
Management's interest in the shares is as an investment manager, as is mentioned
in Sections 67(1) and 77(4)(B) of the Companies Act 1990 (the "Act"). The
Accounts do not act as a group nor do they act in concert with respect to the
interests in shares. Wellington Management acquired the interests in shares for
the Accounts in its capacity as discretionary investment manager to, and solely
for the benefit of, the Accounts, and the interests were acquired solely for
investment purposes. The shares are registered in the name of the Accounts or
the Accounts' custodians or nominees according to their respective holdings.
2
Wellington Management as discretionary investment manager on behalf of the
Accounts, has purchased, in the aggregate, an interest within the meaning of
Sections 67(1) and 77(4)(B) of the Act. Wellington management currently holds
9,224,746 ordinary shares and 14,013,786 ADR shares. On a converted basis, this
represents the equivalent of 79,293,676 ordinary shares, or 5.13% of the shares
outstanding, of the Company.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
21 June 2007
This announcement replaces RNS 7910Y released at 13:12 today.
                      RYANAIR CALLS ON AVIATION REGULATOR
                          TO BLOCK GOLD PLATED TERMINAL
                          OR MAKE AER LINGUS PAY FOR IT
Ryanair, Ireland's national airline, today (Thursday, 21st June 2007) filed
comments on the Commission for Aviation Regulation's ("CAR's") Draft Decision on
the Review of Airport Charges. Ryanair called on CAR to either block DAA's gold
plated plans for the EUR850m Second Terminal at Dublin Airport, as it is the wrong
size, in the wrong location and wrong cost, or force Aer Lingus, who will occupy
the massively oversized and grossly expensive facility, to pay for it. Ryanair's
passengers should not be forced to pay higher charges for a terminal they will
never use. The CAR's own consultants have now confirmed what Ryanair has been
saying all along, i.e., that the size of T2 is between 32% and 56% too big and
too expensive.
Ryanair Holdings PLC CALLS ON AVIATION REGULATOR
Ryanair also criticised the CAR for its inaction over the past two years, which
has allowed the airport monopoly to more than double planned capital expenditure
(from EUR571m. to EUR1,178m.), increase the size of T2 by 50% (from 50,000m2 to over
75,000m2), with the costs more than quadrupling (from between EUR170m.- EUR200m. to
over EUR850m.).
Commenting on the CAR's Draft Decision and Ryanair's response, Ryanair's Head of
Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
        "The CAR's draft decision has now confirmed what Ryanair has been saying
         all along - DAA's T2 is excessively large and grossly expensive. DAA is
         driving this development for the sole purpose of inflating its so-called
         regulated asset base (RAB), from which airport charged are derived,
         which will allow it to an almost doubling in airport charges. Despite
         this, the CAR is allowing DAA to proceed with this development and the
         Regulator expects Ryanair's passengers to subsidise this white elephant,
         which will never be fully utilised because of Fingal County Council
         planning restrictions, which place a ceiling on the combined capacity of
         Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 of 30-35 mppa.
"Ryanair's submission to the CAR focuses on the following points:
   Excessive Size and Cost of Terminal 2 The CAR has finally forced DAA to
     produce the passenger forecasts and busy hour rates that DAA claims to be
     the basis for the massive increase in the size and cost of T2. As a result,
     the CAR's consultants have verified what Ryanair has been saying all along -
     i.e., that the numbers produced by DAA are entirely fictitious and that the
     size of T2 is grossly excessive. DAA is building a facility for 25 mppa as
     opposed to the 10 mppa permitted under the Fingal County Council Local Area
     Plan (LAP). It is now clear that T2 as proposed by DAA is inappropriate and
     DAA must be forced to provide a low cost, efficient facility that meets the
     requirements of the vast majority of users at Dublin Airport.
   The Capacity of Terminal 1 and the Requirement for Additional Capacity at
     Dublin Airport. The CAR should be analysing the total capacity of both T1
     and T2 and ensuring that DAA is prevented from building excessive capacity
     that cannot be used given the current 30-35 mppa cap on traffic by Fingal
     County Council. By Ryanair's calculation, DAA is proposing to build between
     15 mppa and 20 mppa of entirely unnecessary capacity between T1 and T2 and
     the CAR cannot allow DAA to recover its costs on any of this excessive
     capacity.
   Lack of Proper Consultation. Consultation has been farcical throughout
     the T2 and CIP (Capital Investment Programme) processes and the CAR has
     failed to attend any of the so-called consultation meetings, despite
     repeated requests from users. DAA has consistently stonewalled users'
     reasonable requests for information and has refused to consider lower cost
     options for airport developments. This has led to grossly inefficient and
     expensive developments, including T2, the proposed terminal 1 extension
     (T1X), and Pier D. DAA should not be allowed any recovery on these
     developments beyond what meets the reasonable requirements of users and
     based on objective cost benchmarking.
   Excessive Cost of Other Developments. Although the Draft Decision and
     related reports confirm that DAA's costs for various developments are
     excessive, the analysis does not go far enough and merely relies on DAA's
     own benchmarking report - which generally compares costs with other DAA
     projects or BAA developments - another highly inefficient airport monopoly.
     The CAR also fails to consider the work carried out by its own consultants
Ryanair Holdings PLC CALLS ON AVIATION REGULATOR
     regarding benchmarking against other low cost facilities around Europe. For
     example, DAA intends to spend a further EUR400m. on extending/refurbishing T1
     but stated at the planning inquiry that at the same time it intends to
     reduce the capacity of T1 from the current 25mppa to 15mppa. It is
     incomprehensible that the CAR should contemplate allowing DAA to waste a
     further EUR400m. on T1 when DAA has stated that it will reduce capacity by
     some 40%.
   The Charges Determination for the Period 2006-2009. Ryanair has
     demonstrated that the current charges being paid by airport users under the
     regulatory cap are too high given the fact that there are unjustified costs
     in the RAB (Regulated Asset Base) and the number of passengers currently
     using Dublin Airport is considerably higher than originally forecast by DAA.
     Charges should therefore be reduced. Moreover, passenger charges should be
     further reduced in the next review based on a much lower cost for T2
     (approximately EUR150 million for a 10 mppa terminal) and other developments,
     including Area 14 and Pier D.
Based on the above, Ryanair has called on the CAR to:
 1. The DAA should only be allowed to recover the financing costs on 10 mppa
     worth of capacity in T2, given the current planning restrictions on the
     Eastern Campus, taking into account the 25 mppa threshold of capacity
     provided by Terminal 1;
 2. The DAA should therefore only be allowed to recover reasonable costs for T2
     - i.e., no more than EUR150 million necessary to build a 10 mppa terminal
     facility;
 3. Require Aer Lingus and any other T2 users to pay for the cost of T2.
     Ryanair's passengers should not be forced to cross subsidise a terminal they
     will never use;
 4. Claw back the cost of Pier C, the EUR150m., 7-year old pier which will now
     become redundant under DAA's plans for T2.
 5. Claw back the excessive financing costs allowed in the current regulatory
     determination;
 6. Claw back the grossly excessive costs of Pier D and other projects when
     benchmarked against other low cost developments elsewhere in Europe;
 7. Disallow any future projects that do not meet the reasonable requirements of
     users, following proper consultation, and that do not have the agreement of
     the majority of airport users.
 8. Provide for strict requirements regarding information disclosure, including
     the independently verified costs of each project, by the regulated monopoly
     and actual consultation with users regarding all of the options;
 9. Attendance by the CAR at all future consultation meetings to ensure that the
     regulated monopoly is properly consulting with users.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
19 June 2007
                            3 MILLION SEATS FOR GBP10
                    ONLY RYANAIR GUARANTEES THE LOWEST FARES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 19th June 2007)
released 3 million GBP10 seats (taxes and charges included) for travel in July,
August and September and challenged Easyjet to step up to the plate by offering
passengers a real price guarantee instead of the misleading 'non guarantee' it
has been peddling for the last two weeks.
Easyjet's guarantee is worthless because it avoids comparisons with Ryanair.
Unlike Easyjet, Ryanair's Price Guarantee compares all flights from all airports
between two cities while Easyjet's so called guarantee is confined to flights
between the same airports, which in many cases means Easyjet is the only
operator.
For example, between London and Milan, Ryanair's Price Guarantee allows
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3 MILLION SEATS FOR 10 GBP
comparison with over 70 flights operated by 4 airlines, flying between 5 London
airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, & City) and 3 Milan (Malpensa,
Linate & Bergamo ) airports.
In contrast, Easyjet's 'non guarantee' does not allow comparisons, for example,
between Easyjet and any other airline between London Gatwick and Milan Malpensa
because it is the only airline to operate that route.
Speaking today, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
"Today Ryanair is releasing 3 million summer seats for GBP10 - less than a quarter
of Easyjet's average fare. Easyjet can't match Ryanair's low fares and that is
why it is hiding behind its bogus guarantee.
"Ryanair has written to the Advertising Standards Authority to request that
Easyjet stop claiming to guarantee the lowest fares when it is clear that they
don't.
"Meanwhile if passengers want the lowest fares guaranteed and 3 million seats
for GBP10, there is only one place to find them and that is on www.ryanair.com".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
14 June 2007
                      13 NEW RYANAIR ROUTES FROM STOCKHOLM
  ALICANTE, BASEL, BERLIN, BRATISLAVA, EINDHOVEN, KARLSRUHE BADEN, LIVERPOOL,
                 MALTA, PISA, PORTO, SALZBURG, TRAPANI & VALENCIA
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 14th June 2007)
announced 13 new routes from its Stockholm Skavsta base to Alicante, Basel,
Bratislava, Eindhoven, Baden Baden, Liverpool, Malta, Pisa, Porto, Salzburg,
Trapani and Valencia. These new routes will start in October, when Ryanair will
invest $140m and add two new Boeing 737 800s (total 6) at its Stockholm Skavsta
base.
Announcing these 13 new routes, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
       "Ryanair low fares in Sweden have been a tremendous success because
         Swedish passengers can't stand SAS's high fares and frequent strikes.
         With these new routes Ryanair will carry 2.5m passengers annually to and
         from Stockholm Skavsta at less than one third of SAS's high fares. This
         generates a visitor spend of 5bn SEK in the region and delivers
         passenger savings of 3bn SEK.
       "Only Ryanair guarantees the lowest fares from Sweden. If any passenger
Ryanair Holdings PLC 13 New Routes from Stockholm
         finds a lower fare with another airline on the same route, Ryanair will
         refund double the difference. To celebrate these 13 new routes, we are
         giving away 100,000 seats from Stockholm for just 220 SEK (just the
         taxes), and we urge all passengers to log onto www.ryanair.com
         immediately, as seats this cheap will sell out fast."
    Route                           Starts        Frequency

               IATA CONFIRMS RYANAIR IS WORLD'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (12th June 2007) welcomed
IATA's
2006 world airline passenger statistics which confirm that Ryanair carries more
international passengers than any other airline.
Ryanair has become the world's favourite airline, carrying more international
passengers than Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways and American Airlines by
offering the lowest fares and the best customer service.
Welcoming this World No. 1 ranking, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter
Sherrard said
        "Ryanair's No. 1 world ranking confirms that passengers can't get enough
         of our guaranteed lowest fares. Just 10 years ago most of the other
         airlines on this IATA ranking carried ten times more passengers than
         Ryanair. Today Ryanair carries more international passengers than anyone
         else in the world. This growth has been delivered by giving passengers
         exactly what they want; the lowest fares, the best punctuality, the

         youngest aircraft and no fuel surcharges guaranteed".

                    RYANAIR NO 1 AGAIN FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 7th June 2007)
welcomed the publication of the Q1 Consumer Report from the Association of
European Airlines. This report demonstrates that no other airline can match
Ryanair's punctuality and customer service.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications, said:
        "The high fare airlines simply can't compete with Ryanair on price or on
         customer service either. These latest statistics prove that Ryanair is
         Europe's undisputed leader, with the best punctuality, the fewest lost
         bags and the least cancellations. Only Ryanair guarantees the lowest
         fares and delivers number one customer service".

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted income statement excluding the exceptional items referred to below.
Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2007 amounted to EUR34.2m which
primarily arose from the one time release of an overprovision, principally from
deferred tax. In the year ended March 31, 2006 there was also an exceptional
receipt of EUR5.2m (net of tax) arising from the settlement of an insurance claim
for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Profit after tax increased by 42% to EUR435.6m compared to EUR306.7m in the previous
year ended March 31, 2006, whilst adjusted profit after tax increased by 33% to
EUR401.4m

                    RYANAIR REPORTS RECORD PROFITS OF EUR401m,
                     PROFITS UP 33% AS TRAFFIC GROWS TO 42.5M
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low fares airline, today (5 June) released record net
profits of EUR401m, a 33% increase over the prior year figure and EUR11m ahead of
previous guidance. Ryanair's traffic grew by 22% to 42.5m, yields rose 7%, as
revenues grew by 32% to EUR2.24bn. Unit costs increased by 9% mainly due to a 50%
increase in fuel costs. Despite this significantly higher fuel bill, Ryanair
maintained an industry leading after tax margin of 18%.

Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"These record profits and the strong growth in traffic, yields and revenues
during a period of much higher oil prices and intense competition is a tribute
to the strength of Ryanair's lowest fare model. The highlights of the past year
include:
   Profit growth of 33% to EUR401m - Up EUR100m on last year.
    Traffic growth of 22% to 42.5m.
    Purchase of 30 new aircraft, bringing the fleet to 133 units at year end.
    Opening 153 new routes (including 3 new bases at Marseille, Madrid and
     Bremen).
    Fuel costs increased by 50% to EUR693m.
    Industry leading customer service and No.1 for pricing and punctuality.
    Widened the price gap between Ryanair and our competitors.
    Purchased 25.2% of Aer Lingus plc.
    Strengthened the balance sheet with year end cash of EUR2.2bn.
The unusual feature of these results was the 7% rise in average fares, despite
the 22% growth in traffic. This increase was largely driven by competitor fare
increases and competitor fuel surcharges, as well as our checked baggage fees
which are designed to encourage passengers to travel with carry-on luggage only.
Ancillary Revenues grew by 40% thanks to a better passenger spend, increased
penetration, and the growth of excess baggage revenues. In March we announced an
agreement with Expedia, our new hotel provider, and we expect that ancillary
revenues will continue to grow at a faster rate than scheduled traffic.
Due primarily to a 50% increase in fuel costs, unit costs rose by 9%. This was
also impacted by a one off step up in our pilot crewing ratio due to longer
sector lengths. We took advantage of recent dollar and oil price weaknesses to
extend our fuel hedges to 90% for the remainder of fiscal 2008 at an average
cost per barrel which is 10% lower than last year. This cost saving will help us
to offset significantly higher airport charges this year at Stansted (where
airport charges doubled on 1 April), and Dublin Airport, who continue to impose
unjustified price increases despite delivering a sub-standard service through a
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results
portacabin facility. These monopoly price increases demonstrate again the abject
failure of Aviation Regulators in both Ireland and the UK to protect the
interests of consumers.
We continue to press for the break-up of the BAA airport monopoly and welcome
the recent OFT and Competition Commission investigation of the BAA. The current
BAA Stansted plan to waste almost GBP4bn building a second runway and terminal
(which should cost less than GBP1bn) provides further proof of this monopoly
abuse. Similarly at Dublin, Ryanair opposes the ludicrous plans to waste over
EUR800m building a 15 MPPA passenger terminal which Ryanair is willing to build
(and pay for) at a cost of less than EUR200m. The Irish Regulator has failed to
investigate or explain why the DAA's costs of this facility have quadrupled over
the past year without any increase in capacity. His current proposal that
Ryanair passengers who will never use T2 should pay higher airport charges to
fund it, is contrary to the "User Pays" principle of aviation regulation. The
significant cost increases associated with these higher airport charges at
Stansted and Dublin since April, combined with Gordon Brown's decision to engage
in "highway robbery" by doubling UK airport departure taxes has had a negative
impact on traffic and yields.
Forward bookings and yields continue to be soft and Ryanair continues to respond
with aggressive price promotions including a current offer of GBP20 off all return
fares on all flights. As has always been the case, Ryanair will lead and win
every fare war in Europe, because Ryanair has the lowest costs and the lowest
fares.
Ryanair has recently extended this price war by launching a unique "lowest
price" guarantee. Subject to the terms and conditions of this programme, Ryanair
will refund double the difference to any passenger who can find a lower fare
from any competitor airline on any Ryanair route. Thus far we have paid
remarkably few claims, simply because no other airline can match Ryanair's low
fares.
The European Commission's review of Ryanair's proposed offer for Aer Lingus has
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results
been ongoing for the past 6 months. The decision by DG Competition to refer this
merger to a Phase 2 review was unprecedented and a radical departure from the
Commission's long standing policy of encouraging EU airline consolidation. It is
difficult to understand how the EU can wave through precedent mergers (such as
Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Eurowings and Lufthansa/SAS) in Phase 1 with minimal
remedies, yet in this case a merger of two Irish airlines with bases at a
peripheral European city (Dublin), which together account for less than 5% of EU
traffic, has been referred to Phase 2. Ryanair's proposed remedies now include
guaranteed fare and fuel surcharge reductions of over EUR100m per annum for Aer
Lingus consumers, combined with the surrender of a significant number of
Heathrow slots (the most valuable in the world) and Dublin slots. Accordingly,
any failure by the European Commission to approve this merger will be an
entirely political decision to put the narrow political interests of the Irish
Government before those of European competition and European consumers. Ryanair
will immediately refer any such prohibition to the European Courts, and given
the significant inaccuracies and omissions in the Commission's Statement of
Objection we believe that any Court challenge has a high prospect of success.
Ryanair's "lowest fare" business model is strongly cash generative. Cash on hand
at March 31st 2007 amounted to EUR2.2bn. At the AGM on September 22nd 2006 the
shareholders authorised that the Directors could re-purchase Ordinary shares
("buyback") amounting to 5% of the Company's issued share capital. The Directors
have decided, in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a
whole, to undertake a buyback programme, under which up to EUR300 million would be
available for return. At the current market price of EUR5.20 this equates to a buy
back of approximately 3.63% of the existing issued share capital of the Company.
We anticipate starting the buyback programme on/after June 7th 2007 onward.
Ordinary shares will be repurchased under the programme in accordance with the
provisions of the Company's annual re-purchase authority and the requirements of
the Irish Stock Exchange and UK Listing Authority rules. The Company's brokers,
Davy, will conduct the share buyback programme, and shares repurchased will be
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results
cancelled immediately. Only Ordinary shares (and no ADR's) will be repurchased.
As we indicated at the release of our April traffic statistics, we have recently
noticed a softening of market conditions which has been reflected in lower load
factors and yields. Whilst we remain confident that traffic over the coming year
will grow by 22% to over 52 million passengers, we believe that if trading
conditions continue to be soft, then yields will fall by up to 5% compared to
last year's figure. Unit costs will rise over the coming year by 6% or 7%,
largely due to longer sector lengths (+7%), substantially higher airport charges
at Stansted and Dublin and a one time increase in cabin crew ratios, although
these will be partially offset by the lower fuel costs already secured through
our hedging programme. As a result we expect profit growth over the coming year
to be more modest and to rise by approximately 5%. At this time with no
visibility of Winter bookings and yields, we believe that the Company and our
shareholders should remain cautious and conservative. We expect the seasonality
established over recent years to continue and the vast majority of our annual
profits will be generated in the first half of the fiscal year, with a
consequent reduction in profitability and maybe even small losses being recorded
during quarters 3 and 4.
Over the coming year Ryanair will increase its fleet by a net 30 aircraft as we
have commenced our planned disposal programme and have already sold 5 aircraft
delivered in 1999. We will launch at least 3 new bases (2 of which,
Dusseldorf-Niederrhein and Bristol, have been announced), and we expect to open
more than 50 new routes. We will continue to aggressively stimulate traffic
growth by promoting Ryanair's lowest fare guarantee in every market. If market
conditions continue to be soft, as is presently the case, then this ambitious
traffic growth can only be delivered by discounting fares and reducing yields.
This remains an extremely volatile and cyclical business, but over time the
price leaders such as Southwest in the U.S. and Ryanair in Europe have

pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers,
market prices for the replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental,
safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., European Union ("EU")
and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in
currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general
economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general
willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political
factors.
Ryanair is Europe's largest low fares airline with 20 bases and 487 low fare

      The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     half year ended March 31, 2007 on June 01, 2007.
3. Available for Sale Securities
    During the year the company acquired a 25.2% stake in Aer Lingus at a cost
     of EUR344.9m. This is reflected at market value at March 31, 2007 at EUR406.1m.
    US GAAP
4. Accounting for Share-Based Payments
    Under SFAS No. 123R, which was adopted by the Company on April 1, 2006, the
     Company is required to account for share-based employee compensation using a
     fair value based method. The Company has elected to use the Binomial Lattice
     option pricing model to determine the fair-value of share-based awards under
     SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that previously used for pro forma
     disclosures under SFAS No. 123 ("Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation").
    The Company has elected to use the modified prospective transition method as
     permitted by SFAS No. 123R and accordingly prior years have not been
     restated to reflect the impact of the revised standard. In this year's
     financial information, the Company has, as a result of the adoption of SFAS
     No. 123R, recorded incremental share-based compensation expense of EUR3.9m in
     its US GAAP income statement.
    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured compensation
     expense for its employee share-based compensation plans using the intrinsic
     method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25. The Company applied the disclosure
     provisions of SFAS No. 123, as if the fair value based method has been
     applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when
     the exercise price of the Group's employee share options was equal to the
     market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, no compensation
     expense was recognised. If the Company had applied the fair value
     recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to share-based compensation during
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -6-
     the year ended March 31, 2006, reported income under US GAAP would have
     changed from EUR314.8 million to EUR311.9 million with resulting Net income per
     ADS, basic and diluted, of 101.69 Euro cents and 101.04 Euro cents
     respectively.
5. Accounting for Pensions - US GAAP
        The Company also adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158 "Employers'
         Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Plans"
         in the year to 31 March 2007. This requires the full fair value of the
         group's defined benefit pension obligations to be recognised within the
         group's US GAAP balance sheet, whereas previously, under SFAS No. 87
         "Employers Accounting for Pensions" such obligations were permitted to
         be partially recognised in certain circumstances using the "Corridor
         Method". The adoption of this standard had no effect on the consolidated
         income statement of the group however, resulted in a net decrease of
         EUR2.7m in the group's shareholders' equity in accordance with US GAAP in
         the year to March 31, 2007 only. In accordance with the transition
         provisions of that standard shareholders' equity as previously reported
         for the year to March 31, 2006 remains unchanged.

Profit after tax increased by 33% to EUR401.4m, compared to EUR301.5m in the
previous year ended March 31, 2006. These results reflect a 7% increase in
average fares (including checked in baggage revenues), very strong growth in
ancillary revenues, offset by significantly higher fuel costs, which increased
by 50% to EUR693.3m, and a one off step up in pilot crewing ratios which resulted
in staff costs rising by 32% to EUR226.6m. Total operating revenues increased by
32% to EUR2,236.9m, which was faster than the 22% growth in passenger volumes, as
average fares rose by 7% and ancillary revenues grew by 40% to EUR362.1m. Total
revenue per passenger as a result increased by 8%, whilst Passenger Load Factor
decreased by 1 point to 82% during the year.
Total operating expenses increased by 33% to EUR1,765.2m, due to the increased
level of activity, and the increased costs, associated with the growth of the
airline. Fuel, which represents 39% of total operating costs compared to 35%
last year, increased by 50% to EUR693.3m due to substantial increases in the US
dollar cost per gallon, partially offset by a positive movement in the US dollar
exchange rate versus the euro and an average 3% reduction in fuel consumption
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -5-
resulting from the installation of winglets on our Boeing 737-800 fleet. Unit
costs excluding fuel and staff costs remained flat. Staff costs rose by 32%
reflecting an increase in pilot crewing ratios primarily as a result of the
ongoing increases in sector length. As a result, operating margins decreased by
1 point to 21%, whilst operating profit increased by 28% to EUR471.7m.
Net Margins remained flat at 18% for the reasons outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share have increased by 32% to 25.99 cent for the year.
Balance Sheet
The strong growth in profitability continues to positively impact the balance
sheet with Total Cash increasing by EUR226.0m to EUR2,198.0m despite acquiring a
25.2% stake in Aer Lingus for EUR344.9m and funding an additional EUR489.2m in
capital expenditure largely from internal resources. This cashflow part funded
the extensive aircraft delivery programme and additional aircraft advance
payments. Total debt net of repayments increased during the year by EUR184.3m.
Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2007 have increased by EUR547.8m to EUR2,539.8m,
compared to March 31, 2006 due to the EUR401.4m increase in profitability during
the year, the exercise of share options which increased shareholder funds by
EUR11.2m and the impact of the IFRS accounting treatment for derivative financial
instruments, financial assets, pensions and stock options are accounted for
within equity and which also increased shareholders funds by EUR99.0m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Year ended March 31, 2007
Profit after tax, increased by 33% to EUR401.4m due to a 7% increase in average
fares (including checked in baggage revenues), strong growth in ancillary
revenues, offset by increased fuel costs which rose by 50% to EUR693.3m primarily
reflecting the higher US dollar cost per gallon and a one off step up in staff
costs, due to higher pilot crewing ratios, which rose by 32% to EUR226.6m.
Operating margins, as a result decreased by 1 point to 21%, which in turn
resulted in Operating profit increasing by 28% to EUR471.7m compared to year ended
March 31, 2006.
Total operating revenues increased by 32% to EUR2,236.9m whilst passenger volumes
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -5-
increased by 22% to 42.5m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 8% in the
year due to higher average fares and strong ancillary revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 31% to EUR1,874.8m due to a 7% increase
in average fares (including checked baggage revenues) reflecting the benign
yield environment during the year supported by competitor fuel surcharges.
Passenger volumes increased by 22% to 42.5m reflecting increased passenger
numbers on existing routes, the successful launch of our new routes and bases.
Load factor decreased by 1 point to 82% during the year due to the 23% increase
in seat capacity.
Ancillary revenues continue to grow faster than passenger volumes with revenues
increasing by 40% to EUR362.1m in the year. This performance reflects the strong
growth in on board sales, non-flight scheduled revenues including excess baggage
revenue. On March 22, 2007 we announced a new five year hotel partnership with
Expedia.
Total operating expenses rose by 33% to EUR1,765.2m due to the increased level of
activity, and the increased costs associated with the growth of the airline
particularly higher fuel and staff costs. Total operating expenses were also
adversely impacted by a 6% increase in the average sector length, whilst higher
US dollar fuel prices were partially offset by the strength of the euro exchange
rate against the US dollar.
Staff costs have increased by 32% to EUR226.6m. This primarily reflects a 30%
increase in average employee numbers to 4,462 and the impact of pay increases
granted during the year. Employee numbers rose due to an increase in pilot
crewing ratios as a result of continued increases in sector length. Pilots, who
earn higher than the average salary, accounted for 43% of the increase in
employees during the year.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 15% to EUR143.5m. There are an
additional 19 'owned' Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the fleet this year compared to
last year. The resultant higher depreciation charge was offset by a combination
of lower amortisation due to the retirement of Boeing 737-200 aircraft and the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -5-
positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of
Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the euro versus the US dollar also
had a positive impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 50% to EUR693.3m due to a 25% increase in the number of hours
flown and a 28% increase in the average US dollar cost per gallon of fuel
partially offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro versus
the US dollar and a 3% reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of
winglets on our Boeing 737-800 fleet.
Maintenance costs increased by 12% to EUR42.0m, reflecting improved reliability of
the Boeing 737-800's operated, due to a combination of the rise in the number of
leased Boeing 737-800 aircraft from 17 to 32, a lower level of maintenance costs
incurred due to the retirement of the Boeing 737-200's, and the positive impact
of the strengthening of the euro versus the US dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 71% to EUR23.8m due to a higher
level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to the previous
year as the number of routes operated rose by 67% to 428 at the year end and the
number of bases increased by 3 to 18.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 23% to EUR58.2m reflecting an additional 15
leased aircraft during the year.
Route charges rose by 21% to EUR199.2m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and an increase of 6% in the average sector length, offset by a reduction
in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 27% to EUR273.6m. This is higher than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports, particularly at our Dublin base, which has grown
significantly this year and has a much higher average cost per passenger, offset
by lower costs at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 23% to EUR104.9m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
reductions on some indirect costs.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -5-
Operating margins have declined by 1 point to 21% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 28% to EUR471.7m during the year.
Interest receivable has increased by 65% to EUR63.0m for the year due to the
combined impact of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in
average deposit rates earned in the year.
Interest payable increased by 12% to EUR82.9m due to the drawdown of further debt
to part fund the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher
interest rates.
Foreign exchange losses have decreased during the year to EUR0.9m due to the
positive impact of changes in the US dollar exchange rates against the euro
compared to last year.
The gain on disposal of fixed assets of EUR0.1m arises from the disposal of
various plant & equipment.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in
profits during the year. The Company generated cash from operating activities of
EUR869.9m which part funded the investment in financial assets (Aer Lingus) of
EUR344.9m and capital expenditure incurred during the year with the balance
reflected in Total Cash of EUR2,198.0m. Capital expenditure amounted to EUR494.9m
which largely consisted of advance payments for future aircraft deliveries and
the delivery of fifteen aircraft. Long term debt, net of repayments increased by
EUR184.3m during the year.
Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2007 has increased by EUR547.8m to EUR2,539.8m,
compared to March 31, 2006 reflecting the EUR401.4m increase in profitability
during the year and the exercise of share options which increased shareholder
funds by EUR11.2m and the impact of the IFRS accounting treatment for derivative
financial instruments, financial assets, pensions and stock options which are
accounted for within equity and which also increased shareholders funds by
EUR99.0m.

31 May 2007
                       RYANAIR LAUNCHES 8 NEW ROUTES FROM SHANNON
    BIRMINGHAM, DUBLIN, FUERTEVENTURA, KAUNAS, LEEDS, LUTON, RIGA & TENERIFE
        Ryanair, Ireland's National airline, today (Thursday, 31st May 2007)
         announced eight new routes from its Shannon base to Birmingham, Dublin,
         Fuerteventura (Canaries), Kaunas, Luton, Leeds, Riga and Tenerife, which
         will start in November. From November, Ryanair will also increase the
         frequency of its Edinburgh (to daily) and Manchester (to 6 weekly)
         services. This expansion includes Ryanair's first domestic route from
         Shannon to Dublin and brings the number of destinations offered from the
         airport to 31.
        Announcing these new routes, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
            "With Ryanair's latest expansion at Shannon, 1.7m passengers
             annually will enjoy Ireland's lowest fares guaranteed. This will
             deliver a visitor spend of EUR250m and support 1,700 jobs in the West.
             In the space of just 2 years, Ryanair has delivered dramatic tourism
             and economic growth for Shannon and the West as promised.
            "Shannon is now accessible from Galway in just over 1 hour thanks to
             the new Ennis by-pass, making Ryanair's 31 low fare routes at
             Shannon the low fare reference point for the whole of the West of
             Ireland. We look forward to delivering significant economic benefits
             for Galway and Connemara with these additional passenger numbers.
            "Our new, twice daily commuter route to Dublin will allow people
             from the West to fly day returns from Shannon and avoid the M50
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LAUNCHES 8 NEW ROUTES
             traffic chaos for less than the price of half a tank of petrol.
            "To celebrate these 8 new routes, we have slashed EUR20 off all return
             flights and we urge passengers to book these lowest fares today on
             www.ryanair.com, as these bargains will sell out quickly".
In welcoming these new routes, Martin Moroney, Director, Shannon Airport, said:
            "We are delighted to see further expansion of Ryanair's operations,
             particularly the inclusion of Dublin in its route network, offering
             a daily return service. Galway is an important part of our catchment
             area for both inbound and outbound traffic, and we look forward to
             working with the tourism and business sector in harnessing support
             for these new services. Ryanair now carries over 50% of the terminal
             passenger traffic at Shannon airport and we look forward to working
             with them in the future as we expand our business".
Niall Gibbons, Director, Corporate Services, Tourism Ireland added:
            "Tourism Ireland, the organisation responsible for marketing the
             island of Ireland overseas, has warmly welcomed the announcement of
             the expansion of Ryanair services from Britain and Mainland Europe
             into Shannon Airport. Both markets were key drivers behind the
             record visitor numbers to Ireland last year so it augurs well for
             the season ahead. This expansion of services will make it even
             easier for visitors from these important markets to explore the many
             attractions on offer in the Shannon region".

         Lodz and Rome while Biarritz, Carcassonne, Milan, Murcia, Nantes and
         Venice will operate on a summer only basis (Apr - Oct) to accommodate
         these 8 new routes.

               RYANAIR BUYS 27 MORE BOEING 737-800s WORTH $1.9 BN
                       GBP20 OFF RETURN FARES TO CELEBRATE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 31st May 2007)
announced the purchase of 27 more Boeing 737-800s valued at $1.9bn. This brings
Ryanair's total firm orders for B737-800s to 308 and total fleet size (including
planned disposals) to 262 by 2012.
Ryanair operates one of the youngest and most fuel efficient fleets of any major
airline (137 Boeing 737-800s) with an average aircraft age of just 2.5 years.
All of these new aircraft will be fitted with Boeing blended winglets, which
will further reduce fuel burn and CO2 emissions, strengthening Ryanair's
position as Europe's cheapest, greenest and cleanest airline.
Ryanair's CFO and Deputy Chief Executive, Howard Millar said:
        "Ryanair guarantees passengers that they will not find a cheaper fare
         with any other airline on any of its 487 routes. The combination of the
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR - Boeing Purchase
         lowest per seat operating cost and the reliability of these Boeing
         737-800s will benefit millions of additional passengers in the coming 5
         years as we extend our route network and our guaranteed lowest fares.
        "To celebrate, we are slashing GBP20 off all return fares. These
         guaranteed lowest fares are available for one week only and we urge
         passengers to book today on www.ryanair.com".
Marlin Dailey, Boeing's VP of Sales Europe Russia and Central Asia, said:
        "The 737-800 continues to demonstrate its exceptional suitability for
         the low-fare business model. It consistently generates more revenue and
         more profit through industry-leading reliability and higher utilization.
         Boeing values Ryanair's continued endorsement of the Next-Generation
         737".

24 May 2007
                     RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 20th BASE IN BRISTOL
                  13 NEW ROUTES - 2 AIRCRAFT, $140M INVESTMENT

Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 24th May 2007)
announced its 20th European base in Bristol. From November, Ryanair will invest
$140m in two new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which will operate 16 routes to / from
Bristol delivering over 1m passengers in 2008 and doubling to 2m passengers in
2009.
Announcing Ryanair's 20th base, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
        "Ryanair's base will deliver a fivefold increase in our passenger
         numbers at Bristol and will transform air travel in the South West by
         allowing even more passengers to enjoy Bristol and Europe's lowest fares
         guaranteed. This investment will deliver passenger savings of over GBP30m
         p.a. compared to Easyjet's high fares while generating a visitor spend
         of GBP250m, which will sustain 2,000 jobs in the region.
        "To celebrate Ryanair is offering 100,000 seats from Bristol for GBP10,
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR ANNOUNCES 13 NEW ROUTES
         including taxes and charges for one week only on www.ryanair.com. This
         is half the price of Easyjet's latest attempt to reduce their high fares
         and we urge passengers to book immediately as demand for Ryanair's
         lowest fares guaranteed will be very strong".

        "Ryanair guarantees* the lowest fares in Italy, and if any passenger
         finds a cheaper fare on the same route with any other airline, Ryanair

Airport. Lufthansa have consistently tried to block competition from Ryanair in
Frankfurt Hahn Airport, including trying to stop Ryanair from using the name of
the airport (!) when Ryanair opened its second continental base there in 2002.
In the case thrown out today by the Court in Bad Kreuznach,Lufthansa was
attempting to use the state aid rules to overturn Ryanair's deal with Frankfurt
Hahn, something that other high fare carriers have sought to do in the past.
However, the court rejected all of Lufthansa's claims.
Welcoming the decision of the Court, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs and
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR WELCOMES COURT DISMISSAL
Company Secretary, Jim Callaghan, said:
        "We are delighted with today's ruling of the Court in Bad Kreuznach,
         which dismissed all of Lufthansa's spurious claims regarding Ryanair's
         commercial deal with Frankfurt Hahn. This latest legal action by
         Lufthansa shows how desperate they are to block competition from
         Ryanair. Lufthansa have tried every trick in the book since we entered
         the German market to deny German consumers the benefits of Ryanair's low
         fares, including constantly running to the German courts. The fact that
         they would try to undermine Ryanair's successful partnership with
         Frankfurt Hahn Airport, the fastest growing and most successful low cost
         airport in Europe, proves that consumers and visitors to Germany are
         choosing Ryanair's low fare services to Frankfurt Hahn over Lufthansa's
         high fares in Frankfurt Main.
        "In 2005, Ryanair announced that it was expanding its partnership with
         Frankfurt Hahn and would base up to 18 aircraft at the low cost
         alternative to Frankfurt. This was about the time when Lufthansa decided
         to lodge its claims to the Regional Court of Bad Kreuznach and they also
         sent a similar complaint to the European Commission. This is despite the
         fact that Frankfurt Hahn Airport is owned by Fraport, one of the most
         successful commercial airport operators in the world, and in which
         Lufthansa has a 10% share holding!
        "Today's ruling is a major victory for Ryanair's successful partnership
         with Frankfurt Hahn Airport but also for German consumers and visitors
         to Germany, who now have a choice over Lufthansa's high fares.
        "This is the second defeat suffered by Lufthansa in recent weeks. An
         appeals court recently upheld an injunction against Lufthansa where they
         were trying to create the impression that they offer low fares. The
         Court found that Lufthansa's advertising was misleading to consumers.
        "Ryanair is also calling on the European Commission to reject
         Lufthansa's complaint, which contains the same spurious claims as those
         dismissed by the Court in Bad Kreuznach."

         RYANAIR CALLS ON AER LINGUS TO REMOVE RIP-OFF FUEL SURCHARGES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 9th May 2007)
called on Aer Lingus to remove its unfair fuel surcharge of EUR100 return. Today,
Aer Lingus announced that it was increasing its rip-off fuel surcharge by over
40% from EUR70 to EUR100 return.
Ryanair is the only European airline to guarantee no fuel surcharges - not
today, not tomorrow, not ever.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said:
        "Today's unjustified 40% increase in Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges further
         highlights the savings for consumers, which would follow if Ryanair
         succeeds in acquiring Aer Lingus. As Ryanair's offer document confirmed,
         we plan to remove these unfair and unjustified fuel surcharges as well
         as reducing Aer Lingus's short-haul airfares. Aer Lingus' plan is to
         increase fares and further raise these unfair and unjustified fuel
         surcharges.
        "Passengers who wish to avoid these high fares and fuel surcharges can
         book one of Ryanair's 10 million seats from EUR10 one-way (including taxes
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR - no AL fuel surcharge
         and charges) with a 'no fuel surcharge guarantee".

                        RYANAIR APRIL TRAFFIC GROWS 19%
Commenting on the April Traffic Statistics Michael O'Leary CEO of Ryanair said:
        "Our April traffic growth of 19% underlines the robust nature of the
         Ryanair lowest fare model during periods of softer market conditions.
        "Load Factors are down from 85% to 83% a fall of 2%, primarily due to
         the 21% growth in capacity, with 27 aircraft deliveries across the
         winter period and the launch of 3 new bases - Marseille, Madrid and
         Bremen. The doubling of UK APD and Airport charges at Stansted as well
         as increased charges at Dublin Airport have also impacted load factors
         and given rise to a softer yield environment. We expect this weakness in
         load factors and softer yields to continue through Q1 and Q2".
