Norwegian Air Shuttle has stumbled from crisis to crisis in recent years. But the coronavirusinspired slump in 
demand is the most serious test yet for Europe's third-largest low-cost airline. The collapse in passenger numbers 
is putting all airlines in a tight spot, pushing them to cancel flights and seek ways of cutting costs fast as revenues 
evaporate. Norwegian is especially exposed due to its high debt burden incurred through a decade of rapid 
expansion.
Analysts are worried it could breach its bond covenants or simply run out of cash. Last year, it overcame similar 
Doomsday concerns to survive through a mixture of rights issues and other radical actions. Can it pull off the same 
trick again? At first, the litany of problems Norwegian has faced in the past two years appear to be down to bad 
luck. The airline had big problems with the engines on its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft in 2018. A few months 
later, it was further hurt when the same manufacturer's 737 Max planes were grounded after two fatal crashes. Now 
the coronavirus has hit, sending Norwegian's shares down by almost three-quarters in the past month alone to their 
lowest level since 2005.
But some analysts argue that for all Norwegian's inability to catch a break, its real problem is its lack of cash 
reserves if something goes wrong. The airline sector is an industry where unexpected things are prone to occur; 
that leaves what Andrew Lobbenberg at HSBC calls the "world's most levered listed airline" susceptible to shocks.
Litany of problems at Norwegian puts safe landing in doubt INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE
Norwegian's net debt has increased from NKr22bn ($2.3bn) in 2017 to NKr58bn at the end of last year - in large 
part due to accounting rule changes on leases - just as its equity market capitalisation has plunged to NKr1.8bn. 
Analysts at ABG Sundal Collier show its net debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation) ratio is 7.1, compared with an average of 1.8 for European carriers - and just 0.5 for low-cost airlines 
such as Ryanair and easyJet.
Norwegian, like nearly all carriers, is taking action. On Tuesday, it announced 3,000 flight cancellations - or about 
15 per cent of its capacity between mid-March and mid-June - and warned staff in a note "to be prepared for a 
scenario where we reduce capacity by up to 50 per cent".
Few in the industry - executives, analysts or investors - know how big the knock will be. Analysts at ABG already 
worried last week that Norwegian could break the book equity covenant on its bonds in the second quarter of this 
year. They also forecast that its net cash of NKr3bn - compared with revenues of NKr43.5bn last year - could shrink 
to just NKr880m by the end of June.
Mr Lobbenberg said on his models of falls in unit revenues this year of 3-7 per cent, "Norwegian lives" in each 
scenario. But, he added: "If it's materially larger, you do challenge those covenants."
Thus many speculate that Norwegian will need to tap shareholders for the fourth time since March 2018. ABG 
analysts estimated Norwegian could have to raise up to NKr3bn, close to double its current market value, to avoid 
facing the same worries next year. But raising capital during such a crisis is far from straightforward. "It's possible 
that launching a rights issue in the current environment wouldn't work," said Mr Lobbenberg.
The market is looking closely at what Geir Karlsen, Norwegian's chief financial officer, can do after he positively 
surprised investors last year. He shifted the strategy from growth to profitability, and unveiled a package of 
measures to shore up the balance sheet. Debt was restructured, a long-awaited aircraft joint venture unveiled, and 
a stake in the bank the airline founded sold off.
Then late last year Norwegian's board upset many in the market by passing over Mr Karlsen for the chief executive 
job, instead choosing a former retail executive and McKinsey consultant, Jacob Schram.
As the coronavirus deepens in Europe, the flight path for Messrs Schram and Karlsen to guide Norwegian to safety 
is getting more and more turbulent.

T WOULD be great to go back-toback in the Pertemps Final (2.10pm) today with SIRE DU BERLAIS.
IHe's 4lbs higher than when winning last year but he did manage to carry 11st 9lbs to victory 12 months ago so I 
wouldn't be too worried.
I rode him at Leopardstown in December, and it was hard work to be honest, but he showed a bit more spark at 
Warwick and is hopefully coming good at just the right time.
He's an experienced old pro who'll probably race a little lazily with me just cajoling him along and hopefully we'll get 
a nice run like last year.
My other ride today is FULL OF SUPRISES in the Mares' Novices' Hurdle (5.30pm).
She won nicely first time up at Catterick before disappointing when well-backed at Wetherby.
Based on that last run she'll need to improve a lot, but the yard obviously has some belief that she's got the ability 
to compete in a race like this.
Elsewhere, Faugheen would get a huge reception if he were to win the Marsh Novices' Chase (1.30pm), and he 
has every chance based on his three runs this season.
I just wonder if 2m4f will prove a bit sharp for him and I'd rather be with Itchy Feet.
As for the Ryanair (2.50pm), I'm with Min all day long.
His form is rock solid, and I'd take him over A Plus Tard who is a very good horse but has still got it all to prove.
Barry Geraghty
If there's one with a bigger chance than Min today, then it's Paisley Park in the Stayers' Hurdle (3.30pm).
Like most, I think he's the banker of the meeting.

ONLY the eight runners are set to line up in the Ryanair Chase (2.50pm), which is one of the feature races on the 
penultimate day of the meeting. Last year's winner Frodon is back to defend his crown with Bryony Frost in the 
saddle and the rain that fell earlier in the week will certainly help his cause.
However, there is a feeling that this is a far better race than he won 12 months ago and he may just struggle to 
repel a strong Irish challenge.
Anyone who witnessed A PLUS TARD demolish his field in last year's novices' handicap by 16 lengths knew they 
were watching something a bit special.
He went on to finish third on his next start in a Grade One over three miles at Punchestown and the trip seemed to 
stretch him that day.
After blowing the cobwebs away on his seasonal reappearance, he landed a Grade One success at Leopardstown 
over an inadequate 2m1f trip where he was too good for Chacun Pour Soi.
He's been kept fresh for this race by his in-form trainer Henry De Bromhead who feels this intermediate trip will suit 
him even better.
There was always the option of running him in yesterday's Champion Chase over two miles, but connections felt 
they may just have gone too quick in the early stages for A Plus Tard.
A PLUS TARD ALL SET FOR TAKE OFF IN THE RYANAIR Bill Esdaile previews the Ryanair Chase and 
Mares' Novices' Hurdle
This looks the right race and I suggest taking the 7/4 on offer with Paddy Power as I think he will be too good for 
Min who looks his biggest danger.
Willie Mullins' runner is desperately unlucky to have been born in the same era as Altior having chased him home 
here in both his Supreme Novices' Hurdle and his first Champion Chase victory.
The team blamed tactics for last year's poor run at the Festival and he showed at Aintree that this trip is far more to 
his liking.
He's definitely a threat to my selection but looks likely to come up just short again on a track where he doesn't 
always look the most natural.
Riders Onthe Storm had a hard race at Ascot last time but is improving and cannot be discarded.
He has benefited from the change of stables and Nigel Twiston-Davies seems to be getting the best out of him.
Don't forget he had Cyrname beaten when that horse crashed out late on last time, but he looked weary at the 
finish and hasn't had long to recover.
Another at an even bigger price who could go well is Saint Calvados who has been carrying big weights in handicap 
company.
He will relish the cut in the ground and this trip and track seems to suit him well.
At 20/1 you could do a lot worse than have a sporting each-way bet on him if A Plus Tard's price is too short for 
you.
Last season's Mares' Novices' Hurdle (4.50pm) produced a 50/1 shocker and the nature of the race means you 
could easily have another upset.
When you throw 22 unexposed lightly raced young mares into the cauldronlike atmosphere of the Festival, you 
have all the ingredients for an upset.
That is unless there is a potential star lurking amongst them and that well could be the case with another De 
Bromhead runner in MINELLA MELODY. The same trainer-owner combination were responsible for Tuesday's 
Mares' Hurdle winner Honeysuckle and they may have another real talent on their hands.
She is already three from three over hurdles having been too good for a few of today's rivals already.
She took the step up to Grade Three company in her stride last time winning over a bit further than today's trip in 
facile style.
Her stamina will stand her in good stead this afternoon and the 11/4 available with Ladbrokes looks the call.

Pod people: the rise of capsule hotels

Highlight: With consumers actively looking for ways to make accommodation budgets go further, capsule hotels 
and hostels are becoming an increasingly popular option.
Body
As guests may be in town for just one night and spend very little time in their room other than to sleep, they may 
see little need to pay more for a large room when a smaller, more cost-effective option is available. Although 
somewhat basic, they can provide guests with all the essentials in compact setting. Capsule accommodation is not 
just a cost-effective option for guests. Hotel operators are being converted by the economics, as they are able to fit 
in more guests in a smaller amount of space. 
There is some variation in what is considered to be capsule or pod accommodation. Some options have a fully 
enclosed room with an en-suite bathroom, whereas others consist of what is effectively a bunk bed with a privacy 
curtain in a multi-bed dormitory and facilities shared with other guests. Already widespread across South East Asia 
for almost three decades, capsule hotels are now popping up throughout major European cities. This type of 
accommodation is only expected to grow further over the next decade as developers try to do more with less room. 
Current estimates suggest that the capsule hotel market is due to increase by 6.31% CAGR by 2026 and be worth 
approximately $288m. From stopgap to quirky, trendy convenienceFor an experience so often associated with 
luxury, how did the idea of staying in a space no bigger than a single bed come about? "Capsule hotels became 
popular in Japan throughout the 1980s when they served as a stopgap for busy workers trying to avoid their long 
commutes. Now, they are seen as a quirky and trendy place to stay, while still providing the same benefit - a cheap 
bed to sleep in, in a convenient location," explains GlobalData travel and tourism analyst Laura Beaton. "Similar to 
how companies like Ryanair and easyJet have mastered unbundling flight services, these capsule hotels are 
another example of companies stripping down a service in order to offer the lowest price possible. "For example, 
Zip by Premier Inn is based on the premise of capsule hotels but are located on the outskirts of cities instead.  The 
rooms are billed as 'basics done brilliantly' and are around less than half the size of a standard Premier Inn room, at 
just 8.5m2. The first was opened in Cardiff in 2019 and offers rooms for as little as £19 a night. "As the experience 
economy continues to drive consumer choice, travellers are less interested in full-service flights and glitzy hotels - 
they prefer to spend their funds on visiting attractions, eating out and exploring the culture of their destinations." 
Pod people: the rise of capsule hotels
The fact that rooms at Zip by Premier Inn were developed by PriestmanGoode - which has designed first-class 
cabins for airlines such as Air France and Lufthansa - goes to show just how seriously hotel operators are taking 
accommodation in this emerging market. The company is now also developing another Zip site in Southampton, 
which will have 140 rooms. Should these prove popular, it is not unreasonable to predict that more will follow. 
Hybrid accommodationSome capsule accommodation can be a hybrid of a hotel and a hostel. In so far as they 
have their own compact private area to sleep and relax, but have shared bathrooms and other communal areas. 
One provider of this type of accommodation is CityHub, which operates sites in Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the 
Netherlands, with another location due to open mid-2020 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company aims to combine 
the level of comfort expected in a hotel, with the friendly, informal atmosphere and prices of a hostel. "People, 
especially younger generations, are travelling much more than in the past. They travel more often, for shorter 
periods of time and often on a budget. Capsule hotels represent an efficient response to their need for a base to 
explore cities on a budget without giving up comfort, privacy and an experience that feels unique and it's worth 
sharing," says Flavia Larocca, spokesperson for CityHub. "On the other hand, for hotel developers, capsule hotels 
represent a very efficient use of space especially in key gateway cities where real estate is very expensive. "Our 
travellers spend most of their trip getting to know the city, meeting its locals and hanging out with our community. 
That's why we brought the bedroom back to its essential functions by eliminating the unnecessary extra square 
metres." Privacy for backpackersIt is in the backpacker market where the capsule concept is likely to be the most 
popular. This is because the prospect of sharing a dormitory with 11 or more strangers can be off putting for first 
time or solo travellers. Open dorm type accommodation also becomes less appealing the longer a trip lasts. 
Although many capsule hostels still have what is essentially a dormitory and bunk beds, the added features of an 
individual curtain, bedside table, night-light and plug socket adds an extra layer of privacy. Most beds also have a 
designated locker to keep belongings safe. "You can close your pod with a curtain at the end of your bed, which 
also is a bit more soundproof. It is like a bunk bed in a way that you have someone sleeping above and someone 
under, but because of the way it's created you won't feel anything moving. If the person above you moves, you 
won't you won't feel it if you're staying underneath," Rafy Limoges customer relations and brand manager for Code 
Pod Hostels. The company runs what it describes as luxury pod hostels in Edinburgh and Dublin. "It's an affordable 
price. Usually people who stay in hostels also want to meet other fellow travellers. And then on top of it if you can 
get the privacy, it's kind of a win-win," adds Rafy Limoges. "It is basically what bunk beds lack. I stay in hostels. The 
fact that your own space, but then you're sharing bathroom, you're sharing the room and you're sharing kitchen still, 
you can still socialise. But then when you want to be on your own, you have this ability. Travelling can be tiring, you 
walk all day, sometimes you don't feel for socialising. I call it 'the future for hostels'."

mask watches monitors at the foreign exchange dealing room of the KEB Hana Bank headquarters in Seoul, South 
Korea, Thursday, March 12, 2020. Asian shares plunged Thursday after the World Health Organization declared a 
coronavirus pandemic and indexes sank on Wall Street. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)NEW YORK (AP) — The 
Latest on the action in the financial markets (all times local): 9:55 a.m. For the second time this week, stock prices 
tumbled so sharply at the opening bell a circuit breaker meant to slow down panic trading was triggered on Wall 
Street, halting all activity for 15 minutes. The S...00 fell 7% shortly after the opening bell, triggering an automatic 
trading halt. 
Once trading resumes, if the S... decline expands to 13%, trading will once again be suspended for 15 minutes. If 
the drop eventually reaches 20%, trading will stop for the day.  Before Monday, the circuit breakers instituted after 
the market crash of 1987 had only been triggered once, back in 1997.  9:10 a.m. The European Central Bank is 
deploying new stimulus measures to cushion the economic pain inflicted by the virus outbreak.  The central bank 
decided Thursday to buy up 120 billion euros more in bonds, money that is newly created and injected into the 
financial system. It is also providing cheap loans to banks to make sure they have the liquidity needed.  It's all 
aimed at helping businesses get financing and stimulating activity to offset the downturn from all the closings and 
restrictions due to the virus outbreak.  The 19 countries that use the euro is likely facing a recession this year.  ___ 
8:30 a.m. Shares of companies in the travel sector continue to struggle amid the virus outbreak as demand 
weakens. President Donald Trump's 30-day ban on most Europeans entering the United States seemed to heighten 
investors' concerns.  Airline stocks such as Delta, Jet Blue and American Air Lines fell approximately 9% to 15% in 
premarket trading. In Europe, shares are down roughly 6% to 9% for airlines including Lufthansa, Air France and 
Ryanair. (Ad) A young company, with a low stock price, has met that challenge with a huge Nevada source. Aside 
from Trump's travel ban, the industry has started to reduce flights and implement hiring freezes as it looks for ways 
to reduce costs. Many businesses are telling employees not to travel and major sporting events and conference are 
being canceled or are proceeding with restricted access.  Shares of cruise operators like Carnival and Norwegian

on the action in the financial markets (all times local): 9:10 a.m. The European Central Bank is deploying new 
stimulus measures to cushion the economic pain inflicted by the virus outbreak.  The central bank decided 
Thursday to buy up 120 billion euros more in bonds, money that is newly created and injected into the financial 
system. 
It is also providing cheap loans to banks to make sure they have the liquidity needed.  It's all aimed at helping 
businesses get financing and stimulating activity to offset the downturn from all the closings and restrictions due to 
the virus outbreak.  The 19 countries that use the euro is likely facing a recession this year.  ___ 8:30 a.m. Shares 
of companies in the travel sector continue to struggle amid the virus outbreak as demand weakens. President 
Donald Trump's 30-day ban on most Europeans entering the United States seemed to heighten investors' 
concerns.  Airline stocks such as Delta, Jet Blue and American Air Lines fell approximately 9% to 15% in premarket 
trading. In Europe, shares are down roughly 6% to 9% for airlines including Lufthansa, Air France and Ryanair.  
Aside from Trump's travel ban, the industry has started to reduce flights and implement hiring freezes as it looks for 
ways to reduce costs. Many businesses are telling employees not to travel and major sporting events and 
conference are being canceled or are proceeding with restricted access.  Shares of cruise operators like Carnival 
and Norwegian Cruise Lines dropped about 10% to 12% before the U.S. market opens, while stocks for hotel

CPA[1] reported mixed traffic numbers for February 2020. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger 
miles (RPMs), inched up 0.4% to 1.64 billion in the month. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity 
(measured in available seat miles/ASMs) remained flat at 1.96 billion.With traffic expanding and capacity remaining 
flat, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased 40 basis points (bps) to 84%.In the first two months of 
2020, the carrier generated RPMs of 3.5 billion, down 2.9% year over year. In the same time frame, Copa Holdings 
recorded ASMs of 4.1 billion, down 3.8%. With traffic declining less than the amount of capacity contraction, load 
factor increased 80 bps to 84.1%.This fall in capacity was primarily due to extended grounding of the Boeing 737 
MAX jets. The carrier with six Boeing MAX 9 jets in its fleet removed all MAX flights from its schedule through 
August 2020. Consequently, multiple fight cancellations are affecting revenues.Copa Holdings, S.A. Price

Mar 11, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Trains, planes 
and vehicles leaving Italy faced new restrictions after the Italian government and nearby countries imposed drastic 
quarantine measures to contain the coronavirus.Spain and Portugal suspended air traffic from Italy for two weeks 
while Austria ordered a halt to flights and trains from its neighbour and Slovenia said it would impose controls at its 
border with the country.As British Airways cancelled Italian flights on Tuesday, Air France and low-cost carriers 
Ryanair, Easyjet and Wizz Air said they would scrap flights from Italian airports until early April.Air Canada took 
even more drastic measures, suspending flights to Italy until at least May 1.However, at Rome's main Fiumicino 
airport there were still services running to destinations in Europe and beyond on Tuesday afternoon, as well 
domestic flights. Disruption, but no complete shutdown Photo: AFP / MIGUEL MEDINA Flights were also still taking 
off from the smaller Ciampino airport, used mostly by budget airlines.Tourists welcomed the remaining opportunities 
to leave. "We have people saying they will put us on a flight back," Mina, a 58-year-old Indian national, told AFP 
next to Rome's deserted Colosseum, adding she and her family were "waiting for a call."The ADR company which 
runs Rome's airports said all arriving passengers and all those heading for destinations outside the Schengen zone 
"will undergo health checks" and go through thermal scanners.Australia on Wednesday said it would bar entry to 
foreign nationals who had been to the Mediterranean country in the last 14 days -- measures already in place for 
arrivals from China and South Korea. 
Tourists are facing longer stays in Italy than planned Photo: AFP / Alberto PIZZOLI Mask-wearing police at Rome's 
main Termini train station were checking passengers' reasons for travel and making sure everybody kept the 
recommended distance of one metre away from each other.But the departures board was showing no sign of any 
cancellations.Klemen Gartner, a 22-year-old seminarian from Slovenia, said that he was trying to get back home, 
"somewhere I can understand the language".He said that when station staff realised he wasn't Italian, he was told: 
"You're foreign? Go, go!" and waved through. 'You're foreign? Go, go!" Photo: AFP / Miguel MEDINA The rail 
service for Venice via Florence was only sparsely occupied but running nonetheless, with no checks for passengers 
disembarking at Florence, an AFP journalist said.But some rail links with neighbouring countries have taken a 
hit.The Thello company has cancelled its night services between Paris and Venice, as well as daytime trains 
between Milan and Marseille, until early April.France's national train company SNCF said on Tuesday it was 
"waiting for advice" about how to proceed regarding services to Italy.Since late February, French staff on cross-
border SNCF trains have been getting off before the Italian border and being replaced by Italian colleagues.Some 
train services between Italy and Austria were still running Tuesday but that was expected to change, a 
spokeswoman for Austrian rail operator OeBB told AFP.A spokeswoman for Germany's Deutsche Bahn said that 
Virus Crackdown Throws Italy Transport Into Chaos
the only service it had linking it to Italy, between Munich and Venice, has been suspended.On Italy's road links to 
other countries seemed more relaxed on Tuesday afternoon.Cars crossed the border with neighbouring Slovenia in 
both directions, an AFP journalist reported.Italians in the area around the city of Trieste often make the short 
journey into Slovenia to do their shopping and buy cheaper fuel.But late Tuesday, Slovenia's government 
announced it would close the border, with controls put in place "as soon as possible", although cargo transport 
would not be affected."It is not a hermetic closure... It is a necessary move if we want to contain the virus," 
Slovenia's outgoing prime minister Marjan Sarec told reporters.Also exempted from Austria's travel ban are cargo 
transporters, people with a doctor's certificate, and returning Austrians who agree to a two-week quarantine, the 
Austrian government announced.The wave of cancelled trips is raising fears for Italy's tourism sector, which 
accounts for 13 percent of the country's gross domestic product.

Mar 11, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  The only tourists 
outside Florence's majestic cathedral were a suitcase-laden couple rushing to leave Italy, where a nationwide virus 
shutdown is devastating an already fragile tourism industry."Everything's closed, we're going home," said German 
Alex Gross, 32, as his girlfriend nervously checked for updates on her phone. "That is, unless our flight gets 
cancelled."Many holidaymakers had already made their escape when Italy started succumbing last month to 
COVID-19, which has killed 631 people there so far and infected over 10,000, mainly in the country's wealthy north.

two options: stay holed up in their hotels, relying on mini-bar snacks for dinner, or head home."We've had over 90 
percent of bookings cancelled, even as far ahead as June," said Nicola, a hotel manager in Florence who did not 
want to give his last name. 
"Though if we've not resolved the virus situation before then, empty rooms will be the least of our problems," he 
said.From the Colosseum to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the government has shuttered all museums and 
monuments, ordered restaurants and bars to close at 6pm, and told people to leave their homes only if strictly 
necessary until April 3. From the Colosseum to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Italian government has shuttered all

television screens, Italians watched as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told them they have to make big sacrifices to 
stop the virus in its tracks and prevent Italy's health system collapsing under the strain.Hotel manager Nicola said 
that sacrifice would likely mean most hotels would be forced to close, "though some of the bigger structures like us 
may be asked to remain open in case they're needed as makeshift hospitals".Agostino Ferrara, 52, who has owned 
the Spada restaurant in the centre of Florence for 28 years, says he has been forced to put a large part of his staff 
on forced leave after the 140 covers a day dropped to 20."I've never seen anything like this," he said softly, as the 
kitchen staff set about cleaning up the few pots and pans.I'm optimistic though, because we know people tend to 
forget horrid things," he added with a small smile."My hope is, we'll make it through this, and a few weeks, a few 
months later, everyone will return to Italy."In even greater numbers than before."

European countries attempted to block a severe coronavirus outbreak in Italy from spreading any further on 
Tuesday with travel bans and warnings, as they introduced ever stricter measures to contain their own domestic 
epidemics.
Speaking during a video conference of European Union leaders late on Tuesday, European Council President 
Charles Michel urged the continent to coordinate its response to the crisis.
"The virus is spreading in all member states," said Michel. "I think therefore we should try to coordinate as much as 
possible and see where we can do more together."
His remarks were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday evening, who tweeted that Europe 
should prevent instability and do everything necessary to protect people's health and the economy.
Their comments came as the World Trade Organization cancelled all meetings through March 20 after learning that 
one of its employees has become infected with the new coronavirus.
As the virus spreads, multiple countries - including Austria, Malta, Serbia and Spain - banned flights from Italy, 
which has seen by the worst outbreak in Europe, with more than 460 deaths and has gone into nationwide 
lockdown.
Denmark said it had banned flights from badly affected areas, including parts of Italy, while Austrian Airlines 
stopped flights to the northern Italian cities of Venice, Milan and Bologna.

Serbia, which now has five confirmed cases, on Tuesday refused to permit 10 travellers to disembark from their 
plane from Bergamo and returned them to Italy. Croatia, with 14 cases, said it would quarantine all arrivals from 
Italy.
Spain raised its own concerns after registering a sharp jump in cases to 1,600, up 400 from the day before, and 
announced it would close its parliament until further notice.
The virus has now been reported in all 27 member states. France confirmed 372 new coronavirus cases in the last 
24 hours, taking the total to 1,784, with 33 deaths. Britain confirmed an additional 54 cases, taking the country's 
total to 373, including six deaths.
Nadine Dorries, Britain's minister for patient safety, suicide prevention and mental health, also tested positive to the 
virus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
Swiss authorities confirmed the number of cases in the country rose to 476, an increase of 52 per cent on the 
previous day.
A German woman on vacation in Northern Cyprus was diagnosed with coronavirus, state news agency Anadolu 
reported, the first such case in the Turkish-administered part of the divided island.
Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca also confirmed the first case in Turkey on Tuesday night, saying that a male 
citizen who recently returned from Europe tested positive, according to Anadolu.
Airlines joined the efforts to limit the spread from Italy, with British Airways announcing it was cancelling all 
Tuesday's flights to and from the country.
Other airlines went one step further, with Ryanair suspending flights to and from Italy until April 8 and Air France 
and Easyjet until April 3.
Airlines have been badly hit by travel bans, with Norwegian the latest to announce flight cancellations. The carrier 
said it was cancelling an estimated 3,000 flights until mid-June - about 15 per cent of its flying capacity.
On the Spanish island of Mallorca, hoteliers said they were eyeing a dramatic slump in Easter bookings with 
concern.
Germany confirmed on Tuesday that the virus had reached all 16 of its federal states, after authorities in Saxony-
Anhalt announced their first infections.
The outbreak originated in central China in December and has spread rapidly, with about 110,000 people infected 
worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, of which over 3,800 have died.
Throughout Europe, cultural and sporting life ground to a standstill in more places, as Poland and Slovakia joined 
Italy in banning all sports and cultural events. Austria and the Czech Republic stopped all indoor events with more 
than 100 participants.
Slovakia's measures are in place for 14 days, whereas the ban in Poland did not have an end date, and spans 
professional football games and concerts, among others. However, theatres, opera houses, philharmonic concert 
halls or art galleries are exempt.
Pop star Madonna announced she was cancelling two Paris concerts on March 10 and 11 after the French 
government banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people.
Berlin's Senate said it was cancelling all state-owned theatre, opera and concert events until the end of the Easter 
break.
In the Vatican, St Peter's Square and St Peter's Basilica have been closed to the public due to the crisis.

Greece is set to temporarily close its schools. In Poland, several universities cancelled classes and other events 
while President Andrzej Duda said he would refrain from organising large gatherings as he campaigned ahead of 
May's election.

EasyJet and Ryanair rallied after Bernstein Research advised buying.
"This may be the best entry point for European airlines in a long time," it said.
"Airlines in Europe have never been cheaper in the past 15 years, the sector has never been more consolidated, 
the largest players have never commanded more market share, sector profitability is at its highest level in all of 
history, liquidity is at record levels, and fuel is approaching the lowest levels since 2004," Bernstein added. "This is 
a bad time to be an airline executive but it's a great time to be an investor."
Informa led the FTSE 100 gainers even after the events group said with full-year results that the coronavirus had 
led it to postpone business worth over £400m.
JPMorgan Cazenove told clients to use any weakness as an opportunity to buy into a "structurally resilient 
industry", saying Informa's forward bookings looked strong and there was limited potential for bottlenecks once 
events get rescheduled.

EU cuts landing slots rules in bid to help airlines; CORONAVIRUS

THE EU yesterday yielded to industry demands in dropping its so-called "use it or lose it rule" for landing slots in a 
bid to give the industry some relief amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Under the regulations, airlines must run the majority of their scheduled services or risk losing the profitable slots, 
which has led to some airlines operating "ghost flights" so as not to forfeit the slots.
Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has now said that the bloc would temporarily do 
away with the measure as airlines continued to cancel thousands of flight due to a slump in passenger demand.
Virgin Atlantic, one of the airlines which admitted to flying empty flights, said that although the move was a "positive 
step", it needed confirmation that the alleviation would apply to all markets for the full summer season.
The suspension came as airlines continued to cancel flights, with beleaguered Norwegian announcing it would 
slash 3,000 flights - around 15 per cent of its capacity - until mid-June, as well as bringing in temporary lay-offs for 
its workforce.
The low-cost carrier is widely tipped as the most likely airline to follow Flybe into administration due to its hefty debt 
pile. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said that "you have to ask whether Norwegian will avoid the same fate": 
"Normally, we'd be in acquisition territory, but the business case for buying is out the window right now".
Korean Air is also slated for failure, with the firm's own boss warning that it was nearing the point where "we cannot 
guarantee survival".
British Airways and Ryanair cut all their services to Italy yesterday as the travel clampdown came into effect.

EVERY year there is always a 'race of the Festival' and up until yesterday morning it was undoubtedly the Betway 
Champion Chase (3.30pm). However, sadly reigning champion Altior was ruled out by Nicky Henderson after 
suffering a setback on Sunday and going lame.
He just couldn't recover in time and it's a real shame as it would have been fantastic to see him against two hugely 
exciting younger horses.
DEFI DU SEUIL is now the 11/10 favourite with Betfair and it's hard to argue against that after the season he's had.
A reappearance win in the Shloer Chase was followed by a gutsy success in the Betfair Tingle Creek, where he 
won the battle against the now retired Un De Sceaux.
He then faced the same rival in the Matchbook Clarence House Chase and it was the same result, although even 
more impressive thanks to an electric burst of speed in the home straight.
It's been a faultless campaign and Philip Hobbs' stable star has an excellent record at Cheltenham, winning on six 
of his eight visits to Prestbury Park, including the Triumph Hurdle and last year's JLT Novices' Chase (now the 
Marsh).
Blessed with both speed and stamina, he has all the attributes you are looking for with a top class two mile chaser 
and he is the one they all have to beat.
Hobbs runner Definitely the one in the Champion Chase BillEsdaile previews the Champion Chase
The Champion Chase is one of the few races missing from Willie Mullins' CV, but he looks to have a good chance 
of finally landing the prize with CHACUN POUR SOI.
The Rich Ricci-owned eight-year-old joined Mullins in 2016 but lots of niggles kept him off the track until he landed 
a beginners chase in fine style at Naas a year ago.
His main target was then the Grade One Ryanair Novice Chase at Punchestown, where he beat Defi Du Seuil and 
the previous month's Arkle winner Duc Des Genievres.
It was a hugely impressive performance, although it was at the end of a long, hard season for Hobbs' horse, so 
there was an excuse.
On his reappearance this term over Christmas at Leopardstown, this son of Policy Maker was beaten by A Plus 
Tard but like many of Mullins' horses he improved for the run.
He beat stablemate Min at the Dublin Racing Festival, showing a lot of speed and it was a performance that marked 
him down as a potential Champion Chase winner.
Speed and class are no problem at all, but there is a nagging worry that this will be his first start at Cheltenham so 
we don't know if he'll handle the track.
Comfortably Defi Du Seuil's biggest danger, he is no bigger than 6/4 and it promises to be an epic battle between 
the big two.
Paul Nicholls' Dynamite Dollars ran a promising race behind Altior in the Betfair Exchange Chase on his first start 
for over a year after suffering a setback last season.
He had some very good novice chase form last year so if he has improved from Newbury he has every chance of 
finishing in the top three.
However, I marginally prefer Alan King's SCEAU ROYAL who was third in this 12 months ago and has a good 
record at Cheltenham.
I'm sure connections would ideally want a sounder surface, but it was soft on this day last year so he can definitely 
handle it.
He hadn't been in the best of form so far this season, although his second to Altior last time was a step in the right 
direction and we know he is up to this level.
With only seven runners he isn't really an each-way proposition at 16/1 but you could back him for a top three finish, 
or without the big two.
Nicholls' other entry Politologue was second last year and he will enjoy the soft ground. Bar the big two, there isn't a 
huge amount between the rest of them.

Mar 11, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  British MP Nadine Dorries, a 
minister in the health department, has tested positive for coronavirus, she said in a statement on Tuesday, raising 
concerns about whether senior government figures have been infected."I can confirm I have tested positive for 
coronavirus... and have been self-isolating at home," said the Conservative MP.Health officials are now trying to 
trace where she contracted the virus and who she has been in contact with, she added.Six people have died in 
Britain from the virus, with more than 370 confirmed cases.Dorries, who helped craft the legislation to fight the bug, 
is the first British politician to be diagnosed with COVID-19.The Times reported that she had been in touch with 
hundreds of people, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson.She fell unwell on Friday while signing the document 
that declared coronavirus a notifiable disease, meaning companies could obtain insurance cover, said the paper, 
adding she was now believed to be on the road to recovery."I would like to thank... the wonderful NHS staff who 
have provided me with advice and support," she said, referring to Britain's National Health Service.The shock news 
is likely to increase calls to suspend parliament, despite the government's reluctance to do so in the middle of a 
health crisis.Her boss Matt Hancock, who is leading Britain's response, tweeted that he was "sorry to hear Nadine 
has tested positive for coronavirus."She has done the right thing by self isolating at home, and both NHS and PHE 
staff have been brilliant. 
We all wish her well as she recovers," he added. PHE refers to Public Health England."We will do all we can to 
keep people safe, based on the best possible science."Finance minister Rishi Sunak will on Wednesday unveil the 
government's first post-Brexit budget, with all eyes on emergency government measures to ease the economic pain 
from the coronavirus outbreak.He is expected to give the state-run National Health Service whatever it needs to 
help combat the virus and promise temporary support for businesses hit by cash flow issues.The Bank of England's 
incoming chief Andrew Bailey last week said UK-based companies would need help in the face of disruption to 
supplies caused by the virus.Budget airlines Ryanair and EasyJet said they will cancel all Italian flights until early 
April after the government ordered the entire country locked down because of the virus, leaving thousands of 
people unable to return home.

passengers is expected to reach 151 million from 154 million.

Mar 11, 2020( Financial Buzz: http://www.financialbuzz.com Delivered by Newstex)  Today, Deutsche Lufthansa 
AG announced plans to cancel 23,000 short, medium and long-haul flights over the coronavirus outbreak in the 
period from March 29, to April 24, 2020. Mostly affected by the capacity adjustments will be flight in Europe, Asia 
and the Middle East. Amongst most of the airline stock, shares of the company are tumbling amid the coronavirus 
fears. 
The German airline group made clear that additional cancellations in the next weeks are very likely to occur, due to 
the high spreading velocity of the COVID-19 coronavirus. Lufthansa said in a statement[1] on the Company's 
website, 'Further cancellations are expected in the coming weeks. Flight schedule adjustments for the period after 
25 April will be made at a later date.' After Italy went under a lock-down for the whole country, to prevent the virus 
from spreading, fears in Europe are broadly surging. 'Lufthansa passengers who are planning a trip in the coming 
weeks are recommended to check the current status of the respective flight on lufthansa.com before departure. 
Guests who have left their contact details with Lufthansa will be proactively informed if their flight is cancelled,' the 
airline group informed its customers. Only yesterday, American Airlines (AAL), the world's largest airline, 
announced plans to cut down both its international and domestic capacity. Delta Airlines (DAL) and Spirit Airline 
(SAVE) followed with similar actions. Air Canada (AC.TO) stated on Tuesday to cancel all flights from and to Italy, 
followed by British Airways Ryanair (RYAAY) as well as other carriers, and Qantas (QABSY) cut almost a quarter of 
its flights over the next half year period. [ 1]: https://newsroom.lufthansagroup.com/english/newsroom/all/lufthansa-

Mar 11, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  The only tourists outside 
Florence's majestic cathedral were a suitcase-laden couple rushing to leave Italy, where a nationwide virus 
shutdown is devastating an already fragile tourism industry."Everything's closed, we're going home," said German 
Alex Gross, 32, as his girlfriend nervously checked for updates on her phone. "That is, unless our flight gets 
cancelled."Many holidaymakers had already made their escape when Italy started succumbing last month to 
COVID-19, which has killed 631 people there so far and infected over 10,000, mainly in the country's wealthy 
north.It may be blue skies and sunshine from Sicily to the Alps, but the few remaining tourists now have two 
options: stay holed up in their hotels, relying on mini-bar snacks for dinner, or head home. "We've had over 90 
percent of bookings cancelled, even as far ahead as June," said Nicola, a hotel manager in Florence who did not 
want to give his last name."Though if we've not resolved the virus situation before then, empty rooms will be the 
least of our problems," he said.From the Colosseum to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the government has shuttered all 
museums and monuments, ordered restaurants and bars to close at 6pm, and told people to leave their homes only 
if strictly necessary until April 3.- 'Eerily quiet' -A slew of airlines are suspending flights to Italy -- including Air 
France, Air Canada, Ryanair, Easyjet and British Airways -- while many countries have imposed travel restrictions."I 
don't know if we can actually get out of Milan. 
Nobody really seems to know what's going on," said Texan Nick Manage, looking lost as he wandered around the 
northern city's central train station.Gone are the crowds at the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square, Rome's Spanish 
Steps, the Venice waterfront and Pompeii. Campo de' Fiori in Rome, where market traders shout all day and foreign 
students party all night, lies silent.Stefano Ruggiero, 48, who owns a perfume shop near Florence's Ponte Vecchio 
bridge, said the business had been going since 1911 but "this is the quietest the street has ever been"."Even after 
the terrible 1966 flood, when there was mud and devastation everywhere, there were more people".The carousel 
with its gold-gilded horses is still, the street musicians have disappeared. "It's eerily quiet," he said.Italian hoteliers' 
association Federalberghi says bookings are down at least 80 percent nationwide, with a loss estimated at 2.5 
billion euros.And that's not counting the losses from the rest of the tourism chain, from transport to restaurants and 
shops.The sector employs around one million people in the run-up to Easter, who now fear for their jobs.- Sacrifices 
-The government has promised 7.5 billion euros ($8.5 billion) to help mitigate economic fallout from the crisis, with 
the economy ministry saying that figure may rise to 10 billion euros or more.Crowded around television screens, 
Italians watched as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told them they have to make big sacrifices to stop the virus in 
its tracks and prevent Italy's health system collapsing under the strain.Hotel manager Nicola said that sacrifice 
would likely mean most hotels would be forced to close, "though some of the bigger structures like us may be asked 
Last tourists race home from virus-hit Italy
to remain open in case they're needed as makeshift hospitals". Agostino Ferrara, 52, who has owned the Spada 
restaurant in the centre of Florence for 28 years, says he has been forced to put a large part of his staff on forced 
leave after the 140 covers a day dropped to 20."I've never seen anything like this," he said softly, as the kitchen 
staff set about cleaning up the few pots and pans.I'm optimistic though, because we know people tend to forget 
horrid things," he added with a small smile."My hope is, we'll make it through this, and a few weeks, a few months 
later, everyone will return to Italy."In even greater numbers than before."

Mar 11, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Airline stocks have been 
under the pump lately, mainly due to the coronavirus-led concerns. With this dreaded COVID-19 no longer 
restricted to its country of origin (China), airlines across the world are taking various steps like cancelling flights in 
the face of the severely crippled air-travel demand. With this highly contagious disease spreading to countries like 
Italy, South Korea, Iran, the United States and Japan, many people are unwilling to fly in a bid to stay safe and 
avoid contracting the disease from a fellow passenger.Airline Stocks Bear the BruntWhile it is true that the rapid 
spread of the novel coronavirus, which has claimed more than 4,000[1] lives apart from infecting in excess of 
113,000 people worldwide, rattled almost every nook and corner of the investing space, the airline industry suffered 
a severe jolt with many carriers 'reporting 50% no-shows across several markets' per IATA.Evidently, passenger 
traffic growth across the globe in January 2020 was the slowest in a decade due to the above-mentioned health 
peril. The traffic readings in the following months are likely to be worse as in January, the coronavirus was only 
confined to China and was still considered an epidemic.The sorry state of affairs for airlines is well-reflected in the 
price performance of the ZacksAirline[2]industry. 
In the past month, the industry has plunged 33.2% compared with the S...00 Index's loss of 18.7%.Wake-Up Call to 
Airlines as Demand DwindlesWith air-travel demand diminishingdue to the rapid spread of the disease, airlines from 
all corners of the globe are trimming their capacity. With Italy being very badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak, 
European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] lowered its 2020 traffic forecast by 3 million to 151 million. Notably, 
Ryanair and British Airways suspended all their flights to/ from Italy following the entire nation on lockdown.Airline 
companies based in the United States too have resorted to various measures for combatting the coronavirus-
induced sharp drop in demand. For instance, Delta Air Lines DAL[4] decided to cut its system capacity by 15 points. 
While international capacity is trimmed 20-25%, the measure sees a 10-15 % reduction on the domestic front. 
American Airlines AAL[5] also walked the same path in this low-demand scenario.Management at this Fort Worth, 
TX carrier stated that its international capacity during the peak summer season will witness a 10% cut. Moreover, 
domestic capacity for April will be trimmed to the tune of 7.5%. American Airlines like United Airlines UAL[6] and 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[7] suspended its forecast for first-quarter 2020 and the full year as well.Play Video[8] 
Opportunity Knocks for Intelligent InvestorsThat the coronavirus-led current stalemate is adding to the airline woes, 
can be gauged from the fact that even the recent slump in the oil prices failed to provide some relief to the 
beleaguered battered stocks.However, the prevalent drab scenario should not kill one's investment appetite. At a 
Coronavirus Crisis Crashes Airlines: Should You Buy the Dips?
time when share prices of the airline stocks have declined sharply over the coronavirus-caused concerns, this 
creates an outlet of opportunity to make a killing by acquiring stocks with high potential at the current depressed 
prices.A sensible move would be to buy the beaten-down stocks that are set to gain traction from the encouraging 
fundamentals.3 Beaten-Down Airline Stocks to BuyAzul AZUL[9] is one of the largest airlines in Brazil in terms of 
departures and destinations covered.The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Even though Azul's shares 
have declined more than 42% in the past month, analysts are still bullish on the stock and that sentiment can be 
figured out from the 4.4% upward revision of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings over the past 90 
days. Moreover, current-year earnings per share are projected to increase above 100%, which is way above its 
industry's expected rise. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[10].Ryanair Holdings is 
based in Ireland. Even though shares of this Zacks #1 Ranked carrier have declined 19.2% in the past month, the 
fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 16.4% upward over the past 90 
days, signifies that analysts have not lost confidence in the Ryanair stock. Moreover, current-quarter earnings per 
share are projected to grow in excess of 100%, which is way above its industry's anticipated rise.Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[11] is based in Miramar, FL. This ultra low-cost carrier currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Even though the 
stock has shed more than 48% of value in the past month, analysts are still optimistic about the stock as that can be 
comprehended from the 11.8% upward revision of the Zacks Consensus for 2020 earnings over the past 90 days. 
Moreover, current-year earnings per share are projected to improve in excess of 7%, ahead of its industry's 
estimated rise.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, 
it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's 
first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades

Mar 11, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  European Central Bank President 
Christine Lagarde talks to German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz during a meeting of European Union Finance 
Ministers in Eurogroup format at the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels, Monday, Feb. 17, 2020. (AP 
Photo/Francisco Seco)FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Suddenly staring recession in the face, European leaders 
are lining up an array of tax breaks, financial support for companies and likely central bank measures in the hope of 
preventing the coronavirus outbreak from dealing long-term damage to the economy. Expectations have grown that 
European Central Bank officials will announce more monetary stimulus when they meet Thursday, including an 
interest rate cut and corporate bond purchases aimed at supporting business borrowing. 
 And the European Commission says it plans to bring forward existing funding to create a 25 billion-euro ($28 
billion) investment fund to support the health care system, businesses and labor market measures. Yet any such 
actions will likely be more damage limitation than cure. Monetary stimulus and government spending can spur 
demand for goods. But the coronavirus deals a shock from the supply side by closing businesses and making 
people stay home, highlighted by Italy's dramatic decision this week to limit travel and public gatherings across the 
country. Lower interest rates or tax cuts cannot solve that. Meanwhile, action to help the 19 countries that use the 
euro currency faces constraints from the lack of a large central treasury, a hurdle other large economies like the 
U.S. and China do not face.  'The world is facing a medical emergency that monetary and fiscal policy cannot fix,' 
said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg private bank.  The best policymakers can do for the 
economy is to prevent the virus from dealing prolonged damage even after the outbreak ends, to keep small- and 
medium-sized companies that provide most of the jobs in the economy from going out of business due to a short-
term issue beyond their control.  Among the most affected are companies involved in travel. The number of people 
going through European airports is expected to fall by 187 million this year. Lufthansa said it would cut up to half of 
its flights from April. Ryanair suspended all flights to and from Italy. Exhibition centers have seen trade fairs 
postponed, hitting hotels,restaurants and cabdrivers. Football matches are taking place in empty stadiums. (Ad) 
Free guide reveals alternative income source frequently tapped by some of the world's wealthiest investors.The 
investment fund announced Tuesday night by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is drawn from 
the existing EU budget. The 25 billion size of the fund is only around 0.1% of the annual 18.8 trillion euro ($20.7 
trillion) EU economy. Von der Leyen said national leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French 
President Emmanuel Macron agreed during a video conference Tuesday to 'use all the tools at our disposal so that 
the European economy weathers this storm." That includes being flexible in EU rules limiting debt and coming up 
with clear guidelines on permissible state aid to companies. 'We will make sure that state aid can flow to the 
Facing recession, Europe grasps for ways to limit damage
companies that need it,' she said.  At the national level, Italy, which has been hit hardest by far by the virus 
outbreak, has already announced a 7.5 billion-euro ($8.5 billion) package of measures including tax credits for 
companies that report a 25% drop in revenues.  Economists at Berenberg bank expect Britain, not a member of the 
eurozone but an important trade partner, to announce fiscal stimulus of about 1% of GDP when the budget is 
announced Thursday. Even Germany is softening its longstanding opposition to increasing government spending to 
boost growth. The cabinet has discussed a package of measures including 3.1 billion euros in extra investment 
spending per year from 2021 to 2024. That is only 0.1% of GDP but experts say it's a step in the right direction and 
can always be scaled up. The German government meanwhile agreed to make it easier for companies to put 
workers on shortened hours. The short-time work program is credited with limiting job losses during the Great 
Recession in 2009 and with speeding the rebound afterward, since companies kept their workers on and did not 
need to reassemble a trained factory workforce. The government is also considering tax relief for companies if their 
sales fall suddenly. The European Central Bank, which didn't join the Federal Reserve in an emergency rate cut on 
March 3, is now expected to change course at a meeting of its 25-member governing council on Thursday. It could 
cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory, to minus 0.6% from minus 0.5%, effectively pushing banks to lend 
more money. The ECB could also raise its current program of bond purchases from 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a 
month to as much as 40 billion euros ($44 billion) a month and focus more on bonds issued by companies, which 
would directly try to lower borrowing costs for the private sector. The central bank could also issue more cheap, 
long-term credit to banks on the condition the money is loaned to businesses.  Yet all this can only 'limit the 
damage to demand," said Schmieding. He estimates that the eurozone economy could shrink 0.4% in the first 
quarter and 0.5% in the second, putting it in recession. A rebound in the second half would still leave the economy 
slightly smaller for the year. Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics, said Europe might be 
only beginning to face the need for new investment and financial aid. 'This is a broadly right and a welcome 
response limiting the hit to household incomes and firm profits,' he said. 'But we continue to think that more will be 
needed, once the fallout from the current economic shock becomes clearer.'

European countries attempted to shield themselves from a severe coronavirus outbreak in Italy on Tuesday with 
travel bans and warnings, as they introduced ever stricter measures to contain their own domestic epidemics.
Austria announced an entry ban for anyone arriving from Italy, and warned its citizens against travelling anywhere 
in the neighbouring country, which has gone into a national lockdown to try and slow the spread of Covid-19.
Serbia and Malta similarly said they would no longer allow in arrivals from Italy.
After visiting Italy last weekend, the president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, put himself into pre-
emptive, self-imposed quarantine.
In a statement, the Italian politician said he would be fulfilling his functions from his residence in Brussels.
European Union leaders will hold a video conference at 5 pm (1600 GMT) to coordinate efforts to respond to the 
outbreak, which has now been reported in all 27 member states.
Airlines joined the efforts to limit the international spread of the Italy outbreak.
British Airways said it was suspending all routes to and from Italy, which has seen by the worst outbreak in Europe, 
with over 460 deaths.
Ryanair will from Wednesday suspend all Italian domestic flights and all international flights serving Italy from 
Friday, both until April 8.
Europe imposes new travel bans after Italy 's national lockdown
Denmark announced that flights from areas badly affected by coronavirus, including parts of Italy, would not be 
given permission to land, while Austrian Airlines stopped its flights to the northern Italian cities of Venice, Milan and 
Bologna.
The fears of the virus and travel bans have badly affected airlines, with Norwegian the latest to announce flight 
cancellations. The carrier said it was cancelling an estimated 3,000 flights from now until mid-June - about 15 per 
cent of its flying capacity.
Germany confirmed on Tuesday that the virus had reached all 16 of its federal states, after authorities in Saxony-
Anhalt announced their first infections.
Health Minister Jens Spahn on Tuesday appealed for an all-hands-on-deck response to the new coronavirus.
In the Bild tabloid, Spahn called the outbreak "a major challenge for us as a whole society ... The virus will change 
our everyday life. We can only do it together."
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Switzerland rose to 476 on Tuesday, an increase of 52 per cent on 
the previous day, the Federal Health Office said.
The outbreak originated in central China in December and has spread rapidly across the globe. About 110,000 
people have become infected around the world, according to the World Health Organization, of which over 3,800 
have died.
A German woman on vacation in Northern Cyprus was diagnosed with coronavirus, state news agency Anadolu 
reported on Tuesday, the first such case in the Turkish-administered part of the divided island.
Cultural and sporting life on the continent ground to a standstill in more places on Tuesday, as Poland and Slovakia 
joined Italy in banning all sports and cultural events. Austria said all indoor events with more than 100 participants 
would be stopped.
Slovakia's measures would be in place for 14 days. The ban in Poland did not have an end date, and will cover 
professional football games and concerts, among others. However, theatres, opera houses, philharmonic concert 
halls or art galleries will be exempt.
Popstar Madonna announced she was cancelling two upcoming Paris tour dates on March 10 and 11 after the 
French government banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people.
Organizers of the Lit.Cologne fair in western Germany said this year's 12-day festival would not take place. Over 
200 exhibitors and 100,000 visitors had been expected to attend what is one of Europe's biggest literature festivals.
In the Vatican, St Peter's Square and St Peter's Basilica have been closed to the public due to the coronavirus 
crisis.
The Vatican pharmacy and the supermarket will remain open, but other shops and the canteen for staff will close, a 
statement said.
Polish President Andrzej Duda announced he will refrain from holding large conventions as part of his campaign 
ahead of elections in May.
The "risk that the coronavirus may spread is is too big. I don't want to endanger people who come to these 
meetings," Duda said late Monday evening.
In the Czech Republic, all schools are being shut and all events with more than 100 participants are being banned.
The leaders of Northern Ireland's devolved government have cancelled a planned visit to the United States 
coinciding with St Patrick's Day celebrations.
Europe imposes new travel bans after Italy 's national lockdown

Italy on Tuesday recorded its deadliest day of the novel coronavirus outbreak, with its toll jumping by 168, as 
airlines halted flights and neighbouring countries clamped down on borders of the worst-hit country outside of 
China.Chinese leader Xi Jinping meanwhile sought to ease concerns in the country where the virus was first 
detected in December, making his first visit to the epicentre of Wuhan and declaring the spread in the central city 
and Hubei province to be "basically curbed". Italy will implement a nationwide lockdown in a desperate bid to stem

than a decade on Monday.Official figures showed daily infections in China are at their lowest level since record-
keeping began in January, with 19 new infections and 17 deaths recorded on Tuesday, after a similar flatlining of

total number of deaths outside China past 1,000, hitting 1,115, according an AFP tally.

areas to undergo quarantines Photo: AFP / Philip FONG China remains the hardest hit overall with more than 
80,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths out of a global total of 117,339 cases and 4,251 deaths across 105 countries 
and territories, the tally showed. Reflecting the differing stages of the outbreak, China relaxed some of its most 
severe restrictions in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, at the same moment as several European 
countries went on full alert mode.A slew of airlines announced they would cut all flights to Italy for the next few

bustle and traffic, some residents were confused as to whether they were even allowed to leave their homes for 
everyday tasks like shopping.The confusion forced the government to clarify its decree and warn against panic-
buying.Pope Francis also seemed to muddy the waters, holding a mass in which he urged priests to go out and visit 
the sick -- something specifically discouraged by Conte.Governments elsewhere in Europe were also scrambling to 
balance their responses between restrictions and pushing out accurate information to avoid panic.In Geneva, the

reports have suggested President Donald Trump could be vulnerable after several senior Republicans quarantined 
themselves because they had been in contact with a virus sufferer.The White House insisted Trump had not been 
in contact with anyone confirmed to have COVID-19, but Vice-President Mike Pence did little to dampen concern 
when he conceded he did not know whether the president had been tested.There are concerns that the US could 
become another hotspot, with at least 26 deaths and 605 confirmed infections so far.Trump said he would propose 
"very substantial" economic measures to Congress on Tuesday including tax relief and aid for workers in the gig 
economy who worry about calling in sick.In New York, the UN closed its headquarters to the public, while major US 
universities have been forced to cancel classes and move lessons online.

European countries attempted to block a severe coronavirus outbreak in Italy from spreading any further on 
Tuesday with travel bans and warnings, as they introduced ever stricter measures to contain their own domestic 
epidemics.
Speaking during a video conference of European Union leaders late on Tuesday, European Council President 
Charles Michel urged the continent to coordinate its response to the crisis.
"The virus is spreading in all member states," said Michel. "I think therefore we should try to coordinate as much as 
possible and see where we can do more together."
His remarks were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday evening, who tweeted that Europe 
should prevent instability and do everything necessary to protect people's health and the economy.
Multiple countries - including Austria, Malta, Serbia and Spain - banned flights from Italy, which has seen by the 
worst outbreak in Europe, with more than 460 deaths and has gone into nationwide lockdown in a bid to slow the 
spread of Covid-19.
Denmark said it had banned flights from badly affected areas, including parts of Italy, while Austrian Airlines 
stopped flights to the northern Italian cities of Venice, Milan and Bologna.
Serbia, which now has five confirmed cases, on Tuesday refused to permit 10 travellers to disembark from their 
plane from Bergamo and returned them to Italy. Croatia, with 14 cases, said it would quarantine all arrivals from 
Italy.

Spain raised its own concerns after registering a sharp jump in cases to 1,600, up 400 from the day before, and 
announced it would close its parliament until further notice.
The virus has now been reported in all 27 member states. France confirmed 372 new coronavirus cases in the last 
24 hours, taking the total to 1,784, with 33 deaths. Britain confirmed an additional 54 cases, taking the country's 
total to 373, including six deaths.
Swiss authorities confirmed the number of cases in the country rose to 476, an increase of 52 per cent on the 
previous day.
A German woman on vacation in Northern Cyprus was diagnosed with coronavirus, state news agency Anadolu 
reported, the first such case in the Turkish-administered part of the divided island.
Airlines joined the efforts to limit the spread from Italy, with British Airways announcing it was cancelling all 
Tuesday's flights to and from the country.
Other airlines went one step further, with Ryanair suspending flights to and from Italy until April 8 and Air France 
and Easyjet until April 3.
Airlines have been badly hit by travel bans, with Norwegian the latest to announce flight cancellations. The carrier 
said it was cancelling an estimated 3,000 flights from now until mid-June - about 15 per cent of its flying capacity.
On the Spanish island of Mallorca, hoteliers said they were eyeing a dramatic slump in Easter bookings with 
concern.
Germany confirmed on Tuesday that the virus had reached all 16 of its federal states, after authorities in Saxony-
Anhalt announced their first infections.
Figures from the six German states worst hit showed the virus continuing to spread across the country, with 
authorities confirming 200 new cases within a day.
Health Minister Jens Spahn on Tuesday appealed for an all-hands-on-deck response to the new coronavirus.
The outbreak originated in central China in December and has spread rapidly, with about 110,000 people infected 
worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, of which over 3,800 have died.
Cultural and sporting life on the continent ground to a standstill in more places on Tuesday, as Poland and Slovakia 
joined Italy in banning all sports and cultural events. Austria and the Czech Republic stopped all indoor events with 
more than 100 participants.
Slovakia's measures are in place for 14 days, whereas the ban in Poland did not have an end date, and spans 
professional football games and concerts, among others. However, theatres, opera houses, philharmonic concert 
halls or art galleries are exempt.
Pop star Madonna announced she was cancelling two Paris concerts on March 10 and 11 after the French 
government banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people.
Organizers of the Lit.Cologne fair in western Germany said this year's festival would not take place. Berlin's Senate 
said it was cancelling all state-owned theatre, opera and concert events until the end of the Easter break.
In the Vatican, St Peter's Square and St Peter's Basilica have been closed to the public due to the crisis.
Greece is set to temporarly close its schools. In Poland, several universities cancelled classes and other events 
while President Andrzej Duda said he would refrain from organising large gatherings as he campaigned ahead of 
May's election.

Poland's GDP growth rate this year may be reduced by 0.5-1.3 percentage points due to the coronavirus, 
Development Minister Jadwiga Emilewicz said according to PAP newswire.
The country plans measures to help firms counter the effects of the virus, possibly including cheap credit, bank 
guarantees, or waiving fees for later payment of social insurance premiums, Emilewicz said.

Mar 10, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Italy's transport 
links with the outside were thrown into chaos Tuesday -- but not shut down totally -- in the wake of the 
government's drastic restrictions on travel to contain the coronavirus.British Airways cancelled all its Italian flights 
Tuesday while low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air said that they would be scrapping flights from Italian airports 
until early April.The Spanish government said Tuesday that it was suspending all air traffic from Italy for two weeks 
while Austria said it would be introducing new restrictions on arrivals from Italy.However, at Rome's main Fiumicino 
airport there were still services running to destinations in Europe and beyond on Tuesday afternoon, as well as to 
domestic Italian destinations. Disruption, but no complete shutdown Photo: AFP / MIGUEL MEDINA Flights were 
also still taking off from the smaller Ciampino airport, used mostly by low-cost carriers. Tourists welcomed the 
remaining opportunities to leave, although they were facing longer stays than anticipated."We are going to be able 
to go back because we got a text from our flight," Mina, a 58-year-old Indian national, told AFP next to Rome's 
deserted Colosseum. 
She and her family were awaiting further information from their airline, she said.The ADR company which runs 
Rome's airports said that all arriving passengers and all those heading for destinations outside the Schengen zone 
"will undergo health checks" and have to go through thermal scanners to try to detect any potential fever. Tourists 
are facing longer stays in Italy than planned Photo: AFP / Alberto PIZZOLI As for rail travel, mask-wearing police at 
Rome's main Termini train station were checking passengers' reasons for travel and making sure everybody was 
keeping the recommended distance of one metre away from each other.But the departures board was showing no 
sign of any cancellations.Klemen Gartner, a 22-year-old seminarian from Slovenia, said that he was trying to get 
back home, "somewhere I can understand the language". 'You're foreign? Go, go!" Photo: AFP / Miguel MEDINA 
He said that when station staff realised he wasn't Italian, he was told: "You're foreign? Go, go!" and waved 
through.The service for Venice via Florence was only sparsely occupied but running nonetheless, with no checks 
for passengers on disembarkation at Florence, an AFP journalist reported.Italy's rail links with neighbouring 
countries are under more strain, with the Thello company cancelling its night services between Paris and Venice, as 
well as daytime trains between Milan and Marseille, until early April.France's national train company SNCF said on 
Tuesday it was "waiting for advice" about how to proceed regarding its services to Italy.Since late February French 
staff on cross-border SNCF trains have been getting off before the Italian border and being replaced by Italian 
colleagues.Austria's national OeBB company has implementing similar measures for its staff.OeBB has already 
cancelled its night trains to several Italian cities and said that further changes to its daytime schedules may come in 
the following days.A spokeswoman for Germany's Deutsche Bahn said that the only service it had linking it to Italy,

between Munich and Venice, has also been suspended.On Italy's road borders the situation seemed more relaxed 
on Tuesday afternoon.Cars were crossing the frontier with neighbouring Slovenia in both directions on Tuesday 
afternoon, an AFP journalist reported.Italians in the area around the city of Trieste often make the short journey into 
Slovenia to do their shopping and take advantage of cheaper fuel.But late Tuesday, Slovenia's government 
announced it would close its border with Italy.Austria said it was putting tough new restrictions on passengers 
arriving from Italy. On the land border between both countries, Austrian police were reported to be stopping people 
crossing from Italy to take their temperatures.The wave of cancelled trips is raising fears for Italy's tourism sector, 
which accounts for 13 percent of GDP.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) lowered its total passenger estimate for FY2020 after it was forced to suspend most of 
its flights to and from Italy, one of its most important destinations, as the government imposed a total lockdown of 
the entire country to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease.
The Irish-based budget carrier reduced its passenger target to 151 million from the previous estimate of 154 million. 
The company said that it does not expect the traffic reductions to have a material impact on full-year results but it

EU to stop 'ghost flights' in coronavirus fightback
EU to stop 'ghost flights' in coronavirus fightback

Mar 10, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  The EU is to act "very rapidly" 
to help airlines struggling from the new coronavirus outbreak by proposing a law to stop "ghost flights" to keep 
airport slots, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday."The coronavirus outbreak had a 
major impact on European and international aviation industry. We see that the situation is deteriorating on a daily 
basis and traffic is expected to decline further," she said."This is why the Commission will put forward very rapidly 
legislation regarding the so-called airport slots.... it will also decrease emissions by avoiding the so-called 'ghost 
flights' when airlines fly almost empty planes simply to keep their slot," she said."Slots" are reserved take-off or 
landing authorisations that airports allocate to airlines. 
Currently, if an airline does not operate a flight in its allocated slot it can lose it to a competitor.With the abrupt drop-
off in passenger numbers due to the expanding coronavirus crisis, many airlines have taken to flying empty planes -
- "ghost flights" -- to ensure they do not lose their slots.Von der Leyen's proposal means the Commission would put 
forward an emergency EU draft law to allow airlines to keep those slots without operating ghost flights while the 
virus emergency goes on.Such legislation would have to go to the European Parliament for adoption, and then to 
the European Council representing the EU's 27 member states for approval.The Commission president said the 
measure would be temporary.- Big economic hit -The initiative, she said, was just one example of a raft of 
measures the EU executive was looking at to alleviate the impact of the new coronavirus, which is proving both 
deadly and economically damaging as it spreads. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) last week 
estimated that losses in revenue for airlines due to the new coronavirus could range from $63 billion (55 billion 
euros) to $113 billion, depending on whether the spread of the virus was contained.It and the European Airport 
Coordinators Association have recommended that rules governing slots be suspended while the industry copes with 
the sudden collapse in passenger demand and the axing of services to the worst-hit countries and regions.The 
European Union has already enacted such temporary suspensions in the past, during the SARS epidemic in 2003 
and in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.With Italy declaring a nationwide 
lockdown to slow the virus's spread, European airlines Ryanair, Norwegian and British Airways have announced 
cancelled flights. German airline Lufthansa said last week it will slash its capacity in half in the coming weeks 
because of the "drastic decline" in bookings.

Mar 10, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Italy's transport links with the 
outside were thrown into chaos Tuesday -- but not shut down totally -- in the wake of the government's drastic 
restrictions on travel to contain the coronavirus.British Airways cancelled all its Italian flights Tuesday while low-cost 
carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air said that they would be scrapping flights from Italian airports until early April.The 
Spanish government said Tuesday that it was suspending all air traffic from Italy for two weeks while Austria said it 
would be introducing new restrictions on arrivals from Italy.However, at Rome's main Fiumicino airport there were 
still services running to destinations in Europe and beyond on Tuesday afternoon, as well as to domestic Italian 
destinations.Flights were also still taking off from the smaller Ciampino airport, used mostly by low-cost 
carriers.Tourists welcomed the remaining opportunities to leave, although they were facing longer stays than 
anticipated. "We are going to be able to go back because we got a text from our flight," Mina, a 58-year-old Indian 
national, told AFP next to Rome's deserted Colosseum.She and her family were awaiting further information from 
their airline, she said.The ADR company which runs Rome's airports said that all arriving passengers and all those 
heading for destinations outside the Schengen zone "will undergo health checks" and have to go through thermal 
scanners to try to detect any potential fever.- 'You're foreign?
 Go, go!' -As for rail travel, mask-wearing police at Rome's main Termini train station were checking passengers' 
reasons for travel and making sure everybody was keeping the recommended distance of one metre away from 
each other.But the departures board was showing no sign of any cancellations.Klemen Gartner, a 22-year-old 
seminarian from Slovenia, said that he was trying to get back home, "somewhere I can understand the 
language".He said that when station staff realised he wasn't Italian, he was told: "You're foreign? Go, go!" and 
waved through.The service for Venice via Florence was only sparsely occupied but running nonetheless, with no 
checks for passengers on disembarkation at Florence, an AFP journalist reported.Italy's rail links with neighbouring 
countries are under more strain, with the Thello company cancelling its night services between Paris and Venice, as 
well as daytime trains between Milan and Marseille, until early April.France's national train company SNCF said on 
Tuesday it was "waiting for advice" about how to proceed regarding its services to Italy. Since late February French 
staff on cross-border SNCF trains have been getting off before the Italian border and being replaced by Italian 
colleagues. Austria's national OeBB company has implementing similar measures for its staff. OeBB has already 
cancelled its night trains to several Italian cities and said that further changes to its daytime schedules may come in 
the following days.A spokeswoman for Germany's Deutsche Bahn said that the only service it had linking it to Italy, 
between Munich and Venice, has also been suspended.On Italy's road borders the situation seemed more relaxed 
on Tuesday afternoon.Cars were crossing the frontier with neighbouring Slovenia in both directions on Tuesday 
Italy 's transport links in chaos in virus crackdown
afternoon, an AFP journalist reported.Italians in the area around the city of Trieste often make the short journey into 
Slovenia to do their shopping and take advantage of cheaper fuel.But late Tuesday, Slovenia's government 
announced it would close its border with Italy.Austria said it was putting tough new restrictions on passengers 
arriving from Italy. On the land border between both countries, Austrian police were reported to be stopping people 
crossing from Italy to take their temperatures.The wave of cancelled trips is raising fears for Italy's tourism sector, 
which accounts for 13 percent of GDP.

BP and Royal Dutch Shell led the bluechip fallers as the oil rout led UK stocks to their worst day in more than a 
decade.
The FTSE 100 dropped 7.7 per cent, its fifth biggest daily decline on record.
Premier Oil more than halved on expectations that shareholders would vote against a rights issue needed to fund 
its $500m acquisition of North Sea assets from BP, forcing the explorer to seek covenant waivers from its lenders.
Tullow Oil, Energean Oil & Gas and Cairn Energy were also hit as analysts said they would need to take action to 
preserve balance sheet strength.
William Hill held steady after the Done brothers, owners of rival bookmaker Betfred, disclosed a 3.03 per cent stake, 
having crossed through a disclosure threshold last week.
Cineworld faded even after its biggest shareholder, Global City Theatres, sold a stake of about 8 per cent and 
refinanced a margin loan facility to delink it from the cinema operator's share price.
Analysts welcomed the news as removing an overhang for the stock.
Ryanair was among the more resilient of the airline stocks as the promise of cheaper fuel combined with the effects 
of an upgrade from Credit Suisse, which forecast an industry shakeout. Bryce Elder

Mar 10, 2020( Medical Xpress: http://medicalxpress.com Delivered by Newstex)  The Spanish government said 
Tuesday it was suspending all air traffic from Italy for two weeks over coronavirus fears, the official state bulletin 
said.  "The measure applies to all direct flights from airports in Italy to Spain," it said in a measure which would 
come into force at midnight (2300 GMT) and remain in force until March 25.  The only exceptions to the ban are 
government aircraft as well as planes carrying medical or humanitarian aid[1], it said.  The move came as Italy 
ordered a national lockdown to try and curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus epidemic that has so far infected 
more than 9,000 people, killing 463.  Spain itself has also seen a spike in cases in the last 24 hours, with 1,622 
infections and 35 deaths.  In terms of flight arrivals, Italy is the third largest market for Spain, with more than 
106,000 flights arriving in 2019 carrying some 16 million passengers and accounting for around 9.0 percent of 
Spain's international traffic, the bulletin said.  It made no mention of flights to Italy. Explore further Ryanair cuts

Virus death toll soars in locked-down Italy as pace slows in China

Locked-down Italy on Tuesday recorded its deadliest day of the novel coronavirus outbreak, with its toll jumping by 
168, as airlines halted flights and neighbouring countries clamped down on borders of the worst-hit country outside 
of China. Chinese leader Xi Jinping meanwhile sought to ease concerns in the country where the virus was first 
detected in December, making his first visit to the epicentre of Wuhan and declaring the spread in the central city[1] 
and Hubei province to be "basically curbed". On the world's financial markets, stocks and oil bounced back on 
hopes of US economic stimulus measures, after suffering their biggest one-day losses in more than a decade on 
Monday. Official figures showed daily infections in China are at their lowest level since record-keeping began in 
January, with 19 new infections and 17 deaths recorded on Tuesday, after a similar flatlining of cases in South 
Korea. 
 By contrast, Europe's outbreak surged, with Italy's toll rising to 631 dead from the COVID-19 disease caused by 
the virus, with 10,149 infected in just over two weeks.  Tuesday's toll pushed the total number of deaths outside 
China past 1,000, hitting 1,115, according an AFP tally. China remains the hardest hit overall with more than 80,000 
cases and over 3,000 deaths out of a global total of 117,339 cases and 4,251 deaths across 105 countries and 
territories, the tally showed. Reflecting the differing stages of the outbreak, China relaxed some of its most severe 
restrictions in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, at the same moment as several European countries 
went on full alert mode.  A slew of airlines announced they would cut all flights to Italy for the next few weeks, 
including Air France, Air Canada, Ryanair and Easyjet. A number of European countries also announced the 
closure of schools and bans on mass public events. Slovenia said it was closing its border with Italy, while Austria 
announced bans on trains and flights to the neighbouring country. In the Middle East, Iran registered 54 new 
deaths—the highest single-day toll so far in the country with the third deadliest outbreak in the world. A total of 291 
people have now died in the Islamic Republic.  In Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo confirmed its first 
coronavirus case in the capital Kinshasa, a city of more than 10 million people. The news comes as the DRC hopes 
to declare next month an end to the 19-month Ebola epidemic that has killed 2,264 people. 'Just the beginning' 
Strict lockdowns and travel restrictions were apparently successful in China but faced a rocky start in Italy, a 
country of 60 million people where Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte told residents they should travel only for the 
most urgent work or health reasons.  While squares in Milan and Rome were emptied of their usual bustle and 
traffic, some residents were confused as to whether they were even allowed to leave their homes for everyday 
tasks like shopping. The confusion forced the government to clarify its decree and warn against panic-buying.  Pope 
Francis also seemed to muddy the waters, holding a mass in which he urged priests to go out and visit the sick—
Virus death toll soars in locked-down Italy as pace slows in China
something specifically discouraged by Conte.  Governments elsewhere in Europe were also scrambling to balance 
their responses between restrictions and pushing out accurate information to avoid panic.  In Geneva, the World 
Trade Organization said it would suspend all meetings until March 20 after one of its staff members contracted the 
virus. Sport schedules have been wrecked across Europe, with Barcelona's Champions League football match 
against Napoli next Wednesday the latest to fall prey to the virus—it will be played behind closed doors.  In a rare 
glimmer of positive news, the remaining guests at a hotel in Spain's Canary Islands on lockdown left the building 
after a 14-day quarantine, to the cheers and applause of hotel workers and medical staff.  But French President 
Emmanuel Macron provided a reminder of Europe's plight, warning that his country was "just at the beginning" of its 
outbreak, Europe's second most acute with 1,784 infected and 33 dead. Officials at risk In the United States, 
reports have suggested President Donald Trump could be vulnerable after several senior Republicans quarantined 
themselves because they had been in contact with a virus sufferer. The White House insisted Trump had not been 
in contact with anyone confirmed to have COVID-19, but Vice-President Mike Pence did little to dampen concern 
when he conceded he did not know whether the president had been tested. There are concerns that the US could 
become another hotspot, with at least 26 deaths and 605 confirmed infections so far. Trump said he would propose 
"very substantial" economic measures to Congress on Tuesday including tax relief and aid for workers in the gig 
economy who worry about calling in sick. In New York, the UN closed its headquarters to the public, while major US 
universities have been forced to cancel classes and move lessons online. On the West Coast—where most of the 
US deaths have occurred—the Grand Princess cruise ship has docked at California's port of Oakland, for more 
than 2,400 passengers to be taken into treatment or placed in quarantine, in a delicate, days-long operation.

Mar 10, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  BEIJING (AP) — The Latest on 
the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the globe (all times local): 10:35 p.m. Major European airlines are canceling 
flights to and from Italy after the country put a nationwide lock down on travel British Airways said Tuesday it is 
canceled all flights and could not confirm the status of future flights.  Air France is reducing its traffic to Italy by half 
for all of March, and suspending flights to Hong Kong and Taipei until March 29. Air France has canceled 3,600 
flights this month. Ryanair, Europe's busiest airline, canceled all international flights to and from Italy from Saturday 
until April 9. The carrier said passengers currently in Italy could fly home on one of the flights operating up to Friday

reported its first death of a person with the new virus, an 89-year-old woman with underlying medical problems who 
died in a Casablanca hospital. (Ad) The 5G technology revolution has now arrived -- and with it comes a unique 
megatrend investing opportunity. This Special Investor's Report reveals the names of four companies poised to 
take advantage of the 5G technology boom. Savvy investors should strongly consider putting these 5G stocks on 
their watchlist. It was only the second confirmed death in Africa, after one in Egypt over the weekend. The woman 
in Morocco had arrived from Italy, and was one of just two people in Morocco confirmed to have the virus. Italy now 
has more coronavirus cases than anywhere but China, registering 9,172 infections with 463 deaths, and officials 
say they expect many, many more. ___ 10 p.m. Hollywood continued to reschedule its upcoming movie releases 
due to the coronavirus, as Sony Pictures on Tuesday announced that it's moving 'Peter Rabbit 2' to August. 'Peter 
Rabbit 2' had been set to hit U.K. and European theaters on March 27, and open in the U.S. on April 3. Instead,

spread in his northern region. Regional governor Atilio Fontana told private TV channel La7 on Tuesday that the 
mayors of 12 provincial capitals agreed to request orders that would close non-essential stores and shut down local 
public transportation.  Fontana says the requested measures would not impact grocery stores and other activities 
deemed essential for the public good. He says mandatory closures that could cause ''damage to the collectivity or 
the economy'' also won't be imposed. The governor didn't provide new figures on virus cases in Italy. A national 
tally usually is provided later in the day.  Lombardy has been hardest hit by the virus outbreak in the country.  
Fontana said stricter measures to limit travel and public events ''are justified by the fact that on the one hand, 
contagion is growing, and by the fact that the (original) red zone where they observed the most rigid measures, the 
trend is reversing,'' ___ 8:10 p.m. Europe's airports say they expect 187 million fewer passengers this year due to 
the virus outbreak, which is 'turning into a shock of unprecedented proportions for our industry.' The ACI Europe, 
which represents the sector, estimated Tuesday that the outbreak will mean a 13.5% drop in airport passengers in 
the first quarter alone. That translates to 1.32 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in lost revenue. Airports in Italy, where the 
government has imposed a travel lockdown on the whole country, are the most affected. Scores of nations have 
issued travel advisories urging their citizens to avoid Italy. Olivier Jankovec, the head of ACI Europe, says 'what 
they are now bracing for is a total collapse in air connectivity and the prospect of losing most of their revenues.'  He 
called on the Italian government to provide emergency financial support, and said that might be necessary across 
the EU if more authorities clamp down on travel. ___ 7:45 p.m. In a dramatic move to keep the coronavirus from

Sebastian Kurz said Tuesday that exceptions will be made for those with medical notes and authorities will help 
repatriate Austrians from Italy. Malta has suspended all flights into and out of Italy. Austria, Britain and Ireland have 
issued travel advisories for the whole country as Italy's extraordinary anti-coronavirus lockdown looked set to isolate 
the country inside and out. Maltese Prime Minister Robert Abela announced that until further notice, flights to and 
from Italy would be suspended and ships from Italy would only be allowed to dock if they were carrying cargo, food 
or medicine. Abela said the cruise ship MSC Grandiosa, which was to dock in Malta on Tuesday would not be 
allowed in since it just came from Palermo in Italy. Austria issued a full travel warning for Italy to "urgently 
recommend" that Austrian travelers return home. Britain and Ireland advised against all nonessential travel. 
Germany's national disease control institute, is describing all of Italy as a 'risk area.' ___ 7:30 p.m. Polish Prime 
Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says all mass events like concerts or sports events are being cancelled across the 
country in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  Although Poland has only recorded 18 cases, two of 
whom are in a serious condition, Morawiecki said the country is trying to be proactive in light of the increases 
recorded elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Italy.  Over 4,000 people are under quarantined at home after having 
been potentially exposed. The western Poznan region, which has one case, has also closed all schools, 
kindergartens, sports centers and the zoo.  In Austria, the Health Minister Rudolf Anschober says all indoor events 
with more than 100 people and all outdoor events with more than 500 people are being canceled until mid-April.

Mediterranean country has 41 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus — most of them linked to Iran.  Lebanon has 
been hit by a severe financial and economic crisis since October, particularly after mass protests against the 
country's ruling elite broke out in October. But street demonstrations have been minimal since the outbreak of the 
new coronavirus. — From Zeina Karam in Beirut. ___ 6 p.m. The government of China's Hubei province, the center 
of the virus outbreak, announced Tuesday the launch of an electronic "health code" system in which residents will 
be assigned colored QR codes through a mobile app that serves as a "voucher for personal travel." It will be 
implemented throughout the province. People with green codes, who are deemed healthy and not at risk, can travel 
freely within the province. Yellow codes are issued to people who have had close contact with infected patients, 
while red codes are for those who are confirmed or suspected cases or have a fever. The movement of people with 
red and yellow codes will be restricted. A similar system was first put into place in the eastern city of Hangzhou. ___ 
5:45 p.m. The weekly Tuesday market normally set up inside the Medieval walls of Soave, an Italian wine-
producing town near Verona, was canceled even before the government extended a virus containment order over 
the entire country.  The action was taken after the first case was confirmed in the town of 6,000 residents a day 
earlier, but word didn't get out and at least one vendor showed up to set up his stand before told being business 
would be closed.  Normally bustling on market day, the center of the town was nearly deserted Tuesday morning. 
The local newspaper vendor said people had mocked her for putting up shelves as a barrier next to the cash

register, saying incredulously, ''after just one case.''  Cafe owner Valentino Bonturi said he was enforcing new 
restrictions to ensure patrons weren't bunched too closely, meaning people needed to be seated rather than stand 
at a counter, as is customary. 'We follow the rules,' he said. Monica Chiamenti was buying bread in the center of 
town. ''We have to do it for our grandparents,'' she said of the new strict limits on movement. Her two sons have 
been keeping up with school at home but have been running into glitches on an app meant to stream video 
instruction. ___ 5:30 p.m. Lebanon has been hit by a severe financial and economic crisis since October,

least one patient who returned from Iran has left the hospital after two weeks of treatment. ___ 4:45 p.m. Dutch 
Prime Minister Mark Rutte called on citizens of the Netherlands to stop shaking hands to prevent spreading the new 
coronavirus and then -- oops! -- shook hands with the head of the infectious diseases department of the national 
public health institute. 'From this moment on, we stop shaking hands,' Rutte said at a news conference following a 
crisis meeting of government ministers Monday night to discuss the virus, which has killed three people and 
infected 321 in the country. 'You can do a foot kiss, bump elbows, whatever you want,' he said. 'I see all kinds of 
great variations on shaking hands emerging at schools, but from today we stop shaking hands.' As he wrapped up 
the news conference, he shook hands with Jaap van Dissel of the public health institute, who quickly pointed out 
the prime minister's error. 'Sorry, sorry, we can't do that anymore! Do it again!' Rutte said as he bumped elbows 
with van Dissel. ___ 4:30 p.m. The Czech Republic is banning all public events with more than 100 people and is

pleasant decision for the public,' he added. 'I hope they'll understand it.' The Czech Republic has 40 confirmed 
cases of COVID-19. ___ 4 p.m. The Italian government is assuring its citizens that supermarkets will remain open 
and stocked after panic buying erupted after broad anti-virus measures were announced nationwide, sparking 
overnight runs on 24-hour markets. Shoppers lined up overnight outside a Rome Carrefour to stock up after the 
government extended restrictions on movement from hard-hit northern Italy to the rest of the country. Some 
shoppers wore masks as they waited with their carts to be allowed into the store a few at a time. Premier Giuseppe 
Conte's office issued a clarifying statement after he signed the new decree late Monday, stressing that movement 
outside homes for 'normal necessities' such as grocery shopping will be allowed, as well as for work or health 
reasons. The statement said runs on supermarkets were contrary to the intent of the new decree which aims to 
prevent Italians from congregating. The government assured citizens that markets would be regularly supplied. ___ 
3:30 p.m. Pope Francis is urging priests to courageously go out to visit those sick from the coronavirus, even 
though Italy has imposed a nationwide lockdown to limit movement and prevent the virus' spread. The Vatican on 
Tuesday livestreamed Francis' morning Mass, which he celebrated alone in the chapel of the Vatican hotel where 
he lives. The celebration came hours after the Italian government extended restrictions on movement from virus-hit 
northern Italy to the rest of the country in a bid to slow the epidemic. Exceptions include for work or health reasons, 
or for 'necessities,' such as grocery shopping. In his homily, Francis prayed for the sick and the doctors and nurses 
who are caring for them. He said: 'Let us pray to the Lord also for our priests, that they may have the courage to go 
out and go to the sick people bringing the strength of God's word and the Eucharist and accompany the health 
workers and volunteers in this work that they are doing." The Vatican, a walled city-state in the heart of Rome, is 
respecting the Italian lockdown and has imposed restrictions on movement and contact among personnel. One 
person inside Vatican City has tested positive and five people who came into contact with that person are under 
precautionary quarantine. ___ 3 p.m. Authorities in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north of ethnically split Cyprus on 
Tuesday reported the first virus case in the region, a 65-year-old German tourist who arrived on Sunday and 
developed a high fever.  The hotel where she and the group of 30 tourists she traveled with has been quarantined.  
The Cypriot government on Monday announced the country's first two cases. They include the head of the 
cardiology unit at the country's largest state hospital in the capital, Nicosia. The unit has been placed under 
quarantine while staff are being tested. All hospital visits and admissions have been suspended for 48 hours. ___ 2 
p.m. Mongolia says its first coronavirus case is a French energy worker who didn't follow instructions to isolate

himself.  Authorities say the 56-year-old man works for an exploration company affiliated with the French energy 
company Areva.  He arrived on March 2 from Moscow and was instructed to isolate himself in himself in his hotel. 
Instead, authorities say, he visited several restaurants and met with colleagues at his company's office before 
traveling by train to the East Gobi region where he worked.  All incoming and outgoing traffic to the capital 
Ulaanbaatar was closed from Tuesday to March 17. Authorities are working to identify more than 500 people who 
may have contact with the patient.  Mongolia closed its border with China weeks ago because of the virus outbreak 
there, and flights to Beijing and Seoul have been canceled. The northern border with Russia remains open and 
flights to Moscow and Berlin are continuing. ___ 1:30 p.m. The European Central Bank says a staff member has the 
new coronavirus. The ECB said in a statement late Monday that about 100 colleagues who worked near the 
infected staff member have been told to work from home as a precaution.  The Frankfurt-based central bank says it 
is also 'undertaking a deep clean of potentially affected office spaces.' ___ A cruise ship barred from Thailand and 
Malaysia due to coronavirus fears has returned to Singapore a week after it set sail from the city-state. Passengers 
wheeling luggage off the Costa Fortuna were ushered to waiting coaches and ferried away Tuesday morning. Most 
were not wearing masks. Some passengers told reporters at the scene everything was great and that everyone 
aboard the ship was fine. No cases of infection with the new virus has been confirmed in the ship. Singapore 
authorities previously said doctors would check people before they disembarked.  The ship was refused docking in 
Thailand because it carried 64 Italians and that country has been the epicenter of Europe's outbreak. Malaysia also 
turned away the ship. Singapore allowed the ship to dock because it had been scheduled and all passengers on 
board had been screened before the ship sailed.  The virus is a concern on cruise ships after hundreds became 
infected on a ship that was under quarantine at a Japanese port last month. A ship that docked in California on 
Monday let off its passengers to face quarantines at U.S. facilities or in their home countries. Twenty-one people on 
that ship are infected. ___ South Korea's professional baseball league has postponed its season to sometime 
during mid-April due to the coronavirus. The Korea Baseball Organization said Tuesday it still hopes to maintain a 
144-game regular-season schedule but will consider banning spectators from some games when risks of infections 
are high. South Korea's professional basketball league has halted its regular season since Feb. 29, while the 
soccer league has postponed the start of its new season. The Japanese baseball league season was postponed 
earlier after playing preseason games without spectators. The season was to open on March 20. It might start some 
time in April. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes

The Cypriot government on Monday announced the country's first two cases. They include the head of the 
cardiology unit at the country's largest state hospital in the capital, Nicosia. The unit has been placed under 
quarantine while staff are being tested. All hospital visits and admissions have been suspended for 48 hours. ___ 2 
p.m. Mongolia says its first coronavirus case is a French energy worker who didn't follow instructions to isolate 
himself.  Authorities say the 56-year-old man works for an exploration company affiliated with the French energy 
company Areva.  He arrived on March 2 from Moscow and was instructed to isolate himself in himself in his hotel. 
Instead, authorities say, he visited several restaurants and met with colleagues at his company's office before 
traveling by train to the East Gobi region where he worked.  All incoming and outgoing traffic to the capital 
Ulaanbaatar was closed from Tuesday to March 17. Authorities are working to identify more than 500 people who 
may have contact with the patient.  Mongolia closed its border with China weeks ago because of the virus outbreak 
there, and flights to Beijing and Seoul have been canceled. The northern border with Russia remains open and 
flights to Moscow and Berlin are continuing. ___ 1:30 p.m. The European Central Bank says a staff member has the 
new coronavirus. The ECB said in a statement late Monday that about 100 colleagues who worked near the 
infected staff member have been told to work from home as a precaution.  The Frankfurt-based central bank says it 
is also 'undertaking a deep clean of potentially affected office spaces.' ___ A cruise ship barred from Thailand and 
Malaysia due to coronavirus fears has returned to Singapore a week after it set sail from the city-state. Passengers 
wheeling luggage off the Costa Fortuna were ushered to waiting coaches and ferried away Tuesday morning. Most 
were not wearing masks. Some passengers told reporters at the scene everything was great and that everyone 
aboard the ship was fine. No cases of infection with the new virus has been confirmed in the ship. Singapore 
authorities previously said doctors would check people before they disembarked.  The ship was refused docking in 
Thailand because it carried 64 Italians and that country has been the epicenter of Europe's outbreak. Malaysia also 
turned away the ship. Singapore allowed the ship to dock because it had been scheduled and all passengers on 
board had been screened before the ship sailed.  The virus is a concern on cruise ships after hundreds became 
infected on a ship that was under quarantine at a Japanese port last month. A ship that docked in California on 
Monday let off its passengers to face quarantines at U.S. facilities or in their home countries. Twenty-one people on 
that ship are infected. ___ South Korea's professional baseball league has postponed its season to sometime 
during mid-April due to the coronavirus. The Korea Baseball Organization said Tuesday it still hopes to maintain a 
144-game regular-season schedule but will consider banning spectators from some games when risks of infections 
are high. South Korea's professional basketball league has halted its regular season since Feb. 29, while the 
soccer league has postponed the start of its new season. The Japanese baseball league season was postponed 
earlier after playing preseason games without spectators. The season was to open on March 20. It might start some 
time in April. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes

Mar 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) increased its revenue decline projection for the airline industry in 
2020. The forecast for the higher amount of revenue losses was due to multiple flight cancellations following the 
rapid spread of the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) to multiple countries across the globe.Additionally, passenger 
traffic growth across the globe in January 2020 was the slowest in a decade due to the above-mentioned health 
peril. Moreover, with Italy being one of the worst-affected coronavirus countries, European carrier Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1], which had earlier decided to trim its capacity to/from Italy by 25% from Mar 17 to Apr 8, announced that 
it intends to suspend more domestic and international Italian flights through Apr 8.Coronavirus-related updates were 
also available from U.S. carriers like JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] and Southwest Airlines LUV[3] in the past week. 
While JetBlue withdrew its first-quarter 2020 and full-year outlooks, Southwest Airlines lowered its first-quarter unit 
revenue view due to this health hazard.(Read the lastAirline Stock Rounduphere[4])Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1. According to Alexandre de Juniac, director general and CEO of the IATA, passenger traffic 
growth across the globe in January 2020 was the slowest in a decade. 
Notably, demand (measured in total revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) inched up 2.4% in the month on a 
year-over-year basis, signaling the lowest monthly increase since Apr 2010.Juniac termed the January traffic 
performance of airlines as the 'tip of the iceberg' as 'major travel restrictions in China did not begin until Jan 23'. In 
the opening month of the ongoing year, the health scare was only confined to China and was still considered an 
epidemic. (Read more:Coronavirus Upends Air Travel as Growth Slumps to Decade Low[5]).2. Given the vast 
majority of countries that the coronavirus outbreak has spread to and the resultant slump in forward bookings, the 
IATA now anticipates a global passenger revenue loss of $63-$113 billion for 2020. This is significantly higher than 
the previous projection of a $29.3-billion passenger revenue loss when its estimate was based on the assumption 
that the coronavirus-caused low demand would affect mostly the Chinese market. The research firm anticipates a 
negative $63-billion passenger revenue impact assuming that the outbreak will mostly impact demand in the Asia-
Pacific (China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea), Europe (France, Italy, Germany) and the Middle East (Iran). (Read 
more: IATA's New Forecast Adds Gloom to Coronavirus-Hit Airlines[6]).3. Management at Southwest Airlines now 
expects first-quarter total revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to either dip 2% 
or increase up to 1% from the year-ago figure. The company had earlier anticipated a RASM increase in the 3.5-
Airline Stock Roundup: IATA 's Downbeat Coronavirus -Led Forecast, LUV in Focus
5.5% range for the March quarter.Notably, this Dallas, TX- based Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) airline witnessed upbeat 
passenger bookings in January and February (the first two months of the quarter). However, recently, demand 
declined massively coupled with an increase in trip cancellations. The carrier expects the drop in demand to persist 
in the remainder of March, given the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, first-quarter operating 
revenues are expected to decline between $200 and $300 million. (Read more: Southwest Airlines Down on 
Coronavirus-Induced Q1 RASM View[7]).You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) 
stocks here[8].4. As JetBlue is experiencing 'significant deterioration' in forward bookings since late February due to 
the rapid spread of the coronavirus, the low-cost carrier withdrew its guidance for first-quarter 2020 as well as the 
full year. The carrier expects coronavirus to negatively impact its first-quarter RASM performance significantly. To 
combat this virus-induced low demand, JetBlue is taking steps to control costs. On similar lines, United Airlines 
UAL[9] plans to trim domestic capacity by 10%. The Chicago, IL-based airline intends to cut back U.S. and 
Canadian flights by 10% as well as slash capacity on international schedule by 20% in April. Simultaneously, United 
Airlines is putting hiring (except for crucial positions) on pause at least through Jun 30. (Read more: United Airlines 
Takes Several Steps to Fight Coronavirus Woes[10]).5.Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[11] intends to invest $50 
million in establishing a new base at Concord, NC. The company aims to immediately start hiring pilots, flight 
attendants, mechanics and ground personnel to facilitate operations at the new base, which are expected to begin 
Oct 7, 2020. Notably, the commencement of operations is likely to generate at least 66 high-wage jobs. Moreover, 
two Airbus aircraft will be housed at the new base.(Read more: Allegiant to Set Up $50M Worth North Carolina 
Operational Base[12]).Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red 
over the past week inducing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to decline 11.4% to $73.91 as the coronavirus woes 
rock the industry. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker has declined 25.3%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space?Investors will await the fourth-quarter 2019 earnings report of Azul AZUL[13], scheduled to be released on 
Mar 12. Watch this space for further updates on the coronavirus and its resultant impact on the sector.Just

Mar 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Hawaiian Holdings, 
Inc.'s HA[1] wholly-owned subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines — withdrew expectations for operating revenue per 
available seat mile (RASM) for the first quarter due to ambiguity surrounding the impact of coronavirus on air travel 
demand. As of Mar 5, if there are no new net bookings for March, the airline anticipates a 12% decline in the metric 
in the first quarter. Previously, RASM was expected to decline 4.5-7.5% in the period.Meanwhile, capacity is still 
estimated to increase 7.5-10.5% in the quarter. Additionally, adjusted cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, is 
projected to decline 1.5-4.5% in the current quarter, unchanged from previous expectation. With fuel prices having 
declined significantly since the beginning of the year, the carrier now predicts economic fuel cost per gallon to be 
$1.87 compared with the previous forecast of $1.97.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price

Ryanair and Aer Lingus owner well positioned in airline industry shakeout
Ryanair and Aer Lingus owner well positioned in airline industry shakeout

The coronavirus will accelerate a Darwinian shakeout in Europe's overcrowded airline industry that ultimately 
benefits Ryanair and British Airways owner IAG, industry experts predict.
Nobody is exempt from the short-term pain that has already seen Flybe collapse and Norwegian Air stock lose 
about 70% of its value in a month, with no end to the crisis in sight.
But the extreme stress-test already promises to increase the power of a handful of key players, when the epidemic 
eventually recedes and passengers return en masse.
"It's inevitable in the next couple of weeks we'll see more failures," Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in 
a recent interview, citing Flybe and Norwegian as vulnerable.
Within days, the British regional carrier had ceased operations, blaming the virus outbreak for a sudden cash drain, 
and Norwegian scrapped 2020 guidance.
Norwegian did not respond to O'Leary's comments. However, the company - which raised cash from shareholders 
in November for the third time in less than two years - has been cutting costs and unprofitable routes, as well as 
selling assets, to bolster its finances.
Whereas four airlines now control 80% of the U.S. market, Europe remains fragmented, with governments, unions 
and bilateral agreements impeding tie-ups. Consolidation happens when airlines grab routes and traffic from 
bankrupt rivals.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus owner well positioned in airline industry shakeout
Flybe's demise reduces price competition on routes it shared with Ryanair and easyJet, just as a Norwegian exit 
would support competitors' fares and traffic.
"This virus will expedite the thesis of consolidation, possibly to extreme levels," Citi analyst Mark Manduca said, 
adding that 35% of Europe's short-haul market was loss-making in 2019.
For investors who still want airlines, Manduca added, "we recommend sticking with the well-capitalized names who 
in 2021 should be able to consolidate the market: Ryanair and IAG."
The virus's spread is hitting more routes - prompting a 50% cut in capacity by Lufthansa - while the full traffic impact 
is yet to show up in published data.
International bookings to Europe plunged 79% as the outbreak mushroomed in Italy, leaving no doubt that the 
slump will be worse than the 2003 SARS epidemic. It may wipe $113 billion off airlines' revenues, according to 
IATA, their global association.
Airline executives still cling to the hope of a "V-shaped" rebound, mirroring SARS. Those with robust balance 
sheets can plan for the time when demand comes roaring back.
A three-month shutdown would inflate Air France-KLM's net debt to 7.7 times earnings, Citi calculates, and swell 
Lufthansa's multiple to 12.4.
But Ryanair's leverage would remain at a relatively manageable 1.2, easyJet's at 1.9 and IAG's at 3.5.
Ryanair's growth has been hampered by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft - it has 135 on order - and 
sold-out production of the Airbus A321neo it is eyeing for Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion.
But CEO O'Leary believes the crisis may bring aircraft deals as stressed customers relinquish delivery slots, and 
stands ready to place orders "today, tomorrow, next week" if the price is right, he said at a March 3 event in 
Brussels.
The MAX grounding, after two deadly crashes, has cushioned Ryanair against a downturn by leaving fewer seats to 
fill, O'Leary acknowledged. But, with an eye on the long term, "I would prefer not to be cushioned," he added.
Mid-sized carriers such as Portugal's TAP, Alitalia and SAS are "not in a great leverage situation" and could 
succumb, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said. Italy has promised another 400 million euros to Alitalia even as the 
European Union investigates its last 900-million-euro loan.
Sweden's SAS is taking "strong measures to mitigate costs in the face of the new market situation," a 
spokeswoman said, citing reduced timetables, temporary layoffs and a hiring freeze among them. Alitalia and TAP 
did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Among airlines whose failure could drive consolidation, "the most meaningful would be Norwegian," Roeska said, 
citing its large network and overlap with rivals.
"It's not guaranteed they have to go bust," he said, with much depending on planned asset sales. "It's still unclear to 
us how long they have cash for."
Even if the crisis threatens larger airlines, few would expect an Air France-KLM or a Lufthansa to be allowed to fail 
by their governments. But large carriers are warning against state support for smaller rivals.
"There were airlines who were looking for state aid before this happened," said outgoing IAG boss Willie Walsh, 
who cleared European regulatory hurdles to merge BA with Iberia in 2011 before adding Vueling, Aer Lingus and 
Air Europa.
"I don't believe this is an excuse for those weaker airlines to demand state aid," Walsh said.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus owner well positioned in airline industry shakeout
The slump may rattle Air France-KLM as new CEO Ben Smith pursues a costly fleet renewal to cut operating 
expenses and improve the group's trailing profitability.
Business bookings have been hit, Smith told Reuters, but Asia may be bottoming out and some China services 
could soon resume. "We're looking every week at when we'll start returning," he said.
Privately, however, other executives at the Franco-Dutch group expressed concern.
Its weaker margins make Air France-KLM more fragile than major peers, said one. "I don't see any silver linings."

POINTSSome airlines are still allowing flights to the U.K. from northern Italy and some Britons are unhappy about 
itItaly's norther region is the hardest-hit in all of Europe with COVID-19 deaths reaching 366 as of Sunday 
eveningItaly announced draconian measures in efforts to contain the virus and prevent further spreading British 
Airways, EasyJet, and Ryanair still offer return flights to Milan, Italy, one of the cities on lockdown amid coronavirus 
fears. Some Britons have expressed disappointment over ongoing operations despite the lockdown 
announcement.According to the Daily Mail[1], passengers can still make bookings online as offered by the said 
airlines, prompting questions about why the airlines are still operating flights to a location included in Italy's hardest-
hit areas.Aside from continuous flights to Italy, it was reported that British nationals returning from some of Italy's 
COVID-19-infected areas in Lombardy are not being screened for potential coronavirus infection.On Sunday, the 
U.K. Foreign Office confirmed that Britons who will choose to fly back home from northern Italy will not be required 
to take coronavirus tests. 
Instead, they are advised to quarantine themselves at home.EasyJet has since announced that it will cancel several 
flights to and from the Lombardy region in Italy until April 3. The said date is the initial lockdown expiry for the region 
that has around 16 million residents.Meanwhile, Italian interior minister Luciana Lamorgese said on Monday that 
anyone who attempts to leave locked-down regions in the country referred to as 'containment regions' may face up 
to three months behind bars, CNN[2] reported. Aside from the strict travel restrictions for people in the country, 
there will also be checkpoints placed across the northern region as part of the plans to implement health checks for 
people riding and driving.Cruise ship passengers who will arrive in Venice will not be allowed to disembark. Instead, 
they will be returned to their country or origin or will be returned to their residences if they are from Italy.The 
draconian measures came after a shocking spike in new cases in Italy on Saturday. There were 1,247 confirmed 
coronavirus cases and deaths have reached 366.BBC[3] reported that after the new travel measures were 
announced, there have been several riots across northern Italy. Even in prisons, riots kicked off as people 
expressed refusal to abide by the new restrictions.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday that the 
government will work on stimulating the economy as it is expected that various segments will be impacted by the 
lockdown. Schools, gyms, and various other facilities have already been shuttered amid COVID-19 fears.Italy's 
coronavirus infection toll has reached 7,375 as of Monday morning. [ 1]: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-

Mar 09, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Travelling in and 
out of Italy's coronavirus-hit north continued by rail, road and air on Monday despite a government crackdown that 
was meant to isolate the region.Airlines including EasyJet, Ryanair, British Airways were still serving airports in 
Milan and Venice -- the region's two biggest transport hubs -- even as all three companies announced fresh cuts to 
their flight schedules serving northern Italy.The government on Sunday imposed sweeping measures to restrict 
travel in the prosperous north, the centre of Italy's virus outbreak. Rail passengers told AFP their identity documents 
were being checked on arrival to make sure they were residents of Milan Photo: AFP / Miguel MEDINA Travel is 
allowed only for compelling reasons such as work or medical need -- and for those who had been in the region 
temporarily to return home.Officials promised to set up checkpoints to enforce the measures, which are backed by 
fines of more than 200 euros ($230). Despite the full schedule, one cafe worker at Malpensa complained the effect 
on the airport has been worse than the September 11 attack Photo: AFP / MIGUEL MEDINA On a main road 
leading out of the city of Modena -- inside the exclusion zone -- AFP saw controls come into effect on Monday 
afternoon, with at least one car being turned back. 
But there was some concern about whether the checks are rigorous enough."I find it a bit pointless to establish a 
red zone if you can get in and out freely," said 21-year-old courier Jonuzi Agron."If I go to Bologna from Modena 
and no one controls me I can infect anyone." International flights leaving Italy Photo: AFP / Patricio ARANA Rail 
operator Trenitalia has made changes to its schedules but is still running services in and out of the region.At Milan's 
central station, passengers had to queue up at special checkpoints staffed by soldiers and police."I'm about to leave

on Monday it was reducing services in part because many passengers were not turning up for flights they had 
booked.But the airline said it wanted to maintain some services to Italy "to bring home" foreigners in Lombardy and 
other virus-hit regions.Linate airport's website was showing a spate of cancellations, while at Malpensa where 
flights were still scheduled to take off, one cafe worker said the effect on the airport has been worse than the 
September 11 attacks in the United States.Rail passengers told AFP their identity documents were being checked

also being introduced for cruise ships at Venice port.Passengers "will not be able to disembark to visit the city but 
can transit only in order to return to their place of residence or countries of origin", Italy's interior ministry said in a 
statement Sunday.But the more stringent quarantine measures imposed last month around 11 areas considered to 
be the centres of the outbreak have now been partially lifted, according to officials in Codogno, a town outside 
Milan.Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who identified 
the Italian strain last month, told AFP that the lifting of those measures "makes no sense"."These measures need to 
be in place for longer in order for the sacrifice they have made (being under lockdown) to be effective," he said.

FLYBE'S FINAL FLIGHT; After the collapse of Europe's biggest regional airline, Alex Daniellooks into what 
went wrong

AT 8.30pm on Wednesday evening, passengers were still being ushered onto planes bearing the indigo livery of 
Flybe. Half an hour later, members of the cabin crew on one of its last ever flights, from Manchester to Belfast, were 
crying, having just lost their jobs.
"Staff in tears. This is so grim," tweeted Holly Hamilton, a BBC presenter aboard the flight, from the runway. "Plane 
is just really quiet."
Such is the nature of airlines going bust. Normality is ripped out from under the feet of employees and passengers 
alike. People are left stranded in foreign places hoping the government will step in to get them home. Cabin crew 
and pilots learn that they no longer have a job while taxiing on the runway. It is abrupt.
In the case of Flybe, which operates about 40 per cent of British domestic flights, it was the coronavirus and the 
subsequent lack of demand for air travel in recent weeks that finally forced it under. Chief executive Mark Anderson 
said in his parting message to staff that the virus had "put additional pressure on an already difficult situation," 
making his firm the UK's first major corporate casualty of the outbreak.
The truth is, however, that this was a long time coming. Flybe nearly went out of business last year, before being 
bought out by a consortium including Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic. Then, in January, the government was 
forced to promise another bailout, in the form of a tax delay and a £100m loan as the airline teetered on the brink 
again. Eventually, however, the deal fell through.
FLYBE'S FINAL FLIGHT; After the collapse of Europe's biggest regional airline, Alex Daniellooks into what 
went wrong
"Coronavirus will likely become the scapegoat for Flybe's collapse, but it would be obtuse and even dangerous to 
blame it wholly for the situation," Alana Gomez, a spokesperson for flight-comparison site Jetcost, tells me. "The 
airline has been struggling for some time now, and would likely have still gone under without the assistance of the 
virus."
One factor which the carrier had long blamed for its ropey finances was air passenger duty (APD), a tax on all 
passenger flights from UK airports, except for the Scottish highlands. Flybe maintained that it disproportionately 
handicapped its customer base because they had to pay the tax each time they set off from home tarmac. 
Meanwhile, most passengers at other airlines only take off in the UK, with their return journey departing from a 
foreign country, meaning they only pay one-way. As a result, one option the government had considered was to cut 
the tax for Flybe.
However, this incensed two of the most influential airline chief executives in Europe: Willie Walsh and Michael 
O'Leary. The two boisterous Irishmen, bosses of British Airways owner IAG and Ryanair respectively, railed against 
what they saw as unfair state aid in favour of their competitor. O'Leary wrote to then-chancellor, Sajid Javid: "If the 
first critical business decision of your new government is to bail out a loss-making turkey like Flybe, for the sole 
benefit of billionaires like Richard Branson ... then your business strategy is doomed to fail."
As a result, the government looked increasingly likely to ease APD rules for all airlines at next week's budget - 
especially given current projections that the coronavirus outbreak will hit global airlines to the tune of $113bn.
"It would make a lot of sense to waive APD for the next nine months to the end of the year to stimulate travel to 
come back and put more money in the traveller's pocket to buy an air fare," says John Grant, analyst at aviation 
data specialist OAG, in the wake of the Flybe collapse.
It is perhaps ironic, then, that the virus outbreak which eventually stopped Flybe from flying could have precipitated 
a round of much-needed state aid across the industry. If only it had held on a little longer. Grant tells me: "If it had 
been three weeks down the road and Flybe had managed to find a way to survive those extra three weeks, they 
might actually have got some breaks that could have helped them in the longer term."
In one sense, the failure unravels what could have become something of a Gordian knot for Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson. The airline's financial frailties had placed him at an ideological impasse. On one hand, he has repeatedly 
promised to "level up" the rest of the UK outside London, which made it politically unpalatable to let Flybe - the 
jewel in the crown for British regional connectivity - go bust. On the other, the Conservatives are the party of the 
free www.market.No Tory PM wants to intervene to save a failing company within weeks of being elected.
Besides, promising to bail out an airline which operates five flights between Southampton and Manchester every 
day hardly screams of a government pulling out all the stops to fight global warming. As Caroline Lucas, Green MP 
for Brighton, said in January: "Addressing Flybe's problems by reducing air passenger duty on all domestic flights is 
utterly inconsistent with any serious commitment to tackle the climate crisis."
But in the long run, the fact remains that three major British airlines have met this fate in four years, after Monarch 
in 2017 and Thomas Cook last September. Across those cases, hundreds of thousands of Brits were brought home 
by the government, in repatriations the size of which had not been seen in the postwar era.
Flybe's case is not on the same scale - in part because most people whose flights were cancelled were already on 
home turf - but it raises further questions over a long-delayed reform.
Since 2018, successive transport ministers have promised to shake up the rules which govern how airline collapses 
are handled, a change which could keep planes flying long enough to get people home, even after the carrier's 
funds have run dry.
FLYBE'S FINAL FLIGHT; After the collapse of Europe's biggest regional airline, Alex Daniellooks into what 
went wrong
A Department for Transport spokesperson points out that these reforms were included in the Queen's Speech on 
19 December. This did not come in time for Thomas Cook's failure, however, nor for Flybe's, a delay which Oliver 
Richardson, national officer of trade union Unite, calls "simply outrageous".
Insolvency rules aside, one thing has become clear: coronavirus or not, the government misjudged Flybe's 
predicament when it promised to save the company in January.
"The airline's network was fundamentally flawed," says Grant. "It ran extremely disparate, low-frequency services 
on many routes, and had a lack of focus and strategy about what its business model was. It was behaving like a 
low-cost airline, but without the low costs."
His analysis runs in direct contradiction to what then-business secretary Andrea Leadsom said about the company 
in January. Asked why the government decided to help Flybe, she said it was because the airline was "a viable 
business".
When I put this to Grant, he retorts: "What would politicians know about airlines?"
Flybe was behaving like a low-cost airline, but without the low costs

Mar 09, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Travelling into and out of Italy's 
coronavirus-hit north was continuing by rail, road and air on Monday -- despite a government crackdown that was 
meant to isolate the region.Airlines including EasyJet, Ryanair, British Airways and Air France were continuing to 
serve airports in Milan and Venice -- the region's two biggest transport hubs.The government imposed sweeping 
measures to restrict travel in the prosperous north on Sunday, where the outbreak has been at its worst.Travel is 
allowed only for compelling reasons such as work or medical need -- and for those who had been in the region 
temporarily to return home.Officials promised to set up checkpoints on roads and the measures are backed by fines 
of more than 200 euros ($230) for transgressors.On a main road leading out of the city of Modena -- inside the 
exclusion zone -- AFP saw controls come into effect on Monday afternoon, with one car being turned back.As for 
rail travel, operator Trenitalia has made changes to its schedules but is still running services in and out of the 
region.At Milan's central train station on Monday passengers had to queue up at special checkpoints staffed by 
soldiers and police."I'm about to leave this city because I'm afraid to be here," said 20-year-old student Adriana 
from Belarus as she made her way to her train. 
Airlines had already been cutting routes in recent weeks and national carrier Alitalia said it would stop flying from 
Milan's Malpensa airport.An AFP photographer at the airport said the terminal was virtually deserted on Monday 
morning.However domestic flights from the city's Linate airport would continue, Alitalia said.The websites of both 
airports were showing a swathe of cancellations, with most flights scrapped at Linate, but most services still 
scheduled to take off at Malpensa.Despite the full schedule, one cafe worker at Malpensa complained the effect on 
the airport has been worse than the September 11 terrorist attack.- 'Afraid to be here' -Rail passengers told AFP 
their identity documents were being checked on arrival to make sure they were residents of Milan.Travellers 
venturing in or out of the new zone are meant to present "self-certifications" of their reasons for travel, which 
officials say can then be checked at further checkpoints.There will also be temperature checks for passengers at 
train station entrances and exits.Checks are also being introduced for cruise ships at Venice port.Passengers "will 
not be able to disembark to visit the city but can transit only in order to return to their place of residence or countries 
of origin".But the more stringent quarantine measures which were imposed last month around 11 areas considered 
to be the centres of the outbreak have now been partially lifted, according to officials in Codogno, one of the towns 
affected.Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who 
identified the Italian strain last month, told AFP that the lifting of those measures "makes no sense"."These 
measures need to be in place for longer in order for the sacrifice they have made (being under lockdown) to be 
effective," he said.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/uk-set-to-leave-eu-aviation-safety-regulator-at-end-of-2020/The UK will leave 
the European aviation safety regulator after the Brexit transition period, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has 
confirmed.He said UK membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency - responsible for certifying the 
airworthiness of planes - would end on 31 December. He said the UK's Civil Aviation Authority would 'bring 
expertise home'. But the owner of British Airways said the CAA lacked world-class knowledge and could not be 
ready in time. 
Mr Shapps told Aviation Week[1] much of the Cologne-based European Aviation Safety Agency's (EASA) expertise 
came from the UK and that a lot of its leaders were British. He said the agency's powers would revert to the Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) 'and the expertise will need to come home to do that, but we'll do it in a gradual way'.'Best 
option'The trade body ADS - which represents more than 1,100 UK businesses in the aerospace, defence, security 
and space sectors - told the BBC the decision could potentially mean products and designs would need to be 
certified more than once. For example, EASA is responsible for certifying commercial aircraft for service across the 
EU and some non-EU European countries. When the UK ends its membership of EASA, it may need to certify 
aircraft separately itself. ADS has estimated that it would take 10 years and cost up to 40m annually to create a UK 
safety authority with all the expertise of EASA, against a current contribution to the European agency of 1m to 4m a 
year. It claimed a new regulatory regime could put jobs in the sector at risk. 'We have been clear that continued 
participation in EASA is the best option to maintain the competitiveness of our 36bn aerospace industry and our 
access to global export markets,' the trade body said. It added that the UK's influence within EASA 'contributes to 
raising standards in global aviation' and helped make the industry 'attractive to the investment it needs'. British 
Airways owner IAG said it was 'disappointed' with the decision and said the Civil Aviation Authority 'does not have 
the expertise required to operate as a world class safety and technical regulator'. IAG said: 'The CAA will require 
fundamental restructuring from top to bottom which will take time. There is no way that it can be done by 31 
December.' Airlines UK, which represents carriers including EasyJet and Ryanair, said its members supported 
continued membership of EASA - but not at the risk of the UK becoming a 'dumb follower of EU rules'. It urged the 
government to begin negotiations on an air safety agreement with the EU so it could be ready by the end of the 
year. The Department for Transport said: 'Being a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency is not 
compatible with the UK having genuine economic and political independence. 'We will maintain world-leading safety

standards for industry, with the Civil Aviation Authority taking over these responsibilities, and will continue to work 
with colleagues in the EU to establish a new regulatory relationship.' Read more: UK set to leave EU aviation safety

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/future-of-many-flybe-routes-at-risk-after-collapse/Dozens of routes serving the 
UK's regions could be left without services after the collapse of Flybe.Scotland's Loganair has committed to 
maintaining 16 routes, but many smaller airports still face gaping holes in their schedules. The carrier, Europe's 
largest regional operator, went into administration early on Thursday, after a bid for fresh financial support failed. 
Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was 'very sorry' for the firm's collapse. He told staff one of the firm's 
shareholders had pulled out at the start of this week, and he had spoken 'frantically to the government' asking for 
rescue aid, but that they had run out of time on Wednesday night.What is happening to Flybe's flights?All of Flybe's 
flights have been cancelled and customers with bookings should not travel to the airport unless they have arranged 
an alternative flight. Flybe operated 210 flights, serving the UK's regional airports and dominating routes out of 
Southampton, Exeter and Belfast. But it also linked regional airports with more than a dozen other European 
destinations. In response to the collapse, the UK government said it would work with other airlines to replace 
services. Aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst said the government also 'stands ready' to support regional airports 
affected by the collapse. She said: 'We recognise the impact that this will have on UK airports particularly those 
which have large-scale Flybe operations.'Will the regions lose those services?Although Flybe is small compared to 
the likes of British Airways, Ryanair or EasyJet, the loss of the operator has been described as 'disastrous' for UK 
regions[1]. Air transport expert John Strickland said Flybe is 'small in the scale of the UK market as a whole, but if 
you're flying out of Exeter, Newquay or specifically Southampton it really is one of the only airline choices so a 
number of regional groups will risk not being served'. However rival airlines are interested in operating at least 
some of the routes. Loganair has opened a special recruitment line for former Flybe employees as it works on plans 
to salvage services on 16 of Flybe's 120 routes[2]. They include flights from existing bases for Loganair, including 
Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Newcastle. Belfast City airport said it was in talks with multiple 
airlines to fill the routes left empty; 77% of its routes were operated by Flybe. Brian Ambrose, chief executive of 
Belfast City Airport, said he was 'pleased' that Loganair will backfill routes between Belfast and Aberdeen and 
Inverness, less than 24 hours after Flybe entered administration. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said that 
he 'very much hoped' that other airlines would take up vacant routes. He said discussions with other airlines would 
'begin in earnest' soon and he hoped to reinstate services 'on those routes hopefully within weeks rather than 
months'.

? Under-pressure airlines drag European stocks down ? Yields on US and UK government bonds hit record lows ? 
Brent crude slides as Opec discusses plans for output cuts US and European stocks failed to cling on to recent 
gains yesterday, despite governments rolling out further largescale measures aimed at tackling the coronavirus 
outbreak.
The US House of Representatives and IMF on Wednesday approved $8bn and $50bn packages, respectively, 
intended to combat the spread of the contagion.
But the steady stream of discouraging news from companies spelling out virusrelated disruption left investors 
struggling "to find the correct balance between the need to de-risk on the back of virus-related fundamental 
concerns versus the growing appeal of risky assets", said analysts at Rabobank.
The region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 1.4 per cent with airlines among the weakest performers.
The collapse of the UK's Flybe turned attention to other carriers. Europe's travel and leisure sector fell 2.8 per cent 
with Ryanair down more than 5 per cent and Air France-KLM tumbling 11 per cent.
Finnair, Finland's flag carrier, yesterday announced that it had cancelled 1,100 flights while America's Southwest 
Airlines, the world's biggest low-cost carrier, revealed it expected a $200m-$300m hit to first-quarter core sales.
The global MSCI ACWI Airlines index is down more than 20 per cent this year, underperforming the 5 per cent slide 
in the MSCI's broader benchmark.

AS MINISTERIAL tweets go, the mid-January proclamation by the business and transport secretaries that Flybe's 
future had been salvaged will surely endure as among the most ill-judged of Boris Johnson's government.
Barely 54 days later, Flybe has become just another corporate carcass, joining Monarch and Thomas Cook among 
the airlines which failed to cope with brutal industry conditions.
So much for the denials of Mark Anderson, the boss of Flybe parent Connect Airways, that his company was 
seeking a state bailout.
With the advent of coronavirus, the £3.5m in tax deferrals it secured from HM Revenue & Customs barely touched 
the sides. His witness statement, filed in court on Tuesday night after last-ditch rescue talks had failed, details a 
company that was in perpetual survival mode even after its deeppocketed shareholders took it over. It would be 
ludicrous to blame the government or the airline's management for the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on future 
bookings.
Serious questions do need to be asked, though, about the apparent lack of effort on Flybe's part to secure 
emergency financing from private lenders before the infection emerged, and the apparent lack of co-ordination 
between Whitehall departments - particularly since last month's cabinet reshuff le.
Anderson's court filing implies that the government was willing to provide financial support but took fright at the legal 
threats of Ryanair and of British Airways' parent International Airlines Group. That's not a good look, when 
thousands of jobs are at stake.
Flybe infected by aviation sector's malaise
For Flybe staff, it will be a painful coincidence that its collapse came in the same week that British Steel - which has 
enjoyed nearly a year of financial support from taxpayers - took a big stride towards long-term survival. However 
much Johnson might seek to deny it, winners are being picked by his administration.
The decision to reject Flybe's loan application may well have made sense on commercial grounds, but for a 
government which has promised to "level up" the UK's regions, its collapse leaves them staring at a gaping policy 
inconsistency - and one perfect for pointing out on a medium like Twitter.
WATCHDOG'S GOLDMAN AUDIT Here's an unexpected, and interesting, intervention in the frenzied debate about 
auditor independence.
It comes from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which has decided - in the wake of balance sheet 
bombshells at Metro Bank and Citi - to take big lenders to task over the quality of their regulatory reporting.
Last week, it emerged the PRA had appointed PwC to oversee a "skilled person's report" on the filing of data to 
regulators by Goldman Sachs International. The decision has not gone unnoticed by PwC's peers, who point out 
that the accountancy firm is Goldman's global auditor.
Sources say the PRA has satisfied itself that because Goldman's Londonbased operations are now audited by 
Mazars, there is no conflict in PwC conducting the Section 166 review.
Indeed, under the Financial Reporting Council's recently revised ethical standard, S166 investigations are 
specifically excluded from the list of prohibited non-audit services that can be undertaken by a company's auditor.
Nevertheless, the fact that the banking regulator has had to turn to Goldman's own auditor to handle the probe 
might be seized upon by critics of the profession as fresh evidence of a lack of choice - as if any more was needed.
QUILTER BIDDERS TRY, TRY AGAIN Could it be a case of third time lucky in the quest to buy Quilter, one of 
Britain's biggest wealth managers? Four years ago, Cinven and Warburg Pincus teamed up to make an offer for the 
company, then part of Old Mutual, the FTSE-100 Anglo-South African financial services group.
That approach failed as Old Mutual prioritised its own orderly break-up through the public markets.
It didn't deter the buyout duo, who I understand tabled an indicative offer of about 190p-a-share for Quilter late last 
year.
Quilter, whose logo now features prominently at England's home rugby union internationals, rejected the proposal, 
although not, I understand, without a level of boardroom disharmony. According to my sources, Paul Feeney, the 
company's chief executive, was in favour of engaging at that level, but chairman Glyn Jones was less convinced.
Significantly, the approach - and its value - was never formally disclosed to investors. After the coronavirus-inspired 
market correction of the last fortnight, shareholders would be forgiven for feeling aggrieved about that. At 
yesterday's close, Quilter shares sat at the comparatively lowly level of 146.80p.
The business remains a work in progress, with a new IT platform and internal restructuring only recently started to 
bear fruit.
The four years between Cinven and Warburg Pincus's approaches have already demonstrated the buyout barons' 
patience. It would be surprising if they didn't return later this year with another attempt to reach Quilter's try line.

VIRGIN bosses were hung out to dry yesterday by Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary for the collapse of failed airline 
Flybe, saying that the regional carrier's "departure will not be missed".
The colourful boss put the blame squarely at the feet of Sir Richard Branson and Delta, who both own significant 
parts of Virgin Atlantic, who in turn partown Flybe.
A witness statement filed by chief Mark Anderson, first reported by Sky News and seen by City A.M., revealed that 
Virgin told Flybe it was "no longer in a position to provide further funding" due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus on 
their own numbers.
It was also revealed that: • Credit card firms had held back almost £50m in cash from Flybe after the firm issued a 
profit warning in October 2018; • Carriers including Ryanair are positioning themselves to fill Flybe's valuable 
landing slots, and; • An international aviation body estimates the combined industry hit of coronavirus will hit 
$113bn (£87.2bn), up from an estimate of $30bn just a fortnight ago.
£ CONTINUES ON P3 CONTINUED FROM FRONT PAGE But the most dramatic intervention was O'Leary's, who 
told Sky News yesterday it was "unfair to blame the UK government or Covid-19" for the airline's demise.
He said: "It's an airline whose business model has never succeeded. It was always going to go bust."
Flybe finally went bankrupt in the early hours yesterday morning after the government refused to offer a £100m loan 
and its owners refused to inject more cash into the carrier.
Virgin pulled the plug on Flybe rescue; Regional carrier finally falls foul of turbulence
Over the last 14 months Virgin Atlantic, part-owned by Delta, has contributed £60m of the £130m its ownership 
consortium with Stobart Air and Cyrus Capital have put into Flybe.
On Wednesday Virgin said its airline chief executive would take a 20 per cent pay cut as part of a raft of measures 
to mitigate the impact of coronavirus.
The witness statement also showed that credit card firms had held back nearly £50m in cash from Flybe since it first 
issued a profit warning in October 2018.
It added that the firm had "deferred supplier payments".
The airline's survival had hinged upon the government loan, but Anderson's statement said that the UK's business 
department had been "reluctant to offer" the money after due diligence was conducted and complaints from rivals 
rolled in.
Flybe's collapse prompted fears over the fate of the UK's regional airports, with many dependent on the airline to 
operate the majority of their routes.
O'Leary said that Ryanair and other airlines had been in contact with these airports over where they could pick up 
the lost capacity. Scottish carrier Loganair moved quickly to secure a number of Flybe's slots at airports north of the 
border.
The government yesterday defended its role in the collapse of the airline. Transport minister Kelly Tolhurst said the 
government had been working "tirelessly" with Flybe's owners to try and drum up emergency cash.

Virgin Atlantic refused to inject more money into Flybe after a sharp drop in its own bookings caused by 
coronavirus, leading to the collapse of the regional airline.
In a witness statement, seen by the Financial Times, Flybe's chief executive Mark Anderson said that the struggling 
UK carrier was informed this week that Virgin Atlantic - one of its three owners - would not stump up further funds. 
He said the decision was prompted by the impact that the virus was having on Virgin's bookings, which are about 
50 per cent lower than a year ago.
Stobart, which also owned 30 per cent of Flybe through the Connect Airways consortium, had previously indicated it 
was also unwilling to offer funding.
The statement was filed to the UK insolvency courts hours before Flybe fell into administration in the early hours of 
yesterday. The collapse of Europe's biggest regional airline puts about 2,400 jobs at risk and raises uncertainty 
over the future of many regional air routes within the UK.
Its failure raises questions over Boris Johnson's commitment to "regional connectivity" after the prime minister let 
the group fold, despite having authorised a rescue package in January.
Kelly Tolhurst, aviation minister, said the government "stands ready" to support regional airports hit by the collapse. 
Grant Shapps, transport secretary, said last night he had written to the regulator to request an "urgent 
Struggling Flybe collapsed after Virgin declined to stump up further funding
reconsideration" of the 80 per cent slot utilisation rule, which forces airlines to fly "ghost flights" to avoid losing their 
airport take-off and landing slots.
Flybe collapsed with about £5.7m of cash available but had payments due to creditors of more than £10m by March 
6. The regional airline had also suffered a 30-40 per cent fall in bookings since February 26, after the virus hit Italy.
The witness statement shed light on No 10's reluctance to back Flybe. Mr Anderson said that between January 12 
and 14 the government was working with the airline to reform domestic airpassenger duty tax, with a change 
possibly included in the March Budget. A rescue package potentially included a loan of up to £100m. However, 
following accusations of state aid by competitors such as British Airways and Ryanair, the government 
reconsidered. Routes in search of airlines page 3 Lex page 14 Carriers face $113bn hit page 15

The spread of the coronavirus outbreak could cost global airlines up to $113bn in lost revenue this year, almost four 
times the estimate of just two weeks ago, the industry's trade body has warned.
The International Air Transport Association said yesterday the industry was in a crisis zone following the rapid 
global spread of the virus over the past week through Europe and the US.
The announcement was made as Southwest Airlines, the world's biggest low-cost carrier, said it expected a $200m-
$300m hit to first-quarter core sales. Revenue per available seat mile - a key industry measure - in the first three 
months is now set to fall compared with the same period last year, against expected growth of at least 3.5 per cent.
The impact on the big US carriers, which in recent years have been the most profitable in the world, appears to be 
increasing. Delta and United Airlines announced further cuts to international and domestic capacity, reflecting the 
sharp drop in passenger demand.
Delta is cutting flights to Japan, while United is reducing international schedules to Asia and Europe by 20 per cent 
and domestic capacity by 10 per cent.
Airlines stand to lose $113bn as coronavirus spreads, warns Iata; ? Trade body's estimate rises fourfold ? 
Passenger numbers slump ? US carriers take hit
Iata said it expected passenger carriers to lose between $63bn and $113bn in revenue in 2020, a much worse 
picture than it painted just two weeks ago, when it predicted a hit of less than $30bn, based largely on the reduction 
in flights to and from China.
"Since that time, the virus has spread to over 80 countries and forward bookings have been severely impacted on 
routes beyond China," Iata said.
Its new scenarios are dependent on how bad the outbreak becomes. The virus helped push Flybe, Europe's largest 
regional carrier, into administration yesterday, while Finnair said it had cancelled 1,100 flights.
Rafael Schvartzman, regional vicepresident at Iata, said Flybe's demise was "proof that urgent action is required 
across Europe to protect air connectivity during a period of almost unprecedented crisis".
The trade body called on regulators this week to suspend rules that mean carriers lose airport landing and takeoff 
slots if they are not used for 80 per cent of the time. Widespread cancellations would mean airlines stood to lose 
their slots or be forced to run empty services to keep their allocations.
"Temporary suspension of slot use rules and a cut in passenger taxes are crucial steps governments can take to 
help," said Mr Schvartzman.
Passenger demand plunged sharply at the weekend, forcing carriers around the world to freeze recruitment and 
slash the number of flights, including on lucrative transatlantic routes. European airlines have stepped up flight 
cancellations in recent days, with British Airways slashing more than 400 flights this month to countries including 
Italy, Germany and the US. Ryanair has also cut short-haul flights to Italy by up to 25 per cent, while Lufthansa and 
easyJet reduced capacity last week.
Airline share prices have fallen nearly 25 per cent since the outbreak began, some 21 percentage points greater 
than the decline during the Sars crisis of 2003.
Iata called on governments to help embattled carriers through the crisis.
"Airlines are doing their best to stay afloat," said Alexandre de Juniac, Iata's chief executive. "As governments look 
to stimulus measures, the airline industry will need consideration for relief on taxes, charges and slot allocation. 
These are extraordinary times."

months is now set to fall compared with the same period last year, against expected growth of at least 3.5 per cent.
The impact on the big US carriers, which in recent years have been the most profitable in the world, appears to be 
increasing. Delta and United Airlines announced further cuts to international and domestic capacity, reflecting the 
sharp drop in passenger demand.
Delta is cutting flights to Japan, while United is reducing international schedules to Asia and Europe by 20 per cent 
and domestic capacity by 10 per cent.
Airlines stand to lose $113bn as coronavirus spreads, warns Iata ? Trade body estimate rises fourfold ? 
Passenger numbers slump ? US carriers take hit
Iata said it expected passenger carriers to lose between $63bn and $113bn in revenue in 2020, a much worse 
picture than it painted just two weeks ago, when it predicted a hit of less than $30bn, based largely on the reduction 
in flights to and from China.
"Since that time, the virus has spread to over 80 countries and forward bookings have been severely impacted on 
routes beyond China," Iata said.
Its new scenarios are dependent on how bad the outbreak becomes. The virus helped push Flybe, Europe's largest 
regional carrier, into administration yesterday, while Finnair said it had cancelled 1,100 flights.
Rafael Schvartzman, regional vicepresident at Iata, said Flybe's demise was "proof that urgent action is required 
across Europe to protect air connectivity during a period of almost unprecedented crisis".
The trade body called on regulators this week to suspend rules that mean carriers lose airport landing and takeoff 
slots if they are not used for 80 per cent of the time. Widespread cancellations would mean airlines stood to lose 
their slots or be forced to run empty services to keep their allocations.
"Temporary suspension of slot use rules and a cut in passenger taxes are crucial steps governments can take to 
help," said Mr Schvartzman.
Passenger demand plunged sharply at the weekend, forcing carriers around the world to freeze recruitment and 
slash the number of flights, including on lucrative transatlantic routes. European airlines have stepped up flight 
cancellations in recent days, with British Airways slashing more than 400 flights this month to countries including 
Italy, Germany and the US. Ryanair has also cut short-haul flights to Italy by up to 25 per cent, while Lufthansa and 
easyJet reduced capacity last week.
Airline share prices have fallen nearly 25 per cent since the outbreak began, some 21 percentage points greater 
than the decline during the Sars crisis of 2003.
Iata called on governments to help embattled carriers through the crisis.
"Airlines are doing their best to stay afloat," said Alexandre de Juniac, Iata's chief executive. "As governments look 
to stimulus measures, the airline industry will need consideration for relief on taxes, charges and slot allocation. 
These are extraordinary times."

The spread of the coronavirus outbreak could cost global airlines up to $113bn in lost revenue this year, almost four 
times the estimate of just two weeks ago, the industry's trade body has warned.
The International Air Transport Association said yesterday the industry was in a crisis zone following the rapid 
global spread of the virus over the past week through Europe and the US.
The announcement was made as Southwest Airlines, the world's biggest low-cost carrier, said it expected a $200m-
$300m hit to first-quarter core sales. Revenue per available seat mile - a key industry measure - in the first three 
months is now set to fall compared with the same period last year, against expected growth of at least 3.5 per cent.

sharp drop in passenger demand.

and domestic capacity by 10 per cent.

IATA's New Forecast Adds Gloom to Coronavirus-Hit Airlines

Mar 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The fast-evolving 
coronavirus outbreak rattled stock markets globally. Almost all sectors are reeling under its effects. However, it is 
the travel industry that is the worst hit. The dreaded coronavirus, having first emerged in Wuhan, China, now spread 
its tentacles to 86 more countries claiming the lives of more than 3,300 people and infecting over 95,000. As of Mar 
6, United States reported in excess of 225 confirmed cases of the virus and a death toll of 12.Given the rapid 
spread of the virus and the consequent plunge in air travel demand, airlines across the globe are trimming capacity 
on international routes. 
For instance, American Airlines AAL[1] suspended flights connecting Dallas with China, Hong Kong and Seoul due 
to lackluster demand following the coronavirus outbreak. The carrier also decided to call off all U.S. flights to Milan, 
Italy. Fellow U.S. carriers, namely United Airlines UAL[2] and Delta Air Lines DAL[3] also suspended multiple flights 
citing the same issue.Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines LTM[4] also cancelled Milan flights from Sao Paulo. 
Due to significant drop in bookings, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[5] fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ending Mar 31, 2020) 
results are likely to be heavily impacted. Notably, Ryanair will cut 25% of its Italian capacity for the Mar 17-Apr 8 
time frame. Also, Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa DLAKY[6], which has exposure to Italy and China, reportedly 
decided to ground 150 of its planes due to weak demand.Among U.S. airlines, United Airlines, carrying a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold), is seemingly experiencing the maximum downfall. Flight cancellation apart, the carrier took some 
dramatic measures, such as putting a halt to hiring (except for crucial roles), delaying 2019 merit salary increases 
as well as giving employees the option to apply for unpaid leave of absence voluntarily. Per CFRA analyst Colin 
Scarola, the carrier reportedly generates approximately 40% of total revenues from international route and has 
greater international exposure among U.S. airlines. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[7].The drab picture surrounding the airlines is well reflected in the industry's price performance so 
far this year. The Zacks Airline[8] industry has declined 27.5% in a month compared with the S...00 Index's 9.3% 
decrease.IATA Projects Higher Revenue Loss for 2020Given the vast majority of countries that the virus outbreak 
has spread to and the resultant slump in forward bookings, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) now 
anticipates global passenger revenue loss of $63-$113 billion for 2020. This is significantly higher than the previous 
projection of a $29.3-billion passenger revenue loss when its estimate was based on the assumption that the 
coronavirus-led low demand would impact mostly the Chinese market.The research firm anticipates a $63-billion 
passenger revenue impact, equivalent to an 11% decline, assuming that the outbreak will mostly impact demand in 
IATA's New Forecast Adds Gloom to Coronavirus-Hit Airlines
Asia-Pacific (China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea), Europe (France, Italy, Germany) and the Middle East (Iran). 
The markets included here have more than 100 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease as of Mar 2. Within the 
$63 billion loss, China's share equals $22.2 billion, translating to a 23% decline in passenger numbers. Moreover, 
Asia is expected to suffer a loss of $47 billion.In case the health hazard spreads to a larger extent affecting demand 
in Asia-Pacific (Australia, PR of China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam), Europe 
(Austria, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom), Middle 
East (Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates) and North America (Canada, United States), 
the IATA anticipates a $113-billion toll (or 19% decline) on global passenger revenues in the current year. The 
markets included here currently have 10 or more confirmed cases of the disease as of Mar 2. The Asia-Pacific 
countries alone are estimated to witness a 32% decrease in passenger numbers, equivalent to a $57.3-billion 
revenue loss. The European market is likely to report the second largest revenue loss of $43.9 billion, implying a 
33% drop in passenger numbers. Canada and the United States are estimated to bear a loss worth $21.1 billion 
with 10% fall in passengers transported.Is the Worst Coming for Airlines?The impact of the coronavirus on the 
airline industry is already seen to be more damaging than the SARS outbreak in 2003. Additionally, it is worth 
nothing that China, which accounts for roughly 20% of the global GDP, is more important to the global economic 
scenario now than it was in 2003. Consequently, any slowdown in the Chinese economy will have ramifications 
across the globe.As uncertainty looms large on the extent and duration of the virus, it is perhaps not far off for the 
industry to endure a situation similar to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. In fact, the IATA's forecast of a $113-
billion passenger revenue loss for 2020 is nearly commensurate with what the airlines had faced during the financial 
crisis of 2008.With substantial decline in oil prices since the beginning of 2020, the IATA expects fuel cost saving of 
up to $28 billion for the ongoing year over and above the savings from reduced capacity. This should provide some 
cushion to the airlines in dealing with this deep crisis.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the 
early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of 
electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it's 
expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most 
as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s.

RYAAY[5].Industry: Air TravelLink: 
https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/798003/coronavirus-upends-air-travel-as-growth-slumps-to-decade-low[6]That 
the rapid spread of the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) rattled stock markets globally is a well-known fact now. 
Having also gripped other parts of the world beyond China — its country of origin — this health hazard is speedily 
assuming pandemic proportions. Notably, this highly contagious disease severely affected countries like Italy, South 
Korea, Iran and Japan. It sounded the death knell for a considerable part of the global populace, having already 
claimed numerous lives apart from infecting many more,While almost all sectors are reeling under its impact , the 
airline space has been one of the worst-hit pockets. The coronavirus spread foiled air-travel plans with many people 
unwilling to take to the skies in a bid to stay safe and avoid contracting the disease from a fellow passenger.IATA's 
January Traffic Report Reveals Drab ScenarioAccording to Alexandre de Juniac, director general and CEO of the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA), passenger traffic growth across the globe in January 2020 was the 
slowest in a decade. Notably, demand (measured in total revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) climbed only 
2.4% in the month on a year-over-year basis, signaling the lowest monthly increase since Apr 2010.Overall capacity 
(available seat kilometers or ASKs) inched up 1.7% in the first month of this year. With traffic growth outpacing 
capacity expansion in the month, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) rose 0.6 percentage points to 
80.3%.Understandably, the Asia-Pacific region (which includes China) witnessed a meager 0.4% year-over-year 
growth in demand in the period. Notably, in January, the viral attack was mostly restricted to China with the city of 
Wuhan in Hubei province surfacing as the epicenter of the disease. Additionally, demand for domestic travel in 
China was the worst, contracting 6.8% year over year in the same month.Traffic Scenario Likely to WorsenJuniac 
termed the January traffic performance of airlines as the 'tip of the iceberg' as 'major travel restrictions in China did 
not begin until Jan 23'. In the opening month of the ongoing year, the health scare was only confined to China and 
was still considered an epidemic.With air-travel demand taking a beating from the fast-evolving coronavirus, airlines 
from all corners of the globe are trimming their capacity. For instance, American Airlines suspended flights

Ryanair
connecting Dallas with China, Hong Kong and Seoul due to lackluster demand following the coronavirus outbreak. 
The carrier also decided to call off all U.S. flights to Milan, Italy, again on account of this soft air-travel demand 
induced by the coronavirus. Fellow U.S. carriers, namely United Airlines and Delta Air Lines also suspended 
multiple flights citing the same issue.Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines also cancelled its daily flight connecting 
Sao Paulo and Milan through Apr 16 because of tepid demand post the coronavirus outbreak. Moreover, the virus 
being rampant in Italy, two of the biggest players in the Italian market, namely, Ryanair Holdings, which sports a 
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and easyJet, took a massive hit from this health disaster.You can seethe complete list 
of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7].Notably, Ryanair will cut 25% of its Italian capacity for the Mar 17-Apr 8 
time frame. As a result of this anticipated decline in bookings, the carrier's CEO Michael O'Leary warned of a 
"meaningful impact" of the virus on fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ending Mar 31, 2020) results.The sorry state of affairs 
for airlines, as highlighted above, is well-reflected by the price performance of the ZacksAirline[8]industry. In the 
past month, the industry has plunged 25.1% compared with the S...00 Index's loss of 10%.Final WordA slew of 
flight cancellations and dwindling air-travel demand (many carriers are 'reporting 50% no-shows across several 
markets' per IATA) point to a bleak near-term future for airlines. Consequently, the traffic performance, which 
touched rock bottom in a decade in January, is likely to deteriorate in the coming months. So it is not for nothing 
that the IATA currently expects airline revenues for 2020 to be hurt in excess of$29 billion[9]. In fact, the projection 
may further worsen. Watch this space for more updates on the coronavirus onslaught and its resultant impact on

Coronavirus crisis intensifies for airlines as UK's Flybe collapses
Coronavirus crisis intensifies for airlines as UK's Flybe collapses
Business World (Digest)

 The worsening coronavirus epidemic heaped fresh misery on the airlines sector on Thursday, as British regional 
carrier Flybe became the first big casualty of a slump in travel demand and Norwegian Air scrapped its profit 
guidance for this year.
Airlines across the world are rushing to cut flights and costs, and warning of a hit to earnings, as a new virus that 
started in China spreads around the world, raising fears of a pandemic that could plunge the global economy into 
recession.
In a sign of the difficulties this is creating for airlines, a Turkish Airlines jet was flown back to Istanbul without any 
passengers on board on Thursday on orders from Singapore after a passenger who had arrived on the same plane 
on Tuesday tested positive for the virus.
Finnish national airline Finnair, meanwhile, said the impact of the new coronavirus, which has claimed more than 
3,000 lives and infected tens of thousands more in over 60 countries, would be worse than the SARS epidemic in 
2003.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned on Feb. 20 of a potential $29 billion hit to airlines' 
revenues this year, but that was before fresh travel restrictions put in place by several countries as the virus gained 
a stronger hold outside of China, in places such as Italy, Iran and South Korea.
Among the latest events to be canceled around this world due to the crisis is the world air traffic management 
congress in Madrid, which had been scheduled for March 10-12.
Coronavirus crisis intensifies for airlines as UK's Flybe collapses
The failure of British regional airline Flybe comes less than two months after a rescue due for the company was 
agreed by its owners and the UK government.
Despite its commitment to improving regional transport links, the British government backed away from that deal 
due to the scale of the hit to demand from the virus outbreak.
"All flights have been grounded and the UK business has ceased trading with immediate effect," Flybe said as it 
entered administration, a form of protection from creditors.
The failure of the airline, which has long struggled with losses, not only puts around 2,400 jobs at risk but could also 
see some regional UK airports struggle and business travel hit.
Flybe carried around eight million passengers a year between 81 airports and was owned by a consortium of Virgin 
Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital.
Its collapse came a day after Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary predicted that the coronavirus crisis would 
lead to bankruptcies.
"It's inevitable in the next couple of weeks we'll see more failures," O'Leary told Reuters - citing Flybe as among the 
most vulnerable.
"Where you have a massive short-term decline in bookings you have a massive short-term decline in cash flow," he 
said on the sidelines of an industry event in Brussels on Tuesday.
Norwegian, a pioneer of low-cost transatlantic travel, has also been struggling for years due to cut-throat 
competition and heavy debts built up during rapid expansion.
The company, which has repeatedly raised cash from shareholders in order to stay in business, said on Thursday it 
was scrapping its 2020 earnings guidance, which had predicted a return to profit after three years of losses, due to 
the drop in travel demand and disruption caused by the virus.
It also said it would cancel 22 long-haul flights between Europe and the United States from March 28 to May 5, with 
routes from Rome to Los Angeles, Boston and New York seeing a reduced number of departures.
In addition, it will cut the number of flights between London and New York, flying twice, rather than three times, on 
some days.
"At this stage, it is too early to assess the full impact on our business," it said in a statement.
Norwegian shares, which have lost more than 50% of their value this year, were down more than 3% at 0820 GMT.
Willie Walsh, the outgoing CEO of British Airways parent IAG , also warned governments this week against any 
temptation to prop up airlines that were already struggling.
"I don't believe it's appropriate for governments to provide state aid to airlines that were not sustainable before the 
coronavirus," he said at the Brussels gathering. (Reuters)

UK regional airline Flybe has officially folded after failing to secure the loan from the government.
In January 2020, Flybe arranged a deal with the British government for a £100m loan and deferred payment of 
more than $130m of Air Passenger Duty (APD) payments. After the agreement, Flybe tweeted: "Flybe remains 
committed to providing exceptional air connectivity for the UK regions with the full support of its shareholders." 
However, there were predictions that the airline would not receive the financial aid, costing 2,000 jobs and 
significantly effecting the UK's regional connectivity.
Regional air connectivity will be majorly affected in response to the collapse, described as "disastrous" for the UK, 
with 88 of the 120 routes flown by airline not operated by any other carrier. In four of its UK airports, Flybe operated 
more than 70% of flights: Anglesey, Belfast City, Exeter, and Southampton, meaning local economies are expected 
to be impacted too.
The UK government responded to the news by stating that it was willing to help workers find new jobs: "We are 
working closely with industry to minimize any disruption to routes operated by Flybe, including by looking urgently at 
how routes not already covered by other airlines can be re-established by the industry."
In response to the collapse, European airline Ryanair has launched flights to help those that may have been 
disturbed. Routes will include Liverpool-Knock, Bournemouth-Dublin, Belfast-London Stansted, Bristol-Dublin and 
Belfast-Manchester. Alejandra Ruiz, the airline's Sales & Marketing Manager said, "We are working closely with the 
CAA to accommodate passengers who may have been left stranded or have had their travel plans disrupted by the 
collapse of the airline."
Over recent years, Flybe suffered from the accumulation of high fuel costs, currency fluctuations and Brexit 
uncertainty. In 2019, the airline was bought by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic, said to provide £30m to 
the business. Beside this, it was hoped that the "£100m lifeline" and a push for change to the APD tax could aid the 
airline. Whilst most competitors currently pay £13 per passenger in APD, Flybe hoped that figure would be halved. 
However, due to negative responses from other companies within the aviation industry, any alterations were not 
permitted which left Flybe struggling still.
Flybe folds as funding fails
More recently, the outbreak of the coronavirus added to the airline's impending downfall as it "made a bad situation 
much worse." The epidemic caused a decrease in the demand for air travel and seems to be preventing other 
airlines wanting to take over the routes lost along with Flybe.
Mark Anderson, Flybe's Chief Executive commented, "Despite every effort, we now have no alternative - having 
failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading. I am very sorry that we have not been able to secure the 
funding needed to continue to deliver our turnaround."
Flybe began attempts to re-establish itself in the industry over the last 10 years, aiming to adapt its fleet and fly the 
comparably larger Embraer ERJ-170 and ERJ-190 within its network. This did not work, which left them paying for 
four aircraft that they could not use.
Flights have been cancelled, aircraft seized, and the website vanquished. Anderson added, "The UK has lost one of 
its greatest regional assets. Flybe has been a key part of the UK aviation industry for four decades, connecting 
regional communities, people and businesses across the entire nation."

Mar 05, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  British regional 
airline Flybe crashed into bankruptcy Thursday after the deadly coronavirus proved to be the final nail in its 
coffin.The biggest operator of UK domestic flights said it has sunk into administration -- a last-ditch process aimed 
at salvaging at least some of the company.And with the carrier long blighted by fierce competition, volatile fuels 
costs and a weak pound linked to the uncertainty over Brexit, Flybe's announcement to ground all flights now 
places some 2,000 jobs at risk.An airline source told Britain's domestic Press Association news agency that sliding 
demand owing to COVID-19 had "made a difficult situation worse". Flybe, which employs 2,000 people, had failed 
to turn around its fortunes Photo: AFP / Oli SCARFF A slew of airlines -- including British Airways and Ryanair -- 
announced Monday the cancellation of several hundred flight, in particular to Italy, as the novel coronavirus spreads 
throughout the globe. Flybe narrowly avoided going bust in January when the UK government agreed to review air 
passenger duty paid by its customers -- and shareholders pledged extra investment.But in the early hours of 
Thursday, the carrier appointed administrators after the government reportedly refused a rescue loan for ?100 
million ($128 million, 115 million euros) "Flybe entered administration on 5 March," the carrier said in a brief 
statement."All flights have been grounded and the UK business has ceased trading with immediate effect." 
Flybe operates from 43 airports across Europe and 28 in Britain, and its collapse left potentially thousands of 
people stranded far from home Photo: AFP / PETER MUHLY The Exeter-based carrier failed to turn around its 
fortunes since it was purchased just over a year ago by a consortium led by Virgin."Flybe's financial difficulties were 
long-standing and well documented and pre-date the outbreak of COVID-19," said a government statement.Flybe, 
which flies about eight million passengers annually, is owned also by investment firm Cyrus and infrastructure 
specialist Stobart. Factfile on British airline Flybe which collapsed Thursday Photo: AFP / STAFF Flybe operates 
from 43 airports across Europe and 28 in Britain, and its collapse left potentially thousands of people stranded far 
from home.The British government said it had asked bus and train operators to accept Flybe tickets and other 
airlines to offer reductions to help passengers reach their destination.Flybe's owner, the Connect Airways 
consortium, said "every possible attempt" had been made to avoid the collapse, but that the airline had been 
"unable to overcome significant funding challenges".At the start of the year, Flybe agreed a payment plan with 
authorities to defer tax payments of less than ?10 million.That announcement came just days after the airline was 
saved from collapse in a last-minute financial rescue, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government 
agreeing to review air passenger duty (APD) paid by Flybe's customers.Following the tax deferral, rival companies, 
including British Airways-parent IAG, complained to the European Union that it was receiving unfair state aid.The 
government said its assistance did not breach EU rules and that help was based on the importance of the 
UK Airline Flybe Dealt Final Blow By Coronavirus
company's domestic services.Flybe's demise follows a timely coronavirus warning from Dublin-based low-cost 
airline Ryanair at the start of this week.The Irish carrier forecast that the fatal outbreak -- which has killed 3,200 and 
infected 95,000 worldwide so far -- would spark more European airline failures."We expect that this COVID-19 virus 
will result in further EU airline failures over the coming weeks," Ryanair said Monday.Recent high-profile casualties 
in Europe's battered aviation sector include French carriers Aigle Azur and XL Airways, as well as Slovenia's Adria 
Airways and Britain's Thomas Cook, which was both a tour operator and an airline.In contrast to Flybe, Thomas 
Cook collapsed without any government assistance in September, causing the loss of 22,000 jobs worldwide and 
stranding 600,000 holidaymakers abroad.

Mar 05, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  KEY 
POINTSFlybe was burdene by heavy debt and unprofitable routesAirline executives warn other air carriers are at 
risk of bankruptcyIATA warned airlines could lose up to $113 billion this year The collapse of Britain's regional 
carrier Flybe has raised worries over what other airlines may suffer the same fate.Flybe, already burdened by heavy 
debts, an onerous tax duty, rising fuel costs, falling demand and struggles to turn a profit on its domestic routes, 
finally went under due to the impact of the coronavirus sweeping across the world.More than 2,000 jobs may be lost 
at Flybe, but the crisis has ensnared many other airlines, big and small.A few days prior, Willie Walsh, chief 
executive of International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways and Aer Lingus, warned that the impact of the 
virus outbreak would be enough to push some failing airlines 'over the edge.''We [IAG] are well able to adjust to this 
situation because our business is in great shape. It's the failing airlines who will be most affected by this -- so 
without question, there will be more consolidation as a result,' he said.However, British Airways has itself cut many 
of its transatlantic services due to weakening demand.Miles Brignall wrote in The Guardian[1] that other airlines, 
including Richard Branson's Virgin Group - which was a co-owner of Flybe -- are more directly exposed than Flybe 
to the crisis, having already cancelled major Chinese routes and then witnessing a drop in demand. 
On Wednesday, Brignall noted, Virgin unveiled emergency measures, including reducing executive pay and asking 
other staff to take unpaid leave, after reservations were cut in half in recent days. Other budget carriers, like 
Ryanair (RYAAY[2]) and EasyJet have cancelled hundreds of flights to virus-torn Italy, as well as other 
locales.'There are lots of airlines that have got relatively narrow profit margins and lots of debt, and a cash flow 
shock like this could certainly send some into a very difficult situation,' said International Air Transport Association's 
Chief Economist Brian Pearce.Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said it was 'inevitable' the coronavirus crisis will lead 
to more airline bankruptcies.Already, a slew of airlines has issued profit warnings arising from virus-related 
woes.U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines predicted a $200-300 million loss in its first-quarter operating revenues.'Firms 
are restricting business travel, and international conferences are being axed by the day, pulling the most valuable 
customers from the traditional carriers,' the Guardian wrote. 'If further public health measures are needed and 
demand tumbles throughout the peak period, more airline casualties can be expected.'The Wall Street Journal[3] 
described Flybe's collapse as the 'first coronavirus bankruptcy.''[Flybe] is the epidemic's first victim in the airline 
sector, which is under pressure not just because of route cancellations to regions under quarantine, but also 
expectations of a sharp slowdown in economic growth,' the Journal grimly warned.Moreover, on Thursday, the 
IATA[4] estimated that global air carriers could suffer revenue losses of anywhere between $63 billion to $113 
billion this year depending upon the duration and magnitude of the virus. (On Feb. 20, IATA had forecast a hit to the 
Coronavirus Pushes Flybe Into Collapse, But Other Airlines May Follow
industry of $29 billion.)IATA noted that airline share prices have dropped almost 25% since the virus outbreak 
began, some 21% points more than the decline witnessed at a similar point during the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, crisis of 2003.'The turn of events as a result of [coronavirus] is almost without precedent,' said 
Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's director-general and CEO. 'In little over two months, the industry's prospects in much 
of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. It is unclear how the virus will develop.'De Juniac added that 
'many airlines are cutting capacity and taking emergency measures to reduce costs. Governments must take note. 
Airlines are doing their best to stay afloat as they perform the vital task of linking the world's economies. As 
governments look to stimulus measures, the airline industry will need consideration for relief on taxes, charges and 
slot allocation. These are extraordinary times.'Indeed, ForwardKeys, a global travel industry data provider[5], said 
on Thursday that new flight reservations to Europe from other parts of the world plunged by 79% in the last week of 
February.'The drop-off in bookings to Italy is even worse than we have observed in the past for some of the most 
disruptive events such as terror attacks,' sais ForwardKeys' Vice President Olivier Ponti.The Guardian noted that it 
took global airlines five years[6] to become profitable after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, losing more than $40 billion in 
the process. The financial crisis of 2008 also damaged airlines, when it lost $8 billion.Now as airlines drastically cut 
services to places like China, South Korea, Italy and Iran, many of them cannot accurately estimate their annual 
losses since the virus seems to get worse every day.Andrew Lobbenberg, an HSBC analyst, pointed out that while 
Air France-KLM projected a 200 million euro [$224 million] hit from coronavirus until the end of May, 'the widening 
of the outbreak across Asia and into Italy makes the company's estimate redundant. It is very hard to assess how 
long and how significant an impact we should expect.'Andrew Charlton, managing director of Aviation Advocacy, an 
independent air transport consultancy, said airlines are facing a three-pronged problem.'The first is their staff they 
can't risk flying them somewhere where they might get sick,' he said. 'The second is the market. Demand for Venice 
and Milan [in Italy] has fallen through the floor, and there's no point in trundling around with empty airplanes. The 
third is watching out for if a pandemic is declared - there will be all sorts of legal obligation to what they can and 
can't do.'Charlton emphasized many airlines are at grave risk.'It's a question of how much cash reserves they have, 
how agile they can be,' he said. 'On the upside, fuel prices are falling, interest rates are low and governments are 
looking at what they can do. But we shall see if smaller airlines can survive.'John Strickland, an analyst with JLS 
Consulting, also painted a bleak picture for the industry.'Airline revenue management staff will be looking by the 
hour at booking trends, to see where demand is dropping,' he said. 'This is not a situation where airlines can 
stimulate demand - they simply have to acknowledge it. There are limits to redeployment - you need a lead time of 
six to eight weeks to get a decent level of bookings to make it worth flying. It's not a simple matter.' [ 1]:

Virgin Atlantic is cutting the pay of its chief executive by 20 per cent for four months as it becomes the latest airline 
to take emergency measures to protect profitability after the coronavirus hit to passenger demand.
The British carrier yesterday said chief executive Shai Weiss had agreed to reduce his pay between April and July, 
while its executive leadership team will take a salary cut of 15 per cent.
Virgin Atlantic's move comes as airlines around the world are freezing recruitment and slashing the number of 
flights in the wake of the spreading virus.
Iata, the airline trade body, will today significantly increase its estimate of the hit to global sales because of the 
virus. Just 13 days ago it estimated a near-$30bn impact, but this was based largely on the impact in Asia.
The FT reported on Tuesday that Virgin Atlantic had suffered a 40 per cent drop in customer demand compared 
with March 2019, in a sign concerns were hitting demand on long-haul flights, not just short-haul flights in Europe.
European airlines have stepped up flight cancellations in recent days, with British Airways slashing more than 400 
flights between March 16 and 28 to countries including Italy, Germany and the US.
Ryanair has also cut short-haul flights to Italy by up to 25 per cent between March 17 and April 8, while Lufthansa 
and easyJet cut capacity last week.

On Wednesday, Hungary-based carrier Wizz Air said it would reduce its flight schedule, mainly to Italian 
destinations, over the coming month. The low-cost airline said it would also consider a further 10 per cent capacity 
reduction in the quarter beginning in April, depending on how much further demand is hit by the spread of the virus.
Wizz has already cut overheads, relocated staff and implemented a hiring freeze in a bid to keep spending down.
Virgin Atlantic said it would delay the start of its London Heathrow to São Paulo service, which was due to begin on 
March 29, until the winter season with services commencing from October 5. The carrier has already suspended its 
London Heathrow to Shanghai service until April 19 and reduced the frequency of its Hong Kong route. Additional

FLYBE LOSES BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL; Administration expected for Flybe as regional carrier fights to the 
end
FLYBE LOSES BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL; Administration expected for Flybe 
as regional carrier fights to the end

EMBATTLED airline Flybe appeared to have all but collapsed last night as the firm's long-running survival bid 
seemed to be heading for failure.
An official announcement that the regional carrier - the largest operator of routes within the UK and one which is 
vital to a number of smaller airports - has entered administration is expected.
Late last night Flybe's website was unavailable and social media posts carried images of seizure notices placed on 
grounded Flybe aircraft.
The firm's troubled start to the year took a rapid turn for the worse yesterday morning when reports emerged that 
discussions between the airline and the government over a £100m loan had come to naught.
The loan had become increasingly vital to the airline as coronavirus fears took their toll on passenger numbers, and 
an already debt-laden balance sheet.
As rumours spread of an imminent collapse, the cancellation of a Flybe flight from Manchester to Southampton as it 
was taxiing away from the terminal appeared to confirm the worst fears. The failure of the airline, which served 
more than a hundred destinations, has put more than 2,000 jobs at risk.
The airline's slow demise began last year when it had to be rescued from insolvency by Connect Airways - a 
consortium made up of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and Cyrus Capital.
FLYBE LOSES BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL; Administration expected for Flybe as regional carrier fights to the 
end
It was granted a further stay of execution in January, when then-business secretary Andrea Leadsom and Flybe 
bosses agreed a package of measures, including deferral of air passenger duty payments and a potential loan in 
exchange for a £30m cash injection from the consortium.
The salvage deal itself was a matter of significant controversy, with many rival firms questioning what it saw as an 
inappropriate use of taxpayer funds.
But with any changes to air passenger duty forbidden until the end of the UK's transition period under EU state aid 
rules and the impact of Covid-19 on traveller numbers, the firm ran out of lifelines.
Flybe provided a vital regional air link around the UK and is crucial to the viability of a number of UK airports.
According to Cirium Data, Flybe flights accounted for 95 per cent of departures from Southampton airport in 2019, 
as well as nearly 80 per cent at both Belfast City and Exeter. Other UK carriers will be assessing the value of 
Flybe's landing slots at regional airports over the coming days. Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw said the collapse, 
hastened by the government's decision not to offer the loan, made "a mockery of [Boris] Johnson's 'levelling up' 
rhetoric".
£ CONTINUES ON P2 CONTINUED FROM FRONT PAGE Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald 
said the collapse would "cause real anxiety in many regions throughout the country".
But during the crisis in January, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary weighed in on the government's proposed loan, 
saying in an interview with the Times: "If Branson and Delta (part owners of Virgin Atlantic) won't put their hands in 
their pockets, why should the taxpayer?" EY is expected to handle the administration once it is announced.
As the news became clear late last night, the Press Association reported that planes were not being refuelled.
Virus fears have hit consumer confidence, with knock-on effects on travel. A number of airlines have cancelled 
flights to ready for an extended period of lower demand, while British Airways is attempting to hold on to business 
by removing its cancellation fees on holidays booked now.
The pressures on aviation travel operators saw Thomas Cook collapse in similar dramatic late night circumstances 
last year.
Eastern Airlines and Blue Island, which operate routes from Flybe, are not part of the administration.

Alt Text Flybe  Struggling airline goes into administration after government rejected appeal In Depth[1] Thursday, 
March 5, 2020 - 6:44am Flybe has gone into administration after the coronavirus proved the be the final nail in the 
coffin of the struggling airline. The carrier entered administration overnight, with all flights grounded and the 
business ceasing trading 'with immediate effect'. Earlier, Flybe[2] boss Mark Anderson had sent an email to 
theairline's 2,000 staff saying it was 'shortly being put into administration'.What happened?The Exeter-based airline 
ran into difficulties last year and was bought by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic. 
Itnarrowly avoided going bust in January[3], but yesterday said it had ultimately failed to overcome its'significant 
funding challenges'. See related Thomas Cook collapse: who is to blame?[4] Why Flybe's rescue is causing 
controversy[5] Flybe saved: but why is the airline industry struggling?[6] 'Months of talks with the government failed 
to secure a crucial 100m loan and the deadly coronavirus slashed demand,' says the Financial Times[7]. The 
Guardian[8]says that other airlines, led by British Airways owner IAG and Ryanair, had objected about the prospect 
of state aid and threatened legal action. Unite national officer, Oliver Richardson, said: 'For central government not 
to support and nurture this, especially as we deal with the twin uncertainties of the Covid-19 virus and the changes 
that will come with Brexit, is unhelpful and irresponsible.' Anderson explained that 'while our shareholders and the 
leadership team have worked with the government and key suppliers to try to get the funding and support needed, 
this has not materialised'. He added: 'The coronavirus has impacted both our shareholders and ourselves and has 
put additional pressure on an already difficult situation.' In response to the collapse, Transport Secretary Grant 
Shapps said the government is 'absolutely gutted, really'. 'We really tried to do everything we could back at the turn 
of the year but unfortunately though, with the situation that's developed with coronavirus, an already weak company 
just hasn't been able to survive,' he said. The bankruptcy comes a week before government is due to unveil its 
2020Budget[9], which Flybe hoped would help bolster its precarious finances, after the previous chancellor said he 
would look again at levels of air passenger duty. -------------------------------For a round-up ofthe most important

customers to 'not travel to the airport' unless they have arranged an alternative flight. The BBC[12] says 'there are 
no alternatives for most people other than to book another flight' and a 'refund from the airline is highly unlikely'. It

adds that passengers will have to 'rely on a refund from their credit or debit card provider, or possibly by claiming

at an event in Madrid recently, attended by over 60 travel and lifestyle journalists. 
Attendees including representatives of Cond Nast Traveller, National Geographic, El Mundo and 5 Das, as well as 
popular bloggers and social influencers. Partners from the island of Ireland were also in attendance including Taste 
...ur NI, showcasing produce like Young Buck cheese, Ispini charcuterie and Abernethy Butter; and the Kinsale 
Food Circle, showcasing Blacks of Kinsale Gin, Kinsale Mead and Koko Chocolates. Kinsale and Cork is the area 
of Ireland with which Tourism Ireland in Spain is 'twinned' for 2020. 'In 2019, we welcomed around 443,000 Spanish 
arrivals to Ireland,' said Barbara Wood, Tourism Ireland's Manager Spain. 'Our Fill Your Heart With Ireland 
campaign is now live, targeting Spanish travellers on video websites and social platforms. We are also rolling out a 
number of co-operative campaigns with partners like Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Iberia Express and Logitravel.' 
[embedded content] The organisation is placing a greater focus in 2020 on driving growth to less visited attractions 
and locations, as well as on driving business in the off-peak and shoulder seasons. Around 37% of all Spanish 
visitors to Ireland arrive in the off-season months (Q1 and Q4) and Tourism Ireland sees this as an opportunity to 
win business at a time when there is capacity in accommodation and other tourism facilities. Tourism Ireland will roll 
out a TV, outdoor and digital campaign with Aer Lingus this spring, promoting fares on flights from Barcelona to 
Shannon and Cork. Tourism Ireland will also work with Ryanair, from the end of February until the end of March, 
promoting flights from Girona to Shannon and from Madrid and Barcelona to Dublin. Other joint campaigns this 
spring will see include work with Iberia Express and with online travel agents such as Logitravel and Atrapalo.

Mar 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines Holdings 
Inc UAL[1] is planning some dramatic capacity reductions and stringent cost controls as the airline battles against 
receding air travel demand from the fast-evolving coronavirus outbreak.In a first by any U.S. airline, the carrier 
plans to trim domestic capacity by 10%. The Chicago, IL-based airline intends to cut back U.S. and Canadian flights 
by 10% as well as slash capacity on international schedule by 20% in April. The flight schedule reductions might 
continue in May as well.Simultaneously, United Airlines is putting a stop to hiring (except for crucial roles) at least 
through Jun 30. Also, 2019 merit salary increases for all management and administrative employees is being 
postponed from April 1 to July 1. This excludes employees falling under the collective bargaining agreements, who 
will continue to receive timely increments.The plight of the carrier can be further gauged from the airlines' decision 
giving employees the option to apply for unpaid leave of absence voluntarily. In some cases, they can also ask for a 
reduced work schedule.With the airline reportedly having greater international exposure among all U.S. airlines, the 
novel coronavirus outbreak, having already spread to more than 75 countries across the globe infecting more than 
95,000 people and claiming over 3,200 lives, is clearly taking a significant toll on its prospects.Coronavirus-Led Low 
Demand Weighs on SharesEarlier in the month, United Airlines cancelled its investor day amid uncertainty 
surrounding its long-term strategy, considering how unclear the extent and duration of the viral outbreak is. 
The carrier already withdrew[2] its 2020 outlook.With a substantial drop in demand, the carrier extended the 
suspension of its U.S. flights to mainland China and Hong Kong through Apr 30, 2020 from the previous 
cancellation through Apr 24. Additionally, the airline reduced approximately two thirds of its flights to Seoul, a third 
of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. Moreover, the Chicago, IL-based airline is operating some 
routes on a smaller aircraft due to slackened demand.To counteract the waning demand situation and encourage 
customers to travel without worrying over change in travel plans, United Airlines recently waived change fees on 
bookings through Mar 31. Customers can cancel tickets (in exchange for another ticket for travel within 12 months 
from the date of issuance of the ticket) without any change fees.Amid this turbulence, shares of the company have 
plunged more than 26% in a month's time.Viral Outbreak Rattles Airline IndustryConcerns over the rapidly-
spreading virus outbreak has crippled the entire airline industry by significantly lowering travel demand. In 
response, numerous airlines across the globe, including Delta Air Lines DAL[3], American Airlines AAL[4], Ryanair 
Holdings and LATAM Airlines are trimming capacity. JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] also plans to cut capacity by 
approximately 5%[6] "in the near term to address the fall in demand". The airline is also taking other cost-control

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday he would welcome the "lunatics" of the Green Party 
entering government in Ireland as part of ongoing coalition talks as this would mean they would be forced to 
"confront reality."
The Green Party says it is in the interests of business to introduce sharp cuts to carbon emissions to avoid hugely 
costly disruption to global climate patterns. A key measure it is planning is the re-introduction of an Irish air 
passenger travel tax, which was scrapped in 2011.
With 12 of 160 parliamentary seats, the Green Party likely to be a kingmaker when it comes to forming a 
government and is expected to join two of the three big parties - center-right Fine Gael and Fianna Fail or left-wing 
nationalist Sinn Fein - which each have just under a quarter of the seats.
But forming a government could take months. It took 70 days to form an administration after the last election in 
2016.
O'Leary, whose airline Ryanair is one of the biggest carbon emitters in Europe, has in the past called 
environmentalists "luddites."
"By all means I think you put all the lunatics in government and let them deal with reality. It's a far better outcome 
than keeping them on opposition benches where they never have to confront reality," O'Leary told Reuters.
"I've never been concerned about the Greens entering government in any of the European countries."
Ryanair CEO says 'lunatic' Green promises will not work
"In many respects it's good to have the Greens in government because you tend to have more sensible polices than 
the wish-lists they produce in opposition."
O'Leary said he was similarly sanguine about Sinn Fein in government, whose economic policies he described as 
"nuts."
Sinn Fein stunned the establishment by beating the two center-right parties that have led every government 
in Ireland's history, attracting a new generation of voters with promises on housing, childcare and insurance costs, 
alongside its historic goal of reunifying the British region of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland.
"I think by all means ... let them loose in government and say, right, now let's see how you do. I think they'll do 
particularly badly and they'll roll back on most of their policy initiatives," he said
"As they say, campaigning is poetry and governing is prose." (Reuters)

The European Commission has opened an in-depth investigation to assess whether operating aid granted to 
Béziers airport, as well as marketing and airport services agreements concluded between Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) 
and the French regional airport operators are in line with EU state aid rules, according to a press release. The 
commission received a complaint concerning operating aid granted to the successive operators in Béziers from 
2007 to today. The airport was owned and managed from 2007 to 2011 by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
of Béziers St Pons, and since 2011 by the joint venture "Pôle aéroportuaire Béziers Cap d'Agde Hérault - 
Occitanie". The latter is exclusively composed of local and regional public authorities.

AIRLINE bosses have warned that the worst is yet to come for the industry after coronavirus fears saw passenger 
demand slump, with carriers cutting flights to locations round the world.
Speaking at an industry conference in Brussels, outgoing IAG boss Willie Walsh said that there had been "a very 
significant fall-off in demand" in Italian markets, while Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said he was expecting a "very 
deflated booking environment" for two or three weeks.
Both however agreed that there would be a "rapid return to normal" if the outbreak stabilises and follows the pattern 
in Asia.
O'Leary was speaking after budget carrier Ryanair revealed year-on-year passenger growth for February, 
increasing 10 per cent from 9.6m to 10.5m passengers.
However, after last night's warning over the cancellation of 25 per cent of its Italian short-haul programme for the 
three weeks from 17 March, it added that traffic and load factor were "likely to be lower than normal due to the fall in 
bookings during that period in response to the virus".
IAG-owned British Airways also warned that it will cut more than 400 flights, including at least one a day to New 
York's JFK airport, in response to outbreak, between 16 and 28 March.
Airlines did at least have a better day on the world's markets, having led the way in the record falls posted over the 
last week. IAG, which fell as low as 420p yesterday, rallied to post a seven per cent rise, making it the FTSE 100's 
best performing stock.
Airline bosses warn the worst is yet to come
Tour operator Tui, which is widely tipped to fall out of London's bluechip index in today's reshuffle, also rose three 
per cent, as did Ryanair, while Easyjet rose 4.5 per cent over the day's trading.

O'Leary is not happy  Credits Getty Images Alt Text Ryanair, Michael O'Leary  Michael O'Leary says social media 
has lost perspective on the outbreak One-Minute Read[1] Wednesday, March 4, 2020 - 5:46am The boss of 
Ryanair has condemned what he called 'lunacy on social media' and 'hysteria' in coverage of the coronavirus. 
Speaking to Sky News[2], Michael O'Leary appealed for a calm and measured approach to the coronavirus[3] 
outbreak and said 'Let's not have irrational panic measures.' As his airline adjusted its flight schedules, he said the 
decision to cancel the Ireland-Italy Six Nations rugby match in Dublin this coming weekend was 'not sensible or 
proportionate'. Earlier this week Ryanair confirmed it was to cut the frequency of services to northern Italy by 25%, 
after it witnessed a passenger no-show rate of up to 50% for Italy flights. 
Ryanair's share price has lost a quarter of its value since the crisis unfolded. Asked whether he felt investors had 
over-reacted, O'Leary said: 'I suspect so'. He said of the outbreak: 'I'm reasonably optimistic it will be reasonably 
short-lived - remember we're coming into the spring-summer period in Europe. That itself will help to limit the 
spread of a flu-like virus.' See related Coronavirus symptoms - and how to self-quarantine[4] Turning to the national 
conversation over the virus[5], he said: 'We would hope to see some of the hysteria taken out of the coverage of the 
Covid-19 virus outbreak that we've seen over the last week, more accurate government... and WHO (World Health 
Organisation) information being communicated and help us to fend off some of the frankly lunacy communicated on 
social media.' Airlines are being hit hard by the saga. IAG, the owner of British Airways, and easyJet have been 
among the carriers cutting capacity in services to and from Italy because of falling demand. The BBC[6] reports that 
British Airways is cancelling 216 flights from London to destinations including New York, Italy, France, Austria, 
Belgium, Germany and Ireland. -------------------------------For a round-up of the most important business stories[7]

Airbus is reviewing its 2020 delivery targets, issued barely three weeks ago, as the global spread of coronavirus in 
recent days through Europe and into the US pushes the aviation industry into crisis mode.
Passenger demand plunged sharply at the weekend, forcing carriers around the world to freeze hiring and slash the 
number of flights, including on lucrative transatlantic routes. Iata, the airline trade body, will tomorrow significantly 
increase its estimate of the hit to global sales as a result of the virus. Just 12 days ago it estimated a near $30bn 
impact, based largely on the reduction in flights to and from China.
Data show a 2.8 per cent fall in global aircraft capacity so far this year, according to aviation data consultancy 
Ascend, against IATA's expectations late last year for growth of 4.7 per cent in 2020.
In that context, Airbus will not be alone in reassessing its guidance. Executives from both the aerospace and airline 
industries said they were monitoring the situation on a daily basis. Airbus has not yet decided to cut its delivery 
target but one person with knowledge of the situation said: "There are several airlines trying to defer deliveries. It is 
probable that guidance will have to be reassessed before the end of March." Airbus declined to comment.
Virus pushes aviation sector into 'crisis zone' Carriers rush to cancel flights and freeze hiring as demand falls 
while jet makers are forced to reassess delive....
Analysts suggested that the impact of deferrals on Boeing could be mitigated by the year-long grounding of the 737 
Max after two fatal crashes.
Some airlines were also seeking a temporary holiday from lease payments, according to two industry insiders.
Moves this week by carriers from British Airways to Ryanair to sharply cut flights show how quickly the crisis is 
escalating for the sector.
"We're in a crisis zone for airlines. The situation has rather dramatically accelerated over this last weekend," said 
Brian Pearce, chief economist at Iata.
"This is far worse than the Sars episode," he added. "It's looking more like the global financial crisis, where airline 
revenues fell 16 per cent in 2009. We're not there yet but it will depend on the success of which governments 
manage to contain this European outbreak."
On Monday BA slashed more than 400 flights between March 16 and March 28, to countries including Italy, 
Germany and, crucially, the US. Its decision to cut transatlantic routes was highly unusual. The last time this 
happened in any sustained way was during the 2008/09 financial crisis, according to Rob Stallard, aerospace 
analyst at Vertical Research.
Ryanair cut short-haul flights to Italy by up to 25 per cent between March 17 and April 8, while Lufthansa and 
easyJet cut capacity late last week.
Sources at Virgin Atlantic said it had seen a 40 per cent drop in customer demand compared with March 2019, in a 
sign that concerns were hitting transatlantic routes, not just short-haul flights in Europe. The airline is likely to 
become the latest carrier to step up emergency cost-saving measures to protect its balance sheet in the coming 
days. Some European airline executives played down concerns that the coronavirus outbreak would cause 
significant and long-term damage to demand.
Michael O'Leary, group chief executive at Ryanair, Europe's biggest lowcost carrier, said: "The immediate short-
term panic about travelling will erode very rapidly. It will erode over the next two or three weeks." He added: "Will 
families continue to travel on their Easter school break? Yes, they will unless there is some unforeseen events."
Willie Walsh, CEO of IAG, which owns BA, said the virus situation was not like the 9/11 terrorist attacks. "9/11 was 
clearly a transatlantic issue. It represented a very significant fall in demand in transatlantic but it did recover pretty 
quickly once US skies reopened."
He too expected the decline to abate soon. "If it follows the pattern that we saw in Asia, you would expect it to 
stabilise within a couple of weeks."
Nevertheless, airlines seemed to be moving into "survival mode", said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at 
Ascend. "The name of the game is to hunker down, reduce cost by paring schedule as far as possible, seek capital 
cost reductions by negotiating with leasing companies, enjoy lower fuel prices that are resulting, and then ensure 
that when the crisis ends ... you are still in business," he said.
In a note yesterday, HSBC aviation analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said on a base case scenario the European listed 
carriers could see earnings cuts ranging from 87 per cent at Air France-KLM to 23 per cent at Wizz Air for 2020.
Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet, said the hit to the sector would depend on how successful countries were at 
containing the virus. "We can see this is stabilising in some markets and then we can see this is a very short term 
effect on bookings," he said. However he warned that if containment failed, the situation would be more 
challenging.
The 2.8 per cent fall in global capacity was "scary", according to Mr Stallard. "We have gone from being up more 
than 4 to minus 2.8 in a matter of weeks."
Virus pushes aviation sector into 'crisis zone' Carriers rush to cancel flights and freeze hiring as demand falls 
while jet makers are forced to reassess delive....
On February 13 Airbus said it expected to deliver around 880 commercial aircraft this year, assuming "no major 
disruptions, including from the coronavirus". Now, however, it is in discussions with airline customers, many of 
whom are Chinese, about possible deferrals of deliveries, according to people with knowledge of the situation. 
Chinese carriers were still bound by travel restrictions and many could not come to collect their aircraft, according to 
one industry executive. "The timing of this is the big question," said one senior aerospace executive. "It is how deep 
will it be and where is the bottom, and then how steep the slope will be on the other side.
"But it is still more wait and see at this point. Conversations with airlines are occurring, but not yet about making 
major changes on a major scale."
Many aerospace executives were still holding to targets set in the early weeks of 2020. The experience of the Sars 
epidemic had shown that demand recovered quickly - within six to seven months - once the worst was over, said 
one. "The next two months are pretty important," he added.
The spread of the virus outside Asia is also hitting the so-called "super connector" carriers, such as Emirates and 
Qatar Airways, whose growth strategies have largely been based on linking cities in the Far East with the Middle 
East, Africa, Europe and the Americas.
Dubai's Emirates yesterday said it had offered staff voluntary unpaid leave as it cut flights to destinations affected 
by the outbreak and sees slower demand in some markets. Employees note that the picture is mixed across 
Emirates' network, with routes into Asia and Europe still showing strong demand. "But it's a quiet period," said one 
pilot. "The test will be the start of Easter holidays."
While airlines globally are freezing recruitment and investment to protect profitability, analysts said many weaker 
players were at risk of collapse. "Airlines have to walk a line between taking action to protect themselves in this 
period and yet be in a position to take advantage of a resumption in demand when it comes," said Mr Lobbenberg.

Airbus is reviewing its 2020 delivery targets, issued barely three weeks ago, as the global spread of coronavirus in 
recent days through Europe and into the US pushes the aviation industry into crisis mode.
Passenger demand plunged sharply at the weekend, forcing carriers around the world to freeze hiring and slash the 
number of flights, including on lucrative transatlantic routes. Iata, the airline trade body, will tomorrow significantly 
increase its estimate of the hit to global sales as a result of the virus. Just 12 days ago it estimated a near $30bn 
impact, based largely on the reduction in flights to and from China.
Data show a 2.8 per cent fall in global aircraft capacity so far this year, according to aviation data consultancy 
Ascend, against IATA's expectations late last year for growth of 4.7 per cent in 2020.
In that context, Airbus will not be alone in reassessing its guidance. Executives from both the aerospace and airline 
industries said they were monitoring the situation on a daily basis. Airbus has not yet decided to cut its delivery 
target but one person with knowledge of the situation said: "There are several airlines trying to defer deliveries. It is 
probable that guidance will have to be reassessed before the end of March." Airbus declined to comment.

while jet makers are forced to reassess delive....
Analysts suggested that the impact of deferrals on Boeing could be mitigated by the year-long grounding of the 737 
Max after two fatal crashes.
Some airlines were also seeking a temporary holiday from lease payments, according to two industry insiders.
Moves this week by carriers from British Airways to Ryanair to sharply cut flights show how quickly the crisis is 
escalating for the sector.
"We're in a crisis zone for airlines. The situation has rather dramatically accelerated over this last weekend," said 
Brian Pearce, chief economist at Iata.
"This is far worse than the Sars episode," he added. "It's looking more like the global financial crisis, where airline 
revenues fell 16 per cent in 2009. We're not there yet but it will depend on the success of which governments 
manage to contain this European outbreak."
On Monday BA slashed more than 400 flights between March 16 and March 28, to countries including Italy, 
Germany and, crucially, the US. Its decision to cut transatlantic routes was highly unusual. The last time this 
happened in any sustained way was during the 2008/09 financial crisis, according to Rob Stallard, aerospace 
analyst at Vertical Research.
Ryanair cut short-haul flights to Italy by up to 25 per cent between March 17 and April 8, while Lufthansa and 
easyJet cut capacity late last week.
Sources at Virgin Atlantic said it had seen a 40 per cent drop in customer demand compared with March 2019, in a 
sign that concerns were hitting transatlantic routes, not just short-haul flights in Europe. The airline is likely to 
become the latest carrier to step up emergency cost-saving measures to protect its balance sheet in the coming 
days. Some European airline executives played down concerns that the coronavirus outbreak would cause 
significant and long-term damage to demand.
Michael O'Leary, group chief executive at Ryanair, Europe's biggest lowcost carrier, said: "The immediate short-
term panic about travelling will erode very rapidly. It will erode over the next two or three weeks." He added: "Will 
families continue to travel on their Easter school break? Yes, they will unless there is some unforeseen events."
Willie Walsh, CEO of IAG, which owns BA, said the virus situation was not like the 9/11 terrorist attacks. "9/11 was 
clearly a transatlantic issue. It represented a very significant fall in demand in transatlantic but it did recover pretty 
quickly once US skies reopened."
He too expected the decline to abate soon. "If it follows the pattern that we saw in Asia, you would expect it to 
stabilise within a couple of weeks."
Nevertheless, airlines seemed to be moving into "survival mode", said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at 
Ascend. "The name of the game is to hunker down, reduce cost by paring schedule as far as possible, seek capital 
cost reductions by negotiating with leasing companies, enjoy lower fuel prices that are resulting, and then ensure 
that when the crisis ends ... you are still in business," he said.
In a note yesterday, HSBC aviation analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said on a base case scenario the European listed 
carriers could see earnings cuts ranging from 87 per cent at Air France-KLM to 23 per cent at Wizz Air for 2020.
Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet, said the hit to the sector would depend on how successful countries were at 
containing the virus. "We can see this is stabilising in some markets and then we can see this is a very short term 
effect on bookings," he said. However he warned that if containment failed, the situation would be more 
challenging.
The 2.8 per cent fall in global capacity was "scary", according to Mr Stallard. "We have gone from being up more 
than 4 to minus 2.8 in a matter of weeks."
Virus pushes aviation sector into 'crisis zone' Carriers rush to cancel flights and freeze hiring as demand falls 
while jet makers are forced to reassess delive....
On February 13 Airbus said it expected to deliver around 880 commercial aircraft this year, assuming "no major 
disruptions, including from the coronavirus". Now, however, it is in discussions with airline customers, many of 
whom are Chinese, about possible deferrals of deliveries, according to people with knowledge of the situation. 
Chinese carriers were still bound by travel restrictions and many could not come to collect their aircraft, according to 
one industry executive. "The timing of this is the big question," said one senior aerospace executive. "It is how deep 
will it be and where is the bottom, and then how steep the slope will be on the other side.
"But it is still more wait and see at this point. Conversations with airlines are occurring, but not yet about making 
major changes on a major scale."
Many aerospace executives were still holding to targets set in the early weeks of 2020. The experience of the Sars 
epidemic had shown that demand recovered quickly - within six to seven months - once the worst was over, said 
one. "The next two months are pretty important," he added.
The spread of the virus outside Asia is also hitting the so-called "super connector" carriers, such as Emirates and 
Qatar Airways, whose growth strategies have largely been based on linking cities in the Far East with the Middle 
East, Africa, Europe and the Americas.
Dubai's Emirates yesterday said it had offered staff voluntary unpaid leave as it cut flights to destinations affected 
by the outbreak and sees slower demand in some markets. Employees note that the picture is mixed across 
Emirates' network, with routes into Asia and Europe still showing strong demand. "But it's a quiet period," said one 
pilot. "The test will be the start of Easter holidays."
While airlines globally are freezing recruitment and investment to protect profitability, analysts said many weaker 
players were at risk of collapse. "Airlines have to walk a line between taking action to protect themselves in this 
period and yet be in a position to take advantage of a resumption in demand when it comes," said Mr Lobbenberg.

Mar 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - March 4, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every 
day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial 
markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], LATAM Airlines LTM[2], United 
Airlines UAL[3], Delta Air Lines DAL[4] and American Airlines AAL[5].Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst 
Blog: IATA Request Spells Further Challenges for Coronavirus-Hit AirlinesThe rapid spread of the dreaded 
coronavirus (COVID-19) rattled the airline industry significantly by crippling air-travel demand. This is evident from 
the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) last-monthprojection[6], which suggested that airline revenues 
for 2020 might be hurt in excess of $29 billion due to this adversity. 
Per this research firm's latest commentary, it requested an immediate suspension of rules governing the usage of 
airport slots. This statement further adds to the gloomy scenario.Alarmingly, the coronavirus outbreak is now no 
longer restricted to its country of origin, China. The health scare spread it tentacles fast to every continent barring 
Antarctica ever since it was first detected late last year. The contagious disease already registered a death toll of 
above 3,000 people apart from infecting more than 88,000, globally.As a result of this health peril, the 
ZacksAirline[7]industry has declined 21.9% in the past month as it grapples with dwindling demand for international 
travel. The S...00 Index has also shed 10.3% of value in the same time frame.Against this backdrop, the IATA's 
request to aviation regulators worldwide for suspension of slot-use rulesfor the entire season (through Oct 2020) is 
fully understandable.Delving DeeperCurrently, around 43% passengers depart from more than 200 slot-coordinated 
airports, globally. Per the existing rules for slot allocation, the concerned carrier under normal circumstances needs 
to operate at least 80% of the slots allocated to it. In the event of non-compliance, the airline has to give up its right 
to the slot in the next equivalent season. The concerned regulator can relax the above rule under special 
circumstances.Why the Request?Various airlines across the globe are trimming their capacity as the coronavirus 
outbreak is speedily becoming a full-blown pandemic from an epidemic. Reportedly, the European low-cost carrier 
Ryanair Holdings decided to reduce flights to/from Italy by 25% for three weeks. The decision to cut capacity in its 
largest market followed a significant decline in bookings due to this health hazard.According to a Reuters report, 
Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines also planned to cancel its daily flight from Sao Paulo to the Italian

destination, Milan, through Apr 16 due to coronavirus-induced tepid demand. LATAM's U.S. counterparts, namely 
United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also decided to slash flight frequency in a bid to combat the 
sharp drop in air traffic.For instance, Delta and American Airlines recently chose to suspend some flights 
connecting the United States with Milan. Moreover, United Airlines cut back flights to Japan, South Korea and 
Singapore due to substantially weak demand on these routes. Additionally, this Chicago-based airline, which carries 
a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is offering travel waivers to Italy. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. Going by IATA, many carriers are 'reporting 50% no-shows across several 
markets.'With airlines across the world swinging into action to tackle this tepid demand caused by the health threat 
as highlighted by the above evidences, the current scenario certainly qualifies as an exceptional circumstance. 
Therefore, it is widely perceived that the existing slot-allocation rule that requires the concerned carrier to operate 
minimum 80% of its allocated slots should be made flexible. This, in turn, will allow airlines to adjust their schedules 
to suit the current situation of low air-traffic.Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech

Mar 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
companies like the U.S.-based American Airlines AAL[1], the European carrier Ryanair RYAAY[2] and the Latin 
American LATAM Airlines LTM[3] suspended various flights as the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) spread it 
tentacles beyond its country of origin, China. In fact, this contagious disease now left an impact on every continent 
barring Antarctica, claiming multiple lives and infecting in larger numbers.In another coronavirus-related update, 
United Airlines UAL[4] postponed its investor day. Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines SAVE[5] grabbed headlines as it came 
out with an expansion-related update. Moreover, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Delta 
Air Lines DAL[6].(Read the Last Airline Stock Rounduphere[7]).Flashback to Past Week's Top Stories1. American 
Airlines, which already cancelled flights connecting the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) with China 
and Hong Kong, now suspended flights between DFW and South Korea's Incheon International Airport due to 
lackluster demand following the coronavirus outbreak. 
Flights on the Dallas-Seoul route are expected to commence on Apr 25, 2020. The carrier also decided to suspend 
all U.S. flights to Milan, Italy, again due to this soft air-travel demand induced by the coronavirus. (Read more: 
American Airlines to Cancel Milan Flights on Coronavirus Woes[8]).American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here[9].2. United Airlines 
deferred its investor day, scheduled to be held on Mar 5, to September due to the plaguing coronavirus scare. 
Management feels that given the current situation it will not be feasible to have a productive conversation revolving 
around its long-term strategy. Simultaneously, the carrier cut back flights to Japan, South Korea and Singapore, 
significantly due to low demand on these routes. The airline reduced approximately two thirds of its flights to Seoul, 
a third of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. (Read more: United Airlines Calls Off Investor Day on 
Coronavirus Threat[10]).3. Per a Reuters report, LATAM Airlines announced the cancellation of its daily flight 
connecting Sao Paulo and Milan through Apr16 due to tepid demand post the coronavirus outbreak. Citing the 
same reason, Ryanair plans to lower its flight frequency to and from Italy by 25%. Capacity in the airline's primary 
market, Italy, will be slashed for the Mar 17-Apr 8 period. However, Ryanair's flight cancellations will not leave as 
much an impact as anticipated on its current financial year ending Mar 31.(Read more: Ryanair to Cut Back Flights 
to Italy Amid Coronavirus Fears[11]).4 In a bid to expand its international footprint, Spirit Airlines announced that it 
will include more flights from the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport to two international

destinations, namely, Cancun, Mexico and San Pedro Sula, Honduras. While flights connecting New Orleans with 
Cancun will be operational from Jun 10, 2020 onward, services on the New Orleans-Honduras route will start the 
following day. (Read more: Spirit Boosts Global Network, Adds Flights From New Orleans[12]).5. Taking advantage 
of the sharp depreciation in stock price as the coronavirus persistently wreaks havoc, Warren Buffett, considered 
one of the greatest (if not the greatest) investors of all times, raised his stake in Delta. Per a Bloomberg report, this 
Berkshire Hathaway founder and CEO purchased more than 976,000 shares of the airline behemoth for $45.3 
million.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and 
during the past six months.The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the red over the past 
week inducing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to decline 6.9% to $80.73. Over the course of six months, the sector 
tracker has inched up 0.6%.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will await the fourth-quarter 2019 earnings

Mar 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive February traffic figures as air-travel demand was solid in the month. Traffic (including 
0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit in Austria) rose 9% year over year to 10.5 million.However, load factor (% of 
seats filled with passengers) remained unaltered at 96%. This low-cost carrier's passenger growth excluding traffic 
from LaudaMotion unit was 8% in the month. On a rolling annual basis, total traffic increased 9% to 153.8 million. 
This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Irish carrier operated more than 58,000 scheduled flights in February.You can

price[4] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[5]Coronavirus Woes May Weigh on Traffic Ahead However, the carrier might 
not be able to replicate February's stellar traffic results, at least in the near term. 
Notably, Ryanair will cut 25% of its Italian capacity in the Mar 17-Apr 8 time frame following reduced air-travel 
demand due to the rapid spread of the disease across many European countries.As a result of this anticipated 
decline in bookings, traffic and load factor are likely be 'lower than normal' in March and April. In fact, Ryanair's 
CEO Michael O'Leary warned of a "meaningful impact" of the virus on fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ending Mar 31, 
2020) results.Notably, Ryanair is not the only carrier to have trimmed its capacity due to the viral outbreak. U.S.-
based carriers including American Airlines AAL[6], United Airlines UAL[7] and the Latin American carrier LATAM 
Airlines LTM[8] also suspended various flights in the wake of the coronavirus onslaught beyond its country of origin,

 Airlines have been among the industries hardest hit by the global spread of the coronavirus but some air carrier 
chief executives are reportedly predicting that consumer demand for flights may stabilize in the coming weeks.
Early on Tuesday, Wizz Air (WIZZ.L), the largest low-cost airline in Central and Eastern Europe, said in a trading 
update that the spread of COVID-19 -- a deadly pneumonia-like virus that is infectious even in incubation -- had 
prompted "capacity reduction" while noting "slightly" lower load factors in February.
The load factor, a measure of capacity utilization, fell to 93.8% last month from 94.2% a year ago. This follows a 
surge of more than 26% in the number of seats and an increase of almost 26% in the number of booked 
passengers from February 2019.
Last Friday, WIZZ said about 60% of its total capacity in Italy, the epicenter of the coronavirus in Europe, had been 
cut because of a "decreasing trend in demand." Significant cancellations were announced on specific routes to 
northern Italy, which is where the virus is concentrated in the country, between March 11 and April 2.
Reuters news agency reported on Tuesday that Emirates has asked staff to take unpaid leave for up to a month at 
a time due to the rapid spread of coronavirus. Chief Operating Officer Adel al-Redha was cited by the news agency 
as saying the airline has more resources than it needs following flight cancellations to destinations such as Iran, 
Bahrain, and most of China.
Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L), the biggest European budget airline, said it was reducing its short-haul flight program -- 
mainly to and from Italy -- by up to 25% for a three-week period from Mar 17 to Wed April 8, in response to the 
spread of the coronavirus.
Over the past week, Ryanair has seen a significant drop in bookings over that late March/early April period. "There 
has also been a significant step up in passenger no-shows on flights, particularly from and within Italy," the carrier 
said in a statement on Monday.
Airlines Hit by Coronavirus Health Emergency, But Some Executives See Demand Stabilizing in 'Coming 
Weeks'
Germany's TUI (TUI.L, TUI1.DE), the world's largest listed tour operator, also said late on Monday that it had 
experienced "weaker bookings in the last week, especially for our remaining, near-term and lower volume winter 
season."
While noting that year-to-date bookings remained well above the prior-year because of "strong" trading prior to last 
week, the company said that it currently foresees a "marginal effect on our operations, for example, due to 
necessary re-routing of Mein Schiff 6 in Asia."
Meanwhile, bosses at Ryanair and British Airways owner IAG (IAG.L), which has also cut services to mainland 
China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Italy in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, reportedly expect the drop-
off in travel demand to stabilize in the coming weeks.
Reuters said that IAG CEO Willie Walsh expects European demand to "stabilize in the coming weeks if the pattern 
in Europe is similar to that in Asia."
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary, who is among the heads of Europe's biggest airlines gathered in 
Brussels, Belgium amid the global coronavirus outbreak, is reported to have said that if the coronavirus "settles 
down over Easter then people will rapidly begin to focus on summer travel."
More than 3,100 people have reportedly died because of the coronavirus, with confirmed infections surpassing 
90,000 globally. South Korea, Italy, and Iran are among the worst affected countries outside China, which remains 
the global epicenter of the virus.

Airlines face worsening coronavirus impact
Airlines face worsening coronavirus impact

The worst is still to come for the airline industry in terms of economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak, 
European carrier bosses warned on Tuesday, but they predicted that travel demand could stabilise in the coming 
weeks.
Coronavirus dominated the conversation as the heads of Europe's biggest carriers including Ryanair's Michael 
O'Leary and Willie Walsh, boss of British Airways-owner IAG, gathered at an annual industry conference, to lobby 
against new air taxes and call for improvements to air traffic control.
Airlines worldwide have been suspending flights or modifying services in response to the coronavirus outbreak, 
which has now claimed more than 3,000 lives and infected more than 90,000 people globally, after spreading from 
China to 77 other countries and territories.
Walsh noted a "very significant fall-off in demand" in Italian markets in the past week, as Italy has seen the biggest 
outbreak in Europe. But he predicted demand would stabilise in coming weeks if bookings followed the pattern seen 
in Asia.
"I think we will see air traffic recover in due course," he said.
Ryanair's O'Leary agreed that the next few weeks would be tough. He said he expected a "very deflated booking 
environment" for the next two to three weeks, but should the crisis stabilise, bookings would recover.
"I think you will see a pretty rapid return to normal," he said.
Airlines face worsening coronavirus impact
As part of the European airline lobby group A4E, the airlines - which also include Lufthansa, Air France-KLM 
easyJet - called for a relaxation of airport regulations to help them cope with the impact of coronavirus.
That followed a call from global industry body IATA on Monday for a suspension of rules under which airlines can 
lose lucrative landing and take-off slots if they cancel flights for a prolonged period.
"We request that a temporary waiver be granted by all (EU) member states,” Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith said 
ahead of the annual conference of the Brussels-based lobbying group.
Airlines also want a "common set of health requirements for travel to and from the affected regions", he said.
But IAG's Walsh said that struggling airlines should not be given state aid to enable them to survive the drop-off in 
demand.
"I don't believe it's appropriate for governments to provide state aid to airlines that were not sustainable before the 
coronavirus," he said.
The crisis, which has led to a quarter of the short-haul fleet of airlines like Lufthansa being grounded, comes on top 
of a list of pressures on the European airline industry.
Executives at the Brussels gathering listed other grievances including the failure to reform air traffic control 
networks under the delayed EU Single European Sky initiative.
"It is a scandal that we are still flying the skies today in the same way we were 40 years ago," Walsh said.
Taxes on flying were also opposed, with O'Leary attacking plans by Austria's new coalition government of 
conservatives and Greens to increase a tax on flights next year.
The Ryanair boss called the new taxes "the equivalent of latter-day highwaymen". (Reuters)

British Airways and Ryanair cancelled hundreds of flights yesterday as the airlines industry body warned that the 
coronavirus outbreak had caused a collapse in passenger numbers.
BA announced that it would cancel more than 200 flights to countries including Italy, Germany and the US, "to 
match reduced demand due to the continuing coronavirus issue".
Ryanair said it was cutting flights to Italy by up to 25 per cent, mostly on routes to the north of the country.
The cancellations follow similar moves by Lufthansa and easyJet. The schedule changes amplified a warning from 
the International Air Transport Association, which said that coronavirus had resulted in "serious declines in 
demand", with airlines responding by imposing unpaid leave, freezing pay and grounding aircraft.
One airline reported that bookings for flights to Italy had dropped to zero while refunds were growing; another cited 
a 26 per cent reduction across its entire market compared to last year.
Some told Iata that 50 per cent of passengers were not showing up to fly on some routes.
Given the "extraordinary circumstances" of the outbreak, Iata called on regulators to suspend rules that mean 
carriers lose airport landing and takeoff slots if they do not use them for 80 per cent of the time. Widespread 
cancellations mean airlines would be forced to run empty services to keep their allocations, the body said.
Airline body warns of deepening virus crisis as passenger numbers collapse
Alexandre de Juniac, Iata directorgeneral, said: "It's essential that the regulatory community work with us to ensure 
airlines are able to operate in the most sustainable manner, to alleviate the worst impacts of the crisis."
Airports Coordination Limited, which oversees slot allocation for the UK, said it would relax the rules on flights to 
and from mainland China and Hong Kong.
Some airlines have warned that the sharp drop in demand is likely to hit earnings. Ryanair said it did not expect 
cancellations to have a material impact in the current year.

 Ryanair noted that traffic and load factor in the months of March and April is likely to be lower than normal due to 
lower bookings due to Covid-19 virus outbreak in a number of European countries. Ryanair has cancelled up to 
25% of its Italian short haul program for the 3-week period from 17th March to 8th April.

TWO OF the UK's leading airlines will cut flights from their London hubs after coronavirus fears have led to a 
demand slump, while European holiday firm Tui will slash its budget.
British Airways will cancel more than 400 flights, while budget carrier Ryanair is cutting 25 per cent of its capacity to 
and from Italy.
BA's affected flights are between 16 and 28 March, mainly from Heathrow to cities in Europe. Around 26 BA 
Cityflyer flights between London City and Germany and Italy in the same period are also canned.
Tui said it will make cuts to its administrative budget, freeze hiring and postpone non-critical projects, following 
weaker bookings last week.

Mar 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[2] plans to reduce flights to and from Italy by 25% following a significant drop in bookings in 
the region due to the coronavirus outbreak. Capacity in the airline's primary market, Italy, will be slashed for the 
period between Mar 17 and Apr 8. This European low-cost carrier witnessed a dramatic fall in ticket purchases over 
the past week and a "significant step up" passenger no-shows, especially from and within Italy.However, Ryanair 
does not expect its flight cancellations to have as much of an impact on its current financial year ending Mar 31. As 
far as the virus' impact on its next year 's results is concerned, the carrier feels that it is "far too early to 
speculate".Ryanair Holdings PLC Price            https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-

IATA Request Spells Further Doom for Coronavirus -Hit Airlines

Mar 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The rapid spread of the 
dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) rattled the airline industry significantly by crippling air-travel demand. This is 
evident from the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) last-month projection[1], which suggested that 
airline revenues for 2020 might be hurt in excess of $29 billion due to this adversity. Per this research firm's latest 
commentary, it requested an immediate suspension of rules governing the usage of airport slots. This statement 
further adds to the gloomy scenario.Alarmingly, the coronavirus outbreak is now no longer restricted to its country of 
origin, China. 
The health scare spread it tentacles fast to every continent barring Antarctica ever since it was first detected late 
last year. The contagious disease already registered a death toll of above 3,000 people apart from infecting more 
than 88,000, globally.As a result of this health peril, the ZacksAirline[2]industry has declined 21.9% in the past 
month as it grapples with dwindling demand for international travel. The S...00 Index has also shed 10.3% of value 
in the same time frame.Against this backdrop, the IATA's request to aviation regulators worldwide for suspension of 
slot-use rulesfor the entire season (through Oct 2020) is fully understandable.Delving DeeperCurrently, around 43% 
passengers depart from more than 200 slot-coordinated airports, globally. Per the existing rules for slot allocation, 
the concerned carrier under normal circumstances needs to operate at least 80% of the slots allocated to it. In the 
event of non-compliance, the airline has to give up its right to the slot in the next equivalent season. The concerned 
regulator can relax the above rule under special circumstances.Why the Request?Various airlines across the globe 
are trimming their capacity as the coronavirus outbreak is speedily becoming a full-blown pandemic from an 
epidemic. Reportedly, the European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] decided to reduce flights to/from 
Italy by 25% for three weeks. The decision to cut capacity in its largest market followed a significant decline in 
bookings due to this health hazard.According to a Reuters report, Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines LTM[4] 
also planned to cancel its daily flight from Sao Paulo to the Italian destination, Milan, through Apr 16 due to 
coronavirus-induced tepid demand. LATAM's U.S. counterparts, namely United Airlines UAL[5], Delta Air Lines 
DAL[6] and American Airlines AAL[7] also decided to slash flight frequency in a bid to combat the sharp drop in air 
traffic.For instance, Delta and American Airlines recently chose to suspend some flights connecting the United 
States with Milan. Moreover, United Airlines cut back flights to Japan, South Korea and Singapore due to 
substantially weak demand on these routes. Additionally, this Chicago-based airline, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold), is offering travel waivers to Italy. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
IATA Request Spells Further Doom for Coronavirus -Hit Airlines
here[8]. JetBlue Airways JBLU[9] also announced a waiver in its change and cancel fees for all new flight bookings. 
Going by IATA, many carriers are 'reporting 50% no-shows across several markets'.With airlines across the world 
swinging into action to tackle this tepid demand caused by the health threat as highlighted by the above evidences, 
the current scenario certainly qualifies as an exceptional circumstance. Therefore, it is widely perceived that the 
existing slot-allocation rule that requires the concerned carrier to operate minimum 80% of its allocated slots should 
be made flexible. This, in turn, will allow airlines to adjust their schedules to suit the current situation of low air-
traffic.Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 
billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They're also finding ways to edit the 
human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases.Zacks has just released Century of Biology: 7 
Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance. Our recent

EU executive probes France's Beziers airport over competition rules

The European Commission opened an investigation on Monday into France's regional Beziers airport on suspicion 
that its operators had breached EU competition rules.
Beziers airport, in the southern French region of Occitane, served more than 250,000 passengers last year, 
according to the commission.
The airport operations changed hands in 2011 from the local chamber of commerce to a syndicate composed of 
local and regional public authorities.
The commission - which acts as the European Union's competition watchdog - received a complaint about public 
funds granted to the successive operators from 2007 until now, as well as deals they struck with Ryanair.
The operational aid may have granted Beziers airport an unfair competitive benefit, while the agreements with 
Ryanair may have given it "an undue economic advantage vis-a-vis its competitors that might amount to 
incompatible aid," the commission wrote.
The EU executive has investigated several funding arrangements aimed at keeping airlines operating at certain 
regional airports, cracking down in recent years on schemes in France, Germany, Austria and Italy.
In 2018, meanwhile, French authorities impounded a Ryanair plane to recoup state aid to the airline that Brussels 
had found to be illegal.

Mar 02, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  British Airways 
and Ireland's Ryanair on Monday announced major flight cancellations particularly to Italy, in response to the 
worsening novel coronavirus outbreak, while Germany's Lufthansa extended cutbacks.BA, which is owned by 
International Airlines Group, said it would cancel some 216 flights to various countries as a result of weaker 
demand sapped by the spread of COVID-19 disease.The International Civil Aviation Organization says the virus 
outbreak -- which has hit Italy the hardest in Europe -- could mean a $4.0-5.0 billion drop in worldwide airline 
revenue."To match reduced demand due to the continuing coronavirus issue, we are merging a number of flights 
between March 16 and March 28," BA said in a statement."We will be contacting customers on cancelled flights so 
we can discuss their travel options, including rebooking onto other carriers where possible, full refunds or booking 
with BA for a later date of travel." The cancelled flights include 12 from London Heathrow to New York's JFK airport, 
plus 204 short-haul round-trips, including to Albania, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, France, Germany and 
Switzerland.There was no word from parent group IAG about its other divisions which include Spain's Iberia and 
Ireland's Aer Lingus. In a further development, Brazilian carrier Latam suspended flights between San Paolo and 
Milan from March 2 to April 16.Separately, Irish no-frills airline Ryanair announced it would cut up to a quarter of its 
short-haul flights, particularly to Italy."Ryanair today notified passengers that it was reducing its short haul flight 
program mainly to and from Italy by up to 25 percent for a three-week period from March 17," it said."Over the past 
week, Ryanair has seen a significant drop in bookings over that late March/early April period, in response to the 
COVID-19 virus.""There has also been a significant step up in passenger no-shows on flights, particularly from and 
within Italy," it added. 
British Airways says it is to cancel more than 200 flights due to the coronavirus outbreak, with many others following 
suit in an effort to limit losses Photo: AFP / Justin TALLIS Dublin-based Ryanair did not expect the cancellations to 
have a material impact on its current financial year to March 2020 but said it was "far too early to speculate" what 
the impact might be on 2021."Our focus at this time is on minimising any risk to our people and our passengers," 
noted Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary."It makes sense to selectively prune our schedule to and from those 
airports where travel has been most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak."Earlier Monday, Lufthansa extended 
cancellations on Iran and China routes until late April due to the spreading disease.The group's namesake carrier 
and subsidiaries Austrian and Swiss will not fly to and from mainland China until April 24, Lufthansa said in a 
statement. Tehran flights will be suspended until April 30.The cuts are part of a wider scheme Lufthansa announced 
Friday that will ground 23 long-haul aircraft and cut short- and medium-haul services by up to 25 percent.Lufthansa 
said Monday it was reducing the frequency of flights between major German hubs Frankfurt and Munich and Seoul 
Top Airlines Axe Flights As Coronavirus Saps Demand
and Hong Kong.The group is also reducing frequency on routes to cities in Italy, including Rome, Venice, and Milan, 
with subsidiary Brussels Airlines affected alongside low-cost carrier Eurowings, Austrian and Swiss.It has also 
suspended new hires as part of its measures to cushion the business impact of the virus, which it added was "not 
yet possible to estimate".Ryanair predicted Monday that the outbreak would spark more European airline collapses 
in a sector already marked by fierce competition."We expect that this COVID-19 virus will result in further EU airline 
failures over the coming weeks," Ryanair said while reassuring over the strength of its own balance sheet.In 
northern Italy, 11 towns have been placed under quarantine due to coronavirus.On Monday the global death toll 
from the epidemic passed 3,000 as dozens more patients succumbed in China.More than 90,000 people have now 
been infected around the world, mostly in China but with significant outbreaks also in South Korea, Italy and Iran.

Against the steady rise of infections, European businesses and governments on Monday sought ways to control the 
spread of the coronavirus.
The risk level for people in the European Union due to the spreading coronavirus has been raised from low-to-
moderate to moderate-to-high in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's latest assessment, 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Brussels.
The European Commission launched a coronavirus response team on Monday, scrutinizing medical risks as well as 
the implications for transport and mobility in the European Union, and the bloc's economy.
"While we should not give in to panic, the situation is likely to still get worse," EU Crisis Management Commissioner 
Janez Lenarcic said at a Brussels press conference.
Meanwhile the EU Council Presidency said it fully triggered the bloc's crisis response mechanism, the Integrated 
Political Crisis Response (IPCR), intended to enable quick and coordinated political decisions in severe and 
complex crises.
The European Central Bank said it was standing "ready to take appropriate and targeted measures" as the 
outbreak created "risks for the economic outlook and the functioning of financial markets."
Early on Monday, 2,100 cases had been confirmed in the 18 EU member states, with 38 deaths, EU Health 
Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said.
Virus figures keep ticking up as Europe seeks ways to control spread
Eighteen EU states have launched a joint procurement process to buy protective equipment, she added.
No EU country has so far indicated plans to introduce border checks within the Schengen free movement area.
EU finance ministers are to discuss the situation in a teleconference, Eurogroup president Mario Centeno said on 
Monday, to review recent developments and coordinate national responses.
Nevertheless, some businesses took things into their own hands, with airlines including British Airways, Ryanair 
and Lufthansa cancelling or scaling back flights to European countries which are experiencing larger outbreaks of 
the virus.
The number of cases in Europe also continued to tick up. Portugal became the latest country to report its first case.
In Germany, cases rose to 150, the official disease control institute reported on Monday.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates the risk of the epidemic to be "moderate." Its head, Lothar Wieler, noted the 
situation continued to be extremely dynamic.
In the southern states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria, pupils were ordered to stay home from school after last 
week's Carnival holiday if they had been in a high-risk area.
Several public events have been cancelled, most recently Munich's international craft trades fair (IHM). The federal 
government said it did not believe the epidemic would end soon.
In France, the Paris book fair was cancelled due to government restrictions on indoor events involving more than 
5,000 people.
In Italy, the first coronavirus case linked to the current outbreak was reported in Rome, affecting a policeman who 
came into contact with someone from Lombardy.
Italy now has 2,036 infections, a 20-per-cent increase compared to the previous day, the Italian Civil Protection 
Agency said. The new figure includes 52 dead and 149 recoveries - up from 34 and 83 on Sunday - and 908 
patients in hospital, with 166 in intensive care.
The outbreak remains concentrated in northern Italy, with 1,077 cases in Lombardy, 324 in Emilia-Romagna, 271 in 
Veneto, 51 in Piedmont and 34 in the Marche.
In Europe's Nordic region, the number of reported coronavirus cases increased with four in Denmark, seven in 
Finland, three in Iceland, 25 in Norway and 15 in Sweden on Monday evening.
The king and queen of Sweden postponed an official dinner this week due to the cases, the palace said on 
Monday.
The Swedish Foreign Ministry advised against all travel to Iran, also on Monday.
And after a government meeting addressing the outbreak, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven cancelled a visit to 
South Africa.
France has now confirmed 191 cases of coronavirus infection, up 61 from Sunday, national health director Jerome 
Salomon said.
In Austria, Viennese authorities set up a quarantine area for tourists infected with the virus, but with milder 
symptoms than would require a hospital stay, although no one yet fulfils this criterion.
In Poland, where no cases have been confirmed, a special parliamentary session was convened so lawmakers 
could discuss measures to allow firms to order their employees to work remotely, and exempt from rules of public 
tender the purchase of medical equipment.
Virus figures keep ticking up as Europe seeks ways to control spread
The bill would also broaden the prerogatives of the country's Chief Sanitary Inspectorate in case of an epidemic.
As the virus spreads, the United Nations health chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to take 
decisive action.
Of the 88,900 cases worldwide, 90 per cent were reported from China, most in Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, 
Tedros said.
Outside China, 8,700 cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and four countries 
account for 81 per cent of this figure, he said, naming South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan. "This is not a one-way 
street. We can push this virus back," Tedros said.

Against the steady rise of infections, European businesses and governments on Monday sought ways to control the

Nevertheless, some businesses took things into their own hands.
British Airways cancelled hundreds of flights to Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Ireland and Switzerland, between 
March 17 to 28, citing the outbreak.
Ryanair also scaled back flights to Italy between March 17 and April 8.
Lufthansa and its subsidiaries likewise reduced flights to Italian and Asian destinations, the Frankfurt-based airline 
said on Monday.
Lufthansa and its subsidiaries, Swiss and Austrian Airlines, have already cancelled all flights to and from Chinese 
mainland destinations. The new move is a reaction to the spread of the virus and affects flights scheduled for March 
and April to Italy, Hong Kong and South Korea.
Flights to mainland China have been cancelled until April 24 and to Tehran until April 30.

Ryanair Cuts Italy Flights by up to 25% Over Three-Week Period Because of 
Slump in Bookings

 Ryanair (RYAAY), the biggest European budget airline, said it was reducing its short-haul flight program -- mainly 
to and from Italy -- by up to 25% for a three-week period from Mar 17 to Wed April 8, in response to the spread of 
the coronavirus. 
Over the past week, Ryanair has seen a significant drop in bookings over that late March/early April period, in 
response to the COVID-19, the formal name of the virus.
"There has also been a significant step up in passenger no-shows on flights, particularly from and within Italy," the 
carrier said in a statement.
The airline said it did not expect the cancellations to have a "material impact" on the current year ending March 
2020 guidance, but it was "far too early to speculate what impact the Covid-19 outbreak will have on FY21 
earnings."

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/british-airways-ryanair-cancel-hundreds-of-flights-due-to-coronavirus-
outbreak/British Airways and Ryanair have cancelled hundreds of flights between the UK and parts of Europe and 
the US due to the coronavirus outbreak.The BA cancellations include journeys between Heathrow and Italy, France, 
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland - plus New York's JFK. 
The airline has also cancelled flights between Gatwick and Italy, France and Albania - and London City flights to 
and from Italy and Germany - after another spike in COVID-19 cases in the UK. BA said the changes to its 
timetable as a result of the coronavirus outbreak would see 'a number of flights merged between 16 March and 28 
March'. A spokesman for the airline said: 'We will be contacting customers on cancelled flights so we can discuss 
their travel options, including re-booking on to other carriers where possible, full refunds or booking with BA for a 
later date of travel. 'Customers can also find the latest information and options on BA.com[1].' Ryanair is reducing 
frequencies on some routes by up to 25%, particularly affecting flights to and from Italy. The Dublin-based carrier 
said it would operate a reduced schedule between 17 March and 8 April because of a 'significant drop in bookings' 
over the period caused by concern over COVID-19. Other measures being introduced by Ryanair include 'rolling 
schedule cuts' allocating leave or paid leave to pilots and cabin crew, working with suppliers to cut costs, and 
freezing recruitment, promotion and pay. BA said it is cancelling 12 round-trips from Heathrow to JFK from 17 
March to 28 March. It is also scrapping 171 short-haul roundtrip flights from Heathrow to countries including Italy, 
France, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland over the same dates. The cancellations affect seven short-
haul BA roundtrip flights from Gatwick to Italy, France and Albania from 16 March to 25 March. And BA is cancelling 
26 short-haul roundtrip flights from London City Airport to Germany and Italy from 17 March to 28 March. More than 
89,000 confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 have been recorded globally and there have been more than 
3,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the outbreak. Read more: British Airways

European airline stocks surge on stimulus
European airline stocks surge on stimulus

European airline share prices have surged by double digits amid a strong recovery in global stock markets.   Wizz 
Air's stock price on the London stock exchange rose 13% in early morning trading on 24 March.    Shares in Easyjet 
were up approximately 22%, while IAG and Ryanair stock were both up by 15% over 24 hours.
Lufthansa's share price on the Frankfurt stock exchange rose 11% over the same period. Air France-KLM's stock 
price on France's Euronext stock exchange was up by around 15% over 24 hours.
Markets appear to have been boosted by progress in the roll-out of government stimulus packages, including $1.8 
trillion of support for business that is being negotiated in the USA. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.4% 
on 24 March, its biggest daily gain since 1934, while London's FTSE 100 rose more than 9%.   While airline stocks 
received a boost, they remain heavily depressed compared with their position before coronavirus (Covid-19) began 
its global spread.    Air France-KLM stock is 33% lower than it was a month ago and IAG's price is 55% down from 
where it stood on 25 February.
Asked by Airfinance Journal if airlines were riding a wave of wider macro-economic optimism over US stimulus or 
whether the share price rise was proof of returning confidence in the sector, Neil Glynn, transport analyst at Credit 
Suisse, says: "The former in reality - albeit perhaps confidence also rising on the effectiveness of containment 
measures."   Glynn adds that a sustained recovery in stock prices will be "very confidence dependent".
Peter Morris, chief economist with Cirium, suggests the uptick may be driven by a number of factors.
Longer-term investors such as pension funds may realise that the airline industry "can only improve from here and 
that it has an underlying level of demand that will not disappear in three months downturn".
Share values have fallen so far that they represent a potential "capital appreciation opportunity" to some. There is 
also the potential for government support to avoid bankruptcies and protect share value.
"However, I think that the sentiment is going to be strongest towards the big European players, including Easyjet 
and Ryanair, whose business models are seen as the most robust," he says.

Europe's two largest low-cost carriers, Ryanair and Easyjet, will ground most to all of their aircraft over the coming 
months.
The Ryanair group fleet comprises more than 470 narrowbody aircraft, mostly Boeing 737NGs, while Easyjet has 
318 Airbus A320-family aircraft.
Flight restrictions imposed by countries across Europe mean that Ryanair will ground the "majority" of its aircraft 
over the next week, while "a full grounding of the fleet cannot be ruled out". For now, the airline expects to cut its 
April and May capacity by 80%.
Easyjet, meanwhile, has imposed "significant cancellations", which will "continue on a rolling basis for the 
foreseeable future and could result in the grounding of the majority of the Easyjet fleet", it stated.
Both airlines will continue rescue and repatriation flights.
To mitigate the huge revenue shock, Ryanair is deferring all capital expenditure and share buybacks; freezing 
recruitment and discretionary spending; implementing a series of voluntary leave options; temporarily suspending 
employment contracts; and imposing and significant reductions to working hours and payments.
"Ryanair is a resilient airline group, with a very strong balance sheet, and substantial cash liquidity, and we can, 
and will, with appropriate and timely action, survive through a prolonged period of reduced or even zero flight 
schedules, so that we are adequately prepared for the return to normality," the airline stated.
Easyjet has highlighted its "strong balance sheet", which includes £1.6 billion ($1.9 billion) of cash, an undrawn 
$500 million revolving credit facility, unencumbered aircraft worth more than £4 billion and a large slot portfolio.
The UK carrier has no debt re-financings due until 2022 and has said it is in ongoing discussions with liquidity 
providers. "European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that coordinated government backing will be 
required to ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over," said Easyjet 
chief executive Johan Lundgren.

US lessor GECAS has placed another Airbus A320 with Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion.
This latest delivery marks the third GECAS unit to be placed with the Vienna-based carrier over the past four 
weeks.
Laudamotion's newest fleet addition is a 2008-vintage CFM56-5B4/3-powered unit that recently came off its first 
lease with India's Go Air.
In February, GECAS transitioned two former Philippine Airlines A320s to Laudamotion.
Laudamotion remains committed to growth in 2020, COVID-19 or not.
On 5 March, Airfinance Journal reported that the LCC had signed operating lease deals for five additional A320s 
with Aercap, Castlelake, DAE Capital and Orix Aviation.
Of the five new aircraft to be added in March, a 2008-vintage unit will be supplied by Aercap; two former Airasia-
operated A320s - built in 2005 and 2006 - will come from Castlelake; a 2006-manufactured unit is from DAE 
Capital; and a 2011-vintage A320 formerly flying for India's Indigo will be supplied by Orix Aviation.
DAE Capital and Orix are new lessors to Laudamotion.
Laudamotion's 26 A320s in its current fleet come from 12 leasing companies.
In 2019, Laudamotion announced plans to purchase up to 100 Airbus A321neos for future expansion but no such 
order has been confirmed since. Recently speaking at A4E, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said that order 
hinged on better pricing from Airbus.

Fitch Ratings has downgraded its outlook for Ryanair and Wizz to negative from stable.
The agency based the new outlook on the assumption of a "major halt" to operations due to the coronavirus (Covid-
19) pandemic having a "substantial negative impact" on the credit metrics of the two airlines for the period to March 
2021.
It further reflects a "substantially worsened operating environment" for European airlines generally. In Ryanair's 
case, Fitch noted its large exposure to European countries that are considerably affected by the virus, namely Italy 
and Spain.
The agency reaffirmed its long-term issuer default rating for Ryanair at BBB+, while affirming Wizz's at BBB.
The strong liquidity positions of both airlines should provide sufficient buffer for lost revenues in full year 2021, but a 
delay in recovery beyond the second half of 2020 or a failure to implement mitigation measures could lead to further 
downgrades.
Fitch estimated that Ryanair's cash position of more than (EURO)4 billion ($4.2 billion) as of 12 March 2020 would 
provide sufficient buffer against cash burn due to reduced revenue.
"We expect working capital drain due to the fall in revenues and also substantially lower deferred revenue from 
flight seats sold but not yet flown (the latter stood at (EURO)3 billion at end-March 2019), followed by recovery as 
new bookings return later this year. We will continue to monitor working capital movements in the coming months," 
it stated.
It noted defensive measures imposed by the carrier, including: grounding surplus aircraft; deferring all capital 
expenditure (Capex) and share buybacks; freezing recruitment and discretionary spending; implementing a series 
of voluntary leave options; temporarily suspending employment contracts; and significant reductions to working 
hours and payments.
In the case of Wizz, Fitch was encouraged by a large unrestricted cash position of (EURO)1.3 billion at end-2019, 
which should provide sufficient buffer against expected cash burn due to reduced revenue in the 2021 financial 
year, with the latter also mitigated by the company's action to reduce operating expenses and improve cash flows.

Amid the first murmerrings of a global air travel shutdown, airlines around the world are scrambling to adjust 
capacity to demand that continues to plummet in step with the spread of Covid-19.
Announcements of capacity slashes are rolling in on an almost hourly basis, and Airfinance Journal has already 
reported on deep cutbacks Asia, Europe and the USA, but the following are some of the latest developments:
In Europe, Air France-KLM will cut its capacity by up to 90% over the next two months.
Rival carrier group IAG, the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Vueling and Level, plans to cut capacity by 
75% for April and May, as compared with the prior-year period.
From 16 March, SAS will halt "most" of its flights "until there are yet again conditions to conduct commercial 
aviation".The Scandinavian carrier has temporarily laid off about 90% of its workforce.
Low-cost carrier Easyjet has implemented "significant" cancellations and warned that "these actions will continue on 
a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding of the majority of the easyJet fleet".
Ryanair, meanwhile, has suspended all Italy flights until early April, has canceled Polish services for much of the 
rest of March and has severely reduced flights to Spain.
Aeroflot has suspended flights between Moscow and cities including Barcelona, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Munich, 
Oslo, Prague, Vienna, Warsaw and Zurich.
In the Middle East, Kuwait has suspended all flights and local low-cost carrier Jazeera is reported to have put its 
fleet at the disposal of the state.
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad has suspended all flights to a variety of destinations - including Milan, Beirut, Istanbul, 
Madrid, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Riyadh and Shanghai - for periods ranging from until the end of March to the end of 
June, and reduced frequencies on many others.
From this week Israelie flag carrier El Al will put 80% of its employees on unpaid leave for an indefinite period, 
Israeli media has reported.

Other Israeli carriers Arkia and Israir have suspended all international flights until further notice.
In Japan, ANA has made adjustments that will affect 2,674 flights, with about half on its domestic network. Japan 
Airlines, meanwhile will cut about 1,500 domestic flights for most of the rest of March.

The coronavirus is likely to have a much shorter impact on the aviation sector than previous shocks such as the 
9/11 attacks and the global financial crisis, several European airline chief executives believe.
Speaking on a webcasted panel session at the A4E conference on 3 March, IAG CEO Willie Walsh said today's 
higher fuel costs compared with 2001 was incentivising airlines to ground aircraft rather than operate them with low 
seat load factors.
"What we saw post 9/11 was a very strong reluctance to travel on the transatlantic. But back then fuel was 10% to 
12% of our cost base, today it is 30%-plus for most people," said Walsh.
"So the incentive back in 2001 was to continue flying, airlines kept aircraft flying. We were flying around with seat 
factors in the thirties and forties. That's not happening this time around, when there is, much more incentive to keep 
the aircraft on the ground," he added.
Walsh said the airline industry was much more "rational" now. He predicted that air travel would recover quickly and 
"pretty strongly".
Ryanair group CEO Michael O'Leary said the coronavirus crisis was much different from 9/11 as it would be a 
"much shorter-lived phenomenon", noting that in 2001 the disruption was prolonged by the Iraq war.
O'Leary said that unlike in the period after the 9/11 attacks, Ryanair was not planning significant seat sales to 
stimulate demand.
He said that encouraging "unnecessary travel" was "entirely inappropriate", adding: "We are all in this together."
Air France-KLM group CEO Ben Smith said the current crisis was receiving much more "media attention" than 
previous events and that social media was playing a much greater role.
He said the group had registered a "huge impact" on travel to and from Asia while the reaction on transatlantic, 
European and African markets had been "relatively muted".
He said the Franco-Dutch carrier group expected the impact on the industry to be "short" and it had no plans to alter 
its fleet plans.
Coronavirus very different from 9/11 crisis: airlines
"We are going to need the aircraft we have ordered in our fleets," he said.
Lufthansa group CEO Carsten Spohr urged governments to lower taxes on aviation and for national slot regulators 
to relax the 80:20 rule to allow airlines to cut services without the risk of losing their airport slots.

Air Baltic has approached its shareholders about a possible future equity injection to support its operations through 
the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis.    Air Baltic chief executive officer Martin Gauss tells Airfinance Journal that the 
airline has spoken to both the Latvian state, which holds 80% of shares, and Lars Thuesen who holds the remaining 
20% for a possible cash injection, depending on how long the virus leaves aviation markets in virtual shutdown.   
"We are not looking for loans we are looking for equity, but not now; but we have informed them that this is 
something we would like to see," he says.
Gauss says both shareholders have "signalled their support" because it is "highly profitable" and has exceeded its 
forecasts.   He says plans for an initial public offering (IPO) in the future means that shareholders stand to get a 
partial return on part of that equity.    "We have informed our shareholders we would only be looking at equity 
because to go for an IPO afterwards, which was the intention, becomes even more interesting now, because if we 
can get our shareholders to inject additional equity at this time it would strengthen our balance sheet," he says.   He 
says the Riga-based airline is not looking for an "exact amount" and much will depend on the length of the crisis.    
The airline is also closely observing the temporary changes to state aid rules brought in by the European 
Commission to support businesses during the crisis and will observe these.   The Latvian national carrier is working 
to three possible scenarios, depending on whether the crisis lasts one month, three months or six months.   The 
airline has grounded all but a small number of domestic flights and repatriation and emergency flights after the 
Latvian state imposed a ban on all commercial flights earlier this month.   That ban is due to last until 14 April, but 
Gauss says Air Baltic is planning for it to be potentially extended.   Gauss says the regional carrier has a "strong" 
liquidity position, having secured a (EURO)200 million Eurobond in 2019. Half of this money was for growth and half 
was for a "rainy day", Gauss says.   He says the airline is in a "strong position compared to some competitors".   
"We are definitely not in a position of a Ryanair or Wizz Air, but we are definitely in a much better position on the 
cash than some of the major carriers today," Gauss says.     Air Baltic has approached its suppliers, including its 
lessors, for rental and other payment holidays.
While each request with individual lessors is different, Gauss says a three-month aircraft lease deferral would be 
"good", a six-month deferral would be "better".   Repossessing aircraft would not make sense from an airline that 
has had no interruption to payments in the past, he suggests.   "Of course it doesn't come for free, you have to pay 
interest and make other concessions, it's very dynamic and therefore it's an individual arrangement - you will not be 
able to do a global arrangement with lessors," he says.   Air Batlic has orders for 80 A220s, Gauss says, and is 
making its pre delivery payments on these "according to schedule", but is now reviewing the timeline of these 
Exclusive: Air Baltic considers possible equity injection
deliveries with the OEM.   Gauss says the airline is due to take delivery of an A220 within weeks, but it is now 
facing challenges as Airbus production is disrupted and national restrictions make it difficult to physically take 
possession of the aircraft.   The aircraft is financed through a sale and leaseback with an existing lessor and this 
remains on track, Gauss says. He expects appetite among lessors to finance future A220s to be strong given that 
the operating features of the aircraft remain compelling.   When Air Baltic is allowed to resume flights, it has put in 
place plans to operate a reduced schedule with 22 A220s only. The airline has reduced its workforce by 40%, or 
700 people, to cut costs and operate its reduced fleet. Gauss says the intention is to re-employ them once the crisis 
has ended.

Ryanair's Laudamotion subsidiary will receive five additional Airbus A320s over the coming weeks, adding to the 25 
of the type that it is already operating.
The five additional units will be supplied by Aercap, Castlelake, DAE Capital and Orix Aviation. This follows the 
addition of two A320s from GECAS in February.
Unlike its Ryanair parent, Laudamotion's entire fleet is on operating lease.
Of the five new aircraft to be added in March, a 2008-vintage unit will be supplied by Aercap; two former Airasia-
operated A320s - built in 2005 and 2006 - will come from Castlelake; a 2006-manufactured unit is from DAE 
Capital; and a 2011-vintage A320 formerly flying for India's Indigo will be supplied by Orix Aviation.
DAE Capital and Orix are new lessors to Laudamotion.
Laudamotion's 25 A320s in its current fleet come from 12 leasing companies.
In 2019, Laudamotion announced plans to purchase up to 100 Airbus A321neos for future expansion but no such 
order has been confirmed since. Recently speaking at A4E, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said that order

Alitalia's administrators have restarted the process to find a buyer for the Italian flag carrier.
A document posted on 6 March by administrator Giuseppe Leogrande requests expressions of interest for a 
consortium or company to take over Alitalia and Cityliner.
Interested parties have until 18 March to submit a bid.
The document shows that Rothschild, which handled previous attempts to privatise the airline, has been retained 
and is managing the process.
The Italian government has tried on numerous occasions to privatise the Skyteam carrier, which was placed into 
administration in 2017.
An attempt to form a consortium that included Italian state rail company Ferrovie dello Stato and logistics company 
Atlantia to take over the airline in late 2019 fell apart when Atlantia withdrew from the process.
At various times over the past three years Delta Air Lines, Easyjet, Lufthansa, Ryanair and Wizz Air have been 
linked to the process.
The airline is the subject of investigations by the European Commission into whether loans granted to it by the 
Italian government constitute illegal state aid.

Profit warnings from airlines are becoming as ubiquitous as delayed flights. Britain's IAG and easyJet are the latest 
to pile in, warning of virusstunted demand. They follow Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, and will be followed by others 
in turn.
The travel industry is notoriously sensitive: terrorism, disease, financial crises and erupting volcanoes have all taken 
their toll. It is also heavily indebted. Airlines last year had roughly 4.5 times as much net debt as they earned at 
operating level, trade body Iata estimated.
German holidays group Tui held net debt of (EURO)5bn at the end of the first quarter. This is 2.6 times forecast 
ebitda, but 5 times the level of earnings when economies were weak in 2012. According to S&P, cruise group 
Carnival's $11bn net debt is double 2020 forecasts for ebitda made before the epidemic spread. The price of 
insuring against bond defaults has spiked for both groups.
Among European airlines Air France-KLM flies highest with net debt/ebitda of 1.5 times. IAG is close behind. 
Discount airlines easyJet and Ryanair carry far lighter loads.
The coronavirus will expand these numbers. Iata expects a $29.3bn dent in airline revenues. China is in lockdown; 
Bali has reported no cases but had 40,000 bookings pulled in the past few weeks. Analysts are scratching industry 
earnings estimates lower.
Financially weak airlines and travel businesses may not survive the outbreak in their current form. The field has 
already been culled - Thomas Cook, India's Jet Airways, the UK's Monarch and Air Berlin have closed down or 
sought protection from creditors. Governments may step in.

This time around, governments should think twice before providing bailouts. The world airline industry has too much 
capacity and is highly polluting. It needs a clear out.

Profit warnings from airlines are becoming as ubiquitous as delayed flights. Britain's IAG and easyJet are the latest 
to pile in, warning of virusstunted demand. They follow Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, and will be followed by others 
in turn.
The travel industry is notoriously sensitive: terrorism, disease, financial crises and erupting volcanoes have all taken 
their toll. It is also heavily indebted. Airlines last year had roughly 4.5 times as much net debt as they earned at 
operating level, trade body Iata estimated.
German holidays group Tui held net debt of (EURO)5bn at the end of the first quarter. This is 2.6 times forecast 
ebitda, but 5 times the level of earnings when economies were weak in 2012. According to S&P, cruise group 
Carnival's $11bn net debt is double 2020 forecasts for ebitda made before the epidemic spread. The price of 
insuring against bond defaults has spiked for both groups.
Among European airlines Air France-KLM flies highest with net debt/ebitda of 1.5 times. IAG is close behind. 
Discount airlines easyJet and Ryanair carry far lighter loads.
The coronavirus will expand these numbers. Iata expects a $29.3bn dent in airline revenues. China is in lockdown; 
Bali has reported no cases but had 40,000 bookings pulled in the past few weeks. Analysts are scratching industry 
earnings estimates lower.
Financially weak airlines and travel businesses may not survive the outbreak in their current form. The field has 
already been culled - Thomas Cook, India's Jet Airways, the UK's Monarch and Air Berlin have closed down or 
sought protection from creditors. Governments may step in.

Hundreds of funds have slumped to double-digit weekly losses as stock markets have tumbled amid fears over the 
spread of the coronavirus.
Morningstar data shows 350 funds registered for sale to UK investors have suffered a loss of 10% or more over the 
rolling week to yesterday, not including the impact of renewed stock market falls today.
It’s a measure of how violent and indiscriminate the stock market sell-off has been that the hardest-hit funds are 
focused on varying sectors and geographies and employ different approaches.
US funds have broadly fared the worst, but some UK funds have been hit equally hard. Technology funds and those 
with a heavy growth focus have tumbled, but so too have recovery, special situations and value funds.
Funds investing in perceived safe havens, like government bonds and gold, have risen, while one fund run by 
bearish fund manager Tim Bond has soared.
Oil funds slump
Among funds readily accessible to UK investors, the £126m Guinness Global Energy  has been worst hit, tumbling 
12.4% as the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has tumbled from $58.50 to $50.55 over the last week. Junior Oils  
has fallen 11.3% and T Rowe Price Global Natural Resources  is down 10.2%.
While funds in the Investment Association’s North America sector litter the bottom of the performance charts over 
the last week, a UK strategy is one of the heaviest fallers.
Neil Vetich’s £147m SVM UK Opportunities  fund has tumbled 12.2%, hurt by positions in tumbling airline shares 
International Airlines Group (IAG), Ryanair (RYA.I) and Wizz Air (WIZZ), a 15% weighting to oil and gas 
companies and a broad bias towards cyclical stocks more exposed to the fluctuations of the global economy.
The fund is the worst performer in the Investment Association’s UK All Companies sector over the last five days and 
is joined at the bottom by Premier UK Growth , down 10.7%.
The funds hit hardest by the violent stock market sell-off
Two of the worst performing funds in the sector over the last five years continued to be hit hard this week. 
The £958m Jupiter UK Growth  fund, whose poor performance has culminated in the announcement this week that 
manager Steve Davies was leaving the fund group, fell 10.1% over the week to yesterday. 
The £1.9bn M&G Recovery  fund, dropped from Hargreaves Lansdown’s Wealth fund buy list last year and sold 
from the online stockbroker’s HL Multi-Manager Balanced Managed  fund, fell 10%.
Those two funds were among a host of value, recovery and special situations funds to perform poorly this week.
Growth and value suffer 
The £178m Investec Global Special Situations  fund, featuring a heavy weighting to US banks, fell 10.8% while 
Miton UK Value Opportunities  was down 9.7%.
But at the other end of the investment style spectrum to value funds, those focused on technology and growth 
stocks were also hit hard.
The £701m AXA Framlington WF Robotech fund  fell 11.8% while the £1.1bn Janus Henderson Global Technology  
fund was down 9.9%.
Funds with a broader focus on growth stocks joined them at the bottom of the week’s performance charts. The 
£842m Baillie Gifford Global Discovery  fund was down 9.5% while the Edinburgh fund group’s £2.5bn American  
fund fell 9.2%, as its £8bn Scottish Mortgage (SMT ) investment trust languished at the bottom of the FTSE 100.
Latin American funds also fared particularly poorly. The £389m Threadneedle Latin America  fund fell 11% and 
Invesco’s £119m Latin American  fund was down 10.5%.
The UK’s largest fund, the £19.3bn Fundsmith Equity , fell 7.4%, as Citywire AAA-rated manager Terry Smith this 
week told investors he was ‘pretty relaxed’ about the impact of the coronavirus on his strategy. 
Citywire AA-rated Nick Train’s £6.6bn Lindsell Train UK Equity  fund fell 6.8% while his Lindsell Train Global Equity  
fund was down 5.7%.
Havens rally, bear gains
Bond funds rallied amid the flight to safety over the week, with those investing in UK index-linked gilts performing 
particularly well. Index-linked gilt funds run by Baillie Gifford, AXA and BNY Mellon were up 3.4%, 3.2% and 3.1% 
respectively.
Among bond funds with a broader remit, the £767m Allianz Strategic Bond  fund was among the best performers, 
while the £888m Ruffer Gold  fund rose 2.7% as investors flocked to the precious metal.
The standout performer of the week was the small £55m Odey Odyssey  fund run by bearish fund manager Tim 
Bond, which surged 11.8%. 
But that represents just a small fillip to long-suffering investors in the fund, who have seen their holdings more than 
halve over the last five years.

Call it planning or planicking, companies across the City are making contingencies for workers forced by 
coronavirus fears to stay home.
Chevron, the US oil group, has sent home 300 staff from Canary Wharf. Meanwhile drinks group Diageo and airport 
caterer SSP have outlined what the illness is costing them in China. They are the first UK-headquartered 
companies to put hard numbers on the impact of the biggest quarantine of people in the world's largest industrial 
economy.
Neither won a prize for being first out of the traps. Shares in both fell yesterday. Coronavirus will test the thesis that 
disclosure aids price discovery and reduces volatility.
Diageo said that Covid-19 would reduce net sales - £12.9bn in total last year - by up to £325m and operating profits 
by up to £200m this year. Containment is hitting sales of baijiu, the white spirit drunk at Chinese banquets.
Shares in SSP fell 5 per cent when it highlighted the 90 per cent drop in air passenger numbers in China. In 
February its Asia revenues - less than a tenth of the total - halved year on year, it said.
Analysts are now reassessing the risk to travel in Europe and the US. SSP's shares have already fallen sharply in 
the past fortnight, as have those in airline and travel groups easyJet, Ryanair and Tui. JPMorgan Cazenove worries 
about a further derating.
Diageo's coronavirus disclosure creates as much doubt as clarity UK COMPANIES
Shares in restaurants and distributors of products passed from hand to hand and face to face will continue to 
oscillate. The winners in coming months are not obvious. Casino stocks have already suffered. But drug 
companies, often deemed to be defensive, rarely emerge triumphant from health crises. They hit the same supply-
chain blockages as others and can't get the right drugs to patients in time and at a profit. Rubber gloves, face 
masks and hand sanitisers make up small parts of the portfolios of Reckitt Benckiser and Bunzl, whose fortunes are 
tied more broadly to global growth.
The effects of the coronavirus epidemic will be twofold. The first, underlined by Diageo and SSP, is on consumers. 
Workers stay at home and cancel get-togethers. Machines stop. Trade and supply chains back up.
Then there is the effect on economic growth. It was not clear, said miner Rio Tinto yesterday, whether the recovery 
would be L-shaped or V-shaped. That depends on the ability of people to return to work and the shape of 
government stimuli.
Throughout this, share prices will be buffeted by bursts of data that compound uncertainty.

Feb 27, 2020( Kerry Underwood: http://kerryunderwood.wordpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The matters dealt 
with in this piece are examined in great detail in my three volume, 1,300 page book Personal Injury Small Claims, 
Portals and Fixed Costs - price 50 and available from Underwoods Solicitorshere[1]. Kerry Underwood offers 
consultancy services in relation to this and other matters and details arehere[2].  I have waited a long time to write 
up this decision, which, apart from being distinguishable on its facts in most other cases, is wrongly decided and 
one of the most anti access to justice decisions, even by the current Court of Appeal, which means it was faced with 
some stiff opposition. Just a reminder that this is the Court of Appeal which has brought you: UNISON - upholding 
Employment Tribunal fees - subsequently banned 7-0 by the Supreme Court; lawfulness of Johnson's proroguing 
Parliament - hammered 11-0 by the Supreme Court; Mitchell and relief from sanctions - had to overrule itself within 
months in Denton; Bott ... Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair - allowing Ryanair to respond direct to solicitors' clients avoiding 
the solicitor getting paid - in clear breach of the Supreme Court's own ruling in Gavin Edmondson - Supreme Court 
has given permission to appeal; Swift v Carpenter [2020] EWCA Civ 165i - No Protective Costs Order.  Mis-
Reporting  The decision has been further damaged by hopeless misreporting and some unfortunate comments by 
the successful lawyers. 
I understand, and support, the cab rank principle but gloating about a decision which threatens access to justice for 
most of the population is a different kettle of fish. PJ Kirby QC, who appeared for the successful Ms Herbert in the 
Court of Appeal, quoted various headlines in a piece entitled 'Herbert v HH Law: What does it mean for you?' 
'Upsurge in costs challenges looms after court rules on 100% success fee The ruling will set alarm bells ringing in 
the personal injury sector, with many firms having adopted the policy of setting a 100% success fee and claiming 
the maximum limit of 25% of total damages.' Law Society Gazette 'Success fee ruling could open assessment 
'floodgates'' - Litigation Futures ' few can doubt that life for low-value personal injury claimant solicitors has become 
increasingly difficult over the past decade. Herbert v HH Law provides no respite.' Partners in Costs 'Court of 
Appeal rules against blanket 100% success fee in low-value PI claims since LASPO' - Association of Costs 
Lawyers 'Court of Appeal holds that 100% success fee lawful provided solicitor can show informed consent No 
problem if you see your client and explain' - Kerry Underwood 'Going forwards, it is likely to be an uphill struggle, 
when entering into new CFAs, to show that the average lay client has given informed consent to a success fee that 
15% SUCCESS FEE: HERBERT AND COURT OF APPEAL: WRONG IN LAW, WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND 
DISTINGUISHABLE
does not fairly reflect the risks of the case.' Simon Gibbs of GWS.  Mis-Understanding  Adam Grant, Policy Officer 
at the Association of Costs Lawyers, in his Practical Law Dispute Resolution Blog of 20 May 2019 - Solicitor/client 
success fees and Herbert v HH Law Ltd said: 'Today the deductions of the success fee from damages are, in many 
cases, merely making up the shortfall in costs not recovered between the parties on successful cases, let alone the 
unsuccessful ones. To have this reduced significantly below the statutory cap could well leave a black hole in many 
a firm's finances.' That may in fact be what is happening, as indeed happened here, but it is entirely the wrong way 
of billing under the Solicitors Act 1974. What should happen is that a final statute bill under the Solicitors Act 1974 
be delivered to the client for unrecovered solicitor and own client costs. Given that nearly all solicitors cap the total 
charge to the client, and not just the success fee element, at 25% of damages, the success fee very often does not 
come into play. Mr Grant's argument that those charges will be subject to scrutiny as the client does not know how 
much they will be, is misinformed. That is the position in every hourly rate retainer and a Conditional Fee 
Agreement is an hourly rate retainer with the twist that the client does not have to pay on defeat. Solicitors are 
obliged in all cases, including Conditional Fee Agreement cases, to provide the client with full costs information, 
estimates and regular updates. The case did not decide that on a solicitor and own client assessment the additional 
liability in a simple personal injury case should never exceed 15%. What it did decide is that if a risk assessment is 
not to be undertaken, then the solicitor must obtain informed consent from the client in order to satisfy CPR 46.9(3), 
and that would require the client's approval after a full and fair explanation. In this case that would have required the 
solicitor to tell the client that the success fee took no account of individual risks, but was charged as standard. The 
fact that very many firms used the same business model of 100% success fees in all cases did not avoid this 
requirement. Practical Law correctly reported the decision: ' personal injury practices are likely to have fees reduced 
on assessment if they did not advise clients that success fees were not set on the basis of risk assessment'.  After-
the-Event Insurance Premium Cannot Be Challenged  The Court of Appeal also considered whether the cost of the 
After-the-Event insurance premium should be treated as a solicitor's disbursement, or merely an entry in the client 
cash account. It held that a disbursement qualifies as a solicitor's disbursement if: '(1) it is a payment which the 
solicitor is, as such, obliged to make whether or not to put in funds by the client, such as court fees, counsel's fees, 
and witnesses' expenses; or (2) there is a custom of the profession that the particular disbursement is properly 
treated as included in the bill as a solicitors' disbursement.' It held that an After-the- Event insurance premium fell 
into neither category, being a premium on a policy of insurance by which the client was insured pursuant to a 
contract they entered into with insurer. It was not a litigation cost at all and there was no evidence of a custom of 
including the premium within a solicitor's bill to the client, as opposed to a between the parties' bill. Consequently, it 
need only appear in the cash account and is not susceptible to assessment, although under section 70 of the 
Solicitors Act 1974 the court also considers the cash account as well as the solicitor's bill. Practice Direction 46, 
paragraph 6.6(b) describes it as: 'An account that includes money received by the solicitor to the credit of the client 
and sums paid out of that money on behalf of the client, but excludes outgoing payments that were made in 
satisfaction of the bill.' Paragraph 6.19 of the Practice Direction states: 'After the detailed assessment hearing is 
concluded the court will  (a) complete the court copy of the bill so as to show the amount allowed;  (b) determine the 
result of the cash account.' The purpose of the cash account is to enable the court to see the full extent of the 
solicitor's financial dealings with the client, since it will show sums expended on items which have not appeared in 
the bill. The solicitor can only recover items which the court certifies have been reasonably charged in the bill. 
There is no obligation on the client to pay for anything that has not appeared in the bill. Thus, it is essential to know 
what is and what is not a disbursement, since if, by accident or design, the solicitor misses a valid disbursement off 
the bill, it is irrecoverable from the client on a section 70 assessment. The cash account deals with money 
expended by the solicitor on behalf of the client for anything which is not in the bill, or which ought not to be there 
and includes items which the solicitor is not bound by law or custom to pay.  The Success Fee Decision Bizarrely, 
the original judgment - and of course on appeal it is always the original judgment, and not subsequent appeal 
decisions, which is under review - was a paper assessment, by consent of the parties, with no oral hearing - see the 
judgment of District Judge Bellamy, 28 April 2017[3]. The District Judge found that there was no clear evidence that 
the client had given informed consent to incur the 100% success fee. The supreme irony of this case is that in fact 
there was no success fee at all. All of the costs actually charged to Ms Herbert, as compared with those recovered 
from the other side, could have been charged as unrecovered solicitor and own client costs. However HH Law, 
presumably unaware of the law, and certainly unaware of the Underwoods Method, did not do so, but rather 
delivered a Solicitors Act 1974 statute bill wrongly describing the charge as a success fee and that wrongly 
15% SUCCESS FEE: HERBERT AND COURT OF APPEAL: WRONG IN LAW, WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND 
DISTINGUISHABLE
described charge was the subject of the litigation, and ultimately the Court of Appeal decision. HH Law Ltd 
submitted a witness statement from a Mr Craig Ralph dated 20 March 2017, which read, in part: '6. As a firm, we 
considered that the easiest and most transparent way was to make a solicitor own client charge, by way of a 
success fee which the client could pay out of damages. The success fee would be based on the basic costs that we 
actually recovered from the other side, thus limiting the fee. 7. We considered that clients would readily understand 
that method in principle, and we also thought it was fair, as the client's interests would be protected by the statutory 
cap on deductions from certain categories of damages of 25%. An individual client would therefore always retain 
75% (at least) of his/her damages. 8. Conversely, charging the client an increased hourly rate, or requiring the client 
to pay hourly rates when only fixed costs were going to be recovered in many cases, seemed to us to be more 
cumbersome, result in the hardest fought and most difficult cases carrying the heaviest burden of irrecoverable 
costs and less fair.' I cannot even begin to analyze the thinking behind that statement and method, particularly the 
idea that it is unfair for a client with the most difficult and hard fought case to risk paying more, albeit capped at 25% 
of damages. Ben Williams QC, one of the top cost lawyers in the country, commenting on Simon Gibbs' blog said: 
'There is no obligation for a success fee to reflect risk between solicitor and own client, so long as the client 
appreciates the basis on which it is set. Why can't a solicitor say: 'you have two options - win or lose payment, or no 
win-no fee payment; for no win-no fee, I require a premium of 100 per cent to act on those terms. This premium is 
not based on risk, it is simply the consideration I stipulate for the CFA terms which I am not otherwise willing to 
give'? If the client chooses the latter option, why should he be able to revisit that?' As one would expect from Ben 
Williams QC, this is absolutely correct. It is something which judges appear not to understand; that is that the 
alternative to a success fee model which makes a reasonable profit for the solicitor to reflect the fact that they will 
not be paid if they lose, is to pay the full hourly rate win or lose. The alternative is not some cooked up, half baked, 
unprofitable, unworkable scheme devised by Court of Appeal judges who have not the slightest idea what it is like 
to practice as a solicitor in the real world and spent their legal careers earning fat fees, win or lose. Ben Williams 
also makes a point that I have always made, and that is that no business model can work if it simply puts a risk-
taker in the same position as they would have been had they not taken the risk; very obviously no one would ever 
take a risk if that was the case. The point is that the whole model of success fees being cost neutral is an utter 
nonsense - as I make crystal clear in my book on the subject - No Win, No Fee, No Worries. Furthermore, given the 
particular success fee model, this does not work, even on its own terms. The maximum success fee is 100%, and 
that is assumed to be appropriate if the risk is 50% - that is win one, lose one and you break even because you get 
a 100% success fee on the winner. Let us assume that the charge in each case is 10,000. If you charged, win or 
lose, the traditional business model, then by winning one case and losing one case you get paid 20,000.On a no-
win, no-win fee basis you get the following:  - lost case 0 - won case 10,000 - 100% success fee 10,000 Total 
20,000Thus the solicitor breaks even on that model, but gets no reward for taking the risk. However, as Ben points 
out - and I set out his comment below - how does that work if the chances of winning are 40%? On the theoretical 
model the success fee would have to be over 100% for the solicitor to break even as compared with charging the 
full rate, win or lose. However, the maximum success fee in any type of case is 100%. I set out Ben Williams QC's 
comments in full: '(1) The whole notion that a success fee should only reflect the pure 'burning cost' of risk, and 
should therefore be cost neutral across a solicitor's book of cases, was always dubious, and should never have 
been accepted without challenge. It's all very well to say that a solicitor who takes on 100 CFA cases on a 100% 
success fee will break even so long as she wins 50, which she will do on average (assuming 50/50 risk, else adjust 
figures as appropriate). But suppose he wins only 40? That is obviously a real possibility, as risk assessment is 
inherently uncertain. If this happens, she will not be able to pay her staff, and she goes bankrupt. That's a risk that a 
solicitor who refuses CFA terms would not face. The solicitor taking on the CFA work ought to be able to charge a 
*premium* for this sort of risk. It is not enough to break even on a theoretical basis. (2) A lot of solicitors will now be 
regretting the standard Law Soc CFA that says 'this is not a contentious business agreement'. If the CFA was a 
contentious business agreement, the ability of client's to attack success fees retrospectively would now be reduced. 
Compare the HH case to the failure of the challenge to the success fee under a non-contentious business 
agreement in Bolt Burdon v Tariq. (3) The confirmation that an ATE premium is not a solicitor's disbursement re-
ignites an issue that the courts have always ducked: on what basis does the court purport to adjust the 
methodology of a policy if the substituted methodology could never have been obtained by the receiving party or 
her solicitor in the market? The court has no power to alter the policy itself. The court can only act if the client and 
solicitor took out an unreasonable policy. But how can the policy be unreasonable if there was not a better 
15% SUCCESS FEE: HERBERT AND COURT OF APPEAL: WRONG IN LAW, WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND 
DISTINGUISHABLE
alternative that actually existed in the market?' What the Court of Appeal in fact does, but in a clumsy and unhelpful 
way, is to make clear that to get any sort of workable success fee, the client must be seen, and a full explanation 
given. PJ Kirby QC, who appeared for the successful Ms Herbert, said: 'It is possible to have 100% success fee the 
question is whether the client has given informed consent to the same. It is unlikely that a court would be satisfied 
that informed consent had been given unless there had been a face to face meeting with the client where the fees 
had been explained and where it had been made clear that the success fee that was being charged was not based 
on the risk involved in their particular case. It would probably also be necessary to explain that success fees had 
previously always been calculated by reference to risk and that a risk related success fee would be much lower. It 
may also be necessary to explain that other solicitors may charge a success fee by reference to the risk involved 
and that they would therefore deduct a smaller amount from the recovered damages.  Here is my write up of the 
original appeal decision of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court in Herbert v HH Law Ltd [2018] EWHC 
580 (QB)[4]. Success Fee and Risk In Herbert v HH Law Limited [2018] EWHC 580 (QB)[5] the Queen's Bench 
Division of the High Court upheld the decision of DJ Bellamy whereby he reduced the success fee in a road traffic 
accident case from 100% to 15% on a solicitor and own client assessment. The court also upheld a finding that an 
After-the-Event insurance premium was a solicitor's disbursement. The Court of Appeal has now given leave to 
appeal against the High Court's findings. The District Judge accepted the defendant's submission that CPR 46.9 
'places the burden on the client to prove the charges are unreasonable. It also significantly restricts the scope of the 
court's discretion to interfere with contractually agreed amounts through the mechanism of the presumptions.' The 
District Judge took into account that the solicitors never met the client and 'had little or no direct contact with the 
client.' Paragraph 20 of the judgment quoting paragraph 12 of the District Judge's judgment: 'The Claimant appears 
to have been referred to the solicitors (details unclear from the file) and the solicitors take instructions on the 
telephone. There is no face-to-face meeting subsequent to that discussion but there followed significant 
correspondence, terms and conditions, and documentation in relation to the CFA. There is no evidence on the file 
of any formal risk assessment, nor note of any discussion in relation to the success fee. Whilst accepting the 
retainer between solicitor and client is contractual in nature, the reality is that litigation funding of itself is complex, 
risk assessments and success fees add a further level of complication, as does the charging arrangement of the 
solicitors. This is an unsophisticated client dealing, by referral, with a claim for damages arising out of a road traffic 
incident, the circumstances of which appear from the file note relatively straightforward, it being a rear end collision 
with the claimant's stationary car. It seems to me not a difficult hurdle in those circumstances for a Claimant to 
overcome to rebut the presumption of reasonableness in CPR 46.9(3). There is no clear evidence the Claimant 
approved either expressly or impliedly, with full knowledge, the cost to be incurred, and more particularly, a success 
fee of 100% could easily be said to be unusual both in nature and amount given the circumstances of the claim that 
were known to the solicitors at the time. Further, there is no risk assessment on the file that would in any event 
justify as being reasonable, a success fee of 100%'.' The High Court held that approval required informed consent 
by the client and that 'the simple refrain of freedom of contract establishes neither the presumptions nor the 
reasonableness of the success fee in the particular case.' The High Court also held that risk was likely to be the 
primary factor in fixing the success fee (Paragraph 44).The key paragraphs are 46 and 47: '46. Like the Judge, I 
accept that 46.9(4) is not free-standing and that CPR 46.9 must be read as a whole. Thus if a client applies for a 
reduction in the success fee, he may be met by evidence that he gave his informed approval to the percentage 
identified in the CFA. If so, the presumption in 46.9(3)(a) and/or (b) is likely to be satisfied and will be difficult to 
dislodge. Alternatively, if the presumption is not established, the costs judge will proceed to the assessment and 
hence the reasonableness of the success fee percentage. 47. Putting the point another way, if and insofar as HH 
took no account of the risk in the individual case and provided for a 100% uplift (subject to the 25% cap) in all cases 
by reason of its particular post-LASPO business model, I consider that informed approval would require this to be 
clearly explained to the client before she entered the agreement.' This leaves open the question of whether a 
solicitor who has met the client and explained everything in the manner recommended in Vilvarajah v West London 
Law Ltd [2017] EWHC B23 (Costs)[6] is safe from attack on the success fee.  Comment This decision is all over the 
place, but it is not clear here what the basis of the charge to the client was. The actual costs charged to the client 
was 691 plus VAT, being 25% of the damages. The claim was an ex-portal RTA claim which settled for 3,400 after 
proceedings had been issued and, although it is not clear from the judgment, I am assuming that post-issue pre-
listing fixed costs applied and if that is the case the recoverable costs are 1,840 being 20% of the damages plus 
1,160 as per CPR 45.29 Table 6 B. Here the solicitor and own client basis of charging was 118 an hour with 22 
15% SUCCESS FEE: HERBERT AND COURT OF APPEAL: WRONG IN LAW, WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND 
DISTINGUISHABLE
hours work done giving a total 2,596. Thus the unrecovered solicitor and own client costs are as follows:  solicitor 
and own client costs 2,596 less recovered costs 1,840 Total 756 These are costs net of VAT, and as we have seen 
the actual charge to the client was 691 plus VAT. Consequently, unless I am missing something, there was in fact 
no success fee at all in this case as all of the charge to the client fell within the unrecovered element of solicitor and 
own client costs. Clearly 118 per hour is a very modest rate and appears not to have been challenged. In those 
circumstances, the decision appears to be obiter, in the sense that the court did not need to rule on the success fee 
as in law no actual success fee was charged. It is well established law that academic claims cannot be brought; in 
other words the client cannot bring a Solicitors Act 1974 challenge in relation to a bill never delivered, even if the 
retainer contained challengeable provisions. If I am correct, and this decision is obiter, then of course it is not 
binding. As far as I am aware there has been no successful challenge in any court in the country to the Underwoods 
Method, and contrary to some ill-informed comment, this decision supports, rather than challenges the Underwoods 
Method. What solicitors may now well start to do, particularly given the increase in the small claims limit in personal 
injury matters, is to reserve the right to charge the full element of the unrecovered solicitor and own client costs, 
either completely uncapped, or possibly capped at say 40% of damages, and then charge a 15% success fee as 
well. Obviously, this means that the client will receive far less of their damages than at present. Whether that was 
clear to the Court of Appeal or not, I do not know, but it is blindingly obvious to anyone who actually considers these 
matters and has experience of them. This is as Pyrrhic a victory as it gets - instead of all solicitors routinely capping 
the total charges to the client, be that unrecovered solicitor and own client costs and/or the success fee, at 25% of 
damages, solicitors will now be forced to adopt a different model. The Underwoods Method avoids these 
challenges, and I have always advised capping the total charge to the client at 25% of damages. However, as such 
reasonableness and generosity on the part of solicitors has been treated with complete contempt by the Court of 
Appeal, I see no reason why solicitors should continue to be so generous to their clients. My advice now is to cap 
the total charge to the client at 40%, not 25%, but to charge the full unrecovered solicitor and own client costs at the 
full normal private rate. [ 1]: http://www.underwoods-solicitors.co.uk/book-kerry-underwood.htm [ 2]:

Panic spreads faster than a pandemic. That might not make it irrational. Signs that the coronavirus is going global 
sent share prices plummeting this week. But equity valuations are stretched - the Stoxx Europe 600 reached a 
record high last week.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett this week described the outbreak as "scary stuff" but cautioned against selling 
on the headlines. The Sars outbreak of 2002-03 showed that prices can bounce back sharply once an infection 
subsides.
But already Covid-19 has infected 10 times as many people as did Sars and killed more than three times as many 
people. China is a far bigger part of global production and consumption than was the case in 2003. The hit to global 
GDP will be even worse if Covid-19 is not confined to Asia. European travel stocks have borne the brunt this week. 
Italy, one of the continent's biggest short-haul destinations, is a hotspot for the disease, with 283 confirmed cases 
and seven deaths.
Hotel groups were hit; Accor, which has 86 hotels in Italy, more than most peers. Its market value fell about 8 per 
cent. EasyJet was even worse hit, down 17 per cent. Flights to southern Europe account for a third of its revenue. 
Ryanair, which earns a fifth of its sales from flights to Italy, was close behind.
The Italian outbreak is in the north, its industrial heartland. Disruption to supply chains could be an issue. As in 
China, small companies play an important role. They, too, might end up perilously strapped for cash. Italy faces a 
rising likelihood of a recession. All this would be bad news for Europe's banks, too: more bad loans, less hope of 
needed rate rises.
European shares/ coronavirus: fright club Twitter : @FTLex
China's experience suggests other losers and winners. Gambling operators, property developers, restaurants and 
sellers of big-ticket items have been hit. Online education companies, surgical-mask makers and games designers 
are potential beneficiaries. The defensive merits of healthcare and certain online services have been evident. 
Online education companies have been in demand, as forced closures of schools unleash a bevy of home learning.
Nervous investors can also look to the central banks for support. Extra liquidity will stimulate demand. But that will 
not be enough to immunise portfolios from the virus.
Expect havens such as gold, dollars and Treasuries to stay in demand.

 Boeing (BA) is in talks with some of its top customers about funding simulator training on the 737 MAX once the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows it to fly again, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing people familiar 
with the matter. 
Sources said Boeing will cover simulator training for pilots of Indian airlines SpiceJet Ltd., while it remains in talks 
with FlyDubai and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) about a similar compensation, the news outlet said.
Meanwhile, other airlines including Southwest Airlines (LUV) are also preparing to train their pilots on the 737 MAX, 
the report said. Simulator maker CAE Inc. also earlier said that it had begun making 737 MAX simulators even 
without orders.
Boeing's 737 MAX has been grounded since last year following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.

Feb 26, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Schneider 
National SNDR[1] have lost 10.7% against the industry[2]'s 5.2% rise in a year's time. The below-par performance 
was primarily caused by unfavorable pricing and closure of First to Final Mile ('FTFM') operations.Let's take a look 
at the factors that are responsible for the dismal price performance.Revenues in the truckload segment declined 
(8.3% in 2019) due to lower freight demand against higher truck capacity. Also, revenues in the logistics unit fell 
8.7% in 2019. Moreover, this situation is unlikely to improve in the near term.Additionally, closure of FTFM 
operations within the truckload unit is limiting bottom-line growth due to increased costs. 
Moreover, the return on equity (expressed as a percentage) for the company is currently 10 compared with 15.6 for 
its industry. This indicates that the company does not utilize shareholders' funds efficiently.Deterioration in 
operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is also a concern. Evidently, the metric (on an 
adjusted basis) came in at 95.6% in 2019 compared with 92.4% in 2018.Also, the company has an unimpressive 
record with respect to earnings per share. Schneider has trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 12.2%, 
on average.Negative Estimate Revisions and Zacks RankThe pessimism surrounding the stock is evident from the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised downward by 5.9% in the past 60 days to 
$1.28.Additionally, Schneider National carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks

Airlines, Shipping Likely to Be Most Affected by Coronavirus Outbreak, Berenberg Says
Airlines, Shipping Likely to Be Most Affected by Coronavirus Outbreak, 
Berenberg Says
MT Newswires Live Briefs

 Berenberg Research said in a note to clients  that the airlines and shipping sectors would likely be the most 
affected by the COVID-19 virus outbreak. 
According to the firm, airports, integrators and freight forwarders will likely be affected, but to a lesser degree. 
Overall, Berenberg expects Q1 to be weak across much of the broader sector, and that the effects could become 
more wide-ranging if the virus spreads beyond China "in a substantial way."
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surged over the past week in Italy, South Korea and Iran, where 
local authorities are scrambling to contain the outbreak. Switzerland, Spain and Croatia have also reported their first 
cases on Tuesday, according to British publication The Guardian.There are now over 80,000 cases, with the death 
toll reaching over 2,700 worldwide, CNN reported. The World Health Organization has also recommended the 
preparation for a possible pandemic, despite its officials saying it's too early to declare.
For the airlines segment of their coverage, Berenberg said it forecasts less net long-haul capacity. The firm is 
expecting more US domestic growth to lead to gradually lower unit revenue, which anticipates disruption through 
the summer schedules. The firm trimmed its estimates for low-cost carrier revenue, including Ryanair's (RYAAY), to 
reflect softer bookings in Italy.
Meanwhile, United Airlines can somehow manage to dampen its high Asia and cargo exposure through its 
approximately $400 million in incremental co-brand card revenue. The firm estimates United's US-China daily 
revenue to be more than that of Delta Airlines and American Airlines (AAL) combined.
The US legacy carriers, namely United, Delta and American, are less exposed to limited capacity than its European 
counterparts, Berenberg said. Chinese airlines, on the other hand, experienced 70% fewer passengers year over 
year, at 10.2 million, in the 12 days to Feb. 12, according to its regulator.
Airlines, Shipping Likely to Be Most Affected by Coronavirus Outbreak, Berenberg Says
On Thursday last week, the International Air Transport Association said that the COVID-19 virus will cost the global 
airline industry billions in lost revenue.
Airlines could experience lost revenue totaling $29.3 billion globally, IATA said.
Berenberg also sees the container shipping suffering from "very weak volumes in Q1, with limited offsets from rates 
or
fuel."
"We estimate that lower exports from China in Q1 could have an impact of as much as 8% to 10% on container 
volumes in the quarter," Berenberg said.
Meanwhile, freight forwarders' organic growth will likely be impacted by lower volumes, but more flexible business 
models should help companies, according to the report.
Among integrators, the firm said Deutsche Post appears most at risk in its coverage, while FedEx (FDX) and UPS 
(UPS) have limited exposure, with about 2% of their revenue coming from China, according to the report.

       European stocks opened on a positive note Tuesday after suffering their biggest slump since mid-2016 the 
previous day on worries about the coronavirus outbreak that has spread far beyond China to Europe and the Middle 
East. 
 On the data front, the second estimate of fourth quarter German GDP published today showed that Europe's 
largest economy remained in stagnation in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to Brexit uncertainty and international 
trade conflicts.  
 The pan European Stoxx 600 edged up 0.3 percent to 412.98 after plunging as much as 3.8 percent in the 
previous session. The German DAX, France's CAC 40 index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were up between 0.1 
percent and 0.2 percent. 
 Leoni AG shares slumped 8 percent. The provider of energy and data management solutions in the automotive 
market reported 2019 preliminary sales of 4.8 billion euros, lower than prior year's 5.1 billion euros.
 Norwegian energy company Equinor advanced 1.3 percent. The company, formerly Statoil ASA, said that it has 
decided to discontinue its exploration drilling plan in the Ceduna sub-basin, offshore South Australia, as the 
project's potential is not commercially competitive.
 Supermarket giant Tesco edged up slightly after announcing the sale of its 20 percent share in Gain Land to a unit 
of its JV partner, China Resources. 
 Dutch consumer electronics giant Philips Electronics NV dropped 1 percent. The company said it is another step 
closer to becoming carbon-neutral in its own operations in 2020, with its U.S. and Dutch facilities now 100 percent-
powered by renewable electricity.
European Shares Inch Higher After Steep Selloff
 Spanish utility Iberdrola S.A. rose about half a percent. The company said it would start a new share buyback 
program, which will repurchase about 1.57 billion euros of its shares. 
 Prudential rallied 2.5 percent after a U.S. hedge fund and activist investor took a near-$2bn (£1.5bn) stake in the 
London-based insurer Prudential and called for it to separate into two companies.
 Hammerson, a British property development and investment company, added 1.5 percent despite posting a wider 
loss for the full year 2019, reflecting higher revaluation losses on properties and other net losses. 
 AstraZeneca was moving lower. The drug major said it has agreed to sublicense its global rights to Movantik, a 
peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, to 
RedHill Biopharma.
 Airline stocks were moving higher after taking their biggest hit on Monday. Lufthansa was marginally higher, 
easyJet gained half a percent and Ryanair rose 1.5 percent.

Global markets tumbled sharply yesterday as a surge of coronavirus cases outside China rattled investors and 
dashed hopes the outbreak had been www.contained.UK stocks had their worst day in five years, with airlines and 
tour operators among the hardest hit. Shares in easyJet fell 17 per cent and Ryanair 13 per cent.
Europe bore the brunt of the sell-off, with Italy's MIB index dropping 5.4 per cent - its biggest fall since 2016.
In the US, the Nasdaq was down 3.5 per cent at midday with the S&P 500 3 per cent lower. The sell-off was led by 
travel companies including American Airlines and Norwegian Cruise Line. It was the worst showing since August for 
both benchmarks.
Investors flocked to the safety of government debt, pushing the yield on the US 10-year Treasury down 11 basis 
points to 1.36 per cent, a touch above its record low. Robert Carnell, chief Asia-Pacific economist at ING, said the 
virus was "no longer solely an Asia issue".
The market turmoil came after new evidence that the virus was spreading. Italy imposed a quarantine across at 
least 10 towns over the weekend in an effort to contain the biggest outbreak outside Asia, with 229 confirmed 
infections and six deaths.

South Korea reported 231 new cases, bringing the total number of infections to 833. The government added it had 
put 7,000 troops under quarantine after 11 had tested positive.
Iran said there had been 12 deaths and 61 confirmed cases in the country. Turkey closed its borders with Iran, 
while Iraq, Afghanistan, Armenia and Pakistan have imposed restrictions on border crossings and trade. Despite 
the outbreak in Italy, EU authorities said there were no plans to suspend travel in the 26-country Schengen area of 
visa-free travel. "We need to take this situation extremely seriously - but we must not give in to panic and of course 
to disinformation," said Stella Kyriakides, EU health commissioner.
Bruce Aylward, head of the World Health Organization's team of foreign experts in China, praised Beijing's 
response, saying it had implemented "the only successful measures we have seen". He said the turning point in 
Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had been reached, with more people leaving hospital than entering.
Meanwhile, the price of Brent crude fell 5.4 per cent to $55.38 a barrel. Gold rallied 1.9 per cent to $1674.70 per 
troy ounce. "The outbreak is starting to rattle asset markets and should keep weighing on commodities' demand," 
said Aakash Doshi, Citigroup commodities research head in North America. In Europe, the continent-wide Stoxx 
600 fell 3.8 per cent, while the FTSE 100 ended the day 3.3 per cent lower. That followed heavy falls in Asia where

Global markets tumbled sharply yesterday as a surge of coronavirus cases outside China rattled investors and 
dashed hopes the outbreak had been www.contained.UK stocks had their worst day in five years, with airlines and 
tour operators among the hardest hit. Shares in easyJet fell 17 per cent and Ryanair 13 per cent.
Europe bore the brunt of the sell-off, with Italy's MIB index dropping 5.4 per cent - its biggest fall since 2016.
In the US, the Nasdaq was down 3.5 per cent at midday with the S&P 500 3 per cent lower. The sell-off was led by 
travel companies including American Airlines and Norwegian Cruise Line. It was the worst showing since August for 
both benchmarks.
Investors flocked to the safety of government debt, pushing the yield on the US 10-year Treasury down 11 basis 
points to 1.36 per cent, a touch above its record low. Robert Carnell, chief Asia-Pacific economist at ING, said the 
virus was "no longer solely an Asia issue".
The market turmoil came after new evidence that the virus was spreading. Italy imposed a quarantine across at 
least 10 towns over the weekend in an effort to contain the biggest outbreak outside Asia, with 229 confirmed 
infections and six deaths.

South Korea reported 231 new cases, bringing the total number of infections to 833. The government added it had 
put 7,000 troops under quarantine after 11 had tested positive.
Iran said there had been 12 deaths and 61 confirmed cases in the country. Turkey closed its borders with Iran, 
while Iraq, Afghanistan, Armenia and Pakistan have imposed restrictions on border crossings and trade. Despite 
the outbreak in Italy, EU authorities said there were no plans to suspend travel in the 26-country Schengen area of 
visa-free travel. "We need to take this situation extremely seriously - but we must not give in to panic and of course 
to disinformation," said Stella Kyriakides, EU health commissioner.
Bruce Aylward, head of the World Health Organization's team of foreign experts in China, praised Beijing's 
response, saying it had implemented "the only successful measures we have seen". He said the turning point in 
Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had been reached, with more people leaving hospital than entering.

EasyJet and Ryanair led a sharp drop in Europe's airline shares yesterday as coronavirus in Italy ignited fears that 
travel in the continent would grind to a halt.
Participants most exposed to Europe were hardest hit on a day marked by steep declines on stock markets from 
London to Milan.
EasyJet shares were down 16.7 per cent, Ryanair fell 13.8 per cent, and Accor, one of Europe's largest hotel 
groups, dropped 5.6 per cent.
"What had been priced in by the market so far was weakness in China and a little bit of spillover into Asia Pacific 
from concerns about Chinese tourists not travelling so much," Harry Martin, a leisure analyst at Bernstein, said. "But 
today the panic is if we are going to have a global slowdown in travel."
The concern in markets came as Brussels said it had no plans to suspend the Schengen free travel zone and 
warned against a "panic" reaction to the news that Italian authorities had quarantined at least 10 towns in the north 
of the country.
The threat of disruption to European travel comes on top of the slowdown hoteliers and airlines have faced in 
China. "If [coronavirus] spreads further - say more widely into Europe - then we believe travel and lodging 
companies would be among the first to experience subdued earnings and cash flows," analysts at S&P Global said.
Italy contagion knocks hotels, airlines and tour operators; Travel & leisure
Investors were not hanging around to find out: European carriers were subject to heavy selling. Shares in IAG, 
parent of British Airways, and Air France-KLM were each down 10 per cent. Norwegian suffered an 8 per cent slide.
The International Air Transport Association warned last week that the virus would mean a $1bn hit for airline 
industry revenues, as it scrapped its forecast that passenger numbers would rise this year.
InterContinental and Accor were punished hardest among hoteliers, as investors targeted those companies with 
significant exposure to Europe.
InterContinental generates about 30 per cent of revenues in Europe, while Accor relied on the continent for more 
than half its sales last year.
Tour operators did not escape. Shares in Tui, the largest, fell almost 11 per cent, while those in Carnival were down 
6 per cent.
Travel executives said that they awaited further guidance from the World Health Organization, pointing to a sharp 
rebound the market enjoyed in 2003 when Sars was contained.
Kevin Kopelman, an equity analyst at investment bank Cowen, said that affected regions began to recover three to 
four months after the first report of Sars and that the market returned to "pre-outbreak levels" later the same year.

Investors are on edge as cases in As recently as Friday, BlackRock was bristling at the nervous rally in US 
government bonds, saying the decline in 30-year Treasury yields was excessive. Rick Rieder, chief investment 
officer, said he was trimming exposure to long-dated Treasuries after the yield dropped under 1.9 per cent. "With 
bad news, everyone goes one way," he said. "You want to try to be on the other side of it."

Investor nerves were reawakened over the weekend, when the virus prompted Italy to quarantine 10 towns in the 
north that produce about half the country's economic output, according to Citigroup. "The impact on firstquarter 
GDP is likely to be large, even if containment measures last only for one week," the bank said yesterday, adding 
that it doubted the disruption would be so short.
An acceleration of cases in South Korea and Iran is also stirring fears that the virus is running out of control.
Italian stocks have led declines, dropping nearly 6 per cent www.yesterday.UK stocks fell nearly 4 per cent, with

markets since the financial crisis. Over the weekend, the Bank of Japan's Haruhiko Kuroda was clear that he was 
watching the economic effect of the virus, adding that he was "well prepared" to act if needed.
This is a noble effort, and few doubt it would provide at least temporary relief to markets. But anyone who can 
clearly articulate how easier policy can fix an economic pullback based on deaths, grounded flights, closed factories 
and ghost cities is very welcome to get in touch.

An acceleration of cases in South Korea and Iran is also stirring fears that the virus is running out of control.
Italian stocks have led declines, dropping nearly 6 per cent www.yesterday.UK stocks fell nearly 4 per cent, with 
airlines feeling a heavy strain: easyJet sank 15 per cent, while Ryanair fell 12 per cent. Gold continued to rally hard, 
while oil prices were stumbling again.
The cavalry is expected in the form of central banks, which have stepped up repeatedly to counter scary drops in 
markets since the financial crisis. Over the weekend, the Bank of Japan's Haruhiko Kuroda was clear that he was 
watching the economic effect of the virus, adding that he was "well prepared" to act if needed.
This is a noble effort, and few doubt it would provide at least temporary relief to markets. But anyone who can 
clearly articulate how easier policy can fix an economic pullback based on deaths, grounded flights, closed factories 
and ghost cities is very welcome to get in touch.

Feb 25, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryder System 
R[1] have lost 19.3% compared with the industry[2]'s 0.6% decline in the past month. The stock underperformed the 
industry primarily due to weak used vehicle sales. Soft freight conditions have mainly lowered used vehicle 
sales.Let's take a look at the factors that are responsible for the dismal price performance.Ryder is plagued by 
below-par used vehicle sales thanks to low pricing and increased wholesaling activity. 
Weak freight conditions led to this downside. Moreover, bleak freight scenario is expected to persist at least until 
the second half of the year.Ryder expects revenues in the Dedicated Transportation Solutions segment to drop 1% 
in 2020 due to reduced sales activity and fewer large deals signed in the latter half of 2019.The downturn in the 
Supply Chain Solutions unit due to loss of business is another concern. Notably, revenues in the segment slid 3% in 
the fourth quarter of 2019. The adversity is anticipated to continue through the middle of 2020.Moreover, with Ryder 
investing substantially in its contractual lease fleet, capital expenditures are increasing, thereby hurting the bottom 
line. High debt levels further add to its woes.Negative Estimate Revisions ...ak Momentum ScoreThe negativity 
surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 
downward by 29.8% in the past 60 days to $1.77.The company's Momentum [3]Score of F further highlights its 
short-term unattractiveness.Additionally, Ryder carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome 
better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation [4]sector are Delta Air Lnes DAL[5], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] 
and Azul S.A. AZUL[7]. Delta carries a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy), while Ryanair and Azul sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].Shares of Delta , Ryanair 
and Azul have rallied more than 6%, 5% and 17%, respectively, in a year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast 
year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. 
Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of 
money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend

Feb 25, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of J.B.Hunt 
Transport Services, Inc. JBHT[1] have lost 2.4% against the industry's[2] 8.4% rise in a year's time. The 
unfavorable performance was caused by escalating operating expenses and disappointing performance in the truck 
segment.Let's take a look at the factors that are responsible for the dismal price performance.Acquisition-related 
costs and high operating expenses — including increased wages for drivers as well as rail purchased transportation 
costs are limiting bottom-line growth. 
Moreover, driver shortages are hurting the company's operations for quite some time. Notably, operating expenses 
increased 6.3% in 2019.Sluggish freight scenario is affecting volumes in the Truck segment. Truck revenues 
plunged 6.7% in 2019 due to lower loads and soft truck pricing. Consistent below-par performance in this unit will 
likely hurt the stock.Moreover, J.B. Hunt is a highly-leveraged company with its debt-to-equity ratio (expressed as a 
percentage) currently at 57.2 compared with the industry's 20.2. This implies that the company is funding most of its 
ventures with debt.Also, the company has a below- par track record with respect to earnings per share (EPS), 
having underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. The company reported 
better-than-expected EPS in the other quarter. The company has trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 
6.3%, on average.Negative Estimate Revisions and Weak Momentum ScoreThe negativity revolving around the 
stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings being revised downward by 6% in 
the past 60 days to $5.6.The company's Momentum[3] Score of D further highlights its short-term 
unattractiveness.Additionally, J.B.Hunt carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks 
in the transportation [4]sector are Delta Air Lines DAL[5], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] and Azul S.A AZUL[7]. Delta 
Airlines carries a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy), while Ryanair and Azul sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]Shares of Delta Air Lines , Ryanair and Azul 
have rallied more than 6%, 5% and 17%, respectively, in a year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it 
generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed 
investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for 
regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

European shares brace for worst day since 2016 as virus risks grow
European shares brace for worst day since 2016 as virus risks grow

A surge in coronavirus cases outside China wiped nearly $420 billion off the value of European stock markets on 
Monday, as investors sought the perceived safety of gold amid fears of a greater impact on global growth.
A 4.2% slump put Milan shares on course for their worst day since 2016, as Italy reported the biggest flare-up of the 
virus in Europe with four deaths and more than 150 infections.
The pan-European STOXX 600 dropped 3.4% and was on track for its biggest intra-day percentage slump since 
Britain voted to exit the European Union in June 2016.
London's main index was down 3%, with oil and travel stocks among the biggest decliners, even as the rate of 
infections in China dropped and the country relaxed restrictions on movement in several places including Beijing.
"The key debate is how much fear spills over into reality," said Chris Bailey, European equity strategist at Raymond 
James in London.
"China is starting to stabilize, but clearly now there are direct impacts on economies as well as the continuing 
supply chain impacts."
Airlines were among the worst performers on the STOXX 600, with EasyJet, Ryanair, Air France and Lufthansa 
down between 7.4% and 12.6%. Europe's travel & leisure index tumbled 5.4%.
Broad-based declines on the index sent luxury goods makers, miners, automakers, chipmakers and banking shares 
- which all tend to be tightly sensitive to expectations of global growth - down between 4% and 5%.
European shares brace for worst day since 2016 as virus risks grow
"Today makes it very clear that markets have been overly optimistic," said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market 
economist at Rabobank. "Chances have certainly increased that we might be on the brink of (a) reversal of (the) 
long term trend."
Both European and U.S. stock markets have been on a decade-long bull run since the financial crisis, and the 
benchmark European index was trading at record highs as recently as last Wednesday, confident that central banks 
would ease policy if need be to shield markets from the coronavirus fallout.
Stocks are down 5% since, putting them in negative territory for the year and bolstering expectations - already at 
50% - that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates by 10 basis points in July.
German shares, tightly linked to China by its export strength, were also down 3%, shrugging off an Ifo survey that 
showed business morale rose unexpectedly in February, easing recession fears in Europe's largest economy.
Primark-owner Associated British Foods slid 1.7% as it warned of potential supply shortages on some lines later in 
the 2019-20 financial year if delays in factory production in China are prolonged due to the outbreak.
Juventus slumped 9.3% after the Serie A leader posted a net loss of 50.3 million euros in the first half, compared to 
a profit a year earlier.
Bank of Ireland fell 4% after its underlying pretax profit fell for the fourth successive year and the lender added it 
would take longer than forecast to hit a return on tangible equity (ROTE) above 10%. (Reuters)

RYANAIR chief executive Michael O'Leary has been criticised for comments suggesting Muslim men should be 
screened at airports because "that is where the threat is coming from".
The airline boss told the Times that plane bombers are most likely to be single "males of a Muslim persuasion". He 
added that checks on families with young children should be less stringent as "the chances [they] are going to blow 
them all up is zero".
O'Leary's comments sparked widespread outrage across the Muslim community, with many brandishing his 
remarks as racist.
A spokeswoman for the Muslim Council of Britain said: "Michael O'Leary should be under no illusion: his comments 
are racist and discriminatory... He openly advocates discrimination against [anyone] who 'looks or acts like a 
Muslim.'" "This is the very definition of Islamophobia," they added.
Meanwhile, Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said O'Leary was "encouraging racism" with his comments.
"If he can tell me what colour Muslims are then I'd be very happy to learn from him - you can't judge a book by its 
cover," he told the Times.
In a statement released over the weekend, Ryanair peddled back on O'Leary's comments, saying: "He apologises 
sincerely for any offence."

Feb 24, 2020( Financial Press: https://financialpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  European stock markets tumbled 
sharply on Monday, with investors gripped by worry as coronavirus cases surged outside of China — in South 
Korea, Iran and Italy — over the weekend. The FTSE MIB Italy index  I945, -5.43%[1] nosedived 5.8% — its worst 
percentage decline since Aug. 24, 2015 — after coronavirus cases swept through the northern Lombardy region[2] 
over the weekend, which includes the financial capital, Milan. 
Officials put nearly a dozen towns on lockdown as the number of confirmed cases went from three on Friday to 
more than 150 by Monday, with three deaths. Venice reported its first two coronavirus cases, and shut its annual 
Carnival two days early. The U.S.-listed iShares MSCI Italy ETF  EWI, -5.01%[3] fell 5.7%. The losses weren't 
limited to Italy. The Stoxx Europe 600 index  SXXP, -3.79%[4] fell 4% and the national indexes of Germany  DAX, -
4.01%[5], the U.K.  UKX, -3.34%[6] and France  PX1, -3.94%[7] all fell sharply, as did U.S. stocks  SPX, -3.02%[8] 
Airline stocks hammeredThere were virtually no stocks in the green on Monday. Airline stocks were showing the 
biggest declines on Monday, with shares of easyJet PLC  EZJ, -16.67%[9] dropping 15% and Ryanair Holdings 
PLC  RY4C, -13.46%[10] down nearly 14%. Air France-KLM SA  AF, -8.68%[11] fell 10%. CTS Eventim  EVD, -
11.05%[12], an events group, fell 10%. The industrial sector also got hammered, with miner Anglo American  AAL, -
8.57%[13] , tractor maker CNH Industrial  CNHI, -7.65%[14] and steelmaker ArcelorMittal  MT, -6.72%[15] falling. 
South Korea reported 161 new cases on Monday, bringing the country's total to 763 cases, and two more deaths 
raising that toll to seven.  A lawmaker in Iran reported 50 deaths in Qom, though the country's health ministry said 
only 12 have died in the whole country. 'With further outbreaks likely to continue across the world, and Iraq and 
Turkey closing their borders to Iran after cases being reported there, financial markets could well have to get used 
to an extended period of uncertainty, as consumer behavior globally starts to change,' said Michael Hewson, chief 
market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note to clients.  'There is already evidence that this is happening, with 
Chinese tourist numbers down across the world, while the French finance minister said that tourist numbers in 
France were already down over 30% at this weekend's G20 finance ministers meeting,' he said.  On Saturday, the 
International Monetary Fund warned the virus outbreak could reduce global economic growth[16] by 0.1% this year, 
and drag China's annual growth 0.4 percentage points lower than January estimates.No more NutellaA tweet from 
a local supermarket showed empty shelves of Nutella. Italian soccer club Juventus  JUVE, -11.83%[17] was the 
worst performing FTSE MIB component after 3 Serie A matches were cancelled due to the spreading coronavirus. 
Europe Markets: Italian stocks slump nearly 6% as European equities crumble on spreading coronavirus
Fund manager Azimut Holding  AZM, -7.00%[18] and luxury products firm Salvatore Ferragamo  SFER, -8.90%[19] 
also nursed heavy losses. Assets that do well in crises advanced on Monday. Gold futures  GC00, +1.02%[20] 
surged some $19 an ounce, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury  TMUBMUSD10Y, -6.89%[21] fell 9basis points. 
The Swiss franc  CHFEUR, -0.1035%[22] rose against the euro to the highest level in nearly five years.The post

Feb 24, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Italy has 
reported a sharp rise in cases of coronavirus over the weekend. That has sent markets into frenzy, as the continent 
grapples with the prospect of a pandemic reaching its shores.A sharp increase in the number of confirmed 
coronavirus cases in Europe over the weekend, the vast majority of them in Italy, has prompted investor jitters in 
markets.The Italian stock exchange in Milan is down 4.3%, on course for its biggest one-day percentage loss since 
June 2016. Elsewhere in Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 has fallen 2.6%, Germany's DAX is down 3.3% and the Paris 
CAC has slipped back by 3.4%. The pan-European STOXX 600 has also fallen by more than 3%.The sell-off 
appears to have been prompted by the wave of new cases in Italy. There are now over 150 confirmed cases in the 
country, up from just three on Friday. 
Four people have died from the virus in the country."It would appear the coronavirus has finally caught up with the 
markets," Craig Erlam, an analyst with foreign exchange company OANDA told AFP."The deceleration in new 
Chinese cases gave investors a reason to buy the dip, but the spike outside of the country in the last few days 
supercedes that. Investors, in their determination not to miss a dip-buying opportunity, have been caught 
premature. This could sting," he said.Airlines take a big hitEuropean investors have rushed out of equities and into 
safe havens such as gold and US government bonds. The European sell-off mirrors similar firesales in Asian 
markets, sent into a frenzy by a surge in cases in South Korea.Airline stocks have taken a particular battering, with 
international transport an obvious casualty in the event of a global pandemic. European airlines EasyJet and 
Ryanair plunged by 12% and 10% respectively, while a host of others also tumbled.As well as travel, stocks in 
tourism and luxury concerns are also down sharply. Sectors reliant on China for their supply chains, in particular the 
car industry, also continue to lag badly.Many investors expect the fall to continue now that coronavirus fears appear 
to have moved beyond China and the Asia-Pacific region. "Markets [are] likely to show extreme caution in the face 
of [the] global spread of the coronavirus — this is no longer solely an Asia issue," Robert Carnell, chief Asia-Pacific 
economist at ING, told the Financial Times.Italian lockdownAway from the markets, the sharp rise in coronavirus 
cases is having a very real and practical impact on economic activity in Italy.The government there has imposed a 
strict quarantine across more than 10 towns in the northern region, where officials are trying to limit the spread of 
the biggest outbreak of the virus outside Asia.The Italian outbreak is centred around the regions of Lombardy and 
Veneto, where Venice and the Italian industrial and financial hub of Milan is located. Those two regions account for 
around one-third of Italy's entire economc activity. Many of the cases suddenly emerges in the small town of 
Codogno, 65 kilometers (40 miles) south-east of Milan.Schools and universities in the region have been closed 
while several major public events have been affected. Milan Fashion Week, the major clothing trade show, has 
Coronavirus European surge sends panic through markets
been disrupted while the Venice Carnival was cut short by two days on Sunday.Aside from the quarantined towns, 
travel into Italy has been hit. Austria, which shares a 404-kilometer (251-mile) border with Italy, is considering 
border controls.On Sunday night, Austria refused entry to a train coming from Italy after the Italian State Railways 
told the Austrian train operator OBB that two people on board had fever symptoms.All train traffic between the 
countries was briefly suspended but that was lifted within a few hours.In the wake of the developments in Italy, the 
European Commission has announced a €232 million ($251 million) aid package to help member states fight the 
outbreak.China still the centerWhile the outbreak in Italy has brought the coronavirus firmly onto European soil, the 
epicenter of the problem remains firmly in China, both in health and economic terms.There are now just under 
80,000 confirmed cases worldwide and of these, more than 77,000 are in China.Despite the new European fears, 
China has actually eased restrictions in several places, including in Beijing, as the rate of new infections fell 
back.Nonetheless, economic activity in China has been hit dramatically by the coronavirus outbreakand that had 
already been felt globally before the rise in new cases outside China over the weekend.China is the EU's second-
largest trade partner. with combined trade of €559 between the two in 2019. The EU Chamber of Commerce in 
China's President Jörg Wuttke has already spoken of the fact that foreign businesses' operations have been 
seriously disrupted in China that they may have to look elsewhere for supplies.He said that while the Chinese 
market is "always a lure, people have now woken up to the fact that you must have a backup plan."

Feb 23, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Michael O'Leary, CEO of the Irish 
budget carrier Ryanair, is facing criticism for suggesting Muslim men flying alone should be singled out as threat at 
airports. He explained in a recent interview that families with young children should not be subjected to airport 
security checks because there was zero chance of them being bombers, but added that terrorists 'will generally be 
males of a Muslim persuasion'. 'Thirty years ago it was the Irish. 
If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat', O'Leary said. His comments were widely condemned 
on social media, with activists demanding a Ryanair boycott. The Muslim Council of Britain called the comments 
'racist and discriminatory'. 'Why can someone like O'Leary spread Islamophobia like this today? Because he thinks 
people don't care. It's time to boycott Ryanair. Also for many other reasons', German Green party politician Ali Baş 
tweeted. 'In Germany this week a white person killed eight people. Should we profile white people to see if they're 
being fascists?', said the UK's politician Khalid Mahmood from the Labour party. The company later denied that 
O'Leary had called for Muslim men to face extra security checks before boarding a plane: 'Michael was only calling 
for more effective airport security checks which would do away with much of the unnecessary queues at airport 
security today for all passengers', a spokesman said. O'Leary has been known for his controversial comments 
before. Previously, he said most airport security was 'utterly useless', and complained that airlines unfairly got the 
blame for climate change. He also suggested that passengers should pay to use the toilet on his flights, said that 
requirements for Ryanair's Dublin offices to have disabled access to all floors were 'nonsense', and said that he 
may charge a 'fat tax' on obese people.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is facing criticism for suggesting Muslim men should be 
singled out for extra scrutiny at airports.
The boss of the Irish budget carrier told Saturday's Times of London that families with young children should not be 
subjected to airport security checks because there was "zero" chance of them being bombers. He said terrorists 
"will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion."
"Thirty years ago it was the Irish," he said. "If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat."
The Muslim Council of Britain called the comments "racist and discriminatory." Tell Mama, a charity that monitors 
hate incidents against Muslims, said O'Leary's "flippant" comments could harm Ryanair's business.
Labour Party lawmaker Khalid Mahmood said O'Leary was "being very blinkered and is actually encouraging 
racism."
O'Leary has a history of provocative remarks that keep Ryanair's name in the headlines.
In a wide-ranging interview with the Times, O'Leary branded most airport security "utterly useless," complained that 
airlines unfairly got the blame for climate change, and said requirements that Ryanair's Dublin offices have disabled 
access to all floors were "nonsense."

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said that Boeing aircraft will be the "safest, most checked planes" once the 
manufacturer overcomes its issues with its 737 MAX models following two deadly crashes.
Speaking to the British newspaper the Times, the Irish businessman criticized the United States manufacturer for 
doing a "seriously bad job of explaining their new planes," but also cast a vote of confidence in the company's new 
aircraft.
"People will love the plane when it's back, but we have a customer confidence issue," the budget airline boss told 
the Times in the interview published on Saturday.
"We will deal with that by hopefully having lower fares onboard the plane while trying it out.
"And if someone decides they don't want to fly for a period of time we will say, 'Fine, you can offload yourself and 
we will refund you.' That's how much confidence we have in the plane," the famously refund-averse O'Leary said.
The Irish budget airline did not cancel a contract with Boeing to order up to 210 of its 737s, including MAX models, 
despite the US company's grounding of the 737 MAX series last March after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia 
killed 346 people.
The primary cause of the crashes in October 2018 and March 2019 is thought to be a fault in the flight control 
software, which Boeing had wanted to fix with an update more than a year ago.
In the most recent setback for Boeing, whose grounded 737 MAX airliners created a backlog in orders, foreign 
object debris was found in fuel tanks of some of the aircraft during maintenance work, the aviation giant said on 
Tuesday.

Michael O'Leary is drawing criticism for stating that single, Muslim men are the largest terror threat to airlines and 
that they should be profiled at airports."Who are the bombers? They are going to be single males travelling on their 
own. 
If you are travelling with a family of kids, on you go; the chances you are going to blow them all up is zero,' O'Leary 
told the Sunday Times on Saturday. [1]"You can't say stuff, because it's racism, but it will generally be males of a

threat."Leaders in the U.K.'s Muslim community swiftly condemned O'Leary's comments."In Germany this week a 
white person killed eight people. Should we profile white people to see if they're being fascists?" British Labour 
politician Khalid Mahmoud said in response to O'Leary's comments. Nine people were killed in a far-right attack in 
the German town of Hanau this week, which targeted victims of immigrant backgrounds.The Muslim Council of 
Britain called O'Leary's remarks "racist and discriminatory.'Some Twitter users called for a boycott of Ryanair. 'Why 
can someone like O'Leary spread Islamophobia like this today? Because he thinks people don't care,' German 
politician Ali Bas tweeted. 'It's time to boycott #Ryanair. Also for many other reasons.'Others drew historical 
parallels between O'Leary's comments and how the English dealt with Irish terrorismduring the Troubles.[2]'Irish 
@Ryanair founder says Muslim men traveling alone should be singled out for extra security as most likely to be 
terrorists,' Stockholm University Professor Christian Christensen said. 'Pretty rich, given English used same logic -- 
all Irish/Catholics are potential terrorists -- to discriminate against and harass Irish for decades.'O'Leary has made 
controversial comments in the past. Hehas called concerns [3]about climate change 'complete and utter rubbish'

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called for profiling of Muslim men at airports because "that is where the 
threat is coming from," in an interview with the Times newspaper.
The budget airline boss told the British newspaper that checks for families should be less stringent, while calling for 
the focus to shift to Muslim men travelling on their own.
"Who are the bombers? They are going to be single males travelling on their own," the Irishman said in comments 
published on Saturday.
"If you are travelling with a family of kids, on you go; the chances you are going to blow them all up is fucking zero.
"You can't say stuff, because it's racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion. Thirty years ago it 
was the Irish," the 58-year-old said. "If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat."
British Labour parliamentarian Khalid Mahmood said the Ryanair boss was "encouraging racism."
"In Germany this week a white person killed eight people. Should we profile white people to see if they're being 
fascists?" the Times cited Mahmood as saying. "He's being very blinkered and is actually encouraging racism."
The Muslim Council of Britain called the comments "racist and discriminatory." A spokeswoman said it was a 
scandal that such racism was expressed "so openly and brazenly."
Scotland's Justice Minister, Humza Yousaf, condemned the comments on Twitter, writing, "awful from Michael 
O'Leary suggesting racial profiling to be introduced at airports."
Outrage as Ryanair boss calls for extra security checks on Muslim men
Nasir Ahmad, a German muslim blogger pointed out that O'Leary's remarks came shortly after a stabbing attack at 
London Central Mosque on Thursday, and a right-wing mass shooting in Hanau targetting Muslims and people of 
foreign descent.
O'Leary is famous for his controversial statements. He once called for a fat-tax on overweight passengers and 
famously considered a "pay-per-pee" plan on board Ryanair flights, though the Irish airline never carried out the 
plans.

Feb 22, 2020( The Geller Report: https://gellerreport.com Delivered by Newstex) ; Ryanair chief Michael told the 
Times that potential terrorists will 'generally be males of a Muslim persuasion' - and that families with young children 
should be waved through airport security as there was 'virtually' no chance of them being terrorists. First, Islam is 
not a race. Second, this is absolutely true. 
'in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.' And yes, airport security should focus on 'where 
the threat is coming from'. Michael O'Leary in an interview also appeared to mock obese passengers, and hit out at 
the need to accommodate disabled people. By: Sky News[1], February 22, 2020 Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has 
sparked outrage for suggesting would-be plane bombers are more likely to be Muslim men - and airport security 
should focus on 'where the threat is coming from'.He told The Times that potential terrorists will 'generally be males 
of a Muslim persuasion' - and that families with young children should be waved through airport security as there 
was 'virtually' no chance of them being terrorists.Ryanair has disputed the paper's coverage and said its chief 
executive 'apologises sincerely for any offence caused', having been accused of sharing 'racist and discriminatory' 
views. Ryanair adverts have been banned after they were judged to be misleading Image: Ryanair is one of the 
biggest airlines in Europe The 58-year-old told the newspaper: 'Who are the bombers? They are going to be single 
males travelling on their own. 'If you are travelling with a family of kids, on you go; the chances you are going to 
blow them all up is zero.' He added: 'You can't say stuff, because it's racism, but it will generally be males of a 
Muslim persuasion. Thirty years ago it was the Irish. 'If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat.' 
Ryanair told Sky News that any suggestion that Mr O'Leary thought Muslim men should face extra airport security 
checks were 'simply inaccurate'. 'Michael was only calling for more effective airport security checks which would do 
away with much of the unnecessary queues at airport security today for all passengers,' a spokesman said. The 
controversial comments came during an interview in which he also appeared to mock obese passengers - and hit 
out at the need to accommodate disabled people. Hate crime monitoring group Tell Mama said his 'flippant' 
comments could have serious consequences for the business where he was worked for more than 30 years. 
'Besides being discriminatory and basing judgements on the 'looks' of people, which is abhorrent, O'Leary clearly 
does not know about the history of terrorism, where people have used others to bypass this blunt and divisive 
technique,' it said. The Muslim Council of Britain also criticised Mr O'Leary, describing his views as 'the very 
definition of Islamophobia'. 'He openly advocates discrimination against 'males of a Muslim persuasion', which 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary accused of 'racism' for saying terrorists are 'generally Muslim men'
presumably is not based on specific intelligence but solely whether someone 'looks or acts like a Muslim',' a 
spokeswoman said. 'It is a shame that such racism is being expressed so openly, and that the CEO of a large 
airline would so want to discriminate against his customers so brazenly.' Mr O'Leary is no stranger to courting 
controversy, having famously proposed that passengers should pay to use the toilet, and he dressed up as a pope 
to launch Ryanair's new route from Dublin to Rome. He has also been at loggerheads with the UK government in 
recent times - threatening legal action over its bailout of regional carrier Flybe, and criticising former transport 
secretary Chris Grayling over no-deal Brexit planning. Last year he also waded into the row over a McDonald's 
executive who was sacked for having a consensual relationship with an employee. The Truth Must be Told Your

Feb 22, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Peter 
Nicholls/File Photo Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is facing criticism after calling on airports to profile Muslim men 
traveling alone. In an interview with The Times[1], O'Leary said that "males of a Muslim persuasion" who are 
traveling alone are more likely to be "bombers" and pose a higher risk to airlines than other passengers. O'Leary 
faced criticism from hate crime monitoring groups and a Labour MP who accused him of stoking racism and 
Islamophobia. Ryanair told Sky News[2] that O'Leary's statements were "simply inaccurate." 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. The CEO of one of the world's largest airlines is facing 
criticism after saying Muslim men should be profiled at airports. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, 58, made the 
comment during an interview with The Times[4], saying that "males of a Muslim persuasion" who are traveling alone 
are more likely to be "bombers" and pose a higher risk to airlines than other passengers. He went on to say that 
profiling of Muslim families doesn't have to be as strict because "the chances [they] are going to blow them all up is 
zero." "You can't say stuff, because it's racism," O'Leary, who's held Ryanair's CEO position since 1994, told The 
Times. "Thirty years ago, it was the Irish. If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat." O'Leary, 
one of the wealthiest men in Ireland, faced criticism from hate crime monitoring groups and Labour MP Khalid 
Mahmood, who accused the airline CEO of Islamophobia in a comment to Sky News. The Muslim Council of Britain 
told the Guardian:[5] "This is the very definition of Islamophobia. Institutional discrimination against Muslims is well-
established: whether it is the ability to get a job, buy a flat or even getting car insurance. The challenges of flying 
while Muslim are well documented across the globe. Ryanair told Sky News[6] that O'Leary's statements were 
"simply inaccurate." "Michael was only calling for more effective airport security checks which would do away with 
much of the unnecessary queues at airport security today for all passengers," a spokesman said. O'Leary's 
interview with the Times included a number of disparaging comments, including calling the need for wheelchair 
facilities on every floor of a Dublin office building "complete and utter nonsense." He made fun of transgender rights 
and the need for gender-neutral bathrooms; and called obese passengers "monsters" who should consider buying 
two seats. Read more: I flew on the 'world's worst short-haul airline,' Ryanair, and it was so comfortable and stress-

Feb 22, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In this Sept. 12, 2018 file photo, a 
Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany. Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said Monday Feb. 
3, 2020, that the grounding of the new Boeing Max jets will delay its growth targets. The budget carrier, which is 
based in Ireland and carries more passengers than any other airline in Europe, plans to extend by a year or two its 
target of flying 200 million people per year. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)LONDON (AP) — Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary is facing criticism for suggesting Muslim men should be singled out for extra scrutiny at 
airports.  The boss of the Irish budget carrier told Saturday's Times of London that families with young children 
should not be subjected to airport security checks because there was 'zero' chance of them being bombers. He said 
terrorists "will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion." 'Thirty years ago it was the Irish,' he said. 'If that is 
where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat."  The Muslim Council of Britain called the comments 'racist 
and discriminatory.' Tell Mama, a charity that monitors hate incidents against Muslims, said O'Leary's 'flippant' 
comments could harm Ryanair's business. Labour Party lawmaker Khalid Mahmood said O'Leary was 'being very 
blinkered and is actually encouraging racism."  O'Leary has a history of provocative remarks that keep Ryanair's 
name in the headlines. In a wide-ranging interview with the Times, O'Leary branded most airport security 'utterly 
useless,' complained that airlines unfairly got the blame for climate change, and said requirements that Ryanair's 
Dublin offices have disabled access to all floors were 'nonsense.'

threat is coming from." He said he believes terrorists are "generally Muslims."Budget airline Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary called for the profiling of "males of a Muslim persuasion" at airports to prevent terrorism, in an 
interview on Saturday with British newspaper The Times."That is where the threat is coming from," he said.He 
suggested that checks on families should be less stringent while Muslim men flying alone should be targeted by 
airport security."Who are the bombers?
 They are going to be single males traveling on their own," the Irishman said in Saturday's interview."If you are 
traveling with a family of kids, on you go; the chances you are going to blow them all up is zero," he added."You 
can't say stuff, because it's racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion. Thirty years ago it was the 
Irish," O'Leary said.Read more: Easyjet, Thomas Cook and Ryanair — Brexit's effect on tourism's big namesBritish

see if they're being fascists?" Mahmood told The Times.The Ryanair boss, an airline that operates mainly in 
Europe, has previously caused controversy by suggesting that passengers should have to pay to use the toilet on 
his flights and that he may charge a "fat tax" on obese people.Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a

RYANAIR yesterday said passengers will be able to double their voluntary carbon offset contribution from (EURO)1 
(84p) to (EURO)2 from April onwards.
The increase, which the airline admitted was "modest", is part of the low-budget carrier's ongoing sustainability 
campaign.
Three per cent of Ryanair's passengers currently participate in the voluntary scheme, the funds from which are 
used for projects including reforestation in the Monchique region of Southern Portugal, which was devastated by 
forest fires in 2018.
The carrier is also investing over $20bn (£15.5bn) in new aircraft technology that will carry four per cent more 
passengers, but with 16 per cent lower fuel consumption and 40 per cent lower noise emissions.
Ryanair recently fell foul of the UK's advertising watchdog over emissions claims in one of its ads.
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that Ryanair wrongly claimed it was Europe's low emission airline. 
The airline justified its figures by stating the young age and efficiency of its fleet in addition to offering a large 
number of direct flights.
The ASA also ruled that Ryanair's comparison with its rivals could not be considered an accurate measure.

 The European Commission said it opened an in-depth investigation to assess whether marketing agreements 
concluded by Spanish public authorities via certain public entities with Irish budget airline Ryanair and a number of 
other airlines using Girona-Costa Brava and Reus airports in Catalonia are in line with EU State aid rules.
The Commission opened an investigation in 2013 following a complaint from an airline about marketing agreements 
related to Ryanair's operations at the nearby Girona and Reus airports, alleging that the agreements amounted to 
illegal state aid in favor of Ryanair. 
Spain confirmed the existence of additional marketing agreements. The Commission said it takes the preliminary 
view that the marketing support granted to Ryanair and other airlines by the Spanish public authorities through the 
marketing contracts may constitute State aid.
The Commission will investigate further to determine whether or not its initial view is confirmed and will provide all 
interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the measures.

Ryanair says it has no interest in buying Air Italy

Ryanair's chief commercial officer on Thursday denied any interest in buying Air Italy after press reports linking his 
group to the loss-making airline, which was put into liquidation by its owners earlier this week.
Air Italy's owners Qatar Airways and regional carrier Alisarda blamed "persistent and structural market problems" 
for the decision to pull the plug on Tuesday.
Asked about Italian press reports that Ryanair was preparing an offer, chief commercial officer David O'Brien said 
his group was not interested and had not been approached.
"Let's clear the room ... We have no interest whatsoever in buying Air Italy. It would be pointless," he told reporters 
at an event in Milan.
He added Ryanair did not see "any value" in Air Italy and that its only interesting slots would be those at Milan's 
Linate airport, but these would be too expensive.
Qatar Airways bought a 49% stake in loss making Air Italy in 2017 and rebranded it, pushing for the carrier to add 
more long-haul flights to its popular domestic routes - mainly to and from the island of Sardinia.
Regional carrier Alisarda, controlled by the Aga Khan, owns the remaining 51%.
State-owned Qatar airlines said on Tuesday it was ready to invest further in Air Italy, but under current rules foreign 
investors cannot own more than 49% of a European airline.
Ryanair says it has no interest in buying Air Italy
Despite an increase in sales, estimated at 330 million euros in 2019, Air Italy expected 230 million euros in losses 
for the same period, a statement by Alisarda said.
Two commissioners have been appointed to carry out the liquidation process of Air Italy, which has 13 leased 
planes and just under 1,500 workers. Under the procedure, the airline will pay back its debts in full. (Reuters)

Just Eat www.Takeaway.com rose after JPMorgan Cazenove turned positive on the newly merged food delivery       
     www.group.UK rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats had been affected over the past five months by lower delivery 
ratios in London and growth slowing outside the capital, JPMorgan said.
With the economics of UK delivery better than perceived, Just Eat's local growth should accelerate strongly in the 
second half, the broker argued.
Tui led travel stocks higher after a stronger than expected trading update, which helped buoy easyJet and Ryanair.
NMC Health retreated after buyout group KKR said it had no intention of bidding, having been named by the 
hospital operator on Monday as a potential predator.
Boohoo, the online retailer, climbed after a Barclays upgrade.
The risk of Boohoo's core brands slowing in the UK has been exaggerated, and "abnormally high" returns look 
sustainable, it said.

Feb 12, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Copa Holdings, S.A. 
CPA[1] reported below par traffic numbers for January 2020. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger 
miles (RPMs), slipped 5.7% to 1.82 billion in the month. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity 
(measured in available seat miles/ASMs) dropped 7% year over year to 2.16 billion.The downside was caused by 
reduced capacity due to the extended grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jets. The carrier with six Boeing MAX 9 
jets in its fleet removed all MAX flights from its schedule through March 2020[2]. Consequently, multiple fight 
cancellations are affecting revenues. The company's fourth-quarter performance is likely to get impacted by this 
drab scenario.Meanwhile, with traffic declining less than the amount of capacity contraction, load factor (% of seats 
filled by passengers) increased 120 basis points to 84.2% in January.Copa Holdings, S.A. Price

RYANAIR chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, who spearheaded the airline's drive to improve customer service, 
is to leave his position after six years at the end of April to pursue other challenges, he told Reuters yesterday.
Jacobs, who joined Ryanair at the start of 2014, was the architect of the airline's Always Getting Better drive to 
improve customer service and was charged with overhauling the company's web site to adapt to individual 
customer preferences.
"I will enjoy a summer off with family and then look for my next challenge," Jacobs said.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said in an emailed statement that Ryanair's digital presence and customer service 
had been transformed under Jacobs over the past six years.
Over the period, Ryanair has boosted the proportion of its revenue earned from optional extras such as assigned 
seating and additional baggage from just over 20 per cent to just over 30 per cent.
Jacobs' exit comes a month after Ryanair's chief operating officer Peter Bellew joined rival Easyjet after a court 
case that found his 12-month non-compete clause was unenforceable.
Ryanair is shifting to a group structure, appointing executives to lead smaller subsidiaries. Reuters

released strong traffic numbers for January, highlighting solid demand for its services. Consolidated traffic 
(measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 29.1% year over year to 3.32 billion owing to 28.3% 
growth on the domestic front and a 31.5% rise internationally. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or 
available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 26.5% to 3.9 billion, driven by 25.2% and 30.5% increase in domestic 
and international capacity, respectively.With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of 
seats filled by passengers) improved a commendable 170 basis points (bps). While domestic load factor jumped 
200 bps, international load factor climbed 70 bps.Owing to solid air travel demand, the company has been 
witnessing robust rise in passenger revenues. 
Notably, passenger revenues, accounting for more than 90% of the top line, augmented 23.4% during the first nine 
months of 2019. The uptrend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well, aiding the company's overall 
results in turn. Detailed report will be available on Mar 12.Shares of Azul have rallied 32.9% in a year's time against 
the industry's 0.2% decline, primarily owing to the uptick in passenger revenues. The company's fleet modernization 
efforts to replace older generation aircraft with larger, more fuel-efficient planes also boosted performance.Zacks

Feb 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Investors looking for 
stocks in the Transportation - Airline sector might want to consider either Delta Air Lines (DAL) or Ryanair (RYAAY). 
But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a 
closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an 
impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. 
The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores 
work to identify stocks with specific traits.Both Delta Air Lines and Ryanair have a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) 
right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so 
investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part 
of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to 
help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value 
grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash 
flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.DAL currently has a 
forward P/E ratio of 7.93, while RYAAY has a forward P/E of 17.92. We also note that DAL has a PEG ratio of 0.57. 
This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes 
into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. RYAAY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.12.Another 
notable valuation metric for DAL is its P/B ratio of 2.43. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value 
versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, RYAAY has a P/B of 
2.97.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DAL's Value grade of A and RYAAY's Value grade of D.Both 
DAL and RYAAY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel 
that DAL is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Green Party could be kingmaker in election
Green Party could be kingmaker in election

Ireland's Green Party, likely to be a kingmaker after Saturday's election, would re-introduce an aviation tax opposed 
by Ryanair and push two megaprojects to cut carbon emissions if it enters government, leader Eamon Ryan said in 
an interview this week.
While recent opinion polls show the Green Party in fourth place with around 8% support, the country's two dominant 
parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, have consistently named the Greens as a preferred partner. Analysts say most 
possible governments would seek the Greens' support.
Support for the party collapsed in 2011 after a disastrous four-year stint in coalition with center-right Fianna Fail, 
which saw the Irish economy collapse after a property bubble burst. But support has bounced back amid a political 
"green wave" across Europe.
"We have four other green parties in government across Europe, I am hoping we can make it a fifth," Ryan told 
Reuters in the interview on Wednesday, adding he was targeting around 10% of the 160 seats in parliament.
Ryan said he was open to being in a coalition with any party and said the key aim would be to increase planned 
cuts to carbon dioxide emissions to 7% per year from 2% per year. Anything less "won't work," he added.
One of the most achievable goals would be the re-introduction of an air passenger travel tax, scrapped in 2011, that 
charged 10 euros for each passenger flying to an airport more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) from Dublin, he said.
"I don't see that as a particularly difficult negotiation," he said, adding he was confident it would be secured in any 
coalition talks. "It's not a huge (thing), it's a 10 euro a ticket tax. ... It signals intent."
Green Party could be kingmaker in election
Persuading partners to end the construction of major new motorways on the island, on the other hand, would be a 
"real challenge."
The greens would pursue two megaprojects, he said: huge floating wind farms off the Irish coast and the "re-
wetting" of the country's bogs, which cover 16% of its land.
The latter involves blocking drains of dried-out bog land to restore the water level up to the vegetation level, 
creating a huge carbon sink.
"We think could save something like 10 million tonnes of carbon a year. So that is big," he said of the bog project. 
Current emissions are around 60 million tonnes.
The offshore boom would have two phases - first 5 gigawatts of wind capacity added in the Irish Sea in the 2020s

THE UK's advertising watchdog has decided that an advert from Ryanair about its carbon emissions was 
misleading.
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) yesterday ruled that a series of press, TV and radio adverts, released in 
September 2019, wrongly claimed that Ryanair is "Europe's low emission airline".
In its ruling, the ASA said: "We did not consider consumers would understand it to mean that the CO2 emissions 
associated with their journey could be considered 'low' in absolute terms."
The ASA also ruled that Ryanair's comparison with its competitors could not be considered an accurate measure 
for consumers.
Ryanair justified its figures by stating the young age and efficiency of its fleet in addition to offering a large number 
of direct flights.
However, the ruling means Ryanair can no longer use the advert.
In a statement, the airline said: "Ryanair is delighted with its latest environmental advertising campaign, which 
communicates a hugely important message for our customers."
It added:"The single most important thing any consumer can do to halve their carbon footprint is switch to Ryanair."
It comes after the UK's aviation industry on Tuesday made a pledge to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Ryanair is putting a new slant on flygskam or flight shame. This week the Advertising Standards Authority hung the 
Dublin group's greenwashing out to dry. It objected to Ryanair ads claiming it had the lowest carbon emissions of 
any major airline. One objection was Ryanair had not made clear it crams more people on its planes. Who knew? It 
is hard to imagine any gas-guzzling airline proclaiming its green credentials and customers believing them. And 
how much do passengers really care? Only about 2 per cent of customers have made donations, totalling about 
(EURO)2.5m, to Ryanair's voluntary carbon offset programme.

Ryanair ordered to drop low-emissions ad claims
Ryanair ordered to drop low-emissions ad claims

Budget carrier Ryanair was ordered on Wednesday to withdraw publicity describing it as a "low-CO2 emissions 
airline", as Britain's main advertising watchdog labelled the claim misleading.
Ryanair Holdings Plc's print and broadcast adverts last September made environmental claims that were poorly 
substantiated and "must not appear again in their current forms", the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled.
Under Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, the carrier has tangled repeatedly with advertising authorities, often over 
discount terms and conditions, and on Wednesday struck an unabashed tone.
"Ryanair is delighted with its latest environmental advertising campaign, which communicates a hugely important 
message for our customers," spokeswoman Alejandra Ruiz said.
Under pressure from policymakers and "flight-shaming" campaigners, airlines are scrambling to convince 
consumers they are taking action to mitigate environmental impacts, even as their traffic grows.
Low-cost carriers tend to emit less carbon dioxide per passenger than legacy airlines because they operate 
younger aircraft on point-to-point routes with fewer empty seats. But they also account for a bigger share of total 
emissions growth.
Ryanair, which carried 152 million passengers in 2019 and is targeting 200 million by mid-decade, based its green 
message on emissions per passenger, per kilometre. Its 69 grammes of CO2 per passenger-km come in 23% 
below the average of Lufthansa , British Airways parent IAG, Air France-KLM and easyJet, its website says.
Ryanair ordered to drop low-emissions ad claims
In absolute terms, Ryanair's 9.9 million tonnes of CO2 output placed it among Europe's top 10 emitters in 2018, a 
group dominated by coal-fired power stations, according to EU data.
In radio and television adverts, the company "did not give any information on the metric used" to underpin its self-
description as a "low-CO2 emissions airline", the ASA found.
The print version did outline the calculation but failed to acknowledge Ryanair's higher seating density as a 
contributor or substantiate a claim to be Europe's "lowest-emissions airline", the watchdog ruled, upholding 
complaints against all three ads.
"We told Ryanair to ensure that when making environmental claims, they held adequate evidence to substantiate 
them and ... that the basis of those claims were made clear," it said.
Transport & Environment, a European campaign group, said the decision offered "a reminder that the aviation 
sector's climate impact is soaring because of a decades-long tax holiday and almost zero regulation of their 
pollution."
A spokeswoman for the environmental organisation added: "Ryanair should stop greenwashing and start doing 
something to tackle its sky-high emissions."
Ryanair said the same advertising message had been used in 10 European countries. "The message was approved 
in other markets and we provided all the supporting data they required," Ruiz said. (Reuters)

Feb 05, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A British 
regulator on Wednesday banned advertisements by Ryanair that gave "misleading" claims over the Irish airline's 
"low" level of carbon emissions -- a move welcomed by environmental campaigners.The Advertising Standards 
Authority (ASA) ruled that the no-frills airline's September radio, television and print advertisements broke the UK 
regulator's rules on environmental claims and on misleading consumers.Ryanair boasted that it "has the lowest 
carbon emissions of any major airline".ASA said it had called on Ryanair "to ensure that when making 
environmental claims, they held adequate evidence to substantiate them and to ensure that the basis of those 
claims were made clear".In reaction, Ryanair said it was "disappointed and surprised" and maintained that it is the 
"greenest" airline in Europe -- adding that it had successfully run the same advertisement in ten European 
nations.Environmental pressure group Transport & Environment slammed Ryanair for so-called greenwashing -- a 
term used by critics to describe corporate efforts to mislead consumers to believe a company's products or 
practices are more environmentally sound or friendly. Ryanair maintains it is the "greenest" airline in Europe Photo: 
AFP / Olivier MORIN  "Ryanair should stop greenwashing and start doing something to tackle its sky-high 
emissions," said the campaign group's aviation manager Jo Dardenne. 
"This ruling is a reminder that the aviation sector's climate impact is soaring."Rory Boland, editor of consumer 
magazine Which? Travel, said its own probe had also uncovered doubts over Ryanair's carbon offsetting 
scheme."Millions of travellers want to make greener choices when they go on holiday, so the regulator is right to 
crack down on companies that make this more difficult with misleading information," he said.Wednesday's ban 
came one day after the Sustainable Aviation industry alliance -- which does not include Ryanair -- vowed to slash 
carbon emissions to zero over the next 30 years, in line with UK government targets.The alliance includes 
planemakers Airbus and Boeing, engine-maker Rolls-Royce, London's Heathrow airport and airlines BA and 
EasyJet.

 Shares of Ryanair (RYA.L) were up Wednesday although the UK's Advertising Standards Authority banned certain 
ads of the low-cost airline, stating that they were misleading consumers in regards to environmental claims. 
The airline ran a series of ads in September 2019, billing itself as Europe's "lowest emissions airline" and a "low 
CO2 emissions airline". In response, several complainants said the ads could not be substantiated. 
The ad watchdog said the ads must not appear again in their current forms and that Ryanair will have to ensure that 
environmental claims can be substantiated by adequate evidence.

I agree with Professor Ira Sohn (Letters, February 3) regarding the possibility of relegating the 737 Max to the role 
of cargo carrier. This is what happened after the DC10/MD11 was involved in several serious accidents.
However, the Max disasters are more serious in that many UK airports are basing their expansion plans on the new 
breed of twin-engined single-aisle aircraft such as the Boeing Max and Airbus 320/321 neo, LR and XLR series. 
Liverpool John Lennon airport (LJLA) is an example of such an expansion plan, together with an extended runway 
proposal. Ryanair, a principal LJLA carrier, has ordered 135 Max 200s - a 197-seat variation of the Max 8 - and 
clearly cannot utilise the 737-800s ad infinitum.
Apart from drastic revisions of master plans, airports such as LJLA will have to appreciate that residents within take-
off or approach paths will not be happy with the Max operating from their airports, irrespective of cargo or 
passenger loads.

Feb 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  To allay fears due to the 
rapidly-spreading coronavirus, major U.S. carriers — Delta Air Lines DAL[1], United Airlines UAL[2] and American 
Airlines AAL[3] — have suspended all flights to China. Notably, the coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China.On the 
earnings front, Alaska Air Group ALK[4] and Hawaiian Holdings HA[5] reported better-than-expected earnings per 
share for fourth-quarter 2019. However, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[6] lagged earnings estimates. Apart from 
releasing fourth-quarter results, Alaska Air Group announced a 7.1% hike in quarterly dividend to 37.5 cents per 
share.Additionally, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[7] reported impressive results for the third 
quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended Dec 31, 2019) backed by robust traffic in Christmas/New year.(Read the Last Airline 
Stock Rounduphere[8]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Alaska Air Group's fourth-quarter 2019 
earnings per share of $1.46 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Moreover, the bottom line surged 
94.7% year over year on low fuel costs. 
Revenues came in at $2,228 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,220.5 million.The top line 
also increased approximately 8% year over year. Passenger revenues — contributing 92.3% to the top line — were 
up 8% on a year-over-year basis. (Read more: Alaska Air Group Beats on Q4 Earnings, Hikes Dividend[9]).Alaska 
Air Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[10].2. Hawaiian Holdings' fourth-quarter earnings (excluding 8 cents from non-recurring items) of 
99 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. However, the bottom line edged down 1% 
year over year. Although quarterly revenues of $708.1 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $709.3 
million, the figure inched up 1.5% year over year.Meanwhile, operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a 
key measure of unit revenues) in the quarter slid 2.1% year over year. Average fuel cost per gallon decreased 6.8% 
to $2.05 in the December-end quarter. RASM is expected to decline 4.5-7.5% in the March-end quarter. (Read 
more: Hawaiian Holdings Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Slip Y/Y[11]).3. Allegiant's fourth-quarter 2019 earnings of 
$3.72 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.87. However, the bottom line surged 45.3% year 
over year, driven by lower fuel costs and higher revenues. Total operating revenues increased 11.9% year over 
year to $461.1 million on the back of a 10.8% rise in passenger revenues.Moreover, the top line surpassed the 
consensus mark of $460.2 million. The company still expects earnings per share between $16.5 and $19 for 2020.

the December-end quarter. The carrier still expects fiscal 2020 profit after tax in the €0.95-€1.05 billion range. Fiscal 
2020 revenue per guest is expected to be up 3-4%. Fuel bill for fiscal 2020 is anticipated to rise €440 million from 
the fiscal 2019 levels. Non-fuel unit costs are projected to rise by roughly 2%.Meanwhile, Ryanair's January traffic 
report was impressive, with the metric (including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit) increasing 5% year over year 
to 10.8 million. Additionally, the load factor increased to 92% from 91% a year ago. Ryanair operated more than 
62,000 scheduled flights in January.5. In response to the coronavirus outbreak — Delta, United Airlines and 
American Airlines — suspended all flights to and from China. In fact, the State Department issued an advisory 
asking Americans not to travel to the country. Delta, United Airlines and American Airlines have reportedly[13] 
suspended service to mainland China from Feb 6 through Apr 30, Mar 28 and Mar 27, 2020, respectively. 
Additionally, due to weaker-than-expected demand following the coronavirus outbreak and also political unrest, 
American Airlines suspended flights to Hong Kong through Feb 20.Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months.What's Next in the Airline 
Space?Investors keenly await January traffic reports from multiple carriers. Further, corona virus-related updates 
and the resultant impact on air travel will be awaited by investors.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe

expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most 
as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s.

Max jet delays hit Ryanair 's customer growth target Airlines
Max jet delays hit Ryanair's customer growth target; Airlines
Financial Times (London, England)

Body
Ryanair has warned of further disruption from delayed deliveries of Boeing 737 Max jets, saying it would not receive 
its order in time for the peak summer season, pushing back its customer growth targets by up to two years.
Regulators grounded the Max after two fatal crashes and Boeing is still struggling to win approval for its return to 
service. The Max is seen as a gamechanger for airlines as it carries 4 per cent more passengers and uses 16 per 
cent less fuel.
Ryanair has repeatedly extended its Max delivery timetable. At its quarterly results yesterday, it said it would not 
receive the first planes until September or October and that it would not start to benefit from cost savings until late 
in 2021. In a previous update, the airline said it expected to receive only 10 planes for the summer of 2020, down 
from an earlier figure of 20.
The Dublin-based airline has also extended by "at least one or two years" - until 2025 or 2026 - its target to carry 
200m passengers, prompting analysts to observe that it will be harder for Ryanair to achieve its target for 
(EURO)2bn in annual operating profits. "Moving that goalpost makes that (EURO)2bn even harder to achieve if at 
all," said Daniel Roeska, senior analyst at Bernstein Research.
Mr Roeska added that Ryanair changing its growth targets could benefit the rest of the industry. "If Ryanair isn't 
growing that quickly, that means less capacity in the market and everybody can [charge higher] fares."
Max jet delays hit Ryanair 's customer growth target Airlines
The latest Max delays were expected and could be "a blessing in disguise" for the airline, Mr Roeska said. "If 
Ryanair was receiving the planes right now, capacity growth would be higher and fares would be lower."
Micheal O'Leary, chief executive, said the delivery schedule had been delayed by 12 months and Boeing expected 
approval to resume flights in June. "We had hoped to have 55 aircraft in the fleet for the summer of 2020. We'll 
have none," he said.
"What that means for us is obviously much slower growth in 2021. We expect very modest growth through the 
summer of 2020."
Mr O'Leary also said he expected no long-term impact from coronavirus, saying Ryanair's experience with Sars and 
with avian flu was that they were "mildly good" for European short haul travel. "More people were likely to holiday in 
Europe rather than travelling long haul to Asia ... and we think that will play out again. But we should be wary on the 
short-term impact."
Ryanair shares rose 6 per cent in London after the results were published. The group had upgraded its full-year 
forecast in January - predicting pre-tax profits of between (EURO)950m and (EURO)1.05bn, compared with an 
earlier range of (EURO)800m to (EURO)900m. Net profit in the three months to December was (EURO)88m, 
against a (EURO)66m loss in the same period one year earlier.
On UK-EU trade after Brexit, Mr O'Leary said the mood music was negative but dismissed "tough talk" from

Ryanair has warned of further disruption from delayed deliveries of Boeing 737 Max jets, saying it would not receive 
its order in time for the peak summer season, pushing back its customer growth targets by up to two years.
Regulators grounded the Max after two fatal crashes and Boeing is still struggling to win approval for its return to 
service. The Max is seen as a gamechanger for airlines because it carries 4 per cent more passengers and uses 16 
per cent less fuel.
Ryanair has repeatedly extended its Max delivery timetable. At its quarterly results yesterday, it said it would not 
receive the first planes until September or October and that it would not start to benefit from cost savings until late 
in 2021. In a previous update, the airline said it expected to receive only 10 planes for the summer of 2020, down 
from an earlier figure of 20.
The Dublin-based airline has also extended by "at least one or two years" - until 2025 or 2026 - its target to carry 
200m passengers, prompting analysts to observe it will now be harder for Ryanair to achieve its target for 
(EURO)2bn in annual operating profits. "Moving that goalpost makes that (EURO)2bn even harder to achieve if at 
all," said Daniel Roeska, senior analyst at Bernstein Research, Mr Roeska added that Ryanair changing its growth 
targets could benefit the rest of the industry. "If Ryanair isn't growing that quickly, that means less capacity in the 
market and everybody can [charge higher] fares."
The latest Max delays were expected and could be "a blessing in disguise" for the airline, Mr Roeska said. "If 
Ryanair was receiving the planes right now, capacity growth would be higher and fares would be lower."
Max jet delays hit Ryanair 's plans to attract more passengers Airlines
Micheal O'Leary, chief executive, said the original delivery schedule had now been delayed by 12 months and 
Boeing now expected approval to resume flights in June. "We had hoped to have 55 aircraft in the fleet for the 
summer of 2020. We'll have none," he said.
"What that means for us is obviously much slower growth in 2021. We expect very modest growth through the 
summer of 2020."
Mr O'Leary also said he expected no long-term impact from coronavirus, saying Ryanair's experience with Sars and 
with avian flu was that they were "mildly good" for European short haul travel. "More people were likely to holiday in 
Europe rather than travelling long haul to Asia ... and we think that will play out again. But we should be wary on the 
short-term impact."
Ryanair shares rose 6 per cent in London after the results were published. The group had already upgraded its 
fullyear forecast in January - predicting pre-tax profits of between (EURO)950m and (EURO)1.05bn, compared with 
an earlier range of (EURO)800m to (EURO)900m. Net profit in the three months to December was (EURO)88m, 
against a (EURO)66m loss in the same period one year previously.
On UK-EU trade after Brexit, Mr O'Leary said the mood music was negative but dismissed "tough talk" from 
London. "The British are talking tough about non-alignment and all the rest of it, in which case that will be a 
negative certainly for the airline industry and for an agreement [for] the continuation of the Open Skies regime."

We are all strong enough to bear the misfortunes of others. Ryanair is the latest business to illustrate the truth of 
that sardonic maxim. Thomas Cook has collapsed and rival airlines such as Norwegian have been cutting routes.
That has helped the Irish airline and its UK nemesis easyJet to fill more seats and squeeze more cash out of those 
sitting in them.
In Ryanair's case, that meant lifting the load factor 1 percentage point to 96 per cent in the third quarter, and raising 
revenues per passenger by 13 per cent.
In similar vein, delays to the delivery of the Boeing 737 Max - grounded after two fatal crashes - are something of a 
blessing in disguise.
Ryanair will not start taking delivery until September or October. So scratch that additional 4 per cent capacity 
enabled by the bigger-bodied planes for a couple more years.
But here's the rub. The Max is more efficient, burning 16 per cent less fuel.
Oil is the biggest cost for strippeddown Ryanair, accounting for 38 per cent of the total bill in the latest quarter. 
These savings will now not flow till late next fiscal year.
Also pushed further down the track is a target to carry 200m passengers - or "guests", to use Ryanair's preferred 
euphemism - now delayed by one or two years to FY2025 or 2026. It expects this year to fly 154m passengers.
Ryanair : seat feat Lex.
That implies roughly halving annual passenger growth - now at 8 per cent - and suggests a new dawn for pricing 
deliberations at the shouty, pack 'em in airline. In a best-case scenario, it will focus on yields over revenues; but 
earnings will still suffer.
Fittingly for an airline that specialises in short hops, near-term tailwinds are in Ryanair's favour. But they also help 
easyJet, the rival whose occasional misfortunes Ryanair bears most cheerfully of all. Shareholders were right to 
push Ryanair's share price higher this morning. The smart ones will exit before the inevitable mediumterm 
turbulence hits.

737 Max delivery delays will hurt growth plans as it swung back into profit in its third quarter.
Ryanair was expecting its first delivery of the aeroplane to arrive in spring 2019, but it admitted yesterday that will 
now not happen until September or October 2020.
The fresh Boeing 737 Max delivery delays will mean it will not meet its 200m passengers per year target until as 
late as 2026, two years later than planned.
That will also prevent Ryanair from achieving cost savings associated with the new aircraft until late 2021.
Nevertheless, Ryanair swung back into profit for the three months to the end of December thanks to strong 
Christmas bookings.
Profit after tax hit (EURO)88m (£74.1m) for the quarter, compared to the same period the previous year when 
Ryanair fell to a (EURO)66m loss. The budget airline welcomed almost 36m passengers across the period, six per 
cent higher than in 2018.
It also posted a 13 per cent climb in revenue per guest, comprising of nine per cent higher air fares.
Meanwhile a 21 per cent jump in passenger spending was attributed to more travellers paying for priority boarding 
and the ability to choose their seats.
However, Ryanair's fuel bill climbed 14 per cent to (EURO)700m due to higher prices and higher traffic.
New 737 Max delays hurt Ryanair passenger goals
The Boeing 737 Max crisis also contributed to higher costs, as Ryanair was forced to shell out on maintenance of 
older planes that are now staying in the fleet. Richard Flood, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: "This is a 
strong set of results in a weak part of the year for Ryanair. The reduction in seat capacity across the sector... should 
enable Ryanair to maintain strong pricing."

Ryanair delays growth targets due to Boeing Max jet trouble
Ryanair delays growth targets due to Boeing Max jet trouble

LONDON (AP) - The CEO of Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said Monday that his airline is interested in revising 
orders for Boeing 737 Max jets to get a new, larger version of the plane.
Michael O'Leary said his airline has submitted an offer to Boeing for an undisclosed number of Boeing Max 10 jets, 
a 230-seat version of the plane that has been grounded around the world since March. O'Leary suggested that 
discussions with Boeing will not be completed until the Max returns to service and Boeing resumes production.
Boeing installed a new CEO last month, and O'Leary said Boeing's new management team "is not yet in a position 
to be able to talk to us about a new order. We understand that, but we have the offering and we expect to be at the 
head of the queue."
O'Leary said pricing of the Max will need to change to reflect the damage that two crashes did to its reputation.
"There is no doubt we will have passengers who would be nervous to fly on the Max when we do take delivery of 
the aircraft," said O'Leary, who called it a great plane that will transform Ryanair over the next 10 years with its 
better fuel mileage.
O'Leary made the comments on a call with analysts as Ryanair released financial results and said the grounding of 
its Max 200s, which have around 200 seats, will delay its growth targets.
The budget carrier, which is based in Ireland and carries more passengers than any other airline in Europe, plans to 
extend by a year or two its target of flying 200 million people per year.
It now expects to make that target in 2025 or the year after.
The 737 Max was grounded worldwide in March after two crashes within five months killed 346 people in Indonesia 
and Ethiopia.
Chicago-based Boeing is updating the plane to improve safety and said last month that it doesn't expect U.S. 
regulators to approve its changes until this summer.
Ryanair delays growth targets due to Boeing Max jet trouble
Ryanair said it does not expect to take deliveries of the jets until September or October, after the busy summer 
travel period.
Like many airlines, Ryanair had been hoping to boost business with the 737 Max. The plane can provide more 
seats while burning less fuel, which makes up for a large part of the cost of flying the plane.

Ryanair Swings to Profit in Third Quarter, Buoyed by Stronger Traffic Over Festive Period
Ryanair Swings to Profit in Third Quarter, Buoyed by Stronger Traffic Over 
Festive Period

 Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) swung to a profit in the third quarter, helped by stronger traffic in the Christmas and New 
Year period, but the air carrier advised that likely delays to the delivery of Boeing 737-MAX-200 would mean cost 
savings associated with the more fuel-efficient aircraft would not be seen until late in the fiscal 2021 year.
The Dublin-Ireland-based carrier reported a profit after tax of 88 million euros ($97.7 million) compared with a net 
loss of 66 million euros a year ago in results posted on Monday.
Traffic jumped by 6% to 35.9 million passengers, helping push up revenue to 1.91 billion euros in the period under 
review from 1.58 billion euros a year earlier. The load factor, which is a measure of an airline's capacity utilization, 
also climbed by 100 basis points to 96%.
The carrier, which aims to be plastic-free in five years and cut noise emissions by up to 40% per seat, said fuel bill 
rose by 14% to 700 million euros because of higher jet oil prices and traffic growth. Ex-fuel, unit costs rose by 1% 
due in part to higher staff costs in the third quarter.
Ryanair, which had raised its full-year profit after tax guidance in January to a range of 950 million euros to 1.05 
billion euros, expects to end fiscal 2020 "close to the mid-point" of this range as forward bookings for the fourth 
quarter are ahead from a year ago at "slightly better-than-expected fares."
However the company observed that delivery of the group's first Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft had been "repeatedly 
delayed" from the second quarter of 2019. "It is now likely that our first MAX aircraft will not deliver until Sept. or 
Oct. 2020," Monday's statement said. "The requirement for MAX simulator training will also slow down the delivery 
of backlogged aircraft and new deliveries," it added.
Ryanair said that it believes the aircraft  -- which has 4% more seats and burns 16% less fuel -- when delivered, 
would "transform" its cost base and its business for the next decade. "Due to these delivery delays, we won't see 
any of these cost savings until late FY21. As a direct result of these delivery delays, we plan to extend our 200m 
p.a. passenger target by at least one or two years to FY25 or FY26."

Ryanair cheered investors with a return to profit in the third quarter but warned its target of flying 200 million 
passengers per year may be delayed two years due to the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jet.
Shares in Europe's largest budget airline jumped 4% on Monday following the results.
Ryanair reported profit after tax of 88 million euros for the three months to December 31 after a loss of 66 million a 
year earlier.
Average fares rose 9% and revenue from optional extras such as pre-booked seating jumped 21%.
Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson in a note described the results as "stellar" and said he expected the positive 
momentum in revenue per passenger to continue in the summer. Goodbody are market makers in Ryanair shares.
CEO Michael O'Leary, however, suggested Boeing's delivery schedule could ultimately be up to two years late - 
meaning Ryanair will not reach its goal of 200 million passengers a year by March 2024.
"At best that means we will have to roll forward our plans to fly 200 million passengers per year ... by at least 12 
months, possibly 24," O'Leary said in a pre-recorded video presentation when asked about the grounding of the 
MAX and Boeing's decision to temporarily halt production of the jet.
Ryanair is one of the biggest customers of the grounded jet, with 210 on order.
It aims to have 55 of them flying by summer 2021, a year later than originally planned, with 50 more planes per year 
due for each of the following three years.
Ryanair says plans to move from 'breakneck' growth
Boeing last month said it did not expect the MAX, which was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes which killed 
346 passengers and crew, to return to service until mid-2020.
Ryanair, which does not take deliveries during its summer peak of June-August, said on Monday it did not expect to 
receive the first MAX jets until September or October.
It will take a maximum of eight planes per month, or around 50 deliveries per year, O'Leary said.
Asked if there was any risk to its plans for 55 MAX jets flying by next summer, Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan 
told Reuters: "I don't believe so, but we have been disappointed before."
Ryanair in January raised its profit forecast citing a better-than-expected performance over Christmas and New 
Year as reduced capacity in Europe pushed up fares.
On Monday it reiterated that forecast, saying it expected profit after tax for the year to March 31 around the mid-
point of a range of 950 million and 1.05 billion euros.
The MAX delays and the retraction of smaller struggling airlines have both helped cut capacity, pushing up fares, 
CFO Sorahan said.
"Clearly the capacity coming out of the market has been helpful," he said. (Reuters)

A normal Ryanair flight from Budapest to Edinburgh became a "flight from hell" when Shaun Pinkerton and three 
other passengers collapsed on Friday.
According to Pinkerton, passengers began to faint about an hour into the three-hour flight, when a 17-year old 
collapsed and had to receive CPR. Another passenger soon followed, and 27-year old Pinkerton was the third 
person aboard the flight to faint, in addition to one more after him.
"Everyone was panicking and we still don't really know what happened," he said. "It makes you not want to fly 
again.
Cabin crew responded by using oxygen tanks to perform CPR on the fallen passengers. Pinkerton noted, "I was 
knocked out and needed an oxygen mask. Then I went into shock and was totally shaking."
Pinkerton blames the aircraft for the incident and believes he and the other three passengers are owed 
compensation, stating "There was something seriously wrong with that flight, folk were worrying there wasn't 
enough oxygen. I don't know why they didn't divert the plane to land sooner."
Edinburgh Airport confirmed that an emergency first aid request was made by the flight crew and that a team of 
medical staff was on hand to meet the aircraft when it landed. The airport denies that the aircraft was at fault for the 
fainting spells.
"The crew of this flight from Budapest to Edinburgh (31 Jan) called ahead to request medical assistance on landing 
after two customers became ill onboard," a Ryanair spokesperson stated. "The aircraft landed normally and these 
customers were met by medics for further treatment."
The incident and Edinburgh Airport's response left Pinkerton traumatized. Pinkerton is due to travel to Madrid and 
Poland in the next few months; however, he is now hesitant to do so.
"I don't want to step foot on a plane ever again. It was like something out of a movie."

       Ryanair Holdings plc. (RYA.L) reported that its third-quarter profit attributable to equity holders of parent was 
87.8 million euros or 0.0784 euros per share, compared to loss of 66.1 million euros or 0.0580 euros per share in 
the same quarter last year.
 Ryanair plans to extend its 200 million per annum passenger target by at least one or two years to fiscal year 2025 
or fiscal year 2026, as a result of Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircrat delivery delays.
 The airline now expects full year traffic to grow by 8% to 154 million guests.
 Ryanair recently raised its full-year profit after tax outlook to a range of 0.95 billion euros - 1.05 billion euros, 
reflecting stronger Christmas and New Year travel bookings, at better than expected fares. 
 On the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the midpoint of the new profit after tax guidance 
range. This guidance is heavily dependent on close-in the fourth-quarter fares and the absence of any security 
events.
 Scheduled revenues for the third-quarter increased by 16% to 1.19 billion euros, due to 6% traffic growth to 35.9 
million guests and a 9% increase in average fares. 
 Ancillary revenues increased by 28% to 720.0 million euros due to 6% traffic growth and improved uptake of 
ancillary products, particularly priority boarding and reserved seats.
 Quarterly total revenue rose 21% to 1.91 billion euros from 1.58 billion euros in the previous year.

       European markets ended higher on Monday, due largely to bargain hunting after recent sharp declines. 
 Worries about coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the global economy lingered, but the focus shifted to 
corporate announcements and economic data.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 advanced 0.25%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 gained 0.55%, Germany's DAX ended nearly 
0.5% up and France's CAC 40 gained 0.51%, while Switzerland's SMI ended 0.35% up.
 Among other markets in Europe, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain 
ended on a positive note.  
 Austria, Finland, Greec, Iceland, Portugal and Russia declined, while 
 Norway, Sweden, Turkey and Ukraine ended flat.
 In the U.K. market, EasyJet gained about 3.85%. Auto Traders advanced 3.1%, while Scottish Mortgage, Diageo 
and Rentokil International gained 2.7 to 3%.
 Future Plc shares gained more than 4% after the company said it expects the outcome for the full year to be 
materially ahead of current market expectations despite some uncertainty in the macro-economic environment. 
 Shares of NMC Health plunged nearly 20%. Polymetal International and Royal Dutch Shell ended lower by 2.3% 
and 1.8%, respectively. 
 In France, Technip ended stronger by about 3.5%. STMicroElectronics, Peugeot, Capgemini, Schneider Electric, 
L'Oreal, Legrand, Essilor Exottica, Dassault Systemes, Sodexo and Accor gained 1 to 2%.
 Ingenico shares jumped nearly 17% after Worldline announced the acquisition of the technology company. 
European Stocks Close Higher On Bargain Hunting
 In the German market, SAP, E.ON, HeidelbergCement, Lufthansa, Muench.Rueckvers, Henkel and Merck gained 
1.3 to 2%.
 Deutsche Bank and Covestro ended lower by about 1.85% and 1.1%, respectively. 
 In the Swiss market, Julius Baer shares declined sharply after the bank reported a 5% drop in adjusted net 
earnings for the year 2019. 
 Shares of Siemens Healthineers ended notably lower after the company said its first quarter net income declined 
12% to 304 million euros from 345 million euros last year.
 Ryanair Holdings gained in strength after the company swung to a profit in the third quarter on the back of a strong 
Christmas period.
 In economic news, Eurozone manufacturing contracted at the slowest rate in nine months in January as the decline 
in output, new orders and purchases eased and business confidence improved.
 The euro area purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for the manufacturing sector climbed to 47.9 from 46.3 in 
December, final survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday. The flash reading was 47.8.
 The reading has remained below 50 for 12 months now, but the latest score was the highest since April 2019.
 Britain's manufacturing sector stabilized at the start of the year, led by gain in new orders, employment and 
business confidence as the political uncertainty subsided after the general election.
 The seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, for the manufacturing sector climbed to a nine-
month high of 50.0 in January, which was slightly higher than the flash reading of 49.8, survey data from IHS Markit 
and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &Supply; showed on Monday.
 As score of 50 suggests the factory sector neither grew nor shrink. The last time the PMI climbed above 50 was in 
April 2019. In December, the PMI reading was 47.5.
 The U.K. exited the European Union at 11 pm on Friday, and has now begun an 11-month transition period during 
which it expects to strike a trade deal with the bloc.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) placed an order for an undisclosed number of Boeing (BA) 737 Max 10 aircraft, but the deal 
won't be finalized until after the plane returns to service, Reuters reported Monday. 
Speaking at a post-earnings conference call, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary reportedly confirmed that his 
company is in discussions with the plane maker for MAX 10s, which have a 230-seat capacity, the news company

 London's main index bounced back on Monday after hitting a seven-week low in the previous session, when news 
of the first cases of the coronavirus in Britain hammered equities and fanned worries over its impact to the global 
economy.
The FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 added 0.2% on Monday. Both indexes had shed more than 3% last month as the 
virus outbreak sapped risk appetite.
Stock markets in Britain were a stark contrast to those in China, where shares plunged in the first trading session 
following an extended Lunar New Year break, as the death toll from the coronavirus epidemic rose to 361 in the 
Asian country.
London-listed shares of Ryanair Holdings Plc jumped 3.6% after the Irish carrier raised its annual profit forecast,

at 11pm on Friday,
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 28 points, or 0.38 percent, at 7,313, rebounding from a seven-week low hit on

exceeded that of the SARS outbreak. 
 Ryanair Holdings soared 4.3 percent. The Irish carrier swung to a profit in the third quarter on the back of a strong 
Christmas period.
 Tobacco giant Imperial Brands advanced 1.2 percent after announcing the appointment of Stefan Bomhard as 
Chief Executive Officer, effective at a date to be announced.

materially ahead of current market expectations, despite some uncertainty in the macro-economic environment.

Feb 03, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In this Sept. 12, 2018 file photo, a 
Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany. Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said Monday Feb. 
3, 2020, that the grounding of the new Boeing Max jets will delay its growth targets. The budget carrier, which is 
based in Ireland and carries more passengers than any other airline in Europe, plans to extend by a year or two its 
target of flying 200 million people per year. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)LONDON (AP) — Europe's busiest 
airline, Ryanair, said Monday that the grounding of the new Boeing Max jets will delay its growth targets. The 
budget carrier, which is based in Ireland and carries more passengers than any other airline in Europe, plans to 
extend by a year or two its target of flying 200 million people per year. It now expects to make that target in 2025 or 
the year after. The 737 Max was grounded worldwide in March, after two crashes within five months killed 346 
people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.  Boeing is updating the plane to improve safety and said last month that it doesn't 
expect federal regulators to approve its changes until this summer, several months longer than the company was 
saying just a few weeks ago. Ryanair said it does not expect to take deliveries of the jets until September or 
October, after the busy summer travel period. Like many airlines, Ryanair had been hoping to boost business with 
the 737 Max, as the plane can provide more seats while burning less fuel, which makes up for a large part of the 
cost of flying the plane. Companies Mentioned in This Article

Analyst Blog: 4 Top Stocks to Buy as Irish Economy Gathers SteamIreland, the fastest-growing economy of the 
European Union, has gone from strength to strength in the past few years. The Irish labor market is currently tight 
with unemployment at a 13-year low. 
Also, the country's finance ministry has raised its growth forecast for the Celtic Tiger.Finally, broadly encouraging 
business conditions and improving Irish wages have also been pivotal in shaping up this economy. Such favorable 
conditions call for investing in stocks from Ireland.13-Year Low Unemployment Per the latest reports from Ireland's 
Central Statistics Office (CSO), the country's unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.8% in December. This 
also happens to be the metric's lowest settlement in the past 13 years. Furthermore, economists remain optimistic 
about another strong year of employment growth within the Irish economy.The CSO also reported that the total 
number of unemployed workers was 119,000 in December. In comparison, this figure was 356,600 or roughly 16% 
in February 2012. Also, the headline unemployment rate was the lowest since January 2007. Notably, the metric is 
also three percentage points lower than the eurozone average of 7.5%.Ireland Increases GDP Forecast for 2020As 
the terms of Brexit become clearer, Ireland's finance ministry expects the country's economy to grow at a higher 
pace than earlier expected. The finance ministry expects Ireland's GDP to have advanced 6.3% in 2019. Also, the 
expected rate of growth has been pegged at 3.9% for 2020 and 3% for 2021.The latest estimates are based on the 
free-trade deal between the European Union and Britain. Terms of this deal include the existing arrangements or a 
possible extension of the transition period that finishes by the end of 2020.Rating Agencies Upbeat About Ireland's 
ProspectsTwo of the world's leading credit rating agencies recently vested their faith in the prospects of the Irish 
economy. The agencies expect the country to weather any tensions related to Brexit, geopolitics and trade related 
concerns.German agency Scope has kept its credit rating of A+, unchanged for the country. However, it has 
improved its long-term prognosis of the Irish economy from stable to positive.On the other hand, another leading 
rating agency, Moody's, has stated that the country's economic growth would remain above the average growth for

the eurozone. It expects the country's GDP to advance 3.2% in 2020, which would remain above the eurozone

Ryanair could seek to become debt free
Ryanair could seek to become debt free
AirFinance Journal
February 2020

Ryanair could seek to become debt free within the next three to four years as it prepares to pay back maturing 
bonds, group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary has suggested.
Speaking on an analyst call on 3 February, O'Leary said that Ryanair would prefer to use its free cash to pay down 
debt rather than raising fresh funds.   "I don't want to be sucked into this situation as one of those companies 
[where] once you start raising bond money you just start replacing one bond with the other bond and the debt never 
gets paid back," he said.   "Ultimately I would like to be conservative, pay back the debt; we own all of our fleet of 
aircraft and we will be generating very significant cash to our annual cash flows.
"Who's to say we shouldn't try to be debt free in the next three to four years?" he added.   Ryanair chief financial 
officer Neil Sorahan said that the airline has an opportunity over the next 18 months to pay off (EURO)1.3 billion 
($1.4 billion) of maturing debt, which will remove the 2% interest rate it pays from its balance sheet.   Sorahan said 
that Ryanair had already raised (EURO)750 million of "very cheap" unsecured bonds at a coupon of 0.65%.
He said that while Ryanair is approaching a "peak" capital expenditure period, he does not foresee the need for the 
carrier to raise further bonds or refinance in the immediate future.    "If we decide to go back at some stage to 
refinance it will be at a time of our choosing at a time when it is just too attractive to say no," said Sorahan.   
Despite the share buyback and the impact of IFRS 16 ((EURO)230 million), net debt was just over (EURO)700 
million at the end of the third quarter, 31 December.    Due to the uncertainty surrounding Boeing Max aircraft 
deliveries, peak capex and maturing bonds in 2021, the Ryanair board has decided to extend the current 
(EURO)700 million buyback programme until the end of July.   The low-cost carrier achieved an operating profit 
of (EURO)91 million for the quarter, from a loss of (EURO)68 million for the same period the previous year.
O'Leary said that Ryanair has not paid a pre-delivery payment (PDP) for more than one year while it awaits 
confirmation from Boeing regarding the delivery of 737 Max aircraft to the Irish carrier. Ryanair now expects to have 
approximately 55 Max aircraft in service for summer 2021.
Sorahan said that the airline expects PDPs to begin "ramping up" once delivery schedules are firmed up. O'Leary 
said that compensation talks with Boeing were moving to focus on "repricing" of future deliveries to reflect the 
"reputational damage" done to the Max brand. Compensation is being calculated on the basis of the impact of the 
grounding on Ryanair passenger numbers and associated ancillary revenues that had been lost, he added.
Ryanair could seek to become debt free
Ryanair is ready to begin negotiations with the US OEM over a future Max 10 order but O'Leary said the new 
management led by chief executive officer David Calhoun is not yet in a position to begin such talks.
O'Leary said that disruption caused by the 737 Max grounding meant Ryanair would miss its target of hitting 200 
million passengers per annum by one or two years, and he now expects to reach this goal by 2025 or 2026.
One positive that O'Leary noted was Ryanair's ability to source leased 737NGs for rents of $170,000 to $180,000 
per month.

On a quiet side street in Mayfair is the office of Lucien Farrell, a secretive hedge fund executive trying to negotiate a 
£100m state bailout.
Mr Farrell, 45, has run Cyrus Capital in Europe for 15 years, making his name as a canny investor in distressed 
debt while carefully preserving his privacy.
But no previous investment has been as high-profile as Flybe, the ailing airline Cyrus owns alongside Richard 
Branson's Virgin Atlantic.
As chairman of Connect Airways, Flybe's holding company, Mr Farrell is trying to secure state support to keep the 
lossmaking airline airborne. He has played a key role in Whitehall talks over the terms of a deal that would prevent 
the carrier from being put into administration; it could be agreed next week.
The proposed rescue has attracted outrage and legal threats from rivals including Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. A 
collapse, on the other hand, would bring the scrutiny of the Insolvency Service and regulators.
The well-connected Mr Farrell counts among his contacts Ben Elliot, co-chairman of the Conservative party, whose 
aunt is the Duchess of Cornwall. Mr Farrell was a classmate of Mr Elliot at Eton College and more recently has 
participated in bike rides organised by Mr Elliot's charity, the Quintessentially Foundation. He is also a patron to the 
Victoria and Albert Museum, where Mr Elliot is a trustee.
Secretive hedge fund boss struggles to keep Flybe aloft Corporate person in the news
Unlike some hedge fund managers, Mr Farrell, who lives in Notting Hill, west London, with his children and wife 
Sophie, is extremely private, say several people close to him.
He was one of about 500 individuals, alongside Jimmy Carr, a comedian, and George Robinson, a hedge fund 
manager, who were directors of a tax avoidance scheme known as Rushmore that was closed in 2009 following an 
investigation by HM Revenue & Customs.
Close to invisible online, he has never given a media interview, and declined to comment for this article.
One hedge fund manager, who considers Mr Farrell a friend despite facing off against him in investments, said he 
"takes no hostages" and was "unbelievably crafty".
"When I saw that one airline could actually be getting a government bailout, I wasn't surprised it was one Lucien is 
involved in," he said.
Mr Farrell, a Cambridge university graduate, specialises in distressed investing, a field that often pits hedge funds 
against one another in sometimes acrimonious disputes.
He became a founding partner of Cyrus when he was 30 years old after Stephen Freidheim, his mentor and US 
distressed investing stalwart, tapped him to run the London office. Cyrus is named after Mr Freidheim's father, who 
manages money at his Yale University alma mater.
Since it was founded in 2005, Cyrus has accumulated $4bn in assets, with Mr Farrell leading bets on household 
names such as Co-operative Bank. Turnover in the UK, where Cyrus has five staff, has risen from £2.5m to £9.7m 
since 2005, and profits from £1.4m to £7.5m, latest accounts filed at Companies House show.
"I have been involved in investments in over 100 companies, the majority of which would be considered stressed or 
distressed companies," Mr Farrell said in sworn testimony for a 2016 US court case, which records show was 
signed in San Cassiano, an Italian ski resort.
Cyrus became a 40 per cent shareholder in Flybe last year when it joined Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Air to acquire 
the airline for £2.2m, equivalent to 1p per share. Flybe's equity shareholders approved the deal after being warned 
it was otherwise likely to be wound up. Virgin and Stobart each own 30 per cent.
The group has put £110m into the airline, partially through loans with tight security over Flybe's assets. Financial 
troubles caused partly by overcapacity, rising maintenance costs and air passenger duty prompted the talks with 
ministers, though the company has denied it wants a bailout. Mark Anderson, Flybe chief executive, said this month 
the loan would be "the same as any loan we'd take from any bank".
While the rationale behind Mr Farrell's investment in Flybe remains unclear, it is not the first time Cyrus has 
partnered with Sir Richard to make a contrarian bet on a domestic airline. The hedge fund helped the billionaire 
establish Virgin America in 2005 and the two shareholders shared a windfall of $1.4bn when it was snapped up by 
rival Alaska Air for $2.6bn a decade later.
"There's not a lot of hedge funds that can say they've made money buying airline equity," said one distressed debt 
investor. Still, several others thought Mr Farrell was unlikely to repeat the trick with Flybe.
"I don't know how he makes money out of it," said a restructuring adviser who knows Mr Farrell. "The only way you 
make money is if you sell it. And I don't see that happening." Tabby Kinder, Robert Smith, Dan Thomas and Tanya 
Powley

"takes no hostages" and was "unbelievably crafty".
"When I saw that one airline could actually be getting a government bailout, I wasn't surprised it was one Lucien is 
involved in," he said.
Mr Farrell, a Cambridge university graduate, specialises in distressed investing, a field that often pits hedge funds 
against one another in sometimes acrimonious disputes.
He became a founding partner of Cyrus when he was 30 years old after Stephen Freidheim, his mentor and US 
distressed investing stalwart, tapped him to run the London office. Cyrus is named after Mr Freidheim's father, who 
manages money at his Yale University alma mater.
Since it was founded in 2005, Cyrus has accumulated $4bn in assets, with Mr Farrell leading bets on household 
names such as Co-operative Bank. Turnover in the UK, where Cyrus has five staff, has risen from £2.5m to £9.7m 
since 2005, and profits from £1.4m to £7.5m, latest accounts filed at Companies House show.
"I have been involved in investments in over 100 companies, the majority of which would be considered stressed or 
distressed companies," Mr Farrell said in sworn testimony for a 2016 US court case, which records show was 
signed in San Cassiano, an Italian ski resort.
Cyrus became a 40 per cent shareholder in Flybe last year when it joined Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Air to acquire 
the airline for £2.2m, equivalent to 1p per share. Flybe's equity shareholders approved the deal after being warned 
it was otherwise likely to be wound up. Virgin and Stobart each own 30 per cent.
The group has put £110m into the airline, partially through loans with tight security over Flybe's assets. Financial 
troubles caused partly by overcapacity, rising maintenance costs and air passenger duty prompted the talks with 
ministers, though the company has denied it wants a bailout. Mark Anderson, Flybe chief executive, said this month 
the loan would be "the same as any loan we'd take from any bank".
While the rationale behind Mr Farrell's investment in Flybe remains unclear, it is not the first time Cyrus has 
partnered with Sir Richard to make a contrarian bet on a domestic airline. The hedge fund helped the billionaire 
establish Virgin America in 2005 and the two shareholders shared a windfall of $1.4bn when it was snapped up by 
rival Alaska Air for $2.6bn a decade later.
"There's not a lot of hedge funds that can say they've made money buying airline equity," said one distressed debt 
investor. Still, several others thought Mr Farrell was unlikely to repeat the trick with Flybe.
"I don't know how he makes money out of it," said a restructuring adviser who knows Mr Farrell. "The only way you 
make money is if you sell it. And I don't see that happening." Tabby Kinder, Robert Smith, Dan Thomas and Tanya

On a quiet side street in Mayfair is the office of Lucien Farrell, a secretive hedge fund executive trying to negotiate a 
£100m state bailout.
Mr Farrell, 45, has run Cyrus Capital in Europe for 15 years, making his name as a canny investor in distressed 
debt while carefully preserving his privacy.
But no previous investment has been as high-profile as Flybe, the ailing airline Cyrus owns alongside Richard 
Branson's Virgin Atlantic.
As chairman of Connect Airways, Flybe's holding company, Mr Farrell is trying to secure state support to keep the 
lossmaking airline airborne. He has played a key role in Whitehall talks over the terms of a deal that would prevent 
the carrier from being put into administration; it could be agreed next week.

The proposed rescue has attracted outrage and legal threats from rivals including Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. A 
collapse, on the other hand, would bring the scrutiny of the Insolvency Service and regulators.

The well-connected Mr Farrell counts among his contacts Ben Elliot, co-chairman of the Conservative party, whose 
aunt is the Duchess of Cornwall. Mr Farrell was a classmate of Mr Elliot at Eton College and more recently has 
participated in bike rides organised by Mr Elliot's charity, the Quintessentially Foundation. He is also a patron to the 
Victoria and Albert Museum, where Mr Elliot is a trustee.
Unlike some hedge fund managers, Mr Farrell, who lives in Notting Hill, west London, with his children and wife 
Sophie, is extremely private, say several people close to him.
He was one of about 500 individuals, alongside Jimmy Carr, a comedian, and George Robinson, a hedge fund 
manager, who were directors of a tax avoidance scheme known as Rushmore that was closed in 2009 following an 
investigation by HM Revenue & Customs.
Close to invisible online, he has never given a media interview, and declined to comment for this article.

US lessor GECAS is transitioning an Airbus A320 to Ryanair's Laudamotion from previous operator Philippine 
Airlines (PAL).
The CFM56-5B4/3-equipped unit was delivered new from GECAS to PAL in March 2012; it has been stored at 
Clark airport since 31 July 2019.
Ahead of redelivery to Laudamotion, the A320 has been reconfigured from PAL's dual-class layout to the European 
LCC's single-class configuration.
This latest fleet addition will become Laudamotion's 23rd A320. The Vienna-based budget airline, which was fully 
acquired by Ryaanir last year, leases all 23 units.

A judge has ordered Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) to pay some of the legal costs of its former chief operations officer, 
Peter Bellew, incurred while fighting the carrier's failed efforts to block his move to easyJet (U2, London Luton), The 
Irish Times has reported. As previously reported, on December 23, after an eight-day hearing, the Irish High Court 
rejected Ryanair's attempt to force Bellew to comply with a 12-month non-compete clause, ruling that it was 
unenforceable. Bellew has denied he was bound by the covenant and is preparing to start work at easyJet having 
completed a six-month notice period of his resignation from Ryanair in July 2019.

Ryanair plans to implement a new pay structure for its Irish pilots based on the recommendations of an independent 
mediator, the Irish airline said on Wednesday, in an effort to end one of its most intractable labor disputes.
The Forsa trade union, which represents Irish pilots, was not immediately available to comment on the 
announcement.
Ryanair has suffered several waves of industrial action in the past two years by pilots and cabin crew over terms 
and conditions, but the situation has eased in recent months after management agreed terms with several national 
unions.
The Irish pilots union, which represents less than 10% of the airline's 5,500 pilots, is one of the most active and 
agreement in Ryanair's home market would mark a significant breakthrough in attempts to normalize industrial 
relations.
"Ryanair today (Jan 29) confirmed that it had accepted before Christmas the recommendations of independent 
mediator Mr Kieran Mulvey on a 4 Year Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) with the pilot union Forsa, to cover all 
Ryanair's directly employed pilots in Ireland to 2024," the airline said in a statement.
"Ryanair will now implement the terms of this CLA, which will deliver a new pay structure along with a fixed 5/4 
roster for the next four years," it said, referring to the airline's traditional pilot schedule of five days' work followed by 
four days off. (Reuters)

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary has issued another sharp rebuke to chancellor Sajid Javid in the wake of the 
government's rescue of Flybe, this time saying the UK's business strategy is "doomed to fail".
In a letter bound to further escalate the row between the two, O'Leary called the struggling regional airline a "loss-
making turkey".
He said the decision to defer Flybe's air passenger duty (APD) tax was a result of being "blindsided" by the regional 
airline's billionaire owners. "If the first critical business decision of your new government is to bail out a lossmaking 
turkey like Flybe, for the sole benefit of billionaires like Richard Branson, Delta Airlines, and Cyrus Capital, then 
your business strategy is doomed to fail," he said.
O'Leary was responding to a letter from Javid, who last week dismissed claims that Flybe received unfair state aid. 
Javid had said that the decision to defer APD for Flybe was a "standard Time to Pay arrangement… because of 
their short-term difficulties".
The chancellor's letter came after O'Leary threatened to sue the government over the matter. Yesterday, O'Leary 
called the letter "both inaccurate and seriously misleading". "If these billionaire shareholders are not willing to put 
their hands in their own deep pockets to bail out the lossmaking Flybe, then why is your government giving them a 
bail out?" he added.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said the UK government is "blindsided by 
billionaires" following a state rescue deal for troubled regional airline Flybe, London's Financial Times reported 
Tuesday, citing a letter to UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid.
O'Leary wrote that Flybe, which he described as a failed business model, was "doomed to fail," according to the 
report. He also argued that Flybe's owners should pay the bill to bail out the "lossmaking" carrier.
The Ryanair boss's letter was in response to a government letter on Jan. 24.
Flybe's owners are seeking 100 million pounds sterling ($130.1 million) worth of short-term loan from the UK 
government, sources said. They vowed to invest at least 30 million pounds in the airline, with an extra 20 million 
pounds expected later.

Jan 28, 2020( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Description Ryanair has signed a 
formal recognition agreement  Credits Thomas Lohnes/AFP/Getty Images Alt Text Ryanair plane  Staff memo 
comes as Michael O'Leary again criticises Sajid Javid  One-Minute Read[1] Wednesday, January 29, 2020 - 
6:01am Ryanair has warned it may close bases and cut jobs after the date for delivery of its first 10 of Boeing's 
grounded 737 Max aircraft was delayed until the autumn. In a memo sent to pilots on Monday, the Irish low-cost 
airline said Boeing would not deliver the first aircraft until September or October at the earliest, as Ryanair does not 
take deliveries during its peak summer months of June, July and August. The airline had initially hoped to have the 
planes by March or April. 
See related #8216;I never understood wind': Trump's strangest quotes of 2019[2] Donald Trump: impeachment 
timeline[3] Is Donald Trump mentally fit to be president?[4] Eddie Wilson, an executive at Ryanair, wrote that the 
airline's summer schedule relied on the delivery of the 10 planes. The memo said the commercial team would be 
drawing up plans for job cuts over the coming week. Boeing's 737 Max aircraft have been grounded worldwide 
since March 2019, following two deadly crashes that were blamed on the model's faulty systems. More than 340 
people died in the two crashes. Ryanair is not the only airline affected. Last week the US airline Southwest said the 
grounding had cut $828m (637m) off its 2019 profits. Meanwhile, company boss Michael O'Leary has accused 
Chancellor Sajid Javid of making #8216;inaccurate and misleading#8217; statements[5], thus reigniting the row 
over help offered to Flybe. After the government approved help for the struggling regional airline, including giving it 
extra time to pay outstanding Air Passenger Duty, O'Leary told Javid that allowing Flybe to delay payment was 
#8216;in breach of state aid rules#8217;. The letter comes weeks after O'Leary threatened legal action[6] over the 
government's help for Flybe. He said that unless Javid confirmed what support was being given to Flybe within 
seven days, Ryanair would launch proceedings against the government. However, the government has insisted that 
the 
rescue 
plan 
is 
compliant 
with 
state 
aid 
laws.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-warns-job-cuts-cannot-be-ruled-out-after-737-max-delay/Ryanair has 
warned more pilot and cabin crew job losses #8216;cannot be ruled out#8217; after the latest delay in the return to 
service of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft.It comes after Boeing last week admitted it might be July before the MAX fleet 
#8212; grounded globally after two deadly crashes #8212; may be clear to fly again. 
Ryanair had been hoping to take delivery of ten of the aircraft in May or June, ahead of the peak summer season, 
but said in a memo to staff that it will now not be able to receive them until September or October at the earliest. 
That means it is having to #8216;urgently revisit#8217; its summer 2020 schedule, according to the memo #8212; 
which was first seen by the Reuters news agency. #8216;Sadly, this means we cannot rule out further base cuts 
and closures,#8217; it said. #8216;We will do our best to avoid any more base closures, but this will mean 
eliminating at least ten aircraft from existing bases, and so further pilot and cabin crew job losses cannot be ruled 
out.#8217; The memo was sent to staff by Eddie Wilson, chief executive of the Ryanair airline brand which operates 
as part of the wider Ryanair group headed by Michael O'Leary. Mr Wilson said the company would try to advise all 
bases in the first or second week of February #8216;as to what further cuts and/or closures will be required as 
direct result of these further Boeing MAX delivery delays#8217;. #8216;I apologise sincerely for this uncertainty, 
and for any worry it may cause you,#8217; he added. Mr Wilson said the airline would try to minimise outright base 
closures in favour of cuts and reductions in flight frequency. The 737 MAX was grounded last March after 346 
people died in two crashes attributed to anti-stall software. Ryanair has a fleet of more than 450 aircraft and is one 
of the biggest MAX customers, with 210 on order. The group's chief executive said last month that the grounding of 
the fleet was costing it at least €100m (84m) a year. Ryanair has already cut a number of bases over the winter, 
leading to cabin crew and pilot job cuts. Read more: Ryanair warns job cuts #8216;cannot be ruled out' after 737

Ryanair has warned pilots of possible base closures and job cuts as the date for delivery of its first 10 Boeing 737 
MAX jets slipped into the autumn.
In a memo dated Jan. 27 and seen by Reuters, the low-cost airline said that Boeing would not deliver the first of the 
grounded model until September or October at the earliest. Ryanair does not take deliveries during its peak 
summer months of June, July and August.
Ryanair had hoped to have up to 10 of the 737 MAX jets available from June and said in the memo that elimination 
of 10 aircraft from its roster could result in job losses for pilots and cabin crew, as well as possible base closures.
"I have asked our commercial team to work up their proposals for these 10 aircraft reductions in summer 2020, and 
I hope to have their final recommendations over the next week," Chief Executive Eddie Wilson said in the memo.
"We will do our best to avoid any more base closures, but this will mean eliminating at least 10 aircraft from existing 
bases, and so further pilot and cabin crew jobs losses cannot be ruled out."
The 737 MAX, Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft, was grounded last March after 346 people died in two crashes 
attributed to anti-stall software.
Ryanair has a fleet of more than 450 aircraft and is one of the biggest MAX customers, with 210 on order.
The carrier's marketing chief Kenny Jacobs this month said he hoped the 10 aircraft would be delivered in March or 
April, though the timing would be dependent on regulators.

Asked for comment, Ryanair told Reuters it had "nothing further to add to the memo."
Boeing last week said that it did not expect to win approval for the 737 MAX's return to service until the middle of 
the year, having previously given an estimate of March or April. (Reuters)

MINISTERS have brought in advisers to help negotiate a government loan to struggling regional airline Flybe, 
despite insisting the rescue deal will not constitute state aid.
Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) has been tasked with advising the Department for Transport (DfT) in assessing the basis 
for a commercial loan, according to Sky News.
The company, a specialist in corporate restructurings, was involved in talks between Flybe and Whitehall officials 
last week.
Any loan is expected to come to more than £100m.
It comes after Flybe implored regional airports to give it more time to find millions of pounds it owes them in unpaid 
landing fees last week.
Europe's biggest regional airline held crisis talks with airports including Birmingham, Glasgow, Aberdeen and 
Southampton.
This is despite the government deferring a £10m air passenger duty (APD) tax bill earlier this month - on top of the 
£100m loan - to help keep the airline afloat. Sources told the Sunday Telegraph that Flybe, which is backed by 
billionaire Sir Richard Branson, had "got out its begging bowl".
The government's decision to help Flybe enraged rivals including Ryanair and British Airways earlier this month.
British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) filed an official complaint to the European Commission, 
suggesting Flybe had received unfair state aid.

IAG boss Willie Walsh also said the rescue was "a blatant misuse of public funds".
Meanwhile, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary threatened to sue the government over deferring the APD tax bill. He 
demanded the "tax holiday" be extended to the rest of the industry.
But chancellor Sajid Javid last week dismissed the complaints.
He said the agreement to delay the APD payment was a "standard Time to Pay arrangement… because of their 
short-term difficulties".
The DfT declined to comment.

China's leaders are braced for a blow to first-quarter economic growth as the deadly coronavirus weighs on 
consumption, travel and manufacturing, with some cities extending the lunar new year break by nearly a week.
The virus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, has led authorities to cancel events across the country for the 
normally week-long lunar new year period, which started on Saturday.
The financial capital Shanghai has ordered companies not to reopen until February 9, while the manufacturing hub 
of Suzhou, one of the world's largest, has postponed the return to work of millions of labourers for up to a week.
China's banking and insurance regulator announced moves to help businesses affected by the crisis, including a 
lowering of loan interest rates.
The outbreak comes as the country is reporting its lowest rate of economic growth in nearly 30 years. For President 
Xi Jinping the crisis represents another major challenge on top of a popular uprising in Hong Kong, a swine fever 
outbreak that has wiped out millions of pigs and fuelled inflation, and the trade war with the US.

Travel restrictions meant railway transport fell about 42 per cent on Saturday compared with the same day last 
year, according to the transportation ministry. Passenger flights were also down by roughly 42 per cent and overall 
transportation across the country declined about 29 per cent.
"The coronavirus makes a pronounced slowdown even more likely and if the disease is not brought under control 
quickly, then even our downbeat forecasts may turn out to be too high," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China 
economist at Capital Economics.
The Sars epidemic knocked quarterly economic growth down by two percentage points, from 11.1 per cent in the 
first quarter of 2003 to 9.1 per cent in the second quarter. In 2019, the economy grew by just 6.1 per cent.
"This could have a serious impact on consumption," said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University 
and senior fellow at Carnegie-Tsinghua Center. "People are not going out to restaurants and bars."
Airlines Shares in carriers in Asia, Europe and the US fell almost across the board yesterday. Air France-KLM, one 
of a number of European carriers with significant Chinese exposure, shed 7 per cent by mid-afternoon in Europe. 
BAowner IAG fell 6 per cent, while Germany's Lufthansa was down 5 per cent.
Even airlines with no exposure to China came under pressure on fears that a drop-off in passengers could 
reverberate globally. EasyJet slipped 5 per cent, while Ryanair was down 3 per cent.
Automobiles Consumers are likely to delay car purchases, analysts warned yesterday, while several auto 
executives said a reliance on parts suppliers from the Hubei region may prevent some plants reopening following 
the new year holiday. Wuhan is a major automotive hub, with plants from Nissan, PSA, Honda, General Motors, 
Geely and Renault, as well as a range of auto parts suppliers.
Banking Credit Suisse sent its staff in Hong Kong a memo instructing them to work from home and not come into its 
headquarters in the International Commerce Center tower if they have visited the mainland in the past 14 days.
Fellow Swiss bank UBS told its 2,500 Hong Kong workforce to stay at home if they have travelled to China recently. 
The lender, which also has 1,200 employees in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, has set up an "internal 
pandemic website", but all its offices remain open, according to a spokesman.
HSBC staff have been told not to come into the office until February 3, the date when the Chinese lunar new year 
has been extended to by the government.
Consumer Starbucks closed stores in Wuhan and McDonald's has suspended its business in Wuhan and 
surrounding cities where public transport has been closed. Heightened food safety measures were being rolled out 
at the company's operations across the country.
Matthew DiFrisco, analyst at Guggenheim Securities, estimated China accounted for about a tenth of Starbucks' 
sales.
Leisure There was no official fireworks to mark Chinese new year in Macau yesterday as the world's largest 
gambling hub cancelled all its celebrations.
Figures from the tourist office show that the number of tourists from mainland China fell by 80 per cent on Sunday 
compared to the same day last year.
The $5.5bn Disneyland park in Shanghai was closed, as was its theme park in Hong Kong. The National Museum 
of China, Forbidden City, Beijing's Olympic Stadium and parts of the Great Wall of China were also closed.
Luxury Chinese customers now account for over a third of the value of luxury goods purchases, according to Bain 
&Co. consultants, leaving groups such as LVMH, Kering, HermÈs and Burberry exposed to a health crisis likely to 
weigh on Chinese demand and curtail travel.

So far brands have managed to weather the sales drop from the Hong Kong protests because many of the 
purchases were repatriated from the island to mainland China, or elsewhere in Asia. The coronavirus could change 
all that.
"Not only will Chinese people buy less domestically during the key new year shopping season, they will also have to 
cancel trips abroad, during which they often buy luxury goods," said Joëlle de Montgolfier, director of Bain's luxury 
practice. "Recently announced restrictions on travel could have real consequences for the sector."

China's leaders are braced for a blow to first-quarter economic growth as the deadly coronavirus weighs on 
consumption, travel and manufacturing, with some cities extending the lunar new year break by nearly a week.
The virus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, has led authorities to cancel events across the country for the 
normally week-long lunar new year period, which started on Saturday.
The financial capital Shanghai has ordered companies not to reopen until February 9, while the manufacturing hub 
of Suzhou, one of the world's largest, has postponed the return to work of millions of labourers for up to a week.
China's banking and insurance regulator announced moves to help businesses affected by the crisis, including a 
lowering of loan interest rates.
The outbreak comes as the country is reporting its lowest rate of economic growth in nearly 30 years. For President 
Xi Jinping the crisis represents another major challenge on top of a popular uprising in Hong Kong, a swine fever 
outbreak that has wiped out millions of pigs and fuelled inflation, and the trade war with the US.

Travel restrictions meant railway transport fell about 42 per cent on Saturday compared with the same day last 
year, according to the transportation ministry. Passenger flights were also down by roughly 42 per cent and overall 
transportation across the country declined about 29 per cent.
"The coronavirus makes a pronounced slowdown even more likely and if the disease is not brought under control 
quickly, then even our downbeat forecasts may turn out to be too high," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China 
economist at Capital Economics.
The Sars epidemic knocked quarterly economic growth down by two percentage points, from 11.1 per cent in the 
first quarter of 2003 to 9.1 per cent in the second quarter. In 2019, the economy grew by just 6.1 per cent.
"This could have a serious impact on consumption," said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University 
and senior fellow at Carnegie-Tsinghua Center. "People are not going out to restaurants and bars."
Airlines Shares in carriers in Asia, Europe and the US fell almost across the board yesterday. Air France-KLM, one 
of a number of European carriers with significant Chinese exposure, shed 7 per cent by mid-afternoon in Europe.

 Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) has warned its pilots of potential base closure and job 
reductions due to the protracted grounding of Boeing's 737 Max jet, Reuters and other media outlets reported 
Tuesday, citing an internal memo dated Jan. 27.
Ryanair had hoped to have up to 10 of jets available from June, but it does not expect Boeing to deliver the first of 
the grounded model until September or October at the earliest, according to reports.
"I have asked our commercial team to work up their proposals for these 10 aircraft reductions in summer 2020, and 
I hope to have their final recommendations over the next week," CEO Eddie Wilson was quoted as saying in the 
memo.
Last July Ryanair said it had 500 more pilots than it needed, in part due to the Max delays, but it hasn't said how 
many jobs it has cut to date.

Jan 28, 2020( Medical Xpress: http://medicalxpress.com Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing 737-700 jet airliner. Credit: 
Wikipedia/Arcturu Alan J. Hunter from Oregon Health & Science University was a passenger on a recent airline 
flight when he responded to a flight attendant's request for a "doctor on board." The flight attendant suspected that 
a young male passenger was having a stroke, which would require an emergency landing. 
However, upon examination, the physician made an unusual diagnosis. The case report is published in Annals of 
Internal Medicine. A medical emergency[1] during a commercial airline flight may require an unplanned landing, 
which disrupts travel plans and is very costly. Therefore, it is important to know the difference between a true 
medical emergency and something that does not require an unplanned aircraft landing. Dr. Hunter found the plane 
passenger suffering from sudden-onset ear pain, slurred speech, drooling, and complete right-sided facial droop. 
The man had lost his forehead wrinkles and could not close his right eye, but had no mental symptoms[2] and still 
had his physical strength. When the man reported that he had recently recovered from a cold and that his 
symptoms began during ascent, Dr. Hunter determined that there was no reason to deter the plane. The man's 
symptoms were caused by declining atmospheric pressure[3] in the cabin causing a relative increase in middle ear 
pressure from a blocked Eustachian tube that was transmitted to the branches of the seventh nerve as they ran 
through his middle ear. According to Dr. Hunter, this condition is described as facial barotrauma. It occurs during 
ascent in scuba divers[4] and infrequently while flying, during land travel at high altitudes, after certain operations 
on the middle ear, and with some structural disorders of the middle ear. The paralysis usually resolves within 15 to 
30 minutes after maneuvers to reduce middle ear pressure, such as yawning, swallowing with pinched nostrils, and 
the Valsalva maneuver. Breathing oxygen-enriched air improves tissue oxygenation, which also helps. Explore

FLYBE is said to have implored airports to give it more time to find millions of pounds it owes them in unpaid 
landing fees.
Europe's biggest regional airline held crisis talks with airports including Birmingham, Glasgow, Aberdeen and 
Southampton, according to reports.
This is despite the government deferring a £10m air passenger duty tax bill earlier this month to help keep the 
airline afloat.
Sources told the Sunday Telegraph that Flybe, which is backed by billionaire Sir Richard Branson, had "got out its 
begging bowl".
Chief executive Mark Anderson held talks with the airports.
Insiders added that most are inclined to support the airline. However, deferrals could be damaging to their own 
finances, as Flybe is one of the biggest players in their market.
Companies House filings showed the airline has also effectively mortgaged assets such as its engines and 
buildings to Global Loans Agency Services.
Previous clients include Thomas Cook, Interserve and Carillion in the weeks before they went bust.
A Birmingham airport spokesperson said: "Flybe is an important carrier to us and the midlands region but we do not 
comment on commercial terms concerning any of our airlines."

The government's decision to save Flybe sparked considerable backlash among its competitors.
Ryanair and British Airways both suggested it had been given favourable treatment.

Highlight: The big only get bigger and the small eventually disappear; air travel fares may be set to increase due to 
consolidation.
Body
With the recent news of Flybe's near-collapse, the European airline market is set to mirror the US, where four major 
airlines dominate, holding nearly 50% market share in 2019 according to GlobalData. In Europe, Ryanair, Easyjet, 
Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines held 32% of the market share. Dominated by low-cost airlines, consolidation has 
already begun. 
Flybe is set to rebrand as Virgin Connect in 2020, and IAG now owns nine subsidiaries. Collapsed airlines such as 
Monarch and recently Thomas Cook battled direct competitor routes dominated by larger airlines, most of which 
now hold a monopoly. This has been shown by recent reports of EasyJet benefitting from Thomas Cook's demise, 
where they reported their passenger numbers have increased by 2.8%, with revenues up by almost 10% in the Q4 
2019. Consolidation may provide more sustainable growthRising operating and technology costs mean that airline 
carriers are unable to generate a sustainable profit to reinvest into areas such as innovation and technology. TUI's 
Chief, Friedrich Joussen, among others, highlighted overcapacity in the market and has called for airline 
consolidation, emphasizing the high levels of competitive pressure. Even though jobs and recognized brands will be 
lost if consolidation continues, it is the answer to more sustainable growth in this market. European carriers will be 
able to benefit from larger-scale operations, offer enhanced benefits to passengers and add to ongoing viability. 
The potential end of cheap fares on air travelLow-cost airlines have driven fares down on certain routes, making it 
easier than ever for individuals to travel abroad. This positions a problem for mid-tier airlines such as Norwegian, 
making it harder for these companies to maintain competitiveness and return a profit. Competition is the reason why 
consumers are able to take advantage of lower fares. If larger carriers plan to acquire smaller, failing ones, the 
need to drive down the price will no longer exist. This could result in an increase in fares, potentially leading to a 
decline in airline travel.

 Flybe's owners are seeking 100 million pounds sterling ($130.6 million) worth of short-term loan from the UK 
government, BBC News reported Friday, citing sources.
Connect Airways also agreed to funnel an extra 20 million pounds into its troubled regional airline, the report said. 
The amount is in addition to the 30 million pounds already promised to save the company.
The news came after British Airways' owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.L) filed a complaint to 
the European Union, claiming that Flybe's rescue violates state aid rules. EasyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair (RYA.L) 
also said taxpayer funds should not be used to save a rival company.

Jan 25, 2020( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
number of passengers taking domestic German flights has fallen for the second year in a row. The industry says the 
drop is not due to environmental concerns despite a Swedish campaign of flight shaming or flygskam.For the 
second year in a row, the number of passengers on German domestic flights has declined, according to data from 
the German Airports Association (ADV), as reported by the news service Tagesschau on Saturday.The number of 
domestic passengers in 2019 fell by 1.9% from the year before to 47.1 million. 
In 2018, passenger figures fell by 0.8%Figures have dropped continually since August last year, the association 
said. Read more: To fly or not to fly? The environmental cost of air travelThe number of passengers on domestic 
flights in 2019 was just 1% greater than the figures from a decade ago.Meager growth internationallyThe number of 
passengers on international connecting flights was up, though growth has slowed.Last year, 244.3 million 
passengers made international connections in Germany, an increase of 1.5% over the year before, the slowest 
growth in six years.The ADV said a strike by Germanwings pilots at the end of 2019 was partly responsible for the 
low figures. Higher costs and greater competition also played a role, they said. Some airlines, like Easyjet, Ryanair, 
and Eurowings, reduced the number of flights offered last year. A slowing global economy and high oil prices also 
had an effect.Not due to 'flight shaming'The ADV said the drop in passengers was not related to increased concern 
over the link between climate change and CO2 emissions from flying or so-called flight shaming."Negative 
influences are growing," the association had said in December, referring to troubles within the industry and global 
economic trends. The German Aviation Association (BDL) told DW there were two reasons for the drop in domestic 
passenger demand."The first is the cooling global economy — declining global trade and trade conflicts. Secondly, 
the insolvencies of Germania and Air Berlin," BDL said in a statement, adding excess capacity from both airlines 
had been withdrawn from the market.Read more: Next time you fly for vacation, buy your right to polluteFrankfurt 
Airport reported the greatest number of total passengers of any German airport last year, serving just over 70 
million, followed by the airports in Munich, Dusseldorf, and Berlin-Tegel.Every evening, DW sends out a selection of

Chancellor Sajid Javid will today write to Ryanair to dismiss the airline's threat of legal action against the 
government's rescue of Flybe. Javid is expected to tell Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary that the government's 
proposed package of measures to aid the ailing regional Flybe did not constitute state aid, Sky News reported. 
Treasury officials are said to be frustrated over perceptions that the state loan amounted to a bailout.

Everyone Hates Spirit Airlines, How Is It Making So Much Money?[1] #8212; Marker by Medium Good read on 
Spirit. I keep waiting for the airline to do something playful with Trevor Noah the same way Arby's did with Jon 
Stewart back in the day. Separately, I love Ben Baldanza's quote #8216;Businesses that look at what people say 
don't do as well as businesses that look at what people actually do.#8217; Truth. After years of design and testing, 
it's almost time to fly. The #777X[2] will make its first flight as early as January 23, subject to weather and other 
factors. Learn more about the airplane:

2020[5] Image of the Week: If all goes well, this bad boy is going to be taking to the skies today. It would have been 
yesterday if not for bad weather. Boeing could use any kind of good news at this point. Two for the roadThe return 
of the legendary US airline you've probably never heard of[6] #8212; CNN Travel Well if that doesn't make me feel 
old. I've flew the old Eastern as a kid, and I have absolutely no affinity for the brand. I've written this up before. No 
airline is a good name to bring back, but Eastern especially does not have a positive connotation, and I'm not sure it 
ever really did. Its founder was stingy, and well, in the end, things got worse.Newsletter:Some pricing trickery from 
JetBlue[7] #8212; Los Angeles Times I find myself wanting to agree with David Lazarus most of the time, but in the 
end I rarely do. In this case, he starts off strong. JetBlue raising the bag fee to $35 and then calling it a consumer 
benefit is the worst kind of PR attempt. And bag fees have the potential of becoming outrageously high, just like 
change fees. But then he loses me. The solution is for businesses to offer a single, all-inclusive price for goods and 
services.That's how they do it across the Atlantic. The European Union says consumers #8216;have to be clearly 
informed about the total price, including all taxes and additional charges.#8217; In other words, the price you see 
listed is the price you pay.Hmm, someone should probably tell Ryanair, easyJet, and Wizz about that. It's just 
completely not true. Bag fees are good, and a la carte structures benefit those who don't need everything when 
they fly. But that doesn't mean airlines can't go too far.Get Posts via Email When They Go Live or in a Weekly

"Competition is a sin!" railed oil tycoon John D Rockefeller. He thought business was best conducted without pesky 
rivals. One fewer for low-cost European airline easyJet is certainly proving beneficial. Revenue per seat rose almost 
9 per cent in the three months to December, helped by the collapse of rival Thomas Cook in September. EasyJet 
shares yesterday rose as much as 5 per cent.
EasyJet, which favours Airbuses, is also benefiting from the misery of rivals that own grounded Boeing 737 Max 
aircraft. This is putting a cap on capacity growth expectations, including Ryanair. That could mean a chance to grab 
market share if demand is as "robust" as easyJet claims.
EasyJet thinks capacity will rise 3 per cent this year, faster than the sector. Ryanair hopes to achieve similar 
growth. That depends on it receiving 10 new 737 Max jets in the summer. The odds of this are lengthening as more 
problems with the Max emerge.
Easing back on the throttle and cruising might be a better option for easyJet. The Brexit uncertainty that hit last 
year's trading may have passed. The event itself could still involve nasty turbulence. Peter Bellew, who recently 
joined from Ryanair as chief operating officer, should focus his attention on costs. At easyJet, expenses excluding 
fuel have been rising twice as fast as those at its thriftier www.rival.No opportunity to boost operating margins 
should be overlooked. They were 7 per cent at easyJet last year, with Ryanair's at 12 per cent. Each percentage 
point would have added £63m to last year's bottom line.
EasyJet could be forgiven for privately rejoicing in the downfall or discomfort of its foes. In business, no one gets a 
prize for being a good sportsman. But the advantage tends to be temporary, as illustrated by the fillip Dixons 
EasyJet / Ryanair : vice report

In the past week regional aviation has seen both highs and lows - highlighting just how challenging a sector this can 
be as well as the opportunities to be optimistic.
In the UK, regional airline Flybe (soon to become Virgin Connect) faced uncertainty as it tried to secure a future. 
The airline negotiated a rescue deal with the government and shareholders, with Lucien Farrell, chairman of 
Connect Airways, commenting on the recognition of the "importance of Flybe to communities and businesses 
across the UK".
The government also confirmed it would be reviewing Air Passenger Duty (APD) "to ensure regional connectivity is 
strengthened while meeting the UK's climate change commitments to meet net zero by 2050." The UK's APD is the 
highest European aviation tax for both short-haul and long-haul flights.
The rescue deal was criticised by several industry executives, however, including Ryanair's Michael O'Leary who 
called for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to "extend the APD eco tax 'holiday' given to Flybe, to all of its UK airline 
competitors."
He said the bailout is "in breach of both Competition and State Aid laws," and argued that the Flybe model is not 
viable: "because it cannot compete with lower fare services from UK regional airports on domestic and EU routes 
provided by Ryanair, easyJet, BA and others; and it cannot compete with lower cost road and rail alternatives on 
many smaller UK domestic routes."
Despite this, we can be sure the announcement that Flybe will continue to operate as normal would have been 
welcome news to its 2,400+ employees.
Elsewhere, airlines have been showing their dedication to enhancing regional connectivity, as low-fare leisure 
carrier Allegiant announced its largest service expansion in company history. Most of the 44 new routes announced 
by the airline are non-competitive, with no other airline providing service between those airports.
Reasons to be cheerful?
Meanwhile in north Germany, Lübeck Airport is anticipating the return of scheduled services later in 2020 as it 
prepares to launch a new regional airline, Lübeck Air. The airline will use an ATR 72-500 to connect the city to 
Munich and Stuttgart.
Scheduled services at the airport ceased in 2016 and so the launch of Lübeck Air will bring commercial services to 
the airport once again.
The LARA team will be making some journeys of its own this week to attend Airfinance Journal Dublin. Please get 
in touch if you would like to arrange a meeting or keep an eye out for our team at the show!

 Flybe said it agreed to a payment plan for a debt of less than 10 million pounds sterling ($13 million), dismissing 
reports that it received a payment holiday of up to 100 million pounds from the UK government, BBC News reported 
Friday.
The troubled regional airline said the arrangement would be for a "matter of months" before the tax and duties are 
paid off, according to the report.
The statement comes after Flybe's rivals International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.L) and Ryanair Holdings 
(RYA.L) filed complaints about the government's compliance with state aid rules. Flybe shareholders on Jan. 14 
agreed to funnel more money into the company alongside a UK government bailout package, which reportedly 
involved the deferral of a tax bill.

Jan 20, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Momentum investing 
revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be 
essentially be "buying high, but hoping to sell even higher." With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a 
stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. 
The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though 
momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and 
worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores[1], helps 
address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ryanair (RYAAY), which currently has a Momentum Style Score 
of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings 
estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock 
rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ryanair currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 
(Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of 
A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank 
Stocks here >>>[2]Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if RYAAY is a promising momentum pick, let's examine 
some Momentum Style elements to see if this airline holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look 
at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the 
upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a 
particular area.For RYAAY, shares are up 9.67% over the past week while the Zacks Transportation - Airline 
industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly 
price change of 5.59% compares favorably with the industry's 0.27% performance as well.Considering longer term 
price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past 
quarter, shares of Ryanair have risen 25.19%, and are up 36.46% in the last year. In comparison, the S...00 has 
only moved 11.51% and 28.5%, respectively.Investors should also take note of RYAAY's average 20-day trading 
volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume 
baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above 
average volume is typically bearish. Right now, RYAAY is averaging 311,678 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings 
OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price 
changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can 
What Makes Ryanair ( RYAAY ) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?
help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with RYAAY.Over the past two months, 3 earnings 
estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost RYAAY's 
consensus estimate, increasing from $4.39 to $4.92 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates 
have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven 
these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that RYAAY is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. 
If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Ryanair on your short 
list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks

Don't be distracted by BB 's shiny night train to Brussels - the problems of EU-wide rail run far deeper

Jan 20, 2020( Jon Worth: http://www.jonworth.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Hey journalists! I'm glad to see you're 
writing about trains! BB running its first NightJet to Brussels seems to have got you into a particular frenzy. It's 
amazing what a bit of red carpet at Gare du Midi, and Martin Selmayr on board[1], can do to generate a bit of 
interest, eh?
 But you see that with all your 'oooh look night trains are nice!' you're right where the Austrian Railways, BB, wants 
you. 'Shiny train! It's green!' Ooooh, gushing story[2]. Netherlands is subsidising the reintroduction of night trains[3], 
and BB - with its twice weekly service to Brussels with an awful timetable (arriving 10.55am) - is making a similar 
political pitch to the EU. We are the good guys, subsidise things like this. At least BB has an international view. But 
competition in rail, perhaps not that. The basic thing you have to remember about most railway firms is this: the total 
number of passengers travelling by rail in Europe is not of concern to them. Yes, you read that right. They do not 
care about the total numbers of people travelling by rail. The focus is instead on maintaining their share in a 
national market. We want to keep our passengers on our trains. And anyone else trespassing on our patch is a 
danger to us. Have you ever wondered why there as many DB InterCity trains (7 a day) in Germany to Norddeich 
Mole[4] (population 1837, yes fewer than 2000 people live there) as there are daily DB ICEs (also 7) to Brussels (a 
pretty important capital)? Or why SNCF created its low cost brand OUIGO[5] - a completely owned subsidiary, it's 
like a Ryanair train, if it gets cancelled you cannot take a regular TGV. But yeah it's still 'service public' and any 
rivals can be kept out of the French market. Both of these cases are because maintaining national position is more 
important than actually increasing the numbers of passengers on trains. There would be another way to solve the 
lack of night trains in Europe problem than getting governments to subsidise services, as BB would like. It would be 
to solve the track access charges (the fee each train pays per kilometre) problem - making it cheaper to run trains 
at night when anyway the networks are emptier. But if you are, say, SNCF Infra[6], do you you want the Austrians 
running trains on your lines? No. Because were customers to get a taste for it, the next time they might choose to 
take a BB train from Strasbourg to Paris rather than a SNCF one. Or - shock of shocks - perhaps a private rival like 
Flixtrain[7] or Leo Express[8] might see a market the state operators have vacated[9], and seek to fill that void. 
Letting someone else in means letting everyone in. Oh and what about back in Austria? WESTbahn is a rival to BB 
on the Wien - Linz - Salzburg route oh, and that firm is 26% owned by French state operator SNCF[10]. Or in other 
words precisely what would benefit BB in Netherlands or in France to run there, is exactly the thing they fear back in 
Don't be distracted by BB 's shiny night train to Brussels - the problems of EU-wide rail run far deeper
their own national market. So there is the rub. That is why booking trains cross-border is a pain (as my recent BE-
FR[11] and BE-NL[12] cases have shown). That's why passenger rights in the absence of through tickets has not 
been solved in the EU. That's why there is still no reliable and complete database of all trains running in the EU. 
Solving each of those things would help maximise the numbers of people taking the train. But all of those things 
would likewise endanger the national position of rail companies like SNCF or BB, or NS, SNCB or Deutsche Bahn. 
And he who lobbies hardest wins the argument, and what better way to do that than put on a nice shiny night train 
from Vienna to Brussels and have Karima Delli (chair of the EP Transport Committee), Martin Selmayr (formerly 
Juncker's chief of staff, now head of the Commission Rep in Vienna), Michel Reimon (Austrian Green MEP) and 
Othmar Karas (Austrian VP MEP) on board? And don't worry, SNCF, Deutsche Bahn, NS or SNCB, we're the good 
guys, a state railway from Austria, so if the EU can provide us a nice little subsidy, and politicians can get their shiny 
night train (even one every day of the week), everyone is happy, right? Well, probably not. Because the real 
deficiency - that no operator really has a strong incentive to improve rail's market share overall - remains 
unchanged. The post Don't be distracted by BB's shiny night train to Brussels - the problems of EU-wide rail run far 
deeper[13] appeared first on Jon Worth Euroblog[14]. [ 1]: https://twitter.com/eszterz/status/1219196287964340225

In the past 10 years, Flybe has had four chief executives, undergone multiple restructurings and come close to 
collapse three times.
This week the new owners of the UK regional airline, Connect Airways - a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart 
Group and Cyrus Capital - were handed another chance to revive the carrier's fortunes after a last-ditch rescue by 
the government.
But as rivals launched legal challenges to the support, many in the industry have questioned the future of Flybe, 
which runs more domestic services in the UK than any other carrier.
"Under many different guises over the last 20 years ... the Flybe model has lurched from reconstruction to 
reconstruction and has never been profitable or viable," Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, wrote in a 
letter to Sajid Javid, Chancellor, on Thursday.
Since it took over officially in July, Connect Airways has made some headway in trimming Flybe's network. It has 
cut almost 45 per cent of flights from its domestic Winter schedule compared to last winter, according to data from 
OAG.
State rescue will not fly, say Flybe rivals Airlines. Domestic services ; Legal challenges launched as sector 
participants raise big doubts over carrier's viabi....
That was not enough to prevent Flybe last weekend lurching into a situation when its owners were considering 
whether it should let the airline enter administration after ploughing £110m into the carrier largely to support its cash 
flow. It raises the question of how long the £30m capital injection Flybe's owners have promised as part of the 
government's deal will last.
The size of its fleet is a problem. Previous management ordered too many aircraft. Many believe it needs to trim its 
network and slim down. None of this sits comfortably with the government's justification for keeping Flybe operating: 
helping maintain easy UK connections.
Filling planes is a hurdle. The airline's load factor has typically hovered between 61 per cent and 75 per cent over 
the past decade, much lower than that at easyJet and Ryanair.
Flybe has argued that the high cost of air passenger duty suppresses demand: as a domestic airline, it was hit hard 
by the tax as passengers would be charged the short-haul duty cost - £13 - twice as they depart from two UK 
airports.
Virgin, one of Flybe's owners, knows well the challenge of turning regional flying in the UK into a profitable 
business. Virgin has long searched for a way to feed passengers to its long-haul flights from Heathrow and 
Manchester after it lost transfer traffic when IAG bought BMI from Lufthansa in 2012.
The same year Virgin acquired a package of slots at Heathrow for domestic flights, setting up its Little Red 
subsidiary, with the aim of securing a network of routes from around the UK to feed long-haul business. But severe 
losses saw Little Red close in 2015.
Revamping Flybe's UK network may run into the competing interests of the groups that make up Connect Airways. 
Stobart Group, which, like Virgin, owns 30 per cent of Flybe, has made clear that it wants to use the carrier to help 
grow Southend Airport, which it owns. In November, the airline said it would fly to 10 destinations from Southend 
from the summer, which is expected to see an additional 500,000 passengers travel annually through the airport.
Toscafund this week took an 18 per cent stake in Stobart because of the group's Southend goals. "We believe that 
if management are successful as they plan then Southend would be worth at least £1bn within three years," said 
Martin Hughes, Toscafund founder.
One tailwind for Flybe could come from the government's review of regional connectivity. It could recommend a rise 
in the number of routes subsidised through the EU's public service obligation scheme. Flybe runs just one of these 
routes: Newquay to Gatwick.
Aviation analysts believe expanding the number of routes it subsidises would be a better way for the government to 
keep the UK's regions connected, while recognising that profitability is likely to prove elusive on many of the routes 
that are vital to smaller communities.
"If the government wants to ensure regional connectivity from smaller cities, some type of PSO structure should be 
established that allows regional airlines to tender for contracts in an environment where they can ensure a modest 
profit," said John Grant of OAG. Additional reporting by Laurence Fletcher Heavy duty Special treatment criticism 
brushed aside Flybe has rebutted claims it is receiving special treatment on its air passenger duty after a backlash 
from rivals over its government rescue package.
The airline said it had agreed a payment plan with HM Revenue & Customs for less than £10m, rather than its 
entire annual air passenger duty bill of around £106m.
"This agreement will only last a matter of months before all taxes and duties are paid in full," Flybe said. "This is a 
standard Time to Pay arrangement with HMRC that any business in financial difficulties may use."
The government and Flybe confirmed earlier in the week that only some of the company's APD would be deferred, 
but until now refused to put a figure on the sum.
State rescue will not fly, say Flybe rivals Airlines. Domestic services ; Legal challenges launched as sector 
participants raise big doubts over carrier's viabi....
On Thursday, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary threatened to sue the UK government over its rescue deal for Flybe. 
IAG, which owns British Airways, has filed a complaint to the EU over state aid concerns. Tanya Powley

Flybe's oversized fleet is a problem, but the need to trim the network sits uncomfortably with ministers' declared 
priority of keeping easy connections in the UK - Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg

Ryanair boss joins condemnation of UK bailout of Flybe
Ryanair boss joins condemnation of UK bailout of Flybe

The boss of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has attacked the UK government-backed rescue of regional airline Flybe, 
joining industry heavyweight Willie Walsh in opposing state help for a private company.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said on Thursday he had written to finance minister Sajid Javid, calling on him to 
extend the same benefits to his airline as it has given to Flybe.
Flybe was kept afloat on Tuesday after its shareholders agreed to invest more money alongside a UK government 
support plan, but details of that support have not been made public. Media reports say it involves the deferral of a 
passenger tax (APD) bill and a potential government loan.
The British government has defended the rescue deal and said it is fully compliant with state aid rules.
Walsh, the head of the parent company of British Airways , has complained about the rescue and filed a complaint 
with the EU saying that help for Flybe constituted a breach of state aid rules.
O'Leary said Flybe should not be singled out for help.
"This government bailout of the billionaire-owned Flybe is in breach of both competition and state aid laws," he said 
in a statement, adding that any holiday Flybe had been given from APD should be extended across the industry.
Flybe is owned by Connect Airways, a consortium created by Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and investment adviser 
Cyrus Capital. (Reuters)

O MUCH for open government.
SIt shouldn't be too much to expect the ministry responsible for the public finances to disclose the potential liability 
to taxpayers of a private company bailout.
Yet in the Treasury's statement about the government-backed rescue of the regional airline Flybe this week, there 
was scant detail and even fewer numbers.
True, one of the main components of the deal, a state loan on commercial terms, has yet to be finalised.
That fact alone suggests the triumphalist tone of tweets by Andrea Leadsom and Grant Shapps - the business and 
transport secretaries - proclaiming that Flybe's future had been salvaged was premature.
With a key financial lifeline yet to be agreed, ministers risk being acutely embarrassed if such a tentative deal 
unravels.
Also missing from the Treasury's announcement was confirmation of HMRC's consent for Flybe to defer elements 
of its tax bill. Instead, a promise to review the air passenger duty regime relating to domestic flights in March's 
Budget was the only meaningful measure referred to in the statement.
Let's be clear, though - a review or two of government policy (Shapps has also pledged unspecified measures to 
bolster regional connectivity) would on their own not have been enough to bring Flybe back from the brink.
Flybe rescue secrecy is absurd
As I reported on Sky News on Sunday evening, the Big Four accountancy firm EY was on standby to handle an 
administration of the company. Without further financial support, that risk remains real, even after the injection of 
£30m by the consortium which owns it.
The three shareholders in Flybe's parent Connect Airways have had mixed feelings for several months about 
substantial new investment, after seeing an initial £100m debt and equity injection since taking ownership fail to 
address the airline's challenges. In truth, the alliance between Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital 
Partners always looked an unstable one.
Legal protests lodged by rival airlines such as IAG, the owner of British Airways, make the declaration of victory 
even riskier. Yesterday, Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary added his combative voice to those opposing Flybe's 
statebacked rescue. He has threatened to sue the government if the Treasury fails to answer key questions about 
the arrangements within seven days.
While O'Leary and Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, risk painting themselves as corporate bullies if their 
interventions lead to the rescue collapsing, they have a point. The Treasury should publish full details of the 
proposed deal - the current obfuscation is an insult to www.taxpayers.NO TIME TO CHARGE FEES The title of 
Daniel Craig's final outing as 007, No Time To Die, might equally apply to the character's favourite car maker. Aston 
Martin Lagonda has had a licence to kill investors' enthusiasm for its shares since it floated in London little more 
than a year ago.
The stock price is down by more than three-quarters. This week, analysts at Jefferies argued that the company now 
needs to raise as much as £500m in fresh equity.
One piece of reassuring news is that Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire Formula 1 team-owner, is close to agreeing a 
deal to invest £200m in return for a 20 per cent stake.
One question will be how the company intends to get around the issue of pre-emption - a central tenet of UK equity 
markets. If the investment bankers who advise on the deal are among those who were rewarded handsomely for 
working on Aston Martin's flotation, they should offer to waive their fees.
Like another of Craig's outings, the Spectre of its calamitous IPO will hover over the London market for some time 
to come.
CHISM SCHISM? It's not only ministers who are preparing to leave their desks after next month's Whitehall 
reshuffle. I hear Nick Chism, chief business adviser at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy 
(Beis), is about to step down from the role.
A former KPMG infrastructure partner, Chism led Beis' Brexit readiness events across Britain in recent months. 
Let's hope the department's decision not to replace him isn't a sign of overconfidence.

THE BACKLASH over the government's decision to save Flybe continued to escalate yesterday for the third day 
running, as Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary waded in with a threat to take legal action.
In a strongly worded letter to chancellor Sajid Javid, O'Leary railed against the decision to extend a tax "holiday" to 
the struggling airline, which he declared was "billionaireowned" by virtue of Sir Richard Branson's airline Virgin 
Atlantic having a 30 per cent stake in it.
O'Leary's comments came as Flybe chief Mark Anderson late last night insisted the firm's government loan did not 
amount to a bailout.
"We are in conversation with the government around a financial loan - a loan, not a bailout - a commercial loan, but 
that is the same as any loan we'd take from any bank," Anderson told Flybe staff, the BBC reported.
£CONTINUES ON P3 CONTINUED FROM FRONT PAGE Anderson said Flybe had "legacy issues" to deal with 
that investors were not made aware of when the airline was acquired.
"The reality… is that we were in worse shape than even the shareholders thought we were," he said. The airline 
was acquired in March by a consortium led by Virgin, as well as Stobart Group and private equity firm Cyrus 
Capital.
O'Leary cautioned that rival airlines were already under immense pressure, and that if Flybe failed others would 
have to pick up the slack.
BRACE FOR IMPACT Now O'Leary threatens to sue over Flybe deal Shareholders were in the dark about 
Flybe health, says chief
"This Flybe 'subsidy' cannot comply with competition, or state aid rules unless the same... tax holiday and other 
government subsidies are extended to all other UK competitor airlines," he added.
O'Leary called on Javid to publish the details of the government's deal with Flybe immediately, which was later 
followed by a freedom of information request from BA owner International Airlines Group (IAG).
The government insisted it had not broken state aid rules.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has waded into the furore over the rescue of Flybe, threatening legal 
action against the UK government and denouncing the regional airline's business model.
In a letter to chancellor Sajid Javid, Mr O'Leary said the air passenger duty holiday given to Flybe should be 
extended to all rival carriers in the UK.
"This government-led 'rescue' of the billionaire-owned Flybe is in breach of competition rules, in breach of state aid 
rules, and is an unnecessary misuse of government funds to rescue the failed investment of its billionaire 
shareholders of what has always been a failed business model."
His comments add to a growing backlash against a support package agreed with Westminster on Tuesday.
They followed a statement from Stobart Group, one of Flybe's owners, that said the rescue was required partly 
because of a delay in gaining control of the airline after the acquisition was agreed in January 2019.
Stobart is one of three owners of Flybe, along with Virgin Atlantic and Cyrus Capital, which together form Connect 
Airways.

"The delay in receiving control, coupled with a number of other factors including legacy issues, impacted on the 
delivery of the consortium's turnround plan for Flybe. This resulted in a situation in which a further injection of funds 
is required to ensure continued flying."
Stobart revealed it was contributing up to £9m of a £30m capital injection into Flybe agreed as part of the 
government rescue package. It said the funds would be drawn down only if required. The government agreed a 
short-term deferral of Flybe's air passenger duty - equating to about £106m a year - and a potential loan.
Flybe rivals have lashed out at the rescue plan, saying taxpayers should not be called on to save the ailing 
business.
IAG, which owns British Airways, yesterday said it had submitted a Freedom of Information request to both HM 
Revenue & Customs, and the Department for Transport as it accused the government of a "lack of transparency" on 
its rescue package.
Mr O'Leary added: "The absurd claim by business secretary Andrea Leadsom that the Flybe business model is 
'viable' is baseless."
Stobart Group said: "The Connect Airways consortium has worked tirelessly alongside Flybe and the UK 
government to look for solutions to ensure the financial viability of the airline so that consumers can continue to 
have confidence in flying with Flybe."
This rescue 'is a misuse of government funds to rescue the failed investment of its billionaire shareholders'

O'Leary is not happy  Credits Getty Images Alt Text Ryanair, Michael O'Leary  Irish airline boss Michael O'Leary 
says tax deferral for rival carrier breaches state aid laws  In Depth[1] Gabriel Power[2] Friday, January 17, 2020 - 
11:34am Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is threatening legal action against the UK government for green-lighting a 
controversial rescue package for ailing regional airline Flybe. See related Quiz of The Week: 4 - 10 January 2020[3] 
Flybe has reportedly been offered extra time to pay more than100m of outstanding Air Passenger Duty (APD),a 
move that has angered rival carriers[4], who argue that the duty 'holiday'should be offered to all airlines. O'Leary 
claims the deal - or as he puts it, the 'badly thought-out bailout of a chronically loss-making airline' - is a breach of 
state aid laws, and is insistingthat the Government publish the full details of the agreement for transparency 
purposes.Why is the bailout controversial?
The Government this week approved a rescue package for Flybe, which operates more than half of UK internal 
flights outside London, amid warnings that the carrier was on the brink of collapse[5]. The full details of the last-
minute deal were not published, but reports suggest that the Government deferred Flybe's payment of flight taxes 
totalling 106m until spring - claims that have triggered anger among rival airlines. Officials at the International 
Airlines Group (IAG), which owns brands including British Airways,have already filed a complaint with the European 
Union, arguing the rescue breaches state aid rules, the BBC[6] reports. And now Ryanair CEO O'Leary has waded 
into the row. In a letter of protest to ChancellorSajid Javid, the Irish tycoonargues that the Flybe business modelis 
'neither profitable nor viable, and has lurched from failure to failure repeatedly over the last 20 years'. City 
A.M.[7]says thatO'Leary also 'hit out at Flybe's billionaire shareholders including Sir Richard Branson', claiming that 
this group of wealthy investors'do not need a government subsidy to prop up their failed airline investments'. 'The 
reason why Flybe isn't viable is because it cannot compete with lower-fare services from UK regional airports on 
domestic and EU routes provided by Ryanair, easyjet, BA and others; and it cannot compete with lower cost road 
and rail alternatives on many smaller UK domestic routes,'O'Leary wrote.Why is he threatening to sue?O'Leary 
claimsthat if thetax deferral is confirmed to have been offered to Flybe, the deal would not comply with competition 
or state aid rules unless the same measures are extended to other airlines. The Government has insisted that the 
rescue plan is compliant with state aid laws, but the IAG is seeking to use channels relating to EU Freedom of 
Information laws to uncover the full details of the deal. Meanwhile, Ryanair has taken a more direct approach by 
addressing the UK government directly. 'We've given the Chancellor of the Exchequer seven days,' O'Leary warns 
Why Ryanair is threatening to sue the UK government over Flybe rescue
in his letter. 'If he doesn't publish the deal within seven days or at least extend the same holiday to all of the other 
UK airlines, so that we can pass it on to our customers as well, I think we launch competition law proceedings in the 
UK and state aid proceedings against the UK government for breach of state aid rules in Brussels.'  World News[8]

THE PHILOSOPHY of the market is based on the idea that the key to a prosperous economy is competition. Fair 
and vibrant competition, the argument goes, spurs businesses to improve quality and reduce prices, benefiting 
consumers and fuelling economic growth.
Companies that struggle should be allowed to fail, making room for more agile or innovative rivals that can do a 
better job. The role of the government is not to pick winners or prop up faltering businesses, but rather to make sure 
that the field is level and everyone is playing by the same rules.
This is the traditional turf of the Conservative party, historically home to economic liberals who believe that 
government meddling only serves to distort the business landscape and waste taxpayer money when it could be 
better spent - or, preferably, remain in people's pockets.
A softer form of pro-market liberalism popular among Conservatives holds that there is a role for government in 
supporting business by investing in areas of strategic national importance, such as infrastructure. But such 
investment must make clear economic sense, spurring productivity and innovation rather than protecting incumbent 
players who cannot survive on their own.
The rescue deal this week to save the struggling airline Flybe would therefore have come as a surprise to anyone 
familiar with how Conservatives usually operate. In last-minute talks with shareholders, Flybe has been granted a 
government loan and a £100m temporary tax break to keep its planes in the air.
This deviation from the laws of market economics has not gone unnoticed.
The Flybe bailout flies in the face of market common sense
In addition to the general backlash over taxpayers subsidising an airline whose main shareholders include Virgin 
Atlantic (owned by billionaire Sir Richard Branson), British Airways, which competes with Flybe on some routes, has 
filed an official complaint with the European Commission.
It is ironic that the EU, long held up by eurosceptics as a behemoth of protectionist bureaucracy, is now looking into 
whether the marketoriented UK broke state aid rules that ban distorting competition.
Also pushing for "fair competition" is the Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who has called for all airlines to get a tax 
break like Flybe. It has been noted too that diving in to rescue an airline that exclusively runs short-haul flights, one 
of the highest polluting forms of travel, flies in the face of Boris Johnson's post-election commitment to make Britain 
the "cleanest, greenest" country on www.Earth.No one is in any doubt about why the rules were bent for Flybe. It 
can be summed up in two words: regional connectivity.
Flybe, we have been told ad nauseum this week, may not matter much if you live in London, but the airline is vital to 
the "left behind" places that have been in focus since the election - Birmingham, Manchester, Belfast, the Isle of 
Man, Exeter, or Newquay in Cornwall. Without it, we have been warned that regional airports would collapse, and 
with them the prospects of the communities they serve.
In this topsy-turvy world where the Conservatives are now the party of anywhere outside the M25 and MPs are 
tripping over themselves to talk about "levelling up" the regions, letting Flybe fail wasn't an option. It just didn't fit 
with the messaging that won Johnson the election.
And if the government's priority genuinely is investing in forgotten parts of the UK and building centres of corporate 
gravity outside London, then the move is logical.
Defying both the tenets of market economics and the pressure to focus on environmental sustainability may be 
deemed a price worth paying for the ability to fly direct from Cornwall to Luxembourg or Manchester to Aberdeen.
But if that's the case, the government should be honest with itself and with taxpayers: it doesn't care about curbing 
public spending, cutting taxes, promoting competition, or moving towards a greener economy as much as it cares 
about ensuring that a relatively small group of people in a handful of places of comparatively low national economic 
importance still have an airline.
This a risky and short-termist way to run a country, especially when global headwinds hint of a recession on the 
horizon. With slowing growth in key markets, a still-smouldering US-China trade war, the inescapable disruption of 
Brexit, and the looming threat of climate change to businesses across a range of industries, the UK is going to need 
all the firepower it can muster.
That means taking decisions to maximise productivity and longterm economic sustainability, not handing out cash in 
a panic because allowing a company to fail wasn't in line with the new branding.
Letting Flybe collapse would have been disastrous for a small number of businesses and individuals who rely on it, 
and damaging for the communities it serves. But over time, smarter and more viable transport options would have 
emerged - and if they didn't, the government could have designed a more sustainable investment package, based 
on upgrading rail infrastructure across the country or upskilling people from struggling industries.
In opting instead for a shorttermist subsidy, the government hasn't only jeopardised both the free market traditions 
of the Conservative party and the green credentials of the Prime Minister. It has revealed a set of skewed priorities 
that could leave it poorly equipped when the next crisis strikes.
Letting it fail just didn't fit with the messaging that won the election

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) said on Thursday that the tax exemption given to "billionaire owned" Flybe (FLYB.L) by 
the UK government is in breach of competition and state aid rules unless the same are provided all other UK 
competitor airlines.
The Irish budget airline urged UK Chancellor Sajid Javid to extend the air passenger duty "holiday" to all UK-based 
airlines including Ryanair, easyJet (EZJ.L) and British Airways, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group 
(IAG.L).
Flybe received a pardon late Tuesday after the UK government told the airline it would review air passenger duty. 
Flybe shareholders agreed to additional investment into the airline on the basis of the tax exemption.
Ryanair's shares rose nearly 1%, whereas, easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines Group's share fell about 
1% at the close of market on Thursday.

The impact of the Boeing 737 Max grounding
The impact of the Boeing 737 Max grounding

Jan 16, 2020( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing is the largest manufacturing 
exporter in the US, a major US employer and has a supply chain of thousands of US, European and global 
manufacturers. Before the tragic events described below, the 737 Max had been Boeing's fastest selling aircraft. 
Economists variously estimate that its grounding and production suspension has taken between 0.24 and 0.4 
percentage points per quarter out of US GDP. So, it has been inevitable that this grounding and those production 
cuts have hadfar-reaching effects on aircraft lessors, airlines, manufacturers and the wider economy of the US and 
beyond. 
We consider some of those effects below. Global grounding On 29 October 2018, Lion Air 610 crashed shortly after 
take-off from Jakarta. On 10 March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines 302 crashed shortly after departure from Addis Ababa. 
In response, all aviation authorities around the world soon grounded the 737 Max. Boeing hopes the 737 Max will 
be back in service at some point in Q1 2020, but this looks unlikely, especially given the FAA's recent decision to 
investigate a second potential risk posed by the aircraft. Production cuts After its global grounding, Boeing 
suspended all 737 Max deliveries and reduced production from 52 to 42 per month. Despite this, orders initially 
remained buoyant with positive announcements from the 2019 Paris and Dubai air shows. In Paris, for example, 
International Airlines Group signed a letter of intent to buy 200 737 Max.However, on 16 December 2019, following 
the FAA's decision that it would not approve the aircraft's return to service before 2020, Boeing announced an 
indefinite production halt starting in January 2020. Among other things, this led to an immediate drop in Boeing's 
share price and falls in the share prices of many of Boeing's suppliers, such as Senior, Spirit Aerosystems, GE and 
Safran. Cancelled orders The first announcement of cancellations came on 14 March 2019, when Garuda 
Indonesia cancelled 49 orders for the 737 Max. In June 2019, Azerbaijan Airlines announced that it would postpone 
its order of 10 737 Max. This was followed by Saudi carrier, flyadeal, cancelling its order of 30 737 Max aircraft and 
switching to a new agreement for the same number of Airbus A320 Neo aircraft. Airlines and lease rates The 
grounding led airlines that were operating or awaiting deliveries of the 737 Max to cancel thousands of flights and 
these airlines are taking a cautious approach to including the 737 Max back into their flight schedules. American 
Airlines and Southwest Airlines, for example, have pulled the 737 Max from their operating schedules until 6 April 
2020 and 13 April 2020, respectively. Icelandair and United Airlines have pushed this out to May 2020 and early 
June 2020, respectively. Ryanair has confirmed that it has reduced its expectation of receiving a delivery of 30 737 
Max aircraft before the summer of 2020 to 20 aircraft.In addition, airlines battling lost capacity have extended 
The impact of the Boeing 737 Max grounding
leases, subleased aircraft on a short-term basis, deferred maintenance and reassigned their other aircraft. 
However, these measures seem unlikely to head off the upward trend in lease rates for narrowbody aircraft. The 
costs of flight cancellations and subleasing, which have been enormous, are likely to rise if the 737 Max is unable to 
fly again soon. Lessor assistance It is reported that some lessors have supported their affected airlines with 
temporary rental holidays or deferrals (reportedly with Boeing providing financial assistance directly to some of 
these lessors). Usually, this has been on the basis that the airline will share any compensation it receives from 
Boeing with the lessor or pay higher rentals once the 737 Max is back in service. Compensation In March, 
Norwegian Air became the first airline to publicly demand compensation from Boeing for the costs of the groundings 
of the 737 Max. India's SpiceJet has also announced it will claim compensation from Boeing. It is reported that 
compensation claims have also been submitted by China's Shandong Airlines and China Eastern Airlines and, no 
doubt, other carriers will be privately negotiating compensation packages with Boeing. A number of airlines, such as 
Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Groupo Aeromexico have concluded compensation agreements with 
Boeing for their 2019 losses.The financial impact of the grounding of the 737 Max has also had a more personal 
impact in recent months as American Airlines Group's pilots and the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association are 
currently seeking compensation for lost pay stemming from flights cancelled as a result of the aircraft grounding. 
American Airlines announced that US$30 million of its compensation from Boeing will be shared with employees. 
Litigation Avia Capital Services, a Russian aircraft leasing company which ordered 35 737 Max, is the first customer 
of Boeing to bring a lawsuit against the company. Avia is suing for breach of contract and compensation in the form 
of its cash deposit with interest, as well as a set amount of lost profits. Although the first customer to take this 
action, Avia may not be the last as companies start to question whether the delay in their delivery order could be 
considered an inexcusable delay under the terms of their sale agreement. Most such claims are settled out of court, 
but if any cases go to trial, it will be an interesting test of the enforceability of the extensive exclusion of liability 
clauses usually contained in purchase agreements. Capacity alignment and yield improvements One positive 
outcome from this situation has been a reduction in overcapacity. Prior to the grounding, airline capacity was 
growing faster than traffic, with a number of aviation commentators and lessors calling for the major manufacturers 
to slow the growth on new aircraft deliveries. However, the delivery delays and production cuts to the 737 Max have 
mitigated some of this overcapacity. This has also improved airline yields, particularly in North America. Whether 
these improvements will continue will partly depend on how and when the 737 Max is brought back into service. 
Fleet planning challenges Once the 737 Max regains regulatory approval, the shortage of narrowbody aircraft in the 
market could continue. Boeing currently has approximately 400 aircraft in storage and says it will need six to seven 
months to deliver those aircraft, based on an optimistic 60-70 aircraft a month delivery target. However, some 
industry commentators are sceptical about this timetable and have suggested it will take Boeing up to three years to 
restore the 737 Max to full service. Airlines will need to consider more long-term solutions in their fleet planning. 
Fear of flying The biggest hurdle for the aircraft may be overcoming public fears of flying on it. One plan to 
counteract these fears is to run many flights without passengers, but carrying senior Boeing airline executives. It 
has also been announced that Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines are planning to hold 
hundreds of demonstration flights to try to convince passengers that the aircraft is safe. Ryanair has announced 
that it will be re-branding its 737 Max aircraft. It may not be the only airline to take this approach. Whether any of 
these approaches will win over the public in significant numbers remains to be seen.

Jan 17, 2020( Coolsmartphone: http://www.coolsmartphone.com Delivered by Newstex)  With Christmas and the 
entire festive season just a dim and distant memory now, people are planning to escape the dark, cold and wet 
winter nights by booking a summer holiday. After getting the right deal, you've got to consider saving the money to 
pay for it all and planning things out so that you make the most of your time there.For me, I'm useless at all that. I'll 
not save enough, then I'll end up putting everything on the credit card and miss half of the interesting sights and 
tourist spots because I didn't do any preparation. Saving For me, I use the Moneybox app. They have two types of 
account - one for saving and one for investing. You can put a regular amount in or round-up your purchases and 
add cash that way. The only thing you will have to keep an eye on is the lead-time that needs to be considered 
when you decide to take money out. Right now, the 95-day saving account is the one I'm using, but I obviously 
need to give at least three months notice to get that cash out again.

Other 
options include 'Digit', which will help you save money and will help you to straighten out your finances after the big 
festive splurge. It'll create savings goals ahead of your holiday and you can watch as that money starts to stack up 
without it encroaching on your daily life too much. You can also look at 'Piggy Goals', 'Savings Tracker' and 'Money 
Manager'. There's a lot out there and, for me, it's the daily or weekly on-screen reports that really give me a boost.

With travel companies like Thomas Cook vanishing, many are now constructing their own holidays. A cheap Easyjet 
or Ryanair flight, then a hotel or Airbnb booked separately - it's easily done and you can use apps like TripAdvisor 
to plan your holiday, get ideas for restaurants, tours and attractions. As an example, if you're planning to go a bit 
further afield, and you like your meat, you can search for that. Brisket, baby back ribs, chicken and pulled pork, 
there is a wide choice available. Whilst searching, I found that Grandview Las Vegas[1] did all this, delivering WiFi, 
a 
kitchen, 
hot 
tubs 
and 
more

reviews. It'll compare prices on resorts and cruises too. There's so much here that it's a great way to plan out what 
activities you'll be interested in. You can book them in advance too, so you know it's all done and dusted. Other 
worthy apps include 'Guides by Lonely Planet', 'TripIt' and Expedia. You can also check out hotels via apps such as

 The UK government defended a rescue plan for troubled regional airline Flybe after its rivals filed complaints over 
state aid concerns, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. 
The spokesman said the government is fully compliant with state aid rules, adding that it stepped in to restore 
transport links between the UK regions, according to the report. He also said the government would only give 
support on "strictly commercial terms."
British Airways' owner IAG (IAG.L) said it wrote to the European Commission on Wednesday morning, accusing the 
government of breaching state aid rules, London's Financial Times reported the same day. Ryanair Holdings 
(RYA.L) also told UK Chancellor Sajid Javid that cutting air passenger duty for all domestic flights in order to help 
Flybe would "constitute unlawful state aid" to the airlines operating on those routes, the publication added.
Flybe shareholders on Tuesday agreed to funnel more money into the company alongside a UK government bailout 
package. The deal reportedly involved the deferral of a tax bill.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has confirmed it has sacked more than 200 employees as it closes three bases in the 
Canary Islands, a number that is nonetheless fewer than the 512 positions unions had feared would be lost, the 
news agency AFP reported. Darrell Hughes, the carrier's director of human resources, said during a press 
conference in Madrid that the dismissals only included pilots and cabin crew. Ryanair revealed in August that it 
would close its bases at Las Palmas, Lanzarote, and Tenerife Sur airports as well as one on the mainland, in 
Girona, which the Spanish union USO warned could result in a total of 512 lost jobs.

Highlight: Public outrage may be sparked in the future, matching private sector outrage, if the airline eventually 
falls into administration
Body
Ministers have agreed to work with Flybe to devise a repayment plan for a significant tax debt, thought to be valued 
at around Â£100m. Airline and rail rivals have strongly protested this decision. Backlash from the public may 
present itself further down the line if the airline goes bust. Taxpayers will argue that they should not be used to bail 
out individual companies that are backed by multinational corporations, especially those owned by billionaires. 
If it turns out a percentage of tax contributions has been allocated to a failed airline, this could cause many people 
to lose confidence in the UK taxation system. Public distaste may discourage governments from helping in future 
cases that could be classed as more deserving. A short-term correction may not fix key underlying issuesA key part 
of the rescue deal which has been discussed widely is the cut on Flybe's Air Passenger Duty (APD) payments. 
Flybe's focus on domestic travel has meant that an increase in APD payments has been problematic. However, a 
range of deeper-lying issues have contributed more significantly to Flybe's downward trajectory. Key problems for 
Flybe include that it suffers from the lack of a hub airport and its destinations are made up of an extremely 
disintegrated network of low-frequency flights. Flybe's main competitors EasyJet and Ryanair both have hub 
airports at London Gatwick and Stanstead respectively. Possessing hub airports means that these competitors can 
increase flight frequency to more destinations. Serving a wide range of travellers on a mass scale allows the cost 
per seat to be brought down, which means that Flybe's cost per seat is higher in comparison. Customer loyalty is 
difficult to attain for Flybe in a market, which is hypersensitive to changes in price. Stakeholders need to agree on 
routes to scale back onSmaller, domestic routes will be likely to be sacrificed first, particularly if they aren't 
subsidized due to the social benefit they bring. However, competing rail links are improving in southwest England. 
New rail timetables introduced in recent months have significantly improved services from Devon to London which 
has decreased demand. The supposed plans of Flybe morphing into Virgin Connect in early 2020 look increasingly 
at risk as investors scrutinize the profitability of the company.

Flybe's rivals have lashed out at the government's rescue of the regional airline, saying taxpayers should not be 
called on to save the ailing business as British Airways' owner IAG filed a complaint to the EU based on state aid 
rules.
Within hours of agreeing a package to support Flybe, Boris Johnson's government was accused of giving 
preferential treatment to Flybe to keep crucial regional routes open.
IAG said it had written to the European Commission yesterday highlighting its concern that the rescue of Flybe 
breached state aid rules. Ryanair has also written a letter to Sajid Javid, the chancellor, warning him that any move 
to help Flybe by cutting air passenger duty for all domestic flights - and not international flights - would "constitute 
unlawful state aid" to the airlines operating on those routes.
The government agreed a multiprong rescue deal on Tuesday for Flybe, including a short-term deferral of some of 
its APD, which costs the airline about £106m a year, and a potential public loan. Under the terms of the agreement, 
Flybe's owner, Connect Airways - a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and Cyrus Capital - will inject £30m 
into the airline over the coming months.
The government also pledged to review APD for all UK carriers.
Willie Walsh, IAG's outgoing chief executive, blasted ministers' support for Flybe as a "blatant misuse of public 
funds", saying taxpayers were picking up the bill for mismanagement of the airline.
IAG files complaint to Brussels over Flybe rescue as rivals rail at 'state aid'
Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said: "Taxpayers should not be used to bail out individual companies, 
especially when they are backed by well-funded businesses."
Eoin Kealy, head of competition and regulatory at Ryanair, wrote: "We trust that the UK government will not act in a 
manner that unlawfully favours a financially profligate airline over other airlines that offer UK passengers low fares 
and reliable service."
The European Commission said it was ready to discuss with the UK the "compatibility of proposed public measures 
with EU state aid rules". The UK has to follow EU rules on state aid after Brexit at least until the end of the year.
Downing Street said: "There has been no state aid for Flybe."

IAG, owner of British Airways, filed a complaint to the European Commission yesterday over concerns that a rescue
