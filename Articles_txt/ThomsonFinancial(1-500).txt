14:40GMT 31Oct2008-Emerging stocks may rally -Merrill
-----------------------------------------------------
MSCI emerging equities could recover to levels around 850 seen just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 
mid-September, Merrill Lynch says, after the index rallied a record 20 percent this week to 567.
Reasons include a doubling in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, cuts in global interest rates, a fall in emerging 
market money market rates and emerging market indexes 'at historic oversold levels,' says Michael Hartnett, ML's 
global emerging markets equity strategist, in a client note.
Despite this week's rally, the index is set for its worst monthly performance in October since the Russian crisis of 
Aug. 1998.

Ryanair 's Italy base plan trades on Alitalia woes
Ryanair's Italy base plan trades on Alitalia woes

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will open two new bases in Italy in March next year, it said on Tuesday, expanding 
further in its second-largest market and capitalising on the woes of bankrupt national airline Alitalia.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said it would open bases in the Sardinian cities of Alghero and Cagliari to ply eight 
domestic and 11 international routes. It also plans to increase daily flights on the lucrative Rome-Milan route to five.
That comes as a government-backed Italian investor group tries to relaunch Italy's flagship carrier Alitalia by 
merging its best assets with those of smaller rival Air One.
'Ryanair is continuing to grow in Italy even as Alitalia and Air One merge and offer fewer flights and higher fares,' 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told a news conference.
He confirmed Ryanair -- which filed a complaint with the European Commission to block Alitalia's investor bailout -- 
had submitted its interest in any Rome or Milan slots that could be shed by Alitalia as part of its restructuring.
O'Leary, who has repeatedly criticised Alitalia for high fares and inefficient service, said he did not expect Alitalia's 
latest rescue to be successful without mass layoffs.
Ryanair will have a total of seven bases in Italy after the latest additions.
O'Leary said he expected Ryanair to carry more passengers than those carried by Alitalia domestically within two 
years.
Mocking the 'I love Italy, I fly Alitalia' slogan coined by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi while campaigning for 
national elections in April, Ryanair unveiled its own version of the phrase: 'Love Italy, Fly Ryanair'.

Irish air travel tax a blow to tourism - industry
Irish air travel tax a blow to tourism - industry

Ireland's move to introduce a 10 euro ($14) air travel tax will hurt the competitiveness of the country's travel and 
tourism sector at a time of already tough business conditions, business groups said on Tuesday.
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan announced the move in his 2009 budget on Tuesday in a bid to shore up state 
coffers as Ireland slides into its first recession in 25 years.
Lenihan said it is estimated the tax, which will take effect from the end of March, will yield 95 million euros in state 
revenues next year and 150 million euros in a full year.
'It would be regrettable even in normal times, but its imposition at a time when the aviation and travel industries are 
in the most precarious position in living memory is unfortunate and unwise,' said Eamonn McKeon, Chief Executive 
of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.
'It is another blow against Ireland's competitiveness and for the amount of money raised it could and should have 
been avoided,' he said.
Lenihan said passengers will pay a lower rate of two euros on shorter journeys, adding that the decision was 
consistent with moves by other European Union member states such as the UK and the Netherlands.
'This new tax will further damage already falling consumer demand for air travel and will put Ireland at a significant 
disadvantage for inbound tourism on which thousands depend for their livelihood,' airline Aer Lingus said.
Shares in the national carrier finished down nearly 2 percent while the main index closed 2.73 percent up.
Aer Lingus's local rival, European low cost carrier Ryanair, had already urged the government this week not to 
introduce a travel tax, saying that it would discriminate against air travellers in favour of ferry passengers.
It added that short-haul traffic from Shannon in southern Ireland could collapse as a result. Aer Lingus pulled its 
services from Shannon earlier this year over the issue of costs.
'Ryanair simply cannot deliver up to 2 million passengers annually at Shannon if the average fares paid by these -- 
mainly -- visitor numbers is to be increased by more than 100 percent,' it said.
Separately, motorists are expected to be hit by increases in motor tax rates.

The tax on cars with engines below 2.5 litres will be raised by 4 percent, while vehicles with bigger engines will see 
a 5 percent tax rise.
But Lenihan also said he would be proposing a tax incentive to promote cycling to work.

Ryanair CEO says may help set up long-haul carrier
Ryanair CEO says may help set up long-haul carrier

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday he may help create a sister company to launch a long-
haul, low-cost airline, if cheap aircraft became available next year.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, would not invest in the new airline but Ryanair shareholders including 
himself may be invited to participate, O'Leary said.
'If aircraft fleet prices collapse, it is a real possibility,' O'Leary told reporters in London.
'There may be the opportunity to buy a fleet of long-haul aircraft cheaply next year,' he said, adding that a collapse 
of a carrier may create the opportunity for such an order, which would then take a further 18 months to deliver.
Dozen of airlines have gone bankrupt worldwide, hit by a combination of high oil prices and faltering economies, but 
analysts see Dublin-based Ryanair's position strong as its costs are lower and cash reserves higher than most 
peers.
O'Leary said there would be no direct connection between the two airlines except that the long-haul one may want 
to use Ryanair's European bases as hubs.
O'Leary has said in the past he was looking into plans for a no-frills transatlantic airline, without providing any 
details.
He reiterated that Ryanair expected to break even for the current year if oil stayed at $100 per barrel and yields, or 
average ticket prices, fell by 5 percent.
Ryanair remained unhedged for its fuel needs for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, O'Leary said.

Europe's largest low fare airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. said passenger traffic rose 20 percent in September while 
load factor fell one percentage point compared to figures for the same month last year.
Passenger traffic increased to 5.23 million from 4.35 million while load factor fell to 84 percent from 85 percent the 
same month last year.
'A lot of price sensitive leisure passengers have switched from rival, high fares airlines, to Ryanair. However, in light 
of the current crisis in banking and financial institutions we are confident that we will soon seen more bankers 
migrate to Ryanair also,' Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said in a statement.

Irish low cost carrier Ryanair <RYA.L> said on Thursday it had filed a complaint with the European Commission 
over an Italian investor bailout of Italy's national airline Alitalia.
Earlier this week unions agreed to back a deal with Italian consortium CAI, which briefly withdrew its offer over 
labour opposition.
'The Italian government is writing off up to 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in Alitalia debts and is guaranteeing the 
investments by the members of the consortium and underwriting huge concessions to the unions in exchange for 
their agreement to these ludicrous plans,' said Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's director of legal and regulatory affairs in a 
statement.

British airline easyJet could add new Italian routes at short notice in the event of the total collapse of Alitalia -- 
although it would expect to be awarded airport slots in return.
A spokesman for the low-cost carrier told Reuters on Tuesday that it could commit around ten aircraft on routes 
such as Milan-Rome, Milan-Naples and Milan-Palermo.
'EasyJet is prepared, at very short notice, to move into routes the Italian government cares about most ... We could 
commit in the region of ten aircraft,' the spokesman said.
Italy's loss-making national airline Alitalia has been sticking to its flight schedules despite the prospect of losing its 
operating licence in just a few days, unless the special administrator comes up with a credible new offer or cost-
cutting plan by Thursday [ID:nLN485696].
However, easyJet said it would not wish to buy Alitalia's vacant slots in the event of its collapse, but would expect to 
be awarded them by the Italian government in return for a swift resumption of service.
'To operate on that route (Milan-Rome) easyJet would need to be given slots. If so, we would operate a number of 
routes per day,' the spokesman said.
EasyJet's arch rival Ryanair, which also has a significant presence on domestic Italian routes, declined to comment 
on its plans.
Alitalia also operates ten flights a day from London's Heathrow, but easyJet said it had no plans to start operations 
from the UK's busiest airport.
British Airways, which has by far the most slots at Heathrow, with over 40 percent of the airport's total availability, 
would not comment specifically on Alitalia but said it would look at opportunities to expand its portfolio.
'We are always looking for opportunities to increase our slot portfolio at Heathrow,' a spokesman told Reuters.

Ryanair remains unhedged for its fuel needs beyond the end of this year and believes that oil prices will resume 
their recent downward path after a record one-day rise on Monday.
Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar also told reporters at a news conference in London that Europe's biggest 
budget airline planned to ground 14 aircraft at London's Stansted airport this winter as it grapples with fuel costs 
and weakening consumer demand. Last year it mothballed seven aircraft based at the airport.
'We're heading into recession and people are becoming much more price sensitive. Our experience of recession is 
that fares generally fall,' Millar said.
'We are already seeing signs of this ourselves despite a reduction in capacity. People are more price sensitive and 
carriers will struggle to fill their seats unless they reduce fares.'

ZURICH, Sept 19 (Reuters) - A vaccine produced by Novartis induces a protective antibody level against diverse

Novartis said the study conducted by Britain's Leicester University showed that its MF59-adjuvanted booster 
vaccine triggers an immune response to the H5N1 strain of bird flu, which experts say could trigger a human flu 
pandemic.

FRANKFURT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank pumped 25 billion euros ($35.5 billion) into

Bulgaria creates 4 bln euro energy giant
SOFIA, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Bulgaria on Thursday merged its biggest energy companies into a 4 billion euro holding

---------------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Irish low-cost airline Ryanair are up more than 6.5 percent as the carrier says it will return to 'substantial 
profitability' next year if the price of oil continues to fall.
'It's true that the financial model bounces back providing oil stays at these levels,' says Collins Stewart analysts 
Andrew Fitchie, referring to previous Ryanair forecasts for losses based on a higher oil price.

Shares in Severfield Rowen gain 5.7 percent to 271.5 pence as RBS repeats its 'buy' rating, while cutting its target 
price to 315 pence from 431 after updating its model and forecasts in the wake of the firm's recent interim results, 
released on August 27.
RBS says it believes the construction engineering group made good progress in the first half and it has left its full 
year 2008 pretax profit estimates unchanged at 50 million pounds.
However, RBS say it has reduced its full year 2009 and 2010 forecasts to factor in a margin decline given the 
potential impact of further softening in the UK markets and the impact of offsetting this with more overseas work.
RBS concludes that while an investment in Severfield is not without risk, it believes the shares still offer value and 
feels overseas joint venture's could be an interesting opportunity for the group.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Shares in British Airways are down nearly 10 percent as investors fret over the twin threats of a fall in business 
class passengers caused by the financial crisis and a 1.5 billion pound pension deficit, analysts say.
'The shares may be affected by the financial meltdown -- around 50 percent of BA's corporate contracts are related 
to financial services, accountancy and law,' says Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Andrew Lobbenberg, although BA 
would not comment on its exposure to particular sectors.
BA said earlier its pension deficit at the end of March was 1.5 billion pounds ($2.74 billion), a snap-shot a 
spokesman says reflects 'weakness in the markets, the poor performance of equities and high interest rates'.

Britain's FTSE 100 index is seen opening 6 to 7 points lower on Thursday, financial bookmakers said, after sinking 
to its lowest closing level since May 2005 in the previous session.
The UK benchmark, however, was expected to fare better than Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 as traders 
said the proposed takeover of HBOS by Lloyds would help ease investor jitters.
'The fact that one bank in the UK that was at risk of having serious problems was HBOS. Now the that fact Lloyds is 
taking over obviously calm the nerves,' said Matthew Buckland, a dealer at CMC Markets.
A person familiar with the matter said Lloyds has agreed to buy HBOS to create a 28 billion pound ($50 billion) 
mortgage company, making it the latest troubled bank to be forced into the arms of a better-funded rival.
Overnight, U.S. stocks dropped to a three-year low as the U.S. rescue of insurer American International Group 
failed to calm a crisis of confidence in global markets and banks were wary of lending to each other. In Asia, 
Japan's Nikkei average fell 2.9 percent.
However, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp, the world's second-largest sovereign fund, said it will 
explore investing in Morgan Stanley if it is approached.
The FTSE 100 closed down 113.2 points, or 2.3 percent at 4,912.4 on Wednesday, extending its losses for the 
week to 9.3 percent, as investors fretted that a global credit crisis would claim more victims after Lehman Brothers 
failed and insurer AIG had to be bailed out.
* Bank fears, AIG fallout drive Wall St sell-off * Nikkei at 3-year low, hit by global credit fears * Dollar drops vs euro 
and yen on US bank fears * Oil near $96 on equity rout, US crude stock fall * Gold in negative territory as buying 
withers
UK stocks to watch on Thursday are:
HSBC
The London-based bank has been cited as a possible buyer of U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley, broadcaster 
CNBC reported.
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND
UK Stocks -- Factors to watch on Sept 18
Royal Bank of Scotland is facing between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion in claims against bankrupt U.S. investment 
bank Lehman Brothers, an RBS lawyer said in a court hearing on Wednesday.
BARCLAYS
Barclays is one step closer to acquiring Lehman Brothers' core U.S. business in a $1.75 billion deal, after a U.S. 
judge approved bid procedures for the sale on Wednesday.
ROYAL DUTCH SHELL
The Anglo-Dutch oil firm has reached deals with six institutes to carry out research into renewable energy sourced 
from biomass, Shell Executive Vice-President Graeme Sweeney said on Wednesday.
KINGFISHER
The retailer is due to issue its first half results.
RYANAIR
The airline is due to hold its AGM.
INVESTEC

Sept 17 (Reuters) - Greece said on Wednesday it would close Olympic Airlines and relaunch it as a private 
company, ending years of wrangling with Brussels over the loss-making state airline.
Following is a snapshot of ailing European airlines:
ALITALIA
- Once a symbol of Italy's post-war boom, flag carrier Alitalia sought bankruptcy protection on Aug. 29, after nearly 
two years of seeking a buyer.
- It loses more than 2 million euros a day and had nearly 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in debt as of July.
- Has for years suffered from political interference, labour disputes and financial woes. The Italian government has 
a 49.9 percent stake.
- Alitalia's bankruptcy commissioner warned on Wednesday the airline was running out of cash for fuel and flights 
could be grounded.
XL LEISURE GROUP
- Britain's third largest package holiday operator XL Leisure Group grounded all flights last Friday after going into 
administration, leaving tens of thousands of holidaymakers stranded. XL said it had been unable to obtain fresh 
funding after suffering from high fuel prices and the economic downturn.
- XL Airways flew to over 50 destinations and carried 2.3 million passengers last year. It had 1,700 staff worldwide.
* SAS
- In August, Scandinavian airline SAS outlined fresh cost cuts and revenue measures in an attempt to stem losses. 
The airline -- half-owned by Sweden, Norway and Denmark -- reported a pre-tax loss of 106 million Swedish crowns 
($17 million) in the second quarter. In June, it abandoned plans to sell its loss-making Spanair unit due to tough 
market conditions. Last week, Germany's Lufthansa said it was in talks to buy SAS.
* SPANAIR
FACTBOX-Airline industry woes in Europe
- SAS-owned Spanair announced it was slashing a third of its workforce when on Aug. 20 a Spanair MD-82 crashed 
on take-off at Madrid's Barajas airport, killing 154 people on board. In May, Iberia pulled out of the bidding process, 
citing worsening sector conditions.
* FALLING PROFITS
- The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said global airlines are set to post losses of $5.2 billion this 
year and $4.1 billion in 2009 as high oil prices and a global financial crisis weigh.
- IATA estimates higher crude prices will add $91 billion to the global airline fuel bill.
- Air France-KLM, the world's biggest airline by sales, announced on Aug 5 its first-quarter net profit more than 
halved to 168 million euros ($262 million).
- Days before, British Airways reported an 88 percent crash in first-quarter profit in what the airline called the worst-
ever trading conditions.
- Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, posted an 85 percent fall in profit at the end of July and warned of a full-
year loss if oil prices stayed high.
- Iberia posted a 3.9 million euro operating loss in the second quarter versus a 56.8 million euro profit a year earlier.

The European Union is set to give its green light for the closure of Greek carrier Olympic Airlines and will fine it 800 
million euros ($1.12 billion) for illegal state aid, daily Imerisia reported on Tuesday.
The EU Commission will meet this week to approve a Greek government plan to shut down the ailing airline and 
transfer its assets to a new entity called Pantheon, the newspaper said without citing sources.
The EU will fine Olympic over illegal state aid during 2005-2007, after competitors Ryanair and Aegean claimed the 
government was continuing to provide assistance in breach of EU state aid rules, it said.
No one at Olympic was immediately available for comment.
According to the plan, the new carrier will eventually take on the Olympic name and hold on to its most valuable 
landing slots. It will only be about 65 percent of the carrier's current size, and about 8,000 employees will be fired or 
transferred.
The new carrier's international flights will be drastically cut, with the plan set to be completed by early 2009, the 
paper reported.
Greece has tried and failed over years to find a buyer for the loss-making carrier. The government has said it may 
either find a buyer or re-establish the airline as a new entity by the end of 2008.
The commission first ruled in 1996 that Greece was in breach of EU state aid rules and ordered Olympic to pay 
back hundreds of millions of euros it received in the 1990s.

12:46GMT 16Sept2008-European airlines rise on falling oil price
---------------------------------------------------------------
Shares of airline companies rise on the falling oil price, with Germany's Lufthansa up 1.7 percent, Britain's easyJet 
up 3.6 percent and Ireland's Ryanair up 1.1 percent.
'Airline shares are up due to the falling oil but also the exchange rate -- in the past the falling oil has been 
neutralised by the strengthening dollar, but this past week the two trends have been more in favour,' says an 
analyst on condition of anonymity.
'The oil price is falling but the fuel surchange remains, which has to be positive for a company's earnings situation,' 
adds a Frankfurt-based trader.
Oil falls to $92 a barrel, while the dollar steadies near 4-month lows versus the yen. For more double click on

Shares in John Wood Group and AMEC down 6.7 and 5.5 percent respectively in tandem with a weaker crude price 
and after RBS highlights worries that at current levels key Canadian oil sands projects could be uneconomic.
RBS says several UK fund managers and environmental groups will meet on Tuesday for the UK Social Investment 
Forum to discuss the financial and environmental risks of Canadian oil sands.
The broker says with oil sands projects highly energy intensive, the meeting will campaign against plans for oil 
sands investment on environmental and financial grounds.
RBS says AMEC and Wood Group are the main UK stocks with exposure to the Canadian oil sands project which 
represent 9-10 percent of AMEC's group revenues and 4-5 percent of Wood Group's revenues.

10:46 GMT 16Sept2008-Swiss Re falls sharply on AIG fallout fears
----------------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Europe's second-largest reinsurance company Swiss Re fall more than 8 percent on fears it could suffer 
because of troubles faced by U.S. insurance giant American International Group.
AIG, thrown a $20 billion lifeline by New York state, comes under renewed pressure as ratings agencies downgrade 
the insurer's debt and the financial sector meltdown spread. Fears that AIG, once the world's largest insurer by 
market value, could be the next financial giant to tumble fuel worries about the potential fallout.
'On one hand Hurricane Ike in the United States caused a lot of damage, on the other hand the latest negative 
reports from the financial sector -- especially about AIG -- weighed (on Swiss Re shares),' analysts at Swiss private 
bank Maerki Baumann & Co, say in a note.
Swiss Re declines to comment on AIG exposure.
But shares in sector number one Munich Re pare early losses after it says it has no significant exposure to AIG. Its 
shares are down 1.9 percent.
The DJ Stoxx European insurer index falls 3.6 percent.

Shares in Ferrexpo jump as much as 6.3 percent, outperforming other UK-listed miners which are all in negative 
territory, after the Ukrainian iron ore producer says it has bought 19.4 million of its own shares as part of its share 
repurchase programme.
'They bought 19 million of their own shares back and that perceives to be very good news,' a London-based trader 
says. 'They have a dire performance of late.'
Ferrexpo is up 0.4 percent at 1021 GMT. The stock has lost 34 percent so far this month after falling 10.9 percent 
last month and 27 percent in July.

Game Group shares fall as much as 11 percent to a 6-month low of 194 pence on concerns the British computer 
games retailer will be hit by cut-price competition from the likes of Morrison and Woolworths, as well as profit taking

'This is a stock that's done pretty well and it's also held widely by U.S. fund managers,' says Altium Securities 
analyst David O'Brien, who expects the shares to go below his price target of 200 pence before bouncing back.
Shore Capital's John Stevenson thinks 2008 will prove the peak of the current computer games cycle, but also

---------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Fidessa Group drop 5 percent after Panmure Gordon downgrades the trading platform systems group to 
'hold' from 'buy' and cuts its estimates and price target.
Panmure Gordons says failed U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers accounts for 2 percent of Fidessa's revenue.
The broker says Fidessa has many revenue drivers which remain intact, but it has long argued that information 
technology being late stage is not immune to the credit crunch and investors need to be mindful of this for 2009 
forecasts more than 2008.
Panmure Gordon says it has cut its 2009 forecasts by 10 percent to 26.1 million pounds to account for fewer 
software sales, price pressure on data service and poorer consultant utilisation. The broker also reduces its target 
price to 908 pence from 1,056 pence.

Shares in Eleco fall 6.5 percent on the group's cautious outlook, despite the building systems and software group 
posting a 40 percent rise in full year pretax profits.
'Trading conditions will be tough this year. However, we will apply the same measured and positive approach to our 
business in the year ahead, albeit against a backdrop of increasingly difficult market conditions,' says John 
Ketteley, executive chairman of Eleco.
Broker Collins Stewart says: 'Uncertainty across end user markets will weigh on sentiment and potentially 
performance, but on current forecasts the shares look cheap.' It retains its 'buy' recommendation and 117 pence 
target price.
The broker says the results are solid in difficult market conditions and makes upgrades to its 2008/09 estimates.

Ryanair delays new routes due to Boeing strike
Ryanair delays new routes due to Boeing strike

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has delayed 11 new routes blaming a machinist strike at planemaker Boeing which 
has caused the indefinite delay of two new aircraft.
The company said on Tuesday the launch of new routes between Scottish capital Edinburgh and a range of 
destinations from Bournemouth in the UK to Lodz in Poland would be delayed by six weeks to November 5.
Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said two new 737-800 planes had been ordered to fly on these routes, but 
would not arrive on time due to the Boeing strike.
'Passengers who were booked to travel on our new routes during this initial six week period will be refunded over 
the next seven days,' he said in a statement.
The strike by 27,000 Boeing machinists threatens to cost the world's top-selling planemaker $100 million a day and 
affect suppliers around the globe. Ryanair is among the first to announce disruption, but more may follow 
depending on the length of the strike, which is into its fourth day.
A Ryanair spokesman said the airline was currently reviewing how the strike would affect other deliveries. New 
routes set to be launched later this year include Liverpool in the UK to Paris, and London Stansted to Agadir, in 
Morocco.
He added the group could launch the Edinburgh routes in November regardless of how the strike develops because 
the firm was freeing up aircraft by closing routes for the winter.

Ryanair Holdings Plc. said it has won the right Tuesday to challenge the award of the Public Service Obligation 
(PSO) subsidy on the Knock - Dublin route to Aer Arann.
The European low-cost airline said it is seeking an explanation of why its offer of a smaller subsidy, lower fares and 
triple the passenger numbers for the Knock route was rejected in favour of Aer Arann's larger subsidy, higher fares 
and fewer passenger numbers.
The High Court in Ireland has granted Ryanair's application for a judicial review of the decision of the Department of 
Transport following the unlawful award of a PSO contract for the Dublin to Knock route to Aer Arann, after Cityjet 
said it would not serve the route.

European stocks sag on eurozone economic jitters

European share prices retreated on Wednesday, ending at their lowest closing level in a week, as weak economic 
data for the euro zone fuelled fears of a recession in the region.
The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares closed 1.5 percent lower at 1,181.90 points.
Data showed that falling investment and private consumption led to the first ever quarterly contraction in the euro 
zone economy from April to June, while July retail sales and August services sentiment signalled more weakness 
ahead.
Tech and consumer-related shares lost ground, dragged down by worries over the euro zone outlook.
Nokia <NOK1V.HE> fell 4.6 percent, LVMH <LVMH.PA> lost 3.1 percent, Unilever <ULVR.L> dropped 3.4 percent 
and Danone <DANO.PA> shed 4.4 percent.
'The economic environment remains gloomy, especially in the euro zone where we're getting a flow of negative 
news. The euro zone is suffering more from the U.S. downturn than people had initially thought,' said Romain 
Boscher, head of equity management at Groupama Asset Management, in Paris.
'Economic indicators come in either in line with expectations -- but expectations are already for a recession -- or 
worse than forecast, like in the case of retail sales or investment levels.'
News of the demise of a hedge fund partly owned by Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers <LEH.N> rattled investors 
and weighed on banking shares.
BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> fell 1.3 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> shed 1.9 percent and Bank of Ireland 
<BKIR.I> lost 2.4 percent.
Airline stocks were among the biggest losers, surrendering some of their recent lofty gains sparked by the drop in 
oil prices.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday the global airline industry is set to post 
losses of $5.2 billion this year and $4.1 billion in 2009 as high oil prices take their toll.
British Airways <BAY.L> dropped 3.9 percent, Ryanair <RYA.I> fell 4.2 percent and Air France-KLM <AIRF.PA> 
shed 1 percent.
European stocks sag on eurozone economic jitters
Energy shares also got hit, falling along with crude oil prices. Repsol <REP.MC> fell 1.2 percent and Total 
<TOTF.PA> lost 2.3 percent.
Miners also took a beating, despite mixed metal prices. Rio Tinto <RIO.L> lost 4.7 percent and Anglo American 
<AAL.L> shed 3.3 percent.
Investors were also bracing themselves for interest rate decisions by both the Bank of England and the European 
Central Bank, due on Thursday.
Although the ECB is expected to keep the benchmark borrowing cost at 4.25 percent, the focus will be on remarks 
by President Jean-Claude Trichet that could give clues on the outlook for rates.
'We're expecting the status quo. Despite the recent sharp drop in commodity prices the central bank could remain 
very cautious, also because the recent fall in the euro versus the dollar is not helping the inflation outlook,' Boscher 
said.
The weak euro zone data released on Wednesday sent the euro currency <EUR=> sinking to a new eight-month 
low against the U.S. dollar.
'Conditions have undoubtedly worsened considerably in recent months,' BNP Paribas economists wrote in a note.
'Several factors undermined eurozone activity, including the deteriorating external environment, the strength of the 
euro, the surge in oil and food prices and last, but not least, the tightening of monetary and credit conditions.'
The FTSEurofirst 300 has lost 22 percent so far this year, hit by inflation and recession fears as well as by the 
impact of a crisis in the credit market on banks' balance sheets.
On the other side of the Atlantic, both the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> and the S&P 500 Index <.SPX> 
have fallen 14 percent so far this year.
Around Europe on Wednesday, Germany's DAX index <.GDAXI> lost 0.8 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> 
shed 2.2 percent and France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> fell 2 percent.
Among the few stocks on the rise, Michelin <MICP.PA> gained 2.3 percent after Credit Suisse raised its rating on 
the French tyre maker's stock, citing improved margin stability and a fall in oil prices. (Editing by Greg Mahlich)

RYANAIR READY TO RENEW AER LINGUS FIGHT AS ECONOMIC PRESSURE GROWS ON EUROPE
Ryanair <RYA.I> is planning to revive an 800 million pound bid for Aer Lingus, after its original move was blocked 
by the European Commission amid fears that the combined group would dominate the Irish market. A Ryanair 
spokesman said: 'We are adopting a wait-and-see approach because there is a lot of consolidation (in European 
aviation) coming and that may force the EU to change its position.' Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus, 
said: 'The competitive landscape has not changed one bit since Ryanair made its first approach.'
PRIVATE EQUITY CONSORTIUM CLOSE TO SECURING FUNDS FOR THREE BILLION POUND INFORMA 
TAKEOVER
Private equity bidders including Providence Equity Partners and Carlyle Group are believed to be close to securing 
financing for a three billion pound acquisition of Informa <INF.L>, the events and exhibitions group. Sources close 
to the deal said the bidders had made excellent progress, although financing was not yet finalised. Analysts at UBS 
wrote in a note: 'This news is positive, as it appears the odds of a deal happening have increased sharply'. Shares 
in Informa closed 14.75 pence up at 440.5 pence on the speculation.
BP'S RUSSIAN VENTURE DENTS CREDIT RATING
Standard & Poor's lowered its corporate credit rating for BP <BP.L> on Monday, citing doubts over the long-term 
ownership of the oil giant's Russian joint venture TNK-BP. S&P cut its rate on BP's corporate debt from AA+ to AA, 
while lowering the long-term rating of BP Finance from AA to AA-. The ratings agency also cited BP's troubles in its 
refining businesses in the US, saying its reassessment reflected 'relative weaknesses that extend beyond the major 
issues at its two largest refineries [in the US]'.

LOGISTICS FIRM GOES INTO ADMINISTRATION
The logistics company Business Direct has been put into administration and on Monday its shares were suspended 
from trading. The company's board announced in a statement late on Friday that it had 'taken advice and concluded 
that the company is no longer in a position to continue its operations'.
GDF SUEZ RULES OUT BE BID, BUT STILL SEEKS NUCLEAR OPTION
The French utility giant GDF Suez <LYOE.PA> has ruled out a bid for British Energy <BGY.L>, but declared its 
interest in the UK nuclear energy market generally. Unveiling the company's interim results on Monday, chairman 
and chief executive Gerard Mestrallet said: 'On British Energy, we are not interested in acquiring the company and 
have stopped all talks.' Mestrallet has previously signalled that GDF Suez is keen on building and running nuclear 
generators in the UK and confirmed on Monday an interest in the British nuclear sector more broadly.

LSE OFFERS INCENTIVES TO BEAT TRADING RIVALS
The London Stock Exchange has redoubled its efforts to fend off rival share trading platforms by launching a new 
system offering traders incentives and lower charges. Three rivals are launching in the coming months offering 
trading in pan-European equities, with Nasdaq OMX Europe and BATS expected to open this autumn. The 
incoming competitor quickest off the block has been Turquoise, which opened for its first full week of operation on 
Monday and is reported to be confident of taking a five percent market share by Christmas.
TNS STILL OPPOSED TO WPP TAKEOVER BID
Taylor Nelson Sofres <TNS.L>, the market research firm, has restated its opposition to a proposed 1.2 billion pound 
takeover by advertising giant WPP <WPP.L>. Sir Martin Sorrell's firm, the only remaining suitor after its rival 
withdrew last week, said it was extending its offer to 12 September and had secured acceptances from 8.6 percent 
of the TNS shareholders. But TNS again urged shareholders to snub the bid, describing the acceptance level as 
'low'.
COORS BREWERS RAISES BEER PRICES FOR SECOND TIME THIS YEAR
Coors Brewers, the UK's second-largest brewer, has become the latest to raise its beer prices in an effort to claw 
back soaring input costs. An earlier four pence a pint uplift for on-trade in February has now been followed with a 
three pence a pint hike effective from 29 September. Chief executive of Coors, Mark Hunter, said: 'We are seeing 
input cost inflation of a magnitude that could cripple the UK beer industry.'

B&B SALES CHIEF QUITS AS CREDIT RATING IS DOWNGRADED
Mark Stevens, sales director at Bradford & Bingley <BB.L>, quit the ailing lender on Monday to become the first 
board member to part company with the buy-to-let specialist since the arrival of new chief executive Richard Pym 
two weeks ago. The news came as Fitch, the credit ratings agency, said the outlook for B&B was negative and 
downgraded its rating to BBB+. 'The weaker revenues driven by narrowing interest spreads and a shrinking loan 
book coincided with worsening bad debts,' said Fitch.
RWE SPENDS SIX MILLION POUNDS ON STAKE IN QUIET REVOLUTION
Quiet Revolution, the British wind turbine maker, is selling a six million pound minority stake to RWE <RWEG.DE>, 
the German company that owns npower. Robert Webb, chief executive of the UK company, said: 'We are delighted

Marks & Spencer <MKS.L> held a three-hour disciplinary hearing on Monday for an employee who blew the whistle 
on plans to cut redundancy pay for the company's staff. The man was represented by the GMB union, which said it 
was expecting a decision on what action he would face in the next few days. M&S told staff last month it was 
planning to reduce redundancy payments and the employee, based at the group's London head office, leaked the 
news to the media. M&S refused to comment, saying it was an internal matter. The employee was suspended from 
his duties pending the disciplinary hearing.

08:20GMT 02Sept2008-Airline stocks surge as oil drops below $106
----------------------------------------------------------------
Shares of airline companies jump as a sharp drop in U.S. crude oil prices <CLc1> further eases worries over fuel 
costs for the sector.
'Airline stocks are very oil-sensitive, so this is really a relief rally,' one trader says.
Air France-KLM <AIRF.PA> is up 5 percent, British Airways <BAY.L> is up 7.5 percent, Ryanair <RIA.I> up 9 
percent and Iberia <IBLA.MC> up 5.8 percent.
Oil plunges to $105.46 a barrel, extending the previous day's rout on signs that a weakened Hurricane Gustav

08:10GMT 2Sept2008-Bulgari up after M.Stanley upgrades to 'overweight'
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Bulgari <BULG.MI> rise more than 4 percent to 7.36 euros, close to a three-month high, after Morgan 
Stanley upgrades the Italian jeweller to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight' with a target price of 7.90 euros.
Morgan Stanley says Bulgari's expected price-to-earnings ratio represents a 23 percent discount to its five-year 
average.
'This presents a buying opportunity in our view,' it says in a note.
'On our revised valuation scenario, we see a highly attractive reward profile, which suggests 13 percent downside 
and 64 percent upside potential to the current share price.'

more catalyst,' a trader says.
The stock had gained around 30 percent since mid-July. It is still down around 60 percent since December 2006.

'Yes, that is the end of the matter for now,' a Commission spokesman said. 'There were no cancellations or

Aer Lingus losses revive Ryanair merger rhetoric
Aer Lingus losses revive Ryanair merger rhetoric

Ryanair <RYA.I> said on Monday that its earlier plans to create a single Irish airline group looked justified after rival 
Aer Lingus <AERL.I> announced last week it would be loss-making into 2009.
Ryanair <RYA.L>, whose bid for Aer Lingus was blocked last year by the European Commission on competition 
grounds, has often complained that in the current wave of European airline mergers it should be allowed to buy the 
former state carrier.
'These half year results from Aer Lingus conclusively supports Ryanair's belief that its 2006 takeover strategy for 
Aer Lingus was the right one,' Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said in a statement on Monday.
Ryanair had promised to reduce Aer Lingus's fares, scrap its fuel surcharges and reduce its costs, he added.
Aer Lingus posted a half-year loss on Thursday hit by record high fuel prices and slowed markets, adding that it 
needed a major cost-cutting programme to remain viable.
Chief Executive Dermot Mannion denied, however, that it had become more vulnerable to a takeover, arguing that it 
was still in a better position than most European short-haul carriers.
Many analysts agree that it has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with more than 800 million euros 
in cash.
Ryanair, which holds more than 29 percent of Aer Lingus shares and nearly three times more cash than its rival, 
said Aer Lingus' 'independence strategy' had failed.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, has said it could also make a small loss this year for the first time since 
1989 as it cuts fares to snatch business from struggling rivals.
'Approximately 25 carriers have failed this year, as fuel costs rose to record highs,' said John Goode, analyst at 
Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin.
'As we leave the summer period behind, and the seasonally high cashflows for airlines that come with it, this list is 
likely to be extended.'
Last week alone, Canadian discount transatlantic carrier Zoom Airlines cancelled all flights and began bankruptcy 
proceedings on Thursday, while Italian national airline Alitalia <AZPIa.MI> sought bankruptcy protection on Friday.

TWO MORE COMPANIES JOIN TAX DEFECTION
British companies Charter <CHTR.L> and Henderson Group <HGI.L> have announced that they are going to move 
their headquarters to Ireland in order to cut their tax and compliance costs. The move has been seen by some as 
significantly increasing the pressure on the Treasury to keep the tax system competitive. Henderson also warned 
that other companies could follow suit. Another four British companies have transferred to Ireland in the last five 
months, highlighting corporate dissatisfaction with the tax system. Heather Self, of professional services group 
Grant Thornton, said: 'There is concern it is at a tipping point'.
PRICE OF HOMES FALLS FOR TENTH MONTH
A new report by Nationwide has revealed that house prices fell for the tenth consecutive month in August, posting 
their largest year-on-year fall in 18 years. The survey found that the price of a typical house has fallen 1.9 percent in 
the month, taking the annual fall to 10.5 percent, the first time that the annual decline in prices has entered into 
double digits since nationwide started collecting data in 1991. Meanwhile, a new survey by the CBI has revealed 
that retailers believe their sales are lower than a year ago, and that many organisations are beginning to cut jobs in 
preparation for tougher times.
REGULATOR REBUKES MOBILE COMPANIES OVER COMPLAINTS
Ofcom has criticised mobile phone operators for having too many dissatisfied customers and offering inadequate 
network coverage. New figures released by the telecoms regulator show that mobile phones are the second most 
complained about product in the economy, with an estimated 1.4 million dissatisfied customers. Ofcom went on to 
highlight an increase in complaints about mis-selling and incorrect billing, along with so-called 'not-spots', areas 
where there is no mobile phone coverage. 'The mobile sector is at a point of change. We need regulation to adapt', 
said Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards.
RYANAIR AND EASYJET FACE THREAT OF NEW ARRIVAL
Thomas Cook <TCG.L> has revealed that it has opened discussions with Tui Travel <TT.L> and Lufthansa 
<LHAG.DE> about a possible merger of their low-cost and charter carriers, a move which, if successful, would see 
a new rival to Ryanair <RYA.I> and EasyJet <EZJ.L> emerge. Tui and Lufthansa have been investigating merger 
options for the last few months in an attempt to rid their balance sheets of non-core aviation assets. News of the 
PRESS DIGEST - Financial Times - August 29
talks comes at a time when soaring fuel costs and worsening economic conditions have forced over 25 airlines 
around the world into bankruptcy.
DIAGEO BRANDS PROVE RESILIENT
Diageo <DGE.L> chief executive Paul Walsh has said that he remains optimistic that sales of the group's whiskies 
and vodkas will remain robust despite the faltering global economy and political turmoil in Russia. Shares in the 
company increased by 20.5 pence to ten pounds at the end of trading on Thursday after Mr Walsh reported a nine 
percent rise in operating profits to 2.3 billion pounds. Diageo also said that despite the credit crunch, it has 
managed to increase the prices it charges for most of its brand, helping lift its US profits by 10 percent and its 
overall sales revenues by five per cent.
STAGECOACH BENEFITS IN SWITCH FROM CAR TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT
Bus and rail company Stagecoach <SGC.L> reported strong trading in the first quarter of its financial year as more 
people moved from private cars to public transport. In its trading update, the company said that in the 16 weeks to 
August 17 its profits grew more quickly than expected thanks to revenue growth in its bus division. Revenue growth 
in the bus business was 9.3 percent, while takings at its US bus operations went up by 7.6 percent.
RETAILERS DEMAND RENTAL FLEXIBILITY
A letter sent to landlords by Sir Philip Green, the owner of BHS and Arcadia, has called for an 'open and honest 
conversation' on the 'archaic' leasing and rent review structure which exists in the United Kingdom. In his letter, Sir 
Philip claims to have the support of 33 fellow retailers, indicating that many are thinking about paying landlords 
monthly rather than quarterly, and want to take on rents without prior agreement. Landlords have previously agreed 
to shift to easier terms when retailers are in danger of running short of cash, but many retailers do not believe that 
the move went far enough.
FALL IN PROPERTY SALES HURTS SAVILLS
The property consultancy Savills <SVS.L> has reported a 41 percent fall in underlying profits to 19.2 million pounds 
due to the decline of the commercial and residential real estate markets. The organisation has stated that it is still 
on track to make 20 million pounds' worth of cost savings in 2008, partly through redundancies. The residential 
market has seen a decline of 45 percent in the past year in London and house prices are predicted to fall by 25 per 
cent between 2008 and 2010.
UPBEAT AMEC IS TAPPING THE BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING
Amec <AMEC.L>, the engineering services company, has reported that booming demand in oil and gas, mining and 
power generation has helped the company lift profits by one third. Samir Brikho, the group's chief executive, has 
raised the company's margin target for 2010 from eight percent to 8.5 percent. The group has been reaping the 
rewards of Mr Brikho's restructuring of the organisation since 2006, after he divested the group of its UK-focused 
construction and infrastructure businesses and moved focus towards high-growth energy and power industries.
CARILLION BULLISH ON GUIDANCE AS PRE-TAX PROFITS GROW
Unveiling a rise in profits and issuing bullish guidance for the year ahead, the construction company Carillion 
<CLLN.L> has reported that its move towards the support services sector appears to be paying off. Its recent 555 
million pound acquisition of Alfred McAlpine <MCA.L> means that less than one-fifth of its profits now comes from 
its construction arm. Chief executive John McDonough said the growth in importance of the support services arm 
would provide added resilience for the company. Overall pre-tax profits for the company rose to 19 million pounds in 
the first half, largely in line with previous guidance.

A passenger jet of Irish budget airline Ryanair made an emergency landing in Rome Friday after an apparent 
malfunctioning of its main landing wheel, airport agency Telenews said.
The plane which carried 160 people on board was on a flight from the northern Italian city of Bergamo and due to 
land at Rome's Ciampino airport.
But the pilot re-routed it to the city's main Fiumicino airport because it was closer after receiving a signal about an 
undercarriage problem.
Security services were on stand-by but the Boeing 737 landed normally. No one was hurt in the incident.
On Monday a Ryanair jet plunged 8,000 metres (26,250 feet) in five minutes and a number of passengers were 
taken to hospital after the aircraft made an emergency landing in the central French city of Limoges.
The Boeing 737 was carrying 168 passengers and seven crew from Bristol in England to Barcelona when it suffered 
what police described a brutal decompression.

Europe's biggest budget airline Ryanair <RYA.I> said on Tuesday it had provided evidence to a European 
Commission inquiry that ticket-touting websites were consistently over-charging travellers.
At the start of this month, the Irish carrier began cancelling and reimbursing up to 500 bookings a day made by 
online ticket agents known as 'screen scrapers' who were selling the tickets to passengers at inflated prices.
It also said screen scrapers were slowing down its website, preventing its usual customers from making bookings, 
and violating its terms and conditions, price guarantees and copyright.
Media reports said many passengers were angry after missing holidays as a result, and the European Commission 
wrote to Ryanair seeking information on whether the airline was breaking laws on passenger rights.
Ryanair said on Tuesday it had provided the European Commission with evidence of four websites, Bravofly.com, 
Edreams.com, Volgratis.com and Wegelo.com, on which the airline's ticket prices had been inflated by 200-300 
percent.
'We are now calling on the European Commission ... to take action to force these unauthorised, illegal 
screenscraper/ticket tout websites to desist from unlawfully overcharging consumers,' Ryanair CEO Michael 
O'Leary said.
The airline said earlier this month that Irish screen scraper BravoFly Ltd had agreed to stop using Ryanair's website 
after the airline took legal action.

Twenty-six people were hospitalised after a Ryanair aircraft en route from Britain to Spain made an unscheduled 
landing in France following a loss of cabin pressure, emergency workers said Tuesday.
The plane landed at Limoges International Airport on Monday around 11:30 pm (2130 GMT) as a 'safety 
precaution', Ryanair said, adding the passengers were hospitalised for ear problems.
The Boeing 737 was flying to Barcelona-Girona airport in Spain from the southwestern British city of Bristol, when a 
brutal depressurisation forced the aircraft to descend 8,000 metres in five minutes, police said.
Terrified passengers told how they had feared for their lives as the aircraft plummeted and oxygen masks dropped 
down.
Of the 168 passengers and seven crew, 26 were hospitalised with minor eardrum problems, emergency workers 
said.
An initial inspection of the plane did reveal any causes for the depressurisation, police said.
Ryanair dispatched another aircraft to Limoges, which departed at 3:30 am with 127 people who wished to 
immediately continue their journey. The remaining passengers were expected to continue on to Girona later on 
Tuesday.

The European Commission has written to Ryanair <RYA.I> for information on whether the airline is breaking laws 
on passenger rights by cancelling up to 500 passenger-flights a day, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
Europe's biggest budget carrier said it started last week cancelling bookings on its Web site made by online ticket 
agents known as 'screen scrapers' who were then selling them on to passengers at inflated prices.
Around 400-500 tickets are being reimbursed each day because they slow down the Ryanair Web site and violate 
its copyright terms, said a Ryanair spokesman.
But media reports say many passengers remain angry after missing holidays.
'The Commission has sent a letter to Ryanair requesting information in order to assess the compatibility of the 
airline's recent alleged policy... on air passenger rights,' said a Commission source. 'This was a fact-finding letter.'
A Commission spokesman confirmed the request for information, but Ryanair said it had not yet received it.
Ryanair said earlier this month that Irish screen scraper BravoFly Ltd had agreed to stop using Ryanair's Web site 
after the airline took legal action.

The long delayed public offering of Poland's flag carrier PLL LOT [LOT.UL] will take place in late 2009 at the 
earliest as it restructures to return to profitability, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, LOT warned the state-controlled airline needed immediate restructuring to avoid a possible cash 
crunch in the face of rising fuel prices, soaring costs and increasing competition from no frill carriers like Ryanair 
<RYA.I>.
'After the third quarter of 2009, if we find the level of restructuring as satisfactory, it will allow us to move to other 
strategic targets, including an IPO (initial public offering),' said LOT's recently appointed CEO Dariusz Nowak.
'I wouldn't see it before the end of the second quarter of 2009,' he said.
He said new management will decide within a year whether LOT is 'floatable'.
Poland had planned to sell down its 68-percent stake in early 2009 along with a quarter of the airline in the hands of 
the administrator of SwissAir -- a hangover from LOT's first failed privatisation.
LOT, which had five chief executives in five years, wants to return to profit in 2010 after an operating loss of as 
much as 275 million zlotys ($122.2 million) expected this year and 120 million in 2009.
Global airlines have suffered from soaring oil prices and concerns that economic woes would weigh on passenger 
numbers, with some analysts warning that the weakest carriers may have a difficult time surviving.

Spanair pilots threatened to strike on Wednesday in protest that the loss-making airline, owned by Nordic carrier 
SAS <SAS.ST>, lacked a plan to save itself.
SAS put Spanair up for sale in 2007, but beset by high fuel costs, falling demand and overcapacity in the Spanish 
market, both Iberia <IBLA.MC> and former owners, Spanish travel company Marsans, pulled out of the bidding.
Spanair remains the main drag on SAS, losing 515 million Swedish crowns ($80.90 million) in the first half of 2008. 
SAS has announced plans to cut 25 percent of Spanair's capacity and shed 1,062 jobs.
'This union believes the organised chaos in which the company exists can't continue, and ... it will take the 
necessary steps to issue a strike call,' Spanish airline pilot union Sepla said in a statement.
The Palma de Mallorca based airline was not immediately available to comment on the strike threat.
Management have said they intend to turn the airline around in the next two to three years before restarting the sale 
process.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary told Reuters on Wednesday he was already looking forward to picking up Spanair 
landing slots at Madrid's Barajas airport in what he said was the likely event of it going bust.

European shares rose by midday on Friday as a weaker oil price boosted leisure and consumer stocks, while 
commodity shares fell in concert with easing raw material prices.
By 1050 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up 0.5 percent at 1,191.06 points, adding 
to a 0.5-percent gain from the previous session and on track to finish the week some 0.7 percent lower.
The oil price dropped by $2 to $113 a barrel, trading near the lowest since early May, pressured by faltering global 
demand and rising supply, boosting consumer, travel and leisure shares.
'This is a supporting factor for the automotive sector as well as for demand-driven industries as consumers feel the 
relief through lower fuel prices,' said Markus Reinwand, equity strategist at German bank Helaba.
The European travel and leisure index <.SXTP> and the DJ Stoxx European retail index <.SXRP> as well as the DJ 
Stoxx European Personal and Household Goods sector index <.SXQP> jumped more than 1 percent each.
Airlines such as Ryanair <RYA.I> rose 4.6 percent, Air France <AIRF.PA> gained 2.3 percent and Deutsche 
Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> by 0.8 percent.
Oil majors such as Total <TOTF.PA> rose 0.8 percent and Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.AS> gained 0.6 percent.
Among retail stocks Swedish fashion giant Hennes & Mauritz <HMb.ST> rose 2.4 percent after posting better-than-
expected July sales figures, defying an economic slowdown as cost-conscious shoppers appeared to favour its 
moderately priced clothes.
Defensive pharmaceutical stocks also gained, with Sanofi-Aventis <SASY.PA> up 2.3 percent after Warren Buffett's 
Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> investment group raised its stake.
Shares in Stada <STAGn.DE> surged 10.6 percent after a media report, citing unidentified sources, said that Teva 
Pharmaceutical Industries <TEVA.O><TEVA.TA> was in talks to buy Germany's third-largest generics drugmaker.
Stada and Teva declined to comment.
Roche <ROG.VX> rose 0.8 percent and Elan <ELN.I> added 7.2 percent.
European shares up by midday, helped by weaker oil
Banks rose with Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX> rising 2.2 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> up 1.1 percent 
and BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> up 1 percent.
DOLLAR STRENGTH
The dollar powered to a six month high against the euro, boosted by jitters on shrinking euro area economic growth.
Citigroup said the economy in the euro area is set for a longer and deeper downturn than the consensus expects.
'The rapid deterioration in the economy's prospects partly reflects the severity of the headwinds from the tightening 
in lending standards, European Central Bank's rate hikes, high commodity prices and strong euro,' Citigroup said in 
a note.
The rise in the dollar sparked a sell-off in commodities and gold fell nearly 5 percent to almost a nine-month low in 
Europe.
As a result, mining stocks had the strongest negative impact on the pan European index, with Xstrata <XTA.L>, 
Anglo American <AAL.L>, Rio Tinto <RIO.L> and BHP Billiton <BLT.L> falling between 1.6 and 3.5 percent.
Around Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> rose 0.2 percent, Germany's DAX index <.GDAXI> added 0.2 
percent and France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> gained 0.9 percent.
Among major gainers, Denmark's Vestas <VWS.CO> rose 5.5 percent after the world's No.1 wind turbine maker 
said its order backlog ballooned.

Ryanair to cancel third-party websites reservations from Aug 26

Irish budget airline Ryanair said on Thursday its decision to cancel reservations made at third-party websites will 
take effect on Aug 26.
The no-frills carrier said last week it would not honour 'unlawful' bookings that were not made on its own website 
and its telephone reservations line.
It accused what it called screenscraping websites of levying 'unnecessary' handling charges, of failing to provide 
up-to-date flight information and of delaying access to the airline's own website by its customers.
Sinead Finn, the airline's director of commercial revenue, clarified at a news conference in Barcelona on Thursday 
that the decision will be effective two weeks from last Monday, or on Aug 26.
She said passengers affected will be reimbursed.
Spain's transport ministry on Tuesday said it is investigating Ryanair over the decision, which Spanish media said 
could affect about 1,000 air reservations a day in Spain.
The Spanish-based eDreams website vowed on Thursday to take 'suitable legal measures' if Ryanair violates the 
rights of its customers.
The airline has already taken legal action against two sites, Ireland's Bravofly and V-tours of Germany, to prevent 
them from listing Ryanair flights.

Ryanair <RYA.I> <RYA.L> has no interest in buying Stansted airport though the airline would be happy to 
cooperate with any potential buyers, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported last week that Ryanair was interested in launching a takeover bid for 
Stansted airport, operated by BAA, itself controlled by Spain's Ferrovial <FER.MC>, but O'Leary said the paper had 
misinterpreted his comments.
'We have no interest in acquiring airports,' O'Leary told a news conference in Dublin on Thursday.

Spain's government has demanded information from Irish airline Ryanair after travel agencies warned the firm was 
threatening to strand thousands of passengers who booked through online brokers.
The public works ministry is now waiting for an answer from Ryanair about its plans to cancel tickets booked 
through Spain's leading online bookers, eDreams, Rumbo and Atrapolo, before deciding whether to take further 
action, a spokeswoman said.
'After the media reports at the weekend, on Monday we acted,' said a ministry spokeswoman.
However, she said the ministry would not necessarily take action against Ryanair as a result.
'The ministry only acts if we find a breach to the law on passenger rights.'
Ryanair has said it is cancelling all flights booked through online travel agencies, which Ryanair calls 
screenscrapers, as it considers the sites are acting illegally.
In a statement, Ryanair said getting rid of agencies would speed up passenger processing times on Ryanair.com 
and ensure passengers are not paying unnecessary handling charges or higher fares.
The Irish no-frills airline is already taking legal action against online bookers in Spain to stop them selling tickets, as 
well as against Irish booker BravoFly and German booker Vtours.
'They can't just take something off our website to resell it,' said Ryanair spokesman Daniel de Carvalho.
He said passengers would have to seek refunds from online agencies.
Spanish agencies reacted angrily to Ryanair's latest move.
Edreams said it was exploring legal action against the Irish airline for damage caused to customers for the 
cancellation of thousands of paid and confirmed bookings.
'Ryanair doesn't want travel agents to offer comparative prices and thereby to show that in many cases Ryanair is 
the most expensive option,' Edreams said in a statement.

Ryanair Holdings is aiming to increase its pretax profit to about 900 million euros by 2012, chief executive Michael 
O'Leary told WirtschaftsWoche in an article to be published on Monday.
'I have said that we're probably making a loss (in the current financial year), given that airfares are falling and oil 
remains expensive. But even then, we (have) 2.2 billion euros of cash and we will hike profit before taxes to about 
900 million euros by 2012,' he was quoted as saying.
Ryanair in late July warned it could make a full-year loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices stayed high and fares 
fell.
To further trigger growth, O'Leary said that the company will lower prices by up to 5 percent per year, while aiming 
to double passenger numbers, its fleet as well as profits by 2012, WirtschaftsWoche said.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair <RYA.I>, said the company is interested in launching a 
takeover bid for Stansted airport, The Daily Telegraph reported on Friday.
A Ryanair spokeswoman declined to comment.
O'Leary told the newspaper that he was convinced the UK Competition Commission's investigation into Stansted-
owner BAA, which is controlled by Spain's Ferrovial <FER.MC>, would recommend breaking up the airports 
operator, which would open the door for a bid of around 2 billion pounds ($3.9 billion).
'While we believe the break up of BAA would improve competition and, therefore, benefit airlines, a Ryanair bid 
would likely come under microscopic scrutiny from a competition perspective, as it is Ryanair's largest base,' 
Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst John Goode said.
O'Leary also said that he would increase passenger numbers from 24 million to 40 million by halving landing fees 
and building a second runway and terminal.
The move comes after BAA this week started legal action against the airline after it refused to pay a 15 percent 
increase in landing charges at the airport, which is its biggest base.

Fraport AG.'s chief executive Wilhelm Bender said recent strikes by workers at Deutsche Lufthansa AG. likely had a 
negative impact on July passenger numbers.
It is not yet clear how severe the impact was, he told analyst during a telephone conference.
Members of Lufthansa's ground and cabin crews at the end of last month staged a strike to push for higher wages, 
which grounded several planes and led to hundreds of flight cancellations.
When the German flag carrier last week came to an agreement with services union Ver.di, it said it will take up to 
two weeks until its flight schedule returns to normal, due to a backlog of planes needing maintenance.
But Fraport still expects the number of passengers handled at Frankfurt Airport, where Lufthansa is its biggest 
single customer, to advance between 1 percent and 2 percent in the full year.
Meanwhile, chief financial officer Matthias Zieschang said it will be a 'real challenge' to break even at Fraport's 
Hahn airport by 2010, as planned.
At Hahn airport, where planes of carriers including Ryanair operate, the number of passengers slid 5.8 percent in 
the first half of this year after Ryanair cut back its operations there and Wizz Air cancelled several flights.

'We've been trying to talk to Boeing about orders beyond 2012 but their prices are too high,' O'Leary told reporters

'We've started talking with Airbus about the possibility of taking Airbus aircraft,' he added, although he said that 
Airbus prices were also too high. Ryanair's fleet currently comprises Boeing aircraft.
The likely size of the purchase would be 200 firm orders and options for an additional 200 planes, O'Leary said.

Ryanair is in talks with EADS unit Airbus and Boeing Co. to buy up to 400 aircraft to secure mid-term growth 
following its recent earnings slump, chief executive Michael O'Leary told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.
Planes are 'about half as expensive as they were a few years ago', he said, because of the currently weak U.S. 
dollar.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier last month said first-quarter net profit slumped 85 percent as its fuel costs soared, 
and warned it may post a full-year loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices remain high.
'But the price will fall below $100 again because demand is declining,' O'Leary told Sueddeutsche. 'There is no oil 
shortage.'
However, if prices remain high, only between three and five European airlines will stay afloat in the longer term, 
among them 'Ryanair and maybe Easyjet', he said.
Airlines around the world have been merging with peers and buying shares in smaller rivals to boost their income in 
the face of surging fuel prices. Oil prices have risen 63 percent in the past 12 months and last month reached 
record levels above $145 per barrel.

UK small caps closed higher, matching strong gains among the blue chips, with Ryanair Holdings soaring as it 
posted a surge in July passenger numbers.
At the close, the FTSE Small Cap index was 27.1 points up to 2,768.1, while the FTSE 100 index rose 134.3 points 
to 5,454.5.
Ryanair Holdings was a strong mover, up 0.37 of a penny to 2.59 -- or nearly 17 percent -- as it said it is confident 
that passenger traffic growth will stay strong, having posted a 19 percent rise in passenger numbers in July.
Minco rose 0-1/2 a penny to 3.125 as investors appeared to approve the appointment on two non-executive 
directors.
A positive update boosted marketing support services company Delling Group 0.2 of a penny to 1.625, as it said it 
expects to report a profit at EBITDA level for the first half of 2008, adding that trading has progressed satisfactorily.
In a similar vein, upbeat results from the Vicsani-1 well drove Aurelian Oil & Gas up 1 to 34, prompting Daniel 
Stewart and Fox David Capital to say 'buy'.
In contract news, Geong International stayed 5-1/2 up to 45-1/2, as it signed a contract extension worth 1.2 million 
pounds with a 'leading' global provider of next generation telecommunications networks.
Elsewhere, AEA Technology rose 5-1/4 to 47-1/4 as it confirmed it received valid acceptances of about 83.12 
percent following its 4-for-5 rights issue of 99.3 million shares announced on June 13.
And Chaarat Gold held on to its early gains, remaining 2 up at 36-1/2, on confirmation that it will begin more 
extensive drilling at the Chaarat project, after it found significant gold mineralisation at all nine holes it drilled at the 
contact zone of the mineral body.
But turning to the losers, and Top Ten Holdings slumped 20 percent to 3-1/2, down 0.875, as the bingo operator 
announced it had slipped to a full-year loss, with profitability hit by a 'challenging environment'.
Finally SDL dropped 8 to 338, continuing its slide from Monday after a strong run, despite news of a multimillion 
pound deal with HP.
The deal led to a string of 'buy' ratings from brokers and with Kaupthing upgrading its price target.

Air France-KLM <AIRF.PA> and Iberia <IBLA.MC> reported big drops in earnings on Tuesday as they suffered 
from an economic slowdown and higher fuel prices even though the cost spike was mitigated by the weaker dollar.
The French-Dutch airline, the world's biggest carrier by revenues, said first-quarter net profit fell 59.4 percent to 168 
million euros ($262 million), but still beat the average forecast from 15 analysts of 145 million euros.
Operating profit fell to 234 million euros from 415 million, in line with an analysts' average forecast of 231 million 
euros.
First-quarter sales were up 5.8 percent at 6.288 billion euros.
Air France-KLM confirmed its full-year objective of operating income in the order of 1 billion euros.
It said that 'in response to the new economic environment', it would reinforce its `Challenge 10' plan with an 
additional 190 million euros in cost-savings.
This would take the total for the financial year 2008-09 to 620 million euros as it wrestles with a fuel bill expected to 
rise to 5.86 billion euros.
Iberia posted a 32.2 million euro ($50.22 million) operating loss in the first half, worse than a forecast of a 25.7 
million euro loss from analysts polled by Reuters.
The Spanish company, which is in talks to merge with British Airways <BAY.L>, posted an operating profit of 69 
million euros a year earlier.
Its first-half net fell 72 percent to 20.7 million euros on flat sales of 2.67 billion euros.
The results come days after British Airways reported an 88 percent fall in quarterly pretax profit in what it called the 
worst-ever trading conditions.
Ryanair <RYA.I>, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, posted a 85 percent fall in net profit at the end of July and 
warned of a full-year loss if oil prices stayed high and fares fell.
Airline operators around the globe are struggling to stay profitable with the price of oil up some 60 percent over the 
past year. Many have shed jobs and are scrapping routes, while the weakest face the threat of bankruptcy.
WRAPUP 1-Air France-KLM net down 59 pct, Iberia makes loss
OIL BELOW RECORDS
Industry lobby group IATA estimates higher crude prices to add $91 billion to the global airline fuel bill and that jet 
fuel, at $141.9 per barrel, is up 75.5 pct from a year ago. Oil is currently below $120 a barrel, down from a record of 
$147 in mid-July. The fuel prices have worried airline investors, knocking 32 percent off Air France-KLM shares this 
year, giving it a market value of $7.6 billion.
Germany's Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> is worth $10.5 billion, BA $5.9 billion, Iberia <IBLA.MC> $2.9 billion and Italy's 
Alitalia <AZPIa.MI> $940 million.
Lufthansa last week stuck to its 2008 goal to match last year's operating result despite a series of headwinds after 
boosting first-half earnings by 45 percent.
U.S. airlines including United Airlines parent UAL Corp <UAUA.O>, US Airways <LCC.N> and JetBlue Airways 
<JBLU.O>, in which Lufthansa holds 19 percent, have all reported second-quarter losses, citing soaring fuel costs.
But All Nippon Airways Co Ltd (ANA) <9202.T>, Japan's second-largest airline, last week reported a 10 percent rise 
in quarterly operating profit on an uptick in international routes and as hedging cushioned the impact of high oil 
prices.
Air France KLM said its fuel bill rose to 1.36 billion euros from 1.09 billion euros a year earlier, a rise of 24.3 
percent.
This was due to a 3 percent rise in volume, an increase in jet fuel costs after hedging of 40 percent and after a 
favourable currency impact of 14 percent as the dollar weakened.
The group said that 'in response to the new economic environment', it would reinforce its `Challenge 10' plan with 
an additional 190 million euros in cost-savings.
This would take the total for the financial year 2008-09 to 620 million euros. It said the fuel bill for the full year is 
estimated at 5.86 billion euros.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it was confident that passenger traffic growth will stay strong as it reported a 19 percent 
rise in passenger numbers in July.
The Dublin-based budget carrier said it carried 5.66 million people last month, compared with 4.76 million during the 
same month a year ago. The load factor, however -- which measures how full its aircraft were -- dropped by one 
percentage point to 89 percent.
Ryanair, which revealed an 85 percent drop in first-quarter profits last month due to the impact of soaring oil prices 
and the impact on air travel of the global economic downturn, said the figures proved that low fares travel was 
growing fast.
The airline's head of communications, Stephen McNamara, said: 'Ryanair's latest passenger figures show we are 
rapidly growing passenger numbers this year.
'The most significant thing about today's figures is that we carried over 15 million passengers in the last three 
months.'
Ryanair said passenger numbers in the 12 months to July were 54.19 million.

BAA sues Ryanair over refusal to pay higher charge

British airport operator BAA has started legal action against Irish airline Ryanair <RYA.I> over its refusal to pay a 15 
percent increase in charges at Stansted airport, Ryanair said on Tuesday.
Ryanair <RYA.L> said in April it would not pay the higher charges imposed by BAA, owned by Spanish firm 
Ferrovial <FER.MC>.
'We are going to fight the action', a Ryanair spokesman said. 'We don't think the fees are warranted.'
A spokeswoman for BAA could not immediately comment.
A BAA spokesman told the Irish Independent newspaper that the airport charges remained within the limit allowed 
by the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.
'This matter is in the hands of the lawyers so it is inappropriate to make any comment at this stage,' the paper 
quoted the spokesman as saying.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, said last month it would cut winter capacity at Stansted, its busiest hub, 
due to high fuel prices and because the cost of using Stansted was too high.
Rival low-cost airline easyJet <EZJ.L> also said in April it wanted to withhold part-payment of price rises by BAA at 
Gatwick airport.

ROUNDUP Lufthansa Q2 figs in line; analysts see FY guidance wobble
ROUNDUP Lufthansa Q2 figs in line; analysts see FY guidance wobble

Deutsche Lufthansa AG. reported second-quarter results that were in line with expectations and affirmed its full-
year guidance, though analysts said surging fuel prices and ongoing strikes by workers may still hit the company's 
results.
Lufthansa earlier said it still expects full-year operating profit to exceed last year's level of 1.378 billion euros as it 
curbs spending in the passenger business, reduces its fuel consumption and hedges its fuel needs.
'Our forecasts are more cautious than company guidance,' said Merrill Lynch analysts in a note.
'We are forecasting a 20 percent decline in operating profit to 1.1 billion euros,' they said, adding they see a risk of 
slowing demand for air travel in the second half of this year as well as a possible impact by strikes.
Grounds crew and cabin crew workers launched strikes this week that have so far led to nine planes being 
grounded and nearly 150 flights being cancelled.
Chief financial officer Stephan Gemkow earlier told journalists he cannot yet assess how much the strikes will cost 
and what the impact on full-year earnings will be.
Talks between the airline and services union Ver.di, which represents some 48,000 of Lufthansa's workers, 
collapsed three weeks ago after the union rejected an improved offer of a 6.7 percent pay increase over 21 months, 
plus 1 percent of one year's annual salary for every worker.
The offer was 1.2 percentage points above the company's previous offer but below the 9.8 percent raise over 12 
months the union demanded.
Lufthansa said its second-quarter operating profit rose to 517 million euros from 450 million euros in the year-earlier 
period, slightly exceeding average analyst forecasts of 515.5 million euros.
The company's passenger division transported 29.3 percent more people during the first six months of this year, 
boosting the top line.
Nonetheless, Lufthansa cut guidance for the division, saying the passenger transportation segment may fall short of 
last year's operating profit level as surging fuel prices squeeze margins.
ROUNDUP Lufthansa Q2 figs in line; analysts see FY guidance wobble
'But Lufthansa has so far dealt with the current environment very well and stuck with its optimistic (group) outlook 
for the year 2008,' said LBBW analyst Thomas Klee, adding the company is so faring better than many of its peers.
Ryanair earlier this week said it is not likely to post a profit this year unless there is a 'precipitous' fall in oil prices in 
the fourth quarter.
And in the United States, United Airlines, US Airways and JetBlue all recently reported losses as fuel costs hurt 
their bottom line.
UniCredit analyst Uwe Weinreich said he still expects Lufthansa to reach its full-year targets 'despite more 
challenging market conditions'.

Europe's largest exchanges are expected to tick lower in opening deals as investors lock in profits ahead of the 
oncoming earnings deluge and as the DJIA closed well off intra-day lows on Friday.
In the U.S., the DJIA index closed 21.41 points higher to 11,370.69 after better-than-expected economic data.
The index had been more than 50 points higher when European bourses closed.
Separately, the S&P 500 index advanced 5.22
Over in Asia, the Nikkei 225 index ended the morning up 71.07 points at 13,405.83, while the Hang Seng index 
ended the morning session 57.31 points higher at 22,798.02.
Meanwhile, oil prices remained close to a seven-week low of about $123 a barrel on Monday, pausing from a 
decline that has knocked more than $23 off crude in two weeks, despite escalating tensions in Iran and Nigeria.
U.S. light crude for September delivery rose 9 cents to $123.35 a barrel by 2335 GMT. The contract fell $2.23 on 
Friday to settle at $123.26, after falling to as low as $122.50, the lowest since June 5.
In earnings news, Budget airline Ryanair warned it could make a full year loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices 
stayed high and fares fell.
The Irish group said adjusted profit after tax for the three months to the end of June had come in at 21 million euros 
($33 million).
Ryanair said first-quarter revenues grew by 12 percent to 777 million euros. That was well below the 865.4 million 
average of five forecasts in a Reuters survey and lower than the most cautious of the five analysts, who predicted 
836.4 million.
The Dublin-based carrier said consumer confidence was plummeting in an emerging recession in the UK and 
Ireland, which it planned to respond to by cutting fares more aggressively than competitors.
And Holland's TNT NV said on Monday it expects full-year 2008 organic growth and operating margins to come in 
at the low end of its guided range as it reported worse-than-expected second quarter results.
Euroshares outlook - profit taking to offset gains in New York, Asia
Sales for the period were 2.809 billion euros, up from 2.689 billion euros last year and in line with estimates of 
2.787 billion to 2.81 billion.
Operating profit (EBIT) was 324 million euros, down from 330 million last year and missing analysts estimates of 
339 million to 352 million.
Net profit fell to 205 million euros from 244 million euros and below estimates of 224 million to 232 million.
TNT said the full-year 2008 is expected to develop within its outlook range, albeit at the low end.
Reckitt Benckiser, the world's biggest household cleaning goods maker, said second-quarter profits rose 11 percent 
and said it was on track to meet its full year sales and profit targets.
Group adjusted net profit for April-June of 240 million pounds ($476.4 million), in line with forecasts ranging from 
229 million to 240 million and averaging 235 million pounds.
In other news, Focus magazine says Deutsche Bank is considering not making a bid for Deutsche Postbank
But investors cheered news Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever Plc. said it will sell its North American 
laundry business to Vestar Capital Partners for $1.075 bln cash, saying the price-tag was in line with market 
expectations.

and TNT.
At 11.47 a.m., the DJ STOXX 50 was down 25.36 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2831.71, while the DJ STOXX 600 was 
down 2.22 euros, or 0.79 percent, to 279.54.
Spread betting company IG Index said the Dow Jones Industrial Average looks set to fall back 44 points in opening 
deals as ongoing uncertainty about the banking sector continues to dominate trading.
In Europe, shares in budget airline Ryanair plunged 13.56 percent after the group warned it could make a full-year 
loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices remained high and the value of fares fell.
The Irish group said adjusted profit after tax for the three months to end-June had come in at 21 million euros.
Ryanair said first-quarter revenues grew by 12 percent to 777 million euros. That was well below the 865.4 million 
average of five forecasts in a Reuters survey, and lower than the most cautious of the five analysts, who predicted 
836.4 million.
The Dublin-based carrier said consumer confidence was plummeting in an emerging recession in the UK and 
Ireland, which it planned to respond to by cutting fares more aggressively than competitors.
The shares were also under pressure after Citigroup cut its stance to 'hold' from 'buy' before the warning.
Peer Easyjet slumped 6.48 percent and larger airlines were also lower. BA fell 4.66 percent. Shares in Lufthansa 
fell only 2.52 percent, finding support from news Citigroup had upped its rating to 'buy' and said the German flag 
carrier is its top pick.
Holland's TNT NV dropped 9.22 percent after it said it expects full-year 2008 organic growth and operating margins 
to come in at the low end of its guided range as it reported worse-than-expected second quarter results.
Euroshares open lower profit taking as Dow closed off highs; Ryanair, TNT weigh
Banks were on the back foot again as Citigroup downgraded the banking sector to 'underweight' from 'neutral', 
saying there will be more pain in the global economy as unemployment rises, there are more corporate failures, 
with asset values at risk and bad debt rates set to pick up.
Credit Agricole fell 3.08 percent.
BBVA was 1.58 percent lower after the Spanish banking group reported 19 percent fall in net income, which some 
analysts said was below the market expectations
Unicredit fell back 2.89 percent. SG Securities cut the Italian bank to 'hold' from 'buy'. Cheuvreux downgraded 
Banco Popular to 'sell' from 'underperform'. Its shares fell 1.55 percent.
There was some unexpectedly good news in the consumer goods sector.
Reckitt Benckiser shares moved up 1.66 percent after the world's biggest household cleaning goods maker said 
second-quarter profits rose 11 percent and that it was on track to meet its full-year sales and profit targets.
Group adjusted net profit for April-June of 240 million pounds, in line with forecasts ranging from 229 million to 240 
million and averaging 235 million pounds.
Investors cheered news Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever Plc., up 1.02 percent, said it will sell its 
North American laundry business to Vestar Capital Partners for $1.075 billion in cash, saying the price-tag was in 
line with market expectations.
Shares in Oil groups Repsol, Total and ENI rose 0.84 percent, 0.73 percent and 0.36 percent respectively, tracking 
crude prices, which rose on Monday as rebels said they had sabotaged two pipelines in Nigeria, which is a major 
exporter of crude.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for Sept. delivery, advanced by 92 cents to 124.18 dollars a barrel.

UK small cap's cemented their bullish start to the week, closing higher, as the blue chips found themselves weighed 
down by banking woes, with XSN the smaller company's biggest boomer as shareholders approved of the 
company's reverse takeover of Marinetrack Ltd.
At the close the FTSE small cap index was up 20.6 points at 2,719.1, whilst the FTSE 100 index was down 40.0 
points at 5,312.6.
XSN shares finished 0.30 pence higher at 1.05 - a 40 percent rise.
Takeover talk lifted Wilmington shares 32 pence to 197. It said it has received a preliminary approach which may or 
may not lead to an offer being made for the company.
Elsewhere, SMC climbed 1.25 pence to 7 pence after the company said the degree of revenue visibility for the 
remainder of 2008 and for 2009 remains high and that the aggregated group revenue shows no evidence of a 
slowdown in demand.
A bullish outlook drove Intelligent Environment's shares 0.875 pence higher to 7-1/2 after it said it expects its first 
half gross profit and operating profit to increase 'materially' compared with the same period last year.
Numbers news lifted OneClickHR 0-1/4 of a penny to 3-3/4 and Pixel Interactive Media 1-1/4 to 17.
Deal news lifted iPoint Media 3/4 of a penny to 17, while Acambis closed 69-1/2 pence higher at 185-1/2 as 
investors continued to cheer Friday's news that the group has agreed to a takeover offer from Sanofi Pasteur -- the 
vaccines division of Sanofi-Aventis -- that values the British company at around 276 million pounds.
Among the fallers, Cains Beer Company's shares received a lashing, falling 3.625 pence to 2.75, as the company's 
widening first-half losses and warning on its full-year performance provided a sobering thought for investors.
Ryanair plunged 0.7125 pence to 2.515, after posting disappointing first-half numbers and a bleak outlook, which 
prompted Collins Stewart to keep its 'sell' rating and Cazenove to repeat its 'underperform' recommendation.
ITM Power dropped 6-1/4 to 53-1/4, as it posted a bigger full-year loss but said its outlook has 'never looked 
brighter', citing increasing momentum for hydrogen as one of the primary sources of renewable power.
UK small caps close higher; XSN shares surge on reverse takeover approval
Disappointing numbers news also hit SDI, down half a penny at 12, Integrated Asset Management, falling 3-1/2 to 
37-1/2, William Sinclair, falling 4 to 57-1/2, Advent Capital, 10 lower at 165 and MTI Wireless Edge, 0-3/4 of a 
penny lower at 17.
Also on the back foot, Cape Lambert dropped 6.75 pence to 30-1/2, as the market reacted negatively to news that 
its shareholders have approved the sale of its iron ore project located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia to 
China Metallurgical Group Corp. for $400A million.
Finally, the termination of offer talks did Aero Inventory no favours. The company's shares plummeted 76 pence to 
455 after it said no satisfactory proposal was likely to be forthcoming.

Leading shares were slightly higher at midmorning on Monday, with oil producers and mining companies gaining 
from higher energy and metals prices, outweighing negatives such as losses for British Airways after disappointing 
numbers from Irish-based Ryanair.
At 9:52 a.m., the FTSE 100 index was 4.4 points higher at 5,357.0, having been down as much as 34 points earlier. 
The FTSE 250 index was down 19.4 points at 8,848.3.
Oil prices picked up from a seven-week low today, with Brent for September delivery trading at $125.56 a barrel, up 
$1.04, amid tension in Nigeria.
Index heavyweight BP, which reports second-quarter results on Tuesday, was 4 pence higher at 521-1/2, further 
helped by the go-ahead to develop a major deepwater project offshore Angola.
The rise came despite continued uncertainty on its Russian joint venture.
Among the other oil companies, BG Group was 12 firmer at 1,120, after HBSC upgraded its rating to 'overweight' 
from 'neutral', while Royal Dutch Shell was up 19 at 1,844. Among the exploration companies, Tullow Oil was up 15 
at 742.
In the mining sector, amid higher prices for most metals, BHP Billiton rose 44 to 1,597, Xstrata took on 86 at 3,356, 
Rio Tinto was up 76 at 5,030, Anglo American was 53 higher at 2,726 and Lonmin ticked up 41 at 2,372.
Positive earnings news from Pearson helped it top the leaderboard, up 18-1/2 at 614. The company reported solid 
first-half results on Monday, boosted by strong profits across its education, FT group and Penguin units, leading to 
a confident outlook for 2008.
Elsewhere, Reckitt Benckiser rose 56 to 2,592 after the group posted an 18 percent rise in first-half pretax profit on 
higher revenues and said it was on track to achieve full-year net income growth target of 11 percent at constant 
exchange rates.
Looking at the downside, airlines were in the doldrums as Ryanair reported that it is highly unlikely to make any 
profit this year unless there is a 'precipitous' fall in oil prices in the fourth quarter of its financial year.
London shares turn higher midmorning; oils and miners gain
British Airways, which reports first-quarter results on Friday, was 11-1/2 weaker at 235-1/4 and mid cap stock 
easyJet was down 24-3/4 at 310-3/4.
Meanwhile, HBOS was down 12-3/4 at 297-1/2 as the weekend press speculated that results on Thursday will see 
the group make major writedowns, as well as lower operating profits as mortgage activity declines.
Its banking peers were also under pressure. Barclays was off 5 at 351-1/2, Royal Bank of Scotland was 4-3/4 
weaker at 210-1/4 and Lloyds TSB was 7-1/4 lower at 324.
Banks may be hurt further with data this week expected to provide yet more gloomy news on the UK economy, 
revealing a further deterioration in the housing market, alongside evidence of a sharp slowing in retail sales and 
consumer confidence.
The release of the monthly house prices survey from Hometrack Monday showed prices fell for the tenth month in a 
row in July.
Average prices were down by 1.2 percent, compared to a 1.0 percent fall in June, with most of the price fall 
concentrated in southern England.
Figures from the Bank of England on Tuesday are expected to reveal a further slowing in mortgage lending and 
approvals, while the closely-watched monthly Nationwide survey is set to show house prices dropping again in July.
Meantime, a broker downgrade left shares in Sage 5.1 lower at 195.9 after JP Morgan cut the group to 
'underweight' from 'neutral'.
Looking at the midcaps, Detica Group surged 58-3/4 to 431 after defence group BAE Systems said it has made a 
538-million-pound offer for the national security consultancy.
In earnings news, Keller Group rose 34 to 682 after it said first-half pretax profit from continuing operations grew 19 
percent to 54.2 million pounds, adding it has entered the second half with a strong order book and expects full-year 
results to be in line with last year's performance.
In broker generated news, Jardine Lloyd Thompson was up 4-1/2 at 406 after Cazenove upgraded the group to 
'outperform' from 'in-line'.
Among the losers, there was more pain for hygiene company Rentokil Initial, after last week's plummet following a 
profit warning. The shares fell another 3-1/2 to 67-1/4 after Merrill Lynch removed the company from its Focus-1 list.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 46.6 points lower at 11324.1 and the NASDAQ was 9.28 points lower at 
2301.25..
Back in the UK, HBOS posted one of the largest percentage falls on the FTSE, off 15 pence at 295-1/4 as Citigroup 
cut its view of the banking sector to 'underweight' from 'neutral' and after a profit warning from Australia's third 
largest banking group Australia and New Zealand bank.
Barclays slipped 7-1/4 pence to 349-1/4, Royal Bank of Scotland fell 5-1/2 pence to 209-1/2, and Lloyds TSB 
dropped 7 pence to 324-1/4.
Meanwhile, a broker downgrade left shares in Sage 6.7 pence weaker at 194.3, with JP Morgan cutting the group to 
'underweight' from 'neutral'.
Elsewhere, airlines were in the doldrums as Ryanair warned it could make a full year loss of up to 60 million euros if 
oil prices stayed high and fares fell.
British Airways, which reports first-quarter results on Friday, shed 8-3/4 pence to 237-1/2, while midcap easyJet fell 
25-1/2 pence to 310.
On the upside, mining issues occupied the top seven spots on the FTSE 100 leaderboard amid higher prices for 
most metals and after a bullish note from Cheuvreux.
The French broker upgraded Anglo American Plc., BHP Billiton Plc. and Xstrata PLc. to 'outperform' from 
'underperform'.
Their shares rose 100 pence to 2,773 pence, 58 pence to 1,611 pence and 77 pence to 3,347.

Sticking with commodities, good gains were seen among oil companies as oil prices picked up from a seven-week 
low today, with Brent North Sea crude for September delivery up $1.58 to $126.10 a barrel.
BP, which reports second-quarter results on Tuesday, added 2-3/4 pence to 520-1/4, also helped by the go-ahead 
to develop a major deepwater project offshore Angola.
The rise came despite continued uncertainty on its Russian joint venture.
Among other oil stocks, BG Group added 10 pence to 1,118, with HSBC upgrading its rating on the company to 
'overweight' from 'neutral', while Royal Dutch Shell took on 23 pence to 1,825.
Elsewhere, Pearson climbed 11 pence to 606-1/2 after solid first-half results, boosted by strong profits across its

In other earnings news, Reckitt Benckiser added 64 pence to 2,600 after posting an 18 percent rise in first-half 
pretax profit on higher revenues and saying it is on track to achieve full-year net income growth target of 11 percent 
at constant exchange rates.
On the second tier, Detica surged nearly 18 percent or 65-1/2 pence to 437-3/4, after defence group BAE Systems 
said it has made a 538-million-pound offer for the national security consultancy, leading Panmure Gordon to 
upgrade the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'.
Keller was up 67-1/2 pence at 715-1/2 after it said first-half pretax profit from continuing operations grew 19 percent 
to 54.2 million pounds, adding it has entered the second half with a strong order book and expects full-year results 
to be in line with last year's performance. Dresdner Kleinwort said the update shows the group put in an excellent 
performance everywhere except North America.
A Cazenove upgrade to 'outperform' from 'in-line' helped send Jardine Lloyd Thompson 2-1/4 pence higher to 403-
3/4.
Among the losers, there was more pain for hygiene company Rentokil Initial, after last week's profit warning. The 
shares fell another 6 pence to 64-1/2 after Merrill Lynch removed the company from its Focus-1 list and Exane BNP 
Paribas cuts its earnings forecasts for the group by 23-25 percent for 2008 and 2009. The broker cut its target price 
to 70 pence from 90 pence.

Average, with banks weighing in London.

Ryanair <RYA.I&gt; is highly unlikely to make any profit this year unless there is a 'precipitous' fall in oil prices in the 
fourth quarter of its financial year, Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said.
Ryanair said earlier on Monday it expected a full-year result of between break-even and a loss of 60 million euros 
on the basis of its current fuel hedges, fourth-quarter oil prices at about $130 per barrel and average fares falling by 
5 percent.
Cawley also told Reuters in an interview that winter capacity cuts at airports where costs are high would remain a 
'continuing feature' for Ryanair.

Ryanair <RYA.I&gt; posted a 85 percent fall in first-quarter net profit on Monday as its fuel bill almost doubled and 
warned it could make a full-year loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices stayed high and fares fell.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier said adjusted profit after tax for the three months to the end of June had come in at 
21 million euros ($33 million). That compared with a net income forecast of 48.8 million euros by brokerage Davy.
Ryanair <RYA.L&gt; said it had made use of a recent fall in oil prices and hedged 90 percent of its fuel needs for 
September at $129 per barrel, 80 percent for the third quarter at $124 per barrel, but remained unhedged for the 
fourth quarter.
'On the basis of our existing fuel hedges, Q4 oil prices at approx. $130 per barrel, and average fares falling by 5 
percent for the full year, we expect to record a full year result of between breakeven and a loss of 60 million euros,' 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

William Sinclair Holdings Plc. slumped 8 percent in early trade, as it cautioned that it sees profits for the 15 months 
to end-September significantly lower than market forecasts.
Shares tumbled 5 pence to 56-1/2 pence, as the group said the lower forecasts are due to escalating costs and a 
weather-hit peat harvest.
In a trading statement, the horticulture and garden products group said it will raise prices to restore margins for the 
next financial year.
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings shed 0.7275 of a penny to 2-1/2 pence -- or more than 20 percent -- as it cautioned it 
is unlikely to make a full-year profit unless fuel prices fall steeply.
The group's deputy CEO added that Ryanir's winter capacity cutbacks will remain.

Ryanair says wins battle to continue late night flights to Rome Ciampino

No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings said it has won a court injunction against the Italian aviation regulator's decision to 
force it to divert late-night flights from Rome's Ciampino airport to the city's other airport, Fiumicino.
The Dublin-based carrier claimed regulator ENAC had 'unlawfully' prevented 18 late evening flights carrying more 
than 2,700 passengers from landing as scheduled in Rome Ciampino since January, instead diverting them to 
Rome Fiumicino Airport.
It said the diversions had resulted in late evening disruption and long and inconvenient bus journeys for thousands 
of Italians and tourists back to Ciampino to collect their cars or to meet relatives.
Ryanair claimed ENAC was flouting its own rules and regulations, which the airline claims allow Ciampino-based 
aircraft to land after the midnight curfew at Ciampino.
The Irish airline said it uses the quietest commercial aircraft in Europe for the flights. These aircraft do not create 
any significant noise because they are landing flights only and do not result in a subsequent take-off.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary accused ENAC of trying to disrupt its operations at Ciampino as part of 
attempts to help beleaguered Italian flag carrier Alitalia.
'We welcome the TAR Lazio Court's confirmation that Ryanair's aircraft can land at Ciampino Airport after the 
curfew and we now call upon ENAC to put an end to these unlawful and illegal diversions, which are causing 
serious disruptions and inconvenience to Ryanair's flights and Ryanair passengers,' O'Leary said in a statement.

UK small caps closed sharply lower, dragged down by weakness among blue chips, with Myhome International 
remaining hard-hit after it announced it has breached some of its banking facility covenants.
At the close, the FTSE Small Cap index was 15.3 points down to 2,716.0, while the FTSE 100 index fell 40.2 points 
to 5,364.1.
Myhome shed 3 pence to 4.875 pence on news it has breached some of its banking facility covenants due to a 
weak economic climate and reduced trading expectations.
However, it said it was in 'constructive' talks with Lloyds TSB to restructure its 8 million pound bank line.
A full-year profit warning knocked 4 off Network Data, to 10, and prompted Brewin Dolphin to cut the stock to a 
'hold' from 'buy'.
Interactive mobile entertainment and information services provider WIN declined 8 to 106 after it also issued a full-
year profits warning.
Customvis fell 0-3/4 of a penny to 2-1/4 after it said it sees revenue for the year to end-June lower than market 
expectations and a loss for the period in the region of 1 million pounds.
Canadian miner Kirkland Lake Gold ended the session 20 off to 415, with news of reduced gold production 
outweighing a narrowing of full-year losses.
Supporta fell 4 to 25 after Romac Investments terminated offer talks. Nestor Healthcare slid 3 to 45 after it emerged 
a sale of the whole company looked increasingly unlikely, leading Brewin Dolphin to cut the stock to 'hold' from 
'buy'.
Northacre stayed strong, up 8-1/2 to 41-1/2, after it successfully won planning permission for its proposed 
residential development of West London's telephone exchange site in Warwick Road.
Ryanair Holdings rose 0.095 a penny to 3.215 after it won its battle to continue late night flights to Rome Ciampino.
Paragon Group of Companies rose 26 to 110 -- or 30 percent -- after it confirmed a number of bid approaches, with 
brokers guessing offers will be in the region of 100 pence to 150 pence a share.
UK small caps close sharply lower; Myhome slumps on covenant woe
Among miners, Herencia Resources rose 0.2 of a penny to 1.05 -- or 23 percent -- after it said the latest drilling at 
the Patricia deposit, part of its 70 percent-owned Paguanta zinc-lead-silver project in northern Chile, has returned 
positive results with multiple high-grade intersections.
Across the sector, Lithic Metals & Energy edged up 0-1/4 of a penny to 5 after it successfully negotiated with BHP 
Billiton for 100 percent unencumbered ownership of the Mavita licences, Mozambique.
Entertainment Rights delivered for investors, rising 1.2 to 6.47 -- or 22 percent -- after it announced the launch of 
Postman Pat on China's state and largest broadcaster, China Central Television.
Collins Stewart retained a 'buy' stance on the stock.
Sinclair Pharma extended gains, closing up 4-1/2 to 37-1/4 on hopes that 2008 sales will be up 30 percent on last 
year, leading to its first profitable full year since its IPO.
Landsbanki kept its 'buy' stance, noting the shares are trading well below its 152 pence fair value on the business.
Summit Corp climbed 7 to 62-1/2 after it entered into a worldwide licensing agreement with BioMarin 
Pharmaceutical for the company's pre-clinical candidate SMT C1100 to treat the fatal genetic disorder Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy.
Landsbanki said its valuation of 135 pence a share represents around 127 percent potential upside to Summit's 
current share price and underpins its 'buy' recommendation for the stock.
Velosi rose 5-1/2 to 92-1/2 on the back of a positive update, while smartFOCUS Group increased 0-1/2 of a penny 
to 10 after the international marketing software group was selected to provide Chelsea Football Club with software 
and services.
Fortune Oil gained 0.85 of a penny to 9.4 following government approval for its Tianjin Tianhui Natural Gas joint 
venture to construct a high capacity gas pipeline from Xiao-Bian-Zhuang to the Jinghai Industrial Park in Tianjin.

Ryanair Holdings, said it has won an injunction against the Italian aviation regulator, ENAC, after the Italian (TAR 
Lazio) Court last Friday overturned ENAC's latest ordinance, which forced Ryanair's Ciampino-based aircraft to 
divert late at night to Rome Fiumicino, disrupting the travel plans of thousands of Italian citizens and visitors.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 'Ryanair calls on the Italian government and particularly the Minister for Transport 
to demand that ENAC stops these unlawful diversions to Fiumicino airport, and requires ENAC to observe existing 
Italian law which allows these Ciampino based aircraft to land as our passengers expect, at Ciampino airport'.

Ryanair blames airport costs, BAA and high oil prices for winter cuts &

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings blamed high airport costs, UK airport operator BAA and soaring fuel prices for a 
decision to cut winter services from London's Stansted airport and to temporarily close some of its European bases.
Ryanair said it had decided to reduce the number of aircraft based at Stansted to 36 from 28, resulting in a 
reduction of about 14 percent in the number of weekly flights from the Essex airport.
The Dublin-based carrier said it estimated that its traffic at Stansted this winter would decline by some 900,000 
passengers against the same period last year.
Ryanair said Stansted was the most expensive of its 28 bases and BAA, owned by Grupo Ferrovial SA, had 
increased airport charges by 15 percent this year, on top of a 100 percent rise last year.
It also criticised the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), saying it had failed to control what it described as the 
'unjustified' cost increases.
'When a regulated monopoly makes it more profitable for airlines to sit aircraft on the ground, rather than fly them 
through the winter, then obviously the CAA's laughable regulatory regime has failed,' Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Ryanair also blamed the cuts on the rise in oil prices to $140 a barrel.
In a separate statement, the airline said it was temporarily closing its operations at seven continental European 
airports between Tuesday Nov 4 and Friday Dec 19.
The airports involved include Basel in Switzerland, Budapest, Krakow and Rzeszow in Poland, Palma in Majorca, 
Salzburg in Austria and Valencia in Spain.
'Costs at these airports are amongst the most expensive in Europe and far outweigh the potential revenue which 
passengers are prepared to pay, particularly during the off-peak winter period,' Ryanair said.

Ryanair calls on EU to examine fuel surcharges imposed by 'greedy' airlines
Ryanair calls on EU to examine fuel surcharges imposed by 'greedy' airlines

Body
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings plc. called on the European Commission to examine 'unjustified' fuel 
surcharges imposed by 'greedy airlines' on air tickets.
'Already high-fares flag carriers such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa continue to impose 
and increase their fuel surcharges with the EU making no attempt to investigate it,' it said.
Earlier, British Airways said it was 'absolutely inevitable' that prices would rise with higher surcharges due to the 
soaring cost of fuel. Lufthansa last week also said it would raise its surcharges.
Ryanair lodged a formal complaint over the matter with the commission in October last year. Airlines have said the 
complaints have no justification as there will never be price fixing between rival carriers.
Airlines have also scrapped flights over the summer to cut back on fuel consumption.

Ryanair to cut flights from Dublin Airport by 18 pct this winter
Ryanair to cut flights from Dublin Airport by 18 pct this winter
July 15, 2008 Tuesday 2:44 PM GMT
Copyright 2008 AFX News Limited All Rights Reserved
Length: 161 words
Body
Ryanair Holdings Plc. announced an 18 percent capacity reduction at Dublin airport this winter, citing as one of the 
reasons the fact that Dublin is the second most expensive of its base airports.
The budget airline also said that with oil prices currently at $140 a barrel, flights departing from high cost or 
expensive airports such as Dublin must be reduced this winter, during the low fare season.
Ryanair also confirmed that it had written to Dublin Airport seeking a reduction in the costs of these flights this 
winter, but this offer has been dismissed by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) monopoly.
The airline estimates that this cutback in winter capacity will result in almost 500,000 fewer passengers using Dublin 
Airport this winter. However by eliminating this traffic, Ryanair will minimise its losses at Dublin Airport this winter. 
Dublin Airport charges up to 15 euros per departing passenger -- more than the total airfare in many cases, Ryanair 
said.

A director of no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings is joining Irish rival Aer Lingus Group Plc.
Ryanair said its director of scheduled revenue, Sean Coyle, 35, has resigned to become chief financial officer of the 
Irish flag carrier, in which Ryanair has a 29 percent stake.
The budget carrier made a takeover bid for Aer Lingus in October 2006, although it later withdrew it after the 
European Commission launched an investigation on competition grounds.
Ryanair said in a statement that it regretted the decision of any employee to leave, 'but particularly when they are 
joining smaller, high fare competitors'.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: 'We wish Sean Coyle every success in his new role. We are pleased 
to see Aer Lingus recruit some decent management and hope Sean will introduce some of the changes we have 
been calling for in Aer Lingus.'
Coyle will join Aer Lingus on August 11. The flag carrier's chairman, John Sharman, said: 'Sean has proven 
experience and will significantly strengthen our management team.'

Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. said all the flights to Romania's Arad airport have been cancelled effective 
July 31, due to the failure of the County Council and its president, Iosif Matula to sign and honour its agreement 
with Ryanair.
Ryanair said it will replace the Arad service with a three times weekly service from Bergamo in Italy to Berlin 
Schoenefeld.
The company said it had been looking forward to carrying 50,000 passengers in the first year of operations to the 
Arad region.
The budget carrier said, based on the short-lived success of the three flights per week it was running to Arad - 
which started in April - it had been considering expanding services from the Airport but now all plans for additional 
flights have been cancelled.

The European Commission said it will formally investigate public funding which the Hessen and Rheinland-Pfalz 
regional authorities gave to Frankfurt Hahn airport.
As part of the investigation it will also look at its parent company, Fraport AG, and the airport charges and individual 
contracts concluded with Ireland's Ryanair.
The Commission investigation follows complaints from a competing airline and from an association of airlines.
The Commission investigation relates to two capital increases, which took place in 2002 and 2004, as well as a 
profit-and-loss transfer agreement, between the airport and Fraport, and an individual contract with Ryanair.
The Commission believes Flughafen Frankfurt Hahn GmbH might have acted like a private market investor, but 
that, at this stage, there is insufficient evidence to show this beyond reasonable doubt; the commission is therefore 
inviting interested parties, including the German government, to give their views.

Low cost airline easyJet Plc said it is starting a 90 day consultation with its staff over whether to close its Dortmund 
staff base. The UK-based carrier has also said it will cut about half of all flights from the city in its winter schedule.
The airline said in a statement it was considering the closure because of the operating schedule at the airport. 
There are a total of 116 easyJet employees currently based at Dortmund.
'Dortmund airport has the most stringent operating hours of any easyJet crew base which significantly hampers 
aircraft utilisation, eroding easyJet's competitiveness in Dortmund,' it said.
'As a result, easyJet has just three aircraft based at Dortmund which, in the context of today's oil price, is insufficient 
to provide the economies of scale and crewing efficiency necessary to support a low-cost operation.'
In reaction, rival low-cast carrier Ryanair Holdings, which also operates flights from the area, said in a statement it 
has released 100,000 seats at 10 euros including taxes and fees on its 22 routes from Dusseldorf-Weeze, which is 
80km outside of Dusseldorf, to celebrate the easyJet decision.

UK small caps remained lower at midday, tracking the downward trend in the wider market, with Brightside a major

ahead at 5,997.8.

on Hogg Robinson shares, up 2 pence at 43.

in Ethiopia has found high-grade mineralisation.
Furthermore, drilling at the adjacent Gudeya-Guji and Guji prospects has shown mineralised quartz veins.
Buyers came for Patagonia Gold, 1/2 a penny firmer at 10-3/4 pence, following news that drilling at the company's 
Cap-Oeste project in Argentina continues to intersect high-grade gold and silver, and the mineralised structure 
remains open at depth and along strike in both directions.
Again on an upward path, Record rose 5 pence to 91 pence after the specialist currency investment manager 
turned in more than doubled full-year pretax profits.

acquisition and upgrade in reserves estimates at the Dulisma fields.

consultancy disclosed a rise in full-year pretax profits to 2 million pounds from 600,000 pounds and said all 
indications are that it 'will see a year of significant growth' going ahead.
Finally, a contract win for TT Electronics lifted its shares 3 pence to 126-1/2, after it said on Tuesday it has won

Leading shares were higher midmorning, with Royal Bank of Scotland leading a revival for some the banks battered 
in recent days.
At 10:05 a.m., the FTSE 100 index was 15.2 points ahead at 6,022.8, compared with a high for the session of 
6,039.0 and a low of 5,993.3. The FTSE 250 index was 25.7 points up at 9,954.0.
'It seems the banking boys have rescued the FTSE after the sell off Monday. The banks have taken such a 
battering over the past year with Bradford & Bingley down around 80 percent for the year and other banks 50 
percent lower, there comes a point where valuations start to look good again,' said Mark Priest, head of equity sales 
at Tradindex.
Banking stocks were recovering from recent losses as investors went bargain hunting following Monday's sharp 
declines, triggered by the profit warning and revised equity offering at midcap Bradford & Bingley.
Royal Bank of Scotland topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 9 at 235, bouncing from its lowest in several years 
amid continued doubts about its 12 billion pounds rights issue.
Lloyds TSB was 6-3/4 higher at 384. Bradford & Bingley topped the FTSE 250, up 3 at 70.
Some retailers were also bouncing following recent weakness, notably B&Q parent Kingfisher, up 1.9 at 136. 
Kingfisher reports first-quarter numbers Wednesday.
Oil services group AMEC was up 24-1/2 at a record 873 after it announced a deal with BP.
And, UK natural gas producer BG Group gained 23 at 1,264 after it announced it has signed two liquefied natural 
gas agreements with Brazil's Petrobras.
However, other oils were under pressure following, with crude prices slipping back a little this morning. Brent for 
July was trading at $127.64 a barrel midmorning, down 38 cents.
BP was down 3 at 601-1/4 and Royal Dutch Shell fell back 9 to 2,124.
Some miners were also lower with one trader noting profit taking following their recent rally.
Rio Tinto was off 38 at 6,132, Vedanta Resources was down 56 at 2,449.
London shares higher midmorning; Royal Bank of Scotland leads rebound
In the FTSE 250, easyJet was 5 higher at 290-1/2 after rival budget airline Ryanair Holdings announced a full-year 
adjusted profit after tax of 480.9 million euros compared to 401.4 million euros the previous year.
Media group Informa was up 14 at 383, benefiting from JP Morgan initiating coverage following the bank's merger 
with Bear Stearns. JP Morgan named Informa as one of its top picks in the sector with an 'overweight' rating and 
525 pence price target, pointing to its strong revenue streams.
On the downside, Electrocomponents fell back 2-3/4 at 165-1/4 as Goldman Sachs cut its price target on the group 
to 192 pence, from 236, while also cutting the time horizon for that target to six months, from 12 months, but 
retaining its 'buy' rating.

No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings announced plans to ground up to 10 percent of its aircraft this winter and said it 
would break even in 2009 if oil prices remain at 130 US dollars a barrel as it unveiled a 20 percent rise in adjusted 
profits after tax to 480.9 mln euros.
Ryanair said it would take up to 20 aircraft temporarily out of service mainly at Stansted and Dublin, where it said 
high airport charges make it more profitable to ground aircraft rather than fly them through the winter.
It said the outlook for the coming fiscal year to March 2009 remains entirely dependent on fares and fuel prices.
'Based on forward bookings, we now believe it likely that average fares for the coming year will rise by 
approximately 5 percent,' Ryanair said in a statement.
'If oil prices remain at 130 US dollars per barrel, then we expect to accordingly breakeven for fiscal '09.'
The Dublin-based carrier said passenger numbers rose 20 percent during the year to 50.9 million. It said revenues 
lifted 21 percent to 2.7 billion euros from 2.24 billion previously. Adjusted basic earnings per share were 22 percent 
higher at 31.81 euro cents per share.

High fuel prices will trigger a rash of airline bankruptcies, leaving only five major carriers in Europe, the head of the 
German unit of Britain's easyJet said in an interview published Monday.
'Several airlines in Europe will go out of business,' John Kohlsatt told Berlin's daily Der Tagesspiegel. 'Theoretically, 
50 are endangered.'
Several carriers have been hit hard by rising fuel costs and are sliding into the red -- a development that in the end 
may leave only British Airways, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, 'and us', Kohlsaat said.
He said easyJet would weather the storm due to its relatively low operating costs and modern, fuel-efficient fleet.
He said easyJet, currently the fourth-biggest airline in Europe, has no plans to revise its aircraft orders despite the 
high cost of fuel.
'We have ordered 119 and have options for another 88,' he said. 'We will double in size in the next five years.'
EasyJet said last month that net losses deepened in the first half of its financial year to 43.3 million pounds due to 
steep fuel costs and the takeover of GB Airways.
Record-breaking oil prices have almost doubled in the past year and have surged by more than 20 dollars since the 
start of 2008.

Ryanair Holdings, the European low-cost airline, has issued a statement calling on air traffic control (ATC) to 
compensate passengers for flight delays, and called for competition in the EU air traffic control industry, following a 
strike by air traffic controllers in Italy.
'Government monopoly ATC providers fail to control either their costs or their staff and allow restrictive work 
practices to handicap recruitment and training. This inevitably leads to long delays throughout the summer', the 
airline said in a statement.
Ryanair's director of flight & ground operations, David O'Brien, said: 'It is an outrage that monopoly ATC providers 
should be permitted to sabotage the travel plans of millions of passengers every summer, while increasing their 
charges at the same time.
'EU Governments have failed abysmally to protect passengers from the service failures of these overpriced 
monopolies.'

Europe's leading bourses moved higher in opening deals, tracking overnight gains in New York and Asia after a 
smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. durable goods orders Wednesday but Infineon was left out in the cold after it 
warned third quarter EBIT will be knocked by flat sales in its communications business.
At 12.23 p.m., the DJ STOXX was up 13.56 points, or 0.44 percent, at 3183.53 and the DJ STOXX 600 was up 0.87 
points, or 0.27 percent, at 321.02.
Spread bettors, IG Index, said the Dow looks set to slip around 5 points lower after gains yesterday as investors 
stick to the sidelines ahead of today's data.
In the United States, first-quarter GDP is expected to be upwardly revised to 1.0 percent from 0.6 percent, with 
most of the revision taking place in the trade sector, economists said.
The Core PCE Price Index, the U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, is expected to have 
remained at 2.2 percent in the first quarter, the same annual rate as in the previous quarter.
This morning, a rebound in Euro zone M3 in April and a record fall in UK house prices in May, added to investor 
uncertainty ahead of the BoE and ECB rate setting meetings next Thursday.
Also limiting gains was German chipmaker, Infineon which fell 8.88 percent after the group said it expects revenues 
in its communications unit in the third quarter to be about flat from the previous quarter and expects EBIT to suffer 
accordingly.
The news also dragged Nokia down 0.71 percent although the Finnish handset giant said delays to its single chip 
phone ramp up will be immaterial. Alcatel-Lucent was down 1.88 percent.
Shares in Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA were 3.24 percent lower in mid-session trading after chairman 
Fernando Conte warned of a difficult 2008 due to a deteriorating economy, increasing competition and rising oil 
prices.
Speaking at today's AGM, Conte called for strategic alliances and sector M&As as one of the few solutions for 
struggling airlines to weather the current crisis.
Euroshares off lows midday as Dow seen weaker; Infineon warning weighs
Air Berlin Plc. -- which issued a profit warning in April -- said today it will hike prices for its flights and eliminate 
some unprofitable routes to offset surging fuel prices. Shares fell 1.75 percent.
The company will launch measures in the coming three to four weeks, he said.
And shares in easyJet Plc. and Ryanair Plc. slipped in morning trade, with Numis Securities cutting its earnings 
estimates and price targets for the two in a note warning of an imminent industry crisis in the wake of high oil prices.
And Volkswagen fell 2.03 percent as Deutsche Bank cut its recommendation on the shares to 'sell' from 'hold'.
And Saint-Gobain was at the top of the fallers board, down 2.69 percent, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares 
to 'neutral' from 'buy', as it believes the weakening operating environment will likely lead to increasing pressure on 
pricing.
But it wasn't all doom and gloom, with RWE and Iberdrola up 2.21 percent and 0.54 percent respectively as the pair 
were both upgraded to 'buy' from 'neutral' at UBS. RWE also got a boost from vague talk of a bid from private equity 
group Permira and Warren Buffet -- who is understood to be looking for acquisitions in Europe.
SSE was flat midday, having pulled back some of its early morning losses after the U.K. utility reported a well 
received set of full year results.
Oils remained higher ahead of U.S inventory data later even though the price of crude slipped below $130 per 
barrel.
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery was down $1.30 cents at $129.70 a barrel.
Total was up 0.94 percent but off earlier highs. Repsol added 0.38 percent and Royal Dutch Shell added 1.23 
percent.
BG Group, which is expected to sweeten its original bid for Origin Energy Ltd with a cash offer of at least $13A.2 
billion for Australia's second largest retail energy supplier added 1.47 percent.
And shares in the world's largest hedge fund manager, Man Group, went 3.82 percent higher after the group 
reported a higher than expected rise in full year profits, prompting Credit Suisse to lift its target price to 670 pence 
from 640 pence.
The broker repeated its 'outperform' stance and said it is raising its net inflows forecasts for 2009 and 2010.
It said the price target hike was driven by this increase and by the better than expected cost in today's numbers.

Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings, could decommission more than the 20 planes that it announced 
at an investor briefing last month, reported The Sunday Times.
As soaring fuel costs make routes uneconomic, the company had said last month that it planned to take 20 planes 
out of commission -- nearly three times the number it mothballed last year. However the paper said it is now thought 
that number could be much higher when the company reports annual results on Tuesday week.

Ryanair Holdings PLC welcomed the High Court's decision on its appeal of the Commission for Aviation 
Regulation's (CAR's) Interim Determination on airport charges at Dublin Airport.
The Court found that there was 'clear ambiguity' in the CAR's determination and that Ryanair was justified in 
bringing the claim.
Ryanair claims the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has allowed a 50 percent hike in check-in desk charges and a 
doubling of charges for check-in kiosks at Dublin airport.
The Court Tuesday ordered the CAR to clarify its treatment of some 1.2 billion euros of capital expenditure in its 
interim review and the CAR has now confirmed that this figure has been included in the regulated asset base 
(RAB), which will lead to a doubling of passenger charges at Dublin Airport.
The Court also found that the Minister for Transport was wrong in not allowing Ryanair to appeal the inclusion of 
this 1.2 billion euros.
Ryanair is therefore again calling on the Minister to establish an Appeals Panel with a view to removing this 
spending from the RAB.

British Airways Plc plans to ground part of its fleet from October to cut costs and stem potential losses caused by 
soaring fuel prices, the Sunday Times newspaper reported, citing chief executive Willie Walsh.
Scheduled airlines rarely ground aircraft, preferring to keep their expensive fleets in the air, although Ryanair has 
kept planes on the ground during slack periods.
Walsh said: 'You should certainly expect us to do that this winter.'
BA plans to park its oldest, least fuel-efficient aircraft and this may include Boeing 747s, 767s and 737s, Walsh 
said.

Ryanair said the load factor for April 2007 was boosted by Easter, which fell in March this year, rather than April.

The commissioner said that although France sometimes appears to fear globalisation, it has a large number of 
global players and profits from the opening of its markets and demand from emerging countries.
'To increase growth, France should develop its competitive markets,' Kroes said.
The commissioner said that the liberalisation of energy markets and competition will stimulate growth and 
innovation.
On mergers, Kroes said the commission is not 'dogmatic', as it only blocks less than 1 percent of proposed 
acquisitions.
She said that France in fact benefits from the commission's policy, citing the merger of airlines Air France and KLM.
They are also protected from the creation of dominant companies, as Air France was protected by the commission's 
block of Ryanair Holding PLC.'s proposed takeover of Aer Lingus Group PLC.

A Ryanair plane carrying 170 passengers slipped off the runway at a Lodz airport in Poland amid strong winds on 
Tuesday, forcing the airport to close, said Lodz airport spokesman Milosz Wika.
'A violent wind forced the pilots to place the aircraft at the end of the runway,' Wika said. 'For a reason yet to be 
established, one of the aircraft's wheels left the runway, digging into unstable ground.'
No-one was hurt, but the airport remained closed mid-afternoon with the passengers taken 120 km by bus to 
another airport near Warsaw for departure. Incoming flights were also being diverted.

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings said it is increasing its checked-in baggage fee from nine euros to 10 euros a bag, 
and its airport check-in fee from four euros to five euros, to encourage passengers to carry only hand luggage and 
check in online.
The higher charges will apply from May 5, the company said.
Announcing the increases, spokesman Peter Sherrard said: '40 percent of Ryanair passengers currently avoid 
queues at both check-in and boarding by availing of our free web check-in service, and this increase in baggage 
fees will result in fewer checked in bags and more passengers changing to on-line check-in.'

The European Commission said it has not yet formally received notification of low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings 
Plc.'s complaint against further financing from the Italian government for flag carrier Alitalia SpA.
A spokesman for EU transport commissioner Jacques Barrot said: 'We take note of the intentions stressed by the 
company...to file a complaint. For the moment, we haven't formally received it.'
The spokesman reminded that the EU executive has asked the government for more information on the financing, 
after saying that 'doubts' had been raised about its nature.
The spokesman declined further comment on the process. The Italian government last came to the rescue of the 
carrier in 2001. Under EU rules, Alitalia is not allowed state aid again until 2011.
Yesterday, Ryanair called on the commission to stop Alitalia receiving a further 300 million euros as a state loan 
from the government.
Ryanair claims Alitalia has already received over 5 billion euros in state aid, which the Irish airline alleges is 
'unlawful'. The Irish budget airline says that without such financial assistance the Italian flag carrier would have 
gone bankrupt years ago.
Earlier on Friday, Italy's incoming prime minister Silvio Berlusconi criticised the commission for questioning a move 
by the state to bail out the carrier with a loan.
'They are making things difficult,' Berlusconi said at a public meeting, the domestic news agency ANSA reported. 
'But I'm not worried by this question, the European Union should help just causes and not create difficulties.'

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. has called on the European Commission (EC) to stop embattled carrier 
Alitalia Spa. receiving a further 300 million euros in state aid from the Italian government.
Ryanair claims Alitalia has already received over 5 billion euros in state aid, which the Irish airline alleges is 
'unlawful'. The Irish budget airline says that without such financial assistance the Italian flag carrier would have

'We are calling on the Commission to stop ignoring this state aid scandal and to start applying its own state aid and 
competition rules fairly,' said Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of legal and regulatory affairs in a statement.
Earlier today the EC said it had 'doubts as to the nature' of the Italian government's bridging loan for Alitalia.
'What we want to understand is whether this is a commercial operation or whether there is a state aid element,' 
Michele Cercone, an EC spokesman said earlier.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said the efficiency of the 27 member state bloc's strategy on state aid 
ensures that a gap in productivity with the United States is closing.
Speaking on wide-ranging issues of competition policy in Paris, Kroes said: 'The gap is now closing, after a decade 
of widening up until 2006.'
'Our state aid framework addresses market failure instead of picking winners. Rather than being rooted in dogma, 
state aid rules are flexible like our merger guidelines'.
'Our vibrant competitive markets are already full of winners, picked by consumers, from level playing field,' she said, 
citing the examples of Suez SA., Vivendi Universal SA. and Vodafone Group.
On merger policy, Kroes said the commission was right to block low cost air carrier Ryanair Holdings' proposed 
acquisition of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group Plc. 'Stopping that merger protected passengers on more than 14 
million journeys,' she said.
Turning to individual countries, Kroes said Finland was an example of how to create a competitive economy in 
Europe.
'Creating a positive competitive framework for business works - smaller member states such as Finland...(has) 
demonstrated this. The thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises clustered around Nokia in the Helsinki 
region are a direct example.'
'Nokia succeeded because Finland, according to the World Economic Forum's index, has an exceptionally 
competitive business environment. Nokia didn't wait for a government subsidy and the result is Finland has its foot 
on the economic accelerator'.

ROUNDUP Easyjet, Ryanair to challenge BAA price rises as airport profits lift

Two no-frills airlines announced plans to challenge BAA over higher charges at Gatwick and Stansted airports on 
Tuesday as figures from the airport operator reportedly showed its profits from Heathrow rose by 10 percent last 
year.
Easyjet Plc. said it had informed the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of its intention to seek a judicial review of a 
21 percent increase in charges imposed at Gatwick from April 1.
Irish rival Ryanair Holdings also said it would seek a review if BAA goes ahead with a proposed seven percent 
increase in passenger charges at Stansted.
Both airlines said they were planning to withhold part or all of the increases until the outcome of the reviews are 
known.
Easyjet and Ryanair announced their intentions as the Times reported Tuesday that the holding company used by 
Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA and two other investors to buy BAA, Airport Development & Investment Ltd (ADIL), 
made 438 million pounds from Heathrow last year, up 40 million from the previous year.
Profits at Stansted rose 68 percent to 86 million pounds after the operator doubled its charge for each passenger 
using the airport, the newspaper reported, quoting figures from ADIL's accounts.
Airlines, politicians and watchdogs have criticised BAA for under-staffing and poor service at Heathrow and its other 
London airports. The company is currently grappling with baggage system problems that ruined the launch of 
Heathrow's flagship Terminal 5.
It is also waiting to hear the outcome of a Competition Commission investigation, which may recommend the sale of 
one or more of the group's airports.
BAA said in a statement that its charges are set by the CAA, which it said determines 'a reasonable rate of return 
for the company to make at its regulated airports'.
'We are investing heavily to improve air passengers' experience and have recently recruited an additional 2,200 
security officers,' the statement said.
ROUNDUP Easyjet, Ryanair to challenge BAA price rises as airport profits lift
'We are also investing 5.8 billion pounds over the next five years to improve facilities at our airports.'
The CAA said last month it would allow BAA to increase charges at Heathrow by 23.5 percent in real terms from the 
current 2007/08 price cap, with allowed charges subsequently increasing in each of the following four years by no 
more than retail price index (RPI) inflation plus 7.5 per cent each year. At Gatwick, charges will rise this year by 21 
percent with allowed charges subsequently increasing in each of the following four years by no more than RPI 
inflation plus two percent.
The CAA said its decision would allow BAA to invest in facilities and to improve its service. The airport operator 
claimed the increases were inadequate and airlines condemned them as excessive.
Easyjet's chief executive Andy Harrison said in a letter to BAA's new chief executive Colin Matthews that it 'objects 
strongly' to last month's decision.
'We are determined to address what we consider to be a regulatory decision that we consider to be unlawful and 
damaging for the airlines, our passengers and the industry as a whole,' Harrison said.
Easyjet said it plans to withhold part of the 6.97 pounds charge at Gatwick until it knows the outcome of the review.
If its challenge fails, the airline will hand over the money withheld to BAA along with any interest accrued, Harrison 
said.
If it succeeds and a lower charge is then set, Easyjet will implement a mechanism to return what it had saved to 
passengers, he said.
Ryanair said the proposed increase at Stansted comes on top of a 100 percent increase in passenger charges 
imposed in April 2007.
The Dublin-based airline said that if BAA imposes the increase -- the maximum allowed by the CAA -- it will launch 
judicial review proceedings and will withhold the latest increases, in an escrow account, until the outcome of the 
proceedings.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: 'These latest unjustified price hikes by the BAA airport monopoly prove that it 
is abusing its monopoly power over passengers and airlines at Stansted.'
The High Court could make a decision on the case by the end of the year if it approves EasyJet's application for a 
hearing, the Sunday Times reported last month.

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings said it has written to BAA, owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, objecting to a

The proposed increase comes on top of a 100 percent increase in passenger charges imposed in April 2007, the

Authority, it will launch judicial review proceedings and will withhold the latest increases, in an escrow account, until

No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings is facing potential regulatory action over what a watchdog has described as 'a 
catalogue of breaches' of advertising rules.
The United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it has asked the UK's Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT) to consider taking action against Ryanair over alleged repeated infringements of the Code of Advertising 
Practice, which aims to protect consumers and promote fair competition.
The ASA said in a statement it had formally investigated complaints about Ryanair's advertisements in the past two 
years and had found the company had breached the rules seven times.
It said Ryanair was persistently misleading consumers by making exaggerated claims about the extent of flight 
availability at the advertised price and advertising prices that were not inclusive of taxes and charges.
The ASA also said in a statement that Ryanair had made misleading and denigratory comparisons with competitors, 
had not stated clearly significant restrictions that would exclude customers from taking advantage of an offer and 
had not provided evidence to prove the claims it was making.
ASA director-general Chris Graham said the action was 'disappointing but absolutely necessary'.
'The ASA has given Ryanair every opportunity to put its house in order and ensure its advertising adheres to the 
codes,' he said.
'Instead, they have continued to mislead consumers and denigrate competitors.
'We would prefer to work with advertisers within the self-regulatory system rather than call in a statutory body, but 
Ryanair's approach has left us with no option but to refer them to the OFT, which will consider appropriate action.'
On Friday, Ryanair complained to the OFT about the seven rulings made by the ASA against the company's 
advertisements.
The carrier claimed the ASA had demonstrated 'a repeated lack of independence, impartiality or fairness where 
Ryanair is concerned by making factually inaccurate and untrue findings in response (in some cases) to totally 
baseless and unsubstantiated alleged complaints.'
Ryanair facing possible action over breaches of advertising rules - watchdog
Under the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988, the OFT can ultimately apply for a High Court 
injunction to prevent companies printing misleading advertisements.
An OFT spokesman confirmed it had received the ASA referral. 'The OFT is considering what action would be 
appropriate and proper in the circumstances,' he said.

The European Commission on Monday unveiled plans to enable air passengers across the European Union to 
make and receive in-flight phone calls, removing a major obstacle for telecoms operators who want to launch this 
service this year.
Under the new rules, airlines would be granted national licences by the EU member states in which they are 
registered.
These licences would be recognised throughout the EU, allowing airlines registered in France or Spain to offer 
mobile phone services when flying over Germany or Hungary without any additional licensing procedures.
Airlines such as Air France, BMI British Midlands and Ryanair are planning to hold or are currently holding trials, 
and telecoms groups are keen to launch the service.
Passengers' phones will be linked to an onboard cellular network connected to the ground via satellite, and will be 
prevented from connecting directly to mobile networks on the ground below.
This will ensure that transmission powers are kept low enough for mobile phones to be used without affecting the 
safety of aircraft equipment or the normal operation of terrestrial mobile networks.
Airlines need to install mobile communication services on aircraft (MCA) equipment, which is produced by several 
mobile equipment manufacturers.
It consists of a 'picocell' (a very small mobile base station or mobile 'mast') and a 'Network Control Unit'.
The Network Control Unit stops onboard phones from trying to connect directly with land-based cellular networks, 
which are not designed to deal with high-speed movement.
Until now, the potential disturbance to land-based mobile networks was one reason for prohibiting mobile phone 
use in planes.
Fears that mobile phone transmissions would interfere with on-board navigation equipment have also been quelled 
since mobile phones need much less power to connect to a base station that is only a few metres away and on 
board the aircraft itself.
EU clears path for in-flight mobile phone use
New regulation proposed today does not cover the pricing of in-flight mobile phone use, but the EU says it will 
closely monitor the levels and transparency of charges.
It also recognises the potential annoyance of in-flight mobile phone conversations, and calls on operators to create 
the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure customers using the service do not disturb other passengers.
Air France says it will assess at the end of their six-month trial period whether customers prefer a service limited to 
sending and receiving text messages and e-mails or a full service which also allows them to make and receive 
calls.
BMI, which will trial in-flight mobile phone services for six months starting in June says it will also study customers' 
feedback on the service closely.

No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it plans to close its Dublin telesales operation, with the potential loss of 
up to 40 jobs.
Ryanair said the closure, which is scheduled for the end of May, is part of a cost-cutting programme aimed at 
combating record oil prices.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary described the decision as a 'painful one', but said the operation was no longer 
viable or cost-competitive against a background of declining demand for telephone bookings, which now account for 
less than 1 pct of its sales, against 99 pct done over the internet.
O'Leary said the group's existing Romanian and German call centres will continue to provide telesales services at 
costs 60 pct lower than those of the Dublin operation.
'These kinds of cost savings must be made if Ryanair is to remain Europe's lowest cost airline in these difficult 
recessionary markets,' he said.
'Whilst we will be encouraging these telesales people to apply for other vacancies in Ryanair, should they not apply 
or be successful, then they will be made redundant at the end of May.
'While record high oil prices and falling fares continue, it is sensible and prudent that we streamline our business

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC will have to make cost savings of around 400 mln eur to compensate for 
higher jet fuel costs as the airline imposed a pay freeze on management.
Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive told a press conference in Brussels that Ryanair's current 68 
usd/barrel fuel hedges expire on April 1. With the oil price hovering around the 100 usd/barrel Mark O'Leary said 
the airline was freezing the pay of over 30 of its senior management team for 2008.
'Given the enormous increase in our fuel costs, and the likelihood that profits over the coming year may fall, it is 
appropriate that Ryanair's senior management lead this cost reduction programme by example, with a pay freeze in 
2008,' he said in a statement released after the event.
O'Leary said Ryanair's 2008 fuel bill would rise by about 400 mln eur, and confirmed the airline needs to cut costs 
by the same amount. He added that significant cost cuts were also needed in many areas, and did not rule out 
withdrawing Ryanair flights from certain airports.
'We are working intensively on other cost reductions, including focusing on airport costs and handling costs, staff 
costs and other operating expenses, as we expand Ryanair while lowering fares but absorbing much higher oil 
costs,' O'Leary said.
O'Leary reaffirmed that Ryanair's profit forecast for the year to end-March 2009 ranges from a 5-10 pct rise to a loss 
of 50 pct. He said the forecast would be reviewed at the 2007/8 results presentation, in the first week of June.
In February Ryanair said it was 'essentially unhedged' on fuel for next year, adding that high oil prices would 
impose significantly higher costs for the 2008/09 full year.
Earlier this month, Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet said its fuel bill in the second half could rise by 45 mln stg if the 
price of jet fuel remains at current unprecedented levels.
The oil price continues to hover above the 100 usd/barrel mark on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

EasyJet PLC has remained silent about a report claiming it plans to challenge a decision to increase landing fees at 
some of BAA's London airports.
'I cannot give you any kind of comment about that because it's pure speculation,' a spokesman for the Luton-based 
no-frills carrier said.
The Sunday Times said easyJet plans to request a judicial review of the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) decision to 
allow BAA, owned by Spanish construction company Grupo Ferrovial SA, to increase landing charges at Heathrow 
and Gatwick airports in the next five years.
The CAA said the rises would allow the operator to invest in facilities and improve its service. BAA said the increase 
was inadequate.
EasyJet has retained London law firm Lane & Partners as its adviser and informed the CAA and BAA nine days ago 
of its move to seek a review, The Sunday Times said.
It is expected to formalise a claim to the High Court within a month, the newspaper said. If the court accepts it has a 
case, arguments could take another six months, with a decision possible by the end of the year, the newspaper 
cited legal sources as saying.
Rival no-frills carrier Ryanair Holdings said yesterday it would join the action and privately owned BMI is also 
expected to take part, The Sunday Times said. Virgin Atlantic is undecided and British Airways PLC is unlikely to 
participate, the newspaper said.

Six people were slightly injured when an aircraft operated by Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC skidded off 
a runway as it landed in heavy rain in the French city of Limoges, officials and the airline said.
A regional government official said 186 passengers and crew were on board when the Boeing 737 overshot the end 
of the runway by 40 metres on Friday.
In a statement, Ryanair said everyone on board left the plan safely using its emergency inflatable slides and that a 
pregnant passenger had been taken for a check-up.
'At the time of landing it was raining. The runway was wet and exposed to strong winds, although within normal 
safety parameters,' the airline said.
The plane had flown in from Charleroi in Belgium and most of the passengers were Belgian. Two of those hurt 
needed treatment in the university hospital in Limoges, a city in central France, officials said.
Jean-Pierre Limousin, chairman of the chamber of commerce that manages Limoges airport, said: 'A build-up of 
rain water on the runway seems to have caused the aircraft to slide on the slick tarmac.'

A Dutch court in The Hague has rejected claims by various airports and airlines that flight taxes proposed by the 
Dutch government breach European law and contradict international aviation agreements signed by the 
Netherlands.
The ruling paves the way for the introduction of an environmental tax on airline tickets of 11.25 eur per flight for 
European destinations of less than 2,500 km and 45 eur for longer flights, proposed by the Dutch government last 
year.
The case was brought by Amsterdam airport Schiphol Group, Dutch travel bureau association ANVR, the Board of 
Airline Representatives in the Netherlands (Barin), Ryanair Holdings PLC and Maastricht Aachen Airport.
The Dutch Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transport said earlier this month they are examining the 
possibility of adjusting flight taxes to suit the length of a flight and the type of aircraft used, according to media 
reports.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has hit out at the UK Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) decision to 
allow costs at London airports to rise by up to 50 pct between 2008 and 2013.
The CAA yesterday bowed to pressure from BAA to increase the amount the airport operator can charge 
passengers. At London Heathrow the CAA has allowed charges per passenger to rise by 23.5 pct from April 1, 
2008, followed by increases of 7.5 pct plus inflation for each of the following four years. In the case of London 
Gatwick, a similar 21 pct hike next month will be followed by increases of 2 pct plus inflation for each of the 
following four years.
'The bureaucrats have proved to be impotent in defending the interests of travellers against monopolies. This 
decision impacts London's competitiveness as a world city. If we don't fix London's dysfunctional airports, the city's 
regular travellers will find a more convenient home. Frankfurt, for example, would be only too happy to welcome 
them, said Giovanni Bisignani,' IATA's director general and CEO.
The hike in charges were justified, said the CAA, because improvements to Heathrow and Gatwick need to be paid 
for.
Airlines including British Airways PLC, bmi, easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings and Virgin Atlantic have all roundly 
opposed the price hikes.

The Dutch Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transport are looking into the possibility to adjust flight taxes to 
suit the length of a flight and the type of aircraft used, newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad reported.
The ministries held talks with the aviation sector last week about the matter, a spokesman from the Ministry of 
Finance told the FD.
The spokesman added that Finance State Secretary Jan Kees de Jager will unveil the results of the discussions in 
May. If the flight tax is adjusted, the changes will implemented with the new tax oplan in 2009, the newspaper 
reported.
The Dutch government decided last year to put an environmental tax on airline tickets: 11.25 eur per flight for 
European destinations less than 2,500 kilometres and 45 eur for longer flights.
But Amsterdam airport Schiphol Group, the Dutch travel bureau association ANVR, the Board of Airline 
Representatives in the Netherlands (Barin), Ryanair Holdings PLC and Maastricht Aachen Airport have launched 
legal proceedings against the Dutch state to prevent the introduction of the tax.
The organisations claim the flight tax will not yield the Dutch government's desired environmental benefits and is in 
violation with European law and contradicts international aviation agreements signed by the Netherlands.
A court in The Hague will deliberate over the case today.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has published its submission to the Irish aviation regulator on the cost increases being 
sought by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA).
Earlier this month the DAA formally applied for a 50 pct hike in check-in charges levied on airlines and has taken 
the first steps towards introducing new charges for check-in kiosks.
Ryanair claims the aviation regulator has refused to publish the DAA's justifications for the price hikes on the 
grounds that they were 'confidential and commercially sensitive'. The regulator posted a notice on his website 
inviting submissions from airline users but Ryanair alleges airport users have been denied the opportunity to 
comment on the DAA's submissions because they have not see them.
By doing this Ryanair claims the regulator has breached his statutory obligation to meet the requirements of users 
by failing to publish this information for them.
'The principal duty of this regulator is to protect the reasonable requirements of airport users... the regulator has 
refused to provide users with the reasons for these cost increases,' Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard said in a 
statement.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has filed a complaint with the European Commission against the 
Dutch government, alleging it granted state aid of over 400 mln eur per annum to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport and 
to Air France-KLM.
Ryanair alleges the aid is being granted by the Dutch government in the form of an exemption of transfer 
passengers from a so-called 'ECO-TAX' on air travel.
'While Schiphol is effectively the only Dutch airport handling transfer passengers, Air France-KLM accounts for 95 
pct of the transfer traffic at the airport. This tax exemption is almost exclusively benefiting Schiphol and the Air 
France-KLM monopoly,' Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs said in a statement.
Ryanair claims that in Sept 2007 the Dutch Council of State confirmed it should have been notified to the European 
Commission as state aid.

Ryanair, the budget airline, is closing its website for three days next week after missing a deadline set by the Office 
of Fair Trading (OFT) to remove misleading prices from the site, the Times reported.
The expensive shutdown will allow Ryanair to revamp its website and meet the OFT's rules for including taxes and 
other charges within headline fares, the paper said.
It could cost the carrier 20 mln stg in lost revenue, delivering a further blow to the airline after it said profits could 
halve next year because of worsening economic conditions, the newspaper reported, adding that concern over the 
airline's strategy has prompted Deutsche Bank to warn of a possible 'business model failure'.
The OFT gave Ryanair a deadline of Jan 31 to make changes to its fares. When this was missed, the Ireland-based 
carrier was given a new deadline of the end of February. The airline is understood to have told the OFT that next 
week's three-day website shutdown was to enable it to comply with the new rules, the Times said.
The paper said that if it had missed yet another deadline, the OFT could have begun enforcement proceedings 
against Ryanair. This could have resulted in a court order to shut down the airline's booking system until the fare 
changes were made, it added.
The OFT was concerned that airlines were misleading passengers by advertising low fares that did not include 
extras, such as tax. However, Ryanair said yesterday that it was closing online bookings only to expand the 
website's capacity, the Times reported.

Brussels Airport's new 17 mln eur low-cost terminal will be operational from next year, and expects to attract an 
additional 4 mln passengers to the airport annually, Belgian weekend press reported.
The new terminal will renovate a disused section of the airport, adding a new jetty with six gates, financial daily 
L'Echo reported, citing a decision taken by Brussels Airport management.
Currently only 22 low-cost flights operate daily from the airport, making up 3 pct of the total traffic. This is less than 
Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, Munich and Vienna.
'That is too few compared to what our competitors are offering,' the airport's chief executive Wilfied van Assche told 
La Libre Belgique.
EasyJet PLC welcomed the move as a 'step in the right direction', whereas the Belgian airlines organisation BATA 
is already talking of 'discrimination', since the new terminal will be limited to low-cost carriers, likely excluding flag-
carrier Brussels Airlines.
For the time being, Brussels Airlines remains guarded on the plans. It said: 'We will study and evaluate the project 
with care.'
However, L'Echo said: 'No one is fooled. The low-cost terminal is conceived on the EasyJet model and the 
B.flex/B.light (Brussels Airlines' tariff scheme) model does not fit into this scheme.'
The airline also disputed its exclusion from the title of low-cost carrier, since it offers a number of its B.light fares 
from 49 eur single, including taxes.
A company spokesman told La Libre Belgique: 'They are forgetting a bit quickly that our company has launched a 
range of tariffs as competitive as the recognised low-cost companies.'
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC said it does not fear competition to its services from Brussels South 
Charleroi Airport, with which it signed a ten-year commitment in December 2006.
'We have the most competitive operational costs here and guaranteed growth possibilities,' a Ryanair spokesman 
told L'Echo.

Charleroi Airport chief executive Marcel Buelens warned that Brussels Airport's new project would sound the death 
knell for Brussels Airlines.
'It is evident that this new low-cost terminal is being made to measure for EasyJet which will kill off Brussels Airlines 
with its (more competitive) fares structure,' he told L'Echo.

Easyjet PLC, Singapore Airlines, Emirates Airlines and Qatar Airline could take up slots freed by Alitalia SpA at 
Milan's Malpensa airport, said SEA airport operating company chairman Giuseppe Bonomi.
SEA, which operates Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, has launched a 1.2 bln eur legal action against Alitalia 
for cutting its flights from Malpensa and ending hub activities at the airport.
'We know that easyJet wants to double its fleet (at Malpensa) by 2008. Non-EU airlines want to increase 
operations, like Singapore Airlines and Emirates Airlines,' said Bonomi.
'Qatar Airline wants to increase frequencies and use some of the slots. But we are talking point-to-point traffic,' he 
said in margins of a conference.
At the conference on Malpensa's future, participants called for Alitalia to call a moratorium for three years on its 
cutbacks so the airport can in the meantime find alternative hub activities.
Bonomi reiterated recent comments that SEA's short to medium plan is to contain losses from Alitalia's withdrawal 
and in the longer-term finding an airline to operate a hub at Malpensa.
Alitalia has already notified to Italy's slot co-ordinator Assoclearance it is giving up the slots for the summer season 
and normally these are reasigned after a few days, Bonomi said.
However, the Lombardy region, which opposes Alitalia's cutbacks, has regulations which can block slot 
reassignment, he said.
SEA rejected Ryanair Holdings PLC's recent proposal to site operations at Malpensa because the airline wanted 
additional discounts, and SEA wants to give fair and equal treatment to all its users, he said.
Bonomi reiterated SEA's legal action has been launched and while a hearing has not yet been fixed this should take 
place in the next few months.
The continued loss of time in resolving Alitalia's exit makes it more difficult to set up a moratorium, he said, noting 
Alitalia has recently changed its ticket sales system.
Easyjet , Singapore, Emirates , Qatar airlines may take up Milan's Malpensa slots
Bonomi said he could not forecast how many Alitalia's slots would be reassigned, adding it is 'unthinkable' that all 
will be taken up.

Ryanair Holdings PLC will have to pay 60,000 eur in damages to French president Nicolas Sarkozy and first lady 
Carla Bruni after the pair won a lawsuit against the airline for using a photo of the couple in an ad campaign.
The Paris court ordered Ryanair to pay Bruni 60,000 eur in damages, well short of the 500,000 euros she was 
seeking for the unauthorised use of her image. Sarkozy was awarded a symbolic sum of one euro in damages, as 
he had requested.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said its third quarter profits fell by 27 pct and warned profits for next year 
could decline by as much as 50 pct.
The Dublin-based carrier saw its Q3 profit after tax fall to 35 mln eur from 48 mln eur last time. Ryanair's sales for 
the period increased 16 pct to 569 mln eur from 493 mln eur, while its adjusted basic EPS fell 24 pct to 2.35 eur 
cents from 3.09 eur cents.
The carrier said with oil prices at around 90 usd a barrel and fear of recession in the UK and many other European 
economies, the outlook for the coming fiscal year was poor. The airline said it is 'essentially unhedged' on fuel for 
next year, adding that high oil prices would impose significantly higher costs for the 2008/09 full year.
'At our most optimistic, a combination of flat yields and 75 usd oil would see profits grow by 6 pct to approximately 
500 mln eur, but at our most conservative, if forward oil prices remain at 85 usd, and consumer sentiment/sterling 
weakness leads to a 5 pct reduction in yields, then profits in the coming year could fall by as much as 50 pct to as 
low as 235 mln eur,' Ryanair said in a statement.
For the current year, however, the airline has maintained previous guidance of net profit growth of some 17.5 pct to 
roughly 470 mln eur.
The Irish airline said it carried 3.68 mln passengers last month -- 17 pct more than the 3.14 mln it carried in January 
2007.

149.4 at 6,029.2 on Friday.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.83 points, to 12,743.19 after climbing more than 200 points Thursday.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16.87, or 1.22 pct, to 1,395.42, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in March, was 3 cents lower at 88.93 usd a barrel.

Deutsche Bank, with an increased price target of 185 pence from 155 this morning, according to market sources.

In further M&A talk, Punch Taverns has tabled a secret all-share proposal to swallow Mitchells & Butlers, its 
embattled rival, according to the Sunday Telegraph.
While the Observer said the Chinese government is preparing to launch an unprecedented legal challenge against

The same paper suggested three private equity groups are pondering a 3 bln stg bid for ITV.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank predict British Land will reveal this week that net asset value will have plunged by more 
than 16 pct since the end of September, said the Sunday Times.
Among smaller the companies reporting results today is specialist recruiter Sthree. The company warned in 
November that full-year results would be around 3 mln stg below consensus estimates, blaming unusually high 
levels of investment and one-off systems related costs.
Meanwhile, year to Dec 2007 sales at Wolfson Microelectronics could possibly still come in towards the higher end 
of the 226 mln usd-232 mln revenue guidance range this morning, according to Landsbanki's Dan Ridsdale.

Proposals are expected from Olivant Advisers, the buyout firm led by former Abbey chief Luqman Arnold; a 
consortium fronted by Virgin Group; and an in-house team led by Paul Thompson, the former chief executive of 
insurer Resolution who was appointed to the Rock's board last month.
Royal Bank of Scotland climbed 6.43 pct after the group sought to reassure investors. The banking group told the 
Sunday Telegraph it would consider offloading part of its minority stake in Bank of China if a deepening crisis in the 
banking system required it to raise fresh capital.
But Societe Generale was left out in the cold, pulling back some of last week's M&A fuelled gains, as a number of 
brokers have tried to dampen speculation, suggesting a deal is no way certain. Shares fell back 2.51 pct.
Banco Santander slipped back 0.41 pct after UBS cut its rating to 'neutral' from 'buy'.
And shares in Ryanair Holdings fell 11.53 pct -- their lowest level in over two and a half years -- after the low-cost 
airline posted a 27 pct fall in third quarter profits and warned earnings for 2008-09 could decline by as much as 50 
pct due to higher oil prices.
Euroshares higher midday as Wall St seen adding to gains; M&A hopes add interest
Peer Easyjet may be facing similar fuel pressures sending the company's shares down 5.1 pct.
Elsewhere among transport groups, Daimler shares were up 2.5 pct after the car maker said US sales of its 
Mercedes-Benz brand rose 7.1 pct in January -- far outstripping the performance of other car makers. Broker 
WestLB also upgraded the company to 'buy' from 'add.'
Peugeot stormed 3.89 pct higher as SG Secs said the French car maker is its preferred sector pick. The broker 
repeated its 'buy' saying the group's lack of exposure to the US gives it a defensive profile.
Back in M&A, Saint-Gobain shares added 2.19 pct as French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanchereported Wendel 
--- the building materials groups' largest shareholder -- is planning to take advantage of Saint-Gobain's current low 
share price to raise its capital stake in the company.
And Rio Tinto slipped back 0.59 pct amid reports the Chinese government is preparing to launch an unprecedented 
legal challenge against BHP Billiton's planned 130 bln usd takeover bid for its rival.
The report comes just a few day after aluminium companies Chinalco and Alcoa bought a 12 pct stake in Rio Tinto, 
a move which was viewed by some as a spoiler to BHP Billiton's bid. Shares in BHP Billiton added 1.05 pct.
Elsewhere in the mining sector, prospective buyers from Asia, Europe and South America, including one of China's 
biggest state-controlled banks, have made secret approaches to buy Glencore's 14 bln stg stake in Xstrata, the 
London-listed mining group.
Shares in Xstrata fell 1.85 pct after reports Brazilian mining group Cia Vale do Rio Doce fired Merrill Lynch as co-
lead adviser after the investment bank decided not to help finance a potential 90 bln usd takeover bid for the Anglo-
Swiss group.
Merrill was told by Vale that it would lose its advisory role in the takeover if it did not commit a large part of its 
balance sheet to finance the transaction, people close to the situation told the Finacial Times.
However, the bank concluded that the terms of the financing were not economically feasible for either its own or 
Vale's shareholders.
Elsewhere in the UK, shares in ITV rose 3.14 pct after the Observer newspaper said three private equity groups are 
pondering a 3 bln stg bid for ITV, citing investment bankers.
Bear Stearns upgraded its stance on the UK TV group to 'peer perform' from 'underperform'.

Leading European bourses look set for more gains in opening deals after a strong performance on Wall Street on 
Friday, with M&A hopes and earnings news likely to add some interest although the week's key focus will be 
interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the ECB on Thursday.
In the US on Friday, the DJIA rose 92.83 points, to 12,743.19 after climbing more than 200 points Thursday as 
investors set aside anxiety over news that the economy lost jobs last month and focused on Microsoft Corp's bid for 
Internet company Yahoo Inc.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16.87, or 1.22 pct, to 1,395.42, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 
23.50, or 0.98 pct, to 2,413.36.
In Asia this morning, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed up 362.54 points or 2.7 pct at 13,859.70, while Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng was up 752.88 points or 3.1 pct at 24,876.46, by midday.
Another busy earnings week in Europe kicks off with numbers from Italcementi, Atlas Copco, Ryanair and Sage.
Elsewhere, car stocks will likely garner some interest with Daimlerchrysler taking centre stage after news late Friday 
that total car sales slumped 4.3 pct in January but Daimler's sales rose.
M&A hopes -- which lifted the FTSE back above the 6,000 point level on Friday -- look to spark more interest in the 
UK again today with TV group ITV in focus as three private equity groups are reportedly pondering a 3 bln stg bid 
for ITV, according to investment bankers.
Apax, Provident and KKR are 'running the numbers' and considering an opportunistic offer of about 100 pence a 
share, the Observer said.
The share price of the UK's biggest commercial broadcaster closed near an all-time low of 73 pence on Friday, 
which analysts say makes ITV vulnerable to a bid.
One of the countrys largest pub operators, Punch Taverns, has approached troubled rival Mitchells & Butlers, 
owner of the Harvester and All Bar One chains, about a merger that would create Britain's biggest pub group, 
weekend newspapers reported without citing sources.
Euroshares outlook - up on new Dow gains ahead of ECB, BoE decisions
Punch is understood to have submitted the proposal late last week following M&B's disclosure that it had recorded 
a 274 mln stg loss on failed interest rate and inflation hedges, reports said.
And the Chinese government is preparing to launch an unprecedented legal challenge against BHP Billiton's 
planned 130 bln usd takeover bid for Rio Tinto, The Observer reported.
High-ranking officials from the Chinese embassy in London have been approaching top City law firms over the past 
month for help in blocking what would be the world's second-largest takeover, the paper said.
Elsewhere in the mining sector, Prospective buyers from Asia, Europe and South America, including one of China's 
biggest state-controlled banks, make secret approaches to buy Glencore's 14 bln stg stake in Xstrata, the London-
listed mining group.
Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Group is not planning additional sweeteners to Northern Rock's shareholders 
as it prepares to submit its business plan for the stricken bank by a government deadline today, The Times 
reported, citing sources.
Royal Bank of Scotland would consider offloading assets including part of its minority stake in Bank of China in the 
event that a deepening crisis in the banking system requires it to raise fresh capital, The Sunday Telegraph 
reported, citing sources close to the bank.

STOCKS: Wall Street capped a week of big gains with another sizeable advance Friday after investors set aside 
anxiety over news that the economy lost jobs last month and focused on Microsoft Corp's bid for internet company 
Yahoo Inc and a possible rescue plan for the troubled bond insurance sector.
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index each rose more than 4 pct for the week, 
their steepest gains since March 2003.
Stocks fluctuated at times Friday, however, as investors weighed seemingly contradictory readings on the 
economy.
The Labour Department's employment report for January said the economy lost 17,000 jobs, marking the first 
contraction of the labour market in more than four years. The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 pct from 5 pct in 
December, though the move came as the labour pool shrank.
Thomson Financial Europe AM at a glance share guide: Stocks up, oil lower
The Commerce Department reported that construction spending dropped 1.1 pct in December -- the most in 15 
months and twice what analysts expected.
Also, rating agency Moody's Investors Service warned on a conference call Friday that it expects to downgrade 
some bond insurers this month.
Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management, a business group, said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 
50.7 from 48.4 in December. Wall Street had expected the figure would come in at 47, a reading that would indicate 
a contraction of the manufacturing sector.
FOREX: The dollar rose Friday against the euro and the British pound, helped by rising stock prices and a modest 
expansion in the US manufacturing sector despite a weak report on jobs.
The dollar rose to 1.4803 usd per euro from 1.4877 usd Thursday. The dollar jumped to 1.9677 usd per British 
pound from 1.9900 usd. The dollar also inched up to 106.47 yen from 106.43 yen.
The dollar fell to 99.38 Canadian cents from 1.0040 cad.
BONDS: Bond prices slipped in late trading. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.60 pct 
from 3.59 pct Thursday.
OIL: In energy markets, oil prices fell below 90 usd a barrel after the US government reported weak jobs data for 
January, fuelling concerns that a recession may undercut energy demand.
March heating oil futures lost 8.02 cents to 2.4489 usd a gallon, while March gasoline futures dropped 7.38 cents to 
2.2834 usd a gallon.
METALS: Gold futures fell sharply Friday after the dollar strengthened and investors cashed in profits following the 
metal's big January gain.
Other precious metals traded mixed, with silver easing off a 28-year high and platinum hitting a record for a second 
straight session.
After a sharp overnight rise, gold for April delivery fell 14.50 usd to 913.50 usd an ounce on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange.
Meanwhile, platinum prices continued their upward climb amid power disruptions in South Africa, the world's 
leading platinum producer and second largest gold producer.
March silver rose to 17.345 usd an ounce -- its highest level since 1980 -- before settling at 16.870 usd, down 12.5 
cents. March copper lost 2.5 cents to 3.2730 usd a pound.

STOCKS: Asian markets began the week with strong gains as Wall Street's advance Friday fuelled buying of 
battered stocks although many are worried the upturn could be short-lived due to concerns about the health of the 
US economy.
BONDS: Japanese government bond prices ended the morning lower as investor demand for safer assets declined 
after share
prices rebounded sharply following a rally on Wall Street.
FOREX: The US dollar was higher against most major currencies midway through the session in Sydney after rising 
stock
prices and a modest expansion in the US manufacturing sector helped the greenback advance against the euro and 
sterling on Friday.
OIL: World oil traded flat in Asia after concerns for the US economy appeared to outweigh the impact of OPEC's 
decision to hold output steady.
In morning trade, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in March, was 3 cents lower at 88.93 usd 
a barrel. Brent North Sea crude for March delivery was up 2 cents at 89.46 usd a barrel after settling 2.77 usd lower 
at 89.44 usd a barrel in London on Friday.

*Friday's close
STOCKS: London shares closed firmer Friday as Wall Street recovered from lows, with the mining sector among 
the major gainers following news that two companies had acquired a stake in Rio Tinto.
Leading European shares ended higher Friday, wrapping a solid week of gains for the major STOXX indices, as 
investors on both sides of the Atlantic welcomed the US Federal Reserve's decision last Wednesday to cut interest 
rates once again in a bid to avert a US recession.
BONDS: European government bonds tracked Treasuries higher after a mixed US economic data supported the 
overall view that interest rates are set to fall further in the US. In the UK, gilts were higher after data showed very 
weak growth in the manufacturing sector at the same time as record-high price pressures.
FOREX: The dollar ended the week on a fairly solid tone, particularly against the euro and the pound, despite a 
surprise fall in US employment numbers in January.
OIL: Oil dropped by almost 2 usd on heightened recession fears after US job figures dropped for the first time since 
2003. A slowing US economy has dented the crude demand outlook.
METALS: Gold and platinum hit fresh all time highs Friday, while silver and palladium were at multi-year peaks, as 
a soft dollar, South African mining disruptions and a slowing US economy saw money pour into the complex.
Base metals came off day highs, with most turning lower after much weaker than expected US payrolls data 
reinforced fears the world's largest economy is heading into recession.

France's union of autonomous airlines (Scara) has sent a letter to the French government accusing various 
European air carriers of sidestepping French employment laws to unfair competitive advantage, a spokesperson for 
the transport ministry confirmed following a report in Le Journal du Dimanche.
The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the letter in which Scara accuses Ireland's Ryanair, Air France 
subsidiary CityJet, US company NetJets and Switzerland's Global Jet of employing staff in France but applying the 
employment legislation of their own country.
This allows them to avoid social charges and thereby generate substantial cost-savings, the paper said.
Citing the letter, the paper said Scara, which groups together all French autonomous airlines except Air France, has 
asked French transport minister, Dominique Bussereau to investigate employment practices at the companies in 
question and apply the necessary sanctions.
A spokesperson for the transport ministry confirmed receipt of the letter.
'Scara has already alerted the State to the issue of the application of regulations by companies based in France 
and work inspectors regularly carry out checks,' the spokesperson said.

Ryanair offers charitable donations to settle Sarkozy, Bruni case
Ryanair offers charitable donations to settle Sarkozy, Bruni case

Budget airline Ryanair has offered France's President Sarkozy and Carla Bruni damages of 1 eur and charitable 
contributions of 5,000 eur each as settlement for legal action over the use of a photo of the couple in a recent ad 
campaign.
The photograph showed the couple smiling dreamily while a caption next to Bruni reads 'With Ryanair, my whole 
family can come to my wedding'.
Lawyer Thierry Herzog said the photo was used without the couple's consent. Sarkozy is seeking a symbolic sum of 
1 eur in damages while Bruni is demanding 500,000 eur for violation of their right to privacy.
Ryanair said today it had previously written to Sarkozy's office apologising for any offence caused, and it offered to 
make a donation of 5,000 eur to charity.
The airline said its lawyers will today tell the French courts that it is happy to settle the claim for 1 eur and it will 
renew its offer of a payment to charity, and it will make a similar offer to Bruni.
Ryanair's spokesman Peter Sherrard said the company had apologised to both Sarkozy and Bruni over the ad, 
which it said intended to reflect 'humorously and positively' on their very public and publicised relationship.

France 's Sarkozy, Bruni take Ryanair to court over ad campaign
France's Sarkozy, Bruni take Ryanair to court over ad campaign

President Nicolas Sarkozy and his girlfriend Carla Bruni are taking budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC to court 
over a photo of the couple featured in a recent ad campaign, their lawyer said.
The photograph showed the couple smiling dreamily while a caption next to Bruni reads 'With Ryanair, my whole 
family can come to my wedding'.
Lawyer Thierry Herzog said the photo was used without the couple's consent and a Paris court is to hear the 
complaint on Thursday.
Sarkozy is seeking a symbolic sum of 1 eur in damages while Bruni is demanding 500,000 eur from Ryanair for 
violation of their right to privacy.
Earlier today, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld 13 complaints over a Ryanair newspaper 
advert depicting women dressed as schoolgirls. The watchdog ruled the ad 'appeared to link teenage girls with 
sexually provocative behaviour' and that it was likely to cause offence.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has increased checked-in baggage and airport check-in fees with immediate effect for 
all new bookings.
The Irish low-cost carrier said for all bookings made from today onwards, Ryanair's checked in baggage fee will 
increase from 5 stg to 6 stg per bag and the airport check-in fee will increase from 2 stg to 3 stg.
The airline claims the move is part of its 'continued drive to encourage passengers to travel without checked in 
bags' and use its free online check in facility.

UK smaller companies rallied from a day of lows to edge slightly higher at the close, lifted by a revival among the 
blue chips, with Fiberweb gaining 30 pct on bid hopes.
At the close, the FTSE Small Cap index was 1.90 points up on 3,079.90, having fallen as low as 3,002.70 earlier 
today, while the FTSE 100 index rose 161.90 points to 5,740.10.
Fiberweb rose 14 pence to 60 pence, as it said it is in talks with Tel Aviv-listed Avgol on a possible offer for the 
company, prompting Dresdner Kleinwort to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy' while upping its price target to 
90 pence on valuation grounds.
The broker said the offer is significantly in excess of the level at which the shares have been trading in recent 
weeks.
GW Pharmaceuticals extended gains, up 7 pence to 74-1/2 pence, following its trading update, which prompted 
Investec to keep 'buy' on the stock.
Across the sector, Protherics rose 3-1/2 pence to 53 pence, as it said AstraZeneca has treated the first patient in its 
expanded phase 2 programme of CytoFab in severe sepsis, and that it expects to report the first study in about 12 
months.
Reacting, Seymour Pierce kept 'buy' on the stock, saying the long-awaited start of the trial means Protherics can 
shift its focus to its other development programmes.
Elsewhere, A&J Mucklow Group took on 50-1/4 pence to 358-1/4 pence, ahead of its interim results next month, 
while Ryanair edged up 0.35 of a penny to 4 pence as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism said low-cost 
airlines captured 41.7 pct of the Spanish market share in December, up 35.4 pct from a year earlier.
Hertford International ticked up 0-1/2 a penny to 30-1/4 pence as Allianz Insurance raised its holding in the 
company to 8.79 pct from 5.74 pct.
Hertford has also signed a contract to supply 10,000 CrewCard pre-paid debit cards to Easy Debit Card Ltd.
Financial details were not disclosed.
UK small caps nudge slightly higher at close; Fiberweb top riser on bid hopes
Jetion Holdings nudged up 3 pence to 124 pence as its non-executive director Gabriel Kow purchased 15,612 
shares at 124.28 pence each, lifting his stake in the company to 42,102 shares or about 0.06 pct, while Trust 
Property Management stayed 0-1/2 a penny up on 14-1/2 pence, as director Benjamin Mire snapped up 200,000 
shares at a price of 17 pence apiece, taking his holding to 29.33 pct of the equity.
Completing a hat-trick of share-buying, China Biodiesel rose 2 pence to 21 pence as a director of the company 
purchased 90,000 ordinary shares, lifting his stake to 0.19 per cent.
DM stayed 1 penny higher on 15-1/5 pence as it said it sees full-year pretax profits and revenues to be ahead of 
market expectations, following continued strong growth across all key areas.
But, turning to the losers, Humberts Group shed 7-1/2 pence to 7-3/4 pence -- nearly half its value -- on its news 
late yesterday that it expects a 'small' current year first quarter loss and an overall first-half loss, prompting 
Panmure Gordon to cut its forecasts on the group while keeping 'sell'.
EBTM lost 1-1/2 pence to 2-3/4 pence -- a 35 pct decline -- after warning that full-year results will fall 'materially 
short' of its previous expectations as consumer spending slows in 2008, although the online fashion retailer swung 
to a maiden first-half pretax profit from a loss the year before.
However, management is adopting a cautious outlook for the wholesale division in 2008, given current consumer 
sentiment on the high street.
Elsewhere, Tadpole Technology shed 0-1/2 a penny to 2.88 pence, as it posted a full-year pretax loss, albeit 
narrowed to 0.34 mln stg from 6.84 mln a year ago, while Management Consulting stayed 1 penny off on 32-1/4 
pence, as its in-line trading update continued to be overshadowed by today's adverse market trend.
Reacting, Panmure Gordon cut its price target on the stock to 45 pence from 57 while keeping 'buy'.
Oilex stayed 5-1/4 pence to 64 pence after an update on the Oman exploration well failed to impress, while 
Sanatana Diamonds shed 5 pence to 67-1/2 pence, as it priced its private placement, announced Jan 14, at 1.35 
cad per unit and 1.55 cad per flow-through share, saying it expects to raise 9-10 mln cad instead of its original 
target of 13 mln.
Safestore Holdings dipped 2-3/4 pence to 150 pence, as the group's positive outlook was overshadowed by wider 
market weakness.
Chief executive Steve Williams said he thinks demand for self storage in the UK and France will continue to grow, 
despite a slowdown in the housing market, as the group posted like-for-like revenues up 14.1 pct to 72.6 mln stg, 
due to increases in occupancy, rates and ancillary revenues.
Reacting, Citigroup kept 'buy', noting that the group makes no reference to the difficult October experienced by rival 
Big Yellow.
Finally, London Scottish Bank dipped 0-1/2 a penny to 27-1/2 pence, as it updated on its impairment charge, saying 
it expects its impairment provision for the year to end-October to be in line with its own expectations.
Reacting, Shore Capital adjusted its 2007 figures while keeping 'hold' on the stock.

pct registered by traditional airlines.
Ryanair Holdings, Easyjet PLC and Air Berlin had 58.4 pct of passengers, while Vueling Airlines SA had 9.4 pct.
Iberia, Lineas Aereas de Espana SA's low cost arm, Clickair, occupied sixth place with 6.7 pct.
In 2007, low cost airlines transported almost 24 mln passengers, or 40 pct of the total market share, up 34 pct from 
a year earlier, the ministry said.

UK OFT clears easyJet's GB Airways acquisition

Body
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said it has cleared easyJet PLC's acquisition of GB Airways Ltd.
EasyJet agreed in October to acquire GB Airways and 28 London Gatwick slot pairs from Bland Group for 103.5 
mln stg in cash to expand its presence at Gatwick. The OFT said it has decided the merger raises no competition 
concerns in any market.
EasyJet and GB Airways overlap in the supply of scheduled passenger
flights on certain routes from London Gatwick airport to destinations popular with leisure travellers, such as the 
Balearic Islands and Innsbruck. GB Airways has operated these routes in accordance with a franchise agreement 
with British Airways PLC.
The OFT said this fact was significant in ruling out concerns based on the loss of potential competition on totally 
new routes in the future, because under the franchise agreement BA has a veto over GB Airways' new routes.
The OFT said it had initial concerns on overlap routes because the combined market shares were over 40 pct in 
every case. It added that there was some evidence to suggest that entry onto a route was difficult because it is hard 
to obtain additional capacity at London airports, or to move existing capacity from one route to another.
'This is a prime example of how actual entry on all overlap routes can clearly resolve initial concerns. These 
examples demonstrate that when it comes to these routes, easyJet and its rivals - such as BA, Ryanair and 
Monarch - have been able to overcome any barriers to entry at various London airports,' said Chloe MacEwen, the 
OFT's deputy director of mergers.

EU launches investigation into potential state aid to Ryanair at Aarhus airport

airport

Body
The European Commission says it has opened an investigation into potential state aid granted to Ryanair and a 
number of other airlines by Aarhus airport operator Aarhus Lufthavn A/S.
The investigation follows a complaint that the Danish airport operator granted state aid to various air carriers 
operating at Aarhus airport through discriminatory rebates on airport charges.
On the basis of the investigation, the commission will determine whether Aarhus Lufthavn A/S sets its airport 
charges independently from the public authorities, or whether the arrangements it has concluded with various 
airlines are in line with the market economy investor principle.
If either of these questions is answered positively, the airport charges at stake do not involve state aid, the 
commission says.
However, if the investigation finds aid was granted to airlines, the commission would need to determine whether it is 
compatible with the common market.

Aer Lingus Group's pilots union has been forced to withdraw its labour claims against Ryanair Holdings PLC after 
the IALPA/IMPACT unions failed to attend a scheduled hearing at the labour court today.
IALPA/IMPACT hoped to use the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004 to show Ryanair was underpaying its 
Dublin pilots. Ryanair, however, always maintained that the legislation did not apply to high pay multi-national 
companies such as itself. Ryanair won a Supreme Court case against IALPA/IMPACT last February.
'It is time that the trade unions in Ireland recognised that they have no role to play in high pay multi-national 
companies like Ryanair,' Ryanair's Eddie Wilson said in a statement.
IMPACT's Michael Landers said the union saw the ruling 'as no more than a temporary set back'.

Leading European shares are set to open slightly higher this morning, after a mixed session in the US yesterday 
with broker action a key focus on a relatively quiet news day.
Last night, the DJIA ended up 27.31 points, or 0.21 pct, at 12,827.49, after moving in and out of positive territory 
throughout the session as investors grew more confident that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again 
later this month to ward off recession
The market also contended with a resurgence of tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
The tech-focused Nasdaq composite index fell 5.19, or 0.21 pct, to 2,499.46.
Over in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed up 28.12 points, or 0.2 pct, at 14,528.67. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng 
finished the morning up 283.34 points or 1.04 pct at 27,462.83.
Oil prices were higher in morning Asian trade today, rebounding from overnight falls in New York on concerns over 
the United States economy.
In morning trade, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for February delivery gained 52 cents to 95.61 usd a 
barrel from 95.09 in late US trades Monday.
Brent North Sea crude for February was up 50 cents at 94.89 dollars a barrel.
Prices had briefly risen in US trading hours after the Pentagon said three US warships had been briefly harassed on 
Sunday by Iranian speedboats in the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial gateway for global energy supplies.
Back in Europe, Airlines will be in focus with traffic statistics out from Easyjet and Air France-KLM and as Ryanair 
hosts a conference in Milan today.
Three companies may be interested in buying Airbus SAS's Laupheim, Germany, operations. Concrete offers for 
the 1,100-employee factory may follow by mid-February. The three interested buyers are Diehl Group, Bremen-
based Kaefer and Zodiac, according to Handelsblatt.
M&A news is mostly dominated by posturing from Xstrata and Scottish & Newcastle as the former says the 
production targets set by its Australian takeover target Resource Pacific Holdings Ltd. aren't achievable and the 
Euroshares outlook - set to tick higher after modest Dow gains
brewing group says it commissioned an independent report which shows that joint venture Baltic Beverages was 
grossly undervalued when Carlsberg and Heineken NV made an informal offer for S&N in October.
Elsewhere, the Daily Telegraph said Portugal's Banco Espirito has acquired almost 10 pct of UK broker and 
investment bank Evolution Group Plc and may make a full takeover offer.
And Zurich Financial Services is reportedly considering buying a Taiwanese insurer to expand in the greater China 
region, reversing a strategy of shrinking its operations on the island. The insurer will review possible takeover 
targets among Taiwanese property insurance providers.
In other news, biotech group InterMune Inc said that phase 1b studies on potential hepatitis C drug ITMN-191, 
which it is developing in cooperation with Roche Holdings AG, have shown positive results.
The multiple ascending dose (MAD) study tested the drug's efficiency safety and tolerability at a 300 mg daily 
dosage as monotherapy.
Given the relatively thin newsflow, trade will likely be dominated by yet another slew of New Year broker changes.
Deutsche Bank upped Dassault Systemes and Atos Origin to 'buy' but cut Cap Gemini to hold'.
The broker also cut UBI Banca and Intesa SanPaolo to 'hold'.
Meanwhile, in a series of media sector reviews, UBS has cut Johnston Press and Yell to 'sell' and TF1 to 'neutral' 
but upped Havas and Lagardere to 'buy'.
Endesa has been upped to 'buy' at Citigroup.
And Credit Suisse has cut the European Telecoms sector to 'market weight' from 'overweight'.

Europe's leading exchanges rose in midday trade with Wall Street expected to post gains as the flight to safety 
continues with telecoms and healthcare plays posting solid gains once again.
At 12.30 am, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 Index was up 25.79 points or 0.72 pct at 3,619.76, while the DJ STOXX 
600 Index gained 2.34 points or 0.67 pct to 353.61.
Spread bettors IG Index said the Dow looks set to move 41 points up in opening deals, although a bearish note 
from Merrill Lynch suggesting Citigroup may have to make a 16 bln usd writedown in the fourth quarter capped 
enthusiasm.
Later, investors will be looking to see if Wall Street can overcome investor jitters over the US economic outlook to 
add to yesterday's first gains of the year.
Sentiment could take a knock with fresh data expected to confirm the US housing market remains in the doldrums.
The Pending Home Sales Index is expected to have fallen 0.5 pct in November after rising 0.6 pct in the prior 
month, according to the median estimate of economists polled by Thomson's IFR Markets.
Ongoing concerns about the state of the global economy and the banking sector, in particular, continued to weigh 
on the European banking sector.
RBS fell 2.51 pct amid re-emergent rumours it will make a rights issue, while Barclays fell 2.76 pct on vague talk it 
will be forced to make a write-down of underperforming assets.
Lloyds TSB slumped 3.1 pct as Morgan Stanley repeated its 'underweight' stance on the UK banking group, saying 
it is the most exposed UK large-cap bank to the domestic UK economy and has the biggest absolute and relative 
exposure to unsecured credit in the UK.
Societe Generale fell 2.53 pct, BBVA slipped back 1.98 pct and Deutsche Bank was 1.48 pct lower as investors 
remain cautious on the sector.
Euroshares up in midday trade as Dow seen posting gains, defensives up again
In other broker action of note, shares in Deutsche Post rose 3 pct after Morgan Stanley lifted its recommendation on 
the company to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight', saying it expects management changes while a share price level 
close to the 2000 IPO price of 21 eur have 'introduced a new urgency among management' to effect change.
The airline sector took a hit after a number of unimpressive traffic updates. Shares in EasyJet fell 9.73 pct after the 
company's December load factor fell 2.2 percentage points to 78.9 pct, compared to the same period a year ago.
Collins Stewart cut its rating on the shares to 'sell'.
Ryanair Holdings slumped 5.22 pct, hurt by the load factor decline of one of its main competitors. The company is 
also holding a conference in Milan today.
Air France-KLM erased morning gains to turn 2.53 pct lower as early enthusiasm about yields gave way to concern 
about the lacklustre outlook and high oil prices.
The media sector fared better. TF1 reversed opening losses to turn 12.93 pct higher as news of a UBS downgrade 
was outweighed by news the French government is considering banning ads on state TV channels.
A trader in Paris said ad revenues for state-owned TV channels total 700 mln eur and if ads on public TV are 
banned some of this spending will have to be redistributed among the privately owned channels. M6 also moved up 
on the news, adding 7.47 pct.
Shares in Premiere gained for a second day, up 2.09 pct, buoyed by rumours of a bid from either Vivendi or 
NewsCorp following yesterday News Corp has bought a 14.5 pct stake in the company.
Dresdner Kleinwort lifted its rating to 'buy' from 'hold' on the German Pay-TV group, saying it is unlikely News Corp 
will be content to remain a minority shareholder.
The broker pointed out the last time News had a stake in the business management highlighted that a key 
frustration in the run up to Kirch's bankruptcy was their lack of control.
Lagardere shares rose 4.3 pct after UBS upgraded the company to 'buy' from 'neutral'. The broker also lifted Havas 
-- up 1.56 pct -- to 'buy' from 'neutral'.
The staffing sector also posted solid morning gains, helped by an upbeat outlook from UK group Michael Page 
International.
Investec said today's update confirms trading in the fourth quarter has remained strong across the group, with little 
impact from the world credit crunch seen to date. The broker repeated its 'buy' stance saying shares in the sector 
have been badly hit by concerns over the outlook for 2008.
Michael Page was up 7.86 pct. Among other sector gainers, Hays rose 4.26 pct, Adecco added 1.45 pct while 
Randstad added 1.23 pct.
Selected tech stocks also posted gains with Atos Origin up 3.18 pct after it was upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold'.
Autonomy climbed 5.47 pct after it announced it has entered into OEM license agreements with Oracle and EMC 
for the license of its software. Singulus Technologies extended yesterday's gains -- rising a further 21.99 pct -- after 
the company's chief executive officer Stefan Baustert said in an interview he expects the company to win orders for 
at least 15 Blu-ray machines this year, three times more than last year.
And Fast Search & Transfer surged 38.58 after US computer giant Microsoft Corp made a 19 nkr cash bid for the 
group.

Ryanair Holdings PLC's proposal to set up operations at Milan's Malpensa airport have been rejected by SEA, the 
company that operates the airport, said Bridget Dowling, Ryanair's market and sales director for Southern Europe.
Last year, Ryanair proposed to SEA basing 15 aircraft at Malpensa and generating passenger traffic of 6 mln 
passengers per year.
'As far as Malpensa is concerned we have made an offer and it has not been accepted. Our door is always open,' 
for further talks with SEA, Dowling said, declining to go into details.
Alitalia SpA, also via its tie up with Air France-KLM, is planning to downscale its operations at Malpensa to have 
only one hub in Italy at Fiumicino in Rome.
Dowling said Italy is Ryanair's second-largest market and is aiming for 14 mln passengers in 2008, up from 12 mln 
in 2007, with the longer term goal of doubling routes and passengers over 5 years.

Polish treasury says could dump whole stake in LOT airline sell-off
Polish treasury says could dump whole stake in LOT airline sell-off

Poland could get rid of the entire stake it holds in national airline LOT after an initial public offering later this year 
and does not rule out selling part of the carrier to another airline, a deputy treasury minister said.
Zdzislaw Gawlik told Thomson Financial News in an interview that the public offering of LOT, in which the state now 
holds a 68 pct stake, is 'a foregone conclusion' and could take place in June or July.
'It's in the interest of the company, considering its investment needs, for the shares to start trading publicly as 
quickly as possible,' Gawlik said.
Like other flagship carriers, LOT has come under pressure from budget airlines such as WizzAir and Irish Ryanair, 
which have cut into its market share as thousands of Poles took to flying on holiday and as many as two million left 
to work abroad in recent years.
The airline has recently announced plans to open new links with Asia to offset growing competition on European 
and transatlantic routes and raise the net profit to 200 mln zlotys in 2012.
'When it comes to an initial public offering of LOT it will consist of a new share issue,' Gawlik said. 'We cannot rule 
out that a sector investor will take part in a privatisation.'
Gawlik said the government expects to reach an agreement later this month with the receiver of bankrupt SwissAir, 
which still controls a 25 pct stake in LOT.
The deputy treasury minister also said he saw no reason for the state to hold any shares in the national airline, but 
said cutting the treasury's stake in the carrier below 51 pct will require legal changes.
The move could prove tricky for the government as previous attempts to sell high-profile, state-owned assets have 
led to heated debates in parliament.
LOT, a member of the Lufthansa-led Star Alliance, flew 3.7 mln passangers and had a net profit of 539.8 mln zlotys 
in 2006, according to the most recent figures posted on its website.

NEW YORK (AP) - The holiday shopping season got off to an uneasy start as consumers took advantage of big

Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has called on the European Commission to block Air France-KLM's bid 
for rival Alitalia until both airlines have paid back a combined 2.7 bln eur in illegal state aid received from the French 
and Italian governments.
Last month, Ryanair lodged a case at the EU's second-highest court, the Court of First Instance, against the 
commission for its apparent failure to act on its complaint early last year about state aid it claims is being given to 
Air France.
This was followed by a further case lodged by Ryanair against Alitalia last week.
No one from the commission has so far been available for comment.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has lodged a further case in the European Court of First Instance against the 
European Commission for failing to act on its complaint about illegal State aid to Italian airline Alitalia-Linee Aeree 
Italiane Spa.
Ryanair claims the aid consisted of several measures, including a split-up of the company's assets and operations 
and uneven allocation of the debt, resulting in a 1.7 bln eur debt write-off for Alitalia.
The Dublin-based airline initially called on the Commission to investigate this incident two years ago.
This is the fifth case Ryanair has lodged against the European Commission in the European Court of First Instance. 
The others involve complaints about alleged state aid being granted to Air France-KLM, Deusche Lufthansa AG, 
Olympic Airways and Alitalia's subsidiary, Volare.

The European Commission said it has opened a formal investigation into contracts concluded by the Pau-Bearn 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIPB) with Ryanair and its subsidiary Airport Marketing Services Ltd.
The commission's investigation follows a notification by French authorities and relates to two different contracts. It 
said the two contracts appear to function as one agreement and the financing may constitute startup aid for the low-
cost airline.
In addition, the EU executive has concerns about whether the financing is in line with its rules on startup aids.
The first contract concerns the conditions for using the airport infrastructure at the airport of Pau, in the Pyrenees, 
France.
The second contract, concluded with Ryanair's subsidiary Airport Marketing Services Ltd, covers the conditions for 
providing marketing services to CCIPB in order to promote the air route in question.

Italian transport minister Alessandro Bianchi said Viterbo, in the Lazio region around Rome, has been chosen as 
the capital's third airport after Fiumicino and Ciampino airports.
The construction and management of the airport has been awarded to Gemina SpA unit Aeroporti di Roma, he said 
at a presentation with Lazio regional president Piero Marrazzo.
A Bianchi official said a major part of the Viterbo airport's activity is likely to be with low-cost carriers.
Bianchi has previously said establishing a third airport in the Rome area can relieve noise and environmental 
problems at Ciampino.
Last month, Ryanair Holdings PLC won a court suspension over measures taken by Italian regulators aimed at 
cutting flights at Ciampino.
In further comments, Rome mayor Walter Veltroni said Bianchi had taken the decision on the airport in the time 
scheduled, adding the new Viterbo airport will take pressure off Ciampino.
Viterbo was chosen against a series of technical criteria, including efficient rail links, he said.
Previously, Bianchi said the choice on the third airport also included those at Latina and Frosinone.
In its report on the choice of which of four existing airports to upgrade, the ministry said it also examined Guidonia 
to the east of Rome, closer to the capital than the other three.
Viterbo is to the north of Rome, while Latina and Frosinone are both south.
The ministry ranked the four candidates on capacity to increase the present airport's area, on ability to handle more 
air traffic, ground traffic links, and economic/financial factors, it said.
Viterbo won on lack of competition with other airports south of Rome and on easy upgrading of the rail link, while 
the other three face higher defence ministry costs in moving existing air traffic.
In 2020, Rome expects to handle 56 mln air passengers, including 46 mln at Fiumicino and not more than 3 mln at 
Ciampino, it said.
Italy chooses Viterbo as Rome's third airport; to be managed by AdR
'There is the need for a third airprot able to absorb 6-8 mln passengers by 2020,' the ministry said.
The ministry said it intends to examine other short-term measures to limit traffic at Ciampino after the court 
suspension obtained by Ryanair.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has lodged a case in the European Court of First Instance against 
the European Commission because of its failure to act on Ryanair's complaint that the Greek government provided 
illegal state aid to Olympic Airlines.
The Irish airline claims some 500 mln eur of illegal state aid was provided to Greece's national carrier by the Greek 
government through false arbitration proceedings involving services allegedly provided by Olympic to the Greek 
Government.
'The Greek government's most recent tranche of state aid to Olympic involves approximately 500 mln eur, mostly 
for 'unpaid services' allegedly provided by Olympic to the government. However, the Commission has refused to do 
anything about this since 2006, which left us with no alternative but to challenge the Commission's inaction in the 
European courts,' Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive said in a statement.

Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will today lodge a formal appeal with the EU Court of First Instance in Luxembourg as 
part of the legal process towards removing Ryanair Holdings PLC from its shareholder register.
If successful, the appeal would enable the EU Commission to order Ryanair to dispose of its 29.4 pct stake in its 
main competitor. The move comes after the EU Commission's recent decision that it does not have the legal 
authority to order a sell down of Ryanair's shares under merger regulation.
Aer Lingus said it is confident the regulation does, in fact, give the Commission that power as the stake was part of 
an original takeover attempt which the Commission prohibited.
The Irish flag carrier said it has also asked the court to make an order to prevent Ryanair from interfering in the 
running of its business pending judgement on the appeal.
'Aer Lingus is forging ahead with its plans for growth and refuses to be undermined by its competitor. It is our 
intention to deal with the presence of Ryanair on our shareholder register decisively through short-term interim 
measures, as well as seeking a speedy permanent resolution from the Court of First Instance,' John Sharman, Aer 
Lingus' chairman said in a statement.

Air France is suing Ryanair for 'slanderous accusations', the airline said.
Air France has filed a law suit against the Irish low-cost airline with the Bobigny court of first instance in France, and 
is seeking compensation for damages.
'Ryanair has broadly advertised to the press that it is launching proceedings with the European Commission 
denouncing the alleged collusion between Air France and two other European airlines,' Air France said.
'It is basing its complaint on the mere fact that Air France and the two airlines concerned increased their fares on 
the same day, a few hours apart, following implementation of a fuel surcharge,' it added.
Air France said it considers the facts 'slanderous accusations' not only because they are 'pure fabrication' but also 
because 'Ryanair deliberately leaked the accusations to the media.'

The European Commission said it is aware that Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has launched a court 
action under EU state aid rules for failure to act in connection will an allegation of state aid to German flag-carrier 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
Transport commissioner Jacques Barrot's spokesman said the the commission has not yet seen the content of the 
case lodged by Ryanair.
The commission said it has taken action on the Lufthansa issue and has written to the German authorities to 
request information and clarifications on Nov 18, 2005; July 31, 2006; June 6, 2007; and October 3, 2007.
Replies were received on Jan 18, 2006; Aug 8, 2006; Aug 28, 2007; Sept 17, 2007; and Sept 21, 2007, it added.
The spokesman said the commission is expecting a response from the German authorities to its last letter at the 
beginning of December, and that it is examining any possible advantage given in the context of a state aid 
investigation into the provision and operation of the Munich Airport Terminal 2 and inquiries in relation to this case 
are already at an advanced stage.
He added: 'Cases of this type are complex and take time -- a time-span of just under 18 months is not unusual. In 
these situations, the choice is often between investigating a case quickly and investigating the case correctly. The 
Commission will always opt for the latter.'
Earlier, Ryanair said it has started legal proceedings at the EU's second-highest court -- the Court of First Instance -
- alleging the commission failed to act on its complaint about the exclusive use of the terminal by Lufthansa and 
Star Alliance and called on the EU 'to start promoting competition'.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is 'confident' the European Consumer Affairs Commissioner, 
Maglena Kuneva's investigation into airline price advertising would prove its advertising was fair.
The EU consumer affairs watchdog carried out a probe in September and the results are set to be published 
tomorrow. It is believed around half of Europe's airlines, including Ryanair, could be forced to close their websites if 
they fail to iron out problems such as irregularities relating to price indications, contract terms and clarity of 
proposed conditions.
The results do not identify any airlines but the EC is set to publish a list of companies concerned in four months' 
time, sources say.
A commission spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports, but told Thomson Financial News: 'There will be 
no names tomorrow.'
Last month, a Spanish consumer rights group said it had found misleading ticket-related information on seven

Vueling Airlines SA largest shareholder Jose Manuel Lara has called on the no-frills carrier´s board to recognise the 
need to change the way the airline is managed ahead of an EGM on Nov 26.
Vueling chairwoman Barbara Cassani, or other board members, 'may have realized that the carrier needs a 
change,' giving hope of a dispute-free EGM, El Confidencial quoted him as saying.
Management had done well previously, 'but since the entry (into the Spanish market) of new competitors such as 
Ryanair and Clickair, they have made mistakes. It´s not acceptable to issue so many profit warnings,' he said.
At the beginning of October, Vueling cut its full-year guidance for the second time.
Vueling and Grupo Planeta's Inversiones Hemisferio, which Lara chairs, have been embroiled in a dispute over 
management strategy since Planeta representatives, including Lara, resigned from the carrier's board in October.
Recently, Hemisferio threatened legal action against board members. Vueling, in response, invited the group to 
raise its stake or even acquire the company.
Lara holds 26.8 pct of Vueling.
Separately, Lara confirmed that Miguel Zorita and Javier de Salas had invited him to enter the 'Spanish offer' for 
Iberia.
He added that he is focusing on Vueling for the moment.

UK's Darling seeks to ease concerns after Citigroup boss quits
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling sought to ease concerns that the 
turmoil in the US banking sector threatens the outlook for the UK economy.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Darling insisted that the prospects for the world economy, as well 
as the UK's, remain relatively healthy despite a moderation in the rate of growth.
Delta currently sitting on a loss of about 570 mln stg on Sainsbury stake
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Delta (Two) Ltd is sitting on a loss of about 570 mln stg from its 25 pct stake in J 
Sainsbury PLC, at the current share price, after pulling out of its proposed 10.6 bln stg takeover of the supermarket 
retailer earlier this morning.
The figure is greater than the 500 mln stg extra equity funding that Delta had asked its backer, the Qatari 
Investment Authority (QIA), to put into the deal -- a request that was apparently turned down.
Ryanair Holdings H1 pretax 459.5 mln eur vs 372.2 mln; ups FY guidance
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Low cost airline Ryanair Holdings posted pretax profits of 459.5 mln eur for the six 
months to Sept 30, against 372.2 mln for the same period in 2006, after passenger numbers grew by 20 pct to 26.6 
mln.
Interim profits after tax increased 24 pct to 407.6 mln eur and revenues also increased by 24 pct to 1.55 bln eur, it 
said, although yields fell by 1 pct. Unit costs increased by 5 pct, mainly due to higher fuel, staff, and airport costs, it 
said.

Data from the office for National Statistics showed manufacturing output, which makes up about 15 pct of the UK

2008-2012 period and reported nine-month to September earnings figures that were at the high end of forecasts.
Enagas led losers, falling 0.11 to 19.67, amid profit taking after recent outperformance and after Gas Natural said it 
has no plans to sell its stake in the company.
Union Fenosa fell 0.29 to 46.84 after selling 2 pct of Red Electrica de Espana (REE) at 38.80 eur per share. REE 
rose 0.07 to 39.07.
Amongst other energy issues, Gamesa rose 1.24 or 3.56 pct to 36.09, boosted by forecast-beating third quarter 
results from Danish peer Vestas Wind Systems.
Sogecable added 0.39 to 28.32, after a Spanish court ruled that Mediapro must pay the broadcaster's Audiovisual 
Sports unit for the rights to broadcast football league matches.
'This is the second court ruling in Sogecable's favour in the last few weeks and supports AVS' claim that it holds the 
exclusive rights to distribute the football matches' an analyst at a leading Portuguese bank said.
Sabadell was unchanged at 6.99, after the bank's Investor Day revealed aims for a return on equity of 20.5 pct, 
annual investment growth of 12 pct and a 500 mln eur rise in profits from ordinary activities by the same date.
Other banks mostly outperformed, with Santander adding 0.02 to 14.55 and BBVA rising 0.05 to 17.25.
Amongst small and medium caps, Vueling rose 0.15 to 16.10, after a solid set of traffic figures after yesterday's 
close and strong guidance from low-cost peer Ryanair.
Madrid shares higher in mid-session trade; Gas Natural up, Enagas down
Fadesa fell 1.20 or 4.82 pct to 23.70, after Cheuvreux downgraded it to 'underperform' from 'outperform' and also 
sharply cut the property company's estimates.

ROUNDUP Ryanair lifts FY forecast on higher H1; better yield outlook

Ryanair, the Dublin-based low-cost carrier, increased its full-year net profit forecast to 470 mln eur, from 440 mln 
eur, after it reported a 24 pct rise in net profits for the first half and said that the drop in yields this winter would not 
be as steep as previously expected.
Shares in the company retreated, however, as it warned that third-quarter net profits would be 'significantly lower' 
than the same period last year, reflecting lower ticket prices and a one-off contribution from the termination of its 
hotel partners last year.
The airline reported net profits of 407.6 mln eur for the six months to Sept 30, against 329.1 mln for the same period 
in 2006, on revenues up 24 pct to 1.55 bln eur. Pretax profits came in at 459.5 mln eur against 372.2 mln.
'We are very pleased with the first six months,' finance director Howard Millar told Thomson Financial News in a 
telephone interview. 'Passenger volumes are up 20 pct and profits are up 24 pct.'
The average ticket price fell 1 pct to 49 eur, in line with predictions that fares would be flat, chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said at a press conference in London.
But he said tickets prices for the next two quarters, guided by good visibility for the third quarter and some 
indications that the fourth quarter, in which Easter falls, would decline by about 5 pct, which is towards the lower 
end of the 5-10 pct fall previously signalled.
Some of the pricing power was down to the carrier taking seven aircraft out of service at Stansted in response to 
Grupo Ferrovial SA unit BAA's doubling of airport charges, making some routes unprofitable in winter, O'Leary said.
'The biggest increase in costs has been in airport charges,' he said. 'Higher airport charges are not justified, 
certainly not at Stansted.'
O'Leary was bullish on the other major cost increase facing the airline -- the higher price of fuel -- because fuel 
surcharges, which are shunned by Ryanair, drive customers to the low-cost carrier.
Ryanair is 90 pct hedged at 65 usd a barrel until the end of the financial year in March, and is also 10 pct hedged 
for the third quarter next year, but the group will probably go into next summer un-hedged, he said.
ROUNDUP Ryanair lifts FY forecast on higher H1; better yield outlook
'We welcome higher fuel charges for the next 12 months,' he said. 'Fuel surcharges result in a more benign yield 
environment. As long as we maintain the price differential we grow more strongly.'
O'Leary said despite higher fuel and airport costs, unit costs increase came in at 5 pct, lower than the company's 7 
pct target.
Strong growth in ancillary revenues, up 54 pct to 252 mln eur, contributed to a 3 pct increase in total revenue per 
passenger, Millar said.
Ancillary revenues grew by 54 pct to 252 mln eur, and now account for just over 16 pct of total revenues, he said.
The airline's decision to introduce charging for checking in at the airport had also been an 'amazing success', he 
added. 'We have changed customer behaviour very quickly, our web check-in numbers have doubled.'
Ryanair's new routes and bases performed well over the summer, O'Leary said, and this winter the airline will open 
130 new routes across Europe and new bases at Alicante and Valencia in Spain, Belfast City in Northern Ireland 
and Bristol in the UK.
A further one or two new bases for next summer will be announced in the coming weeks, he said, adding that he 
would be 'very surprised' if the carrier does not have a base in Eastern Europe by the end of next year.
The airline continued its share buyback programme by buying 53.5 mln shares at a cost of 267 mln eur over the last 
two months, representing about 3.5 pct of the company's share capital, finance director Millar said. 'We have 33 mln 
eur to go to complete the programme,' he said.
Ryanair's latest traffic figures, released this morning, showed an increase in both passenger numbers and load 
factor for October.
It carried 4.52 mln passengers in October, a rise of 21 pct from 3.73 mln in the same month last year, while the load 
factor -- a measure of how full its planes were -- rose to 85 pct from 83 pct.
In reaction to the interim numbers, Citigroup said the second-quarter results, including operating profit of 304 mln 
eur, were better than expected but in line with consensus.
It said higher fuel costs were a concern, but Ryanair was better placed than its competitors, because it is 90 pct 
hedged at 65 usd a barrel until March 2008, but very little after that. However, this is partly offset by the weak dollar 
and a better yield environment, Citigroup said.
Setting its 6.15 eur price target, the broker noted that the share price is on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 19.2 
times against a range of 15-25 historically.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank kept a 'buy' on Ryanair, saying it had already upgraded ahead of the company's 
guidance.
The broker noted that although first-half net income of 408 mln eur was ahead of consensus, yields, including bag 
handling revenues, fell by 0.6 pct in the second quarter, slightly less than its view.
The broker noted that Ryanair raised its guidance for full-year net income, citing winter yields as being better than 
previously forecast.
But while it envisages upgrades of 2-3 pct on consensus figures, the broker said it will leave its forecasts for 
Ryanair unchanged.
The company's shares had shed 0.27 eur, or 4.7 pct, to 5.48 eur at 4.08 pm.

MARKET SENTIMENT
-The broad market is expected to open lower, with fresh subprime worries weighing on sentiment after news of 
additional write-downs by Citigroup of 8-10 bln usd related to subprime lending.
'Sentiment is going to be nervous, and we could see the banks come under pressure on the back of the Citigroup 
news,' a trader at a leading international investment bank said.
'There's no reason to be buying,' he added.
Dealers noted an overall lack of newsflow to provide fresh leads today.
Over the rest of the week, domestic focus will be on some key blue chip companies quarterly earnings, as well as 
on Iberia's investor day, where any update on guidance and on the airline's Plan Director will be overshadowed by 
ongoing M&A speculation. A formal bid from TPG and BA has yet to emerge for the flag carrier, amid talk of 
growing interest on the part of a group of Spanish businessmen.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it carried 4.52 mln passengers in October, a rise of 21 pct from 3.73 mln in the same

The Irish low-cost airline said the load factor -- a measure of how full planes are -- rose to 85 pct from 83 pct.
The carrier said passenger numbers in the 12-month period to Oct 31 amounted to 47.71 mln, with a load factor of 
82 pct.
This morning, Ryanair announced net profits of 407.6 mln eur for the six months to Sept 30, a rise of 24 pct on the 
same period in 2006, after passenger numbers grew by 20 pct to 26.6 mln. It revised up its full-year net profits

Low cost airline Ryanair Holdings posted pretax profits of 459.5 mln eur for the six months to Sept 30, against 372.2 
mln for the same period in 2006, after passenger numbers grew by 20 pct to 26.6 mln.
Interim profits after tax increased 24 pct to 407.6 mln eur and revenues also increased by 24 pct to 1.55 bln eur, it 
said, although yields fell by 1 pct. Unit costs increased by 5 pct, mainly due to higher fuel, staff, and airport costs, it 
said.
The airline said its outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year remains cautious as it had very little visibility beyond 
the next two months.
But based on its current third quarter forward bookings and the impact of Easter in the fourth quarter, it anticipates 
that winter (H2) yields will be better than previously forecast with the expected yield declines being towards the 
lower end of the -5 pct to -10 pct range. As a result it estimates that full year net profits will rise by 17.5 pct to about 
470 mln eur rather than the 440 mln eur it previously guided.

Ryanair wins suspension of Rome's Ciampino airport flight curbs - report
Ryanair wins suspension of Rome's Ciampino airport flight curbs - report

Italy's state council, the country's highest administrative court, has suspended curbs on flights at Rome's Ciampino 
airport, meeting a demand from Ryanair Holdings PLC, said Radiocor.
Ryanair had lost its lower court appeal against an order by Italy's civil air regulator ENAC, which imposed a cut on 
overall flights at Ciampino to 100 a day from 138, the news agency said.
The state council will make its detailed ruling available on Nov 6, it said.
Ryanair told the court that Ciampino slot cuts would force it to cut 66 of its weekly 550 flights, with an annual loss of 
500,000 passengers, 500 jobs, and 125 mln eur in tourist spending, it said.
The regulator and regional Rome authorities have argued that the increased flights at Ciampino is causing noise 
and pollution, and favour shifting flights to a new low-cost airport in the area.

Passenger traffic at Polish airports jumped by a quarter in the first nine months of the year with regional hubs 
increasing their market share on the back of booming budget carriers, according to data from the local industry 
watchdog (ULC).
More than 14.6 mln passengers flew in and out of Poland from January through September with Warsaw's main 
Okecie airport still accounting for almost half of all the traffic, the data showed.
Balice, outside Poland's southern city of Krakow, was the second biggest airport in terms of traffic, followed by 
Pyrzyce near Katowice. Both airports cater mostly to low budget travellers.
ULC estimates passenger traffic at Polish airports will rise to 19 mln this year from 16 mln in 2006 and expects 
regional airports to increase its shares in the air traffic market as more passengers choose budget airlines, including 
Hungary-based Wizz Air and Irish Ryanair, over traditional carriers.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has filed with the Irish regulators a formal complaint against Aer Lingus for alleged 
regulatory breach.
Ryanair accused Aer Lingus of disclosing market sensitive information to one shareholder, the Department of 
Transport, weeks prior to a formal announcement to shareholders through a notice to the stock exchange. It 
submitted the complaint with the Irish Financial Regulatory Services Authority.
Ryanair is the largest shareholder of Aer Lingus which, in turn, is 25 pct owned by the Department of Transport.
'This appears to be a clear and flagrant breach of Stock Exchange rules by... Aer Lingus and we have asked the 
(regulators) to investigate this matter and take appropriate action,' Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory 
affairs, said.
'It is long past time that the Department of Transport stopped behaving as the downtown office of Aer Lingus, and 
that Aer Lingus stops treating the Department of Transport as its downtown head office,' he said.

The European Commission confirmed it is unable to force Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC to dispose of 
its 29.4 pct shareholding in flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
A spokesman for EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'A decision was adopted this morning by the 
commission confirming that, in the view of the commission, it is unable under the EU merger regulation to require 
Ryanair to reduce its minority stake in Aer Lingus.'
'Essentially, this is the case because the minority stake does not confer control and the merger regulation only 
allows the commission to intervene if a party has effective control of another company'.
'The decision was taken following a formal complaint from Aer Lingus against the commission for failure to act and 
therefore this decision rejects the Aer Lingus complaint,' he added.
Yesterday, Aer Lingus said it would start legal proceedings to force Ryanair to dispose of its minority stake.
The commission's decision allows Aer Lingus to make an appeal to the Luxembourg-based European Court of First 
Instance (CFI).
Aer Lingus said it believes EU merger regulation does, in fact, give the commission the power to force a stake sale 
because the stake was part of the original takeover attempt of the carrier by Aer Lingus which the commission 
blocked.
Aer Lingus said its application to the CFI will be made in the coming weeks.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has challenged a recent ruling by the French supreme court which sought 
to deny Ryanair's Marseille-based employees the right to rely on Irish labour law in their relationship with the Irish 
carrier.
Ryanair said the Decree (No 1425) forces its pilots and cabin crew operating international routes to and from 
France to be subject to French labour law, irrespective of the fact that they are working on Irish-registered aircraft 
and contracts.
The French supreme court earlier advised the French government on the legality of the Decree and rejected 
Ryanair's request to refer this matter to the European Court of Justice, ruling that the Decree was lawful. Ryanair 
said this denied it the right to fair trial and made it necessary for the airline to seek justice in the European Court of 
Human Rights.
'This was clearly in breach of French, European and international laws. Ryanair is committed to defending the rights 
of its employees, including the right of its employees operating on Irish territory to rely on Irish labour law, and has 
therefore challenged the legality of the Decree,' Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs and company 
secretary said in a statement.

Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC has said it will start legal proceedings to force Ryanair Holdings PLC to dispose 
of its 29.4 pct shareholding in the Irish flag carrier.
The move follows confirmation by Philip Lowe, the EU's director general for competition, that the European 
Commission will decide that it does not have legal authority to force the sale of Ryanair's stake following its decision 
to block Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus.
The Commission's decision allows Aer Lingus to make an appeal to the European Court of First Instance that 
would, if successful, enable the Commission to order Ryanair to dispose of its stake in the Irish flag carrier.
Aer Lingus said it believes EU merger regulation does, in fact, give the Commission the power to force a stake sale 
because the stake was part of the original takeover attempt which the Commission blocked. Aer Lingus said its 
application to the Court of First Instance will be made in the coming weeks.
In a statement released today, Aer Lingus said it would also ask the court to make an order preventing Ryanair from 
interfering in the running of Aer Lingus' business pending judgment on the appeal.
'We are fully prepared to face competitive opposition on the runways and despite its attempts to portray us 
otherwise, a strong, independent and competitive Aer Lingus is an issue for Ryanair, particularly out of Dublin. 
Since this time last year, Ryanair has pursued every available tactic to prevent the further development of Aer 
Lingus as a competitive force, in order to defend its own patch out of Dublin,' John Sharman, Aer Lingus' chairman, 
said in a statement.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has reached agreement with its Dublin based pilots on a new four-year pay 
and rostering deal.
Ryanair said the deal would significantly improve pay, rosters and terms and conditions for the carrier's Dublin-
based pilots. The move brings the airline's pilots into line with the pay and conditions previously negotiated by 
Ryanair pilots at its other Irish bases.
The agreement was concluded following proposals which were put to the airline by the Dublin pilots, which were the 
subject of recent negotiations, and have now been voted on and approved by a majority of Ryanair's Dublin-based 
pilots. Ryanair has accepted these proposals and will implement the improved rosters, increased pay and 
allowances with effect from 14 October.
'We are pleased that this new four year Dublin pilot pay deal will see our Dublin pilots enjoy substantial pay 
increases of over 25,000 eur per annum for Captains and over 15,000 eur for First Officers,' Ryanair's director of 
personnel, Eddie Wilson said in a statement.
'The new rosters will guarantee Ryanair's pilots a further 25 days off each year. This new agreement brings 
Ryanair's Dublin pilots back into line with the pay and conditions previously negotiated by Ryanair pilots at our other 
Irish bases such as Cork and Shannon,' he added.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has consulted its legal team over Aer Lingus Group PLC's rejection of Ryanair's 
second request for the airline to hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting about the Irish flag carrier's Shannon-
Heathrow services.
Aer Lingus plans to end Shannon-Heathrow services in January, saying they are its least profitable route. But 
Ryanair, which owns a 29.4 pct stake in Aer Lingus, claims the second rejection of an EGM to discuss the matter is 
'unlawful'.
'We have referred this unlawful behaviour to our legal advisors and will consider with them whether we should 
pursue our shareholder rights under the Companies Act 1963 or through the Courts. In the interim we will continue 
to closely monitor the actions of the board and management of Aer Lingus Group PLC,' Ryanair company secretary 
Jim Callaghan said in a letter to Aer Lingus released today.
Earlier this month, Aer Lingus threw out a second request from Ryanair to convene an EGM to force the Irish flag 
carrier to retain its Shannon-Heathrow services, which are due to be replaced by Belfast-Heathrow services on Jan 
14 2008.
At the time, Aer Lingus said in a statement it had written to Ryanair rejecting the request, saying it believes the no-
frills carrier wanted to 'interfere with and frustrate the commercial and operational performance of Ryanair's most 
resilient competitor'.

Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA is looking to hand over its less-profitable, short-haul routes out of Madrid to its 
20-pct owned no frills unit Clickair, El Economista reported, citing unnamed sources close to the matter.
Clickair currently operates out of Barcelona airport.
Iberia's move is an offensive against low cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair which are eating away at the 
flag carrier's market share.
The Spanish flagship is focusing now on more profitable, long-haul routes out of Madrid's Barajas airport.
Industry sources have said that in its 2006-2008 strategic plan, Iberia has already factored in a loss in passenger 
traffic of up to 14 pct in the domestic market.
El Economista carried denials from both Iberia and Clickair that the low-cost carrier could start operating out of

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is considering legal options in its row with Aer Lingus Group PLC about the Irish flag 
carrier's Shannon-Heathrow services as it reported trading in line with expectations.
Ryanair said it is exploring the legal remedies available to it after Aer Lingus refused to grant its request for an 
extraordinary meeting to discuss its plans to axe the services and replace them with Belfast-Heathrow flights.
Describing the refusal as 'unlawful' in a statement accompanying its annual meeting, the no-frills airline said: 'Since 
the directors of Aer Lingus are willing to repeatedly breach their statutory obligations towards their largest 
shareholder, there clearly isn't any influence Ryanair can bring to bear on this profitable route closure.
'Accordingly, we are considering what legal remedies are available to us.'
Ryanair said current trading continues to perform as expected, and advance bookings for the autumn are in line 
with its targets. It said it continues to believe winter yields will be down by between 5-10 pct.
'Accordingly our full year guidance is unchanged,' it said. It added that it expects passenger volumes to grow by 18 
pct to 50 mln passengers and to deliver profit growth of 10 pct, due to the softness in winter yields, rising fuel costs 
and the doubling of passenger charges at London Stansted airport.
Ryanair also said it was talking to Amsterdam Schiphol airport about launching a new Shannon-Amsterdam route.

Aer Lingus Group PLC said it had rejected a second request from Ryanair Holdings to convene an extraordinary 
shareholders meeting to force the Irish flag carrier to retain its Shannon-Heathrow services.
Aer Lingus said in a statement that it was rejecting the request, saying it believes the no-frills carrier's aim is to 
'interfere with and frustrate the commercial and operational performance of Ryanair's most resilient competitor.'
Aer Lingus is planning to end flights from Shannon to Heathrow in January, saying they are its least profitable route.

Infrastructure minister Antonio Di Pietro asked Alitalia SpA to reconsider plans to reduce activities at the Milan 
airport of Malpensa, where he said 20 bln eur have already been invested.
In a interview with the La Repubblica daily, the minister said he would not oppose putting Alitalia into bankruptcy 
and that the issue of job cuts has to be addressed in order to save the airline.
Di Pietro also welcomed Ryanair Holdings PLC's 1 bln usd proposal to set up operations at Malpensa and the 
possibility that Italian airline Air One might tie up with Alitalia.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is ready to invest 1 bln usd over 2008-2012 at Milan's Malpensa airport, if the SEA 
airport operating company offers suitable fees and operating conditions.
Ryanair is making its offer because Alitalia SpA is planning to move flights away from Malpensa, cutting about half 
of its 340 daily flights.
'Malpensa needs to attract companies that are able to achieve growth, and no air company can equal Ryanair in 
offering attractive growth, thanks to lower tariffs than those of Alitalia,' said Ryanair.
Ryanair's offer includes investment of 840 mln usd in 12 aircraft based at Malpensa and the launch of 50 
international routes from Malpensa, it said.
The offer comes ahead of meeting tomorrow in Dublin between Ryanair and SEA.
Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard said SEA has to offer tariffs competitive with other airports where Ryanair 
operates, as well simple operating facilities enabling quick turnaround of aircraft.
Ryanair's brand of short-haul can boost growth at Malpensa, drawing on the Milan catchment, which is an 
undeveloped market in the air sector compared to similar size metropolitan areas like London, he said.
In addition to the 840 mln usd of aircraft, delivered in 2008-2010, Ryanair would hire pilots and crew, he said, 
adding that expansion at nearby Bergamo airport will continue whatever happens on Malpensa.
'If we don't go to Malpensa fine. We continue to grow at Bergamo and the aircraft will go elsewhere,' he said.

Italy's struggling national carrier Alitalia said late last night its net loss narrowed marginally in the first half of the 
year but it still has enough cash reserves to keep flying for another year while new management seeks a buyer.
In a statement, the 49.9-pct-state-owned airline said its first-half net loss was 211.1 mln eur, a slight narrowing from 
the 220.2 mln loss reported in the same period a year earlier. Alitalia didn't disclose details for the second quarter.
The company said first-half revenue edged up 3.1 pct in the first half to 2.31 bln eur from 2.24 bln a year earlier, but 
operating costs grew 3 pct to 2.44 bln eur from 2.37 bln.
While fuel costs dropped 1.5 pct in the half, personnel costs grew 14 percent as the airline hired more staff in line 
with previously struck labor agreements.
The Rome-based company did not comment on progress in new Chairman Maurizio Prato's search for a buyer in 
the wake of the government's failed attempt to auction its stake earlier this year.
Earlier Wednesday, Alitalia denied Italian press reports that it was in high-level talks with Air France-KLM, which 
has often been put forward by analysts as a likely buyer for the company.
Prato said earlier this month that, in association with the airline's financial adviser, Citigroup Inc., he intends to 
sound out all potential suitors by the end of September. These include private equity house TPG Inc., privately 
owned Italian airline Air One, and Russian flag carrier Aeroflot, all of which have previously expressed interest in 
the airline.
Alitalia's plight has been exacerbated by the rapid growth of low-cost carriers like Ryanair and easyJet, and by 
persistent labor unrest, as powerful unions seek guarantees over future staffing despite management's attempts to 
broach the issue of restructuring.
Alitalia reported last month that the company's net debt was 1.05 bln eur at the end of July, while its market 
capitalization has slipped about 20 pct since the start of the year to just under 1.2 bln eur.

No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings said it is launching five routes from Basel-Mulhouse airport in France next month.
Ryanair said flights to Stockholm-Skavsta, Barcelona-Girona, Alicante in Spain, Valence in France and Dublin will

The Dublin-based carrier said it was offering 50,000 free tickets to mark the launch and 20,000 passengers had 
already made reservations on the new services.
Basel-Mulhouse airport is in France, in the tri-national Upper Rhine region near Switzerland and Germany.
Meanwhile, Air France said it was launching a Strasbourg-London service offering three return flights a day on Oct 
28, according to the regional organisation Communaute Urbaine de Strasbourg.
Air France subsidiary City Jet will operate the service between Entzheim airport and London City airport.

The European Commission said it has opened an inquiry into aid earmarked by regional Italian government for 
Alghero airport, Italy.
The support would have been granted by the Sardinia Region and SOGEAAL SpA, the publicly owned company 
operating Alghero airport, to various air carriers, and by the Sardinia Region to SOGEAAL SpA.
The commission's investigation will focus around three separate aspects. It will investigate agreements between 
SOGEAAL and Irish air carrier Ryanair Holdings concerning marketing support and other contributions.
It will also investigate a number of handling fee rebates that are allegedly granted to low-cost air carriers at Alghero 
airport. The EU executive will also consider whether financial support and compensation granted to SOGEAAL SpA 
for its operating losses and capital increase constitutes state aid in favour of the airport operator.
The commission launched this investigation following a complaint from a competing airline.

Irish carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC said it is 'in no doubt' that Ryanair's appeal against the European Commission's 
decision to block its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus would fail.
Ryanair yesterday said it had submitted an appeal to the European Court of First Instance (CFI) in Luxembourg 
against what it described as the commission's 'unlawful and politically motivated decision' to block its merger with 
the Irish flag carrier.
Ryanair made a 2.80 eur per share offer to acquire Aer Lingus following the former national airline's flotation last 
October. However, Aer Lingus backed the EC's decision to block the takeover.
'The Commission's investigation, which took account of the interests of all relevant parties, particularly those of 
consumers, confirmed the position of Aer Lingus that competition and, as a result the Irish travelling public, would 
suffer if a merger of the two largest airlines operating out of Dublin airport was permitted to take place,' said Aer 
Lingus in a statement.
It argued the takeover would have resulted in an immediate reduction in Aer Lingus fares, reduced costs and 
increased efficiency and punctuality. It also pledged to retain Aer Lingus as a separate brand and to keep all its 
profitable routes.
However, the commission said in June, when it confirmed its decision, it believed the combination would harm 
consumers and would reduce competition by creating a monopoly on 22 routes and a dominant position, with a 
market share of more than 60 pct on a further 13.
It said the deal would have reduced choice and probably have led to higher prices for more than 14 mln passengers 
in the EU using those routes to and from Ireland each year.
The EU executive also said the proposed remedies offered by Ryanair during the investigation were 'inadequate' 
and 'insufficient'.

Ryanair Holdings PLC could be interested in take-off and landing slots at Milan's Malpensa airport, which Alitalia 
SpA could give up, said Alessia Viviani, Ryanair sales and marketing manager for Italy.
Newspaper reports say that Alitalia plans to cut 150-170 of its daily 340 flights from Malpensa airport as part of a 
scaling down of this hub in a business plan to turnaround the airline.
'We invite Malpensa airport to come to Dublin to talk about new routes, and possible plans,' said Viviani, referring to 
Ryanair's Irish headquarters.
Viviani gave no further details on the invitation for SEA, the company which operates Milan's Malpensa and Linate 
airports, to meet Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary.
All the same, Ryanair continues its policy of operating from cheaper, secondary airports, such as at Bergamo, near 
Milan, where it has sufficient space for its expansion plans, she said.
'We invite Malpensa to come for a meeting. Then we see. Italy is important for Ryanair. Everything is possible,' she 
said.
Italy is Ryanair's second largest market after the UK, representing 16-17 pct of overall group activities, she said.

Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC today officially rejected a request by minority shareholder, Coinside, on behalf of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC, to convene an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of the company.
In the official letter rejecting the request, Aer Lingus said Ryanair's EGM proposal would breach competition law.
'It is clear that, in calling for an EGM to consider the two resolutions set out in your letter, coupled with the content 
of the statements made by Ryanair to the Stock Exchange, Ryanair is attempting to influence and co-ordinate the 
strategic conduct of Aer Lingus, its closest competitor, in circumvention of the Commission's recent prohibition 
decision and in clear breach of Irish and European competition law,' wrote Laurence Gourley, Aer Lingus' company 
secretary in a letter to Ryanair.
Ryanair launched a failed bid for Aer Lingus last October, shortly after the Irish flag carrier was floated in 
September, at 2.80 eur a share, valuing the group at 1.48 bln eur.
Earlier this month Ryanair acquired a further 4 pct stake in Aer Lingus, taking its holding in its Irish competitor to

According to La Libre Belgique, the text states its aim as 'guaranteeing social harmony' at the airport.
The agreement comes following reports last week that Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair was to suspend flights from the 
airport from November following a series of 'wildcat' strikes.
The airline told La Libre Belgique that it was satisfied with the agreement and would resume the sale of flights from

Low-cost airline Ryanair is to start charging 2 stg or 3 eur to check in at the airport from September 20 to encourage

Web check-in will be free for passengers travelling with hand luggage only and will include priority boarding at the 
departure gate, the airline said, but passengers who want to use airport check-in facilities will pay the charges.
Ryanair said the move would discourage passengers from checking in bags or using airport check-in queues.
'These new measures will, we believe, encourage more and more passengers to travel without checked-in baggage 
and use Ryanair's free web check-in and priority boarding service,' a company spokesman said.
'These passengers will do so entirely free of charge, whilst avoiding the check in queues and being among the first

The European Commission declined to comment today on whether Ryanair Holdings will have to pay back state aid 
it received from the Wallonian government in Belgium for flights it will now not run from its hub at Charleroi near 
Brussels.
The Irish low-cost airline signed a ten-year deal in 2005 committing itself to investment in the airport and currently 
receives tax exemptions and landing fee aid from the region.
Yesterday, the carrier said it is suspending flights from the airport from November 12 because of the risk of wildcat 
strikes, and asked the Wallonian government to resolve the situation with its workers.
A commission spokesman added that he did not consider Ryanair's actions to be blackmail aimed at undermining 
airport workers' right to strike.
The spokesman said the dispute is an issue between a private company and the government of Wallonia and is not 
related to EU legislation on the right to strike.
Separately, the commission said that a 2003 decision on state aid previously given to Ryanair, which required the 
airline to repay funds, is currently being appealed at the European Court of Justice.
The funds are currently frozen in a bank account pending the court's decision.

UK advertising regulators have banned advertisements by Ryanair Holdings which claimed that its flights from 
London to Brussels are faster and cheaper than trains run by high speed international rail operator Eurostar, 
according to a report.
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the adverts were misleading because they ignored the time taken 
travelling from city centres to airports, the BBC reported.
The ASA also said that Ryanair had failed to take into account the extra costs of getting to and from the airports.
Ryanair's advert compared its 70-minute flight between Stansted and Charleroi airports to a 131-minute train 
journey between Waterloo in central London and Brussels Midi in the centre of the Belgian capital, the BBC said.
Ryanair defended itself, telling the BBC that the time and costs involved in getting to an airport or railway station 
were 'irrelevant' as they applied to both modes of transport.

Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings is suspending flights from its hub at Charleroi near Brussels from November 12 
because of the risk of wildcat strikes at the airport, it said in a statement.
Security staff at Charleroi staged a wildcat strike over the weekend of June 15-17 causing the cancellation of 
thousands of Ryanair flights, and the airline said it was stopping all bookings until the issue was resolved.
Ryanair said Charleroi Airport had assured it that it was tackling the staff grievances.
'However, Ryanair is determined to ensure that its flights and passengers at Charleroi will not be cancelled again 
and so there must be an effective contingency plan in place to keep this international airport open and operational 
even if some staff wish to engage in wildcat strikes in the future,' it said.
Flights to and from the airport in August, September and October are unaffected by the suspensions, it said.

Madrid shares were flat in thin midday trade with the main banks on a rebound, while other heavyweights were 
mixed and builders fell across the board.
At 12.00 pm, the IBEX-35 index rose 14.50 points to 13,994.20.
Equities opened lower but quickly turned higher after a late US surge yesterday, but modest gains were eroded 
over the morning as continuing volatility on credit concerns weighed.
Main banks rose on a rebound, with BBVA putting on 0.17 eur to 16.70, and Santander adding 0.14 to 13.15.
Other heavyweights were mixed, with Telefonica slipping 0.05 to 17.12, while Repsol YPF rose 0.08 to 26.09.
Iberia dropped 0.07 or 2.23 pct to 3.07 after low-cost carrier Ryanair announced plans yesterday to open four new 
European routes from Madrid.
Separately, BNP Paribas cut its stance on the Spanish flagship to 'underperform' from 'neutral', with a new target 
price of 2.80 eur from 3.60. It noted that potential buyer TPG may use the current credit concerns to its advantage, 
offering a bid much lower than the 3.60 indicative bid tabled earlier this year.
Gamesa reversed yesterday's sharp losses to gain 0.42 to 26.65.
Among defensives, selective utilities slumped after outperforming yesterday, with Union Fenosa dropping 0.47 to 
37.28, Gas Natural slipping 0.60 to 37.76 and Iberdrola losing 0.56 to 38.40.
Inditex slipped 1.65 to 40.65, extending recent weakness in the wake of lower than expected July sales growth at 
peer H&M earlier this week.

Low cost airline Ryanair is believed to have spent 37.6 mln eur yesterday increasing its stake in Aer Lingus to 28 
pct from 25.2 pct, according to the Irish Times.
The airline bought 16 mln shares at 2.35 eur each from an unnamed seller, the newspaper said.
The purchase would make Ryanair the largest shareholder in Aer Lingus, ahead of the Irish Government, which has 
25 pct, and the employee share ownership trust, which own 12.6 pct.
Ryanair launched a failed bid for Aer Lingus last October, shortly after the Irish flag carrier was floated in 
September, at 2.80 eur a share, valuing the group at 1.48 bln eur.
A Ryanair spokesman would not confirm the latest purchase, saying the company never commented on stock 
market rumours.

Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has offered to provide three additional flights between Shannon and London 
if Aer Lingus PLC proceeds with its plan to close the Shannon-Heathrow route.
In the event that Aer Lingus sticks to its decision Ryanair today said it would provide three additional daily flights to 
London to ensure Shannon Airport's capacity and traffic does not fall as a result of this Aer Lingus closure. Ryanair 
said it would be willing to launch a fourth daily flight to London Stansted, a second daily flight to London Gatwick 
and a daily flight to London Luton if Aer Lingus pulls its London services from Shannon.
Ryanair also said it had yesterday written to Aer Lingus requesting that an EGM be called, 'to allow Aer Lingus 
shareholders the opportunity to exercise their statutory right to consider requesting the Board and Management of 
Aer Lingus to reverse the Shannon closure decision and maintain Aer Lingus's 4 daily flights between Shannon and 
Heathrow.'
Ryanair also said it would be willing to vote its 25 pct shareholding in favour of the motion to retain Aer Lingus's 
existing Shannon-Heathrow services.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive said in a statement: 'Aer Lingus's rules confirm that any 10 pct 
shareholder can ask for an EGM to be called. It is surprising that neither the government nor the trade unions, both 
of whom own over 10 pct, have taken up Ryanair's previous offer to work together or called for an EGM to be held.
'Accordingly and in the interests of retaining a profitable route for the benefit of all Aer Lingus shareholders, Ryanair 
has asked Aer Lingus to call an EGM and we will be asking the trade unions and Bertie Ahern's government to 
support this motion calling for Shannon's daily flights to Heathrow to be maintained.'

Ryanair Holdings PLC is to challenge in the Italian courts a requirement to move flights from Rome's Ciampino 
airport, effective from the winter season, said Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.
In July, the Italian authorities decided to cut total daily flights out of Ciampino to 100, from 138, in a move they said 
was aimed at cutting noise and pollution for local residents.
O'Leary said the move was 'the latest illegal attempt to block low-cost carriers and competition', and aimed at 
supporting Alitalia SpA.
If the Ciampino move goes ahead, Ryanair will have to cut about 12 pct of its flights, or about 66 a week, he said.
In July, transport minister Alessandro Bianchi said the move would affect about one mln Ryanair passengers, and 
suggested the low-cost airline should move to Rome's main Fiumicino airport.
O'Leary reiterated that Ryanair does not intend to move flights to Fiumicino and threatened to take the airline's 
activities away from Rome.
However, O'Leary said he would consider an alternative airport, such as nearby Viterbo, Frosinone and Latina, if 
they materialise.
Previously, Ryanair officials have said these airports don't have suitable runways for Ryanair aircraft.
O'Leary said that in addition to the Italian court complaint, Ryanair is appealing the Ciampino decision to the 
European Commission, 'asking immediately for it to intervene in favour of consumers'.

Ryanair Holdings PLC CEO Michael O'Leary said rival airline Alitalia SpA needs restructuring, and he would not 
buy the airline even if it was being given away for free.
In the last few days, there have been unconfirmed reports that new Alitalia chairman Maurizio Prato is planning 
contacts with possible partners, including Air France KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
'Alitalia is a mess. We would not buy it even if they gave it to us,' O'Leary said at a news conference in Rome.
Alitalia's problems 'will not be resolved until they eliminate the political influences' on the company, he said.
Alitalia could be privatised but not with this highly trade-unionised model of operations, he said.
The Italian flag carrier could have a future but it needs to be restructured and costs cut, he said.
The Italian government owns 49.9 pct of Alitalia and tried to sell its stake in an auction process, but all the potential 
buyers dropped out because of the tough conditions for the buyer.
The government has turned the task of finding a partner for the airline over to Prato.

Ryanair to open new Spanish bases in Valencia and Alicante - report
Ryanair to open new Spanish bases in Valencia and Alicante - report

Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, is establishing two new Spanish bases in Valencia and Alicante, 
reports the Financial Times.
The Irish carrier is thought to be close to finalising deals in both cities, the newspaper said.
Ryanair has a base in Barcelona-Girona, with nine aircraft and 49 routes, and opened another in Madrid in 
November, which has five aircraft and 15 routes to date. The Spanish network was forecast to rise to 9 mln 
passengers a year, including the Madrid base.
Ryanair's move will intensify the battle for the Spanish market, the main focus for the expansion of low-cost carriers 
in Europe after the UK and Germany, the FT said.
The competitiveness of the market was underlined last week when low-cost carrier Vueling Airlines SA issued a 
profit warning after a disappointing set of first half figures.
Vueling flagged that the impact on earnings of pricing pressures from increased competition was greater than it had 
expected in the second quarter, when average fares declined 23.4 pct from a year earlier.

RBS H1 profit up 11 pct
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK bank leading a consortium seeking to buy Dutch

11 pct on the same period last year.

Ryanair chief O'Leary repeats calls for BAA break-up
Ryanair chief O'Leary repeats calls for BAA break-up

Ryanair Holdings chief executive Michael O'Leary today repeated calls for airport operator BAA to be broken up.
A torrent of criticism from airlines and consumers prompted the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to refer Ferrovial-
owned BAA to the UK's Competition Commission (CC) in March. The CC investigation into the group's activities is 
ongoing, with a decision expected in Dec 2008.
The decision to probe the services of the owner of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, followed a public 
consultation by the OFT after the watchdog proposed to refer BAA to the commission in December last year.
At a press conference in London this morning O'Leary told reporters BAA should be 'split up because the monopoly 
is damaging British travel.'
'Ryanair would like to see Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted compete against one another because this would force 
them all to improve. If we had real competition between the three there would be more runway capacity and airport 
management would be more responsive to passenger needs,' said the Ryanair boss.
O'Leary singled out Stansted airport -- Ryanair's British hub -- for special criticism, claiming the security systems 
and staffing procedures at the airport were inept.
'A great deal of Ryanair flights at Stansted are delayed because people can't get through security in time. This is 
because all the security machines need to be on and not just 14 out of the 20 and they also need to roster staff in a 
more sensible way because there are often not enough staff working to help people to their flights on time,' said 
O'Leary.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which regulates BAA's activities, also came under fire. O'Leary said the CAA 
was allowing BAA to 'constrain capacity into London' to keep prices high and accused the regulatory regime of 
'working against passengers because they are rewarded for waste.'

Europe's biggest low-cost carrier Ryanair is learnt to be conducting due diligence on Indian airline SpiceJet Ltd, The 
Times of India reported.
SpiceJet is trying to raise 40 mln usd to fund its expansion plans and is mulling over launching overseas services, 
the paper said, adding that the carrier plans to increase its fleet strength to 18 by next year, from the current 11.
According to Indian rules, a foreign airline cannot invest directly in an Indian carrier but its promoters can buy 
shares in their individual capacity, subject to a condition that a 51 pct stake is held by Indians.
Declan Ryan of the Ryan family, who started the airline in 1985, has held talks with SpiceJet management, the 
paper said.
SpiceJet denied that it was looking at Ryan for investment. 'Declan Ryan and another board member of his airline 
were going from London to Australia to attend Tiger Airline's board meeting. We requested them to stopover here 
and look at our model, if there are ways we can further improve our cost efficiency, which is anyway the lowest in 
India,' the paper quoted SpiceJet chief executive Siddhanta Sharma as saying.
Sharma said the airline will continue operating as a standalone model.

Pisa airport operator SAT to cut debt after IPO, sees 3.5 mln passengers in 2007
Pisa airport operator SAT to cut debt after IPO, sees 3.5 mln passengers in 
2007

MILAN (Thomson Financial) - Societa Aeroporto Toscano Galileo Galilei SpA will use the nearly 20 mln eur it 
expects to raise from its IPO to cut debt, finance investments to develop the Pisa airport, of which it is the operator, 
and promote traffic to Tuscany, said SAT chairman Pier Giorgio Ballini at the IPO presentation.
Passengers at the Pisa airport, which is the third Italian base of the low-cost airline Ryanair, are expected to rise to 
3.5 mln this year from 3 mln in 2006, and 1 mln in 1997, before the market was deregulated, Ballini said.
Ballini said SAT wants to make the Pisa airport the 'natural gateway' to Tuscany and that it is seeking partnerships 
with low-cost and traditional airlines to increase flights and passengers by co-investing in commercial initiatives.
'Tuscany is one of the most interesting places in Italy and the world. SAT is the only airport that can sell this region 
to a big number of passengers,' Ballini said.
In the long term, the airport's potential maximum capacity could be raised to 8 mln passengers, depending on the 
evolution of the market, he added.
Last year, the airport offered flights to 48 destinations in Europe run by 22 airlines, half of which were low-cost 
carriers, and since June it is offering a Delta Airline's non-stop flight to New York, the only one linking Tuscany 
directly to the US.
Ryanair, which Ballini described as 'trigger of our growth', contributed some 24 pct to SAT's overall revenues in 
2006, while the contribution of Italian flag carrier Alitalia SpA fell to 6.7 pct last year from the about 66 pct it had 
before the market was deregulated nine years before.
Company officials said the cargo businesses is also a strategic one.
Net debt surged to 8.4 mln eur at the end of the first quarter, compared to 5.6 mln end-2004, and the objective is to 
have a debt to equity ratio of 1 to 1 in 2009, SAT finance director Marco Forte added.
Current investment projects include the expansion of the stopover area for civil and military aircraft, worth 9.8 mln 
eur, and the implementation of a luggage selection and control system, needed for the flight to New York, worth 4 
mln.
Pisa airport operator SAT to cut debt after IPO, sees 3.5 mln passengers in 2007
Capital expenditure rose to 16 mln eur in 2006 from 9.4 mln in 2004.
On rewarding shareholders, Ballini said the company will continue paying out 20-25 pct of its net profits every year 
in dividends.
Company officials added that SAT is likely to book a profit also this year, despite booking a net loss in the the first 
quarter.
In the first quarter, SAT turned to a net loss of 348,000 eur from a profit of 250,000 a year earlier, due to costs to 
develop the Ryanair base and the impact of the 2006 financial law, while the year-earlier figure benefited from a 
shutdown at the Firenze airport, which is only 80 kilometres far away.
In 2006, net profit was 2.8 mln eur, against 2.6 mln in 2005, on sales of 43.5 mln, against 36.4 mln, and EBITDA of 
9.4 mln, against 7.9 mln.
Asked about plans by transport minister Alessandro Bianchi to reform airports legislation, Ballini said: 'I'm not to 
much worried about'.
Bianchi has proposed legislation to classify airports as international, regional, and low cost for tourists, which he 
said last week should be implemented by the year end.
The rules would allow airports to invest in one or other category, avoiding the present indiscriminate development of 
new airports in each region, he said.
Until Friday, SAT will be offering 1.86 mln shares, the most stemming from a capital hike, at 9.50-12.50 eur each, a 
figure which values the company at up to 121 mln eur after the capital hike.
The offering will generate proceeds of up to 19.2 mln eur, net of expenses and commissions.
After the IPO, the free float will be of 28 pct if the IPO coordinator, Banca Caboto SpA, will fully exercise its 
greenshoe option.
SAT shares are due to start trading on July 26.

ROME (Thomson Financial) - Italian authorities are telling Ryanair Holdings PLC to transfer flights to Rome's 
Fiumicino airport, from its existing Ciampino base, said transport minister Alessandro Bianchi, estimating that 1 mln 
of its passengers a year will be affected.
Bianchi, Rome mayor Walter Veltroni, Lazio region president Piero Marrazzo, and air regulator ENAC president 
Enrico Gasbarra decided to cut daily flights out of Ciampino to 100, from 138, effective from the introduction of 
winter schedules, the transport ministry said.
In an interview with Thomson Financial, Bianchi said Ciampino's annual passengers has risen to 5 mln, from 
800,000, in the last five years, causing noise and other pollution problems for local residents.
Recognising the value of tourism brought to Rome by Ryanair, the minister said he is examining three 
neighbouring, mainly military, airports at Latina, Viterbo and Frosinone to see if one of these can be used by low-
cost airlines and a choice will be made in October.
Ryanair declined to comment, saying it had not been notified of the decision.
In the past, Ryanair has said that if had to close its operations at Ciampino it would leave Rome rather than use 
Fiumicino, which is Rome's larger airport and used by international carriers.
The three alternative options for a low-cost airport in Rome do not have suitable runways for its aircraft, it has said.
Since launching at Ciampino, Ryanair has built up annual passenger numbers to 3.3 mln.

COPENHAGEN (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings will not be operating discount routes from Denmark's 
Aalborg Airport after the airline and the airport failed to agree on charges, Danish daily NordJyske said on its 
website, citing airport director William Bluhme.
'We require a payment of 200 dkr a passenger, but Ryanair will only pay 20 dkr a passenger,' said Bluhme. 'As long 
as Ryanair wants positive differential treatment we cannot reach agreement with them.'
He said the airport, in the north of the Jutland peninsula, must cover its costs for handling passengers and 
baggage.
'All other airlines using Aalborg Airport pay 200 dkr a passenger, and Ryanair must do that as well,' he said.
Ryanair currently flies from Denmark using Aarhus, Billund and Esbjerg airports, all in Jutland.

PARIS Thomson Financial - France's highest court on Wednesday ruled that local labour laws applies to Ryanair 
and easyJet cabin staff based in France, the civil aviation authority DGAC said.
The Conseil d'Etat rejected a claim by both low-cost airlines that their cabin staff worked for company headquarters 
outside France and were therefore not subject to French law.
The court said the operating base of staff was located 'where employees work, where they begin their service and 
to where they return once their mission is accomplished'.
British airline easyJet said it had already started conforming to French labour law, but Irish carrier Ryanair said it 
would take the case to the European Court of Justice.

LUEBECK, Germany (Thomson Financial) - Luebeck city council said the sale of Blankensee airport in 2005 was in 
line with regulations on aid, after the EU said yesterday it had launched a probe into the sale and the airport's 
relationship with Ryanair Holdings PLC.
The EU said yesterday that airport operator Flughafen Luebeck GmbH signed a contract with Ryanair in 2000 which 
might constitute illegal and incompatible state aid, as it offers much more favourable charges than those set out in 
the regulations.
Luebeck's mayor, Bernd Saxe, said today that it can be assumed that the airport operator would only maintain 
business relations with Ryanir at market conditions.
The EU also said yesterday that the airport operator might have received operating aid by having its annual losses 
covered by the city council, and aid for infrastructure investment from Schleswig-Holstein federal state.
It said that the New Zealand company Infratil might have received state aid by being sold Flughafen Luebeck below 
the market price.

ATHENS (Thomson Financial) - Greece's minister of finance Giorgos Alogoskoufis said that the government has 
completed its sale of state assets for the year.
The statement comes on the heels of its successful 20 pct stake placement in the Greek Postal Savings Bank 
yesterday and the sale of its 10.7 pct stake in Hellenic Telecomms (OTE) last month. The two transactions rose 
over 1.6 bln euros for the state.
He said that the only lingering issue for the year is the government's divestment of its casino stakes, but he added 
that it no longer has time to deal with the matter.
Regarding Ryanair's statement yesterday that it plans to sue the European Commission for failure to act on 
complaints about airlines receiving state aid - citing Olympic Airlines as one example - the minister said that the 
government is in close cooperation with the European Commission to find a solution to the problem.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has said it will sue the European Commission (EC) in the 
European Courts for their apparent failure to take action on a number of state aid complaints involving Air France, 
Lufthansa, Alitalia and Olympic Airways, which were submitted to the Commission over a year ago.
The Irish low-cost carrier said the complaints involve hundreds of millions of Euros in illegal state aids being granted 
by the French, German, Italian and Greek governments to subsidise their flag carrier airlines.
Ryanair said it has repeatedly called on the Commission to investigate these claims, but said it failed to do so.
'On one hand they (the EC) refuse to take action against serious violations of the state aid rules by national 
governments to protect their flag carrier airlines like Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia and Olympic, while at the same 
time they launch bogus investigations against small regional and secondary airports like Charleroi. The foolishness 
of the Commission's Charleroi decision is that Ryanair now actually has a lower cost base in Charleroi,' Ryanair's 
head of regulatory affairs, Jim Callaghan, said in a statement.
Last February, Ryanair was ordered by the Commission to repay 4 mln eur of state aid given at Charleroi airport in 
Belgium.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission said it has launched formal state aid investigations 
into Germany's Schonefeld, Dortmund and Lubeck airport operators as well as Finland's Tampere Pirkkala airport 
operator.
The commission said Flughafen Schonefeld GmbH, which owns and operates Berlin Schonefeld airport, has 
concluded several bilateral contracts with airlines based at the airport since 2003, which might constitute illegal and 
incompatible state aid, as they offer these airlines lower airport charges than those proposed by published airport 
charge regulation.
The EU executive said Flughafen Schonefeld offers marketing support to these companies and has concluded an 
exclusive agreement with one airline. This consists of an exclusive use agreement for Terminal B of the airport and 
lower airport charges than the published charges.
In addition, the commission has opened an aid inquiry into Flughafen Dortmund GmbH, which operates Dortmund 
airport.
In 2004, the company put in place an incentive scheme called NERES (New and Existing Route Expansion 
Scheme) for airlines establishing new routes or extending existing routes to and from the airport.
The commission said the scheme may constitute illegal and incompatible state aid, as it offers airlines more 
favourable airport charges than those foreseen by the published airport charge regulation.
The EU executive has also opened an aid inquiry into Flughafen Lubeck GmbH, which operates Lubeck 
Blankensee airport.
The company concluded a bilateral contract with Ryanair in 2000 which might constitute illegal and incompatible 
state aid as it offers much more favourable airport charges than what is foreseen by the published airport charge 
regulation, the commission said.
According to the EU executive, Flughafen Lubeck might have received operating aid in the form of the take-over of 
annual losses by the city of Lubeck, as well as investment aid for infrastructure investment from the Land Schleswig 
Holstein.

It said that the New Zealand company Infratil, which acquired Flughafen Lubeck in 2005, might have received state 
aid in the form of a sales price under market price.
Finally, the commission has launched an inquiry into suspected state aid in air transport granted by the Finnish 
authorities.
The potential beneficiaries are two state-owned companies -- Finavia and Airpro -- as well as Irish air-carrier 
Ryanair when operating from Tampere Pirkkala Airport.

'wasting its time and resources' investigating Germany's Lubeck and Finland's Tampere Pirkkala airport operators.
'The Commission is wasting time and resources investigating the cost base of small secondary airports such as 
Lubeck and Tampere,' said a spokesman for Ryanair in the statement.
Earlier today, the European Commission said that it had launched formal state aid investigations into Germany's 
Schonefeld, Dortmund and Lubeck airport operators, as well as the other airports.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission said it is 'confident' the EU courts will back its 
decision-making after Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC announced it will sue the EU executive over an 
alleged failure to take action on airline state aid complaints.
A spokesman for the commission also said the commission had not yet been officially informed of the legal action.
The airline said the complaints, submitted to the commission over a year ago, involve hundreds of millions of euros 
in illegal state aids being granted by the French, German, Italian and Greek governments to subsidise respectively 
flag carriers Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia SpA and Olympic Airways.
Ryanair said it has repeatedly called on the commission to investigate these claims, but said it failed to do so.

FRANKFURT (Thomson Financial) - Deutsche Bank AG now holds a 12.5 pct stake in Air Berlin plc but it is unlikely 
the bank is holding the shares for a third party to prepare a takeover of Germany's second-largest airline, sources 
close to the financial institution told Thomson News partner dpa-AFX.
The majority of these shares are being held as pure asset management position by its investment bank unit DWS, 
the sources said.
That such a large position is being held by DWS downplays rumours that Deutsche Bank was holding the stock to 
help another company - perhaps Ryanair Holdings or Air France-KLM -- in a takeover offer, the sources added.
A Deutsche Bank spokesman said he could not comment on the takeover speculation or on the bank's increase in 
its Air Berlin shares.
On May 25, Air Berlin last reported that Deutsche Bank held a 10.08 pct stake in the airline.
An article in Spiegel magazine speculated that Deutsche Bank might be purchasing the shares for another 
company, and it mentioned RyanAir and Air France as possible interested parties.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Leading European exchanges remained higher midday with M&A talk in the 
spotlight in morning trade and upbeat drug development news boosting Bayer and Novartis.
At 13.02 am, the STOXX 50 was up 17.27 points at 3,996.74 and the STOXX 600 was up 1.58 points at 398.85.
Spread bettors, IG Index, said the Dow looks set to rise 20 points at the open ahead of US earnings season, with 
Alcoa due to kick off proceedings later.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 Index closed 121.04 points higher at 18,261.98 while the Hang Seng Index was 221.88 
points stronger at 22,753.17, having lagged last week's rally by global markets.
In Europe, M&A was in the spotlight again with Numico suspended ahead of an announcement.
Traders note talk the Dutch food producer group has received a 46.25 eur per share cash and paper offer.
'We're hearing Danone is in the frame,' said one Paris based dealer.
Shares in Numico have risen nearly 17 pct over the last week amid talk that it would be bought as Danone fights to 
fend off possible predators after it sold most of its biscuits and cereals business to Kraft last week.
But others doubt Danone is the bidder, pointing out Danone's shares are up and saying Danone would have to 
make a knock out bid of 50 eur per share or more to guarantee no-one else would make an offer.
Shares in MDAX-listed Depfa Bank stormed 3.08 pct amid vague talk Franco belgian group Dexia is preparing a bid 
for the group, with some traders noting talk of a 20.10 eur per share offer -- significantly higher than the current 
13.93 eur price.
Air Berlin added another 4.84 pct on persistent talk it will be bid for by either Ryanair or Air France-KLM.
Air France-KLM was also in focus as investors welcomed the airline's solid growth in traffic last month. Traders also 
noted renewed rumours that the group is interested in Alitalia.
And British Airways added 2.13 pct as Panmure Gordon lifted its recommendation to 'buy 'from 'hold'.
Euroshares higher midday on late Wall St rally, M&A talk
Over the weekend there were reports Iberia's board said it will not respond before September to a takeover 
approach by US private equity firm Texas Pacific Group and British Airways PLC, El Pais newspaper reported 
yesterday.
The news comes after a report in La Vanguardia, which said TPG has given the airline three weeks to reply to its 
3.4 bln eur takeover bid.
Elsewhere, shares in France Telecom were upgraded to 'neutral' from 'underperform' at Exane BNP Paribas after 
meetings with the telecom giant's management.
In a note landing this morning, the broker lifted its target price to 22 eur from 21 eur and said this offers 8 pct 
upside.
It said downside risk is now limited as prospects for the group's French mobile business look to be less downbeat 
than some had feared and as French landline business looks set to stabilise at current levels.
Shares climbed 1.18 pct higher.
Austrian peer Telekom Austria rose 4.21 pct after the company said it raised its long-term compound annual growth 
rate for EBITDA to 2.2 pct from 1.7 pct for 2007-10 thanks to better-than-expected developments in its international 
mobile business and effective cost reductions.
EBITDA for 2007 will be reduced by around 20 mln eur as a result of the EU-wide decrease in roaming charges, but 
will be offset through marketing and cost-saving measures, Telekom Austria said in a statement.
In the defence sector, shares in EADS were amongst the top gainers -- up 0.82 pct -- after International Herald 
Tribune reported the company's main private-sector shareholders have agreed in principle to a simpler 
management structure.
The chief executive will be named by DaimlerChrysler, and the chairman will be chosen by Lagardere SCA and the 
French state, the newspaper reported in its weekend edition.
Seperately, SG Secs lifted its target to 82 eur from 74 eur on DaimlerChryser -- up 1.36 pct -- and reiterated its 'buy' 
receommendation on the German car group.
Over in the steel sector, European stocks were given a boost by a bullish note from Deutsche Bank, which 
reiterated its overweight outlook on steel companies.
The broker upgraded shares in Arcelor Mittal -- up 2.27 pct -- to 'buy' from 'hold' and said it has increased its target 
price for Arcelor Mittal to 50 eur from 40 eur and also raised its valuation estimates for peers ThyssenKrupp, 
Salzgitter and SSAB.
Suez was 0.5 pct lower as investors continue to wait for news about its planned merger with Gaz de France -- up 
0.43 pct.
Les Echos said the French group would be willing to sell its Belgian gas division Distrigaz to French state-owned 
utility EDF as a way of pushing through the stalled merger.
Elsewhere, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in the Journal de Dimanche that he is continuing to look for the 
best possible solution to the delayed merger, adding that he expects to make an announcement 'shortly'.
Norsk Hydro fell 0.32 pct after it said it is to book 31 mln usd in write-downs and charges in the second quarter, 
after announcing it is to close or sell one of its US remelting plants in a bid to cut costs.
And shares in TUI were down 1.28 pct after Handelsblatt reported the tourism giant's airline unit, TUIfly, has missed 
internal targets since it was formed at the beginning of the year.
Euroshares higher midday on late Wall St rally, M&A talk
TUI's supervisory board will hold a meeting on Wednesday, earlier than planned, at which the board may discuss 
dismissing TUIfly head Christoph Mueller, the newspaper claimed.

FRANKFURT (Thomson Financial) - Shares in SDAX-listed Air Berlin Plc were higher in midday trade as rumours 
circulated that discount airline Ryanair Holdings might be interested in buying a stake in the German budget flyer.
Several Frankfurt-based traders said they had heard rumours about RyanAir buying an estimated 10.7 pct stake, 
which Deutsche Bank AG holds. One trader said he heard that Ryanair was interested it taking over Air Berlin.
Other industry sources doubted whether Irish-based airline was interested in buying the 10.7 pct stake.
'There is no truth is this rumour whatsoever,' said a broker in Ireland. 'I find it very hard to believe... it would be 
unlikely.' Air Berlin said it would not comment on the rumours.
At 12.45 pm, shares in Air Berlin were 0.60 eur or 3.73 pct higher at 16.70, while the SDAX was 6.74 eur or 0.10 pct 
higher at 6,632.57.

WARSAW (Thomson Financial) - Air travel in and out of Poland rose 33 pct in annual terms in the first quarter of 
this year, data from civil air authorities showed today.
In the first three months of 2007, airlines registered some 3.4 mln passengers, with budget airlines' market share 
rising to around 50 pct, the data showed.
Air travel to Poland has soared since it joined the EU in 2004, buoyed by the arrival of cheap carriers including 
Ryanair and Easy Jet.

FOCUS Ryanair 's EU appeal to kick-off as Aer Lingus ' future hangs in balance
FOCUS Ryanair's EU appeal to kick-off as Aer Lingus' future hangs in 
balance

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLCs campaign to appeal a European Union 
ruling, which blocked the airline's 1 bln stg takeover bid for rival Aer Lingus Group PLC is set to kick-off in earnest 
this week.
Ryanair's outspoken chief executive Michael O'Leary said the ruling was a 'nakedly political decision' to support the 
Dublin government which is against an Aer Lingus takeover and still retains a 25.3 pct stake in the privatised airline. 
As such, he has promised to lodge an appeal to the Europe's second-highest court, the Court of First Instance, 
within two months -- the deadline to make such a legal challenge.
Brussels' Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes last week said the combination of the two Dublin-based airlines 
would have created a near-monopoly in the Irish market, which would have been bad for the consumer. She added 
the deal would have reduced choice and probably have led to higher prices for more than 14 mln passengers in the 
EU using routes to and from Ireland each year.
'The takeover would have merged the two main airlines in Ireland and would have given Ryanair a monopoly on 22 
routes to and from Ireland. On the remaining 13 Irish routes on which the two compete, the Commission found that 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus were each other's closest competitors so that a merger of the two would have significantly 
reduced competition,' said Catriona Hatton, Partner at International law firm Hogan & Hartson.
Ryanair's appeal may hinge on the argument that this is the first time the Commission has prohibited a merger 
between two companies which combined will have less than 5 pct of the EU market. It is only the 20th time the 
commission has blocked a merger out of 3000 cases since 1990. It is also the first time in that period the EU has 
vetoed a combination in the EU aviation industry.
O'Leary also claims the Commission was wrong to block its takeover when it had cleared others similar deals.
'This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited an airline merger and reverses a 20 year policy of 
encouraging EU airline mergers, having previously approved the larger Air France/KLM merger and the 
Lufthansa/Austrian/Swiss mergers,' O'Leary said.
However, the Commission is thought to be on relatively safe ground, having revised its procedures after a series of 
reverses in the Court of First Instance, in 2002.
FOCUS Ryanair 's EU appeal to kick-off as Aer Lingus ' future hangs in balance
Ryanair said the merger would have offered consumers fare reductions of around 100 mln eur per annum. It also 
claimed the prohibition would leave Aer Lingus, which lost 70 mln eur last year, exposed as a peripheral loss 
making regional airline, unable to compete with Ryanair.
Aer Lingus hit back and said it had raised 400 mln eur from its recent IPO, which is facilitating the expansion and 
replacement of short haul and long haul aircraft and the on-going development of new routes. The carrier said it had 
made 'significant progress' over the past nine months and would be able to compete with Ryanair and offer more 
choice to consumers.
'Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, 
despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers,' said John Sharman, Aer Lingus' 
chairman. 'Aer Lingus already competes successfully with Ryanair across many routes and will continue to do so in 
the interests of all consumers.'
To try to win approval for its bid, Ryanair offered to sell up to two-thirds of Aer Lingus' slots at Heathrow, and 
offered the disposal of slots at other European airports, still leaving the airline with about 80 pct of the market at 
Dublin's airport.
The EU executive said Ryanair's proposed remedies offered during the investigation were 'inadequate' and 
'insufficient' to alleviate competition concerns. The 'limited number' of airport slots offered were not likely to lead to 
competition sufficient to replace the competitive pressure currently exercised by each airline on the other, said the 
Commission.
'Ryanair did offer to give up slots at Dublin in an attempt to address the competition concerns identified by the 
Commission. However, the Commission considered that the limited number of slots offered was unlikely to 
encourage new entrants to the extent needed to replace the competitive pressure which Aer Lingus currently exerts 
on Ryanair,' said Hogan & Hartsons Hatton.
As part of the merger, Ryanair said it would remove Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges and offered to lower the short-haul 
fares of Aer Lingus by 10 pct for one year.
Many analysts believe that even without the commission's intervention, Ryanair would have struggled to complete 
the takeover anyway. The airline has only managed to amass a 25 pct stake in Aer Lingus since it proposed the 
merger.
Some had expected the commission to try to force Ryanair to sell its stake but Kroes said the regulator was 'not in a 
position to require Ryanair to divest its minority share.' She also said that she was open to considering a revised 
offer from Ryanair, arguing that hers was not 'a never-ever decision.'
At 11.55 am today shares in Ryanair were up 0.03 euro cents or 0.61 pct at 4.97 euros, while stock in Aer Lingus 
had fallen by 0.04 cents or 1.49 pct to 2.65 euros.

Ryanair plans to reopen Clermont Ferrand -London route

CLERMONT-FERRAND, France (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings aims to reopen a route between the town 
of Clermont Ferrand in France and London, said Rene Souchon, president of the Auvergne regional council.
'Negotiations are going on with a view to Ryanair being able to reopen a thrice-weekly flight between Clermont and 
London from April 1 2008', Souchon said.
'We have a draft agreement, but there are still many things to negotiate', Souchon said, adding Ryanair did not give 
a timetable as it wanted to 'test the number of potential customers'. The route would operate between April and 
October.
Ryanair had a daily route between Clermont Ferrand and London Stansted between May 2003 and Jan 2004, 
which was used by 45,000 passengers. The route was opened as Ryanair received construction and commercial 
aid to do so when former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing was president of the regional council.
'At the time, the aid was not supervised as it is today. I am not going to give a blank cheque to Ryanair,' Souchon 
said.
He said the reopening of the route would increase passenger traffic at the Auvergne airport, which had dropped to 
552,000 in 2006 from 1.1 mln passengers in 2002 and would attract British tourists to the region.
Ryanair, which left Saint-Etienne in June 2006 for Grenoble, is present in Limoges and Rodez. 'There is a big gap 
between Limoges-Rodez and Grenoble; that gives it a not-inconsiderable potential,' said the Auvergne council 
president.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said the European Commission 
does not rule out a future merger between Ryanair Holdings PLC and Aer Lingus Group PLC under the right 
conditions, on the day a combination of the two airlines was blocked by the EU executive.
Speaking to reporters, Kroes said the tie-up is not a case of 'never ever' and the deal 'can be fixed' under the 'right 
conditions'.
The commission reminded it can only rule on the content of merger notifications that are submitted to it.
Separately, following the negative ruling, Kroes confirmed that the commission does not have powers to force 
Ryanair to sell part or all of its 25.2 pct minority shareholding in Aer Lingus as it does not constitute a controlling 
interest.
'The Commission is not in a position to require Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding,' she said.
Kroes also said claims by Ryanair that the commission leaked confidential information regarding the process and 
decision-making of the file are 'nonsense'.
The Irish low cost carrier confirmed yesterday that it has filed a formal complaint over the matter to the EU 
ombudsman.
Earlier, the EU executive blocked Ryanair's proposed 1.48 bln eur hostile acquisition of domestic flag carrier Aer 
Lingus, saying the tie-up would be anti-competitive and harm consumers by creating a monopoly on 22 routes and 
a dominant position with a market share over 60 pct on a further 13.
It added the deal would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 mln passengers 
in the EU using these routes to and from Ireland each year.
The commission confirmed that Ryanair's proposed remedies offered during the investigation were 'inadequate' and 
'insufficient' to alleviate competition concerns.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission has blocked Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC's proposed 1.48 bln eur hostile acquisition of domestic flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
It said the combination would be anti-competitive and harm consumers by creating a monopoly on 22 routes and a 
dominant position with a market share over 60 pct on a further 13.
It added the deal would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 mln passengers 
in the EU using these routes to and from Ireland each year.
The EU executive also confirmed that Ryanair's proposed remedies offered during the investigation were 
'inadequate' and 'insufficient' to alleviate competition concerns.
The 'limited number' of airport slots offered were 'not likely to lead to competition sufficient to replace the 
competitive pressure currently exercised by each airline on the other', it continued.
The commission said both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are currently by far the largest airlines offering short-haul flights 
to and from Ireland and constitute the main competitive constraints on each other on these routes.
It says their position is particularly strong to and from Dublin, where the merged entity would have accounted for 
around 80 pct of all intra-European traffic.
It's investigation also revealed that most airlines were unlikely to enter into direct competition against a merged 
Ryanair/Aer Lingus in Ireland.
'This is not only because the merged entity would be able to operate from the very large bases of Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus in Ireland ... but also because Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by 
competitors,' it reasoned.
'A merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus would have had even greater flexibility to engage in selective short-term price 
reductions and capacity increases if competitors entered routes to and from Ireland, in order to protect its powerful 
market position,' it added.
'The likelihood of entry is further reduced by peak-time congestion at Dublin airport and other airports on overlap 
routes.'
Ryanair buy of Aer Lingus blocked by EU
The commission said this case differs from previous airline mergers it had cleared, because it is the first time it has 
assessed a tie-up of the two main airlines in a single country with both operating from the same 'home' airport, in 
this case Dublin.
It is also the first time the commission has assessed a merger of two 'low-cost' airlines, operating on a 'point-to-
point' basis, it said, adding the number of overlapping routes is 'unprecedented'.
EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard 
Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport, and other EU consumers.'
'Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices. Low-
cost carriers like Ryanair are no exception to this rule'.
It is only the 20th time the commission has blocked a merger out of 3,000 cases since 1990. It is also the first time 
in that period the EU has vetoed a combination in the EU aviation industry.
Yesterday, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expected the veto and launched a blistering attack 
against EU regulators over their analysis of the deal and what he termed 'persistent and repeated' leaks by the 
commission of confidential information regarding the process and decision-making of the file.
The group has filed a formal complaint to the EU ombudsman over the alleged leaks.
He also claimed the decision is 'nakedly political', with the commission intent on 'facilitating the interests of the Irish 
government'.
The EU executive denied all charges made against it.
On the analysis, O'Leary said the two Irish airlines' combined share of route activity from Dublin is equivalent to 
other merged airlines' shares of their own European regional airports.
He also said the proposed takeover would affect less than 5 pct of the European airline market and would result in 
200 mln eur cost savings, as well as 100 mln eur in savings for customers from lower fares and and the scrapping 
of fuel surcharges.
O'Leary said he has a 'high degree of confidence' that the EU's second-highest court, the European Court of 
Instance, will overturn the block, following an appeal lodged within two months of the EU executive's ruling.
Ryanair withdrew its 2.80 eur per share takeover bid at the end of December last year after the commission 
launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns'. It built up a 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus before 
launching its bid.
The deal has faced opposition from the start. Aer Lingus and its largest shareholder, the Irish government, fiercely 
opposed the deal. Unions have also expressed concern.
Ryanair operates low-cost services on more than 400 routes across Europe and carried more than 40 mln 
passengers last year.
Aer Lingus is an Irish flag carrier which has changed its business model in recent years to offer mainly low-cost 
short-haul flights. It operates more than 80 routes and carried more than 8.6 mln passengers last year.
Its operations are limited to routes to and from Ireland, operating from Dublin, Shannon and Cork.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission has blocked Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC's proposed 1.48 bln eur hostile acquisition of domestic flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
It said the combination would be anti-competitive and harm consumers by creating a monopoly on 22 routes and a 
dominant position with a market share over 60 pct on a further 13.
It added the deal would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 mln passengers 
in the EU using these routes to and from Ireland each year.
The EU executive also confirmed that Ryanair's proposed remedies offered during the investigation were 
'inadequate' and 'insufficient' to alleviate competition concerns.
The 'limited number' of airport slots offered were 'not likely to lead to competition sufficient to replace the 
competitive pressure currently exercised by each airline on the other', it continued.
The commission said both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are currently by far the largest airlines offering short-haul flights 
to and from Ireland and constitute the main competitive constraints on each other on these routes.
It says their position is particularly strong to and from Dublin, where the merged entity would have accounted for 
around 80 pct of all intra-European traffic.
It's investigation also revealed that most airlines were unlikely to enter into direct competition against a merged 
Ryanair/Aer Lingus in Ireland.
'This is not only because the merged entity would be able to operate from the very large bases of Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus in Ireland ... but also because Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by 
competitors,' it reasoned.
'A merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus would have had even greater flexibility to engage in selective short-term price 
reductions and capacity increases if competitors entered routes to and from Ireland, in order to protect its powerful 
market position,' it added.
'The likelihood of entry is further reduced by peak-time congestion at Dublin airport and other airports on overlap 
routes.'
Ryanair buy of Aer Lingus blocked by EU
The commission said this case differs from previous airline mergers it had cleared, because it is the first time it has 
assessed a tie-up of the two main airlines in a single country with both operating from the same 'home' airport, in 
this case Dublin.
It is also the first time the commission has assessed a merger of two 'low-cost' airlines, operating on a 'point-to-
point' basis, it said, adding the number of overlapping routes is 'unprecedented'.
EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard 
Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport, and other EU consumers.'
'Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices. Low-
cost carriers like Ryanair are no exception to this rule'.
It is only the 20th time the commission has blocked a merger out of 3,000 cases since 1990. It is also the first time 
in that period the EU has vetoed a combination in the EU aviation industry.
Yesterday, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expected the veto and launched a blistering attack 
against EU regulators over their analysis of the deal and what he termed 'persistent and repeated' leaks by the 
commission of confidential information regarding the process and decision-making of the file.
The group has filed a formal complaint to the EU ombudsman over the alleged leaks.
He also claimed the decision is 'nakedly political', with the commission intent on 'facilitating the interests of the Irish 
government'.
The EU executive denied all charges made against it.
On the analysis, O'Leary said the two Irish airlines' combined share of route activity from Dublin is equivalent to 
other merged airlines' shares of their own European regional airports.
He also said the proposed takeover would affect less than 5 pct of the European airline market and would result in 
200 mln eur cost savings, as well as 100 mln eur in savings for customers from lower fares and and the scrapping 
of fuel surcharges.
O'Leary said he has a 'high degree of confidence' that the EU's second-highest court, the European Court of 
Instance, will overturn the block, following an appeal lodged within two months of the EU executive's ruling.

inquiries last one month, but are extended by two weeks when companies offer remedies or when a national 
competition authority asks to rule on the deal. A deal that is not expected to raise competition concerns 
may be submitted as a candidate for the EU's simplified merger procedure, a reduced regulatory process. 
The commission is entitled to transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.

during the first-phase inquiry.

July 27 -Proposed acquisition by Nestle SA of Novartis AG's Gerber unit
The Commission launches first-phase inquiries into all deals that meet EU merger thresholds. These 
inquiries last one month, but are extended by two weeks when companies offer remedies or when a national 
competition authority asks to rule on the deal. A deal that is not expected to raise competition concerns 
may be submitted as a candidate for the EU's simplified merger procedure, a reduced regulatory process. 
The commission is entitled to transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.
IN-DEPTH SECOND-PHASE INVESTIGATIONS
August 2 -Proposed acquisition by SFR France of Tele2 France's fixed telephone and internet access 
activities
September 13 -Proposed acquisition by Travelport Ltd of travel reservations systems operator Worldspan LP
October 10 -Proposed merger between Sony Corp and Bertelsmann AG's recorded music divisions
October 19 -Proposed acquisition by Kronospan of Constantia Industries A's raw and coated particle board 
business.
The Commission opens in-depth probes lasting up to four months if competition concerns cannot be resolved 
during the first-phase inquiry.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary is preparing today to 
respond to information that the European Commission will block the Irish low-cost air carrier's proposed 1.48 bln 
hostile acquisition of flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC tomorrow.
Ryanair said O'Leary will meet reporters here to 'discuss Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus and the European 
Commission's leaked decision to block it'.
Representatives of Ryanair declined to elaborate further on this claim.
Sources told Thomson Financial News on June 14 that the commission is ready to veto the deal. The commission 
was unavailable for comment.
The sources said that while Ryanair has offered remedies to alleviate the commission's antitrust concerns, the 
moves have not been sufficient. In particular, new remedies offered during the EU executive's in-depth second 
phase inquiry have not been seen as credible.
One of the sources said Aer Lingus' opposition to the deal would have created difficulties for the tie-up from the 
start.
The commission was set to rule on the deal by July 4, but a negative ruling could come tomorrow, with the 
commissioners holding their weekly meeting.
The deadline was extended several times as commitments, specifically on slots at Dublin Airport and London's 
Heathrow Airport, have been offered.
Ryanair's finance director, Howard Miller told TFN on June 5 that the group expects a 'politically motivated' negative 
decision and that the carrier would likely challenge the commission's review of Ryanair's proposed offer in the 
courts.
'The Irish government is not in favour of it (the proposed merger) and the EC competition authorities generally do 
what the governments want to do,' Miller said.
OUTLOOK Ryanair CEO O'Leary readies response as EU set to veto Aer Lingus bid
'It has approved other similar deals but when it comes to two carriers operating with less than 5 pct of the market 
share, they decide they're not going to approve it, so you can only assume it's a politically motivated decision.'
His comments echoed those of CEO O'Leary on May 9: 'The EU will rule in the interests of the Irish government 
rather than the consumer,' he said. 'We hope they will approve (the deal) but we suspect they won't, in which case 
we will immediately appeal to the European Court.'
A verdict against Ryanair's lapsed bid would be 'purely political', in light of the approval of Air France's tie-up with 
KLM and Flybe's recent takeover of BA Connect, O'Leary said at a press conference in London.
Ryanair withdrew its 2.80 eur per share takeover bid at the end of December last year after the commission 
launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest 
airlines.
Ryanair did not withdraw the notification of the deal to regulatory authorities, though, and has said it would consider 
making another offer if the European Commission approved the proposed takeover.
The commission noted its concern over combining Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer 
choice and lead to higher fares.
At the time, EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'My main priority on this case is to make sure that 
consumers would continue to enjoy a competitive choice of airline services.'
Ryanair built up a 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid.
The deal has faced opposition from the start. Aer Lingus and its largest shareholder, the Irish government, fiercely 
opposed the deal. Unions have also expressed concern.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - Aer Lingus Group PLC's chief executive Dermot Mannion said that Ryanair 
Holdings PLC's Michael O'Leary is 'lashing out' in an attempt to disguise his failure to take out the company's 
closest competitor.
'Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor and he has failed. He is now lashing out in a vain 
attempt to disguise that failure,' Mannion said in a statement.
O'Leary launched a stinging attack on the European Commission this morning and confirmed the group has filed a 
formal complaint with the EU ombudsman over 'persistent and repeated' leaks by the commission of confidential 
information regarding the process and decision-making of the file.
He told reporters here that the expected veto would be 'unjustified' and a 'nakedly political' decision.
Mannion said if the commission announces a prohibition decision following its investigation, 'it will represent another 
boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers'.
'We have made tremendous strides over a relatively short time in successfully executing our strategy and look 
forward to making even more progress in the coming months. The environment is competitive and we will continue 
to fight to deliver on our excellent prospects as an independent company,' he said.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission said it 'refutes completely' Ryanair Holdings PLC's 
chief executive Michael O'Leary's claim it would make a 'nakedly political' decision on its bid for Aer Lingus PLC.
'I can refute that (claim) completely,' EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said.
'The commission is under an obligation to be completely impartial and objective,' he added.
'It is very easy to criticise a decision which has not yet been taken,' he said, noting the deadline for the inquiry is 
July 4.
'A decision will be taken at the latest by July 4, until such time I cannot make any comment of prejudge the 
commission's decision,' Todd said.
O'Leary said this morning the expected veto would be 'unjustified' and a 'nakedly political' decision.
In response to O'Leary's claims that the EU leaked information regarding the process and decision-making of the 
file, Todd said the commission had not leaked any information about any ongoing merger investigation.
'Trying to get merger information out of the commission is as easy as trying to get blood out of a stone,' he told 
reporters here.
'If anyone here has ever obtained information from the commission regarding an ongoing merger inquiry I would 
invite you to raise your hand now... I cannot see any hands raised,' he said.
Todd said the reason why the deal was being scrutinised was due to the fact that both airlines operate out of the 
same home base airport -- Dublin, Ireland.
He said the potential market overlap would be higher in this case, compared to other cases involving airlines which 
operate out of different home bases.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary launched a blistering 
attack against European Commission regulators and said he expects the EU executive to veto the Irish low-cost air 
carrier's proposed 1.48 bln eur hostile acquisition of flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
The commission is expected to block the merger tomorrow when the commissioners join up for their weekly 
meeting. If not then, it will issue its decision by early next week at the latest.
If it does issue a veto, it will be only the 20th time the commission has blocked a merger out of 3,000 cases since 
1990. It will also be the first time in that period the EU has vetoed a combination in the EU aviation industry.
Sources said Ryanair has offered remedies that have not been sufficient to alleviate antitrust concerns. A current 
deadline for the ruling of July 4 was extended several times as commitments were offered, specifically on slots at 
Dublin Airport, where the combination would result in a dominant carrier, and London's Heathrow Airport.
O'Leary noted the commission had approved other mergers in the EU aviation industry, notably Air France-KLM 
and Lufthansa/Swiss, which he claimed offered less competitive commitments, and said, in view of the 
'unprecedented remedies package' proposed by the Irish carrier in this case, the commission is showing a 'lack of 
impartiality'.
He also claimed the commission's analysis of the competitive effects of the merger on Dublin Airport and the whole 
EU airline industry were flawed and added that, contrary to commission fears, rival airlines would also operate from 
the airport.
He said the two Irish airlines' combined share of route activity from Dublin of 61 pct -- lowered to about 50 pct in 
light of commitments -- is equivalent to other merged airlines' shares of their own European regional airports.
He also said the proposed takeover would affect less than 5 pct of the European airline market and would result in 
200 mln eur cost savings, as well as 100 mln eur in savings for customers from lower fares and and the scrapping 
of fuel surcharges.
'The commission will argue that black is white and white is black,' he said, referring to the expected negative ruling. 
'Everything to do with this decision is crazy'.
ROUNDUP Ryanair 's O'Leary on offensive as EU readies to block Aer Lingus merger
O'Leary thinks it will be 'impossible' for the commission to force the carrier to sell its 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus as 
it is not a controlling interest.
He also told reporters here that the expected veto would be 'unjustified' and a 'nakedly political' decision.
He reasoned that other airline mergers were supported by national governments and therefore, by extension, by the 
commission. The Irish government's opposition to Ryanair/Aer Lingus, he reasoned, was the difference that could 
lead to a veto.
The commission, he said, is intent on 'facilitating the interests of the Irish government'.
In response, the EU executive refuted 'completely' any political bias.
Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion said O'Leary was 'lashing out' in an attempt to disguise his failure to 
take out the company's closest competitor.
'Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor and he has failed. He is now lashing out in a vain 
attempt to disguise that failure,' Mannion said in a statement.
Separately, O'Leary confirmed the group has filed a formal complaint with the EU ombudsman over 'persistent and 
repeated' leaks by the commission of confidential information regarding the process and decision-making of the file.
In response, the commission told Thomson Financial News it 'has not leaked information about any ongoing merger 
investigation'.
A source said there were several member states or interested parties who would have a vested interest in leaking 
such information.
O'Leary said he has a 'high degree of confidence' that the EU's second-highest court, the European Court of 
Instance, will overturn the block, following an appeal lodged within two months of the EU executive's ruling.
He said it would be difficult for Ryanair to look at other merger possibilities while the court case is pending and 
reiterated that the carrier would look at revisiting a bid for Aer Lingus following the court's decision.
Ryanair withdrew its 2.80 eur per share takeover bid at the end of December last year after the commission 
launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest

Holdings PLC that the airline market is heading for a serious downturn, the Guardian reported, citing the CEO.
Economic indicators across Europe pointed to continued growth for low-cost carriers despite a recent softening in 
demand for air travel, Harrison told the Guardian.
Last week, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary reiterated forecasts made on June 5 of a 5 pct downturn in 
yields and a 6-7 pct rise in unit costs this year.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary said the Irish low-cost air 
carrier expects the European Commission in the coming week to block its proposed 1.48 bln hostile acquisition of 
flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
O'Leary also confirmed the group has filed a formal complaint with the EU ombudsman over 'persistent and 
repeated' leaks by the commission of confidential information regarding the process and decision-making of the file.
He added the expected veto would be 'unjustified' and a 'nakedly political' decision.

MADRID (Thomson Financial) - Tour operator Marsans' bid for Spanair is underway as planned and should be 
formally launched in two-four months, once the valuation process is complete, chairman of Spanair and owner of 
Marsans Gonzalo Pascual said.
Speaking to reporters after an awards ceremony, Pascual commented on recent speculation of other bids for 
Spanair, noting that no official interest has yet to be announced.
'We must distinguish between those participating and those who are just curious,' he said, while reiterating that 
there is still time for another bidder to appear.
Pascual declined to disclose any financial details of the planned bid for Spanair.
Spanair is fully owned by SAS AB, which announced last week it is putting Spanair up for sale as part of an 
international sell-off of non-core assets.
As to concerns sparked by Ryanair chairman Michael O'Leary's comments earlier this week, giving a grim sector 
outlook for low-cost airlines, Pascual dismissed the 'doom and gloom' forecasts.
'Globally speaking, that may be true in some part,' he said. 'But in Spain I still see room for growth among carriers.'

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has called on Ireland's aviation regulator to 
block Dublin Airport Authority's plan to build a 850 mln eur second terminal at Dublin Airport.
Ryanair said it had filed comments on the Commission for Aviation Regulation's draft review of Dublin Airport 
charges today, saying the terminal is 'the wrong size, in the wrong location, and is the wrong cost'.
'Ryanair's passengers should not be forced to pay higher charges for a terminal they will never use,' the airline said.
The CAR published its draft review on 21 May, in which it said charges would not need to increase until the new 
terminal opens in 2009. A four-week public consultation period followed the publication.
Last September, Ryanair wrote to the DAA offering to build a low-cost terminal at Dublin Airport for 250 mln eur.

MADRID (Thomson Financial) - Share prices were higher in quiet midday trade, led by gains in Telefonica after a 
UBS upgrade and Repsol YPF on M&A hopes, while Altadis underperformed as expectations of a formal bid from 
CVC this week faded.
At 11.55 am, the IBEX-35 index was up 46.5 points at 15,046.7, after trading in a range of 15,023-15,088.
Equities opened higher, after Wall Street's late recovery overnight, but pared gains over the morning as the 
rebound ran out of steam.
'The bond markets have gone down a bit, so investors are feeling more comfortable, but volumes are light, and 
there's no US data today to provide fresh impetus,' a Madrid-based trader said.
Telefonica was up 0.11 eur at 16.45, after UBS upgraded its shares to 'neutral' from 'reduce' and raised its target 
price to 16.70 eur from 15.70 eur, forecasting sustained earnings momentum.
Repsol YPF gained 0.29 to 28.89, after a report in Argentina's Ambito Financiero that the company is about to close 
the sale of YPF to businessman Enrique Eskenazi for 3 bln usd.
'Hopes for further M&A action following the sale of YPF continue to boost the stock, players continuing to bet on a 
deal with Gas Natural,' the trader said.
Gas Natural was up 0.10 at 44.15.
Iberia advanced 0.04 to 3.78, after a Wall Street Journal report that Lufthansa has discussed a possible bid for the 
flag carrier together with APAX warmed up M&A speculation.
Low-cost carrier Vueling plummeted 1.88 or 6.94 pct to 25.22, extending yesterday's 9 pct decline after negative 
comments on the outlook for the no frills air sector by Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Altadis, meanwhile, shed 0.15 to 50.05, after sources close to the operation told Thomson Financial News 
yesterday a bid for the tobacco company by the CVC Capital Partners-led consortium is not imminent, taking some 
heat out of the stock.
Madrid shares higher midday led by Telefonica , Repsol; Altadis underperforms
Stocks with renewable interests were firm, with Gamesa up 0.51 at 27.90 and Acciona 1.65 higher at 205.05, 
boosted by positive sector sentiment following Solaria's upbeat market debut yesterday.
Solaria climbed 0.53 or 4.45 pct to 12.43, extending yesterday's 25 pct gain.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Shares in Ryanair fell in early afternoon deals after the budget airline extended its 
10 stg seat sale into the summer peak months in response to continuing softness in the market and as cautious 
comments unsettled investors.
At 13.12, Ryanair shares were down 0.17 eur, or 3.29 pct, at 5 eur in Dublin trade. They had been as low as 4.885 
eur but came off lows as traders said the sell-off was an over-reaction.
'He's not saying anything he didn't say at the beginning of the month,' said one dealer, referring to CEO Michael 
O'Leary's comments at a press conference in London today.
Another trader agreed.
'There's nothing new in what they said. They're reaffirming what they said on June 5th.'
'The market has over-reacted.'
'Loads are strong but yields are lower,' O'Leary told a news conference in London. 'It's good for passengers but bad 
for profits.'
Earlier this month, Ryanair warned of a sharp slowdown in growth over the coming year.
In a statement accompanying its full year results, the airline said it expects yields to fall by up to 5 pct, with unit 
costs seen rising by 6-7 pct due in part to longer journey lengths and higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin 
but partly offset by lower fuel costs secured through hedging.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair has announced it is extending its 10 stg seat sale into the summer peak 
months of July, August and September in response to continuing softness in the market.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the sale of 3 mln seats for 10 stg including charges and taxes, which will cost 
the company between 25 and 45 mln stg, would stimulate late bookings and increase the airline's yields.
'Bookings are going very strongly, loads are strong but yields are lower,' he said at a news conference in London. 
'It's good for passengers but bad for profits.'
He said the market softening is confined to the UK, and he put the blame on a doubling of BAA's charges at 
Stansted to 12 stg per passenger, the 5 stg increase in Air Passenger Duty, higher interest rates and good weather.
If the market continues to be soft into the winter, he said the airline would move some of its aircraft from Stansted to 
its mainland European bases.
O'Leary also said the company expects the European Commission to block its takeover of Aer Lingus in the next 
two weeks, and he reiterated that if that is the case, Ryanair will appeal.
'We will be appealing to the European courts what is clearly a political decision taken by the EU to appease the Irish 
government,' he said.

two weeks, and he reiterated that if that is the case, Ryanair will appeal.
'We will be appealing to the European courts what is clearly a political decision taken by the EU to appease the Irish 
government,' he said.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission is expected to block Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC's proposed 1.48 bln hostile acquisition of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC, sources told 
Thomson Financial News.
Sources said while Ryanair has offered remedies to alleviate the commission's antitrust concerns, the moves have 
not been sufficient. In particular, new remedies offered during the EU executive's in-depth second phase inquiry 
have not been seen as credible.
One of the sources said Aer Lingus' opposition to the deal would have created difficulties for the tie-up from the 
start.
The commission is set to rule on the deal by July 4, but a negative ruling could come before that -- barring a last-
minute intervention. The deadline was extended several times as commitments, specifically on slots, have been 
offered.
Ryanair's finance director, Howard Miller told Thomson Financial News on June 5 that the group expects a 
'politically motivated' negative decision and that the carrier would likely challenge the commission's review of 
Ryanair's proposed offer in the courts.
'The Irish government is not in favour of it [the proposed merger] and the EC competition authorities generally do 
what the governments want to do,' Miller said.
'It has approved other similar deals but when it comes to two carriers operating with less than 5 pct of the market 
share they decide they're not going to approve it so you can only assume it's a politically motivated decision.'
His comments echoed those of Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on May 9.
'The EU will rule in the interests of the Irish government rather than the consumer,' he said. 'We hope they will 
approve (the deal) but we suspect they won't, in which case we will immediately appeal to the European Court.'
A verdict against Ryanair's lapsed bid would be 'purely political', in light of the approval of Air France's tie-up with 
KLM and Flybe's recent takeover of BA Connect, O'Leary said at a press conference in London.
EU expected to block Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus - sources
Ryanair withdrew its 2.80 eur per share takeover bid at the end of December last year after the commission 
launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest 
airlines.
The commission noted its concern over combining Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer 
choice and lead to higher fares.
At the time, EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'My main priority on this case is to make sure that 
consumers would continue to enjoy a competitive choice of airline services.'
Ryanair built up a 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid.
The deal has faced opposition from the start. Aer Lingus and its largest shareholder, the Irish government, fiercely 
opposed the deal. Unions have also expressed concern.

NEW YORK (AP) - Video game publisher Activision Inc.'s stock rose in midday trading helping to send the Nasdaq 
100 higher on Thursday.
Market research company NPD Group is scheduled to release May U.S. video game and console sales data after 
the market closes Thursday. Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson wrote in a research note that he expects 
Activision's sales to more than double to $71 million on sales of 'Spider-Man 3,' 'Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam' and 
'Shrek the Third.'
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 
9.62 points to 1,923.49. The broader Nasdaq composite gained 16.24 points to 2,598.55.
Activision rose 65 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $19.20.
Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. rose $1.47, or 3.6 percent, to $42.73. Friedman, Billings, Ramsey analyst Jim 
Reddoch said Amylin is poised to gain from a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel's rejection of Sanofi-
Aventis SA's weight-loss drug Rimonabant on safety concerns.
'Investors can now buy Amylin with the confidence that (its) Byetta remains the only new drug that causes weight 
loss in Type II diabetes patients,' analyst Jim Reddoch wrote in a note to clients.
Akami Technologies Inc., which provides technology for online content streaming, rose $1.30, or 2.8 percent, to 
$48.26.
Losers included Autodesk Inc., which makes computer-aided design software for architects and engineers, declined 
$2.20, or 4.7 percent, to $44.85. Goldman Sachs on Thursday removed the company from its 'America's Buy List' 
noting that the stock was trading just under its 12-month price target and that it doesn't anticipate a significant near-
term catalyst that would send the shares up.
Symantec Corp. declined 53 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $19.48. Earlier Thursday, the security software company 
authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase plan.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, declined 68 cents to $37.80.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission is almost certain to block Ryanair Holdings' bid for Aer 
Lingus Group PLC later this month, according to a report.
Brussels has found that a combination of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would undermine competition and harm 
consumers, the Financial Times said.
The commission has until July 4 to finalise its decision, but it has drafted and circulated a ruling to national 
competition regulators prohibiting the deal, the newspaper cited 'several people familiar with the case' as saying. 
The regulators have backed the commission's findings and Brussels is expected to announce its decision on June 
27, the FT said.

STOCKWATCH Air France - KLM rises on CEO M&A comments after last week's tumble
STOCKWATCH Air France-KLM rises on CEO M&A comments after last

PARIS (Thomson Financial) - Air France-KLM rose sharply in morning trading as investors reacted to comments 
from the airline's chief executive indicating it could make acquisitions 'soon', although dealers cautioned that the 
gains were more to do with heavy profit-taking last week following the stock's recent record highs.
At 11.34 am, Air France-KLM was up eur 0.92 or 2.65 pct at 35.70 -- after reaching 36.03 in earlier deals -- while 
the CAC-40 was 47.33 points or 0.80 pct higher at 5,930.62.
In an interview with German weekly Wirtschafts Woche published over the weekend, Jean-Cyril Spinetta said said 
he expects further further consolidation in the airline industry in the near future and that his company 'could be 
active in that area soon'.
He underlined that Air France-KLM has the necessary funds to carry out acquisitions, saying that costs will be 
lowered by 1.4 bln eur under the Challenge 10 savings programme while further synergies will boost income 'by at 
least 1.9 bln eur by 2011'.
But an Air France-KLM spokeswoman cautioned that the interview dated from the company's annual results last 
month, so merely repeats its previously stated position.
She declined to comment on what takeover targets Air France-KLM is considering.
Speculation in the airline sector has focused on possible bidders for Iberia. Air France-KLM has said his group is 
not in direct talks with the Spanish carrier and has also denied being in contact with investment fund Apax Partners 
over a possible bid for Iberia.
A Paris dealer agreed that the Spinetta interview was not that significant, attributing the morning's gains more to the 
fact Air France-KLM had 'dropped very very hard' last week, losing around 10 pct.
He said the airline had suffered from profit-taking because it was at historic highs, was affected by Ryanair's 
warning of lower profit growth this year, as well as a report from Ernst & Young pointing to the impact of carbon 
dioxide regulations on airlines.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Shares in Ryanair have been retained as 'buy' by Citigroup with a price target cut 
to 6 eur from 6.3 eur, dealers said.
In a note published this morning, Citigroup pointed out that Ryanair's share price is likely to remain weak until it gets 
better visibility on the winter months after which sharp rises are possible.
Citigroup said that it believes there are plenty of growth opportunities in Southern and Eastern Europe for Ryanair, 
in addition to France.
The broker added that it expects 11 pct earnings per share growth this year compared to Ryanairs 5 pct guidance.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Nasdaq 100 ended lower Thursday, with Activision Inc. and Celgene Corp. posting the 
biggest drops among the index's 95 declining stocks.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, 
declined 32.68 points to finish at 1,882.17. The broader Nasdaq composite fell 45.80 points to 2,541.38.
Activision was the biggest loser on the tech-heavy index, giving up $1.11, or 5.7 percent, to finish at $18.46. The 
video game publisher said the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a formal probe into stock options 
backdating at the company.
Drug developer Celgene dropped $3.43, or 5.7 percent, to $57.24.
Shares of Millicom International Cellular SA, which provides cell phone services mainly in developing countries, lost 
$3.40, or 3.9 percent, to $84.02.
On the rising side, Virgin Media Inc. gained 75 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $24.70.
Biomet Inc. jumped $1.36, or 3.1 percent, to $45.56 after a private equity consortium lifted a buyout bid for the 
orthopedic products maker to $11.4 billion, or $46 per share. A prior offer valued the company at $44 per share.
Irish discount airline operator Ryanair Holdings plc advanced 24 cents to $38.59, after falling earlier in the week on 
a warning of slower anticipated profit growth.

Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market:
NYSE
General Mills Inc., down $2.07 at $59.40
The company was downgraded by a Bear Stearns analyst, who said the stock is priced appropriately after three

Paris shares drop sharply as interest rates, M Stanley note fuel profit-taking

PARIS (Thomson Financial) - Share prices were down sharply at midday as expectations of tighter interest rates on 
both sides of the Atlantic, as well as a note from Morgan Stanley advising clients to reduce exposure to equities, 
accelerated profit-taking after recent highs, dealers said.
At 1.14 pm, the CAC-40 index was down 46.48 points or 0.76 pct at 6,032.06 on volume of 2.9 bln eur.
On the Matif, June CAC-40 futures were trading down 53.0 or 0.87 pct at 6,011.0.
The euro was at 1.3520 usd versus 1.3517 late yesterday.
The European Central Bank is widely expected to raise its key rate to 4 pct from 3.75 pct at its meeting today, with 
focus on any signals of further increases to come.
In the US, meanwhile, Wall Street closed down overnight as the markets were hit by remarks from Federal Reserve 
chairman Ben Bernanke which cooled hopes of a cut in US rates.
Worries about interest rates were compounded by a warning from Morgan Stanley about exposure to shares, which 
local dealers said fuelled selling.
Dealers also cited a subsiding of takeover speculation, with one Paris operator pointing to 'lots of silly rumours that 
have not been confirmed'.
Renault led losses on the CAC-40 -- down 3.68 eur or 3.25 pct at 109.70 -- as its record levels this week made it a 
prime target for profit-taking.
The car maker has been bouyed by high expectations about its series of product launches, starting this month.
Rival auto stock Peugeot also gave ground, shedding 1.37 or 2.33 pct to 57.52.
Another heavy faller was Air France-KLM, which like Renault has been trading at historically high levels.
The airline was trading down 0.96 or 2.61 pct at 35.80, adding to yesterday's drop of nearly 4 pct which was partly 
due to Ryanair's warning of lower profit growth this year.
Paris shares drop sharply as interest rates, M Stanley note fuel profit-taking
Carrefour dropped 1.21 or 2.24 pct to 52.88, with dealers pointing to a falling off in speculation about the property 
assets of retailers.
Rival retailer Casino was down 1.37 or 1.67 pct at 80.87.
One local dealer also noted an impact on Carrefour from its failure to acquire Spanish supermarket chain Caprabo, 
which has been bought by another Spanish retailer, Eroski.
He added that fading speculation about Carrefour has turned attention back to its weak trading in France, where it 
faces tough price competition.
Other falling blue-chips included Vallourec, which was down 3.63 or 1.56 pct at 228.37.
In an interview with Les Echos, management board chairman Pierre Verluca cooled speculation about a takeover 
offer for the steel tube maker, arguing that it has the means to remain an independent company, although it would 
consider an offer 'if we are officially approached'.
Arcelor Mittal, which has been rumoured to be interested in Vallourec, fell 0.98 or 2.08 pct to 46.18.
Banks were also out of favour in view of concerns about interest rate rises in the months ahead.
BNP Paribas was down 1.40 or 1.57 pct at 87.70, Dexia was 0.29 or 1.21 pct lower at 23.60, and Societe Generale 
was off 1.76 or 1.24 pct at 140.22.
On the second line, Eurotunnel was down 0.09 or 7.76 pct at 1.07 after chairman Jacques Gounon rejected 
rumours that the Channel Tunnel operator is expecting a takeover offer following implementation of its debt 
restructuring agreement.
Among the rare rising stocks, oil major Total added 0.21 or 0.37 pct to 56.21.
In an interview with Thomson Financial News, Jerome Schmitt, the group's vice president, said Total does 'not need 
big acquisitions to grow the business successfully' and is investing heavily to grow oil and gas output by around 5 
pct each year through 2010.
Bouygues was also outperforming the market, down 0.09 or 0.14 pct at 65.93, after reporting strong first-quarter 
results.
The conglomerate comfortably beat consensus with a 28 pct rise in net profit to 189 mln eur, and also raised its full 
year sales guidance to 28.8 bln eur from 28.6 bln.
However, it indicated in a conference call that its Bouygues Telecom division has trimmed its target for full-year 
growth in network sales to 2.5 pct versus 3 pct previously, in anticipation of caps on roaming fees for mobile calls in 
Europe.
Outside the CAC-40, a significant climber was Zodiac, up 0.96 or 1.66 pct at 58.64 after being upgraded to 'buy' 
from 'hold' at SG Securities, with a raised target price of 64 eur from 60 eur, dealers said.
In a note published this morning, SG Securities said it is very encouraged by Zodiac's proposed sale of marine 
activities to Carlyle.

Among the rare rising stocks, oil major Total added 0.21 or 0.37 pct to 56.21.
In an interview with Thomson Financial News, Jerome Schmitt, the group's vice president, said Total does 'not need 
big acquisitions to grow the business successfully' and is investing heavily to grow oil and gas output by around 5 
pct each year through 2010.
Bouygues was also outperforming the market, down 0.09 or 0.14 pct at 65.93, after reporting strong first-quarter 
results.
The conglomerate comfortably beat consensus with a 28 pct rise in net profit to 189 mln eur, and also raised its full 
year sales guidance to 28.8 bln eur from 28.6 bln.
However, it indicated in a conference call that its Bouygues Telecom division has trimmed its target for full-year 
growth in network sales to 2.5 pct versus 3 pct previously, in anticipation of caps on roaming fees for mobile calls in 
Europe.
Outside the CAC-40, a significant climber was Zodiac, up 0.96 or 1.66 pct at 58.64 after being upgraded to 'buy' 
from 'hold' at SG Securities, with a raised target price of 64 eur from 60 eur, dealers said.
In a note published this morning, SG Securities said it is very encouraged by Zodiac's proposed sale of marine 
activities to Carlyle.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Shares in Ryanair climbed nearly 2 pct in late morning deals, rebounding from 
yesterday's sharp post results losses, as ABN Amro upgraded the shares to 'buy' from 'hold', dealers said.
Yesterday, Ryanair shares fell 6.8 pct after the budget airline warned of a sharp slowdown in growth over the 
coming year as it released its full-year results.
Today, ABN Amro said Ryanair guided to a 5 pct increase in net earnings for the current year, compared to the 
broker's forecast of a 30 pct increase and the consensus forecast of 25 pct.
But it says the sharp drop-off offers a reasonable entry point to the stock, especially given the group's planned 
share buyback programme.
It repeated its 5.50 eur price target and said the upgrade is based solely on valuation.

ROUNDUP Ryanair 's FY profits up as growth slowdown looms

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC today warned it expects profit growth to 
slow over the next year as a result of softening market conditions, despite having earlier posted full-year net profit of 
401.4 mln eur -- 33 pct up on the same period last year.
The airline beat consensus forecasts for 395 mln eur, but warned of the potential slowdown in growth in spite of 
ongoing plans to expand its route network.
Ryanair said it expects yields to fall by up to 5 pct, with unit costs seen rising by 6-7 pct due in part to longer journey 
lengths and higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin.
'We think market demand will continue to soften and as a result load factors might be slightly lower,' Ryanair's 
finance director, Howard Miller told Thomson Financial News in a telephone interview this morning.
'We're guiding that the average fare will be down slightly and as a result of those two factors we think that profit 
growth won't be as fast next year as it has been this year.'
The airline expects the seasonality established over recent years to continue with the majority of the group's annual 
profits set to be generated in the first half of the year, with the possibility of a small loss being recorded during 
quarters 3 and 4.
'Our normal profile is that we make the vast majority of our profits in Q1 and Q2 and I think that trend will continue 
this year,' said Miller. 'We don't have a great deal of visibility into the winter period at the moment but we feel that 
there's a possibility that we might make a loss in Q3 and Q4.'
Over the past 12 months, Ryanair saw fuel costs increase by 50 pct to 693 mln eur. However, looking ahead, the 
carrier said it has extended fuel hedges for the remainder of fiscal 2008 with the average cost per barrel 
significantly lower than last year.
'Fuel costs will rise at a slower pace than they did last year so we expect slower growth in fuel prices,' said Miller. 
'Our average fuel price this year is about 63 usd a barrel and that equates to about 70 usd a barrel last year. In 
terms of hedging, we went from 50 pct to 90 pct in Q2 and we expect about a 10 pct reduction in the cost per barrel 
over the year.'
ROUNDUP Ryanair 's FY profits up as growth slowdown looms
Revenues were 32 pct higher at 2.237 bln eur, while passenger traffic figures increased by 22 pct to 42.5 mln.
Average fares rose 7 pct but after raising its ticket prices for the past eight quarters, the airline estimates that fares 
will have to come down by around 5 pct over the next 12 months. Miller said he hopes such enforced price 
reductions will benefit the British traveller.
'Five interest rate rises have definitely impacted the UK consumer -- they have less disposable income now,' said 
Miller. 'I think that combined with the doubling of Air Passenger Duty from 5 stg to 10 stg and the doubling of 
passenger charges at Stansted from 6 stg to 12 stg then people have less money available and they're more price 
resistant.'
Ancillary revenues grew by 40 pct due to higher passenger spend, increased penetration and the growth of excess 
baggage revenues.
'Sales of drinks and snacks, car hire, hotels, travel insurance and excess baggage charges have all been strong so 
there's a whole raft of things driving ancillaries forward,' Miller said. 'We have worked very hard on this over the last 
number of years and we said it would rise to about 20 pct of revenues -- it's presently at around 16 pct.'
Ryanair said it would continue to press for the break-up of the BAA airport monopoly and that it welcomed the 
recent OFT and Competition Commission investigation into BAA.
The airline said the current BAA Stansted plan to spend some 4 bln stg building a second runway and terminal 
'provides further proof of this monopoly'. Ryanair is also against plans to spend over 800 mln eur building a 15 
MPPA passenger terminal at Dublin Airport.
Significant cost increases associated with higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin since April, combined with 
a doubling of the UK airport departure taxes have also had a negative impact on traffic and yields.
Miller added that Ryanair would likely challenge the European Commission's (EC) review of Ryanair's proposed 
offer for Aer Lingus Group PLC, which is expected to fail to receive competition approval.
'The Irish government is not in favour of it [the proposed merger] and the EC competition authorities generally do 
what the governments want to do,' said Miller. 'It has approved other similar deals but when it comes to two carriers 
operating with less than 5 pct of the market share they decide they're not going to approve it so you can only 
assume it's a politically motivated decision.'
Despite warning of potential losses over the coming year, Ryanair 'normally easily beats its guidance', Citigroup's 
Andrew Light wrote in a note today.
Collins Stewart analyst Andrew Fitchie, meanwhile, claims that Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary may have 
'managed market expectations downwards only to go on to surpass them and we think he has good reason to do 
this now', he wrote in a research note on the airline published this morning.
Last week, Ryanair ordered 27 Boeing 737-800 planes valued at 1.9 bln usd to add new routes and lower costs. Its 
fleet has grown from 103 planes in 2006 to over 130 today.
Peter Caldwell, an equity analyst at Barclays Wealth, is of the view that although Ryanair is still cautious on its 
near-term outlook the airline is more optimistic about the long-term view.
'The recent new aircraft order implies that the group feels growth potential in the low-cost carrier space warrants 
continued capacity additions,' wrote Caldwell in a note on the airline today.
At 11.55 am, Ryanair's shares were trading 5.87 pct or 0.32 eur down at 5.05 eur.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC were lower in early morning deals after the low 
cost airline warned of a sharp slowdown in growth over the coming year at the release of its full-year results, with 
ABN Amro repeating its 'hold' stance, dealers said.
At 8.18 am, shares in Ryanair were 0.28 lower at 5.08.
Ryanair said it expects yields to fall by up to 5 pct, with unit costs seen rising by 6-7 pct due in part to longer journey 
lengths and higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin, partly offset by lower fuel costs.
'As a result we expect profit growth over the coming year to be more modest, with... maybe even small losses being 
recorded during quarters 3 and 4,' it said in a statement.
The airline posted full-year net profit up 33 pct to 401.4 mln eur, beating consensus forecasts for 395 mln eur. 
Revenues were 32 pct higher at 2.237 bln eur while passenger traffic figures increased by 22 pct to 42.5 mln.
In reaction, ABN Amro said the guidance for full-year 2008 looks to be very cautious.
The broker notes that the company sees full-year profit up by about 5 pct, compared with its forecast of 18 pct year-
on-year.
ABN Amro added, though, that it is worth noting that the company had already been talking things down following 
the April traffic statistics, so much of the news is already priced in.
On last year's results, ABN Amro said the numbers beat its own forecast, with net profit of 435.6 mln eur above its 
own forecast of 400 mln and above consensus.

PARIS (Thomson Financial) - Shares in Air France-KLM were down sharply midafternoon as the market reacted to 
a warning from low-cost carrier Ryanair that its profit growth will slow this year, with investors taking advantage of 
Air France-KLM's recent rally to claim profits, dealers said.
At 3.38 pm, Air France-KLM was down 1.30 eur or 3.40 pct at 36.96 while the CAC-40 was 45.53 points or 0.74 pct 
lower at 6,080.28 pct.
'People are talking about Ryanair,' another local dealer said, while also noting that Air France-KLM enjoyed gains 
last week on the news it is to enter the CAC-40 index later this month.
Reporting full-year results this morning, low-cost carrier Ryanair said it expects profit growth to slow in the current 
year as a result of softening market conditions.
Specifically, the company expects lower load rates and lower average fares, as well as higher costs resulting partly 
from longer journeys and higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin.
Another local dealer conceded that 'people are extrapolating Ryanair's warning' and applying it to Air France-KLM.
But he cautioned that 'Ryanair is just a pretext' for profit-taking on a highly-valued share in a falling market.
'Ryanair has nothing like the same business model as Air France-KLM,' he stressed.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is expected to see its full year net profit 
increase by some 20 pct to around 395 mln eur when it unveils its annual results today.
The Irish carrier, which last week said it was buying 27 more Boeing 737-800 jets worth 1.9 bln usd, is also 
expected to 'slightly improve on its guidance for FY07,' according to UBS analyst, Tim Marshall.
However, the key to earnings next year is likely to be the firm's comments on the current revenue environment. 
Ryanair has been reducing prices on seats in the busier summer months and is talking about softness in yield, 
which will be the key point of interest for investors.
In a bid to combat this, Ryanair last month said it would open its 20th European base at Bristol International Airport 
in southwest England. The carrier said it would launch 13 new routes from the airport by the year-end including 
Bratislava in Slovakia, Budapest, Derry and Knock in Ireland, Dinard in France, Katowice, Poznan, Rzeszow and 
Wroclaw in Poland, Milan, Porto in Portugal, Riga in Latvia and Salzburg in Austria.
The no-frills carrier is also expected to update the market on its plans to take over Irish carrier Aer Lingus Group 
PLC.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary last month said he would appeal if the EU opposes its bid for Aer Lingus 
when it concludes its inquiry in July.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC today warned it expects its profit growth to 
slow next year as a result of softening market conditions, which are likely to be reflected in lower load factors and 
yields.
The budget carrier expects yields to fall by around 5 pct, unit costs to rise by upwards of 6 pct due in part to longer 
journey lengths and higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin, Ryanair's finance director, Howard Miller told 
Thomson Financial News in a telephone interview this morning.
'We think market demand will continue to soften and as a result load factors might be slightly lower,' said Miller. 
'We're guiding that the average fare will be down slightly and as a result of those two factors we think that profit 
growth won't be as fast next year as it has been this year.'
After raising its ticket prices for the past eight quarters, the airline estimates that fares will have to come down by 
around 5 pct over the next 12 months. Miller said he hopes such enforced price reductions will benefit the British 
traveller.
'Five interest rate rises have definitely impacted the UK consumer -- they have less disposable income now,' said 
Miller. 'I think that combined with the doubling of Air Passenger Duty from 5 stg to 10 stg and the doubling of 
passenger charges at Stansted from 6 stg to 12 stg then people have less money available and they're more price 
resistant.'
Despite this imminent slowdown, Ryanair today saw its full year net profit increase by 33 pct to 401.4 mln eur, 
beating consensus forecasts for 395 mln eur. Revenues were 32 pct higher at 2.237 bln eur while passenger traffic 
figures increased by 22 pct to 42.5 mln.
Full year fuel costs increased by 50 pct to 693 mln eur. However, looking ahead, the carrier said it has extended 
fuel hedges to 90 pct for the remainder of fiscal 2008 at an average cost per barrel which is 10 pct lower than last 
year.
'Fuel costs will rise at a slower pace than they did last year so we expect slower growth in fuel prices,' said Miller. 
'Our average fuel price this year is about 63 usd a barrel and that equates to about 70 usd a barrel last year. In 
INTERVIEW Ryanair sees slowdown in profit growth despite strong FY results
terms of hedging, we went from 50 pct to 90 pct in Q2 and we expect about a 10 pct reduction in the cost per barrel 
over the year.'
Ancillary revenues grew by 40 pct due to higher passenger spend, increased penetration and the growth of excess 
baggage revenues.
'Sales of drinks and snacks, car hire, hotels, travel insurance and excess baggage charges have all been strong so 
there's a whole raft of things driving ancillaries forward,' explained Miller. 'We have worked very hard on this over 
the last number of years and we said it would rise to about 20 pct of revenues - it's presently at around 16 pct.'
The airline expects the seasonality established over recent years to continue with the majority of the group's annual 
profits set to be generated in the first half of the year, with the possibility of a small loss being recorded during 
quarters 3 and 4.

for Aer Lingus Group PLC, which is expected to fail to receive competition approval.
'The Irish government is not in favour of it [the proposed merger] and the EC competition authorities generally do 
what the governments want to do,' said Miller. 'It has approved other similar deals but when it comes to two carriers 
operating with less than 5 pct of the market share they decide they're not going to approve it so you can only 
assume it's a politically motivated decision.'

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Europe's leading exchanges ended lower on a pullback on Wall Street following 
data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that lowered hopes of a cut in US interest rates.
The Dow Jones STOXX 50 fell 20.64 points to 3,9640.50, while the DJ STOXX 600, a broader gauge of European 
performance, dropped 2.41 points to 396.61. The DJ Euro STOXX 50 was down 24.63 points at 4,513.18.
After putting in solid gains in the early going, European stocks pulled back in afternoon trading as Wall Street 
retreated after Bernanke restated his concern about inflationary pressures in the US economy.
Stronger-than-expected data on the US services sector reinforced the view that the US central bank would not cut 
interest rates anytime soon.
Financial services companies, auto makers and the construction sector were among the biggest fallers in a fairly 
broad-based pullback although the chemical sector and oil and gas companies managed to eke out a gain.
The airline sector was another major decliner after Ryanair Holdings tumbled 6.8 pct as the low-cost airline warned 
of slowing growth for the rest of the year. Rival EasyJet fell in sympathy, giving up 6.8 pct.
British Airways also fell 1.8 pct after the airline notched a 2.1 pct decline in passenger traffic in May, blaming difficult 
year-over-year comparisons and the timing of bank holidays.

The airline sector was another major decliner after Ryanair Holdings tumbled 6.8 pct as the low-cost airline warned 
of slowing growth for the rest of the year. Rival EasyJet fell in sympathy, giving up 6.8 pct.
British Airways also fell 1.8 pct after the airline notched a 2.1 pct decline in passenger traffic in May, blaming difficult 
year-over-year comparisons and the timing of bank holidays.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Europe's leading exchanges ended lower on a pullback on Wall Street following 
data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that lowered hopes of a cut in US interest rates.
The Dow Jones STOXX 50 fell 20.64 points to 3,9640.50, while the DJ STOXX 600, a broader gauge of European 
performance, dropped 2.41 points to 396.61. The DJ Euro STOXX 50 was down 24.63 points at 4,513.18.
After putting in solid gains in the early going, European stocks pulled back in afternoon trading as Wall Street 
retreated after Bernanke restated his concern about inflationary pressures in the US economy.
Stronger-than-expected data on the US services sector reinforced the view that the US central bank would not cut 
interest rates anytime soon.
Financial services companies, auto makers and the construction sector were among the biggest fallers in a fairly 
broad-based pullback although the chemical sector and oil and gas companies managed to eke out a gain.
The airline sector was another major decliner after Ryanair Holdings tumbled 6.8 pct as the low-cost airline warned 
of slowing growth for the rest of the year. Rival EasyJet fell in sympathy, giving up 6.8 pct.
British Airways also fell 1.8 pct after the airline notched a 2.1 pct decline in passenger traffic in May, blaming difficult

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Europe's leading exchanges experienced lacklustre trade this afternoon, taking a 
breathe from recent highs, ahead of an expected lower opening on Wall Street, dealerrs said.
However, market watchers are anticipating positive momentum to pick up again in the coming days.
At 12.34 pm, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 was down 5.14 points at 3,956.10 but the DJ STOXX 600 tacked on 0.63 
points to 398.39.
The DJ Euro STOXX 50 Index, which tracks the performance of blue-chip companies in 12 countries using the 
euro, was down 9.59 points to 4,528.77.
Looking ahead, Wall Street is looking at a lower open as some investors choose to lock in profits ahead of a speech 
from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and key services data.
According to spread bettors IG Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open down 18 points at 
13,658.
But traders are optimistic that we are not looking ahead to a large correction.
'I think the fact that the market largely shrugged off losses in Chinese stocks, shows the strength of the market right 
now.'
Back in Europe, traders also expect the markets to pick up steam again in the upcoming days.
'We are testing new benchmarks for a couple of days and will take the next step thereafter,' one trader said.
One of the main losers today was Ryanair, which, after presenting solid earnings, which exceeded expectations, 
took a tumble after it warned investors that a sharp slowdown in growth over the coming year may lie ahead.
Ryanair said it expects yields to fall by up to 5 pct, with unit costs seen rising by 6-7 pct due in part to longer journey 
lengths and higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin, partly offset by lower fuel costs.
'As a result we expect profit growth over the coming year to be more modest, with... maybe even small losses being 
recorded during quarters 3 and 4,' the company said in a statement.
Euroshares in lacklustre trade ahead of an expected lower Wall Street open
At last check, Ryanair shares were off 6.83 pct.
The announcement had an immediate effect on rival Easyjet, which dropped 3.82 pct.
Over on the automotive sector, Renault was once again one of the sharpest gainers, after Deutsche Bank was one 
of the last in a long list of brokers to put out a bullish note on the stock, which jumped 2.26 pct.
The German broker lifted its price target on the car maker to 144 eur from 117 eur and reiterated its 'buy' rating.
A strong product offensive as well as anticipated reductions in costs are the main reasons behind the target price 
hike, the broker said in a note to clients, adding that the share price may hit the 160 mark in the next two years.
Since the start of the year, Renault shares are up about 25 pct.
Shares in rival Peugeot SA gained in sympathy, up 0.72 pct.
Air Liquide gained momentum midday, up 1.51 pct, as rumours circulated that the chemicals company might be the 
target of a leveraged buyout.
A Paris-based dealer said, 'The rumour's coming out of Geneva, and we're hearing it's Wendel Investissement 
because it's placing Bureau Veritas in the market.'
Another rumour circulating the French market was speculation that Bouygues may be considering selling its stake 
in TF1 to fund a potential acquisition of Areva.
While the stock was 1.80 pct higher at last check, traders and analysts discarded the possibility and the company 
denied that it is mulling a sale.
Market watchers were convinced however that a buy out of Areva was on the books eventually, but stated that the 
company would find other means to fund such an acquisition.
Over on the German market, shares in MDAX-listed Merck KGaA were leading their index as they gained 5.42 pct, 
after rumours emerged that the company may soon be joining blue-chips on the DAX.
Traders also pointed to new data released yesterday that showed that Merck's UFT therapy in combination with 
leucovorin has an 'excellent response rate' as a first-line treatment for patients with matastatic colorectal cancer. 
The release followed other positive statements about Merck anti-cancer drugs yesterday.
In Britain, the focus was also on a potential indices reshuffle, with the UK's biggest house builder Barratt 
Developments looking more likely to replace Bradford & Bingley on the FTSE 100, based on yesterday's closing 
price.
Drax's fate remains uncertain ahead of today's close after it was only just saved from demotion by M&A talk at the 
beginning of the month.
Barratt added 0.85 pct, while Bradford & Bingley gained 0.24 pct and Drax 2.06 pct.
On the M&A front, AEM SpA and ASM Brescia SpA, the two northern Italian utility companies that yesterday 
announced plans to merge, rallied thanks to an upbeat note by Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley has raised its rating on ASM to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight' with an increased target price of 5.4 
eur, up from 4.4 previously, following the announcement of the merger.
In a note published today, the broker also repeated its 'overweight' stance on AEM with an increased target price of 
3.3 eur, up from 3.0.
At last check, AEM was up 5.4 pct while shares in ASM Brescia added 4.0 pct.
Euroshares in lacklustre trade ahead of an expected lower Wall Street open
Avenir Telecom gained 6.2 pct after the mobile phone distributor indicated that it expects a return to organic growth 
as it posted in-line results for the 12 months to March.
Staying in telecoms, Carphone Warehouse shares rose to their best level since mid-February after the company 
reported full-year profits above its previous forecasts, with Evolution reiterating its 'buy' recommendation and 360 
pence price target. Carphone shares were last up 7.0 pct.
Meanwhile, over on the steel sector, voestalpine gained on the back of news that its bid for over 50 pct of shares in 
Boehler-Uddeholm AG was successful.
'The basic underperformance of the stock that we flagged on May 24 after voestalpine increased its offer created a 
buying opportunity,' said Credit Suisse analyst Michael Shillaker.
'After today, if you put the two stocks together they look cheap compared to other stocks in the European sector,' he 
added.
At last check, voestalpine gained 1.44 pct, as Boehler-Uddeholm rose 1.28 pct.
In the Netherlands, the banking sector was the main focus of attention today, and ING gained 1.02 pct on the back 
of its 5 bln eur share buy-back programme announcement last night.
ABN Amro, on the other hand, declined 0.38, with investors showing disappointment over the ending of talks 
between the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of America on the sale of ABN's LaSalle unit in the US. Successful 
talks could have simplified the ongoing bidding war for the Dutch bank.

Euroshares rise on strength in mining, oil stocks; Wall St, China rebound help

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Europe's leading exchanges rose in morning trading amid strength in mining 
stocks and oil and gas companies, while shares in Renault rallied on an upbeat note from analysts at Deutsche 
Bank.
Overnight strength on Wall Street and a rebound in Chinese stocks also underpinned gains.
At 9.28 am, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 was up 7.99 points at 3,969.23 while the DJ STOXX 600, a broader gauge 
of European performance, rose 0.71 point to 399.74. The DJ Euro STOXX 50 climbed 6.90 points to 4,544.65.
'We still have a continued positive environment for equities,' said Adrian Darnley, head of trading at Resolution 
Asset Management. 'Global demand is fine, interest rates are going up around the world but at a moderate pace, 
M&A activity remains solid and valuations are reasonable.'
'Day to day that doesn't change. There are one or two specific stories like Michael O'Leary's cautious comments on 
the UK low-cost airline market but in the context of the overall market, that's not an issue,' Darnley added, referring 
to the chief executive of Ryanair, who warned of slowdown in growth for the rest of the year.
Among the sectors seeing gains, metals and mining stocks were the biggest gainers amid continuing strength in 
raw materials prices. Oil and gas stocks rose as crude prices remained firm. Car makers and auto parts firms 
gained, helped by a price target upgrade for Renault while insurers rallied after Merrill Lynch upgraded its stance on 
UK companies Old Mutual PLC, Standard Life PLC, and St James' Place PLC to 'buy' from 'neutral.' The broker 
said the need to drive down expenses coupled with impending regulatory changes will likely lead to consolidation 
among UK insurers.
On the earnings front, shares in Ryanair Holdings fell to their worst level in over five months after the low cost 
airline warned of a sharp slowdown in growth over the coming year even as its full-year profit beat analyst 
estimates.
Ryanair said it expects yields to fall by up to 5 pct, with unit costs seen rising by 6-7 pct due in part to longer journey 
lengths and higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin, partly offset by lower fuel costs.
'As a result we expect profit growth over the coming year to be more modest, with... maybe even small losses being 
recorded during quarters 3 and 4,' the company said in a statement.
Euroshares rise on strength in mining, oil stocks; Wall St, China rebound help
At last check, Ryanair shares were off 4.2 pct.
Renault SA shares climbed 2.7 pct as broker Deutsche Bank lifted its price target on the car maker to 144 eur from 
117 eur and reiterated its 'buy' rating.
A strong product offensive as well as anticipated reductions in costs are the main reasons behind the target price 
hike, the broker said in a note to clients, adding that the share price may hit the 160 mark in the next two years.
Since the start of the year, Renault shares are up about 25 pct.
Shares in rival Peugeot SA gained in sympathy, up 1.3 pct.
Among oil and gas companies, shares in Royal Dutch Shell tacked on 0.4 pct after Cazenove upgraded the 
company to 'in-line' from 'underperform,' on valuation grounds and the prospect for continued strong earnings in 
2007.
The broker's upgrade also comes as it upgrades its oil price forecast to 60 usd from 55 usd for the 2007-10 period 
and beyond.
Societe Generale also lifted its recommendation on Royal Dutch Shell to 'hold' from 'sell' as the broker also lifted its 
long-term forecast for Brent crude to 50 usd a barrel.
On the M&A front, AEM SpA and ASM Brescia SpA, the two northern Italian utility companies that yesterday 
announced plans to merge, rallied thanks to an upbeat note by Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley has raised its rating on ASM to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight' with an increased target price of 5.4 
eur, up from 4.4 previously, following the announcement of the merger.
In a note published today, the broker also repeated its 'overweight' stance on AEM with an increased target price of 
3.3 eur, up from 3.0.
At last check, AEM was up 4.8 pct while shares in ASM Brescia added 3.3 pct.
Avenir Telecom gained 3.7 pct after the mobile phone distributor indicated that it expects a return to organic growth 
as it posted in-line results for the 12 months to March.
Staying in telecom, shares in Telenor ASA rose 1.3 pct after investors welcomed the telecoms firm's strong stance 
on the future of its operations in Russia and Ukraine.
According to dealers in Oslo, Telenor is benefiting from a report in today's Finansavisen newspaper, in which the 
chief executive of the firm's Russian business, Kjell Morten Johnsen, is quoted as saying that Telenor will pay a 'full 
and fair price but not more' if Alfa, the Russian investment group, wants to sell its stake in Vimpelcom, the Russian 
mobile operator.
Telenor is involved in a legal dispute with Alfa over control of Kyivstar in Ukraine.
Carphone Warehouse shares rose to their best level since mid-February after the company reported full-year profits 
above its previous forecasts, with Evolution reiterating its 'buy' recommendation and 360 pence price target. 
Carphone shares were last up 3.6 pct.
Shares in Merck KgaA surged 6.8 pct as speculation mounts that the pharmaceutical company may replace Altana 
AG in the blue-chip DAX. Altana shares, meanwhile, were up 1.2 pct

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Europe's leading exchanges rose in morning trading amid strength in mining 
stocks and oil and gas companies, while shares in Renault rallied on an upbeat note from analysts at Deutsche 
Bank.
Overnight strength on Wall Street and a rebound in Chinese stocks also underpinned gains.
At 9.28 am, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 was up 7.99 points at 3,969.23 while the DJ STOXX 600, a broader gauge 
of European performance, rose 0.71 point to 399.74. The DJ Euro STOXX 50 climbed 6.90 points to 4,544.65.
'We still have a continued positive environment for equities,' said Adrian Darnley, head of trading at Resolution 
Asset Management. 'Global demand is fine, interest rates are going up around the world but at a moderate pace, 
M&A activity remains solid and valuations are reasonable.'
'Day to day that doesn't change. There are one or two specific stories like Michael O'Leary's cautious comments on 
the UK low-cost airline market but in the context of the overall market, that's not an issue,' Darnley added, referring 
to the chief executive of Ryanair, who warned of slowdown in growth for the rest of the year.
Among the sectors seeing gains, metals and mining stocks were the biggest gainers amid continuing strength in 
raw materials prices. Oil and gas stocks rose as crude prices remained firm. Car makers and auto parts firms 
gained, helped by a price target upgrade for Renault while insurers rallied after Merrill Lynch upgraded its stance on 
UK companies Old Mutual PLC, Standard Life PLC, and St James' Place PLC to 'buy' from 'neutral.' The broker 
said the need to drive down expenses coupled with impending regulatory changes will likely lead to consolidation 
among UK insurers.
On the earnings front, shares in Ryanair Holdings fell to their worst level in over five months after the low cost 
airline warned of a sharp slowdown in growth over the coming year even as its full-year profit beat analyst 
estimates.
Ryanair said it expects yields to fall by up to 5 pct, with unit costs seen rising by 6-7 pct due in part to longer journey 
lengths and higher airport charges at Stansted and Dublin, partly offset by lower fuel costs.
'As a result we expect profit growth over the coming year to be more modest, with... maybe even small losses being 
recorded during quarters 3 and 4,' the company said in a statement.

At last check, Ryanair shares were off 4.2 pct.
Renault SA shares climbed 2.7 pct as broker Deutsche Bank lifted its price target on the car maker to 144 eur from 
117 eur and reiterated its 'buy' rating.
A strong product offensive as well as anticipated reductions in costs are the main reasons behind the target price 
hike, the broker said in a note to clients, adding that the share price may hit the 160 mark in the next two years.
Since the start of the year, Renault shares are up about 25 pct.
Shares in rival Peugeot SA gained in sympathy, up 1.3 pct.
Among oil and gas companies, shares in Royal Dutch Shell tacked on 0.4 pct after Cazenove upgraded the 
company to 'in-line' from 'underperform,' on valuation grounds and the prospect for continued strong earnings in 
2007.
The broker's upgrade also comes as it upgrades its oil price forecast to 60 usd from 55 usd for the 2007-10 period 
and beyond.
Societe Generale also lifted its recommendation on Royal Dutch Shell to 'hold' from 'sell' as the broker also lifted its 
long-term forecast for Brent crude to 50 usd a barrel.
On the M&A front, AEM SpA and ASM Brescia SpA, the two northern Italian utility companies that yesterday 
announced plans to merge, rallied thanks to an upbeat note by Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley has raised its rating on ASM to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight' with an increased target price of 5.4 
eur, up from 4.4 previously, following the announcement of the merger.
In a note published today, the broker also repeated its 'overweight' stance on AEM with an increased target price of 
3.3 eur, up from 3.0.
At last check, AEM was up 4.8 pct while shares in ASM Brescia added 3.3 pct.
Avenir Telecom gained 3.7 pct after the mobile phone distributor indicated that it expects a return to organic growth 
as it posted in-line results for the 12 months to March.
Staying in telecom, shares in Telenor ASA rose 1.3 pct after investors welcomed the telecoms firm's strong stance 
on the future of its operations in Russia and Ukraine.
According to dealers in Oslo, Telenor is benefiting from a report in today's Finansavisen newspaper, in which the 
chief executive of the firm's Russian business, Kjell Morten Johnsen, is quoted as saying that Telenor will pay a 'full 
and fair price but not more' if Alfa, the Russian investment group, wants to sell its stake in Vimpelcom, the Russian 
mobile operator.
Telenor is involved in a legal dispute with Alfa over control of Kyivstar in Ukraine.
Carphone Warehouse shares rose to their best level since mid-February after the company reported full-year profits 
above its previous forecasts, with Evolution reiterating its 'buy' recommendation and 360 pence price target. 
Carphone shares were last up 3.6 pct.
Shares in Merck KgaA surged 6.8 pct as speculation mounts that the pharmaceutical company may replace Altana 
AG in the blue-chip DAX. Altana shares, meanwhile, were up 1.2 pct

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Europe's leading exchanges opened a little firmer this morning, pulled higher by 
Wall Street and the Nikkei, and ending a very short-lived breather yesterday following all time highs seen last week, 
dealers said.
At 8.28 am, the STOXX 50 was up 6.64 points at 3967.88 and the STOXX 600 was 0.43 points higher at 399.45.
Last night, the DJIA closed 8.21 points or 0.06 pct higher at 13,676.32 after a down session on Monday, eking out a 
gain as investors brushed off another slide in Chinese stocks.
The S&P 500, meanwhile, rose 2.84, or 0.18 percent, to 1,539.18, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.37, or 
0.17 pct, to 2,618.29.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index was 80.39 points firmer at 18,053.81, rather unimpressed by losses in China, while the 
Hang Seng index rebounded, gaining 134.48 points to 20,861.42.
Oil prices edged lower in Asian trade, giving up some of the sharp gains made overnight on continued concerns 
about tight US gasoline supplies.
New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for delivery in July, was down 17 cents at 66.04 usd per 
barrel after a gain of 1.13 usd in US trading Monday.
Brent North Sea crude for July was down five cents at 70.35 usd.
In Europe this morning, French automakers were lifted, after Renault received a bullish target price increase by 
Goldman Sachs.
A strong product offensive as well as anticipated reductions in costs are the main reasons behind the target price 
hike, the broker said in a note to clients, adding that the share price may hit the 160 mark in the next two years.
As Renault gained 2.8 pct, Peugeot added 1.5 pct and French tyre maker Michelin rose some 1.1 pct higher.
Major airlines were losing ground in morning trade, after Ryanair posted full year net profit up 33 pct to 401.4 mln 
eur, but warned of a sharp slowdown in growth over the coming year while nevertheless expanding its route 
network.
Euroshares open firmer, pulled higher by Wall Street and Tokyo
One London-based trader commented however that a 6 pct slide was a 'bit overdone to' him.
The stock fell 5.9 pct at last check, while Easyjet retreated 1.24 pct as British Airways lost 0.75 pct and Lufthansa 
declined 0.42 pct.
Tourism giant TUI, meanwhile, gained momentum, adding 1.28 pct, after the EU Commission approved its merger 
with First Choice, while it will need to divest of its Irish 'Budget Travel' business'.
First Choice was 2.55 pct higher.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Leading European exchanges are set for a lower opening - taking a breather from 
recent highs - with investors continuing on a profit-making spree ahead of tomorrow's ECB announcement on 
interest rates, dealers said.
Last night, the DJIA closed 8.21 points or 0.06 pct higher at 13,676.32 after a down session on Monday, eking out a 
gain as investors brushed off another slide in Chinese stocks.
The S&P 500, meanwhile, rose 2.84, or 0.18 percent, to 1,539.18, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.37, or 
0.17 pct, to 2,618.29.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index at midday was 55.10 points firmer at 18,028.52, rather unimpressed by losses in 
China, while the Hang Seng index ended its morning session by falling 59.95 points to 20,669.64.
Oil prices edged lower in Asian trade, giving up some of the sharp gains made overnight on continued concerns 
about tight US gasoline supplies.
New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for delivery in July, was down 17 cents at 66.04 usd per 
barrel after a gain of 1.13 usd in US trading Monday.
Brent North Sea crude for July was down five cents at 70.35 usd.
Back in Europe, investors are expected to continue with yesterday's profit taking spree ahead of tomorrow's 
European Central Bank announcement on interest rates.
European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet is to give a speech at the International Monetary Conference 
in South Africa at midday, which should be a key interest this morning, as the market anticipates a further interest 
rate hike to 4 pct tomorrow.
Further on the macroeconomic front, the euro zone purchasing managers' index is due in the next few hours, which 
acts as an indicator for factory production - and is expected to edge up slightly to 57.2 in May from 57.0 in April, 
according to a survey performed by Thomson Financial News.
Euroshares outlook - market set for a breather ahead of tomorrow's ECB decision
On the company's front, the airline industry will be in focus, as Ryanair just presented a great set of numbers, as 
net profit rose by 33 pct to 401.4 mln eur and with full year passenger traffic up by some 22 pct to 42.5 mln eur.
The results are expected to give the stock a boost, while investors await May traffic figures by peer British Airways, 
later in the morning.
Meanwhile, over on the steel sector, Voestalpine is set to make a fresh start this morning, after just confirming 
market expectations that its bid for over 50 pct of shares in Boehler-Uddeholm AG was successful.

Back in Europe, investors are expected to continue with yesterday's profit taking spree ahead of tomorrow's 
European Central Bank announcement on interest rates.
European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet is to give a speech at the International Monetary Conference 
in South Africa at midday, which should be a key interest this morning, as the market anticipates a further interest 
rate hike to 4 pct tomorrow.
Further on the macroeconomic front, the euro zone purchasing managers' index is due in the next few hours, which 
acts as an indicator for factory production - and is expected to edge up slightly to 57.2 in May from 57.0 in April, 
according to a survey performed by Thomson Financial News.
Euroshares outlook - market set for a breather ahead of tomorrow's ECB decision
On the company's front, the airline industry will be in focus, as Ryanair just presented a great set of numbers, as 
net profit rose by 33 pct to 401.4 mln eur and with full year passenger traffic up by some 22 pct to 42.5 mln eur.
The results are expected to give the stock a boost, while investors await May traffic figures by peer British Airways, 
later in the morning.
Meanwhile, over on the steel sector, Voestalpine is set to make a fresh start this morning, after just confirming 
market expectations that its bid for over 50 pct of shares in Boehler-Uddeholm AG was successful.

NEW YORK (AP) - Stock prices are lower in early trading after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke implied 
the central bank has little reason to lower interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average is down 36.57 at 13,639.85, while the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 6.89 to 
2,611.40 and the Standard & Poor's 500 is off 3.97 at 1,535,21.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech by satellite to the International Monetary Fund in South Africa Tuesday 
spurred traders to sell, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up to 
new highs. Bernanke said in prepared comments that the economy will recover from its recent feeble performance, 
despite a housing slump that 'appears likely to remain a drag on economic growth for somewhat longer than 
previously expected.'
Bernanke's forecast of rebounding growth, as well as his comments that inflation is 'ebbing' but remains 'somewhat 
elevated,' made it appear unlikely the Fed will lower rates anytime soon, a disappointment for investors.
After the market opens, investors will be examining the Institute for Supply Management's May index on non-
manufacturing industries, scheduled to be released at 10 a.m. EDT. According to the median estimate of 
economists surveyed by Thomson Financial, the market expects the index to hold steady at 56.0, the same reading 
as in April.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, a diverse group of industries that represents about 80 
percent of U.S. economic activity and includes retailing, banking, construction and agriculture. Investors are hoping 
the report will indicate that the service sector is still expanding. Growth that is too robust could stoke worries about 
the Fed raising interest rates later in the year, however. On Friday, the ISM's manufacturing index came in above 
expectations.
On Monday, the three major indexes made small gains, with the Dow and the S&P closing at new records.
In takeover news, private equity firms Silver Lake and TPG Capital confirmed late Monday they made an $8.2 billion 
bid for Avaya Inc. The telecommunications company agreed to the offer, and its stock rose more than 2 percent in 
pre-market trading.
Stock prices slip in early trading
In other corporate news, Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday amid higher fuel 
prices and strong competition, but made a cautious forecast for 2007. The Irish airline's U.S. shares fell more than 4 
percent in pre-market trading.
The dollar was lower against other major currencies, while gold prices edged higher.
Crude oil futures fell 36 cents to $65.85 a barrel in preopening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, after rising more than $1 a barrel Monday.
In overseas trading, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index increased 2.6 percent after plummeting 8.3 percent 
a day earlier. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.45 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.42 percent, Germany's 
DAX index was down 0.84 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.65 percent.

STOCKS: Wall Street recovered from a mostly negative Monday, clawing into positive territory as investors tried to 
brush off an 8.3 pct slide in Chinese stocks triggered by the Chinese government's attempt to cool the country's 
market boom.
Meanwhile, the US Commerce Department reported orders to US factories were weaker than expected in April -- 
growing by 0.3 pct, and disappointing analyst expectations of a 0.7 pct rise, compared with a 3.1 pct jump in March.
Investors might find some information to trade with the release of the Institute of Supply Management's service 
sector index on Tuesday, but not much other information is expected.
FOREX: The US dollar was weakened by the lower-than-expected factory orders data.
The euro climbed to 1.3488 usd in late New York trade from 1.3443 Friday. The pound rose to 1.9904 usd from 
1.9821 while the dollar fell to 121.82 yen from 122.06 yen, even as China's main stock index plunged to its biggest 
one-day fall since a February drop that triggered a global market sell-off.
Thomson Financial Europe AM at a glance share guide: Stocks mixed, dollar weak
The market is watching economic data to glean a direction regarding interest rates. The Fed has maintained 
interest rates for several months now, while the European Central Bank is expected to raise rates. The Bank of 
England
is also expected to keep its rate unchanged when it meets Thursday. Higher interest rates can boost a currency by 
making investments denominated in it more attractive.
In other trading, the dollar bought 1.0588 cad, down from 1.0618 cad, and 1.2235 sfr, down from 1.2303.
BONDS: US Treasury prices rose on hopes the lower-than-expected economic data will mean an interest rate cut 
this year. Rate cuts are used to kickstart a flagging economy. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note 
fell to 4.93 pct from 4.96 pct late Friday.
OIL: Oil prices rose in New York despite a Nigerian militant group announcing a one-month cease-fire and a US 
gasoline pipe recommencing supply. A barrel of light sweet crude rose 1.13 usd to 66.21 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile
Exchange.
METALS: Gold prices rose in New York on the back of a weakening dollar, as this boosts the precious metal's 
appeal as an alternative investment. Gold for August rose 0.2 pct to 13.77 usd an ounce on the Nymex.

    STOCKS: Asian stocks were mixed today. Japanese shares ended the morning session firmer, investors 
having been cheered by the gains on Wall Street overnight. Hong Kong share prices were firmer in early 
Thomson Financial Europe AM at a glance share guide: Stocks mixed, dollar weak
trade, supported by continued fund inflows as some institutions shift capital out of China due to 
volatility there. Manila shares were weaker in the middle of the session as investors locked-in profits, 
taking a pause after the main index hit record highs in recent sessions and disregarding the sustained 
uptrend in important markets in East Asia this morning.
    BONDS: Japanese government bonds ended the morning session mixed because of uncertainty among 
investors about the outlook for interest rates here and in the US. Investors kept to the sidelines while 
they awaited the results of today's auction of 10-year government bonds and the release this week of 
important economic data. 
    FOREX: The US dollar kept its weak tone against other major currencies in Sydney morning trade after 
players took profits overnight on the gains in the greenback that had been due to strong US employment 
figures released Friday. The selling of the dollar overnight had been relatively slow, with players 
showing a preference for switching to high-yielding currencies and to the euro in anticipation of an 
increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank Wednesday. 
    OIL: Prices edged lower in Asian trade, giving up some of the sharp gains made overnight on continued 
concerns about tight US gasoline supplies. At 0300 GMT, New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet 
crude for delivery in July, was down 17 cents at 66.04 usd per barrel after a gain of 1.13 usd in US 
trading Monday. The market was also keeping an eye out on the approaching Atlantic hurricane season after 
US weather experts and forecasters predicted an 'active' season ahead. 
    METALS: Gold bounced back to hit a fresh two-week high, as investors continued to be cheered by news 
the European Central Bank does not plan further sales of the metal and with strength in crude prices 
helping underpin gains. Other precious metals rose yesterday, with platinum rising to 1,294 usd against 
1,290 and silver edging up to 13.74 usd against 13.66. Palladium meanwhile was relatively flat at 368 usd 
against 370. Copper extended gains made Friday on news of a sharp fall in LME inventories, and as traders 
focused on possible strike action in Mexico. Elsewhere, lead bucked the rising trend in metals, falling to 
2,640 usd a tonne against 2,367 on profit taking after last week's stellar gains. Meanwhile nickel was up 
at 47,750 usd against 47,500, zinc was flat at 3,770 usd, aluminium edged down to 2,786 usd against 2,788, 
while tin rose to 13,975 usd against 13,905.

STOCKS: UK blue chips closed a touch lower, as Wall Street traded in the red amid weaker-than-expected factory 
data and after severe declines in Chinese stocks, with property sector losses. Utility firms will be in the spotlight this 
week, with four companies due to report final results between today and Thursday. Brokers expect United Utilities 
PLC to report a 17-18 pct rise in full-year pretax profit today. Focus will also remain on Royal Bank of Scotland as 
the bank announces its trading performance.
BONDS: European government bonds remained somewhat higher yesterday, US factory orders data came in 
weaker-than-expected. In the UK, gilts were mixed after a delayed open due to technical problems at the exchange 
yesterday morning.
The Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday, but until the risk of a surprise 
hike is out of the way, analysts said gilts will have a difficult time gaining any significant momentum.
FOREX: The euro gained from hawkish comments by European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet 
overnight, and from speculation that the ECB will raise its inflation forecasts.
METALS: Gold bounced back from earlier falls to hit a fresh two-week high of 672.12 usd, as investors continued to 
be cheered by news that the ECB does not plan further sales of the metal and with strength in crude prices helping 
underpin gains. Copper extended Friday's gains on news of a sharp fall in LME inventories. At 1345 BST (1245 
GMT), LME copper for three-month delivery was up at 7,498 usd a tonne against Friday's close of 7,450 usd. In 
other metals, nickel was up at 47,750 usd against 47,500, zinc was flat at 3,770 usd, aluminium edged down to 
2,786 usd against 2,788, while tin rose to 13,975 usd against 13,905. Oil prices reversed earlier losses and rose on 
concerns of a tight gasoline supply outlook in the US. At 1420 in London (1320 GMT), benchmark Brent crude 
contracts for July delivery were up 45 cents at 69.52 usd a barrel.

they awaited the results of today's auction of 10-year government bonds and the release this week of 
important economic data. 
    FOREX: The US dollar kept its weak tone against other major currencies in Sydney morning trade after 
players took profits overnight on the gains in the greenback that had been due to strong US employment 
figures released Friday. The selling of the dollar overnight had been relatively slow, with players 
showing a preference for switching to high-yielding currencies and to the euro in anticipation of an 
increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank Wednesday. 
    OIL: Prices edged lower in Asian trade, giving up some of the sharp gains made overnight on continued 
concerns about tight US gasoline supplies. At 0300 GMT, New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet 
crude for delivery in July, was down 17 cents at 66.04 usd per barrel after a gain of 1.13 usd in US 
trading Monday. The market was also keeping an eye out on the approaching Atlantic hurricane season after 
US weather experts and forecasters predicted an 'active' season ahead. 
    METALS: Gold bounced back to hit a fresh two-week high, as investors continued to be cheered by news 
the European Central Bank does not plan further sales of the metal and with strength in crude prices 
helping underpin gains. Other precious metals rose yesterday, with platinum rising to 1,294 usd against 
1,290 and silver edging up to 13.74 usd against 13.66. Palladium meanwhile was relatively flat at 368 usd 
against 370. Copper extended gains made Friday on news of a sharp fall in LME inventories, and as traders 
focused on possible strike action in Mexico. Elsewhere, lead bucked the rising trend in metals, falling to 
2,640 usd a tonne against 2,367 on profit taking after last week's stellar gains. Meanwhile nickel was up 
at 47,750 usd against 47,500, zinc was flat at 3,770 usd, aluminium edged down to 2,786 usd against 2,788, 
while tin rose to 13,975 usd against 13,905.

STOCKS: UK blue chips closed a touch lower, as Wall Street traded in the red amid weaker-than-expected factory 
data and after severe declines in Chinese stocks, with property sector losses. Utility firms will be in the spotlight this 
week, with four companies due to report final results between today and Thursday. Brokers expect United Utilities 
PLC to report a 17-18 pct rise in full-year pretax profit today. Focus will also remain on Royal Bank of Scotland as 
the bank announces its trading performance.
BONDS: European government bonds remained somewhat higher yesterday, US factory orders data came in 
weaker-than-expected. In the UK, gilts were mixed after a delayed open due to technical problems at the exchange 
yesterday morning.
The Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday, but until the risk of a surprise 
hike is out of the way, analysts said gilts will have a difficult time gaining any significant momentum.
FOREX: The euro gained from hawkish comments by European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet 
overnight, and from speculation that the ECB will raise its inflation forecasts.
METALS: Gold bounced back from earlier falls to hit a fresh two-week high of 672.12 usd, as investors continued to 
be cheered by news that the ECB does not plan further sales of the metal and with strength in crude prices helping 
underpin gains. Copper extended Friday's gains on news of a sharp fall in LME inventories. At 1345 BST (1245 
GMT), LME copper for three-month delivery was up at 7,498 usd a tonne against Friday's close of 7,450 usd. In 
other metals, nickel was up at 47,750 usd against 47,500, zinc was flat at 3,770 usd, aluminium edged down to 
2,786 usd against 2,788, while tin rose to 13,975 usd against 13,905. Oil prices reversed earlier losses and rose on

contracts for July delivery were up 45 cents at 69.52 usd a barrel.

STOCKS: Wall Street recovered from a mostly negative Monday, clawing into positive territory as investors tried to 
brush off an 8.3 pct slide in Chinese stocks triggered by the Chinese government's attempt to cool the country's 
market boom.
Meanwhile, the US Commerce Department reported orders to US factories were weaker than expected in April -- 
growing by 0.3 pct, and disappointing analyst expectations of a 0.7 pct rise, compared with a 3.1 pct jump in March.
Investors might find some information to trade with the release of the Institute of Supply Management's service 
sector index on Tuesday, but not much other information is expected.
FOREX: The US dollar was weakened by the lower-than-expected factory orders data.
The euro climbed to 1.3488 usd in late New York trade from 1.3443 Friday. The pound rose to 1.9904 usd from 
1.9821 while the dollar fell to 121.82 yen from 122.06 yen, even as China's main stock index plunged to its biggest 
one-day fall since a February drop that triggered a global market sell-off.
Thomson Financial Europe AM at a glance share guide: Stocks mixed, dollar weak
The market is watching economic data to glean a direction regarding interest rates. The Fed has maintained 
interest rates for several months now, while the European Central Bank is expected to raise rates. The Bank of 
England
is also expected to keep its rate unchanged when it meets Thursday. Higher interest rates can boost a currency by 
making investments denominated in it more attractive.
In other trading, the dollar bought 1.0588 cad, down from 1.0618 cad, and 1.2235 sfr, down from 1.2303.
BONDS: US Treasury prices rose on hopes the lower-than-expected economic data will mean an interest rate cut 
this year. Rate cuts are used to kickstart a flagging economy. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note 
fell to 4.93 pct from 4.96 pct late Friday.
OIL: Oil prices rose in New York despite a Nigerian militant group announcing a one-month cease-fire and a US 
gasoline pipe recommencing supply. A barrel of light sweet crude rose 1.13 usd to 66.21 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile
Exchange.
METALS: Gold prices rose in New York on the back of a weakening dollar, as this boosts the precious metal's 
appeal as an alternative investment. Gold for August rose 0.2 pct to 13.77 usd an ounce on the Nymex.

volatility there. Manila shares were weaker in the middle of the session as investors locked-in profits, 
taking a pause after the main index hit record highs in recent sessions and disregarding the sustained 
uptrend in important markets in East Asia this morning.
    BONDS: Japanese government bonds ended the morning session mixed because of uncertainty among 
investors about the outlook for interest rates here and in the US. Investors kept to the sidelines while
