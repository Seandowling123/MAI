A lobby group made up of the four biggest airline using Dublin Airport has disbanded, claiming that neither the 
regulator nor the Dublin Airport Authority had listened to them.
The Dublin Airport Consultation Committee was set up by Aer Arann, Aer Lingus, CityJet and Ryanair last 
December with the aim of lobbying to have airline charges cut or at least held steady in the face of declining 
passenger numbers.
A statement from the DACC said it had told the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the DAA that the 
committee now had "no reason or purpose to continue" following the CAR's final decision to allow an increase on 
airport charges at Dublin Airport.
It complained late last year that the chief executive of the State-owned Dublin Airport Authority, Declan Collier, has 
repeatedly "refused" to meet it to discuss the planned 41pc increase in passenger charges. "Mr Collier has refused 
to accept any of our invitations, yet has found the time in recent weeks to travel to Kuala Lumpur and Dubai, while 
also devoting time to his position on the board of AIB," Geoffrey O'Byrne White of Cityjet said. The DACC called for 
lower airport charges and the abolition of the tax on airport departures in order to increase air traffic.

Ryanair claims it has not ruled out launching budget flights to Cyprus from Ireland and the UK in spite of claims 
from tour operators that they had managed to block the budget airline from entering the market.
Reports in the travel trade press have suggested that tour operators have persuaded the Cyprus authorities not to 
offer the airline discounted airport fees, claiming that low-cost flights would threaten their own business to the 
island.
The operators' claims came after Ryanair confirmed it was launching flights from Belgium to Larnaca but made no 
announcement of its plans to fly from Ireland or the UK to Cyprus.
However, a Ryanair spokesman said: "Cyprus is a long sector market and we have only just started developing 
these routes. "We already fly to Greece from other European destinations, but not from the UK. "We don't comment 
on speculation but it will probably be next summer before we look at developing further into the long sector market."

A website that aims to cut business costs by replacing direct mail with online marketing has already signed up more 
than 500 companies, and is adding between 25 and 50 new clients a week.
Dublin-based company EasyDeals.ie, which classes itself as an ''online marketplace'', was set up earlier this year 
by entrepreneurs Des Martin and Andrew Mullaney.
The website allows companies to advertise deals and special offers online, with consumers then able to search for 
such deals by sector and locality. Martin said the website made it easier for companies to target relevant 
consumers with promotions, rather than adopting the more costly approach of blanket advertising in areas and 
dropping leaflets in doors.
In the last month, more than 20,000 consumers have visited the website.
''The amount of promotional material being delivered was a real waste," he said. ''Most of it was going straight in the 
bin. So it was not just an environmental waste, but also a waste from a business point of view."
EasyDeals provided a ''more targeted way to reach people'' at a fraction of the cost, said Martin. He added that 
research had shown many people now used the internet as their first port of call for finding goods and services.
''We see ourselves as a research tool," he said.
''We're a deals platform, not a directory. We offer a marketplace to businesses and an alternative promotional 
channel."
EasyDeals hopes to attract up to 2,500 business users to its site. So far, it has a number of big names among its 
500 customers, including Aldi, Ryanair, DID Electrical, Smyths Toystores and Elvery Sports. For now, most 
advertisers are using a free package, with a smaller number opting for EasyDeals' gold package.

At a cost of  50 per month, this ensures that advertisers get a more prominent location on the website.
Clients also receive a report from Easy Deals outlining the number of hits their advertisements receive.
Next month, the company will launch an application for mobile phones. This new service will allow consumers to log 
on and find the best deals in their location.
''It will know where you are, and you can then set the radius you want to search within and the types of services you 
require," Martin said.

A rescue bid for regional airline Aer Arann is being lined up by a syndicate of Irish high net worth individuals.
The syndicate includes a number of well-known businessmen, including Jerry Kennelly, the award-winning 
entrepreneur who sold his company, Stockbyte, for$135 million in 2006.
The members are all close to Padraig O'Ceidigh, the owner and chairman of Aer Arann. The airline sought court 
protection last week.
The consortium believes that O'Ceidigh remains essential to the company's future, and wants him to stay on as 
chairman.
To date, the Kennelly-led syndicate is one of three potential investment plans to rescue the airline.
Those involved in all three have been granted access to the company's books and financial records, and due 
diligence is ongoing.
The examiner, insolvency specialist Michael McAteer, will engage with all three parties over the coming days.
The syndicate believes the airline is viable if its debts can be restructured. It is prepared to inject significant working 
capital into the balance sheet.
O'Ceidigh is a former Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year, and is chairman of the judging panel at this year's 
event.
He has strong links with the alumni and former participants of the entrepreneur event.
Aer Arann last week sought the appointment of an examiner after accruing losses totalling  18.2 million since 2008.
Syndicate investment could keep Aer Arann flying
The company was hampered by the impact of the volcanic ash cloud earlier this year, and also by the loss of a 
number of Public Service Obligation (PSO) routes to rival airlines, including Ryanair.
Speculation was mounting last week that Ryanair might launch its own bid for its smaller rival to gain control of 
other PSO routes. However, it is understood that no move has been made yet.

Irish shares had a mixed start in Dublin this morning, with an early single digit rise in the ISEQ quickly turning into a 
slight fall.
Shares across Europe are nervous this morning as investors show continued concern about the pace of economic 
recovery after recent grim macroeconomic data.
The market is awaiting the second estimate of US GDP for the second quarter Federal Reserve Chairman Ben 
Bernanke, who is likely to signal his views in a speech later today about the uncertain prospects for the world's 
biggest economy.
The ISEQ index was down 5.0 points a short time ago at 2,656.74. Independent Newspapers shares rose 1.5c to 
68 after it reported a return to profits for the first half and said the upward trend was continuing in the second half. 
Irish Continental gained 7c to 1480 as its first half figures showed a jump in passengers during the ash cloud crisis. 
Banks were out of favour this morning, with Bank of Ireland down 1.5c to 75 and Irish Life and Permanent down 1c

News In Brief
## Goldman Sachs chief global economist Jim O'Neill has described Ireland's downgrade as "pretty insignificant".
"Germany could be entering a period of self-sustaining domestic demand," he said yesterday. "If that were true, it 
would be of major importance for the rest of Europe. Germany is a third of the euro area. Ireland is tiny, its 
downgrade is pretty insignificant." German business confidence unexpectedly rose to a three-year high yesterday, 
driven by a jump in retailer sentiment.
"It's been such a long time since the German consumer has been spending. If it were for real, it's going to turn out 
to be major." Mr O'Neill said. " - Irish Independent ## Forestry company Coillte has concluded an agreement for the 
development of one of Ireland's largest wind projects in Co Galway. The project, which is located on Coillte-owned 
lands in Cloosh Valley near Moycullen, will see Scottish and Southern Energy take a 45 pc stake along with State-
owned Coillte, while Canadian firm Finavera Renewables will retain the remaining 10 pc share. Exactly how much 
the project will cost to develop is not known, but it could reach between 150-200m euro. The first phase of the 
project includes 22 turbines that will generate about 50MW. The entire project will have a total capacity of 105MW 
once it is completed, which will meet the electricity needs of more than 60,000 homes. - RTE ## Anglo Irish Bank 
faces the possibility of recovering nothing on a 15m euro investment in a bond sold by a failed Icelandic bank due to 
a clerical error at the State-owned bank. Anglo failed to register a claim as a creditor of Kaupthing bank, which 
collapsed at the height of the financial crisis in October 2008, over a "process error". The nationalised bank is 
appealing in a bid to reinstate its claim as a creditor, arguing that the claims process was unclear. A small 
percentage of the original investment may be recovered by Anglo if the appeal is successful but most of the original 
sum has been lost due to Kaupthing's bankruptcy. Anglo has applied a book value of 600,000 euro to the bond. -

with a large number of claims outstanding. While the carrier has paid all ticket refunds, half of all expense claims for 
hotels and subsistence costs remain to be paid. Ryanair said it has prioritised the flight refunds but processing of 
expense claims will take until the end of the year. The airline says the volcanic ash disruption cost it 50m euro 
overall. The Commission for Aviation Regulation has said it is satisfied that all the Irish airlines are responding 
adequately in issuing refunds relating to the disruption. - RTE ## Thirty seven firms are closing down in the 
Republic ever day, an increase of 14pc on last year. This comes as figures show the value of court judgments for 
the recovery of unpaid debt hit 14m euro in the second quarter of this year, up 55pc on last year. According to ICC 
Information, the construction sector accounted for the largest number of court judgments filed - 4.6m euro. The 
difficulties in this sector were further highlighted with judgment totalling 1.1m euro in real estate and renting. 
Companies involved in business activities were the second highest offenders, accounting for 19pc of all judgments, 
totalling just under 3m euro. This is up 19pc on last year. Dublin-based companies accounted for the majority of 
judgments. - Irish Examiner ## The head of Glanbia yesterday refused to rule out a buy-back by the Co-op of its 
Dairy Ireland business. Group Managing Director John Moloney described the deal, which was voted down by the 
co-op shareholders last May, as "dormant". But he added that it was "a matter for the co-op and farmers to 
reawaken that debate if they think it's the appropriate thing to do". - Irish Independent ## Official figures show that 
factory gate prices - prices of goods before they reach consumers - fell by 0.6pc in July compared with June. This

overall. The Commission for Aviation Regulation has said it is satisfied that all the Irish airlines are responding 
adequately in issuing refunds relating to the disruption. - RTE ## Thirty seven firms are closing down in the 
Republic ever day, an increase of 14pc on last year. This comes as figures show the value of court judgments for 
the recovery of unpaid debt hit 14m euro in the second quarter of this year, up 55pc on last year. According to ICC 
Information, the construction sector accounted for the largest number of court judgments filed - 4.6m euro. The 
difficulties in this sector were further highlighted with judgment totalling 1.1m euro in real estate and renting. 
Companies involved in business activities were the second highest offenders, accounting for 19pc of all judgments, 
totalling just under 3m euro. This is up 19pc on last year. Dublin-based companies accounted for the majority of 
judgments. - Irish Examiner ## The head of Glanbia yesterday refused to rule out a buy-back by the Co-op of its 
Dairy Ireland business. Group Managing Director John Moloney described the deal, which was voted down by the 
co-op shareholders last May, as "dormant". But he added that it was "a matter for the co-op and farmers to 
reawaken that debate if they think it's the appropriate thing to do". - Irish Independent ## Official figures show that 
factory gate prices - prices of goods before they reach consumers - fell by 0.6pc in July compared with June. This 
resulted in an annual increase of 0.9pc in prices, according to the Central Statistics Office. The biggest fall in July 
came in prices of food products, which dropped 1.8pc in the month. Dairy product prices rose 0.3pc, however. 
Prices of energy products fell by 0.2pc in the month, with wholesale petrol prices down 0.6pc. But energy and petrol 
prices are up 7.3pc and 24.1pc respectively over 12 months. - Irish Independent

Aer Lingus gains from cost-cutting programme
Aer Lingus gains from cost-cutting programme

Aer Lingus narrowed its losses in the first half with the formerly state-owned carrier benefiting from lower operating 
expense, savings in its fuel bill and cost reductions resulting from an ambitious staff reorganisation programme.
Pre-tax losses for the six months to June 30 were EUR20.8m (£17m), a 74 per cent improvement on the same 
period last year when the deficit was EUR81.7m.
Revenues fell from EUR555m to EUR538m, largely as a result of the airline flying fewer routes to the US.
Operating costs fell 14 per cent, while the fuel bill was down 30 per cent. Staff costs were cut by 10 per cent, with 
employee numbers down 7 per cent. With a 25 per cent reduction in its long-haul capacity, Aer Lingus carried 11 
per cent fewer passengers overall. But with unit costs reduced, the yield per passenger - a measure of an airline's 
profitability - was up 8 per cent.
Christoph Mueller, chief executive, described the improvement in its long- haul operation as "an incredible 
upswing".
The Irish company had a gross cash position at end-June of more than EUR1bn, reflecting increased working 
capital as passengers make advance bookings. Mr Mueller expects the year-end cash position be at least 
EUR850m.
"This gives us a breathing space most other airlines don't have," he said.
The company, which is 29 per cent owned by low-cost carrier Ryanair, expects to do "no worse than break-even" in 
the current year but declined to provide guidance for 2011 due to market uncertainties.
The shares eased 2 cents to 91 cents in Dublin.
  FT Comment 
Aer Lingus gains from cost-cutting programme
The rationalisation of the long-haul offering was long overdue and better hedging should keep fuel costs lower, but 
ultimately profitability will depend on the company being able to press on with its cost-reduction programme. 
Without a lower cost base, the airline is not in a position to be able to offer prices that can compete with its peers. 
Even with its restructuring programme, Aer Lingus's costs will still be slightly higher than those of EasyJet and 
considerably higher than those of Ryan-air. The long-term survival of the airline, in which the Irish government 
retains a 25 per cent strategic stake, could still depend on factors outside the company's control. However, Mr 
Mueller has made a good start at putting the airline back on track towards profitability. If Aer Lingus achieves break-
even this year it will be the first time since 2007, but none of this recovery story is reflected in the company's 
shares. On an enterprise value/ebitda basis, the airline is trading at three times 2011 earnings, compared with five 
times for most flag carriers and more than seven times for the low-cost operators. Another measure that the stock 
looks underpriced is the market capitalisation of EUR480m, which compares with net cash at the period end of 
EUR401m.

RUNWAY INCURSION PROMPTS TAIPEI REVIEW
INCIDENT Taipei's Taoyuan International airport is reviewing air traffic control procedures and has suspended 
several controllers after a 15 July runway incursion in which miscommunication between the pilot of an Antonov 
Airlines An-124 freighter and controllers resulted in the aircraft entering the runway while a Singapore Airlines 
Airbus A330 was taking off. The aircraft were 1,100m (3,600ft) apart.
AIRSTAIR REDESIGN RECOMMENDED AFTER FALL
SAFETY UK air accident investigators have asked Boeing to add a removable barrier to the forward airstair on 
737s, following a July 2009 accident at London Stansted in which a three-year-old girl boarding a Ryanair 737-800 
fell through the space between the platform and the handrail of the jet's integrated airstair.
COMAC C919 FUSELAGE MANUFACTURE BEGINS
DEVELOPMENT Jiangxi Hongdu Aviation has begun work on the first forward and aft fuselage sections for the 
Comac C919 single-aisle airliner. Comac is aiming for first flight in 2014, with service entry scheduled for 2016.
snubbed EL AL TO FORGE NEW ALLIANCE
AIRLINES Israeli flag-carrier El Al is forming a new airline alliance with Russia's UTAir, Ukraine's AeroSvit and 
Armenian carrier Armavia after abandoning attempts to join one of the three main existing alliances. Israeli sources 
say there are hopes of 20 airlines joining the Eastern-Western alliance by the end of 2011.
MAS EXPECTS DELAYED A380 IN APRIL 2012
DELIVERIES Malaysia Airlines will receive its first Airbus A380 in April 2012, more than five years behind schedule. 
The carrier ordered six aircraft in 2003, but Airbus has pushed back delivery three times, making compensation for 
the setbacks.

Former EU commissioner Charlie McCreevy has joined the board of a new bank which aims to grab a 6 per cent 
slice of the British retail banking market. He joins heavy-hitters like Lord McFall who chaired the British Treasury 
Select Committee and Lloyds of London chairman Lord Levene, on the board of NBNK.
Shares in NBNK began trading in London last Friday after it raised stg£50 million in fresh equity. Lord Levene has 
teamed up with corporate governance specialist David Walker and they plan to buy up bank branches of other 
banks that are being sold off.
Invesco owns 29.9 per cent of the new venture, while Aviva Investors and F&C have taken 10 per cent stakes.
This is the second high-profile directorship taken by McCreevy since his retirement as EU Commissioner earlier this 
year.
He recently joined the board of Ryanair.
It is not clear at this stage how much he will receive in directors' fees for his role in NBNK, or what stake he may 
hold in the venture.
The company has said that it wants to reintroduce traditional banking to the British market, and build itself up by 
providing current accounts and savings products.

Irish shares fell to their lowest in more than a year today as markets around the world shudder at the possibility of a 
double dip recession in the US.
The ISEQ index closed 46.50 points down at 2,756.12, its lowest level since July of last year.
The market here has fallen every day in the past two weeks, bar one, with investors growing steadily more gloomy 
by the day.
US stocks also fell today as fears persisted that the economic US recovery has run out of steam, leaving the Dow 
off by 1pc in mid session. Anaemic labour market and regional manufacturing reports indicated the economy was 
slowing. "Basically growth is just not there," said one US analyst "Until this administration figures out how to get 
people hired, we are going to be seeing a lot of these big up days, big down days, and the market's going to be all 
over the place." Markets in Europe were also down, with the Dax index in Frankfurt off by 1.15pc, the CAC-40 in 
Paris slipping by 1.3pc and the FTSE 100 closing 0.3pc lower. Things have not been helped either by a slump in 
the euro, caused by a leading council member of the European Central Bank, Axel Weber, giving his backing to 
continued unlimited lending by the Frankfurt institution next year to banks around Europe. His backing is now seen 
as ensuring that the practice will go ahead. It will allow Irish banks to keep gorging funds from the ECB rather than 
having to go out and look for them on the open market. The fact that Weber, a noted hawk on laggard banks, 
should back the continued largesse, is seen as a negative commentary on the state of health of the banking system 
across Europe. You might have expected Irish bank shares to lift in Dublin, but you'd be wrong. AIB closed flat on 
81 as it waited a deadline today for the placing of bids from would-be buyers of its 70pc stake in the Bank Zachodni 
WBK of Poland. Bank of Ireland was also unchanged at 76, while Irish Life & Permanent actually dropped by 7c to 
148. Food group Glanbia edged 1c higher to 332. It has been rising in recent times, largely on an upturn in the 
fortunes of the Irish dairy sector, where it is heavily involved. Davy analyst Cathal Kenny said that the group's 
ISEQ dives through 2,800 to a 13 mth low; ISEQ Tumbles
results, due next week, are likely to display a very strong performance, driven primarily by its dairy operations in 
Ireland. A fall in jet kerosene prices was also identified yesterday Bloxham Stockbrokers as potentially good news 
for both Ryanair and Aer Lingus. The broker said both airlines were hedged on the fuel up to early 2011 , but the fall 
in price should help them beyond that. Neither of the airlines' shares responded, however, with investors sitting on 
their hands. Aer Lingus was unchanged on 93, while Ryanair dropped by 2c to 380. Some of the Dublin market's 
biggest names took heavy hits, with packaging group Smurfit Kappa down 24c to 719, building materials supplier 
CRH off by 46c to 1389 and distribution group DCC dropping by 21c to 1923.

off by 1pc in mid session. Anaemic labour market and regional manufacturing reports indicated the economy was 
slowing. "Basically growth is just not there," said one US analyst "Until this administration figures out how to get 
people hired, we are going to be seeing a lot of these big up days, big down days, and the market's going to be all 
over the place." Markets in Europe were also down, with the Dax index in Frankfurt off by 1.15pc, the CAC-40 in 
Paris slipping by 1.3pc and the FTSE 100 closing 0.3pc lower. Things have not been helped either by a slump in 
the euro, caused by a leading council member of the European Central Bank, Axel Weber, giving his backing to 
continued unlimited lending by the Frankfurt institution next year to banks around Europe. His backing is now seen 
as ensuring that the practice will go ahead. It will allow Irish banks to keep gorging funds from the ECB rather than 
having to go out and look for them on the open market. The fact that Weber, a noted hawk on laggard banks, 
should back the continued largesse, is seen as a negative commentary on the state of health of the banking system 
across Europe. You might have expected Irish bank shares to lift in Dublin, but you'd be wrong. AIB closed flat on 
81 as it waited a deadline today for the placing of bids from would-be buyers of its 70pc stake in the Bank Zachodni 
WBK of Poland. Bank of Ireland was also unchanged at 76, while Irish Life & Permanent actually dropped by 7c to 
148. Food group Glanbia edged 1c higher to 332. It has been rising in recent times, largely on an upturn in the 
fortunes of the Irish dairy sector, where it is heavily involved. Davy analyst Cathal Kenny said that the group's

results, due next week, are likely to display a very strong performance, driven primarily by its dairy operations in 
Ireland. A fall in jet kerosene prices was also identified yesterday Bloxham Stockbrokers as potentially good news 
for both Ryanair and Aer Lingus. The broker said both airlines were hedged on the fuel up to early 2011 , but the fall 
in price should help them beyond that. Neither of the airlines' shares responded, however, with investors sitting on 
their hands. Aer Lingus was unchanged on 93, while Ryanair dropped by 2c to 380. Some of the Dublin market's

Irish shares fell to their lowest in more than a year today as markets around the world shudder at the possibility of a 
double dip recession in the US.
The ISEQ index closed 46.50 points down at 2,756.12, its lowest level since July of last year.
The market here has fallen every day in the past two weeks, bar one, with investors growing steadily more gloomy 
by the day.
US stocks also fell today as fears persisted that the economic US recovery has run out of steam, leaving the Dow 
off by 1pc in mid session. Anaemic labour market and regional manufacturing reports indicated the economy was

Irish shares have gone south again this morning, with the ISEQ index dropping below the 2,800 level.
The index was 15.90 points lower a short time ago at 2,786.72.
Irish shares have now fallen every day bar one in the past two weeks.
Their latest fall follows a 1.39pc drop in the Dow last night on poor employment and business data which suggested 
that the US recovery has stalled. Shares elsewhere in Europe this morning have been mixed. The FTSE 100 in

Ireland's largest company led a parade of big names lower on the Dublin market today as the stock market ran out 
of puff.
CRH shares slipped by 5c to 1506 as the market resumed a downward path.
It has been downward all the way on the local market for a week and a half now, with only a brief respite yesterday.
That was when the money market loaned Ireland 1.5bn euro in an apparent display of confidence in the country's 
prospects. Investors were displaying no such positive instincts today as the ISEQ resumed its listless southward 
drift. The index ended the day at a languid 3.13 points lower to 2,854.83, bringing its fall since the start of last week 
to 129. A lack of any positive news domestically was compounded by negative vibes from global markets. US 
stocks suffered falls today on tepid corporate earnings that gave investors little reason to buy. That made things 
even stickier for building materials CRH, which makes half of its profits in the United States. Analysts said it was 
hurt by data showing that US housing starts were weaker than expected. Data for the sector also showed that 
prices for construction materials were weak in July , with cement languishing nearly 7pc on a year ago. On top of 
that architecture billings are still contracting. Shares in Independent News & Media were down 2c to 68 after 
disappointing news from its 32pc owned Australian arm APN. The antipodean newspaper, radio and outdoor 
advertising operation said net profit for the six months to June 30, was Aus Dlr 38.98m, compared with Aus Dlr 
37.16m in the prior corresponding period. However, revenue was down 0.2pc at Aus Dlr 509.4m, even though a 
recovery in revenue had accelerated in the second quarter. Davy Stockbrokers analyst Simon McGrotty said that, of 
its three divisions, outdoor and broadcasting came in behind estimates, while publishing was ahead. "Athough 
these numbers weree disappointing," he said, " the outlook statement was positive and rthere are clear signs that a 
recovery is taking place in APN's key markets." Ryanair was flat on 382 after the collapse of three UK holiday firms 
in recent days, despite an upbeat note on the matter from Bloxham Stockbrokers. Bloxhams said: "Darwinism 
ISEQ ends 3.13 points lower at 2,854.83; ISEQ Lower
continues to course through the air travel market, with the fittest getting stronger. Easyjet and Ryanair will both 
exploit these collapses." Origin Enterprises dipped by 2c to 265, despite news that one of its main products - 
fishmeal - has risen in price by 79pc in dollar terms since the start of the year. Origin has a half share in Europe's 
largest fishmeal operation. Banks did poorly across Europe today, weighing particularly on the London market, as 
nagging doubts persisted about the global economic recovery. Banks did poorly in Dublin as well, with AIB down by 
1c to 84 and Bank of Ireland down similarly to 80. Irish Life and Permanent was off by 2c to 166. There were, 
despite everything, some risers in the market yesterday. Drug maker Elan gained 4c to 380, with bakery group 
Aryzta up by 19c to 3219 and distribution group DCC also ahead by 7c to 1945.

Ireland's two big banks took another shower on the stock market this morning on continuing worries about funding.
In the wake of rising costs last week for government borrowing, and continued uncertainty about the state

Ireland's two big banks took another shower on the stock market this morning on continuing worries about funding.
In the wake of rising costs last week for government borrowing, and continued uncertainty about the state 
guarantee for banks after September, both fell heavily in early trade.
AIB was down 4c, or almost 5pc, to 80, while Bank of Ireland was off by 5c, or 6pc, to 74.
Irish Life and Permanent was up by 2c to 171. The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 14.20 points a short time 
ago at 2,810.44. Away from the financials, CRH was down 4c to 1473, with DCC down 1c to 1905. McInerney was 
down 1c to 4 after a weekend report that said it may seek examinership. Ryanair is up 2c at 372 and bakery group 
Aryzta has gained 24c to 3175.

In January, Panda Waste announced plans to invest EUR 12 million in Ireland's first mechanical biological 
treatment (MBT) plant at its headquarters in Co. Meath.
Due for completion before the end of the year, the company said that the 170,000 square foot facility would create 
40 jobs, converting 250,000 tonnes of organic household waste into a high-grade compost for land-spreading.
The company also opened a new EUR 9 million refuse derived fuel (RDF) facility to recover high-calorific materials - 
including plastic, paper and cardboard - from black bin household waste, converting it into a coal substitute for 
cement production.
Panda Waste handles domestic and commercial waste at three centres, one in Meath and two in Dublin. It is 
Ireland's largest recycler of paper, cardboard and timber.
In other news, Monex, a multi-currency and card processing company based in Kerry, agreed a deal with car rental 
brand Hertz.
With an estimated value of EUR 4.5 million, the three-year agreement was for the provision of multi-currency 
treasury management software to Hertz operations in Europe.
Using Monex's Customer Preferred Currency Conversion (CPCC) software, the deal has allowed Hertz customers 
to convert foreign transactions in all locations into the currency normally used on their credit card.
Established in 1997, Monex has offices in Ireland and overseas in Britain, America, Australia, Hong Kong, 
Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore. It has licensing agreements in place with Dublin Airport Authority and Ryanair.
Cork firm Luxcel Biosciences secured funding of EUR 2.5 million as part of a strategic partnership with US firm 
Mocon Inc.
REVIEW 2010: Panda starts year with multi-million euro deals
Luxcel said it would use the funding from Mocon, a developer of detection and measurement tools for the food and 
pharmaceutical industries, to start a new R&D programme, supported by Enterprise Ireland, and to launch test 
products for the food safety and packaging industries.
Luxcel was founded in 2002 as a spin-out of University College Cork, to commercialise research into 
phosphorescence-based sensor development and its applications for biological testing.
The company's sensors enable rapid, high-throughput screening and detection of bacterial contamination of food 
samples and non-invasive analysis of gas in food, beverage and pharmaceutical packaging.
In the same month, another Cork firm, McGill Environmental, announced it had secured investment of EUR 920,000 
from the 2008 Davy BES Fund.
Established in 1997, McGill Environmental Systems (Ireland) is an independent subsidiary of US company McGill 
Environmental Systems group. It has operations in Castletownroche and Glenville in Cork, and Cappoquin, Co 
Waterford. It processes non-hazardous biodegradable material to produce compost for the agricultural, landscaping 
and peat processing markets.
The company secured Davy BES funding of EUR 465,000 in 2003.

Maturity doesn't always bring stability. For airlines the opposite is true: maturity means high fixed costs and lease 
payments, making them both operationally and financially geared. As a result, airlines are intensely sensitive to the 
economic cycle: shares in British Airways, Air France-KLM, Continental and Delta swing more than underlying 
markets (their betas, a measure of relative volatility, range from 1.1 and 1.9, where the market is always 1.0). The 
stock market path of fast-growing budget carriers Ryanair and EasyJet is smoother (betas of 0.5 or so).
Managing a volatile business is difficult, but in the past airlines have hardly made life easier for themselves. They 
rushed aircraft back into the air whenever economic conditions improved, swamping demand and pushing down 
ticket prices. News that Cathay Pacific, British Airways and others are beginning to wheel 747s out of desert 
storage raises the fear that they making the same mistake again.
Last year, airlines cut capacity back to 2007 levels; now it is 10 to 15 per cent higher, according to consultancy 
Ctaira. Yet much of that is down to a big bet by Middle Eastern airlines. North American airlines, once the worst 
offenders, have hardly expanded capacity at all this year, even though traffic is up 6 per cent. The result is fuller 
aircraft (87 per cent in June compared with an industry average of 80 per cent) and higher ticket prices.
So far, not too extreme. But in a few months time, airlines will have to decide on capacity for summer 2011. They 
will be tempted to keep adding aircraft. After all, demand is already back at pre-recession levels and holding aircraft 
in storage is nothing but a cost. They will also fret about losing market share to bolder rivals. But with economic 
recovery looking more fragile than ever, excessive enthusiasm should be left to the immature.

Wall Street Posts Steep Losses Amid Prospect Of Slowing Economy

Body
(RTTNews) - Stocks fell by substantial margins on Wednesday, as concerns about a waning economic recovery 
prompted a significant flight to safety in the markets. With the sell-off, the major averages fell to their worst levels in 
three weeks, posting losses across the board for the second straight session.
The Dow plummeted 265.42 points or 2.5 percent to 10,378.83, the Nasdaq plunged 68.54 points or 3 percent to 
2,208.63 and the S&P 500 tumbled 31.59 points or 2.8 percent to 1,089.47.
The weakness in the markets came as traders reacted to Tuesday's commentary from the Federal Reserve, which 
said that the gears driving the fragile economic recovery are slowing, prompting concerns of a double dip recession.
The Fed said in a statement that it sees "more modest" economic growth in the near-term than previously expected 
and symbolized its lack of confidence in the recovery by saying that it would reinvest funds from maturing 
mortgage-backed securities into U.S. treasury bonds.
On the economic front today, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit for June unexpectedly 
widened to reach its highest level in well over a year.
The report showed that the trade deficit widened to $49.9 billion in June from a revised $42.0 billion in May. The 
wider deficit came as a surprise to economists, who had expected the deficit to narrow to $42.2 billion from the 
$42.3 billion originally reported for the previous month.
In other economic news, the Treasury Department reported its July deficit at $165.0 billion compared to a shortfall 
of $180.7 billion in the same month last year. The figure was slightly narrower than the forecast for a deficit of 
$169.0 billion.
With earnings season winding down, Macy's, Inc. (M) reported second-quarter net income and revenues that firmly 
topped estimates.
Steel, transportation, banking and semiconductor stocks all posted steep losses on the day, reflective of the 
concern regarding a continued economic rebound. The NYSE Arca Steel Index fell by 5 percent to a three-week 
closing low.
Wall Street Posts Steep Losses Amid Prospect Of Slowing Economy
In the transportation sector, airline stocks saw heavy selling, culminating in a 4.5 percent retreat by the NYSE Arca 
Airline Index. Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) was one of the sector's worst performers, sinking by 7.3 percent to a 
five-week closing low.
Considerable weakness was also visible among health insurance, defense, housing and oil service stocks, further 
evident of the day's broad-based selling pressure.
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region ended on the downside Wednesday. Hong Kong's 
Hang Seng Index slid by 0.8 percent, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped by 2.7 percent.
The major European markets also closed sharply lower. The French CAC 40 Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index 
fell by 2.7 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, while the German DAX Index slid by 2.1 percent.
In the bond markets, treasuries ended notably higher amid the weakness on Wall Street. Subsequently, the yield on 
the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, closed at 2.685 percent, posting a loss of 9.6 basis 
points.
Thursday, data on jobless claims is likely to draw the most attention, while the markets will also be presented with 
the latest data on import and export prices.

"If the cabinet continues to maintain a low profile on the issue, we'll forward the matter to the European 
Commission," the airline said.
It insisted that this was an example of "unfair competition" on the local market.
Ryanair is about to launch services from Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest city, to London Stansted. The new route 
will bring Ryanair's annual traffic at Plovdiv to about 30,000 passengers. "The new route will ensure that Plovdiv 
and its regional tourism will develop further and even more jobs will be created both in the city and in the region,"

Irish shares bounced back this morning from their losses of Friday, with banks sharing the improved mood.
The recovery on the Irish market matched gains abroad as global investors get over Friday's poor US jobs data.
Analysts say growing speculation the US Federal Reserve will have to buy bonds sooner rather than later to bolster 
the sagging US economy is also lending support to markets.
A short time ago the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 29.12 points at 2,963.05. The two big Irish banks have risen 
modestly this morning, with AIB up 1c to 93 and Bank of Ireland lifting by 2c to 85. Irish Life and Permanent is flat 
on 71. Away from the financials, CRH is ahead by 33c to 1632, with Elan up 15c to 398 and DCC adding 5c to 
1936. Ryanair has lifted by 4c to 398, with Smurfit Kappa up similarly to 807.

Computer group Dell has secured a  470,000 Ryanair deal to implement a storage solution at the airline's Dublin 
based IT headquarters.
Under the terms of the contract, Dell upgraded Ryanair's data centre infrastructure to manage all internal IT 
requirements.
A new 10GbE EqualLogic storage solution increased data processing capacity across Ryanair operations in 26 
countries, ensuring reduced maintenance and downtime and constant access to e-mail and other critical 
applications.
The solution is scalable, with capacity to handle the future growth needs of the 7,000strong company.
Dell has also posted a dedicated service delivery manager at Ryanair's IT headquarters in Cherrywood, who will 
work with the airline to implement a three-to-five-year strategic services plan in tandem with Dell's European 
Command Centre in Limerick.
''As Ryanair continues to grow, there are increasing demands on the data centre.
We needed a solution that would give us the foundation to build a virtualised environment to allow the company to 
scale for future expansion," said Eric Neville, chief information officer of Ryanair.
''Of critical importance is that the virtualised and simplified storage solution provided by Dell has dramatically 
reduced the time required to look after the system, freeing the IT team to focus on delivering more value to the 
business."

You could be forgiven for thinking that there are two RTEs in existence.
One is the RTE that launched a new television season schedule last week, offering increased programming output 
in spite of the cutbacks of the past 18 months.
That's the same RTE that showed steady figures in the quarterly radio audience survey a week earlier, after a 
couple of year s of growth.
Crucially, it's the RTE that has returned 2009 financials showing that a looming revenue falloff of almost  
70millionversus budget in that year was turned around to just  16.5 million in operational deficit. Unwelcome red ink, 
but quite a turnaround.
This is the RTE that knows its business and its cost base - and also knows its audience.
The other RTE is a pantomime version, a kind of Ballymagash parody, that surfaces from time to time in 
commentaries that prefer to hold onto assumptions a generation old about what happens in Donnybrook.
This version was alive and well in last week's column by Vincent Browne in this newspaper. It contrasts starkly with 
the steady reportage offered by other journalists in these pages, and it bore little resemblance to the actuality of 
RTE as it now is.
The core of Vincent's argument concerned RTE's financial management. He wrote:
''Costs at RTE are massive, and have been allowed to be massive by a culture of indulgence, cosseted due to 
decades of immunity from the vicissitudes of the real world."
Vincent adduced no evidence to support these claims.
Browne's image of RTE 'a Ballymagash parody'
The fact is that RTE has undergone an internal revolution in financial governance from 2001, since the appointment 
as chief financial officer of former Ryanair chief executive Conor Hayes during the then RTE chairmanship of former 
Smurfit group president Paddy Wright.
The experience of change within RTE and for business suppliers has been palpable.
It enabled RTE to channel the increased revenues of 2003-2008 into greatly expanded programmes output for the 
Irish public; to invest tens of millions in new independent production with lean and efficient processes; to cope with 
the redirection of 7 per cent of the licence fee to a fund available to other broadcasters (including TV3); and all the 
while meeting its obligation to invest a planned  70 million for the building of the national Digital Terrestrial 
Television infrastructure.
Crucially, it also positioned RTE to cope with the brutal downturn in commercial revenues which confronted all 
media operations from 2008.
In RTE's case, 2009 brought the looming shortfall referred to above. The pulling of over  50million out of the net 
operating cost base in 2009 is testament to flexibility, clarity in management and, above all, to the willingness of 
staff to respond to change in the outside world.
Staff took pay cuts of up to 12.5p er cent and the cancellation of any bonuses. Others took early retirement to 
reduce the payroll. Non personnel-related cutbacks were even more extensive.
RTE was the first public body to volunteer such change. It did so in a strategic and targeted way: viewers and 
listeners will have experienced minimal impact.
That this financial rigour was both full and directed toward the core programming services was characteristic of the 
direction of RTE during the term as director general of Cathal Goan, a former producer and editor in radio and 
television.
Overall, the rapid change at Donnybrook in the past 18 months could hardly contrast more starkly with Vincent's 
characterisation of the organisation and its people as insulated from reality.
How could RTE or its staff be insulated?
In governance terms, there has been another revolution: an independent regulator for the first time; around 100 
itemised public commitments to service delivery, efficiency and change specified to government and reported on 
annually as a condition of licence fee funding; and a new RTE board with members chosen, for the first time, 
through public competition.
In market terms, RTE is competed against now by more than 30 radio stations and three other national TV 
broadcasters.
These are joined by all of the British terrestrials and a host of satellite channels which, together, win approximately 
40 per cent of the peak time viewing audience.
It all makes Ireland one of the most competitive broadcast territories in Europe.
Yet RTE's audience loyalty holds up.
Vincent's assertions concerning the published fees of RTE's top presenters are simply that: assertions unsupported 
by analysis.
It's fair to conclude, as Cathal Goan stated last year, that some fees became excessive.
But any fair analysis would require real research: into the unpublished presenter fees paid by commercial 
broadcasters; into how many non-RTE presenters might figure in a top ten list if all fees were published (not just 
Browne's image of RTE 'a Ballymagash parody'
RTE's); into the offers made by commercial broadcasters to RTE presenters (such as company profit share, that 
RTE can never match); into the judgement calls RTE must make around developing talent over years and retaining 
it in the face of competitive bids.
At the centre of Vincent's column was a castigation of the RTE of the 1980s for allowing a political cabal to gain 
critical influence for a period within RTE's journalism. He wrote about the politics of that time, including RTE's, with 
distinction.
The uncomfortable feeling is that it's the last time he really looked at what happens in Donnybrook.
In his column, he suggested that ''tired assumptions are inimical to good journalism.
Among all the points he offered, that one surely is true. Kevin Dawson is head of corporate communications at RTE

SWITZERLAND: We've had pop-up shops, restaurants and hotels, but next month the Swiss are going one better - 
with the world's first pop-up golf course. Lasting just a month, from September 10, the 18-hole course will be 
located in the mountains above the village of Adelboden. At an altitude of more than 2,000 metres, it will be 
Europe's highest course, with plenty to challenge even the best golfers: streams, rocks, rapidly changing weather 
conditions and considerable height differences between tee and green. There will also be a driving range and a 
clubhouse in a cosy mountain cabin. www.golfmountain.ch 
 USA: Florida-based Spirit Airlines seems intent on trumping Ireland's Ryanair in the race to introduce as many 
ancillary charges as possible. Last weekend it began charging passengers for carry-on, as well as checked 
luggage, in what is believed to be an aviation first. Passengers can still take a purse or small bag onboard for free, 
but a standard-sized carry-on bag now costs between $20 and $45 per flight. The airline says the charge will help 
planes leave on time, and is part of its "Ultra Low Cost Carrier" approach. www.spiritair.com  UK: Fergus 
Henderson, chef and owner of St John restaurant in London, is opening a hotel in October. The 15-room property, 
just off Leicester Square, will have rates starting at £200. Aesthetics seem set to echo those of his restaurant. 
Henderson, a trained architect, describes the white-washed, wood-panelled rooms as "dour but comfortable . . . you 
won't see any tassels on things". The St John Hotel will also have a restaurant open until 2am.

The ISEQ made steady progress this morning after Wednesday's decline as markets await the ECB president, Jean 
Claude Trichet's, interest rate decision and comments on the economy.
By 12:30, the index had risen by 27.66 points to 2,991.00.
Investors' appetite for risky assets such as stocks has improved in the wake of reassuring stress tests on the 
banking sector, news that a planned reform of the sector would be scaled down, and solid corporate results across 
the board. As expected, the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday, while investors awaited 
the ECB's rate decision and comments from ECB President Jean-CLaude Trichet. The central bank is expected to 
leave interest rates at a record low 1.0 percent and to reaffirm that key ECB policy rates remain "appropriate", 
cementing economists' view that the bank will keep rates on hold well into next year. But investors' main focus will 
be on Trichet's news conference, to see whether the ECB sees the euro zone economic recovery maintaining its 
recent strong pace.
Banks failed to make any real rebound after yesterday's rout and weaker than expected half year results from AIB. 
Shares in AIB inched up just 1c to E0.94, Bank of Ireland rose 2c to E0.87 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 4c 
to E1.86. According to Davy Research, AIB's interim results and presentation served two key purposes: to highlight 
the pressure facing the current business and to map out how the smaller group will look going forward. "Looking at 
the target 2013 metrics suggests to us that management believes that a pre-tax profit of E1bn is achievable in 
2013. This is similar to the profit achieved in 2008 but is well below equivalent peak profits of E2.4bn in 2007," said 
analyst, Stephen Lyons. Ladbrokes has announced first half results. The numbers are very strong with core profits, 
pre-telephone high-rollers, coming in at £103.6m. Along with strong numbers, the group has announced 
management changes with a new head of UK retail, a new role encompassing head of strategy, international 
expansion and digital channels, as well as a strengthening of the board with the appointment of a former CEO and

chairman of Coral as senior non-executive director. The group has also announced the re-commencement of a 
dividend. Shares in Ireland's Paddy Power fell 20c to E27.60. Ryanair released traffic figures for the month of July, 
with passenger numbers up 13pc annually to a record 7.6m (bang in line with Goodbody's estimate of 13pc growth 
for the second quarter). Load factors were down one percentage point to 88pc, implying capacity growth of 14pc, 
while the rolling 12-month load factor remains at 82pc. Shares in Ryanair gained 5c to E4.00.

the index rose 4.21points to 2,967.55.
Investors' appetite for risky assets such as stocks has improved in the wake of reassuring stress tests on the

economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in the economic activity in the second quarter 
of 2010 and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected," Trichet told a news conference after 
the ECB kept its main interest rate on hold at 1pc. "Looking further ahead ... we continue to expect the euro area

Banks failed to make any real rebound after yesterday's rout and weaker than expected half year results from AIB.

The ISEQ made steady progress today after Wednesday's decline ahead of the ECB president, Jean Claude 
Trichet's, interest rate decision but sold off again in the afternoon.
the index rose 4.21points to 2,967.55.
Investors' appetite for risky assets such as stocks has improved in the wake of reassuring stress tests on the 
banking sector, news that a planned reform of the sector would be scaled down, and solid corporate results across 
the board. Third quarter euro zone economic data has been surprisingly strong so far but the ECB still expects the 
bloc's economic recovery to be moderate and uneven, President Jean-Claude Trichet said today. "The available 
economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in the economic activity in the second quarter 
of 2010 and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected," Trichet told a news conference after 
the ECB kept its main interest rate on hold at 1pc. "Looking further ahead ... we continue to expect the euro area 
economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace in an environment of uncertainty," he said.
Banks failed to make any real rebound after yesterday's rout and weaker than expected half year results from AIB. 
Shares in AIB inched up just 1c to E0.94, Bank of Ireland rose 3c to E0.87 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 2c 
to E1.84. According to Davy Research, AIB's interim results and presentation served two key purposes: to highlight 
the pressure facing the current business and to map out how the smaller group will look going forward. "Looking at 
the target 2013 metrics suggests to us that management believes that a pre-tax profit of E1bn is achievable in 
2013. This is similar to the profit achieved in 2008 but is well below equivalent peak profits of E2.4bn in 2007," said 
analyst, Stephen Lyons. Ladbrokes has announced first half results. The numbers are very strong with core profits, 
pre-telephone high-rollers, coming in at £103.6m. Along with strong numbers, the group has announced 
management changes with a new head of UK retail, a new role encompassing head of strategy, international 
expansion and digital channels, as well as a strengthening of the board with the appointment of a former CEO and

chairman of Coral as senior non-executive director. The group has also announced the re-commencement of a 
dividend. Shares in Ireland's Paddy Power rose 3c to E27.83. Ryanair released traffic figures for the month of July, 
with passenger numbers up 13pc annually to a record 7.6m (bang in line with Goodbody's estimate of 13pc growth 
for the second quarter). Load factors were down one percentage point to 88pc, implying capacity growth of 14pc, 
while the rolling 12-month load factor remains at 82pc. Shares in Ryanair was flat at E3.95. Vicat (a French based 
building materials company with operations in 11 countries) reported first half EBITD of E231m (+1pc annually), 
which was broadly in line with consensus. In terms of CRH, Vicat's comments on Switzerland and Turkey are of 
interest. Sales in Switzerland (10pc of group profits and CRH's second largest European exposure) were up almost 
10pc in the first half on the back of good demand for underground construction projects. CRH shares fell by 3c to 
E16.30.

Highlight: News analysis
Tim Johnston looks at how Asia's carriers are lifting their regional appeal with new routes
Body
State-owned Thai Airways International's move to set up a budget airline with Tiger Airways is likely to give 
momentum to moves towards a more open regional airline architecture, but it will also fuel concerns about 
overcapacity.
"Until now, the Thai government has been highly protective of its flag carrier and has been threatening to drag the 
chain on the Asean multilateral timetable for moving towards open skies for south-east Asian airlines," the Sydney-
based Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation said yesterday.
"This position could now soften, as high-cost Thai Airways will have the opportunity to meet competition on a more 
equal footing." The two carriers said the marriage was prompted by expanding opportunities in intra-regional 
tourism, a market that south-east Asia and Thailand in particular has failed to exploit.
"Bangkok is a key gateway to the whole of south- east Asia and from its base at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thai Tiger 
will be well positioned to also serve destinations in northern Asia and the Indian sub-continent," said Tony Davis, 
the chief executive of Tiger.
It is a market that Thai has been unable to tap into on its own.
Over the past seven years, tourist arrivals from eastern Asian countries into Thailand, the region's most popular 
leisure destination, have fallen from just over 60 per cent of all arrivals to just over 50 per cent. In absolute terms 
the number of Chinese arrivals in Thailand has shrunk in recent years. Many of the increasing number of Chinese 
tourists appear to be heading to Hong Kong and Taiwan. A viable low-cost option could help reverse the trend.
There is no shortage of no-frills airlines in Asia and the Pacific. Tiger, which raised S$277m (US$205m) in an IPO 
this year and counts the Ryan family - of Ryanair fame - and Singapore Airlines among its shareholders, is the 
smallest of the flock. Malaysia's Air-Asia, which was among the first of the low-cost carriers to recognise the value 
Low-cost alliance opens doors for fresh cross-border business
of cross-border joint ventures, has a fleet of 82 aircraft; Jetstar, along with its joint ventures Singapore-based 
Jetstar Asia and Vietnam-based Jetstar Pacific has 68, and Tiger just 19.
But all three have ambitious expansion programmes. According to Capa, AirAsia has at least 165 planes on order, 
Jetstar 66 and Tiger 52. And that has led some people to worry about overcapacity.
"In essence Asia is a growing market because of the high rate of GDP growth, but you have some of the 
established carriers responding to the challenge," said Chris Tarry, a veteran observer of the airline industry.
Mr Tarry says the law of diminishing returns is likely to cut in as the supply of profitable new routes starts to 
diminish and both low-cost and legacy airlines are forced to compete on established routes.
"The low-cost airlines are growth airlines and as growth slows, they are likely to fall from favour," he said.

Volcanic ash and strikes take their toll on BA
Volcanic ash and strikes take their toll on BA

Body
British Airways suffered another quarter of losses as it was hit by cabin crew strikes and the volcanic ash cloud that 
closed large parts of European airspace for six days in April.
But the flag carrier showed strong growth in profit margins as more business-class seats were filled.
After losing almost £1bn in the past two years, the airline said pre-tax losses for the three months to the end of June 
had been £164m. Losses in the same period of 2009 were £148m. Other airlines were affected by the ash cloud, 
with Ryanair and EasyJet both reporting related losses in the tens of millions of pounds, but only BA had to cope 
with protracted strikes by flight crew. The impact of the disruptions came to £250m in the quarter - in line with the 
company's previous estimates.
New talks will take place next week between BA and the Unite union in the long-running dispute over cabin crew 
staffing and pay. BA's "final offer" was rejected by the union in July, but Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said 
yesterday that low turnout at the vote "gives us reason to be optimistic that we've got the basis of a settlement".
Putting aside the ash cloud and industrial action, Mr Walsh said BA's underlying financial performance had 
improved. Profit margins rose 13.5 per cent in the quarter from the same period last year, beating some analysts' 
forecasts.
"Maybe yields are recovering slightly ahead of where we thought they would, but not a lot," Mr Walsh said. He 
expects smaller increases later in the year, as airlines start adding routes back to their schedules.
BA said the UK pensions regulator had approved its plan to cut its pension deficit. The move should help ease the 
way for its merger with Spanish carrier Iberia next year. Shares in BA rose 1.7 per cent to 219.6p.
  FT Comment 
If you've got appetite for risk, airlines - hostage to both freak events such as volcanic eruptions and more 
predictable economic downturns - are not a bad place to start. Yet BA is looking a less risky prospect these days. 
The wind seems to have gone out of the union's sails, with less than half of Unite members voting on 
Volcanic ash and strikes take their toll on BA
management's latest offer. In the meantime, the cabin crew staffing changes have taken effect, saving the company 
£17m in the first quarter, annualised to almost £70m.
That could make the difference between a small profit and a small loss in 2011. Analysts put BA's year-end 
enterprise value to ebitda anywhere from 4 to 6 and higher. Compared with Air France's EV/ebitda of 6.9, that 
suggests BA might be undervalued.

Burberry non-executive director Stephanie George announced a trade that more than doubled her holding in the 
fashion retailer on Tuesday. Shares in company have continued to sparkle over the last 30 months and are up by 
more than 100 per cent since she first bought them a year ago. The fact that George joined the board in 2006 but 
then waited three years before executing her maiden trade serves to underpin her trading pedigree - Burberry's 
shares halved in first three years of her tenure while she sat on the sidelines with no holding. A publisher by trade, 
the New Yorker is an executive at Time Inc and cut her teeth at In Style magazine.
In spite of making an apparently ill-timed trade in Mouchel Group a month ago, chief executive Richard Cuthbert 
underlined his belief that the shares are undervalued by investing a further £48,000 last Friday. He has spent eight 
years at the public-sector consulting firm, but his June trade was his first on the open market, and came after the 
shares had halved from 260p at the start of the year. Mouchel shares were already down 15 per cent in the year to 
May, and the declines gathered pace after the general election - as the scale of spending cutbacks under the 
coalition government became clear. Although the government has indicated that it expects to pay less to the public 
sector, it is not so unequivocal about reducing the work it expects in return. So Mouchel's shares briefly hit an all-
time low, dipping below 100p. But they recovered thanks to Cuthbert's trade, which was followed by buying from 
chairman Bo Lerenius. The Swede invested for the third time in his 18 months on the board, having recently bought 
into Thomas Cook.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is not noted for equivocation and, this week, he released bullish results that cheered 
the City. In spite of weaker profits due to volcanic ash disruption, the company's forecasts for the year were better 
than analysts expected. So the shares threatened to eclipse their April high at the start of the week - but were hit on 
Thursday by the announcement that O'Leary had sold 8 per cent of his stake. This disposal netted him more than 
£5m, including a small tranche of options. It was about the same scale as his disposal a year ago, when the share 
price was 4 per cent lower. Most analysts remained ambivalent - but the timing was commented on by one, who 
reminded investors that Ryanair shares fell following last year's disposal.

The Commission for Aviation Regulation said today it will not instruct the Dublin Airport Authority to introduce 
"differential pricing" for the charges it levies on airlines at Dublin Airport.
Ryanair had strongly argued for charging different airlines varying prices, saying that, since it will not be using the 
new Terminal 2, it should not have to pay for it.
The Aviation regulator published its original decision on the level of charges at Dublin Airport in December, but it 
was brought to an appeals panel by Ryanair, Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority. The appeals panel asked 
the regulator to look again at some aspects of its original decision.
The regulator today said it had changed some of its figures relating to revenue and costs, but had decided against 
differential pricing. As a result, passenger charges for airlines at Dublin Airport will rise by an average of 10 cent per 
passenger a year up to 2014. On differential prices, the CAR said a change in this area was unlikely to affect the 
charges currently paid by different airlines, and that any difference in charges should be determined by airlines' use 
of different services at the airport, and not by costs across the airport.

of different services at the airport, and not by costs across the airport.

Ryanair today hailed as a victory against screenscraping a ruling in a Dutch court that internet reseller Wegolo's 
listings of Ryanair flights on its Website is unlawful.
The Dutch court ruled that the extraction of flight data from Ryanair's website breached Ryanair's rights under 
Dutch Copyright law.
It also found that Wegolo can have a negative impact on Ryanair's website and damage Ryanair's reputation for 
offering the lowest fares in Europe.
Wegolo must now surrender profits made from their unlicensed and unlawful activity to Ryanair and pay Ryanair 
damages and costs. The Dutch company is banned from extracting information from Ryanair's website for the 
purpose of selling Ryanair's flights. The case comes after Ryanair claimed victory over screenscrapers in Ireland, 
the UK and Germany. "Today's victory in the Dutch courts is another milestone in Ryanair's fight against internet 
screenscrapers and resellers. Websites such as Wegolo have for too long been getting away with unauthorised 
reselling of Ryanair's flights with the addition of extra charges, which consumers don't pay when they book directly 
with Ryanair," said spokesman, Stephen McNamara. "Ryanair is pleased that the Dutch courts have recognised 
that this conduct is unlawful. This decision, along with recent decisions in Germany, Ireland and the UK shows that 
European Courts support Ryanair's pro-consumer fight against the unauthorised use of Ryanair's website. It will be 
used as a precedent in ongoing litigation against screenscrapers."

Highlight: A Mobile Fortune
The Life and Times of Denis O'Brien   By Siobhan Creaton Aurum £14.99
Body
Outside Ireland, Denis O'Brien is not as familiar a figure as Michael O'Leary, the puckish chief executive of Ryanair, 
though they have much in common.
From middle-class backgrounds, both cut their teeth working for the late Tony Ryan, founder of Ryanair; both 
accumulated vast fortunes during the Celtic Tiger era; and both are known for their informal yet pugnacious 
business styles. Unlike O'Leary, however, O'Brien opted for tax exile status. And while O'Leary solicits attention 
through tireless selfpublicity, within Ireland O'Brien has received less welcome coverage, due   to his business 
affairs coming under the scrutiny of the Moriarty Tribunal, which has been investigating payments to politicians 
since 1997.
Over the past decade, O'Brien has become a substantial media proprietor. Ranked by Forbes magazine as the 
258th richest person in the world, O'Brien made most of his $3.5bn net worth from telecoms, primarily through 
Digicel, his Caribbean mobile phone network, hence the title of Siobhan Creaton's timely biography, A Mobile 
Fortune . UK readers, however, are more likely to have heard of O'Brien through his skirmishes with the 
Independent News and Media empire, which recently sold the lossmaking Independent newspapers to Alexander 
Lebedev. O'Brien is the largest shareholder in that company.
Acutely protective of his image, O'Brien did not grant Creaton, a former Irish Times finance correspondent and 
author of a previous book on Ryanair and O'Leary, an interview for this book. She has gained access to many   of 
his closest lieutenants, however. Since O'Brien demands total loyalty, such contributions are likely to have had his 
personal blessing and while some are predictably fawning, others are colourful. More colourful still are the 
contributions of those who have fallen foul of the tycoon, since his enmity can be blistering.
Creaton's account opens with a classic O'Brien anecdote about him delaying his Gulfstream jet on the runway to 
haggle over a taxi fare. Although he likes to play the common lad made good, O'Brien's family was comfortably off. 
His father still runs his own horse- care products company, Plusvital.
A nuanced portrait of an ambitious Irish tycoon
Apprenticing himself to Ryan in the early 1980s, O'Brien learned the business merits of forensic preparation but 
also of a dictatorial approach to employee relations. When Ryan's mood swings became intolerable, O'Brien quit.
His first two ventures, a teleshopping channel and a national radio licence application, were both failures, but 
O'Brien proved adept at wooing investors and a Dublin radio licence eventually paid dividends.
O'Brien's make-or-break moment was his battle for Ireland's second mobile phone licence in 1995, which he won, 
but which has been mired in controversy ever since.
The Moriarty Tribunal is due to report on the integrity of that process in the near future. If its findings go against 
O'Brien, the fallout may affect the Irish state, which could be sued by the losing consortia. Inevitably, this section of 
the book is the most gripping, not least because   it details how incredibly close O'Brien came to going bust while 
chasing the prize that generated the basis of his wealth.
He went on to sell his first mobile phone company, Esat Digifone, to   BT for $2.5bn in 2000, allowing him to pocket 
about $400m. Instead of sitting back to enjoy his money,   he went on to conquer the Caribbean.
Conscious of the non-Irish market, Creaton tells O'Brien's story in satisfying detail. Her prose is crisp, her approach 
carefully balanced and she keeps events moving. What emerges is a fascinating yet nuanced portrait of an 
extremely ambitious entrepreneur. Creaton quotes his philosophy: "Get big fast. (Damn) the cost. Be brave. Go 
over the cliff. (The competition) doesn't have the balls."
O'Brien apparently still drives around tropical islands testing the signal strength on his old Nokia handset; heaven 
help his employees if it is ever found wanting.

EasyJet adds 'crewing issues' to its woes
EasyJet adds 'crewing issues' to its woes

Highlight: travel & leisure
Body
EasyJet shares fell 7 per cent yesterday on fears over "crewing issues" at the low-cost airline.
In a second-quarter trading statement, the company said a combination of industrial action by air-traffic control 
workers, the volcanic ash over Europe in the spring and "crewing issues in some parts of our network" had 
contributed to "significant disruption".
Carolyn McCall, who joined as chief executive from Guardian Media Group at the start of this month, said EasyJet 
would seek to address the staffing problems, with a focus on flight delays at Gatwick airport.
The company has been under fire recently from Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, its founder and largest shareholder, over 
punctuality. He has threatened to challenge the group's right to its name if numbers do not improve.
Douglas McNeill at Charles Stanley said the crewing problems were worrying. "We know they've developed a 
problem. But we won't know the causes and the long-term costs of fixing it until November."
EasyJet said the ash cloud had cost the company £65m. It paid £36m in compensation to customers and related 
costs, and lost an estimated £29m in sales.
The company said it was disappointed with the decision by the UK government not to compensate losses related to 
the ash cloud, which forced EasyJet to cancel 7,314 flights.
"We intend to explore all options to secure compensation," it said.
EasyJet's low-cost rival Ryanair reported last week that its volcanic ash-related losses amounted to EUR50m 
(£42m).
Revenues for EasyJet in the three months to the end of June rose 5.3 per cent to £759m and number of seats flown 
was up 1.7 per cent.
EasyJet adds 'crewing issues' to its woes
The company said it expected to make a pre-tax profit this year of between £100m and £150m at current exchange 
rates.
EasyJet has stuck to its plan to invest in more aircraft, in spite of public criticism of the strategy by Sir Stelios.

Highlight: New research shows that Irish mortgage holders are uniquely vulnerable to rising interest rates 
compared to many of their EU counterparts.
Body
News In Brief
## New research shows that Irish mortgage holders are uniquely vulnerable to rising interest rates compared to 
many of their EU counterparts, because of the prevalence of variable rate mortgages. This follows the Financial 
Services Ombudsman's warning yesterday that lenders should not try to move people off low-rate tracker 
mortgages to higher interest variable ones. According to figures from the European Mortgage Federation, 84% of 
mortgages issued in Ireland in the last six months of 2009 were variable. The Irish Mortgage Corporation warns that 
this makes Ireland one of the most sensitive mortgage markets in the EU, as long-term fixed-rate home loans are 
more common in the rest of the union. In Germany almost one quarter of home loans issued are fixed for more than 
ten years. Up to 80% of home loans in Belgium are fixed for the duration of the loan. - RTE
## EBS Building Society, the country's biggest customer-owned lender, set an August 9 deadline for a second 
round of takeover bids, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. Four companies submitted 
initial offers as EBS seeks to raise about 785m euros to meet capital standards set by the country's financial 
regulator. The company may choose a buyer by the end of August, said one person, who declined to comment 
because the process hasn't yet been completed. JC Flowers and Co, the US leveraged buyout firm, Doughty 
Hanson, a British rival, Irish Life and Permanent and Cardinal Asset Management are the four parties involved in 
the first round of bidding. - Irish Examiner
## Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary sold nearly 20m euro of shares in the airline yesterday. The carrier's shares have 
soared in recent weeks amid confirmation of a 500m euro dividend that will be paid to shareholders in the autumn 
and a robust financial performance. Mr O'Leary, who before yesterday owned more than 60 m shares, or 4.04pc of 
Ryanair, is understood to have offloaded five million shares at 3.90 euro each. That resulted in a gain of 19.5m 
euro, which is then subject to capital gains tax of 20pc, making for a 3.9m euro windfall for the exchequer and 
Roundup: Irish hit worst by rate hikes Irish Hit Worst
leaving Mr O'Leary with 15.6m euro. - Irish Independent ## The bank loans associated with the disastrous 411m 
euro acquisition of the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend, Dublin, in 2006 by a consortium including the Dublin 
Docklands Development Association have been moved to NAMA. The agency has now asked the consortium, 
Becbay, to submit a business plan before the end of this month. However, the shareholders in the consortium are

stewards from the four local authorities in Dublin are to meet today to discuss the planned outsourcing of waste 
collection by Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to a private operator. The meeting will also be given an 
update on talks to try to resolve the dispute. Workers in South Dublin, Fingal and Dublin City Councils have already 
voted to take industrial action in support of their colleagues in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown if the talks fail. - RTE ## 
Element6, the industrial diamond manufacturer majority-owned by De Beers that last year shelved a plan to close 
its plant in Shannon, made a loss of USD 40.5m (29m euro) in 2008 as it paid out nearly USD 18m in redundancy 
and restructuring costs and administrative expenses rose to USD 151m from USD 131m. Accounts just filed for the 
business at the Companies Office show that turnover at the business fell from USD 358.3m in 2007 to USD 351m in 
2008. - Irish Independent ## Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey has insisted a train service will run between 
Dublin and Navan by 2016, despite the project not being mentioned in the revised capital spending programme. 
Asked if major projects outside Dublin had been put on hold following the government's announcement on Monday 
of a 39bn euro investment plan, Mr Dempsey insisted construction on the railway link would go ahead once 
planning permission was granted. "The next stage for the Navan rail line is that they submit their planning 
permission, he said. "I'm not sure how long it will take to get through the planning stage bit once it gets through the

Ryanair today said that it has awarded its Irish/UK Media and Communications business to Edelman (Ireland) after 
a competitive tender process in which over 30 agencies pitched to represent the airline.
Edelman will take over Ryanair's UK/Ireland communications from Murray Consultants from the start of next month.
Ryanair and Murrays parted earlier this month after a relationship spanning 15 years.
"We are pleased to announce Edelman as our new media and communications agency for the UK and Ireland after 
a very competitive tender process involving many agencies in the UK and Ireland. Edelman will assume 
responsibility for all Ryanair media contacts from 1st August. We congratulate Mark Cahalane and Joe Carmody in 
winning this business for Edelman and we look forward to working with them," said Ryanair's Stephen McNamara. 
"We are looking forward to supporting Ryanair and know that the work will be both challenging and rewarding. Our 
team will focus on partnering in the development of Ryanair's story, as it continues to deliver lower airfares, 
increased routes and a no nonsense approach to everything it does," said Mark Cahalane, Managing Director, 
Edelman Ireland.

The main Dublin shares index inched lower after earlier gains on the back of a European stocks rally but was

European shares hit a five-week high on Tuesday, gaining for a sixth consecutive session, boosted by strong 
corporate earnings from banks, with UBS soaring after results beat analysts' expectations. The results of European 
bank stress tests late on Friday helped restore confidence in the sector as it contained no major negative surprises, 
and showed only seven of 91 banks failed the tests aimed at gauging banks' ability to withstand financial shocks.

flat; state spend will continue to struggle; and stimulus funds will roll off, it said. "In 2011, we now expect volumes to 
be flat to slightly positive yoy (original forecast +4pc, PCA forecast +13pc). This breaks down as infrastructure flat to

Ryanair suffered an 11 per cent fall-off in revenues from Irish customers last year, despite a 1 per cent increase in 
total revenues, according to figures published by the no-frills airline last week.
Ryanair's annual report revealed that revenue originating in Ireland fell to  357million in the year to March 2010, 
down from  402 million a year earlier.
The airline's total revenues rose marginally from  2.9 billion to  3 billion.
The 11 per cent decline in revenues was largely driven by a 13 per cent fall-off in Irish passenger numbers.
The report also revealed that Ryanair's Irish revenue was 15 per cent lower than the  421 million recorded in the 
year to March 2008.
The company, headed by chief executive Michael O'Leary, did not break down its Irish-originated revenues in 
previous annual reports.
Instead, Ryanair only disclosed a breakdown of revenues between those originating in Britain and those in the rest 
of Europe.
British revenues fell 12 per cent year-on-year to  839 million. Ireland accounted for just 12 per cent of the airline's 
total revenues in the 12 months to March 2010, compared with 14 per cent a year earlier and 15 per cent in the 
period to March 2008.
The airline reported pretax profits of  104 million for the three months to June last week, despite recording a  50 
million once-off charge arising from the effects of Icelandic volcanic ash disruption to flight schedules during the 
quarter.

After confirmation that Cathal Goan is leaving his role as director general of RTE, the search for a replacement 
begins. According to RTE insiders, obvious potential contenders include Noel Curran, who left his job as RTE's 
director of television just a few months ago, but who might consider a return.
Conor Hayes, RTE's financial controller, is also high on the list. Hayes, a former Ryanair chief executive, was 
regarded as a strong contender for the director-general role back in 2003, when it went to Goan.
He has been the key player in developing RTE's digital television strategy, which is a big issue for RTE as it faces a 
switch-off of the analogue signal by 2012.
Clare Duignan, currently managing director of radio, has a background in television and radio programming. Ed 
Mulhall, managing director of news, is also a possible contender.
Both Duignan and Mulhall would have common ground with Goan, whose extensive programming background 
made him popular among editorial staff in particular at RTE.
The current head of television, Glen Killane, is less likely to be in the frame as he has just taken over the role from 
Curran. Geraldine O'Leary, head of advertising sales, was rumoured to have been considered for head of 
television, so may also be a contender.
Despite occasional controversies - such as calls for him to be sacked over RTE's coverage oft he Brian Cowen 
nude portraits - Goan kept a low profile outside RTE. Inside the national broadcaster, he is well-respected.
''He's always been remarkably accessible to staff and colleagues, even unusually so," said one RTE insider. ''I also 
think people found his experience in programme-making very reassuring.
This is an editorial company and he came from that background so it seemed right."
Search for next RTE boss commences
The economic downturn created headaches for Goan in the past three years.
He is leaving RTE just as the television advertising market is showing signs of some kind of recovery.
He took on a major role in selling to RTE's sceptical trade unions a plan to cut pay as advertising revenue fell. He is 
credited with insisting on prioritising jobs and output.
It helped that RTE proposed a tiered pay reduction plan that saw top earners such as Goan take a heavier hit on 
pay, with a  65,000 cut from  380,000.
The result has been that RTE still has more than 2,000 employees, having lost what is expected to be less than 200 
staff to career break schemes and voluntary redundancy.
Goan oversaw Pat Kenny's departure from the Late Late Show slot and appointed his replacement, Ryan Tubridy, 
which has paid off in ratings terms. More recently, the broadcaster was hit by the death of Gerry Ryan, probably its 
biggest star in radio.
There had been speculation that Goan would not renew his contract at RTE, but before the announcement of his 
planned departure was made last week, some colleagues were starting to assume he had decided to stay.
It is expected that the next RTE director-general will also be offered a seven-year contract on a salary of more than  
300,000.
Goan is expected to remain at RTE until October, pending interviews for his successor.

Aer Lingus raises outlook, cites strong June fares

Aer Lingus, the former Irish state airline struggling to survive in the shadow of Ryanair, said Thursday it's raising its 
outlook for 2010 amid a surge in summer fares.
In a trading update for the January-June period, Aer Lingus said it is earning more and spending less than in 2009. 
It cited lower costs of staff and fuel and surprisingly strong fares and sales on its trans-Atlantic routes in June, the 
start of the industry's most lucrative summer months.
Aer Lingus shares rose 1.3 percent to (EURO)0.90 a new high for the year on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Aer Lingus said its average trans-Atlantic fares increased 17.4 percent versus the first half of 2009, while fares on 
European routes rose 9 percent.
The airline cut nearly a third of its seats on trans-Atlantic services in 2009 as part of an effort to boost capacity, cut 
costs and make the U.S. routes traditionally the key earners for Aer Lingus profitable again.
"Recent yield performance and long-haul load factors have exceeded our expectations, and the forward-booking 
profile suggests that this strength should continue for at least the third quarter," the Aer Lingus trading statement 
said.
Aer Lingus credited its unionized work force with accepting painful cutbacks that are driving the airline's turn away 
from deep losses in 2008 and 2009.
It said that so long as summertime services are not disrupted by volcanic ash as happened in April and May the 
company's operating profit before any exceptional items "should be no worse than break even." The airline 
previously had warned of a third straight year of operating losses.
Aer Lingus said it couldn't provide performance guidance for 2011. It plans to publish its first-half results Aug. 24.
Aer Lingus raises outlook, cites strong June fares
Ryanair has been trying to take over its smaller Irish rival ever since the Irish government privatized Aer Lingus in 
2006. Ryanair is the biggest Aer Lingus shareholder with a 30 percent stake. But the second-largest owner, the 
Irish government with a 25 percent stake, has helped to block any merger on competition grounds.

Its sales rose by 10pc, driven by a growing use of its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri.
The company has been struggling towards profitability for several years.
Shares in Siteserv were unchanged at 75 after it too released results showing a narrowing of its losses in the year 
to April, despite a fall in revenues. Overall the ISEQ index was up 5.64 points in cautious trading a short time ago at 
2,878.75. AIB was flat on 87 and Bank of Ireland was up 1c to 71 as both await the results of EU stress tests, due 
tomorrow. Among the big industrials, Smurfit Kappa was ahead by 16c to 755 and Ryanair had lifted by 6c to 401. 
CRH was down 17c, however, to 1548 and distribution group DCC had slipped by 9c to 1830.

The ISEQ rose back above the 2,800 level this morning in line with bourses across Europe as investors scooped up 
recently battered shares on hopes that the rest of the US earnings season will see improvements.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had risen by 50.14 points to 2,869.48.
Banks were entirely unmoved in Dublin despite a general rally in the sector on European markets as investors 
scooped up recently battered banking shares on hopes the sector's stress test results will be reassuring. Shares in 
AIB were unmoved at E0.86, Bank of Ireland stood at E0.70 and Irish Life and Permanent was flat at E1.57.
Ireland issued another E1.5bn in long-term debt yesterday. That means that E18bn, or 90pc, of the E20bn target for 
2010 has been completed. Crucially, that target encompassed about E5bn of pre-funding for 2011: the NTMA has 
stated that borrowing needs are now covered up until Q2 2011. Despite the successful auction, Irish spreads 
remain wider than they should. The 5-year CDS market is still pricing in a default probability of 20pc. Ryanair's Q1 
performance clearly illustrates its very strong underlying performance, according to Davy, with ancillaries up 14pc, 
ex-fuel costs up less than 1pc despite a 13pc stage length increase, and yields up 5pc despite a negative Easter 
comparable and some discounting following the ash cloud disruption - there was also lost revenue from the 
reimbursement of the 1.45m passengers. Davy's forecasts imply a net profit of E454m in the H1 summer, implying 
a loss of almost E80m in the winter. For the full year, the broker assumes yields up 8.8pc, including 12.5pc in Q2, 
and ex-fuel costs up 3.5pc. "We note the current strong run-rate and would point to the sensitivity of the numbers to 
both yield and ex-fuel costs: 6pc and 4pc to full-year EPS for each percentage change respectively," it said. Shares 
in Ryanair jumped 13c to E3.96. Aer lingus gained 1c to E0.87. Elan's partner in the US, Biogen Idec has reported 
solid Tysabri results for Q2 (July 20th), with an encouraging uptick in net patient additions per week. Elan will report

Volcano sparks Ryanair fares alert

Ryanair forecast that fares could rise by as much as 15 per cent over the summer after the low-cost airline reported 
a fall in firstquarter profits, partly caused by the Icelandic volcanic eruption.
Profits for the quarter ending June 30 fell 24 per cent to EUR93.7m (£79m) after plumes of ash from the Icelandic 
volcano led to the closure of European airspace in April and May.
The disruption led to the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights, travel chaos for thousands of passengers and cost 
the airline EUR50m ($65m). But earnings were still better than expected, which, combined with a rise in average 
fares, pushed Ryanair shares higher in early trading. Average fares were expected to rise by between 10 and 15 
per cent in the second quarter, the airline said.
About 1.5m passengers disrupted by the Icelandic volcano have received refunds for their tickets.
Despite initial objections, Ryanair also agreed to cover food and accommodation expenses for customers who 
could not get home after their flights were cancelled.
As well as the EUR50m pre-tax ash cloud charge, profits were held back by a 34 per cent year-on-year rise in fuel 
costs. But this was partly offset by a 5 per cent increase in average fares, an 8 per cent increase in passenger 
numbers and lower airport charges as competition for business increased among European terminals following the 
recession. Underlying net profit rose 1.5 per cent to EUR138.5m, ahead of analysts' expectations of EUR128m. 
Sales rose 16 per cent to EUR896.8m.
Ryanair charges passengers for checked-in bags, food and other services, and revenue from these services rose 
strongly, partly because the average journey times lengthened, giving cabin crew more opportunity to sell items 
during the flight.
Revenues from these services now account for 23 per cent of the total.
Volcano sparks Ryanair fares alert
The group plans to pay its first dividend in October and said its outlook for the full year remained "cautious and 
unchanged". Underlying net profit for the current financial year is expected to increase between 10 and 15 per cent, 
it said.
Ryanair shares closed flat at EUR3.83.
  FT Comment 
Ryanair has performed well in the downturn as passengers traded down from flag carriers. Its strategy of using 
cheaper airports is paying off, as the 8 per cent fall in airport costs per seat shows.
The hope must be that yields will rise further if and when consumer confidence returns. But given the uncertainty 
over the economy, the shares - trading on 16 times current full-year estimates compared with EasyJet at 15.7 times 
- are already fairly priced.

* BP has announced plans to raise an estimated $8.7bn from asset sales; most of the cash will come from a $7bn 
deal with Apache, the US independent oil and gas company, which is buying onshore gas assets in the US, Canada 
and Egypt.
* Carlyle, the US private equity group, is vying with three Philippines business groups to buy half of San Miguel 
Pure Foods, the country's largest food producer with a market capitalisation of 57.5bn pesos ($1.2bn).
* Andy Stewart has retired from the board of Cenkos Securities five months after he moved to take a back-seat role 
at the broker he founded five years ago.
* Carl Icahn has launched a renewed hostile bid of $6.50 a share - less than the $7 a share offer he made a few

Ryanair Q1 profit falls over volcano, fuel costs
Ryanair Q1 profit falls over volcano, fuel costs

Body
Irish budget airline Ryanair reported a 24 percent drop in first-quarter net profit Tuesday, citing (EURO)50 million 
($65 million) in lost business from the Icelandic volcano as well as a rising fuel bill but the carrier says it remains 
poised to keep expanding.
Net profit for the April-June quarter fell to (EURO)93.7 million ($121.8 million) from (EURO)123 million in the same 
quarter a year ago.
Income from ticket sales rose 14 percent to (EURO)692.9 million, while revenue from other income sources 
including the company's extra charges on everything from baggage to credit-card use as well as its commissions for 
insurance, hotel and car-rental bookings on its Web site rose 23 percent to (EURO)165.3 million.
"We continue to see enormous opportunities to grow our business across Europe as many airports vigorously 
compete to attract Ryanair's traffic growth," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said. "This aggressive competition 
between airports has resulted in airport unit costs falling by 8 percent."
Most airline analysts had expected Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano to do more damage to Ryanair's bottom line. 
Investors snapped up shares Tuesday in growing expectation that Ryanair has positioned itself well for serving 
summer sun spots, particularly in Spain, where the airline has boosted operations from Barcelona to the Canary 
Islands off Morocco's coast.
In Dublin, Ryanair shares initially jumped more than 4 percent, then settled back at (EURO)3.80, up 0.5 percent in 
morning trade on the Irish Stock Exchange.
The Dublin-based airline reiterated its previous guidance for full-year net profit to rise 10-15 percent to a range of 
(EURO)350 million to (EURO)375 million. That estimate excludes exceptional losses such as volcano-related 
cancelations and refunds.
Ryanair reported an exceptional pre-tax loss of (EURO)50 million because European air traffic authorities canceled 
9,400 Ryanair flights due to carry 1.5 million passengers in April and May during the volcanic ash threat. The 
Ryanair Q1 profit falls over volcano, fuel costs
airline's unaudited statement noted that this loss figure represents only an initial estimate, because Ryanair has yet 
to pay out refunds to many of its passengers left stranded during the ash crisis.
O'Leary repeated his criticisms of a European Union consumer law that requires airlines rather than travel 
insurance companies or governments to reimburse customers' hotel and meal bills when their flights are grounded 
by natural disasters. O'Leary said the relevant European law "should be urgently amended to prevent this unfair, 
disproportionate and discriminatory treatment of EU airlines."
Despite all those grounded flights, Ryanair said it still spent (EURO)286.6 million on fuel, 24 percent more than in 
the April-June period of 2009. The extra cost reflected rising oil prices and Ryanair's ever-expanding route network, 
which now reaches 155 destinations across Europe.
Ryanair said it has purchased advance contracts for 90 percent of its expected aviation-fuel needs through 2011 
and the first half of 2012 at rates of $730 and $755 per metric ton, respectively. Aviation fuel has risen sharply in 
price this month and currently exceeds $690 per ton.
Not that Ryanair will have trouble paying its fuel bills. The cash-rich airline said its reserves have risen 11 percent to 
(EURO)3.1 billion over the past year. It plans to pay its first-ever dividend to shareholders on Oct. 1 a (EURO)500 
million payment expected to gift O'Leary, one of the company's biggest shareholders, a pre-tax gain of (EURO)20 
million.

Ryanair has this morning maintained its full-year profit forecast despite quarterly profit falling 24pc on disruption 
caused by volcanic ash.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said its net profit for the three months to the end of June came in at 93.7m euros 
after accounting for the 50m euro cost of almost 10,000 flights cancelled in April and May.
"Despite these volcanic ash disruptions Ryanair continues to increase traffic, yields, and profits, while most of our 
competitors are cutting capacity and reporting losses," chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Adjusted net profit rose 1pc to 138.5m euros, compared with a forecast for pre-exceptional profit of 118.6 m euros 
by in-house broker Davy. Ryanair maintained its forecast for full-year net profit to rise by between 10 to 15 pc to 
between 350 and 375m euros -- a forecast which it last month said excluded the 50m euro ash cloud charge. Most 
of Ryanair's growth comes from the European continent, and it is reducing capacity in Dublin, blaming a tourist tax 
introduced last year as part of Ireland's austerity drive. Ryanair, vying with Deutsche Lufthansa for the position of 
Europe's biggest airline by market value, said its first-quarter revenue rose 16 pc to 896.8m euros and reiterated its 
plans to pay its first ever dividend in October.

Ryanair Q1 Profit Declines On Volcanic Ash Cloud Costs; Backs Full Year View - Update
Ryanair Q1 Profit Declines On Volcanic Ash Cloud Costs; Backs Full Year 
View - Update

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported Tuesday a decline in profit for the 
first quarter, affected mainly by costs associated with Icelandic volcanic ash related closures. On an adjusted basis, 
profit increased from last year, reflecting an increase in number of passengers and average fares, despite a 34% 
rise in fuel costs. The company also backed its full-year forecast for net profit growth, while stating that the outlook 
remains cautious.
First-quarter profit before tax, on International Financial Reporting Standards or IFRS basis, declined to 104.6 
million euros, or about US$135.8 million, from prior year's 134.6 million euros. The latest quarter results included 
exceptional costs of 50 million euros from the volcanic ash airspace closures in April and May.
Excluding exceptional items, profit before tax grew to 154.6 million euros from 148.1 million euros a year earlier.
On an after-tax basis, profit attributable to equity holders of parent fell to 93.7 million euros (about US$121.6 million) 
or 6.30 euro cents per share from 123.0 million euros or 8.31 euro cents per share a year ago.
Adjusted net profit edged up 1% to 138.5 million euros or 9.32 euro cents per share from 136.5 million euros or 9.23 
euro cents per share in the previous year.
Ryanair, which operates a fleet of 250 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft with firm orders for a further 72 new aircraft, 
reported total operating revenues for the first quarter of 896.8 million euros, up 16% from 774.7 million euros 
generated in the comparable period a year earlier.
The company attributed the strong revenue growth to an 8% rise in traffic and a 5% increase in average fares due 
to rise in average sector lengths.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased 14% year-over-year to 692.9 million euros, on an 8% rise in passenger 
volumes and a 5% increase in average fares. Ancillary revenues grew 23% from last year to 203.9 million euros, 
reflecting "higher onboard spend, improved product mix, increased take up of priority boarding, and higher internet 
related revenues."
Number of passengers rose 8% in the quarter to 18 million from last year's 16.6 million. The company pointed out 
that the airspace closures in April and May, following the Icelandic volcano ash clound, led to cancellation of 9,400 
Ryanair flights, and the loss of almost 1.5 million passengers in the first quarter.
Ryanair Q1 Profit Declines On Volcanic Ash Cloud Costs; Backs Full Year View - Update
In the quarter, total revenue per passenger increased 7%, while load factor remained flat at 83%. Yields rose 5% 
due to a 13% increase in sector length, offset by price promotions launched after the airspace closures.
Operating profit for the quarter declined to 119.4 million euros from prior year's 154.7 million euros, but adjusted 
operating profit increased 10% to 169.4 million euros from 154.7 million euros last year.
Total operating expenses for the first quarter climbed to 777.4 million euros from 620.0 million euros in 2009, 
primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and operating costs associated with the 
growth of the airline.
In the quarter, fuel costs rose 34% to 287 million euros due to higher oil prices and sector length increase, and unit 
costs rose 9%.
Commenting on the results, Ryanair's Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary, said, "Our Q1 profits were adversely 
impacted by the unnecessary closures of European airspace for 18 days in April and May. Despite these volcanic 
ash disruptions Ryanair continues to increase traffic, yields, and profits, while most of our competitors are cutting 
capacity and reporting losses."
Looking ahead, Ryanair said its outlook for the year remains cautious and unchanged.
For the year, the company continues to expect net profits to rise 10% to 15% or between approximately 350 million 
euros and 375 million euros. Passenger volumes are expected to rise 11% to 73.5 million, before any volcanic ash 
disruptions.
For the second quarter, yields are projected to rise between 10% to 15%, but the company remains cautious about 
yields for the coming winter, in second half. For the year, the company expects yields increase to be within the 
range of 5% to 10% previously guided, and unit costs excluding fuel will increase by about 4%.
RYAAY closed Monday's regular trading session at $30.15, flat with previous day, on a volume of 378,900 shares.
On the London Stock Exchange, RYA.L is currently trading at 3.82 pence, up 0.0550 pence or 1.46%, on 1.91 
million shares.

(RTTNews) - U.S. stock futures point to a lower opening Tuesday morning, awaiting earnings from major 
companies, including Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson, due to be released before the markets open.
Mixed earnings from technology companies including Texas Instruments and IBM might weigh on market 
sentiment, even as earnings season gains further momentum. The Commerce Department's housing starts report 
may also be on the radar, given the recent spate of weak housing market readings following the expiration of 
homebuyers' credit.
As at 6.15 a.m ET, the Dow futures were down 88.00 points, the S&P 500 futures were down 10.30 points, and the 
tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures were down 18.50 points.
On the economic front, the Department of Commerce will release its report on housing starts and building permits 
for June at 8.30 a.m. ET. Economists estimate housing starts of 575,000 for June.
Even as the global markets await the official results of the stress tests on European banks, reports suggest that 
Germany's Hypo Real Estate Holding AG failed the stress tests.
A slew of earnings from major companies will be in traders' focus.
Before the market opens, Financial services giant Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Bank of New York Mellon Corp. 
(BK), Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB), Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX), Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG), Illinois Tool Works Inc. 
(ITW), healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Marshall & Ilsley Corp. (MI), soft drink maker PepsiCo, Inc. 
(PEP), State Street Corp. (STT), and diversified health and well-being company UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) are 
among the major companies that will report quarterly results.
Programmable chipmaker Altera Corp. (ALTR), Apple Inc. (AAPL), drug maker Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD), Juniper 
Networks Inc. (JNPR), and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) are among the major companies that will report results after the 
markets close.
Earlier in the day, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) reported a decline in profit for the first quarter, 
affected mainly by costs associated with Icelandic volcanic ash related closures. On an adjusted basis, profit 
increased from last year, reflecting an increase in number of passengers and average fares, despite a 34% rise in 
fuel costs.
Wall Street Poised For Weak Opening Ahead Of Bank Earnings
Traders will also focus on corporate results reported after the markets closed in the previous session.
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said that its second quarter profit rose 9% from last year, helped by 
higher revenue and improved margins. The company's quarterly earnings per share came in above analysts' 
expectations but its quarterly revenue fell short of analysts' forecast.
Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), said that its second-quarter profit more than doubled from last year, driven mainly by 
the strengthening demand in worldwide chip market on 3G and other electronic equipment sales. Though quarterly 
earnings met analysts' expectations, revenues missed the Street consensus.
Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD) said that it swung to a second quarter profit, as sales more than doubled from last 
year. However, the company's quarterly earnings per share came in below analysts' expectations.
Zions Bancorp. (ZION) reported a wider loss for the second quarter, compared with the year-ago period, primarily 
on a decrease in net interest margin and an increase in allowances for loans losses and non-performing assets.
<b> Oil </b> Light sweet crude oil for August delivery is presently quoted at $76.48 a barrel, down $0.06 a barrel 
from its previous close of $76.54 a barrel in New York on Monday.
<b>Dollar</b> The U.S. dollar is presently trading higher against the pound, the yen and the euro.
<b> World Markets </b> The major markets in Asia, except Japan and India, ended in positive territory on 
speculation that China will not tighten its monetary policy further amid signs of cooling in the economy. Positive 
closing on Wall Street in the previous session, despite weak economic data ,on earnings optimism lifted market 
sentiment. China's Shanghai composite index gained more than 2% lifting the morale of other markets in the region. 
However, Japan's Nikkei index declined on stronger yen and India's Nifty ended in negative territory on weak 
futures from US market. European markets have pared early gains and are presently trading in negative territory.

PRETTY SMOOTH LANDING: Despite booking losses of at least $65 million on the Icelandic volcano and shelling 
out more for fuel costs, Irish budget airline Ryanair's first-quarter earnings still topped expectations.
THE BOTTOM LINE: Ryanair's net income dropped 24 percent to 93.7 million euros ($121.8 million). Income from 
ticket sales rose 14 percent to 692.9 million euros, and revenue from the carrier's myriad extra fees rose 23 percent 
to 165.3 million euros.
ANALYSTS' TAKE: Most had expected Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano to do more damage to Ryanair's bottom 
line. Many believe the low-cost airline is well-positioned to serve summer sun spots, particularly in Spain, where it 
has boosted operations from Barcelona to the Canary Islands.

Irish budget airline Ryanair reported a 24 percent drop in net first-quarter profits Tuesday, citing lost business from 
the Icelandic volcano and rising fuel costs.
Net profit for the April-June quarter fell to (EURO)93.7 million ($121.8 million) from (EURO)123 million in the same 
quarter a year ago. Revenues rose 14 percent to (EURO)692.9 million.
Ryanair reported an exceptional loss of (EURO)50 million because European air traffic authorities canceled 9,400 
Ryanair flights in April and May, citing fears of airborne volcanic ash. The airline spent (EURO)286.6 million on fuel, 
24 percent more than in the April-June period of 2009.

Irish shares broke a four session run of losses this morning as they tracked European markets cautiously higher.
The global mood has improved on optimism about US corporate earnings ahead of results from US firms Goldman 
Sachs and Apple.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 12.67 points a short time ago at 2,833.35.
Ryanair was up 2c to 380 after maintaining its full year profit forecast despite announcing a 24pc fall this morning in 
quarterly earnings due to volcanic ash. CRH was up up 5c to 1550 and Kerry Group had advanced by 18c to 2416. 
Providence Resources was up 14c on continuing hopes for its prospects off the west coast. But it wasn't all good 
news. Banks were all flat, AIB on 85, Bank of Ireland at 66 and Irish Life and Permanent on 158. Distribution group 
DCC was down 5c at 1820 and Kingspan had shed 26c to 531.

The ISEQ fell this morning after global ratings agency, Moody's, downgraded Ireland's sovereign debt rating.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had dipped 13.31 points to 2,839.20.
Moody's has downgraded Ireland by one notch to Aa2 this morning. That is its second downgrade (from Aaa), the 
first coming a year ago. But it was not that surprising, as the rating agency had assigned a negative outlook at that 
time, according to Davy Research. The broker said that there are a couple of important points to make. First, 
Moody's now rates Ireland in line with S and P at two notches below the top level (Fitch is one notch lower again). 
Second, the outlook is now described as stable, which means that a further downgrade is officially equally as likely 
as an upgrade. In its statement, Moody's outlines the rationale for its action. It points to a loss of 'financial strength': 
in effect the rise in the government debt burden and the increased repayment costs associated with higher debt. 
Moody's also alludes to the potential for structurally lower medium-term growth. And, finally, it notes that some of 
the contingent liabilities for the banking system have been crystallised.
Shares in AIB edged down 1c to E0.87, Bank of Ireland also dipped 1c to E0.68 and Irish Life and Permanent rose 
1c to E1.60. Carrs Milling, the UK agrifood group, says Q3 trading is "well ahead" of expectations. The company 
says demand for feed and fertiliser has been boosted by a lack of forage on farms after a tough winter. Origin 
Enterprises should also benefit from a recovery in demand for farm inputs as output prices (dairy) and volume 
rebound in Ireland during 2010. Origin's shares climbed 10c to E2.40. Kerry rose 11c to E24.00 and Aryzta fell 43c 
to E31.90. Ryanair has announced that a rush of summer bookings will most likely see it carry over 7m passengers 
in July, which would set a record for the most passengers carried in a month by a European airline. The large 
number of last-minute summer bookings is believed be partially precipitated by the World Cup - with families 
deciding to book a holiday as their favourite teams were knocked out of the competition. Last July, Ryanair carried 
6.7m passengers. Ryanair shares rose 3c to E3.85 and Aer Lingus gained 2c to E0.87. MBL, a UK distributor and

wholesaler of home entertainment products such as DVDs, CDs and games, has reported a 35.7pc increase in 
revenues for the 12 months to end-March 2010. Revenue growth was in part driven by the integration of business

cash flow increased to £6.8m from £1.7m in the prior year. Irish distributor, DCC, saw its shares dip 3c to E18.42.

The ISEQ fell sharply on Monday after global ratings agency, Moody's, downgraded Ireland's sovereign debt rating.
The index dropped 34.84 points to 2,820.68.
Moody's has downgraded Ireland by one notch to Aa2. That is its second downgrade (from Aaa), the first coming a 
year ago. But it was not that surprising, as the rating agency had assigned a negative outlook at that time, 
according to Davy Research. The broker said that there are a couple of important points to make. First, Moody's 
now rates Ireland in line with S and P at two notches below the top level (Fitch is one notch lower again). Second, 
the outlook is now described as stable, which means that a further downgrade is officially equally as likely as an 
upgrade. In its statement, Moody's outlines the rationale for its action. It points to a loss of 'financial strength': in 
effect the rise in the government debt burden and the increased repayment costs associated with higher debt. 
Moody's also alludes to the potential for structurally lower medium-term growth. And, finally, it notes that some of 
the contingent liabilities for the banking system have been crystallised.
Shares in AIB edged down 3c to E0.85, Bank of Ireland also dipped 3c to E0.66 and Irish Life and Permanent fell 1c 
to E1.58. NAMA said it has now completed the transfer of the second tranche of loans from Allied Irish Banks, Bank 
of Ireland, Irish Nationwide Building Society and EBS with a face value of E5.2 billion. NAMA securities with a value 
of E2.7 billion have been issued to the four institutions. This represents a weighted average discount of 48pc for the 
four banks on this tranche. Loans will be acquired from the remaining institution - Anglo Irish Bank - over the 
coming weeks after all necessary due diligence material has been received and evaluated. To date, some E20.5 
billion of loans have been acquired at a consideration of E10.4 billion showing a discount or "haircut" close to 50pc. 
Carrs Milling, the UK agrifood group, says Q3 trading is "well ahead" of expectations. The company says demand 
for feed and fertiliser has been boosted by a lack of forage on farms after a tough winter. Origin Enterprises should 
also benefit from a recovery in demand for farm inputs as output prices (dairy) and volume rebound in Ireland

during 2010. Origin's shares climbed 10c to E2.40. Kerry rose 13c to E24.02 and Aryzta fell 38c to E31.95. Ryanair 
has announced that a rush of summer bookings will most likely see it carry over 7m passengers in July, which 
would set a record for the most passengers carried in a month by a European airline. The large number of last-
minute summer bookings is believed be partially precipitated by the World Cup - with families deciding to book a 
holiday as their favourite teams were knocked out of the competition. Last July, Ryanair carried 6.7m passengers. 
Ryanair shares fell 3c to E3.79 and Aer Lingus was flat at E0.85. MBL, a UK distributor and wholesaler of home 
entertainment products such as DVDs, CDs and games, has reported a 35.7pc increase in revenues for the 12 
months to end-March 2010. Revenue growth was in part driven by the integration of business segments combined 
with growth in 'chart' sales. MBL's profit-before-tax grew 22.2pc to £9.9m while its operating cash flow increased to 
£6.8m from £1.7m in the prior year. Irish distributor, DCC, saw its shares dip 19c to E18.25.

Local investors may be feeling cold towards the Irish banks, given the very rough ride they've had in recent years. 
But new figures from BNY Mellon suggest that international investors have been fairly active in the main two banks.
Given the fact that share prices have remained severely under pressure, much of this activity is likely to have been 
speculative, however.
A number of Irish-listed companies operate depositary receipt (DR) programmes, which allow investors to buy 
stocks in foreign companies through their local stock exchanges.
The Irish-listed companies that operate these programmes include AIB, Bank of Ireland, CRH, Elan, Icon, Ryanair 
and Kerry.
This means investors in the US and elsewhere can buy into these companies in dollars. BNY Mellon tracks the 
volume and value of dealings in American and Global Depositary Receipts and has published figures for the first 
half of 2010,which revealed all-time record levels of dealing in DRs globally.
Three Irish companies were among the top 100 most actively traded US listed DRs in the first six months of the 
year. AIB was the 27th most actively-traded through these securities, with 622 million shares traded with a value of 
$2.2 billion.
Elan was the 44th most actively traded US-listed DR globally, and Bank of Ireland ranked 73rd.
The value of Irish shares traded through these securities was about $14 billion, compared with $9.5 billion in the 
first half of 2009.
BNY Mellon said that overall activity in DR trading suggested that international investors were seeking more 
investments outside the US.
Comment
However, it is difficult to know whether this increased activity in Irish shares had any real benefit for Irish stocks, 
given the performance of most shares in the first half of the year.

The long-awaited week in the sun has become a thing of the past for many, with Irish people holding out for deals 
and booking holidays as little as a week in advance.
This year, travel agents were attempting to sell 300,000 'seats to the sun' - down from a million seats in 2007, a 70 
per cent drop - but they still reported a tough time selling holidays.
They said the sector was still being hit by poor consumer sentiment, while the good weather early in the summer 
also meant more people were putting off a foreign holiday.
''Families in particular are waiting until the last minute to see if they will go away, or whether there will be sun at 
home," said Pat Dawson, president of the Irish Travel Agents Association, which represents about 170 companies.
''The only advance bookings now are for cruises, and the average lead-in time to booking a holiday is seven to 14 
days."
Dawson said that advance bookings from earlier this year had also been affected by the uncertainty caused by the 
volcanic ash cloud.
However, that has had a positive side effect for travel agents, as many people were now wary of booking 
independently in case they lost their money in the event of disruption.
''Ironically, we are busier because of the ash, as people saw that they were covered when booked with an agent," 
said Dawson.
He said that Morocco and Turkey were popular destinations this year, with week-long holidays available for less 
than  400. Seats on charter flights to sun destinations were available at up to  95 less than the main airlines, he 
said.
Consumers seeking late holiday deals
Tanya Airey, managing director of Sunway, said that sales of package holidays were ahead of last year, which she 
described as ''the worst year in recent memory''.
''Last week and this week, things have picked up.
Turkey is the biggest destination with great value deals on B&B or half-board basis there. The usual spots of 
Lanzarote and Gran Canaria are popular, while more people are now veering to Tunisia and Morocco," she said.
Airey said that the market was now a lot smaller for tour operators and travel agents, but said Sunway was holding 
steady with a market share of about 20 per cent.
One of the biggest blows to the market was the closure of Budget Travel. It was the country's largest package 
holiday operator, offering 180,000 of the 400,000 sun holidays that were on sale last year.
Clem Walshe, a travel consultant and former marketing manager of Budget Travel, said that some of these had 
been ''mopped up'' by other agents, but many were gone.
''The recession has shaved about 25 per cent of business out of the market, while Aer Lingus and Ryanair are now 
offering more seats to sun destinations," he said.
''Bookings are very much price-driven now, but, in some cases, last-minute deals means the quality can be 
compromised.
''I think there will always be a place for package holidays and their operators, but there was a cleaning out of the 
weaker businesses and now there are more quality agents there," he said.

BELGIUM Fans of Tintin are being offered the chance to follow in his globe-trotting footsteps. Moulinsart, the body 
that manages the estate of Hergé, Tintin's creator, has joined forces with tour operator On The Go to launch a 
series of holidays themed around the adventures of the young comic-book hero. The trips begin next month with a 
long weekend in Brussels, Hergé's home, followed later in the year by tours to India, Egypt and Jordan. Many trips 
are led by Tintin experts, such as Alain Baran, a former assistant of Hergé, and the British writer Michael Farr, 
author of Tintin: The Complete Companion . Since Tintin's creation in 1929, the books have sold more than 200m 
copies worldwide in more than 50 languages. On The Go hopes this huge fanbase will drive sales and enable it to 
launch more destinations in the near future. www.onthegotours.com 
SHANGHAIIn a city known for huge high-tech hotels, the opening next weekend of the boutique Waterhouse at 
South Bund should provide welcome variety. The 19-room property, housed in a newly-converted 1930s building, 
has been created by Peng Loh, a former lawyer turned hotelier from Singapore, who has just opened the Town Hall 
Hotel in east London. He is hoping the Waterhouse will give guests more of a sense of the city's culture than they 
might get at bigger hotels, and offers tours of Shanghai's old city by bicycle or vintage motor scooter and sidecar. 
The restaurant will be run by Jason Atherton, formerly chef patron at Maze in London, and there's a rooftop bar. 
Rooms start at Y1,600 (£158). www.waterhouseshanghai.com 
TIBET The first airline to be based in Tibet is due to start flying by the middle of next year. Tibet Airlines has 
announced plans to run three aircraft and operate flights within China, taking advantage of the booming numbers of 
tourists visiting the autonomous region. Next year will also see construction begin on a new Tibetan airport at 
Nagqu. At an altitude of 4,436m, it will be the world's highest.
ENGLAND One of the country's best-loved seaside piers is up for sale and could be turned into a luxury hotel. 
Southwold Pier in Suffolk was built in 1900 as a landing stage for steam ships bringing tourists from London. 
Gradually shortened by storms and a drifting world war two mine, it was rebuilt in 1999 and now features cafés, 
restaurants and a collection of post-modern arcade machines created by artist Tim Hunkin. Planning permission 
has recently been granted for a five-storey, 30-room luxury hotel to be added to the 190m-long pier, which has an

IRELAND Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline that is the world's biggest carrier in terms of international passenger 
numbers, has raised its baggage charges by up to a third for the peak months of July and August. While seat prices 
have always risen in summer, this is thought to be the first time that baggage charges have been subject to 
seasonal surcharges. The fee for one 15kg bag rises from £30 to £40 per return trip, but charges can mount rapidly: 
a return trip with two cases, one of up to 15kg and one up to 20kg, would cost £260 in baggage charges alone, if 
paid at the airport rather than online. The really bad news for travellers is that where Ryanair leads, other airlines 
tend to follow.

Ryanair and its chief executive Michael O'Leary have "unreservedly apologised" in the High Court to Sir Stelios 
Haji-Ioannou, founder of rival EasyJet   , about a series of advertisements referring to EasyJet's flight on-time 
statistics.
Sir Stelios issued a claim for libel after a Ryanair ad featured his picture, which the High Court heard yesterday was 
"distorted so his nose was elongated in the style of the character Pinocchio and referred to him as 'EasyJet's Mr 
Late Again'."
The ads, which alleged he had lied, were published in two newspapers and on Ryanair's website in January and 
February this year.
Yesterday, in a statement read in open court, Mr O'Leary and Ryanair said they "accept that the advertisements 
should not have been published referring to Sir Stelios" and fully accepted that Sir Stelios "did not lie about the 
matter".
They also "unreservedly apologised" to Sir Stelios for the ad statements "insofar as they related to him personally 
and suggested he was lying".
Ryanair and Mr O'Leary said they accepted "that Sir Stelios is not in any way responsible for EasyJet's 
management's continuing failure to publish weekly details of their on-time stats."
Ryanair has also undertaken not to publish the ads again and will pay Sir Stelios £50,100 damages, which Sir 
Stelios will give to charity. It has also published apologies in ads in two newspapers.
Sir Stelios, a substantial shareholder in EasyJet, yesterday said he had launched legal action because of the "very 
serious allegation" in the ads: "It's because I had to draw the line somewhere. I'm glad I took him on."
Sir Stelios, at the time of the ads a non-executive director of EasyJet, added it was "especially unfair to pick on me" 
as he did not "micromanage EasyJet".

Many big carriers claim the issue has led to an unfairly distorted market, writes Pilita Clark
Body
The world of aircraft finance is normally far more peaceful than the roaring passenger jets it funds.
But it has become embroiled in a debate that has pitted airlines against governments and united rival manufacturers 
amid a tussle over the role governments play in supporting sales of commercial aircraft via their export credit 
agencies (ECA). This support reached unprecedented levels last year as bank financing dried up as a result of the 
credit crunch.
It rose to more than $20bn in 2009, equal to nearly one-third of the total value of all Boeing and Airbus deliveries, 
and almost double the level in 2008.
"The export credit agencies saved the industry," says Polis Polycarpou, vice-president of the aviation division at 
Frankfurt-based DVB Bank, which specialises in transport finance.
As liquidity remains tight the limits on access to the export credit guarantees have upset many of the world's biggest 
airlines, who say it has led to an unfairly distorted market. This is because of a little-known agreement between the 
US and the European Union dating back to the 1980s that limits which airlines can access export financing.
The issue is due to come to a head in coming months and will be on the minds of many of the executives at the 
UK's biennial Farnborough trade fair, which starts this weekend.
Known as the home market rule it prohibits a airlines based in the domestic market of Boeing of the US or Europe's 
Airbus (France, Germany, the UK and Spain) from getting ECA support. Instead these airlines must rely on 
commercial financing, which some complain is more expensive.
Debate over export credit agencies set to come to a head for airlines
These leaves large rivals, such as Dublin-based Ryanair or Dubai's Emirates access to support from the US Export-
Import Bank (Exim) or the three main European agencies: the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department, France's 
Coface and Germany's Hermes
Earlier this year, leading European airlines barred from access to export credits, including Lufthansa, Air France-
KLM and British Airways, began lobbying their respective governments to tackle the rule.
"This was never an issue two or three years ago," says Chris Partridge, a director in Deutsche Bank's asset 
financing and leasing group. "Then, the likes of Lufthansa and BA could get debt rates which are at the levels 
export credits are today." The dispute has been intensified by the emergence of a rival to Airbus and Boeing's most 
popular single-aisle jets, in the form of Bombardier's planned CSeries aircraft.
Canada never agreed to the home market rule. Nor did potential rivals such as Brazil and China. Boeing and Airbus 
say this is unfair. Bombardier differs. "I think they are trying to protect a favourable position that they have held in 
the market for a long time," says Gary Scott, president of commercial aircraft at Bombardier,
Export credits are expected to take centre stage again this year when Airbus and Boeing, the world's two leading 
aircraft makers, are set to deliver more than 900 passenger jets between them in 2010.
The ECAs stepped in at the start of the credit crunch amid fears that orders would be cancelled leaving hundreds of 
so-called "white tails", aircraft abandoned by their buyers with no new customer.
The notion of forced sales depressing asset values spread during the financial crisis, when the number of banks 
open for aircraft financing business dwindled from about 40 or 50 to "a handful", says Mr Polycarpou. By early 
2009, DVB estimated the so-called "funding gap", the difference between the total value of commercial jet aircraft to 
be delivered and the amount of money likely to be raised to pay for them, was set to reach $17bn.
By year end revised analysis showed a significant drop in the number and value of aircraft deliveries but the white 
tails did not emerge. This year DVB fears the industry still faces a potential funding gap of around $7bn.
The manufacturers dispute this figure.
"I love DVB, they're one of the smartest guys in the aircraft financing world, but this is an area where we have had 
fun duelling," says Kostya Zolotusky, managing director capital markets at Boeing Capital.
"They were predicting in 2009 there would be clouds of white tails and huge funding gaps, and then when that didn't 
happen, everyone said 'Well, the real problem is going to be in 2010'. Well, the data we're looking at continues to 
say things are better than they were a year ago."
Airbus agrees. "Essentially, we foresee no funding gap in 2010," says Nigel Taylor, head of customer finance at 
Airbus, which thinks ECA will again cover a third of its deliveries in 2010.
Whether the manufacturers are right, airlines are still pushing for access to export credit, including those affected by 
the home market rule. The issue has spilt over into separate negotiations being held through the OECD on ECA 
funding terms, which are due to be finalised by the end of the year.

Body
Irish budget airline Ryanair said Thursday it has agreed to pay libel damages to the founder of rival carrier easyJet 
for falsely accusing him of suppressing reports about the company's performance.
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou sued Ryanair because of ads which accused him of stopping publication of weekly reports 
on easyJet's on-time performance. One ad, which showed Stelios with a long nose, called on him to "stop hiding the 
truth."
Stelios was no longer in management at easyJet, but was a non-executive director and major shareholder.
When Stelios protested, Ryanair ran more ads proposing to settle the issue by a sumo wrestling match or a foot 
race, and calling Stelios a "chicken."
The ads were published in The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and on Ryanair's website in January and February.
Chris Scott, a lawyer representing Stelios, said in court that Ryanair and its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, 
accepted that Stelios did not lie, had unreservedly apologized and agreed to pay damages and his legal costs.
"This was an unpleasant personal attack on me by a large public company, made worse by the way O'Leary 
responded to the legal complaints," Stelios said in a statement. He was not in court Thursday.
Stelios' representatives said Ryanair had offered 50,100 pounds ($64,200), which Stelios had accepted and would 
donate to his philanthropic foundation.

Irish shares have dipped in early trade this morning, in line with a negative trend on other markets.
European shares have on the whole edged lower, led by banks, as investors stay cautious.
Minutes of the US Federal Reserve's June meeting yesterday showed that officials were concerned with the pace of 
economic recovery.
And new figures from China have shown that growth there has also eased. The ISEQ index of Irish shares was 
down 7.31 points a short time ago at 2,939.48. The two big banks have slipped, as uncertainty continues about the 
outcome of stress tests on their reserves. AIB and Bank of Ireland are both down by 2c, to 88 and 72 respectively. 
CRH has edged down by 12c to 1634, with Ryanair down 5c to 383 and Aryzta off by 2c to 3230. But it wasn't all

Ryanair has once again been rapped on the knuckles by an industry watchdog for allegedly misleading customers.
Two national press adverts for the budget airline offered £10 one-way fares to Gothenburg and Dusseldorf, with 
small print explaining that the offer was subject to availability and excluded optional fees and charges.
Rival EasyJet challenged the availability of the fares and queried if they included taxes, charges and check-in fees 
or were misleading because the advert did not state the relevant travel dates.
Defending the advert, Ryanair said more than 10,000 seats were available to Gothenburg and more than 22,000 
seats were on offer to Dusseldorf. More than half the seats sold to Gothenburg and more than 40pc of seats sold to 
Dusseldorf during the four-day sale were booked at a lower £5 promotional fare, and the fares in the adverts 
included all taxes, charges and non-discretionary fees. The airline added that there was no requirement for 
advertisers to include the specific travel dates for offers, but said the campaign was for flights between January 1 to 
February 28 this year. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said readers were likely to believe that the £10 
deal was a fixed price. The ASA said: "Because we considered that consumers would understand "£10 one way" to 
mean that all flights to Gothenburg and Dusseldorf-Weeze were available at £10, and because we had not seen 
evidence to support that claim, we concluded that the ads were likely to mislead." It told Ryanair to ensure that all 
seats were available at the quoted fare or to state prominently that seats were available "from" a particular price.

A new maintenance business that rose from the ashes of SR Technics' Dublin operations has won a major contract 
from Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus.
From November, Dublin Aerospace will service 12 Airbus A320s for the airline, while Sabena Technics will perform 
Aer Lingus' remaining base maintenance at its Bordeaux facilities.
Dublin Aerospace's biggest shareholder is Conor McCarthy, a former Ryanair chief operating officer and Aer Lingus 
Commuter chief executive, who is also a director of AirAsia and of Mexico's VivaAerobus.
After SR Technics' decision to close its overhaul operation in the Irish capital - revealed in 2009 - McCarthy raised 
investment of $25 million so that selected assets could be acquired from the Mubadala-owned MRO giant.
The team of investors included AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes, Airbus parent EADS, Enterprise Ireland and 
aircraft technical consultancy Santos Dumont.
Dublin Aerospace purchased a maintenance base that included a hangar to accommodate three narrowbodies, as 
well as landing gear and auxiliary power unit workshops. It set up four business units: narrowbody aircraft 
overhauls, with the focus on the A320 and Boeing 737 families; landing gear overhauls, where 737 capability is due 
to be supplemented by A320 capability from December; APU servicing; and technical training.

AIRBUS OUTPUT DOWN, ORDERS UP
HALF YEAR Airbus delivered 250 aircraft over the first half of 2010, while the recent landmark Emirates deal for 32 
A380s took its six-month gross order total to 131. Cancellations of six A330s and eight A320-family jets brought the 
net figure to 117, compared with 68 for the same period last year. Airbus is slightly behind its 2009 delivery rate at 
the halfway point. The airframer delivered 254 aircraft in the first six months of last year.
INDIA AND MALAYSIA EXPLORE AIR LIBERALISATION
DISCUSSION India and Malaysia have begun talks to liberalise their air services agreement as part of a bid to 
promote tourism and business links. "There are opportunities in other Indian cities where our airlines can operate," 
says Malaysian transport minister Kong Cho Ha, "and we invite more Indian airlines to fly to Malaysia."
ORION COMPLETES SAFETY REVIEW
SPACEFLIGHT Lockheed Martin's Orion crew exploration vehicle has completed NASA's Phase 1 safety review 
and now moves into a Phase 2 review. The space capsule is scheduled for critical design review completion in 
2011 and orbit in 2013.
EU BROADENS OPERATING BAN ON IRAN AIR
RESTRICTIONS The European Union has expanded its "blacklist" restrictions on Iran Air to include a ban on 
operations to Europe by the carrier's Airbus A320s, Boeing 727s and 747s. In its March "blacklist", the European 
Commission had allowed Iran Air operations into Europe by 18 Airbus A300/A310s, nine 747s, six A320s and a 
single Boeing 737, but extended the ban after ramp check results on the carrier's A320s were found to be 
"noticeably worse" than those for other aircraft in its fleet.
COURT UPHOLDS AER LINGUS TAKEOVER BAN
INTRODUCTION:
RULING Europe's General Court upheld a European Commission bar on Ryanair taking over Aer Lingus, but stood 
firm on refusing to order the Irish budget carrier to divest its 29.3% shareholding in its rival. Three years ago, the 
Commission stopped Ryanair's planned takeover, deeming it "incompatible with the common market".
A350 PYLON COMPONENT WORK GOES TO MAGELLAN
AIRLINERS Airbus has selected the UK division of Magellan Aerospace to manufacture pylon body aluminium 
detail components for the A350. The work, to be carried out in Bournemouth and Wrexham, will be worth $60 
million over the next decade.
ANTONOV AND UAC SEE JOINT VENTURE BY OCTOBER
PACT United Aircraft and Antonov are aiming to complete formation of an intermediate 50:50 joint venture over the 
next three months. The two sides plan to set up a common marketing firm to sell Antonov types including the An-
140, An-148, An-124 and probably the An-70 and work out ways to further integrated the companies.
GARUDA IPO TO BE HELD BY END OF 2010
PRIVATISATION Garuda Indonesia hopes to launch its initial public offer later this year, says chief executive 
Emirsyah Satar, who adds that the Indonesian government will decide on the percentage of the carrier to be floated 
after an underwriter is found. He has said previously that up to 40% of the carrier could be offered. Garuda's plans 
for an IPO are part of a five-year turnaround plan.

Porto's pleasure cruise
Porto's pleasure cruise
Sunday Business Post

Section: AGENDA
Length: 1065 words
Body
The city of Porto sits at the open mouth of the Duoro river, the fertile banks of which provide the rich soil that 
anchors the best of Portuguese and Spanish wine.
Known throughout the English speaking world as Oporto (an 18th-century misnomer that stuck), Porto is also the 
home of port wine, with its famed production houses lining the left-hand side of the city's riverbank.
Port is also an accident of the city's English-speaking connections.
British sailors who found that the wine they had exported back to England had soured on the journey, added a little 
brandy to their next shipment of cargo to preserve the wine.
The experiment worked, giving this little jewel of a city its name and its 19th century wealth.
Today, Porto is a palimpsest of its past. Since the 1950s, the city has slowly spread outwards to engulf the coastline 
and the centre has fallen into disrepair.
Along the waterfront, tall tiled houses collapse in on themselves, and balconies are strung with laundry, the city's 
intimate privacies exposed to the heat.
Across the river in Villa Nova de Gaia, where the port is made, bright letters spell out competing logos of port wines: 
Sandeman, Taylor's, Churchill's - the British names a reminder of the city's trading past.
Despite the somewhat decrepit air, regional traditions are charmingly preserved here. On the last day of college 
term in early May, the streets in the city centre are closed down and locals line the pavements, while robed and 
rowdy students sing and chant their way through the city.
This centuries-old ritual continues well into the early hours of the morning.
Porto's pleasure cruise
Nearly all the restaurants, meanwhile, serve traditional dishes rather than tourist fare. This includes baccalau, a 
tough salted codfish that is popular throughout the country, and porco a' Alentejana, or stewed pork with clams.
The streets remain largely unmarked by the invasion of British and American chainstores you see in other 
European countries.
The chief pleasures of the town are historical (eclectic baroque cathedrals with blue and white tiled facades), and 
gastronomic (eating and drinking remains cheap even in the main tourist area down by the river front), while the 
nightlife at weekends - still stag-free, despite frequent Ryanair flights - spills out across the streets in the Galleria de 
Paris throughout the night.
A ramshackle city, Porto is more notable as a gateway for the lush landscape of northern Portugal and the Douro 
Valley. The valley has been preserved as a Unesco heritage site, which remains wild and undeveloped despite 
being easily accessible to the mass tourist market during the harvest season in September.
The roads through the area are impossibly steep, if not downright dangerous; the few cars that do venture upwards 
through the valley (and they are mostly local or tour buses) cling to the road, the verge entirely exposed.
However, the heart of the valley at the small towns of Regua and Pinhao, is accessible from Porto by boat or steam 
train, offering less dramatic ways to experience the stunning landscape.
Travel companies offer day trips from the city -  80 for the day-long cruise, including breakfast and lunch - but it is 
worth trying to spend a night in the peace of the valley.
The valley is ripe with vineyards and it is here that you will find the real value of the Duoro. Quinta Nova and Quinta 
da Pacheca are two of the many vineyards here that offer accommodation, their sophisticated conversion of 
traditional buildings reflecting the type of client likely to enjoy the combination of wine-tasting and walking that the 
area offers.
Quinta Nova has several walking trails which follow the stepped terraces of the vineyard, and their stunning outdoor 
terrace pool offers entirely unspoilt views of the valley. Dinners at both of the vineyards offer food and wine 
experiences too, with cool white port aperitifs and digestifs, as well as a vintage port served with dessert.
Heading back towards Porto, the small historical city of Guimareas, which will be European Capital of Culture in 
2012, makes for a pleasant, peaceful diversion.
The city offers a unique mix of baroque and rococo architecture. It is best viewed from a converted monastery, the 
Pousada de Santa Marinha da Costa, a historic hotel that offers on one side incredible views of an unspoilt rolling 
countryside, and on the other a full panorama of the city. Nearby Braga, its twin town and chief rival, literally sprawls 
across the other side of the hill.
The impressive shrine of Bom Jesu, which can be seen from every street corner in the historical centre of the 
industrial textile town, is stepped deeply into the mountain.
Fatima aside, Bom Jesu is the country's most famous shrine and it remains a popular point of pilgrimage.
It is on the Camino way, 200 kilometres south of Santiago de Compostela, but it also receives local visitors who 
come to light candles or to walk or lunch in the nature park behind the cathedral.
There are four hotels surrounding the shrine, all of which serve food throughout the day.
The Hotel do Elevador, named after the cable car which runs up from the city below, is the oldest hotel on the site 
and has impressive views from its glass-fronted restaurant.
Heading back to Porto, the beach beckons if you have enough time.
Porto's pleasure cruise
The city centre is within walking distance (25-30 minutes), or ten minutes by bus or metro.
Once here, the several excellent beaches in the city's salubrious suburbs can be easily identified by the large 
number of five-star hotels, such as the 14-floor Sheraton, that sit side-by-side with garden-sheltered villas.
On our trip, the action from the Eyjafjallajkull volcano scuppers our direct flights so that the quickest way home is 
via the Roman walled town of Girona, a mere 90 minutes by plane, where you can fly to London several times a 
day, and pick up a train and eventually a ferry back to Dublin.

Ryan seed fund to boost budding tech firms

A new  1 million seed venture fund for technology start-up companies is to be announced by Dublin City University's 
Ryan Academy this week.
The fund is being financed by the charity One Foundation, which is funded by businessman Declan Ryan, son of 
Ryanair founder Tony Ryan.
A university-related venture fund for start-ups across Ireland, it also offers a programme of support for the 
businesses through the Ryan Academy and its network, which will help new companies develop from concept to 
product. Its aim is to jump-start a number of high-tech companies with an emphasis on software and biotechnology 
hardware such as medical devices and diagnostics.
The successful companies will get around  50,000 in direct funding, as well as a three-month programme of support 
from the Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship at DCU. This will include office space, mentorship and specially-
designed networking and educational programmes.
Any profits generated by the fund will be returned for further investment.
DCU's president-designate Brian MacCraith said it was an important initiative for Ireland that addressed ''an 
obvious deficit in the pathway from concept to successful product''.
The first round of investment will open for applicants in October and the first four successful entrepreneurs will be 
announced before the end of the year.
Another eight entrepreneurs will be funded in 2011 and the same number in 2012.
The Ryan Academy is aiming to work with other seed funds and individual investors, and will be seeking to increase 
the fund size over time.
Ryan seed fund to boost budding tech firms
''Raising the money to get through the first year is often difficult for entrepreneurs and our objective is to support 20 
early-stage entrepreneurial teams over the next two and a half years," said Gordon McConnell, deputy chief 
executive of the Ryan Academy and venture manager for the new fund.
The new fund will be governed by a technology advisory board, which will be announced later in the summer. The 
Ryan Academy is a partnership between DCU and the family of the late Tony Ryan.

Ryanair
Ryanair said it would not rule out making a third bid for its Irish rival, Aer Lingus, in spite of a court ruling on 
Tuesday that Europe's leading competition authorities were correct to block its attempt to take over the national 
airline nearly three years ago.
The European General Court, one of Europe's top courts, upheld the European Commission's decisions in that 
case and a separate one brought by Aer Lingus, which was trying to get the Commission to order Ryanair to sell its 
29.8 per cent stake in the carrier.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the ruling would not stop a future offer for Aer Lingus, though 
"obviously any such offer will have to take account of the court's detailed ruling".
"Ryanair has no immediate plans to make a third offer for Aer Lingus," Mr O'Leary said, adding that any such move 
would be unlikely to succeed unless the Irish government sold its 25 per cent stake in the flag carrier.
Ryanair remains both the fiercest adversary of and largest shareholder in Aer Lingus.
Mr O'Leary regularly predicts that Aer Lingus will go out of business and on Monday described it as "a small, 
peripheral regional airline" with large losses and declining traffic, fleet and staff numbers.
Babcock/VT Group
Babcock International completed its £1.4bn takeover of rival VT Group this week, creating one of the UK's biggest 
engineering support services companies.
VT shareholders were offered 361.1p in cash, and 0.701 Babcock shares for each VT share, and VT shareholders 
were invited to "mix and match" the proportion of shares and cash they received.
The big stories
Peter Rogers, Babcock chief executive, said the new group would be able to take advantage of increased 
outsourcing work from the Ministry of Defence as it it offered engineering support services in defence, nuclear and 
critical infrastructure.
On Thursday the group issued a bullish market update, saying trading remained robust with a £8.3bn order book.
The enlarged company began trading on Friday with a market value of £2.8bn.
Celador
The UK's Celador Entertainment this week won its six-year court battle against Disney, which has been ordered to 
pay the group damages of $270m (£178m).
The dispute arose over disagreements regarding Celador's share of the profits generated by the TV show Who 
Wants to be a Millionaire? , which was sold by Celador to Disney in 1998.
Paul Smith, chairman of Celador, told the Financial Times that his group was entitled to 50 per cent of the profits 
generated by the show, but regular payments by Disney were lower than anticipated.
After amicable discussions with Disney failed to resolve the matter, Celador launched court proceedings in 2004.
Disney plans to appeal against the ruling, which was reached by a California district court, and said the verdict was 
"fundamentally wrong".

Today's announcement from Ryanair that it is to cut its Winter service from Dublin is for its own strategic reasons 
and has nothing to do with airport charges, according to the Dublin Airport Authority.
Ryanair earlier today said that its Dublin base this winter will be cut from 14 aircraft (2009) to 12 aircraft (in 2010) 
and Ryanair will operate less than 850 weekly flights from Dublin compared to 1,000 last winter.
It said that figures show that the only two countries in Europe that have a travel tax, Ireland and Britain, also had the 
only declines in passenger numbers with traffic at Dublin Airport down by some 30pc from 23.5m in 2008 to under 
17m in 2010, which is less than 2004 traffic levels at Dublin.
Ryanair wants the Government to scrap the E10 tourist tax and Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) to transfer the new 
Terminal 2 building to NAMA, which it says would help reduce passenger charges. "Ryanair's own business model 
and the wider economic position has contributed to the airline's decision to withdraw these services. These 
decisions are not related to passenger charges at Dublin Airport, which is one of Europe's most competitively priced 
large airports. Dublin's current passenger charge for 2010 is 25pc lower than the average E12.50 passenger charge 
levied in 2008 by comparable European airports such as Stansted, Gatwick, Brussels, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Zurich, 
Vienna, Munich, Oslo," the DAA said.

Ryanair To Cut Dublin Winter Capacity By 15% - Update

Body
(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said Thursday that it has decided to cut its Dublin winter 
capacity by 15% and has called on the Dublin Airport Authority or DAA to transfer its EUR 1.2 billion T2 white 
elephant to National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), as Dublin Airport traffic continues to decline.
The airline has also called on to reverse the up to 40% increases in passenger charges at Dublin Airport in 2010.
According to the company, the transfer of the EUR 1.2 billion T2 white elephant to NAMA would allow the DAA to 
reverse the 40% passenger cost increases.
Ryanair said it will cut winter capacity in Dublin to 12 aircraft from 14 aircraft and will be operating less than 850 
weekly flights, down from 1,000 operated last year.
The airline said it called on the government to scrap its EUR 10 tourist tax, as other EU countries have scrapped 
tourist taxes and returned to tourism growth. According to the company, the Irish government imposed the 
passenger tax in April 2009 and since then traffic at Dublin Airport has fallen by some 30%.
The company said it intends to switch its aircraft to other EU countries, where airport charges have been reduced 
and scrapped government tourist taxes.
The airline noted that Ireland continues to lose visitors as it is imposing tourist taxes and raising airport charges. UK 
and Ireland are said to be the two remaining EU countries with tourist taxes and continue to suffer traffic declines.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement, "Ryanair believes that T2 should be transferred to NAMA 
which is a Govt vehicle for working out the debts of reckless property developers, as Ryanair believes that T2 was 
the single most reckless, expensive and unnecessary property development of the entire Celtic tiger years."

Ryanair said it will not rule out making a third bid for Aer Lingus, its Irish rival, in spite of yesterday's court ruling that 
Europe's leading competition authorities were correct to block its attempt to take over the national airline nearly 
three years ago.
The European General Court, one of Europe's top courts, upheld the European Commission's decisions in that 
case and a separate one brought by Aer Lingus, which was trying to get the Commission to order Ryanair to sell its 
29.8 per cent stake in its rival.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the ruling would not stop a future offer for Aer Lingus, but "obviously 
any such offer will have to take account of the court's detailed ruling".
"Ryanair has no immediate plans to make a third offer for Aer Lingus," he said, adding that any move would be 
unlikely to succeed unless the Irish government sold its 25 per cent stake in the flag carrier.
The rulings leave Ireland's two leading airlines in much the same state of uncertainty that they have faced since 
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, rocked Ireland's business establishment with its bid for Aer Lingus in 2006, 
valued at EUR2.80 a share.
The move failed after the European Commission ruled in 2007 that it would have led to a nearmonopoly in the Irish 
market and would have damaged the interests of passengers - the only time the Commission has blocked a 
European airline merger.
A second bid by Ryanair in 2008 at EUR1.40 a share failed after the Irish government, Aer Lingus's second- largest 
shareholder, said it undervalued the airline.
Ryanair, which reported a EUR341m (£284m) pre-tax profit and 66.5m passengers in its most recent annual 
results, remains both the most fierce adversary of and largest shareholder in Aer Lingus, which in its annual results 
reported a pre-tax loss of EUR154m and carried 10m passengers.
Ryanair still has Aer Lingus in its sights
Mr O'Leary regularly predicts that Aer Lingus will go out of business and described it yesterday as "a small 
peripheral regional airline" with falling traffic, fleet, jobs and large losses.
Aer Lingus has argued that having its largest rival owning such a large stake has dragged down the share price - 
because liquidity in stock is limited - and hampered attempts to forge strategic alliances with other airlines.
Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus chairman, said yesterday: "It is regrettable that the court has not taken this opportunity 
to take the further step necessary to address the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer 
Lingus, which is contrary to the interests of the majority of our shareholders."
Joaquin Almunia, European Union competition commissioner, welcomed the court's confirmation of the 
Commission's decision, saying the merger of the Irish airlines would have created a dominant position on 35 routes, 
to the detriment of more than 14m European passengers travelling to and from Ireland annually.
Commission officials said they took particular heart from the court's endorsement of the way the effects of airline 
mergers on individual, overlapping routes were analysed and their approach to remedies.
Lawyers for Ryanair, however, claimed that the Commission had benefited from a "wide margin of discretion" and 
said it was disappointing that the court had not placed more emphasis on "the competitive forces of a liberalised air 
transport market".
Ryanair shares rose 7 cents to EUR3.74, while Aer Lingus shares were steady at 83 cents yesterday.

A European Union court ruled Tuesday that antitrust regulators were right to block Ryanair's hostile 2007 bid for 
rival Irish airline Aer Lingus.
The General Court, the EU's second-highest judicial authority, also backed the European Commission's refusal to 
order Ryanair to sell off the 29.8 percent stake it accumulated in Aer Lingus, which makes it the largest shareholder 
in the airline.
Aer Lingus is demanding that they force Ryanair to offload its shares and says it will consider an appeal to the EU's 
highest court.
Aer Lingus' chairman Colm Barrington said Ryanair's minority stake was causing "anti-competitive effects" and was 
"contrary to the interests of the majority of our shareholders."
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said the Tuesday ruling "will not prevent Ryanair making a future offer for Aer 
Lingus" but he had no immediate plans to launch a third takeover effort because it would be unlikely to succeed 
unless the Irish government sold its 25 percent stake.
"We continue to believe that the long-term financial viability of Aer Lingus can only be secured as part of one strong 
Irish airline group, particularly when the rest of Europe's airlines are consolidating," he said.
The European Commission rarely blocks takeovers but refused to allow Ryanair's hostile (EURO)1.48 billion ($1.85 
billion) takeover, saying it would create a monopoly for flights from Dublin airport. It was only the second time in five 
years that it stopped a deal.
Airline takeovers in Europe can face a rough ride with regulators due to the high market share and the number of 
takeoff and landing slots that many carriers hold in their home country.
The EU's executive said the ruling made it clear that companies have to put forward their own solutions to eliminate 
competition worries "in due time." Ryanair finally made some concessions under EU pressure but the court agreed 
with regulators that they were too little, too late.
EU court backs ban on Ryanair bid
Lufthansa sold off some airport takeover and landing slots to rivals to win separate EU approvals to buy Austrian 
Airlines and Brussels Airlines last year.
Regulators are currently assessing British Airways PLC's merger with Spain's Iberia SA which will create Europe's 
third largest airline. They are due to approve it by July 15 or open a longer investigation.
They must also rule on United Airline's merger with Continental by July 27. Separately they will examine a deal 
between Greece's Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines SA by July 30
Only the EU courts can overrule antitrust regulators but they found no fault with the decision to block the Ryanair 
bid, saying officials did a careful analysis of the harm to competition for the 14 million passengers who fly with the 
airlines to and from Ireland each year.

partner then we believe it is doomed to fail because it can't compete with Ryanair's low fares, customer service or 
scale," Mr O'Leary said.

Body
Europe's second-highest court today upheld a decision by EU regulators to block a plan by Ryanair to buy Aer 
Lingus three years ago, saying there had been valid concerns about the deal.
However, the court said that Ryanair's 29.9pc stake in Aer Lingus is valid from a competition point of view.
The General Court was ruling on an appeal by Ryanair against the European Commission's rejection of its takeover 
bid and on an appeal by Aer Lingus against the watchdog's dismissal of its request to order that Ryanair divest its 
Aer Lingus stake.
The Commission, the 27-country European Union's competition enforcer, said in its 2007 decision that the 
combined carriers would be dominant on many routes, marking its second veto of a merger in four years. "Those 
dominant positions are monopolistic or very significant and are sufficient, in themselves, to validate the 
Commission's finding that the ... merger must be declared incompatible with the common market," a court 
statement said. On Aer Lingus' appeal, it said the Commission had legal and factual justification not to order 
Ryanair to sell its shares in the Irish former state carrier after the bid failed. Antitrust lawyers said the verdict of the 
Luxembourg-based court followed a general trend seen in previous cases. "No one will be surprised by today's 
judgment," said Paul McGeown, a partner at Hunton and Williams. "The court allows the Commission considerable 
leeway in assessing the commitments offered to address competition worries, and in this case, Ryanair simply flew 
too close to the sun, offering too little, too late," he said.

(RTTNews) - Tuesday,General Court of the European union in Luxembourg rejected Ryanair plc's (RYA.L) appeal 
against the prohibition of its takeover bid for the Irish carrier Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L). Further, justifying 
european commission's decision, the court allowed Ryanair to hold its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.
In 2007, low-cost airline Ryanair launched a hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus. However, that was vetoed by the 
European Commission saying the acquisition is incompatible with the common market.
Pronouncing the decision, the General Court noted that none of the arguments put forwarded by Ryanair is capable 
of calling into question the findings made by the commission. The court referred the decision of the European 
commission that the merger would significantanly impede effective competition on a number of routes, especially on 
Dublin, Cork and Shannon routes.
Aer Lingus welcomed the judgement and said the decision confirms the European Commission's findings that 
consumers would be harmed by such a takeover.
Following the privatisation of Aer Lingus in 2006 by the Irish government, Ryanair acquired a 19.16% stake. On 
October 2006 Ryanair launched a public bid for the entire share capital of Aer Lingus and notified the EU 
Commission, the EU's antitrust regulator, of the proposed acquisition in accordance with the Community Merger 
Regulation. Ryanair further acquired Aer Lingus shares during the bid period and by November 2006 held 25.17% 
of the share capital.
The European Commission opened a detailed investigation into the planned acquisition under the EU Merger 
Regulation in December 2006. On June 27, 2007, the European Commission prohibited the proposed takeover 
saying the acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from Ireland which currently compete 
vigorously against each other. The Commission concluded that the merger would have harmed consumers by 
removing competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties.
Aer Lingus said it would consider appeal regarding the Court's rejection of its appeal over Commission's refusal to 
force Ryanair to divest existing stake, after considering judgement in detail.
The Commission in a decision of October 2007, stated that it was not within its power to order such a divestiture. In 
today's decision, the Court noted that the Commission justified to the required legal and factual standards in its 
decision not to order Ryanair to divest its shareholding.

Midwest's 737-600 was the second NG to be disassembled after a Ryanair 737-800
Aircraft waiting for break-up at Kemble airport in the UK

Eyebrows were raised when an 11-year-old Boeing 737-600 was sold for parting out earlier this year. More 
worrisome for the market was the disassembly of a two-year old Ryanair 737-800 that had been damaged in a 
landing accident.
Most airliners are destined to end their days in the scrapyard, but these were the first disassemblies of 737 Next 
Generation aircraft, an in-production type that entered service as recently as 1997.
Both these twinjets were inducted by aircraft recycling and dismantling specialist Air Salvage International (ASI) at 
its facility at Kemble airfield in the UK, which is also known as Cotswold airport.
The Ryanair aircraft suffered a multiple bird-strike when landing at Rome Ciampino airport in November 2008. 
Although it landed safely, the undercarriage was badly damaged. ASI's managing director Mark Gregory says that 
the jet was dismantled in Rome and parts have been ferried back to the Kemble facility by road.
So while it was apparently an insurance-based decision to retire the 737-800, the scrapping of the 737-600 - which 
is the smallest and least popular member of the twinjet family - was driven by economics. There are currently just 
68 -600s in service.

A318 PARTING OUT
Last year saw the first parting out of an ex-Frontier Airbus A318, the newest A320 family variant that entered 
service as recently as 2003 and which has a similar fleet size to the 737-600, with just 72 in operation.
There is a range of aircraft becoming increasingly expensive to operate in the current economic environment and 
owners are reaching the conclusion that parting them out generates more than keeping them in operation through a 
lease contract.
The International Bureau of Aviation (IBA) handled the sale of the 737-600, which belonged to the administrators of 
defunct carrier FlyGlobespan. It had originally been delivered to Scandinavian Airlines.
"We were surprised by the amount of bidders, mainly tear-down companies," says IBA's commercial director Owen 
Geach.
"The failure of FlyGlobespan presented some interesting remarketing projects. With the 737-600 having an 
operating base that remains all too dominated by Air Algerie, Malév, SAS, Tunisair and WestJet, it seemed 
apparent that other avenues had to be explored. Part-out to realise the value in the engines and airframe was too 
tempting," Geach adds.
Flightglobal's ACAS database lists 2,340 jet airliners as being permanently retired over the past 10 years with 70% 
being narrowbodies (see graphic).
IBA conservatively forecasts that more than 3,500 aircraft will be parked across the 10-year span. The bureau 
expects an estimated 1,500 parked aircraft to come from the North American fleets, while it believes that European 
aircraft will total 810 units.
"You will see an increasing number of MD-80s, 737s, 757s and A320s heading for part-out as they get replaced by 
newer-technology aircraft," says Geach.
While the 737-600/800 disassemblies could be one-off transactions, just as the first A318 part-out last year, more 
ageing A320s are due to head to the scrapyard.
The appraiser and consultancy firm says that between 10 and 14 A320 aircraft a year will be part-out candidates 
over the next five years. Among them are the older aircraft operated by major European carriers such as Air 
France, British Airways and Iberia.
While the airlines business is cyclical, the dismantling and recycling has been one of the few booming sectors of the 
aviation industry. For Gregory, breaking up an aircraft is the owner's last resort. "Obviously owners would rather see 
their aircraft in the skies," he says, adding that economics push them to look at "other alternatives".
Inevitably aircraft reach an age at which airlines find them too old and inefficient to be operated cost-effectively.
"When looking at selling or leasing aircraft, you have to consider age restrictions in some countries," points out IBA. 
"The 20-year rule in some countries, such as the Middle East, or 15-year Chinese or Russian cap can influence 
part-out decisions."
Age is a major consideration, but IBA points out that the engine condition is a key element in the aircraft owner's 
final decision. While aircraft seats, television screens and reading lights can be sold at almost no cost, the value is 
more in the engines, landing gear and avionics.
IBA adds that attracting financing for used aircraft is rare. "There is a paradox at the moment. Many airlines don't 
have the financial strength to purchase new aircraft and refinancing older aircraft is difficult." In many cases selling 
an aircraft is the best option.
TALKING SCRAPTo fly no more INTRODUCTION: Why are more - and newer - aircraft heading for the 
scrapyard to be parted out?
SPARES DEMAND
In addition, demand for spares has grown for engine parts as operators see opportunities to keep aircraft on wing 
longer, without sending engines through a shop visit. IBA also notes a significant interest from engine traders rather 
than placing orders with engine manufacturers for spare engines.
Figures produced by IBA provide evidence of a fall in prices for passenger aircraft. A 20-year-old A320 has a 
market value of $8.3 million, says IBA, 20% down on the $10.3 million it was worth a year ago. However, for the 
tear-down market the aircraft will probably be sold for between $6 million and $7 million according to the firm. Of 
this, the part-out companies will probably receive between $1.5 million and $2 million per engine.
IBA says the 737 Classic is more affected than the A320 mode as its market is plummeting. A 20-year-old 737-400 
now has a market value of $5.5 million, but in the tear-down market the value would drop to $3 million.
The 737 Classic makes up the bulk of the aircraft meeting their end at Kemble, notably three ex-KLM twinjets as 
well as two ex-KD Avia aircraft at different stages of part-out.
GROWING BUSINESS
But this year will see more A320s joining the field, predicts Gregory. "The A320 market is a growing business for 
us," he says.
Over the past two years the company has dismantled six aircraft of the type. This year, ASI is dismantling two ex-
Air France and one ex-Nouvelair Tunisie aircraft and has two more scheduled to arrive.
On an average good year, the company dismantles 20 aircraft. In 2009, ASI parted out 25 aircraft, but Gregory 
believes that this year that total will reach 30.
The paradox is that ASI had more aircraft to break up but fewer parts are being taken out.
According to Gregory, 80% of an A320 can be reused in the market place. On a typical Classic, the company would 
have taken out 1,500 line replaceable units five years ago. Today, the same aircraft will only need 300 items out. 
"The list has shrunk along with the market requirement. Fewer parts are required by operators and most of these 
aircraft end up for scrap," he says.
Gregory says that only 60% of Classic aircraft are now being recycled. "The popularity of the Classics in the current 
market is not great and the longer owners wait, the less they tend to get."
The 737-600 dismantling should be completed by the end of July.
Gregory believes that as many as 1,800 parts will be taken out of the aircraft because the secondhand market for 
the 737-600 model is limited. "The cabin interior will probably be used again," he adds.

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet Plc (EZJ.L) revealed Tuesday that both load factor and number of 
passengers traveled in June improved year over year.
Load factor, or the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for passengers, in June 
was 87.2%, up 0.9 percentage points from 86.3% in the same month last year.
In the month, the airline's passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, grew 9.4% to 4.53 million 
from 4.14 million in the preceding year.
For the rolling twelve months ended June, passengers carried increased 7% year-over-year to 47.63 million from 
44.53 million, and load factor improved 1.5 percentage points to 86.7% from 85.2% a year ago.
Passenger figures represent the number of earned seats flown including seats that are flown whether or not the 
passenger turns up; and seats provided for promotional purposes and to staff for business travel.
June passenger statistics also marks a sequential improvement. In May, load factor was 85.8% and the airline 
carried 4.26 million passengers.
Among peers, low fare airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported Monday June passenger traffic of 
6.71 million, a 15% growth year-over-year. However, load factor for the month dropped 1% to 84%.
Larger peer British Airways Plc (BAY.L, BAIRY.PK) Monday reported a decline in traffic, capacity and load factor for 
the month of June, as industrial action by the Unite union, representing cabin crews, affected the first nine days of 
the month.
EZJ.L is currently trading at 399 pence, up 7 pence or 1.79%, on the LSE.

If you own a house abroad, you don't have holidays any more. You go to your house and work harder than you do 
at home, keeping everything ship-shape and catering for guests. When you get back, you need a holiday. But there 
is this other rather brilliant thing going on: your sentimental love for a place you've made your own, against 
strangely significant odds, increases year on year. In the English winters, I dream about our French swimming pool, 
and the delicious, repetitive coming and going from kitchen to sunlit terrace, and the sound of nightingales at dusk.
I'm doing research for my new novel, which will be the sequel to Restoration , so I'll take as many books on the late 
17th century as I feel my head will tolerate. These will be cut with some obligatory reading in French - Maupassant, 
Balzac and possibly JMG le Clézio - and also by some new American fiction, Joyce Carole Oates's Little Bird of 
Heaven and Jonathan Franzen's Freedom .
I do a ton of cooking in France, where everything - from melon to mussels, from chicken to chickpeas - tastes 
better. But there are also a couple of adorable local restaurants, where we sink into familiar chairs and wait for 
familiar greetings and for simple splendours to arrive.
Long ago, I loved air travel: one whiff of airport diesel and my heart beat faster. Now, I loathe and detest almost 
everything associated with flying, from start to exhausted finish. We used to fly Ryanair (that blue-and-yellow plastic 
purgatory) to Nîmes. Now, we go by train to Avignon and this swift ride through France is a fine and enjoyable thing.
Richard Holmes, my partner, is my ideal travelling companion. He stays calm and good-natured. He always knows 
which way north lies. He's stoical with difficult crosswords.
If I couldn't travel with him, I think I'd choose Prince Charles and get the benefit of some topiary tips from him as the 
Rolls-Royce purred along or the helicopter lifted off.
As children, my sister and I were taken to France when we were very young and my love affair with that country 
began then, on dusty picnics, in the smell of oysters, in the complicated rhythms of the language. Now, I don't really 
want to go anywhere else.

Irish shares took another hit today... this time from worries about the global recovery.
The ISEQ fell by 82.12 points to 2,796.55, mirroring retreats on other exchanges around the globe after new data 
showed a slowdown in the Chinese economy.
The new figures showed the pace of Chinese manufacturing growth slowing in June as the government acted to 
cool the property market and curb bank lending.
With strong growth in China remaining the best hope of keeping the global recovery on track, the slowdown there 
was taken as bad news for us all. The market's mood darkened further in the afternoon, on news that new claims 
for state unemployment aid in the US rose unexpectedly last week, heightening fears the US economic recovery is

Irish shares took another hit today... this time from worries about the global recovery.
The ISEQ fell by 82.12 points to 2,796.55, mirroring retreats on other exchanges around the globe after new data 
showed a slowdown in the Chinese economy.
The new figures showed the pace of Chinese manufacturing growth slowing in June as the government acted to 
cool the property market and curb bank lending.
With strong growth in China remaining the best hope of keeping the global recovery on track, the slowdown there 
was taken as bad news for us all. The market's mood darkened further in the afternoon, on news that new claims 
for state unemployment aid in the US rose unexpectedly last week, heightening fears the US economic recovery is 
stalling. And a purchasing manager's survey from France showed that its manufacturing recovery there eased for a

Irish shares retreated from early gains to end flat this evening, as the market returned to relative calm after this 
week's fear of a banking meltdown.
Worries that banks would run out of money after making repayments tomorrow of 442bn euro to the European 
Central Bank melted away.
But lingering concern that Irish banks will be making a bigger share than most of such repayments held their share 
prices back.
Nobody quite knows how much Irish banks have borrowed from the central bank, by Fitch has estimated that it 
could be as much as 12pc of the ECB's loans to the sector. But the matter is further complicated by uncertainty 
about how much of this might be from the IFSC operations of foreign banks in Dublin. Both AIB and Bank of Ireland 
saw their shares slip back by 1c today, to 88 and 68 respectively. Irish Life and Permanent edged 1c higher to 152. 
Overall the ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the session 0.99 of a point higher at 2,878.67. Shares across Europe 
ended in positive territory on relief that banking worries have eased, at least for now. The Dax index in frankfurt 
ended 0.23pc ahead, with the CAC-40 in Paris up 0.29pc and the Footsie in London up 0.05pc. Industrial shares 
did better than the financials in Dublin today. Building materials group CRH advanced by 41c to 1714. Davy analyst 
Barry Dixon points out that containerboard prices are rising in the US. "At the current price, US prices are higher 
than at any point in the last 10 years," he says. "This will likely encourage European producers to push local prices 
higher." Smurfit Kappa is the largest producer of linerboard in Euroe, selling around half a million tonnes of it per 
year. Grafton shares rose by 7c to 292, following its purchase in Britain of an online supply site for plumbing and 
heating tradesmen. "It is an example of Grafton acquiring a specialist business to expand its product offering," says 
analyst Robert eason of Goodbodys. C&C shares edged 3c higher to 325 after Davy Stockbrokers conducted a 
telephone poll of UK pubs to see how a new advertising campaign for the drink company's Magner cider was going

down. "The majority of respondents said Magners was performing either ahead of, or at least in line with last year," 
says Barry Gallagher of the broking firm. "These results provide evidence that C&C is successfully correcting its 
underperformance in the UK cider category." Ryanair was unchanged at 359, with investors worrying about its 
decision to cut UK winter capaicty by 16pc , mainly from Stansted , but also from Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford, 
because of travel taxes. Analyst Marina Devitt of Goodbodys points out that media reports are also predicting that 
further cuts could be made in Ireland because of the travel tax here. She argues, however, that such cuts could be 
good for Ryanair's bottom line, since they enable the airline to move aircraft to other hubs with cheaper costs , and 
where passenger demand is not being impacted by travel taxes.

News In Brief
## Irish airlines have estimated the cost of meeting claims arising from flight cancellations caused by the Icelandic 
volcanic eruption at more than 71m euros. Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Aer Arann have received almost 1.2 million 
requests for flight refunds and reimbursement of expenses from would-be travellers whose flights were disrupted by 
the ash cloud. Under EU passenger rights rules, airlines must reimburse reasonable expenses incurred by 
passengers affected by volcanic ash. These include hotel and food bills. - Irish Times
## ESB International is poised to jointly develop and operate an 800m euro gas-fired power station in Poland that 
will be the largest such facility in the country when complete. It will be the biggest project to date in the country for 
the state-owned body since the Electricity Supply Board was prevented back in 2001 by the Irish Government from 
acquiring a major stake in a group of eight state-owned Polish electricity firms. It is understood the new venture, 
which will be undertaken in conjunction with state-owned Polish electricity firm Grupa Energa, will involve the 
construction of an 860-megawatt station in Pomerania, in northern Poland. - Irish Independent
## A company of solicitor and property developer Noel Smyth has lost its action for 140m euro damages against 
three developers - Larry O'Mahony, Thomas McFeely and Liam Carroll - over their involvement in deals related to a 
planned E300m development at The Square shopping centre in Tallaght. Mr Justice Brian McGovern today 
criticised the conduct of all the parties involved in the deals and said none 'emerge with much credit for the manner 
in which they conducted their business dealings with each other'. Liability for the multi-million euro costs of the 63-
day action will be decided later. - RTE ## Almost 60pc of people saw their gross pay fall last year, and most of the 
rest were on a pay freeze, a new survey shows. The survey for Friends First investment house also found a 
widespread drop in consumer spending, with eating out and entertainment most likely to be curtailed. Over 90pc of 
the 1,000 18-44-year-olds surveyed by Empathy Research said that they had cut back in these areas. Almost 70pc 
Roundup:E71m ash bill for Irish airlines E71m Ash Bill
said their spending had decreased compared to last year, with the biggest proportion among the 35-44 age group. - 
Irish Independent ## The government is considering forcing major supermarket chains to publicise their accounts 
over allegations they are making excessive profits on food. In a deepening row over grocery prices, Taoiseach 
Brian Cowen bowed to pressure to re-examine legal loopholes that allow retail giants to keep their Irish takings 
secret. Labour leader Eamon Gilmore said revelations this week that food was almost 30pc dearer in Ireland than in 
the rest of Europe - at a time when farmers and producers were being squeezed - was simply unacceptable. - Irish 
Examiner ## RTE's popular No Frontiers travel programme engaged in improper product placement and gave 
undue prominence to Aer Lingus at the expense of Ryanair, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has found. The 
BAI's compliance committee said a report which highlighted Aer Lingus's service but failed to mention Ryanair's 
flights to a French destination amounted to advertising for Aer Lingus. Ryanair complained to the BAI about the 
programme, broadcast on March 7th this year. It involved presenter Jenny Buckley, who travelled to La Rochelle. - 
Irish Times ## SIPTU has appointed a temporary replacement for its Health Divisional Organiser Matt Merrigan, 
who is currently on sick leave. In an internal memo to all SIPTU staff earlier today, the union's General Secretary 
Joe O'Flynn announced that due to Mr Merrigan's illness, the union is appointing a temporary replacement. Paul 
Bell, who is currently their health Sector organiser, will be appointed to the post of Acting Divisional Organiser with 
responsibility for the Health Division. - RTE ## Ireland has kept its place in the top 20 digital economies in the world, 
according to an annual ranking by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Ireland climbed one place to 17th in the 2010 
EIU digital economy list, swapping places with Germany. Sweden overtook Denmark to top the rankings. The EIU 
said the "digital divide" between richer and poorer nations was closing, partly as a result of a change in the way in 
which it calculated the strength of a country's digital economy. - Irish Times ## The number of tenants claiming rent 
supplement has jumped by 60pc in the last three years to 95,500, the Minister for Social Protection Eamon O Cuiv 
has told the Dail. Despite the scheme being for short-term purposes, Mr O Cuiv said 37,800 of these tenants have 
been receiving rent supplement for 18 months or longer. The Minister said another 16,800 people were getting 
mortgage interest supplement. That number had doubled in the last two years. The estimated cost of the mortgage 
scheme for this year is 63.9m euros.

Ryanair to cut winter capacity in UK

O'Leary sees loss of 2,500 Stansted jobs
Body
Ryanair is to cut capacity in the UK by 16 per cent this winter as it shifts its aircraft to countries with cheaper 
airports and lower passenger taxes such as Spain.
Europe's biggest budget airline said it would reduce the number of aircraft at its main UK base of Stansted, where it 
is by far the biggest carrier, from 24 last winter to 22. According to Michael O'Leary, chief executive, the capacity 
cuts would result in the loss of 2,500 jobs at the airport in a full year and 1.5m passengers between November and 
March 2011.
The airline also plans to cut winter flights at most of its other UK bases except for Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford.
"These are real losses to the UK," said Mr O'Leary. "This is a time in winter when we should be bringing more 
people here, particularly to London."
Stansted played down his claims. "Last winter they said there would be a reduction in passenger numbers of about 
2.5m and it turned out to be about 300,000, which was largely due to the economic downturn."
Mr O'Leary, sporting a German football top three days after England's World Cup exit, also lashed out at the new 
UK transport secretary, Philip Hammond, who told the Financial Times that UK domestic flights would become "a 
thing of the past" as they were replaced by trains.
"If he thinks the future is more trains, then sorry   Mr Hammond you just haven't a bloody clue," said Mr O'Leary. 
"It's time to stop pandering to the environmental goons and start addressing how you're going to make Britain a 
more attractive tourism destination."
Mr O'Leary also said his counterpart at British Airways, Willie Walsh, had done a "fantastic job" of fighting striking 
BA cabin crew , though if Mr O'Leary had been running BA, "I would have sacked them all long ago".
Ryanair to cut winter capacity in UK
The UK capacity cuts, which may be followed by others in Ireland, are similar to those it has announced in recent 
years for Stansted , where it says its aircraft numbers have fallen from a peak of about 30 in 2007/08 to the 22 
planned for this coming winter.
Analysts said this was in line with the airline's refinement of a business model focused on relentlessly paring back 
costs.

(RTTNews) - Irish low fare airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Tuesday said it will cut UK winter capacity 
by 16% from November that may result in a loss of more than two million passengers at UK airports this winter. The 
capacity reduction is due to the government's newly introduced tourist tax. The airline warned that the tax of GBP 
11 per passenger shall continue to damage the country's traffic, tourism and jobs.
Ryanair plans to cut winter capacity at London Stansted Airport by 17% from November, and it also intends to 
reduce winter flights at most of its other UK bases, except Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford.
Ryanair expects to switch these London based aircraft to other European bases where governments have scrapped 
tourist taxes and reduced passenger charges, even to zero, to support tourism and traffic growth. The airline said it 
will base 22 aircraft in Stansted this winter compared to 24 last winter, with 135 fewer weekly frequencies and a 
loss of up to 1.5 million passengers at Stansted between November and March 2011.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said, "Today's cutbacks underline the urgent need to, break-up the high cost BAA 
Airport Monopoly (as recommended by the Competition Commission) and scrap the damaging GBP 11 tourist tax 
which has caused UK traffic to collapse over the past two years."
According to reports, from November, APD will be increased to a range of GBP 11 to GBP 12 on Band A flights for 
up to two thousand miles, and on Band B flights of 2,001 to 4,000 miles to a range of GBP 45 to GBP 60.
On Band C flights for 4,001 to 6,000 miles, APD will be increased to a range of GBP 50 to GBP 75 and on Band D 
flights of 6,001 to 8,000 miles to a range of GBP 55 to GBP 85.
The airline said it called on the UK govt to scrap its Air Passenger Duty or travel tax and published independent 
analysis showing that tourist taxes have caused steep tourism declines in the UK while seat capacity grew strongly 
in those EU countries which have scrapped these taxes. Last year, Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish 
Governments have scrapped similar tourist taxes and/or airport charges to stop falling passenger numbers.
In June, 2009 Ryanair has announced its decision to freeze growth at nine UK bases, in view of the loss of over 4.5 
million passengers in the first five months, due to the tourist tax and high airport charges.
According to independent capacity analysis, growth has returned to the Belgian, Dutch and Spanish markets where 
the tourist taxes were scrapped and/or reduced airport charges.
Ryanair To Cut UK Winter Capacity By 16% Due To Tourist Tax - Update
According to Treasury figures, the tax will recoup GBP 2.9 billion next year, compared with GBP 1.9 billion raised in 
the previous year. However, the Treasury intends to raise GBP 3.8 billion from air travel in fiscal year 2014-15, so 
further increases in APD could be coming, said reports.
In Monday's regular trading session, RYAAY closed trading at $27.48 per share on the Nasdaq.
RYA is currently trading at EUR 3.59 per share, down EUR 0.06 or 1.57%, on the London Stock Exchange.

Flydubai
Flydubai is the world's latest low-cost carrier arrival, having launched operations just one year ago this month, and 
is serious about its intent to replicate EasyJet and Ryanair's success in its own region.
"We live in the middle of almost three billion people," says boss Ghaith Al Ghaith. "And if you can offer them this 
easy, low-cost way to fly, then most people will travel more."
Former Emirates senior executive Al Ghaith has overseen the transformation of state-owned Flydubai shortly after it 
was established two years ago by government decree, when it was originally planned as to operate from the new Al 
Maktoum International airport at Jebel Ali, to fully operational airline based at Dubai's current international airport 
"DXB", with a staff headcount exceeding 500.
The airline has enjoyed phenomenal growth in its first 12 months, having added its 21st destination - Sri Lankan 
capital Colombo - in June and is well on its way to carrying its one millionth passenger this year.
The airline has eight 189-seat Boeing 737-800s in service and will add five more before the end of the year. "About 
10-plus" will be added to its fleet each year from 2011, says Al Ghaith.
"Flydubai currently employs around 220 cabin crew and 130 pilots," says Al Ghaith. "Our expansion is very rapid 
and we expect to almost double these figures by the end of the year."
The one-year-old airline's stated mission is "to increase the number of people travelling to and from the UAE" 
through low fares. It joins established local rival Air Arabia, which is based up the road at Sharjah, in the region's 
embryonic but growing no-frills sector.
FLYDUBAILow cost in the GulfHeadline to come INTRODUCTION: Emirates ' little sister is expanding at a 
phenomenal rate and the low-cost carrier needs pilots to h....
Air Arabia (see P20) serves more than 40 points across the region with a fleet in excerss of 20 A320s. Another 
growing rival is Kuwait-based Jazeera Airways, which has 11 A320s and serves more than 20 destinations.
But Al Ghaith is not concerned about sharing the region's low-fare market, saying that there is "big room to grow" 
and predicting that more will enter the market "as there are not enough right now".
Flydubai launched with services to Beirut, and its network spans into eastern Europe (Istanbul) and stretches 
across to Asian points such as Kathmandu in Nepal. It extends across the Red Sea to Africa (Djibouti), while local 
destinations include Bahrain, Doha and Muscat.
Although the original plan had been to launch from Dubai's new airport, the lengthy delay in the opening of Jebel Ali 
- it will start this summer - prompted the switch to Dubai International airport. The existing airport's capacity has 
"finally got the relief it needed", says Al Ghaith, which means it will remain Flydubai's home "for the foreseeable 
future, but we will look to see how we can take advantage of Jebel Ali".
Although it is linked to Emirates Airline through their shared state-ownership status, that is where the connections 
end, says Al Ghaith. The airline did have some help from its big sister to get off the ground - Al Ghaith and other 
executives moved across and initially operated from the carrier's headquarters building - but now it is standing on 
its own.
It has its own operating licence and its own offices on the north side of DXB near its Terminal 2 operational base. 
And although some Emirates management moved over - including Al Ghaith who spent 22 years with the flag 
carrier - there is an arms-length relationship between the two.
"The bulk of our people come from outside [Emirates] - our pilots and cabin crew that represent the majority of our 
staff."
He adds that some cabin crew looking to start families have left their job at Emirates and joined Flydubai as it is 
easier to settle down flying with a point-to-point airline.
"We had almost 11,500 applications for pilots and cabin crew in our first few months, so it was very easy to get the 
people we needed."
Being a short-haul low-cost carrier, Flydubai structures its pilot pay and conditions differently to that of Emirates.
"We work our pilots and cabin crew as per the rules and we pay them as much as anybody else in the region," says 
Al Ghaith. Where it differs he adds, is that the airline avoids the old local traditions of providing transport and 
accommodation for crews like the network carriers - this is a legacy of the "old days" when there was little modern 
infrastructure in the Gulf region.
"The environment has changed, so we offer cash payments to our pilots and they have to make their own 
arrangements and that reduces our costs because we don't have to manage these services."
Cabin crew are able to share in the profit from on-board sales such as food and duty free goods, so their 
performance is reflected in their pay, says Al Ghaith. "This is good for the airline and good for the cabin crew."
Al Ghaith says that thanks to the 737 being so popular and "like a dinosaur - it's been around for a long time - lots of 
pilots [have a rating]". The airline's flightcrew are a multitude of nationalities including Europeans and "we even 
have some from South America", he adds.
But with a fleet of 50-plus 737s in the initial plan, Flydubai has been working to access a steady stream of pilots. 
Last year, a road show was held at an undisclosed European airline offering its flightcrew early retirement, which 
resulted in 64 potential recruits, says Al Ghaith. "We don't foresee any difficulty in recruiting highly qualified pilots - 
one thing I can say for sure is that the current economic circumstances have made this much easier than we 
expected it to be."
FLYDUBAILow cost in the GulfHeadline to come INTRODUCTION: Emirates ' little sister is expanding at a 
phenomenal rate and the low-cost carrier needs pilots to h....
The airline requires a minimum of 5,000h flying time for captains, with a minimum of 1,000h in command of 737 
Classics or Next Generation variants as well as a minimum of 1,500h in command of a multi-crew, multi-engine 
aircraft (jet or turboprop) in excess of 10t maximum take-off weight.
Although the airline favours applications from 737-rated pilots, Al Ghaith says that going forward "we're always 
open to all the options to get highly qualified crew".
While there are plans for an in-house pilot training operation the services can be bought in locally from the 
Emirates-CAE joint venture training centre in Dubai. The airline does provide cabin crew instruction.
"Because there are not a lot of UAE nationals flying the 737s it is difficult to find the right experience locally," says 
Al Ghaith. "We will in the future consider a national programme to bring in more national pilots."
The majority of cabin crew recruited so far have no previous in-flight experience, so have been trained by the 
airline's own instructors. Although a Gulf Air 737 evacuation trainer in Bahrain was used initially, Flydubai now has 
its own in-house device.
"We have a rigorous selection process to ensure we are recruiting the right type of person and we then put them 
through an intensive five-week training course that covers all aspects of the job, with the main focus being on 
safety," Al Ghaith says.
Like the other airlines in the region the cabin crew are broad mixture of nationalities, with staff from 50 different 
countries including Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Asians. However the majority of cabin crew have been recruited 
from within the UAE.
Al Ghaith: predicts more will enter the low-fare market

tax. "Sadly UK traffic and tourism continues to collapse while Ryanair continues to grow rapidly in those countries 
which welcome tourists instead of taxing them," said CEO Michael O' Leary. "Independent capacity analysis shows 
that growth has returned to the Belgian, Dutch and Spanish markets after their governments scrapped tourist taxes 
and/or reduced airport charges, in some cases to zero, in order to stimulate tourism and jobs."

Ryanair today announced it will cut UK winter capacity by 16pc from November.
According to Ryanair, this will see the loss of over two million passengers at UK airports this winter.
Ryanair said that it will switch these London based aircraft to other European bases with lower tourist taxes and 
reduced passenger charges.

Body
The country's airports are to come under scrutiny in a wide-ranging review by the Oireachtas Transport Committee 
that will look at the funding and viability of all airports.
The committee also plans to hire an aviation consultant to report on Ireland's airport operations.
The report is expected to be completed early next year.
It will contain recommendations to complement the committee's analysis of the situation.
The Oireachtas committee is expected to examine a host of areas, including the need for smaller airports and the 
subsidised public service obligation routes between Dublin and other airports in the state.
It will also look at whether the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) should remain as the authority for Shannon and Cork 
airports, as well as the possibility of more privately owned airports or the prospect of private public partnerships in 
the sector.
Executives from the DAA appeared at the transport committee last week
The management and board members of all airports, including Knock, Galway, Waterford, Kerry, Sligo and 
Donegal, are expected to appear before the committee in the coming months.
Airline management, such as Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary and Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph 
Mueller, will also be invited to attend and give their views on what they believe should be done to maximise air 
traffic in and out of Ireland.
Fianna Fáil TD Frank Fahey, who chairs the Oireachtas committee, said it would look at ''the whole cost'' of running 
the country's airports. ''Is money being spent as it should be?" he asked.
Airports around the country to face major review process
''There is also the issue of the dominance of Dublin Airport over other airports and how more air traffic could be 
brought to the regions.
''We are also looking at the economic development of the airports, and whether they should be a profitable or 
necessary public infrastructure.
''I would hold the view that their role is to be centres for economic development," he said.
Fahey said that the review had already generated interest among aviation consultants, and he was hopeful that a 
consultant with ''international pedigree'' could be hired for the independent report.
It is expected to be similar to the review carried out on the country's ports.

Body
If you had to come up with a collective noun for a bunch of airline people, what would it be? A flock? A formation? A 
swarm? Sometimes, especially after a day or two at a large air industry gathering, I start to think of other words, 
such as a "moan" or a "fret" or a "whinge". There is an old joke in the business that the whine you hear in an aircraft 
after the engines are turned off is just the pilots talking. But these days, the pilots are not alone. Consider the blast 
of grievance emitted two weeks ago in Berlin at the annual general meeting of the International Air Transport 
Association, the body that acts for most of the world's oldest and best-known airlines. In front of hundreds of airline 
executives, Giovanni Bisignani, Iata's vivacious Italian chief, launched an assault on the "national embarrassment" 
of overcharging airports; the "shortsighted nonsense" of striking crews; and, to cheers from his audience, the 
"leeches" in travel reservation companies.
That was before he got to the "unco-ordinated bureaucratic mess" in Europe, where authorities shut down airspace 
for nearly six days because of the menace of a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland that many airlines say never 
existed.
Listening to him, it struck me that the last time I heard so much complaining, it came not from an airline boss but a 
passenger. One of the great paradoxes of modern flight is that so many more of us do it, yet so few of us seem to 
enjoy it. The world of aviation has come a long way since Howard Hughes was showing off his latest plane to 
Katharine Hepburn and people dressed up to go to the airport. Today, there are terrorists with explosives in their 
underpants and airline bosses such as Ryanair's Michael O'Leary who wants to charge people to use the lavatory, 
and says he would "wipe their bums for a fiver".
So what comes next? Will anything change? Or do the people making the decisions that will shape the future of 
flying think today's trends will merely become more marked?
It is now 16 years since the billionaire investor Warren Buffett said capitalism would have been better off if Orville 
Wright had been shot down at Kitty Hawk in 1903, because the industry had made a net loss ever since. Things 
have only grown worse. Over the past decade, airlines have lost another $50bn thanks to the September 11

terrorist attacks, soaring fuel prices and recession. The situation is especially awful for many of the household-
name international carriers in Europe and the US. Every other week seems to bring news of a real or longed-for 
merger as they struggle to fend off sprightly no-frills rivals, striking workers and deep-pocketed Middle East 
newcomers.
Last year, the biggest airline in the world in terms of the number of passengers carried was not the American 
Airlines of George Clooney's hit film Up in the Air, or even its giant rival Delta, but Dallas-based budget carrier 
Southwest Airlines. The fifth biggest was Southwest's rambunctious Irish love child, Ryanair. These airlines fly 
shorter distances compared with international companies such as British Airways. But unlike BA, which has lost 
nearly £1bn over the past two years, they have stayed profitable. And their rise has made flying possible for 
millions.
Yet on several counts, air travel is the only form of mass transport to have gone backwards over the past 10 years. 
Trains go faster. Cars are smarter. Bikes are lighter and bike paths more numerous. Buses are still late and you can 
never get a seat at rush hour, but the windows are bigger and seats more comfortable. Aircraft travel, on the other 
hand, has grown appreciably worse on a number of important measures. Most obviously, post-9/11 security checks 
and ever more exotic ploys to extract extra money from the unwary passenger have turned flying into a maddening 
experience.
Low-cost airlines at least make no pretence about being low cost. But their tactics are now aped by older, cash-
strapped carriers that still promote themselves as full-service. It is especially grim in economy class. Air France is 
one of a number of airlines that has squeezed extra seats up the back of the aircraft after bringing in new "premium 
economy" seating, in between business class and economy.
There is another, even stranger, reason that flying has gone backwards. In a world used to rapid technical progress, 
you cannot fly as fast as you could a decade ago. And that's because the supersonic passenger jet is dead. Before 
Concorde took its last flight in 2003, it was possible to cross the Atlantic in just over three hours. It is true that only 
the wealthy could afford such flights. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, which used to fly 
Concorde, along with Air France, says only a "handful" of the aircraft were ever made and the number who flew on 
them was "tiny". It is also true, as the rise of the budget giants shows, that millions more passengers can now afford 
to fly than ever could before. And if Iata's projections are correct, the number of passenger departures will grow 
from 2.3 billion last year to 16 billion by 2050.
The problem is that, in a world of Moore's law - shorthand for the computer industry's ability to produce 
progressively more powerful and cheaper technology over the past 50 years - many people expect their flights to be 
better. "Most of the time, capitalism has managed to produce cheaper goods at a higher quality," says author Alain 
de Botton, an aviation enthusiast and recent writer-in-residence at Heathrow. "I think the airline industry is a 
worrying exception: it's cheaper but worse quality."
"It's a surprising trend too," he adds, "because of the lack of apology. Imagine if a car manufacturer said 'we're 
going to make this cheap product and we're going to glory in its shoddiness'."
I have raised these complaints about modern air travel with a number of senior figures in the aviation industry, and I 
think it is fair to say that most of them looked as if I had just asked if they would like to step outside for a quick puff 
of crack. It is not that they are unaware of their customers' complaints. It is just that they are far more focused on 
two other sweeping trends in air transport that many of us take for granted: the steep fall in fare prices and rise in 
safety.
Over a lunch of curried sausages in Berlin, Alan Joyce, the head of Australia's Qantas, told me that when his airline 
started flying abroad in 1935, a trip from Sydney to London cost the equivalent of 122 weeks of an average 
person's salary and took several days. "Today it is just over one week's salary and takes 23 hours."
Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Ireland's Aer Lingus, put it like this: "In 1961, a first-class ticket from Frankfurt 
to New York and back cost the same as a new Mercedes-Benz 190D. Today, you have to pay 13 times as much for 
a new Mercedes as you do for the same first-class ticket." Few see the trend reversing soon.
Flying Backwards Stories - The Future Of Air Travel
In addition, flying has become much safer, even if it does not always seem to be. As Iata's Giovanni Bisignani 
points out: "When Iata started 60 years ago, we had roughly nine million passengers and 247 fatalities. Last year, 
we carried 2.3 billion passengers and there were 685 fatalities." This is because safety standards, aircraft and the 
equipment on them have become much more advanced. The founder of BMI, Sir Michael Bishop, one of the most 
respected figures in the business, puts it more directly: "Pilots don't like to hear this, but the truth of the matter is 
that by giving them less to do, it has actually made the industry considerably safer."
Yet passengers' complaints stand, even if they look trivial next to matters of affordability and safety. Will they get a 
hearing in the near future?
A lot of frequent fliers are fond of thinking that the future of air travel might look like Canada's Porter Airlines, an 
upstart carrier that flies from Toronto's Billy Bishop airport, just moments from the city's downtown centre (imagine 
an airport practically at the foot of St Paul's in London or the Empire State Building in New York). Porter's check-in 
desks look more like those of a boutique hotel. Its lounge offers free espresso from Franke coffee makers and a 
bank of Apple Mac computers for free internet browsing. Onboard food is free. Baggage allowances are generous.
But whether this is the future of flying is unclear: earlier this month, Porter backed off from plans to raise fresh 
capital with an initial public offering. As one investor told Reuters, the landscape is littered with the corpses of 
airlines that provide great service.
Meanwhile, one thing seems certain: flying is unlikely to get faster. After Concorde was grounded, several 
companies said they would develop a replacement. None has done so, so far. And none is likely to, according to 
Peter Morris, chief economist at the Ascend Worldwide aviation consultancy. Several years ago, he explains, Airbus 
and Boeing, the world's two biggest passenger jet manufacturers, tried to figure out if the next big thing in aircraft 
should be another super-fast jet or another great big one, like Boeing's iconic 747 jumbo. "Boeing went for neither 
and Airbus went for one of them," says Morris - the A380 superjumbo that began flying in 2005. The reason was 
economics: "The industry wants lower costs per seat rather than faster seats," he says. "It went for the less risky 
thing."
Is the future, alternatively, in space? Sir Richard Branson's plans for commercial space travel are advancing, but 
are still some way from lift-off.
In the meantime, many people hope to see the aggravation of the airport security check diminish. Advances in body 
screening technology, say many airlines, could eventually see an end to the rigmarole of having to take off your 
shoes, belt, watch and anything else that goes beep, though the widespread introduction of such devices is still 
some way off.
More hopefully, flying is on the verge of becoming greener. Aircraft used to be made of wood, then aluminium, and 
now, at both Boeing and Airbus, they are going plastic - or rather, carbon fibre-reinforced plastic composites, light, 
tough material you might see in fishing rods or golf clubs. Large parts of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner passenger 
jet, which is due to begin commercial flights in about six months, and Airbus's A350, due more than two years later, 
are being made of composites. Both manufacturers are promising dramatic fuel cost savings, and airlines have 
been enthusiastic. The Dreamliner, with more than 850 orders, has been the world's fastest-selling new aircraft.
Boeing is promising a whole new passenger experience on the Dreamliner, too, as I discovered in April on a visit to 
the company's Seattle assembly plants, where there is a mock-up of the new aircraft's interior. "It's like a limousine!" 
enthused Kenneth Price, the marketing executive who ushered me into the cabin. "We wanted to take people back 
to the magic of flying - that feeling of the first time you ever flew."
Whether this happens remains to be seen, but the Dreamliner certainly looks different. The first thing you notice is 
the striking LED lighting - coloured sky blue the day I visited - which makes the interior feel higher and brighter. The 
windows are bigger and instead of sliding shutters, dimmer switches make them darker or lighter. Boeing also 
claims people will leave a 787 flight feeling less dehydrated and headachy, because the composite construction will 
allow higher humidity and increased pressure, so you will feel as if you are at 6,000ft rather than the normal 8,000ft.
Flying Backwards Stories - The Future Of Air Travel
Jim Albaugh, who runs Boeing's commercial aircraft division, is equally optimistic about another green trend in 
aviation once thought wildly unlikely to come to much: biofuels. "Without going too far out on a limb, if I were to look 
into the future I could see us operating 100 per cent biofuel," he told me in Berlin. The last two and a half years 
have seen a big jump in the number of airlines testing fuels derived from ingredients such as algae and coconut oil. 
There are still stumbling blocks, especially price, but if Albaugh is correct, it could reshape the industry.
Whether this makes us less guilty about flying is another matter. But the future could start to look very different for 
airlines, and all of us who fly with them. Instead of being so unprofitable that every shock leaves them struggling to 
survive, airlines might become more financially hardy. That in turn could lower the endless round of cost-cuts. 
Which in turn could reduce strikes and improve service. It is not too difficult to imagine that stronger airlines might 
have more heft in persuading airport owners and governments to improve creaking infrastructure and tackle 
security hold-ups. There is even, just possibly, a chance that flying could become fun again.Fifty years of transport - 
the roadblocks and green lights
TRAINS

many eastern railroads was the year their trains carried material for the road.
1963 - The Beeching Report leads to the closure of 9,000 miles of the UK's rail network.
1970
1964 - Japan's bullet train launches, cutting travel time between Tokyo and Osaka from six hours 40 minutes to four 
hours.
1965 Long stretches of the M6 motorway open. By the time the M25 is completed in 1986, cars present significant 
competition to longdistance trains.
1980
1971 - The US stops forcing train companies to run unprofitable passenger services, signalling the beginning of the 
end for serious long-distance rail travel.
1990 - 1981 Europe gets a high-speed train service, France's TGV. The first line connects Paris and Lyon, at 
speeds of up to 173.6mph.
1994-1997 - Privatisation of British Rail, bringing new services to passengers.
2000
2000 - The Hatfield crash caused by a broken rail sparks concern about the state of the British rail network. 2004 
Opening of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line, the first new transcontinental service since completion of the 
Trans-Siberian in 1913.
2010
2007 - The Channel Tunnel Rail Link is completed, introducing high-speed train travel the UK. 2008 Rail passenger 
numbers in Britain hit postwar high. The recession has damped rail use since.
CARS
1960
1966 - The first Toyota Corolla rolls off the assembly line; it becomes the best-selling car of all time.
Flying Backwards Stories - The Future Of Air Travel
1970 - 1975 The oil crisis persuades the US to introduce fuel economy standards for cars. Ironically, this will boost 
sales of SUVs since their light-truck frames mean they can evade the limits.
1975 - Singapore introduces the world's first congestioncharge.
1979 - Chrysler is bailed out by the US government in the form of $1.5bn in loan guarantees.
1980
1982 - Honda starts building its Accord marque in the US with non-union labour.
1990
1997 - The Toyota Prius goes on sale in Japan and becomes the world's most famous hybrid.
1998 - Daimler-Benz announces its "marriage made in heaven" with Chrysler. Within a decade, it will sell the US 
marque for about a fifth of the price it paid for it.
2000
2005 - MG Rover, the last mass-production carmaker in Britain, goes into administration. Some assets and designs 
are later acquired by China's SAIC.

1960
Early 1960s - The term "jet set" is coined, referring to the well-off who party around the world thanks to international 
air travel.
1970
1970 - The Boeing 747 jumbo jet enters service, ushering in cheap, mass air transport.
1971 - Launch in the US of Southwest Airlines, the world's first low-cost carrier.
1980
1976 - Air France and British Airways put their first supersonic Concorde aircraft into service.
1978 - The US Airline Deregulation Act becomes law, aiming to create a more flexible market.
1990
1988 - A bomb in the hold of a Pan Am jet detonates over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 270 people. The airline 
goes bankrupt three years later, one of several big-name carriers to disappear.
2000
Flying Backwards Stories - The Future Of Air Travel
2001 - The 9/11 terrorist attacks trigger increased airport security. 2007 Launch of the Airbus 380, the world's 
largest passenger aircraft. 2008 The liberalising US and EU Open Skies deal comes into effect.

1967 - The QE2 is launched by operator Cunard. She continues a regular schedule of transatlantic crossings until 
2008.
1968 - The SR.N4, the largest passenger hovercraft to date, begins a cross-Channel service, cutting the journey 
time between Dover and Boulogne to 35 minutes.
1970
1970 - Boeing's 747 signals the end of passenger transport by ship, although the decline began as far back as 
1958, when airlines put the first transatlantic passenger jets into service.
1980
1987 - The Herald of Free Enterprise ferry capsizes after leaving the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, leading to a rethink 
on safety. The Estonia disaster in 1994 and the Al-Salam Boccaccio sinking in 2006 spur similar reassessments.
1990
1994 - The Channel Tunnel opens, providing competition for ferries.
1999 - Intra-EU duty-free shopping is abolished. Ferry operators have to raise fares and axe routes to make up the 
lost income.
2000
2000 - Hoverspeed ends its cross-Channel hovercraft service.

have only grown worse. Over the past decade, airlines have lost another $50bn thanks to the September 11 
terrorist attacks, soaring fuel prices and recession. The situation is especially awful for many of the household-
name international carriers in Europe and the US. Every other week seems to bring news of a real or longed-for 
merger as they struggle to fend off sprightly no-frills rivals, striking workers and deep-pocketed Middle East 
newcomers.
Last year, the biggest airline in the world in terms of the number of passengers carried was not the American 
Airlines of George Clooney's hit film Up in the Air , or even its giant rival Delta, but Dallas-based budget carrier 
Southwest Airlines. The fifth-biggest was Southwest's rambunctious Irish love child, Ryanair. These airlines fly 
shorter distances compared with international companies such as British Airways. But unlike BA, which has lost 
nearly £1bn over the past two years, they have stayed profitable. And their rise has made flying possible for 
millions.
Yet on several counts, air travel is the only form of mass transport to have gone backwards over the past 10 years. 
Trains go faster. Cars are smarter. Bikes are lighter and bike paths more numerous. Buses are still late and you can 
never get a seat at rush hour, but the windows are bigger and seats more comfortable. Aircraft travel, on the other 
hand, has grown appreciably worse on a number of important measures. Most obviously, post-9/11 security checks 
and ever more exotic ploys to extract extra money from the unwary passenger have turned flying into a maddening 
experience.
Low-cost airlines at least make no pretence about being low cost. But their tactics are now aped by older, cash-
strapped carriers that still promote themselves as full-service. It is especially grim in economy class. Air France is 
one of a number of airlines that has squeezed extra seats up the back of the aircraft after bringing in new "premium 
economy" seating, in between business class and economy.
There is another, even stranger, reason that flying has gone backwards. In a world used to rapid technical progress, 
you cannot fly as fast as you could a decade ago. And that's because the supersonic passenger jet is dead. Before 
Concorde took its last flight in 2003, it was possible to cross the Atlantic in just over three hours. It is true that only

"handful" of the aircraft were ever made and the number who flew on them was "tiny". It is also true, as the rise of 
the budget giants shows, that millions more passengers can now afford to fly than ever could before. And if Iata's 
projections are correct, the number of passenger departures will grow from 2.3bn last year to 16bn by 2050.
The problem is that, in a world of Moore's law - shorthand for the computer industry's ability to produce 
progressively more powerful and cheaper technology over the past 50 years - many people expect their flights to be 
better. "Most of the time, capitalism has managed to produce cheaper goods at a higher quality," says author Alain

Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Ireland's Aer Lingus, put it like this: "In 1961, a first-class ticket from Frankfurt 
to New York and back cost the same as a new Mercedes-Benz 190D. Today, you have to pay 13 times as much for 
a new Mercedes as you do for the same first-class ticket." Few see the trend reversing soon.
In addition, flying has become much safer, even if it does not always seem to be. As Iata's Giovanni Bisignani

New York). Porter's check-in desks look more like those of a boutique hotel. Its lounge offers free espresso from 
Franke coffee-makers and a bank of Apple Mac computers for free internet browsing. Onboard food is free. 
Baggage allowances are generous.
But whether this is the future of flying is unclear: earlier this month, Porter backed off from plans to raise fresh 
capital with an initial public offering. As one investor told Reuters, the landscape is littered with the corpses of 
airlines that provide great service.
Meanwhile, one thing seems certain: flying is unlikely to get faster. After Concorde was grounded, several 
companies said they would develop a replacement. None has done so, so far. And none is likely to, according to 
Peter Morris, chief economist at the Ascend Worldwide aviation consultancy. Several years ago, he explains, Airbus 
and Boeing, the world's two biggest passenger jet manufacturers, tried to figure out if the next big thing in aircraft 
should be another super-fast jet or another great big one, like Boeing's iconic 747 jumbo. "Boeing went for neither 
and Airbus went for one of them," says Morris - the A380 superjumbo that began flying in 2005. The reason was 
economics: "The industry wants lower costs per seat rather than faster seats," he says. "It went for the less risky 
thing."
Is the future, alternatively, in space? Sir Richard Branson's plans for commercial space travel are advancing, but 
are still some way from lift-off. In the meantime, many people hope to see the aggravation of the airport security 
check diminish. Advances in body screening technology, say many airlines, could eventually see an end to the 
rigmarole of having to take off your shoes, belt, watch and anything else that goes beep, though the widespread 
introduction of such devices is still some way off. More hopefully, flying is on the verge of becoming greener. 
Aircraft used to be made of wood, then aluminium, and now, at both Boeing and Airbus, they are going plastic - or 
rather, carbon fibre-reinforced plastic composites, light, tough material you might see in fishing rods or golf clubs. 
Large parts of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner passenger jet, which is due to begin commercial flights in about six 
months, and Airbus's A350, due more than two years later, are being made of composites. Both manufacturers are 
promising dramatic fuel cost savings, and airlines have been enthusiastic.
The Dreamliner, with more than 850 orders, has been the world's fastestselling new aircraft. Boeing is promising a 
whole new passenger experience on the Dreamliner, too, as I discovered in April on a visit to the company's Seattle 
assembly plants, where there is a mock-up of the new aircraft's interior. "It's like a limousine!" enthused Kenneth 
Price, the marketing executive who ushered me into the cabin. "We wanted to take people back to the magic of 
flying - that feeling of the first time you ever flew."
Whether this happens remains to be seen, but the Dreamliner certainly looks different. The first thing you notice is 
the striking LED lighting - coloured sky blue the day I visited - that makes the interior feel higher and brighter. The 
windows are bigger and instead of sliding shutters, dimmer switches make them darker or lighter. Boeing also 
Flying backwards While trains go faster, cars are smarter and buses are smoother, aeroplane travel has 
worsened, says Pilita Clark
claims people will leave a 787 flight feeling less dehydrated and headachy, because the composite construction will 
allow higher humidity and increased pressure, so you will feel as if the internal pressure is at 6,000ft rather than the 
normal 8,000ft.
Jim Albaugh, who runs Boeing's commercial aircraft division, is equally optimistic about another green trend in 
aviation once thought wildly unlikely to come to much: biofuels. "Without going too far out on a limb, if I were to look 
into the future I could see us operating 100 per cent biofuel," he told me in Berlin. The past two and a half years 
have seen a big jump in the number of airlines testing fuels derived from ingredients such as algae and coconut oil. 
There are still stumbling blocks, especially price, but if Albaugh is correct, it could reshape the industry.
Whether this makes us less guilty about flying is another matter. But the future could start to look very different for 
airlines, and all of us who fly with them. Instead of being so unprofitable that every shock leaves them struggling to 
survive, airlines might become more financially hardy. That could lower the endless round of cost-cuts, in turn 
reducing strikes and improving service. It is not too difficult to imagine that stronger airlines might have more heft in 
persuading airport owners and governments to improve creaking infrastructure and tackle security hold-ups. There 
is even, just possibly, a chance that flying could become fun again.

The main Dublin shares index dipped well below the 3,000 level on Thursday with CRH and the banks leading the 
fall as a downbeat assessment of the U.S. economy by the Fed Reserve weighed on sentiment.
Confidence in the prospect for economic recovery was rattled as the U.S. Federal Reserve scaled back its 
assessment of the pace of the nation's economic recovery, taking note of pockets of weakness. It also issued a 
cautionary note about volatile financial markets in the light of Europe's debt woes. Banks were among the hardest 
hit, with Barclays, HSBC, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank off 0.9 to 2.5 percent. "We've started 
to see heightened risk aversion on the back of the Fed's comments. There is still a lot of uncertainty in terms of 
European sovereign debt and volumes are quite low," said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index in 
London. "People are scaling down their positions on concern that we might head lower. A lot of our clients are 
looking at orders between the 5,025 and the 5,050 level on the (UK's) FTSE 100 for short-term support."
CRH suffered most from the dip in confidence with the stock down 27c to E18.09.
Banks were weaker again with AIB down 1c to E0.98, Bank of Ireland dipped 3c to E0.72 and Irish Life and 
Permanent lost 1c to E1.64. Press reports indicate that the Polish Treasury Minister has confirmed that PKO Bank, 
the state controlled bank, would submit a non-binding offer for BZWBK - in which AIB has a major stake - next 
week. Goodbody said that, while recent speculation would indicate a reasonable number of bidders are interested 
in the asset, "we wonder whether the comments from the State have the potential to narrow down the field of 
interested parties if they perceive the State has already outlined its preferred bidder for the business". After the 
Malaga base announcement on Tuesday, Ryanair yesterday officially opened another new base, this time in 
Valencia, returning to the city two years after it departed after a falling out with the local government. Ryanair will be 
putting in 2 aircraft into the airport, which is "only" 8kms from the city. Shares in Ryanair gained 1c to E3.64. Shares 
in insurers, FBD, climbed 3c to E6.63. Recent reports in the media say that Quinn Insurance is moving back

towards profit. Interestingly though, they state that along with the restructuring process, price increases in the UK,

Quinn Insurance to try and increase its market share in Dublin. DSG International (operator of the Dixon's and PC 
World retail brands) released its 2010 results, which were modestly behind market expectations. Revenue outturn 
was £8.532bn up from £8.180m in 2009 and in line with the consensus estimates of £8.553bn, while EBIT was up

The main Dublin shares index fell below the 3,000 level this morning with CRH and the banks leading the fall as a 
downbeat assessment of the U.S. economy by the Fed Reserve weighed on sentiment.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 4.99 points to 2,996.83.
Confidence in the prospect for economic recovery was rattled as the U.S. Federal Reserve scaled back its 
assessment of the pace of the nation's economic recovery on Thursday, taking note of pockets of weakness. It also 
issued a cautionary note about volatile financial markets in the light of Europe's debt woes. Banks were among the 
hardest hit, with Barclays, HSBC, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank off 0.9 to 2.5 percent. "We've 
started to see heightened risk aversion on the back of the Fed's comments. There is still a lot of uncertainty in terms 
of European sovereign debt and volumes are quite low," said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index in 
London. "People are scaling down their positions on concern that we might head lower. A lot of our clients are 
looking at orders between the 5,025 and the 5,050 level on the (UK's) FTSE 100 for short-term support."
Banks were weaker again with AIB down 1c to E0.99, Bank of Ireland dipped 3c to E0.72 and Irish Life and 
Permanent lost 1c to E1.64. Press reports indicate that the Polish Treasury Minister has confirmed that PKO Bank, 
the state controlled bank, would submit a non-binding offer for BZWBK - in which AIB has a major stake - next 
week. Goodbody said that, while recent speculation would indicate a reasonable number of bidders are interested 
in the asset, "we wonder whether the comments from the State have the potential to narrow down the field of 
interested parties if they perceive the State has already outlined its preferred bidder for the business". After the 
Malaga base announcement on Tuesday, Ryanair yesterday officially opened another new base, this time in 
Valencia, returning to the city two years after it departed after a falling out with the local government. Ryanair will be 
putting in 2 aircraft into the airport, which is "only" 8kms from the city. Shares in Ryanair gained 1c to E3.64. Shares

Irish shares fell back from early gains this morning to pull the ISEQ index below the 3,000 mark.
An 18.63 slide carried the index downward past the psychologically important marker to 2,983.19.
The slide was out of line with gains seen on other European markets this morning.
But it followed a fall on Wall Street last night in reaction to an admission by the Fed that the US recovery is faltering. 
Several big names showed dips, with CRH down 21 to 1814 on poor housing figures from the US. Kingspan was 
down 4c to 608. Banks were flat, with all three on the Dublin market unchanged - AIB at 100, Bank of Ireland on 75

Ryanair today announced that it will open its 43rd base at Valencia Airport in November 2010, with two based 
aircraft and 31 routes.
The announcement came following a pledge by Spanish Minster for Tourism, Belen Juste, to commit to a joint 
promotion and advertising programme to help reverse Valencia Airport's collapsing traffic, which fell by 18pc in 
2009.
In an investment of over USD140 million in the airport, Ryanair's new base will provide 260 weekly flights to and 
from Valencia.
"Ryanair welcomes the commitment from the Minister for Tourism Belen Juste who recognises that working with 
Ryanair will reverse the declining passenger numbers at Valencia Airport and grow tourism and jobs in the Valencia 
region. Ryanair's 2m passengers per annum will sustain 2,000 jobs locally at Valencia," said Ryanair's Michael 
Cawley. "We are delighted to welcome Ryanair back to Valencia and believe that by working together we can 
ensure that Valencia returns to growth. We are delighted to commit to developing a continuing programme of 
advertising and marketing that will raise Valencia's profile internationally and see many millions of high spending 
Ryanair passengers return to Valencia this year," said Minister for Tourism Belen Juste.

The main Dublin shares market fell sharply amid fears that the new regulatory regime for banks will limit their 
potential in the future and Britain, France and Germany went ahead with a bank levy.
The ISEQ fell 44.96 points to 3,076.78.
Irish shares, in line with the rest of Europe drifted lower on Tuesday after Germany, France and Britain announced 
plans today to introduce a bank levy to help meet the costs of the financial crisis, without waiting for a G20 summit 
this week, underscoring a rift with key partners.
The ISEQ also drifted lower amid fears of the type and extent of the restraints to be imposed on Irish banks by the 
new regulatory regime. The Central Bank yesterday published a policy paper on its new approach to banking 
supervision in Ireland, with the paper describing the changes underway in the Regulator's office. It picks up from the 
recent reports into the reasons for the financials crisis in Ireland and the regulatory failures that accompanied it. As 
such, it reiterated the more intrusive approach to regulation going forward, particularly for those banks receiving 
retail deposits. The paper identifies four main supervisory themes, with the CB set to publish the results of its work 
subsequently. Shares in AIB fell by 8c to E1.03, Bank of Ireland dropped 7c to E0.78 and Irish Life and Permanent 
lost 11c to E1.70. US regional bank M and T, which is part-owned by AIB, saw its shares rise again last night on 
Wall Street and was one of the best performing US banks. It now resides at USD94.45 as speculation continues to 
mount that a deal with Santander is approaching. Our base case for M and T generates E1.15bn of capital, though 
was struck at USD85 per share. Every USD10 adds about E0.2bn of capital to AIB and the market would welcome 
any progress on the disposal programme, Goodbody's analyst, Eamonn Hughes said. Shares in cider maker and 
beer brewery, C and C, rose by 6c to E3.34. Goodbody Stockbrokers said that the UK budget today looks likely to 
target the rate of duty on alcohol, with a rumoured 5pc increase mooted. However, it is not clear where cider fits into

The main Dublin shares market fell sharply amid fears that the new regulatory regime for banks will limit their 
potential in the future and Britain, France and Germany went ahead with a bank levy.
The ISEQ fell 44.96 points to 3,076.78.
Irish shares, in line with the rest of Europe drifted lower on Tuesday after Germany, France and Britain announced 
plans today to introduce a bank levy to help meet the costs of the financial crisis, without waiting for a G20 summit 
this week, underscoring a rift with key partners.
The ISEQ also drifted lower amid fears of the type and extent of the restraints to be imposed on Irish banks by the 
new regulatory regime. The Central Bank yesterday published a policy paper on its new approach to banking 
supervision in Ireland, with the paper describing the changes underway in the Regulator's office. It picks up from the 
recent reports into the reasons for the financials crisis in Ireland and the regulatory failures that accompanied it. As 
such, it reiterated the more intrusive approach to regulation going forward, particularly for those banks receiving 
retail deposits. The paper identifies four main supervisory themes, with the CB set to publish the results of its work 
subsequently. Shares in AIB fell by 8c to E1.03, Bank of Ireland dropped 7c to E0.78 and Irish Life and Permanent 
lost 11c to E1.70. US regional bank M and T, which is part-owned by AIB, saw its shares rise again last night on 
Wall Street and was one of the best performing US banks. It now resides at USD94.45 as speculation continues to 
mount that a deal with Santander is approaching. Our base case for M and T generates E1.15bn of capital, though 
was struck at USD85 per share. Every USD10 adds about E0.2bn of capital to AIB and the market would welcome 
any progress on the disposal programme, Goodbody's analyst, Eamonn Hughes said. Shares in cider maker and 
beer brewery, C and C, rose by 6c to E3.34. Goodbody Stockbrokers said that the UK budget today looks likely to 
target the rate of duty on alcohol, with a rumoured 5pc increase mooted. However, it is not clear where cider fits into

Entrepreneurs need to know when to let go
Entrepreneurs need to know when to let go
Financial Times (London, England)

Body
In the early days of EasyJet , an agitated customer telephoned the UK-based airline and demanded to speak to 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder. The customer explained that he had booked his honeymoon flights on the airline 
some months before, but the wedding was now off.
Mr Haji-Ioannou said that EasyJet had a no-refunds policy but, given the circumstances, he was prepared to relent. 
"Oh, I don't want a refund," the customer said. "I want to change the name of the person I am travelling with."
Mr Haji-Ioannou agreed and began offering an additional service: change the name of the person travelling - for a 
fee.
Sir Stelios, as he now is, told the story at a recent Financial Times event to celebrate our business school rankings. 
Afterwards, we had a laugh about the article I wrote 15 years ago, expressing scepticism about whether the newly 
launched EasyJet would make it.
Scepticism is the journalist's default position, just as optimism is the entrepreneur's. Given Sir Stelios's intelligence, 
his careful planning and the backing he had arranged through his shipping tycoon father, I was not really that 
surprised to see him turn EasyJet into one of Europe's two great cut-price airlines alongside Ryanair.
But I would have been astonished if I had been told that Sir Stelios would one day appear in the High Court in 
London, suing his own company for selling too many of those additional services. Last week, he stepped into the 
witness box to complain that EasyJet was violating the terms of its brand licence agreement, which limits the 
amount of money it can make from ancillary services to 25 per cent of income.
The case hinges on the definition of "ancillary". Are baggage charges and speedy boarding fees core or ancillary? 
In court, Sir Stelios said that even aircraft toilets were ancillary on the grounds that some small aircraft did not have 
them.
Under cross-examination, Sir Stelios conceded it would be "stupid" to charge passengers to use aircraft toilets. 
Some would apply the same description to his case. As any business school student knows, selling ancillary 
Entrepreneurs need to know when to let go
services is one of the ways budget airlines make money. Low fares are the bait to get customers to spend more - 
on food, hotels or car hire. As Sir Stelios and his siblings still own nearly 38 per cent of EasyJet, you would think he 
would want the airline to sell as many services as possible.
So what is he playing at? First, he has other interests. EasyGroup , his private company, owns and licenses the 
"easy" brand, which appears on everything from EasyCar to EasyHolidays. Ancillary offerings by EasyJet threaten 
to cramp these businesses.
Second, Sir Stelios appears to have a bad case of "founder's disease" - a reluctance to let go. Noam Wasserman of 
Harvard Business School wrote in a 2008 Harvard Business Review article : "New ventures are usually labours of 
love for entrepreneurs, and they become emotionally attached to them, referring to the business as 'my baby'." But 
from the moment founders bring in outside investors, their jobs are at risk. In an analysis of 212 US start-ups, 
Professor Wasserman discovered that by the time the ventures were three years old, 50 per cent of the founders 
were no longer chief executive. By the time of the companies' initial public offerings, only 25 per cent of the 
founders were still leading them. Most had been forced out.
Initially, Sir Stelios showed signs of avoiding founder's disease. In 2002, two years after EasyJet's stock market 
listing, he stepped down as chairman, saying entrepreneurs were not the best people to run publicly-quoted 
companies. But he has been involved in regular spats with EasyJet's board and management since, particularly 
over what he saw as the airline's over-ambitious aircraft purchasing plans . Last month he resigned from the board, 
complaining that he had been "constantly out-voted".
Some founders have avoided this fate. Sir Richard Branson has held on to his empire by, for the most part, steering 
clear of the stock markets. His Virgin Group had an unhappy period as a listed company in the 1980s before he 
took it private again - although Virgin does have minority stakes in two stock market-quoted companies, Virgin 
Media and Virgin Blue, the Australian airline.
Rupert Murdoch has kept family control of his publicly-quoted News Corp though a complex voting structure and is 
now trying to buy the 61 per cent stake his group does not already own in British Sky Broadcasting, the television 
company he created.
Sir Stelios could learn from these more seasoned business builders. He should either buy the rest of EasyJet and 
run it his way or sell out and leave its managers to run it. His baby has grown up and left home.

Video advertising is set to become the fastest growing online advertising format, according to Irish digital sales 
agency Ad2One Group Ireland.
It will, they claim, show a 78pc growth by 2012 when brands will distribute more professional-quality video content 
online as part of any advertising campaign as opposed to traditional TV Advertising.
One of the largest international third party sales agencies in the world, Ad2One Group Ireland claim that TV 
advertising will suffer as more companies are investing in the online video ads as an alternative advertising 
medium.
Online video advertising will drive greater traffic and marketers can, they say, expect a trade-off for the continued 
high CPM costs of video ad placements. According to Roddy Walshe of Ad2One Group Ireland "TV Advertising in 
Ireland will suffer, maybe not immediately, but certainly over the next three years as online video advertising is set 
to surge. The equivalent of TV advertising online video marketing is attractive because it's much cheaper and 
accurately targets key audiences without any wastage. It offers far superior targeting and offers tangible results, 
delivered through analytic tracking." His comments dovetail with the launch of Ad2OneVIRAL, is a new online 
advertising product which integrates video advertising on the most popular international websites visited by Irish 
people. YouTube is used as an integral part of the Ad2One Group Viral Service where viewers watch over 100 
videos daily every month in a rapidly escalating advertising medium which has seen a tenfold jump in the number of 
advertisers during 2009 alone. "The big challenge for marketers using online video advertising where it is tempting 
to use videos disguised as entertainment is to weave the commercial message into editorial content for greater 
impact. The onus will be therefore to focus on creative content that entices the online visitor and engages with them 
effectively," said Mr Walshe. Ad2One Group Ireland is contracted by large international sites to sell third party 
advertising which include People.com; LinkedIn; Ryanair.com and the digital versions of Hello and Marie Claire.

Video advertising is set to become the fastest growing online advertising format, according to Irish digital sales 
agency Ad2One Group Ireland.
It will, they claim, show a 78pc growth by 2012 when brands will distribute more professional-quality video content 
online as part of any advertising campaign as opposed to traditional TV Advertising.
One of the largest international third party sales agencies in the world, Ad2One Group Ireland claim that TV 
advertising will suffer as more companies are investing in the online video ads as an alternative advertising 
medium.
Online video advertising will drive greater traffic and marketers can, they say, expect a trade-off for the continued 
high CPM costs of video ad placements. According to Roddy Walshe of Ad2One Group Ireland "TV Advertising in 
Ireland will suffer, maybe not immediately, but certainly over the next three years as online video advertising is set 
to surge. The equivalent of TV advertising online video marketing is attractive because it's much cheaper and 
accurately targets key audiences without any wastage. It offers far superior targeting and offers tangible results, 
delivered through analytic tracking." His comments dovetail with the launch of Ad2OneVIRAL, is a new online 
advertising product which integrates video advertising on the most popular international websites visited by Irish 
people. YouTube is used as an integral part of the Ad2One Group Viral Service where viewers watch over 100 
videos daily every month in a rapidly escalating advertising medium which has seen a tenfold jump in the number of 
advertisers during 2009 alone. "The big challenge for marketers using online video advertising where it is tempting 
to use videos disguised as entertainment is to weave the commercial message into editorial content for greater 
impact. The onus will be therefore to focus on creative content that entices the online visitor and engages with them 
effectively," said Mr Walshe. Ad2One Group Ireland is contracted by large international sites to sell third party 
advertising which include People.com; LinkedIn; Ryanair.com and the digital versions of Hello and Marie Claire.

The ISEQ barely rose in line with world bourses amid growing hopes that more flexibility in the Chinese yuan 
exchange rate will boost confidence in the global economy.
The index rose 2.95 points to 3,121.74.
World stocks hit a five-week high, while oil and other commodities jumped on Monday after China made its 
exchange rate more flexible, easing tensions with the West and boosting confidence in the global economy. The 
euro was flat at USD1.2384 per dollar after rising earlier in the day on increased investor appetite for risky assets, 
spurred by optimism that a global recovery would boost China's buying power abroad. U.S. stocks rose in late-
morning trading as China's vow to allow a flexible yuan invigorated optimism in the global recovery and boosted the 
outlook for sales in the long term at U.S. multinationals.
In Dublin, bank shares were almost unmoved with AIB flat at E1.11 while Irish Life and Permanent was down 4c to 
E1.81 and Bank of Ireland was flat at E0.84. AIB is on track to raise some required fresh capital through disposals 
but may struggle to minimise state ownership by selling in an uncertain market, the Central Bank's head of banking 
supervision said on Monday. The Government told the banks in March that they must find at least E22 billion by the 
end of 2010 to plug the holes left from transferring risky property loans to a "bad bank" scheme and to meet new 
regulatory requirements. According to the latest analysis by ARTBA (American Road Transportation Builders 
Association), over a third of stimulus funds have now been paid to US contractors for highway construction. Some 
USD9.1bn has been spent, which puts the monthly increase above the dollar 1bn mark for the first time this year, 
thereby continuing the upward trend in this series. However, highway / bridge contract awards data show that there 
was a decline of 26pc in May (-19pc highways and -44pc bridges). "This is a bit of a surprise given the positive 
momentum with stimulus funds and we will therefore, be watching subsequent months data closely as it could be an 
indication of funding pressures at a state/local level. CRH has one of the biggest exposures to the US (over 57pc of 
ISEQ flat as banks shares turn weaker; ISEQ Flat
group profits), it is a key beneficiary of spending on highways," said Goodbody's. Shares in CRH gained 13c to 
E19.68. Aer Lingus released a trading update, in conjunction with its AGM, indicating that it continues to trade 
ahead of the same period in 2009. This is helped by its cost programme and it commented that it is more disciplined 
on yields this year. Shares in the airline were down 1c at E0.75 while Ryanair dropped by 10c to E3.67. Celesio has 
announced that it has created a new joint venture with Medco to provide clinical care services in the European 
market, similar to that announced by Dublin's United Drug (with Medco) for the UK market. Shares in United Drug 
rose 3c to E2.27.

The ISEQ rose in line with world bourses this morning amid growing hopes that more flexibility in the Chinese yuan 
exchange rate will boost confidence in the global economy.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had risen by 28.05 points to 3,146.84.
World stocks hit a five-week high, oil jumped and the euro rose briefly on Monday after China pledged at the 
weekend to unshackle the yuan, easing tensions with the West and boosting confidence in the global economy. 
Spot yuan climbed to its highest level against the dollar since its last revaluation in July 2005 in a clear signal that 
Beijing was sticking to its word that it would allow greater currency flexibility. Coming just days before a Group of 20 
summit in Toronto, China's move would boost purchasing power and demand in the world's third largest economy, 
encouraging investors globally to buy risky assets. A higher yuan would also help temper inflation in China by 
pushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijing would have less need to tighten monetary policy 
aggressively.
In Dublin, bank shares were mostly in the black with AIB gaining 5c to E1.17 and Irish Life and Permanent up 10c to 
E1.95 while Bank of Ireland dropped by 1c to E0.84. According to the latest analysis by ARTBA (American Road

Staycity plans expansion with three new locations

Staycity, the Irish provider of serviced accommodation for European city breaks, is in talks to open in three new 
locations, after opening its seventh site in Manchester this month.
Tom Walsh, chief executive of Staycity, said that initial business from the new base was positive. However, he 
warned that tourist patterns in Dublin were the poorest in Staycity's portfolio, which includes Amsterdam, Paris, 
Rome, Birmingham and Liverpool.
''Dublin continues to disappoint in a big way, with visitor numbers to the city in steep decline," said Walsh, who 
operates more than 700 serviced apartments across Europe as a flexible alternative to hotel accommodation for 
tourists and business travellers.
He said the government's controversial  10 tax on visitors, which has been criticised by Ryanair and Aer Lingus, 
should be scrapped. Walsh remained upbeat about Staycity's non-Irish business.
''The star performer is Paris, and the British cities are holding their own well," he said. Staycity will open an eighth 
base in Portsmouth next year and is also working on establishing sites in London, Glasgow and Bristol.
Walsh said the company, which was founded in 2004, was on track to become one of the top five providers of 
serviced accommodation in Europe within five years. It plans to operate more than 3,000 units by 2015 and is 
seeking to concentrate on Britain and France.
Walsh expects to add significant capacity in Paris and London and target other major cities in each market.
The company is 20 per cent owned by Irelandia Investments, the investment vehicle owned by the family of the late 
Tony Ryan, the Ryanair founder.

Christoph Mueller had his first formal outing in front of Aer Lingus shareholders last week, as the airline held its first 
agm since he replaced Dermot Mannion as chief executive.
Now almost a year into the job, Mueller has done much to distinguish his regime from that of his predecessor.
Mueller has signalled a dramatic shift in the airline's protracted war on bloated costs since taking over, winning 
plaudits for successfully introducing a wide-ranging cost reduction programme that will aim to boost the bottom line 
by upto  100 million per year.
That he managed to achieve this by facing down stubborn union resistance, without flinching, has gone a long way 
to establishing the new chief executive as a serious candidate to finally implement long overdue changes at the 
former state airline, which was privatised in 2006.
Mueller has also taken steps to protect and increase the revenue line with a low-profile, though no less dramatic, 
change to Aer Lingus's pricing strategy. He surprised some observers earlier this year with a calculated risk aimed 
at extricating Aer Lingus from an unwinnable price war with rival Ryanair on its short-haul routes.
Having ruled out a continuation of Aer Lingus's previous strategy as a pure low cost, low-fares operator, on the 
grounds that this was ''not sustainable'', Mueller also decided against fleeing to the full-service, premium-pricing 
alternative, as he figured this would be uncompetitive in a market in which the concept of cheap flights had become 
ingrained among Irish air travellers.
But the hybrid model - one of a low-cost service ''with a little extra'' - is not without its pitfalls.
In seeking the best of both worlds - higher prices without conceding on passenger numbers - Mueller's strategy ran 
the risk of being hopelessly optimistic.
Mueller's steady touch bears fruit
The numbers so far, however, suggest not. Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington delivered an upbeat trading 
statement to last week's agm, that revealed a relatively resilient performance in the early part of the summer.
A trading update released last month had shown Mueller had halved operating losses in the first three months of 
2010, and had also reduced the deficit to  38 million, from  75 million a year earlier.
The most comforting feature of the losses was that revenues had fallen by just 2 per cent, even though capacity 
was down 10 per cent, while operating costs were 134 per cent lower as cost initiatives and lower fuel prices kicked 
in.
Last week, however, Barrington had further positive news on trading during the months of April and May, which he 
said was ahead of the same months last year. ''This performance reflects the benefits of a disciplined approach to 
yield management and a continuing focus on cost reduction," he said.
Despite the disruption triggered by volcanic ash cloud, which played havoc with airline schedules and resulted in 
widespread flight cancellations, Barrington appeared pleased with the performance overseen by the chief executive 
he had chosen.
Passenger numbers so far in 2010 appear to have vindicated Mueller's decision to abandon the policy of filling 
seats on short-haul routes, even if giveaway prices are necessary to do so.
Mueller justified the move earlier this year on the basis that heavy discounting meant Aer Lingus was charging 
many passengers less than they would actually be prepared to pay. The gamble of tweaking prices appears to be 
working - on the surface, at least - by delivering better revenues without a significant fall-off in passengers.
But the true test of the policy will only come during the critical summer trading period.
Barrington kicked for touch at the agm, saying ''it is appropriate to remain cautious'' on the full year performance, 
notwithstanding the encouraging patterns in the first five months.
The airline has noted ''a modest decrease'' in forward bookings for the summer on short-haul routes, although 
Mueller said last week that this could have been down to the volcanic ash episodes discouraging passengers from 
making their summer bookings until closer to their expected departure dates.
He may worry that more far reaching factors are at play, however. Ryanair's ever-present competitive threat 
continues to plague Aer Lingus, with Michael O'Leary's airline maintaining its strategy of aggressive price 
discounting to keep its planes full. The sheer strength of Mueller's main competitor was displayed by its recent 
announcement that it would splash out  500million - more than Aer Lingus's entire market capitalisation - in cash 
dividends to shareholders later in the year.
At a time when most airlines, including Aer Lingus, are scrambling to preserve their cash balances in a tough 
trading environment, Mueller may envy his peer's difficulty in finding a use for  500 million that it does not need.
As if to highlight the airlines' contrasting fortunes, Aer Lingus once again told shareholders last week that a dividend 
payment would have to wait for a long time to come.
In the meantime, Mueller must grapple with the challenges common to all airline chief executives - flagging 
demand, constant pressure to reduce costs and the threat of another oil price spike - while coping with those that 
are unique to him.
These include a near-total reliance on the Irish economy, a faltering market for inbound tourists and the fact that, 
alone among European airlines, he must struggle with head-to head competition from Ryanair on the vast majority 
of his short-haul routes, as well as his biggest shareholder's ability to block certain initiatives.
Mueller's steady touch bears fruit
While the recent move to suspend transatlantic services from Shannon during the winter months suggests that 
Mueller has succeeded in proving that there are no sacred cows left within his organisation, he may worry that it is 
the external factors, which he cannot change, that may yet dictate his success or failure.
This summer will make for an interesting test.

BMW3 series convertible invites the sun

Cometh the summer, cometh the car! The arrival of the recent fine weather spell brought with it temporary 
possession of the revisedBMW3 Series Convertible.
The test 320d model came in alpine white with a red Dakota leather interior. It incorporated Stop-Start technology-
saving fuel and emissions at traffic lights - a gear change indicator light and so on. Earlier this year, the range got a 
mid-life facelift, which brought further detail improvements, including engine upgrades.
Previous generations of the convertible used a fabric roof but, from 2006, the new model has a three piece 
articulating metallic roof.
While this system does have the advantage of giving the solidity and security of a saloon, it has the drawback of 
taking up a lot of boot space when folded down.
In this state, think of bringing in a slim-line bag of Ryanair dimensions, rather than the more generous size allowed 
by Lufthansa or Delta.
However, when the roof is in the raised position, the available luggage space is then quite spacious, easily sufficient 
to fit in a week's shopping or the gear needed for a weekend in Kerry or Donegal.
Naturally enough, passenger accommodation is compromised a little too, when one compares the open roof car to 
its saloon sibling. Front seat passengers have all the room required, but the rear compartment, configured very 
stylishly for two, lacks both leg room and head room for those above about 5' 9'', so it is best reserved for children. 
Also, the rear seatbacks are quite hard and upright.
That apart, this area is very well laid out, with a spacious central tunnel equipped with cup holders and a cubby with 
a sliding lid, not to mention carefully sculpted elbow rests to the sides. It's a nice place - just don't be too tall!
BMW3 series convertible invites the sun
All convertibles suffer to a greater or lesser extent from wind turbulence in the passenger compartment when the 
roof is down. Some are worse than others - the Lexus IS cabriolet is particularly good in this respect - so, different 
make r s take different approaches to ameliorating the problem.
Some, like VW in the Eos and Mercedes in its latest E-Class cabriolet, fit air deflector devices to the top of the 
windscreen rail, while others use a folding screen/net which can be mounted over the rear seats.
BMW is in the net camp, but unfortunately this was missing from the test car so, sadly, the roof had to be closed on 
a long motorway trip, as the breeze becomes uncomfortable above about 80km/h without the screen in place.
As part of the revisions to the 3 Series range for 2010, the engine line-up was given a range of detail improvements.
In the case of the 1995cc turbo diesel engine under the bonnet of the test car, the result is an increase of 7bhp and 
30Nm, giving the overall maximum output figures of 184bhp and 380Nm.
The test car was fitted with the company's six-speed manual gearbox, so the emissions figure is 135g/km, giving 
Band B tax rating.
Getting the tin-opener to a car calls for extra reinforcement to body and chassis so that the resultant opening-roof 
model will be sturdy, rattle-free and retain fine dynamic characteristics.
Unfortunately, this incurs a weight penalty and when you compare a 320d saloon to a 320d convertible, the extra 
burden is 225kg.
While this takes the edge off the performance to some extent and raises fuel consumption too, recent technology 
improvements still mean that the convertible delivers very respectable figures.
Top speed is quoted at 230km/h, while the car takes 8.3 seconds to accelerate from rest to 100km/h, compared to 
7.5 seconds for the four door model. Flexibility is a strong suit of this engine, so, once on the move and the revs 
above 1600rpm, gear changing is not that often called for.
This was evident on motorways too. With the cruise control set at the legal limit of 120km/k and the car travelling in 
sixth gear, it would quickly and effortlessly regain speed from 80km/h.A ll that was required was a press on the 
'resume' button.
Dynamically, the latest 3 Series convertible gives a good account of itself. While the steering was quite stiff and 
heavy at parking speeds, it freed up nicely as speeds rose to give satisfactory accuracy, turn-in and feedback. 
Driven on the same country road that proved challenging for another car a few weeks ago, this model behaved 
much better, never scraping off the tarmac.
On bumpy roads, there was certainly some hardness to the ride, even brittleness at times.
However, given any sort of decent surface, the car behaved well. Note that this model came on regular tubeless 
tyres. Thankfully, BMW's love affair with run-flat tyres - with their extraordinarily stiff side walls - seems to be fading 
into the past. The brakes are strong and reassuring, while the Stop&Start system was one of the best I've tested on 
a diesel engine.
The 320d convertible is not cheap, with a standard price of  50,500, which includes the fine 17 inch star-spoke alloy 
wheels. However, the rivals from Mercedes-Benz (the more spacious E-Class convertible) Audi and Lexus come in 
the same general range.
Extras on the test model brought this figure up to  53,534.Mostof these one could live without, though the Bluetooth 
connection is a good idea, despite the sting of  932 which it brings.
Life with a convertible always requires compromise, but when the sky is blue and the sun shines brightly, there is no 
better place to be if you have to get behind the wheel.

Ryanair has introduced an optional larger checked baggage allowance of 20kg, offering travellers a more affordable 
way of transporting luggage on its no-frills flights.
Passengers can now choose between a standard 15kg one-bag allowance, costing 15 euro online and a higher 
20kg one-bag allowance, costing 25 euro.
The new option will be a money-saver for people who check in bags weighing 16 - 20kg, as they will no longer face 
excess baggage fees for exceeding 15kg.
However, the per-kilo fee will still apply to any bags weighing more than 20kg, so Ryanair customers are advised to 
weigh their baggage before arriving at the airport. Passengers who require a second checked-in bag can purchase 
an additional 15kg allowance for 35 euro. However, in July and August, the basic charges are due to rise to 20 euro 
for a 15kg bag, and 30 euro for a 20kg bag. The price of checking-in an additional bag will then rise to 40 euro. 
Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said passengers could purchase the checked-in baggage allowances at 
the time of booking or subsequently through Manage My Booking on ryanair.com.

Body
Ryanair today blamed the Government's E10 travel tax and the DAA's charges for a 32pc fall in passenger numbers 
through Dublin Airport in April.
Traffic at Dublin Airport fell by over 550,000 passengers in April, due to the volcanic ash disruption, but fell by more 
than 650,000 in the first three months of the year due to the Govt's E10 tourist tax and high charges at the DAA 
monopoly airport, the airline said.
Dublin Airport's traffic is now on track to fall under 18 million passengers in 2010, having already collapsed in 2009 
to 20.5 million from 23.5 million (in 2008).
"At a time when many other EU countries (Holland and Belgium) have scrapped tourist taxes, or slashed airport 
fees (Spain) and have returned to growth, the Irish Govt's E10 tourist tax and their imposed 40pc price increase at 
Dublin Airport have devastated Irish traffic and tourism. Irish tourism can return to growth but only when this tourist 
tax is scrapped and the DAA's price increases are reversed," Ryanair said. "This month the excuse from the Govt 
for the collapse in traffic at Ireland's gateway airport will be much easier than the usual lies about it being an 
'international phenomenon' - they will just blame the volcano. But even an unprecedented natural disaster can not 
compete with the disastrous effect the Govt's E10 tourist tax has had on Irish tourism. While the volcano caused the 
loss of over 550,000 passengers in April, the Govt's E10 tax and high charges at the DAA monopoly trumps that 
number with over 650,000 passengers lost in the first three months of the year," Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said. 
"The solution to Ireland's tourism crisis is clear. The Govt must now scrap the E10 tourist tax and reverse the DAA's 
40pc price increases in 2010. It is extraordinary that Dublin Airport is losing over 650,000 passengers in Q1 when 
Ryanair continues to grow. Ryanair has offered to grow routes and traffic into Ireland but the DAA couldn't be 
bothered to even talk to us about it. It's time to axe the E10 tourist tax and break up the DAA monopoly as well."

Willie Walsh, known in the airline industry as a tough fighter, has led British Airways into a 16-month dispute with 
cabin crew that shows little sign of ending. At the same time, the Irish-born manager has negotiated a merger with 
Spain's Iberia.
Edited highlights of a video interview with FT.com appear below.
Why are you pursuing this strike at the moment to the bitter end? I don't see it as the bitter end. It's important to 
point out that the vast majority of cabin crew have actually continued to work. But it's absolutely critical to BA that 
we address the inefficiency in our business.
What kind of change in culture do you want to see? We've got to make immediate savings to compensate for the 
significant downturn in revenue that we've seen. But more importantly, we've got to have a cost base that's 
competitive, and that isn't the case at BA or it certainly wasn't the case.
But you've largely agreed on the cost savings. People don't really know what the dispute is about now.
The issue really is translating an agreement in principle into changes in behaviour and changes in work practices. 
I've been involved in industrial relations for almost 30 years, and I recognise that the most important part of any 
deal is implementation.
What will you do if there is a new ballot? VIDEO ON FT.COM Watch the full video of the interview at: 
www.ft.com/view I will do anything and everything within the law to ensure that BA can continue to fly. So the 
message to our customers is that BA will continue to fly. The trade union has failed in its objective to ground BA.
Aren't you worried about losing some core corporate customers? No, I'm not. My sole worry is about long-term 
viability. These customers want to see BA succeed. We've had fantastic support from our corporates and fantastic 
support from our regular customers.
Could you sack the striking crew? The question I think is irrelevant, because we've demonstrated that we can 
succeed in operating our schedules with the cabin crew who are coming to work.
View from the top: Willie Walsh Chief executive, British Airways
When did you last go on holiday? I haven't taken a holiday in just over five years [since becoming BA chief 
executive]. But I love my work.
I'm loving my job at BA.
What's the point of being a full-cost, premium airline when you often treat passengers a bit like Ryanair does? We 
don't treat passengers like Ryanair.
People talk about poorer service.
Our customer service standards have risen. Our operational performance has increased.
On baggage, for example, it seems you're counting each kilo and each pound and applying rules very strictly 
instead of using common sense.
The issue that caused many of my customers to complain directly to me was one day the people didn't charge them 
when they should have, and the next day they were charged. Now the problem there is: that's inconsistent, so the 
customer is confused. What we've said is that's unfair to customers.
Does it make sense to merge with Iberia, another former state-owned airline with highly paid crew? It makes sense 
to pursue consolidation in this industry. Iberia has got a fantastic network in Latin America.

Michael Moriarty has been the N general secretary of the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) since 1997.
The IVEA represents the interests of Ireland's 33 Vocational Education Communities (VECs), which deliver an 
extensive range of educational programmes across second level, adult and further education, community 
education, youth work schemes and adult literacy schemes.
Moriarty started his career as a teacher, before taking on the role of chief executive of Carlow-Kildare Radio in the 
late 1980s. He is currently an appointed member of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. The 55-year-old lives in 
Carlow and has one daughter, Siofra.
What's the best investment you ever made? My holiday home in Dingle, Kerry, where I am at my happiest.
What was the worst investment you ever made?
My first motorbike, of which every moving part fell off within a year. I learned an early lesson - buyer beware. Which 
investment options do you currently favour?
In a world of investment turmoil, I fancy shares in Ryanair.
Michael O'Leary's strong leadership and clear vision enhance that feeling of security.
Do you own your own home or other investment property?
I own my own home and a holiday home.
What type of car do you have?
I drive a Hyundai Sonata, a vastly underrated car, utterly dependable and reliable. All the comforts for thousands of 
euro less than comparable cars. A smart investment for discerning investors.
Pocket Watch
What was the best financial advice you ever received?
Borrow money only to purchase what appreciates - advice I completely ignored.
What financial advice would you give to someone starting in a career?
Don't always submit to peer pressure to buy the latest and most expensive gadget.
Avoid bank debt for as long as possible and invest as soon as possible in property, which is currently great value.
When you started your career, if you had the financial knowledge you now have, would you have done things 
differently?
I would not have accumulated early debt in buying cars and changing models so often.
I should have saved more.
Do you have a pension? Yes.
Do you invest in equities or equity-based funds?
I have done, but not any more.
Did you open an SSIA? If so, what did you do with the proceeds?
Yes. I paid off some debts and spent the balance on a good foreign holiday.
Are you a saver or a spender?
I admit to being more of a spender than a saver.
What's your top financial priority?
Keeping my head above water financially and hoping to have my mortgages and bank debt cleared before 
retirement.
How would you describe your attitude to your personal finances?
I certainly don't micromanage them, but generally review priorities about twice a year. I do so with a renewed zeal 
to commit myself to rigorous financial scrutiny, only to lapse into old ways.
Have you made any changes to your personal spending habits as a result of the current economic environment?
I will not change my car every two to three years, but will more likely keep it for five years. Foreign holidays will be 
far less frequent, as will eating out.
If you were the Minister for Finance for a day and could change one thing, what would it be?
I would invest heavily in new training programmes to be operated by VECs for people of all ages, at all skill levels, 
because upskilling those currently unemployed will be key to the economic regeneration of Ireland.
If you had all the money you could wish for, what three things would you buy?
An offshore Irish island with derelict cottages to restore and convert into a visitors' centre to commemorate a lost 
community and a luxury retirement home, so that people who have worked hard all their lives can enjoy their golden 
years in comfortable serenity.

The two reports into the background to the property and banking crisis did not aim to identify or single out 
individuals.
They set about identifying the key areas where there were shortcomings which contributed to the crisis that has 
cost Irish taxpayers tens of billions of euro.
The reports also separated out the extent to which international factors contributed to the boom/bust and how much 
was due to domestic ''home-grown'' factors. Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan refuted the claim that the crisis 
was a result of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
''If we hadn't had the Lehmans collapse, we still would have had a banking crisis of our own. Anglo Irish Bank would 
not have survived, with or without Lehmans going," he said last week.
Among the groups that made mistakes, according to the reports, were the bank executives who over-lent, the bank 
directors who failed to control the over-lending, the government for its fiscal policies fuelling property speculation, 
and the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.
Many of the bank directors and chief executives who were in charge between 2003 and 2007 - when the big 
mistakes were made - are no longer on the scene, although some are still in place. And many politicians and former 
public servants who held key positions at that time either retired with handsome financial packages or continue in 
office.
Bertie Ahern: Taoiseach from 1997 to 2007, the policies of his government are sharply criticised in the reports.
Still a TD, he earns a salary of  83,000 per year and had been collecting a Taoiseach's pension worth  98,000 per 
year until earlier this year when he agreed to forgo it.
The ongoing price of paying for their mistakes
Brian Cowen: Taoiseach since 2007, he was minister for finance from 2004 to 2007, a key period when mistakes 
were made.
He currently earns  228,000 per year, having had it cut from  285,000. On retirement, he will be entitled to a 
Taoiseach's pension of around  100,000 and a TD pension of around  53,000 per year.
Charlie McCreevy: McCreevy was minister for finance from 1997 until 2004.
When he left, he became Ireland's EU Commissioner until he retired last year.
During his five years as EU Commissioner he earned more than  1.4 million, including a salary of  238,000 and a  
35,000 residence allowance.
Upon retirement he receives a  537,000 step down payment over a three year period to ease into the loss of salary. 
He will receive a  51,000 per year EU Commissioner pension on top of his  70,000 a year ministerial pension and 
his  52,000 per year TD pension.
He recently joined the board of Ryanair as a non-executive director which pays around  32,000 per year.
John Hurley: former governor of the Central Bank, he held the post from 2001 until September 2009. The Central 
Bank is criticised in the Honohan report during the period that Hurley was in charge.
Hurley was due to retire in March last year, but was asked to stay an extra six months by Brian Lenihan. Hurley 
received a payment on retirement of  525,000 and will receive a pension of around  175,000 a year.
Patrick Neary: Neary was chief executive of the Financial Regulator from late 2005 to 2008. His organisation is 
heavily criticised in the report.
When he retired early, he received a  428,000 lump sum payment and a further  202,000 early retirement payment. 
He receives pension of  143,000 a year.
Liam O'Reilly: he was the first chief executive of the Financial Regulator, holding the job from 2003 until late 2005.
This includes part of the period for which the regulator is criticised in the Honohan report. O'Reilly's pension is 
around  140,000 per year. In 2008 he joined the board of Irish Life and Permanent, for which he received  78,000 in 
2009.
He is also a director of Merrill Lynch International.
Eugene Sheehy: chief executive of AIB from 2005 to 2009. He earned  2.1 million in 2007 and  1.15 million in 2008. 
His pension is around  450,000 a year. He spent  2.8 million buying AIB shares in August 2008 which have lost 
90per cent of their value.
Brian Goggin: chief executive of Bank of Ireland from 2004 to 2009. Remuneration peaked at  3.1 million in 2007 
and his pension is around  650,000 per year.
Michael Fingleton: the former chief executive of Irish Nationwide was paid over  1 million a year. Received a bonus 
payment of  1 million for staying on in the job beyond March 2009. His pension pot was  27 million in 2007.
Sean FitzPatrick: the former chief executive and chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, his multimillion euro fortune has 
been wiped out by the economic collapse. He still owed the bank  87 million when he resigned in December 2008.
Only two lenders have had 100 per cent clear-outs of all directors who were on boards before 2007, when most of 
the mistakes had been made.
Some directors remain on boards despite holding the positions during the years for which Honohan has criticised 
lending practices.
The ongoing price of paying for their mistakes
At AIB this includes Colm Doherty, managing director of the bank, appointed to the board in 2003; Kieran Crowley, 
who was appointed to the AIB board in 2004; and Robert Wilmers, who has been on the AIB board since 2003.
At Bank of Ireland it includes Richie Boucher, chief executive, who was appointed to the board in 2006; fellow 
executives Des Crowley (2006), Denis Donovan (2006) and John O'Donovan (2002). Other Bank of Ireland 
directors include Paul Haran, appointed in 2005 and Denis Holt, appointed in 2006.
At EBS it includes Barbara Patton and Cathal Magee, the new chief executive of the Health Service Executive, who 
were both appointed in 2002.
At Irish Life & Permanent it includes chairwoman Gillian Bowler (1998), Breffni Byrne (2004), Eamonn Heffernan 
(2003), Roy Keenan (2006) and Danuta Gray (2004). Irish Life has not required state re-capitalisation, but its 
shares have fallen by over 90per cent.

The Parting Glass
By Dermot Bolger
National tour, until July 17
Rating: ****
There's a danger that the very marketing of The Par ting Glass may work against it: it's promoted as ''a journey 
measured out in soccer matches'' and courts Celtic tiger fallout fatigue by taking as its topic the economic hardship 
of the 1980s, followed by the boom times, followed by the bust.
But to disregard this play because of its billing would be to disregard a remarkable piece of storytelling.
Dublin playwright, novelist and poet Dermot Bolger's new play draws together all these subjects in a one-man show 
which is an astute profile of pre and post-Celtic tiger Ireland.
Axis Arts Centre director Ray Yeates plays Eoin, a likeable middleaged man who has returned to Ireland with his 
German wife and son after emigrating 20 years previously.
The play begins in an airport waiting area (designed by artist Robert Ballagh),where Eoin is travelling home, 
dejected after witnessing Thierry Henry's deliberate handball which forced Ireland out of this year's World Cup 
finals.
From here he recalls the many experiences which led him to that fateful match, and offers his thoughts on the 
unknown future that awaits him in Ireland.
STAGE
As with his 1990 play, In High Germany, Bolger uses sport as a metaphor for his story. That play, which was 
narrated by a much younger Eoin (also performed by Yeates), told of three economic migrants forced to leave 
Ireland.
This sequel to the 1990 play explores the intervening two decades of his character's life in the context of the social 
changes of the time. Director Mark O'Brien maintains an unflagging pace, while Yeates's performance is engaging 
and understated.
He carries the audience on waves of humour, eliciting familiar emotions and at times, surprise.
Conleth White's effective lighting provides necessary changes in ambiance. In less competent hands, jabs at the 
likes of Ryanair, Eamon Dunphy, Anglo Irish Bank and Sean FitzPatrick could appear hackneyed.
Bolger, however, has a poet's pithiness and a sharp wit. He balances skilfully his observations of Irish society with a 
succinct and accessible script.
The Parting Glass continues its tour to the Mill Theatre, Dundrum, Dublin 14 (June 24); Mermaid Arts Centre, Bray, 
Co Wicklow (July 2); Chadwicks Theatre as part of Clonmel Junction Festival, Co Tipperary (July 9, 10) and Civic 
Theatre, Tallaght, Dublin 24 (July 13-17). It will also travel to New York for the Underground Zero Festival (July 21-
25)

EasyJet brand dispute looms
EasyJet brand dispute looms

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou begins his fight in the High Court on Monday with EasyJet, which he founded 15 years ago, 
in a brand dispute which could have far reaching implications for the airline.
The case, set to last two weeks, may also expose boardroom tensions at EasyJet as the High Court hears 
arguments on the meaning of a brand licence agreement made when the airline floated in 2000 which limits the 
amount it can make from so-called ancillary services to 25 per cent of total income.
The court is expected to hear evidence from Sir Stelios, the airline's biggest shareholder, and Andy Harrison, 
EasyJet's outgoing chief executive.
The brand licence agreement - for which Sir Stelios is paid royalties of £1 a year - was made to ensure that EasyJet 
did not turn into a conglomerate that could swamp his EasyGroup businesses, including EasyCar.
EasyGroup owns the "easy" brand and licenses it to other ventures as well as to EasyJet. If Sir Stelios wins the 
case, EasyJet could be be liable to pay him additional royalties.
The High Court case is likely to centre on whether baggage charges, speedy boarding charges and sandwiches 
sold on board are ancillary services or core services.
Sir Stelios has argued that the airline is above the 25 per cent limit on ancillary revenues due to growth in these 
types of services.
He has asked the court to determine the issue so an audit can be carried out, examining whether the limit has been 
breached.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that Sir Stelios is fighting a second legal battle. He is suing rival Ryanair and its chief 
executive Michael O'Leary for libel over an advertisement published by Ryanair in January and February.
EasyJet brand dispute looms
In a claim form filed in the High Court, Sir Stelios alleges his nose was "digitally altered" in the photograph used in 
the advert "so as to grotesquely elongate its tip" which "is immediately reminiscent and/or evocative of the well-
known children's character, Pinocchio, whose nose famously grew every time he told a lie".
The writ claims: "The depiction of someone's nose lengthening in this way is therefore synonymous in the minds of 
the public with his being a liar."
Sir Stelios, who is being represented by libel lawyers Schillings, claims that the words and photograph of the advert 
in their ordinary meaning or by way of innuendo "meant and were understood to mean that the claimant had 
deliberately and dishonestly chosen to stop publication of 'on-time' statistics on the EasyJet website".
According to the writ, Sir Stelios is seeking unlimited damages as well as an injunction to prevent the words being 
re-published.

The Commission could also ask the carriers, which notified European Union regulators of their merger plans the 
previous day, to provide concessions -- such as giving up airport slots -- to ease possible concerns that the deal 
may dent competition.
The airlines aim to complete the merger by December and hope it will enable them to compete better with rivals 
Lufthansa and Air France as well as Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair.
It will also clear the way for a tie-up with American Airlines. The Commission, competition watchdog of the 27-

by 35 working days if it has concerns or if the two carriers offer concessions.

Ontario-based Vac Aero.
PARA::Since April 2009, Lufthansa's regional arm has been flying five times a week to Rzeszow from Frankfurt, 
connecting the tiny airport to much of the world, including Rush's local hub Toronto. The sole connections had been 
on national carrier LOT via Warsaw and a daily Ryanair flight to London Stansted.
PARA::Aviation Valley now wants to attract a freight specialist to the airport, allowing the region's manufacturers 
quicker access to the global supply chain. Currently, aircraft parts travel by truck on southern Poland's tortuous 
road network to airports such as Warsaw or Munich, although new north-south and east-west highways being

It was good news all round for Ryanair last week.
The company was delighted with its meteoric rise in pretax profit to  341 million in the year to March 2010. 
Shareholders were pleased to learn they would receive a  500 million dividend payout later this year - the 
company's first.
And Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the airline, will have been mightily pleased that he is to receive  20 million 
of that and a possible further  20 million when an anticipated second payout arrives in 2013.
The  20 million special dividend for O'Leary is roughly equal to the increase in the value of his 4 per cent stake in 
the company in the last week. O'Leary has 60 million shares currently valued at  216 million -  18.6 million more 
than a week ago.
But does the special dividend have a further longer-term implication for the low-cost airline? Is Ryanair growing up?
Ryanair didn't pay out dividends in the past because of the opportunity cost of what it could have done with the 
money by way of aggressive expansion.
The airline now looks set to pause for breath in the expansion stakes.
It is in a position to continue to grow and increase profits sharply, while also paying out some dividends.
But perhaps this marks the beginning of a new phase in the history of Ryanair, the beginning of a change from a 
youthful, rapid-growth, expansionary company to one which is in a position to reap some of the fruits of its past 
labours.
With nearly a quarter of its revenues last year coming from ancillary items like baggage charges, in-flight sales and 
other online sales, the company is certainly changing.
The Inquisitor
The big question is whether a richer, but slightly more pedestrian, Ryanair will be one with which O'Leary will be 
equally engaged.
Will he find the absence of protracted aircraft purchase negotiations, court battles and secret talks about new hubs 
a little boring?
He has signalled in the past that, at some point, Ryanair would become a different kind of company and that might 
be the time for him to consider moving on. It certainly hasn't reached that point yet, but last week's announcement 
may signal the beginning of a less exciting but, all the same, a very interesting phase for Ryanair.

Ryanair's extra charges might drive its customers mad, but they accounted for almost one in every four euro the 
low-cost airline made last year.
Baggage charges, in-flight sales and other ''ancillary revenue'' apart from fares accounted for  663 million of the 
company's turnover in the 12 months to March 2010.
The charges - which Ryanair says allow it to charge lower air fares - accounted for 22.5 per cent of its total  2.98 
billion of turnover.
This is the highest percentage of total turnover ever to come from these alternative forms of income at the airline.
Ryanair earned an average of  9.97 per passenger from ancillary revenues - down from  10.19 the previous year.
The airline said ancillary revenues grew at a slower rate than passenger numbers, due to ''a 2 per cent decline in 
average spend per passenger, primarily due to lower excess baggage revenues, and the adverse impact of the 
euro/sterling exchange rates''.
This suggests passengers are getting more astute at avoiding excess baggage charges, which have been a source 
of controversy. Average fares paid per customer also came down, lending some support to the company's claims 
about the role of ancillary revenues. But Ryanair critics argue that many ancillary revenues are not really optional, 
and therefore constitute hidden charges.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary joked about the baggage charges last week when asked how he would spend his  
20 million special dividend payment. ''About  12 million gets paid in tax to the Irish government.
Of the remaining, my wife will take about four, and the balance will go on paying Ryanair's check-in fees and 
excess baggage fees on the O'Learys' family holiday."

40-hour week.
He is one of a growing number of Irish professionals who pack their bags on a Sunday night for a week's work in 
Britain, and return to Ireland on Friday.
Welcome to the world of the long-distance commuter. They can navigate Dublin Airport with their eyes closed. Their 
idea of hell is heading out for a restaurant meal or spending a night in a hotel. And when an ash cloud descends 
they can't get to work.
It may be exhausting to live and work in one country on weekdays and fly home at weekends, but cheap flights and 
the proximity of a major economy means it is on the increase.
Small communities of these long-distance commuters meet on red-eye flights on a Monday morning and again on a 
Friday afternoon. Ryanair, Aer Lingus and CityJet flights have become a latter day Lilac Bus. Like Maeve Binchy's 
fictional minibus, they bring workers home to their roots at weekends.
McLoughlin, a director of a cost consultancy firm, has been on the Monday red-eye flight routine since last July. He 
knows the importance of an aisle seat, and the hazards of too many hotel dinners. He can pack a bag in a flash - 
and recently watched Up in the Air, a movie about a travelling executive (George Clooney), with more than a hint of 
recognition.
''I did a year of this ten years ago and unfortunately there isn't any choice," he says. ''I'd be a fairly large overhead 
on the firm sat in the Irish office twiddling my thumbs, so the fact that I and four of my senior colleagues are working 
abroad means that we'll meet our targets this year."
Red-eye rovers
When he compares notes with colleagues on the same treadmill, they agree that the lifestyle is not ideal, but it's the 
least worst option.
''We are fortunate that the firm, Franklin and Andrews, is part of a global business employing 14,000 people.
''You think things are bad and you don't like it and you miss your family, but when you come home at weekends and 
see what's happening here you think, 'I'd rather be working'. Ultimately, that's the bottom line."
Engineer Justine Butler has just finished a 15-month working stint in Wales. Her firm, DPS Engineering, was 
contracted to design and manage the construction of a pharmaceutical plant in the town of Wrexham. ''Getting the 
flights became like getting a bus.
You had your timings down to the minimum, checking in online and bringing only hand luggage," she says. Butler 
flew weekly to Liverpool.
Having other colleagues who had been there for a year meant she was able to find a temporary home quickly. 
''They knew the best estate agent, and all about the area."
She lived in an apartment in Chester in England, and carefully planned everything - from the supermarket trip on 
the way to work on Monday to working late midweek - in order to be able to fly home to Dublin on a Friday. She 
spent four to five weekends in Chester but, otherwise, home life at weekends was in the family home in Clontarf, 
Dublin.
''At first it was quite difficult and I used to be so tired flying back and forth. In the beginning, I definitely felt that I 
didn't live in the country. My time management skills became very good and I made sure to make arrangements to 
see friends at weekends. At first, some people didn't know whether I'd be around.
''England is a very easy place to adapt to. Obviously there's the language.
But you also know the supermarkets and the way of life."
Butler likes Chester and feels that her time on the job has given her invaluable training. ''It was very good that I got 
the opportunity to come over here. The experience has been brilliant. And when you don't have ties and you're just 
here to work, you can work late.
''The only bad thing is when something goes wrong. I've been sick over here once or twice and had to get a doctor 
and it's difficult to do that, or maybe I just wasn't going about it the right way. It's when things go wrong that you 
miss friends and family and feel you're on your own."
At the height of the project, more than a dozen Irish people were travelling across the Irish Sea every week. They 
would share lifts to and from the airports on both sides.
Now, as the project winds down, it is just Butler and her manager. Organisation is the key to making the weekly 
commute work, Butler says.
Booking flights well in advance means avoiding higher travel costs. Now that the Wrexham contract is finished, she 
will be commuting from Dublin to Carlow, where the firm is overseeing another pharmaceutical plant construction.
The weekly commute is suited to the young professional, particularly those in the construction industry, who have 
seen work fall away in Ireland during the downturn.
They benefit from having no break in their career CV, and gain the skills and experience of large contract work 
without having to relocate their family and home to another country.
Red-eye rovers
Annette Hiney, an associate with an engineering consultancy, has been flying weekly to London since last October. 
''I was seconded to a construction project in London. At first it was two to three days a week, but then it became 
five."
She and fellow commuter workers dubbed one London hotel 'Guantanamo'. ''It was soulless, with a constant 
chemical smell. It was like living in a cell."
Though she has found a better hotel, she is still living out of a suitcase and hoping to sign off on an apartment soon. 
''That will be just bliss. When you're eating out for breakfast, dinner and tea, you long for home-cooked food." And 
are there any joys in living in a world capital on weekdays?
''We do go out, maybe to the Albert Hall or catch a show and tryout different restaurants." But time off is brief. There 
are plenty of long working days to make up for arriving at her desk at 10.30am on a Monday and leaving mid-
afternoon on a Friday.
She sees plenty of other suited workers on her early Monday flights to London. ''They have it timed to the second. 
They have their coffee, their Danish, their hand luggage. It's like clockwork.
And they have everything worked out, from taking the battery out of the laptop for the security check and the right 
pair of shoes. They check in online, get on the plane and fall asleep."
The recent travel disruption of the ash cloud has brought it home to Hiney and other cross-country commuters how 
reliant they have become on planes. A ten to 12-hour ferry and train or road journey would not be a feasible way to 
get over and back every week.
A spokeswoman for the Dublin Airport Authority says the authority has no detailed figures on the increase in 
business passengers on these Monday and Friday flights.
''That slot of 6am to 7.30am in the morning is absolutely the busiest time of the day and, yes, you would have an 
increase in business people."
A spokesman for Ryanair says the airline has cut flights to London, and blames the  10 tourist tax for a fall in tourist 
numbers. ''The remaining flights, especially those on Monday mornings and Friday evenings, continue to perform 
well with very high load factors. These flights are now primarily populated with business travellers," he says.
Not only do these workers have to negotiate airport security, they also have to deal with tax laws surrounding cross-
border work. In broad terms, if you are living and working in another tax jurisdiction, you pay tax in that jurisdiction 
and are exempted from Irish taxation.
But the definitions of residency are many and varied.
''The tax situation is complex and depends on each individual's unique circumstances," says tax accountant John 
Carlin. ''It revolves around the residency of the person involved. The Revenue has granted reliefs to people who 
work outside the jurisdiction. But the reliefs are specific to your own circumstances.
For anybody to establish what relief they're entitled to, they need to visit the Revenue website. There's a very clear 
document called 'Going to work abroad' or, alternatively, you can contact a chartered accountant."
The tax situation gets more complicated when the person working abroad has other income, like rental income 
generated in Ireland, or their spouse is working and paying tax in Ireland.
As the red-eye Monday morning flights fill up with business people going to work in Britain, air miles are clocked up 
and familiar tired faces nod to each other. It may not be ideal, but it's an alternative to the dole queue or emigration, 
and many hope that it is a temporary solution to the downturn.

A dilemma troubles me, which never even occurred to me until last weekend - when, and to what extent, is it 
appropriate for a man to stare at scantily-clad women in public?
Before you answer ''never'', consider advertising, which routinely uses near-naked women to sell everything from 
cars to crisps. Consider rock 'n' roll, the entire history of which could be summarised as one great big musical lech.
The artistic nude from the Renaissance onwards - has that been all leching, or is it art?
Every so often, the Better Half drags me to black tie events, which she regularly attends as part of her work.
She sometimes gets leched at, and when she tires of this, demands my presence, thinking that a six-foot-four slab 
of grumpy, overweight male should put other men off. Usually, she thinks right. So I find myself with 900 other 
formally-attired people arrayed around the biggest marquee I've ever seen.
A marquee this size could double as a terminal for Dublin airport, or you could have given it to Ryanair to fix their 
planes, or to Michael O'Leary to keep his money in. Well, maybe not quite that, but it was big.
Before being seated, a fair amount of free drink had been poured into us, and the food was a bit behind, so another 
fair amount of drink was consumed while waiting.
Then something quite unusual happened: about a dozen fabulous young women trooped out and performed the 
most amazing belly dance routine I've ever seen.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not a connoisseur of belly dancing, and I would rather hammer rusty nails into my eyeballs 
than attend a lap dancing or strip club which, tome, are just plain wrong. But you see, herein lies the rub, because I 
know other men who would argue that lap-dancing clubs are just a bit of harmless leching. To me, they're 
embarrassing, and if you need proof of that, just look at the state of Peter Stringfellow.
Dissent of Man
I half-turned my chair to watch the belly dancers, provoking great mirth from the women at the table.
Then I realised, all their men were older than me, and these chaps were staring into their wine glasses as if the 
belly dancers didn't exist.
To me, there was nothing rude about what these fine young ladies were doing - they were just waggling their bums 
and showing their bellies, in perfectly choreographed unison.
And this was, after all, a very respectable charity bash in socially conservative south Belfast, not some seedy dive 
in Amsterdam's red light district. But the older men didn't dare look. I caught a few of them peeking, but none of 
them turned their heads, let alone their chairs.
So there I was, amusingly labelled a lech for the rest of the evening.
To general hilarity, someone even fetched a belly dancer over, to take a photo of her beside me. I was careful to 
hold her by her fingertips. As I resumed my seat, I wondered whether this was an age thing.
Does the older generation view belly dancing with the same distaste as I view Peter Stringfellow?
And does the younger generation see women's bellies and waggled (but covered) bums as yawnsomely lame? My 
granny used to turn the TV off when Dolly Parton came on, not because of her singing, but because of the size of 
her chest.
Although she did love the wrestling, in which huge, near-naked men hugged one another until they howled. But that 
wasn't leching, that was sport.

British budget airline easyJet carried 7.9 percent more passengers in May year-on-year - compared to Ryanair 17pc 
rise - despite disruption caused by volcanic dust.
It also said it would trial an infrared ash detector to limit future stoppages.
EasyJet flew 4.26 million passengers in May, up from 3.95 million the year before, while its load factor - a measure 
of how well it fills planes - rose 2.3 percentage points to 83.5 percent as traffic across the continent recovers.
Shares in easyJet, which have risen a fifth in 2010, were up 0.8 percent at 427.5 pence by 0848 GMT, valuing the 
carrier at around 1.83 billion pounds (dollar 2.7 billion). The spread of ash from an erupting volcano in Iceland 
grounded much of European air traffic for nearly a week in April over fears of the effect ash could have on jet 
engines. There were far fewer closures last month as the cloud dissipated and regulators eased flying restrictions. 
EasyJet also said it would try out a new ash detector in the coming months in a bid to end ash-related disruption. 
The Airborne Volcanic Object Identifier and Detector (AVOID), designed by Norway's Institute for Air Research, 
uses an infrared radar system which is placed onto an aircraft to supply images to pilots and flight control centres. 
These images will allow pilots to see an ash cloud up to 100 km (60 miles) ahead of the aircraft and at altitudes 
between 5,000 and 50,000 feet, easyJet said. "The ash detector will enable our aircraft to see and avoid the ash 
cloud, just like airborne weather radars and weather maps make thunderstorms visible," easyJet Chief Executive 
Andy Harrison said in a statement. Air France-KLM and Ryanair's May traffic rose 4.3 and 17 percent, respectively, 
and both said demand continued to improve.

The main Dublin shares index rose this morning as investors take up positions ahead of crucial US jobs data that 
will - it is hoped - give clear evidence that the world's biggest economy is firmly on the path to recovery.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had risen by 14.75 points to 3,049.48.
CRH did most to lift the index with its shares climbing 15c to E19.52. Cemex - one of CRH's main competitors on 
the global stage - cut its full year EBITDA guidance from dollar 2.9bn to dollar 2.75bn due to the weak performance 
of the euro and the Mexican peso against the US dollar. Underlying guidance in terms of volumes remains 
unchanged. The group still expects full year cement volumes to rise by around 3pc, ready-mix volumes to decline 
slightly and aggregates volumes to increase by about 1pc. Importantly for CRH, the group still expects high-single-
digit growth in cement volumes in the US.
Ireland's biggest food firm, Kerry Group, saw its shares fall 16c to E22.84. Davy's 2010 earnings per share (EPS) 
forecast (+10.7pc) assumes that Kerry will return to double-digit earnings growth for the first time since 2002. "While 
the headline EPS growth rate is important, it fails to capture the full story - a business generating improving returns 
on capital, resulting in a better-quality earnings stream," analyst, Cathal Kenny, said. Kerry has consistently 
generated returns on invested capital over its weighted average cost of capital. Since 2005, the average 
ROIC/WACC spread has averaged 6pc. Returns on invested capital (ROIC) and returns on capital employed 
(ROCE) have both increased by 160bps since 2005. Despite the acceleration in returns on invested capital, the 
underlying P/E (price to earnings) rating has not reflected this - the average P/E in 2005 was 14.5x versus the 
current rating of 12.1x. In 2005, adjusted EPS grew by 7pc versus our current FY2010 forecast of 10.7pc. On an 
EV/IC basis, the stock trades on 1.7x in 2010 versus 1.8x in 2005, the broker said. As expected, Ryanair has

British Airways cabin crew's latest strike will go ahead on Saturday and there are no talks planned between the 
airline and unions to avert the five-day stoppage, the Unite union said.
"There are no talks planned and the strike goes ahead tomorrow (Saturday)," a Unite spokeswoman said on Friday.
BA said it was "still available for talks" and that conciliation service ACAS was "talking to both parties to try and 
arrange talks".
The strikes stem from BA's decision last November to cut cabin crew pay and alter staffing levels to save 62.5 
million pounds (dollar 91.5 million) a year to counter falling demand, volatile fuel prices and greater competition. 
The latest strike comes less than a week before the start of the soccer World Cup in South Africa and follows a five-
day strike which ended on Thursday. This follows on from a four-day walkout last week and seven days of 
stoppages in March. BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh and leaders of labour union Unite, which represents cabin 
crew, blame each other for a breakdown in communication. Six months' worth of talks have failed to yield a 
resolution, with the walkouts having caused BA to ground flights on 17 occasions so far. The issue of travel 
allowances for cabin crew has become a major sticking point in the conflict, which comes at a difficult time for BA. 
Last month, the airline announced a full-year loss of 531 million pounds. BA, Europe's third-largest airline, which is 
losing around 7 million pounds a day from the strike, said the total cost of the stoppages could only be assessed at 
the end of the disruption and would reflect lost bookings offset by some volume driven cost savings. BA carried 11.5 
percent fewer passenger in May year-on-year because of the strikes, leaving it lagging rivals such as Air France-
KLM, Ryanair and easyJet whose passenger numbers are rising. (C ) Reuters

the end of the disruption and would reflect lost bookings offset by some volume driven cost savings. BA carried 11.5

Body
British Airways cabin crew's latest strike will go ahead on Saturday and there are no talks planned between the 
airline and unions to avert the five-day stoppage, the Unite union said.
"There are no talks planned and the strike goes ahead tomorrow (Saturday)," a Unite spokeswoman said on Friday.
BA said it was "still available for talks" and that conciliation service ACAS was "talking to both parties to try and 
arrange talks".
The strikes stem from BA's decision last November to cut cabin crew pay and alter staffing levels to save 62.5 
million pounds (dollar 91.5 million) a year to counter falling demand, volatile fuel prices and greater competition. 
The latest strike comes less than a week before the start of the soccer World Cup in South Africa and follows a five-
day strike which ended on Thursday. This follows on from a four-day walkout last week and seven days of 
stoppages in March. BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh and leaders of labour union Unite, which represents cabin 
crew, blame each other for a breakdown in communication. Six months' worth of talks have failed to yield a 
resolution, with the walkouts having caused BA to ground flights on 17 occasions so far. The issue of travel 
allowances for cabin crew has become a major sticking point in the conflict, which comes at a difficult time for BA.

Body
The price of the cabin crew strikes at British Airways was laid bare yesterday as the airline revealed that last 
month's walkouts have been costing it £7m a day and saw passenger numbers tumble sharply.
On a day when BA's rivals, Air France-KLM and Ryanair, reported a jump in passenger numbers in line with 
improving economic conditions, the UK airline's overall numbers fell 14 per cent in May compared with the same 
month a year ago.
The size of the daily losses is higher than the £5.5m BA last reported it was losing each day during an earlier round 
of flight attendant strikes in March, when it was running fewer flights because of the winter season. The airline's 
load factors - a measure of how full its aircraft are - also fell more than five points to just under 70 per cent.
However, a number of investors contacted by the Financial Times yesterday remained broadly sanguine about the 
long-term effect of the stoppages, which are due to last at least another five days from Saturday and may continue 
through the summer.
Regulatory disclosures show some leading BA investors, such as Aegon Asset Management, have increased their 
holdings in the airline over the past week, when thousands of cabin crew were in the middle of their latest three five-
day walkouts.
This was because BA's underlying performance remained strong, Stephen Adams, Aegon's head of UK equities, 
said. "We wouldn't be adding to our shareholding if we didn't believe in the management and the long-term future of 
the company," he said.
Other investors without a stake in the company said even the prospect of strikes lasting through the busiest 
summer months would be bearable as long as it brought about a permanent reduction in staff costs.
"BA really doesn't have a choice," Paul Owens, a member of the fixed-income team at the Liontrust investment 
management group, said. "They have extremely high labour costs and they have to address those costs." Mr 
BA losses fail to put off investors
Owens said the risks for Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, were high. "But I think he will win and I think he will serve 
as a model for other managers."
Mr Walsh and leaders of the Unite union that represents BA's 13,400 cabin crew have held a series of talks to try to 
resolve the row over the last two weeks, but both sides said no fresh talks had been scheduled.
BA recently reported a £531m pre-tax loss, its worst annual deficit since it was privatised in 1987.

Dividends are in the news. On Wednesday two Democratic senators told BP it shouldn't pay a dividend until the 
total cost of the oil spill clean-up is estimated. Earlier, European airline Ryanair announced a first-ever cash 
payment to shareholders. Global coffee shop chain Starbucks also paid an inaugural dividend last month. Few 
things in finance, however, are as misunderstood and debated as dividends.
For all the hoo-ha about Starbucks, or Dow Chemical's first dividend cut since 1912 last year, investors should 
recall the classic 1958 paper by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, which argued that a company's dividend 
policy was irrelevant. There were many assumptions, of course, but simplistically shareholders should be indifferent 
between a dividend and a stronger share price due to higher free cash flows.
If dividends are irrelevant, should investors just ignore the finger pointing at BP or Ryanair's first cheque? The issue 
at BP is that there is a chance (admittedly small for now) that future claims on the company will exceed its ability to 
pay them. Whereas BP has unlimited liabilities, individual shareholders risk only their stock falling to zero. The 
asymmetric risk of paying a dividend, therefore, might be seen to be what lawyers call fraudulent transfer. If BP 
wants to maintain pay-outs, it must argue there is almost zero risk of default.
Debut-dividends at the likes of Starbucks are more difficult to interpret. Again, the theory shrugs. But Modigliani and 
Miller's model assumes operating cash flows are independent of dividend policy. Some believe, however, that 
higher pay-out ratios signal that management is short of profitable investment opportunities. Other studies show 
rising dividends to be bullish. Investors are best advised to ignore the debate and concentrate on a company's free 
cash flows instead.

Irish shares have extended their rally into a fifth day, with the ISEQ index up more than 1pc this morning.
The gains in Dublin reflect an upward trend on global markets as investors look forward to this evening's payroll

The expectation is for an upbeat figure, confirming that the recovery is taking a firmer hold in the world's largest 
economy.
The Irish index was up 35.82 points a short time ago at 3,0709.55. The main industrials were putting in a firm 
showing. CRH was up 12c to 1919, with Kerry Group ahead by 14c to 2314 and Smurfit Kappa up 20c to 670. 
Ryanair had lifted by 6c to 369 and Elan by 12c to 475.

The main Dublin shares index surged past the 3,000 level this morning amid renewed optimism that growth global 
economy will pick up after strong U.S. data overnight.
By 10:15, the ISEQ had risen by 58.07 points to 3,049.93.
Investor sentiment was also lifted after the Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index showed the 
services sector was expanding in May and the Final Services Employment Index showed its first jobs growth since 
June 2008 and, in Ireland, the NCB Purchasing Managers' Index, out this morning, rose to 52.4 from 51.0 in April, 
when it broke through the 50 barrier separating growth from contraction for the first time in 27 months.
In Britain, Kingfisher released its first quarter trading update this morning covering the thirteen weeks to May 1. 
Group sales of £2,642m were broadly in line with expectations, while sales of higher margin goods and strong focus 
on operational efficiencies resulted in retail profit growth of 12pc. From a divisional perspective, B and Q UK & 
Ireland reported like for like sales decline of 2.8pc for the quarter (versus -3.8pc in Q409 and +5.7pc in Q309). 
Screwfix reported relatively more resilient sales trends; total sales declined 0.8pc for the period (versus -1.4pc in 
Q409 and -3.8pc in Q309). Shares in Grafton, which has DIY and building supply retail chains in the UK, climbed 9c

News In Brief
## Exploration group Petroceltic will raise 21m euro from two new investors to develop its oil interests off the Italian 
coast. The Irish company says Canadian player Orca and equity investor Gemini Oil and Gas will pay a total of 
21.2m euro for a share of Petroceltic's planned Elsa-2 well off Italy's Adriatic coast. Petroceltic is selling 15 per cent 
of Elsa-2 to Orca, which has agreed to pay 30 per cent of the development costs, up to a maximum of USD 11.52m. 
Gemini has agreed to contribute USD 14m towards the development costs of Elsa-2, with the final USD 4m payable 
on testing of oil flows from the well. In return, Gemini will receive a share of revenues from oil and gas from the Elsa 
field. - Irish Times
## Brussels has approved a one-month extension to the second guarantee scheme but the government is still 
looking to have it pushed out to the end of the year as banks face refinancing a multi-billion euro wall of bonds 
falling due in September. It comes as the Irish banks continue to stand off from tapping the bond markets as the 
eurozone debt crisis has pushed the interest rate premiums of bank bonds over government debt. The second 
guarantee scheme -- or Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG), launched in January, which allows banks to issue 
bonds of up to five years in duration -- had been due to end on Monday. The banks and building societies have so 
far raised E 18bn under the ELG. The European Commission has now allowed Ireland to extend the ELG by a

Latvia and Poland. - Irish Independent

Ryanair may be known for penny-pinching flights, but now it is giving something back. After 13 years as a public 
company, Europe's biggest low-cost airline will pay investors a dividend . The EUR0.34 payment per share comes 
as the airline tripled its annual profits to EUR305m as the world around it fell apart. Indeed, industrial action at 
British Airways and economic uncertainty have only helped its bottom line.
It is not all good news, though. Income from ancillary services, the lifeblood of the airline, looks shaky. These 
sometimes sneaky extra charges for baggage and check-in services handed the airline EUR664m last year. But 
after five straight years of boosting the amount paid per passenger, this year it dropped to less than EUR10 per 
person. At the same time, growth in passenger numbers declined for the fifth straight year.
Investors may wonder whether a dividend signals the company has relinquished its status as a growth stock. This 
seems unlikely for now. The trend away from business class travel for short-haul flights across Europe should be 
maintained by continued economic turbulence in the region. Furthermore, new aircraft on order will allow it to carry 
85m passengers within three years. This would give it a market share of about 15 per cent - still below the 18 per 
cent of the US market held by Southwest, whose business model inspired Ryanair.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, insists the dividend, along with plans for another EUR500m return to shareholders 
before 2013, is a one-off. But although there is still room to grow, the sheer volume of cash generated by the 
business means it is perhaps only a matter of time before the Scrooge-like airline becomes more giving with its 
dividends.

Ryanair yesterday revealed plans to pay its first dividend since it was floated more than a decade ago in a move 
that will enrich Michael O'Leary, its outspoken chief executive, by nearly EUR20m (£17m).
The Dublin-based budget airline announced the payment as it reported it had swung from a record loss a year ago 
to one of the largest profits any European airline has made during the economic downturn.
Shares in Ryanair closed up 7 per cent at EUR3.53 yesterday after Mr O'Leary, who owns more than 4 per cent of 
the airline and repeated that he had no plans to retire before 2012, forecast another rise in profits this year.
He has suggested the company might start returning cash to shareholders by 2012 or 2013 after talks to buy 200 
new aircraft from Boeing broke down.
Although some had interpreted his comments as a negotiating ploy with the US aircraft manufacturer, he said the 
airline now proposed to return EUR500m to shareholders, or 34 cents a share, in the form of a one-off dividend in 
October.
Another EUR500m could be returned to shareholders by the end of the 2013 financial year, either in a new dividend 
or share buy-backs.
"Most people thought it would never happen," he said, adding Ryanair's strategy had the "great upside" of driving 
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of rival low-cost airline EasyJet, "absolutely bloody nuts".
Sir Stelios, EasyJet's largest shareholder, has been fighting the airline's management over their expansion plans 
and reluctance to pay a dividend quickly.
Sir Stelios said he was glad to see Mr O'Leary proposing a dividend, adding: "I hope Carolyn McCall [incoming 
EasyJet chief executive] and Mike Rake [chairman] are watching this closely."
Ryanair set to pay first dividend since flotation
In contrast to full-service flag carriers such as British Airways or Air France-KLM, which have both reported large 
losses, under IFRS accounting standards Ryanair made a pre-tax profit of EUR341m in the 12 months to the end of 
March. Revenues rose 2 per cent to EUR2.9bn, and passenger numbers rose 14 per cent to 66.5m. Earnings per 
share rose from 7.1 cents to 21.59 cents.
Last year, Ryanair made a pre-tax loss of EUR180.5m, its first loss since it floated in 1997, after it took a 
EUR222.5m write-off on the value of its stake in Irish rival, Aer Lingus, whose share price plunged after Ryanair 
made a failed takeover bid for it.
"This is a robust set of numbers in a difficult market," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, who said the 
main reason was Ryanair's ability to "keep their unit costs at industry lows".

Budget airline Ryanair said Tuesday that it earned a full-year profit of (EURO)305.3 million ($375.7 million), 
reversing a loss a year earlier when it took a massive write-off from its failed attempt to take over rival carrier Aer 
Lingus.
Europe's biggest budget airline said Tuesday that passenger numbers rose 14 percent to 58.6 million in the year 
ending March 31. Revenue, however, was up just 2 percent to (EURO)3 billion.
A year ago, Ryanair posted a loss of (EURO)169.2 million as it wrote off (EURO)222.5 million on its 30 percent 
stake in Aer Lingus, the former national airline which was privatized in 2006. Ryanair took a further impairment 
charge of (EURO)13.5 million on its stake in Aer Lingus reflecting a further drop in that airline's share price.
The company announced a one-off dividend of (EURO)0.34 per share.
Ryanair shares were up 5.3 percent to (EURO)3.46 in early trading on the London Stock Exchange.
The company turned an operating profit excluding exceptional items of (EURO)402 million, compared to 
(EURO)144.2 million a year earlier.
Fuel costs fell from (EURO)1.26 billion to (EURO)894 million.
In the current year, Ryanair said it expected traffic to grow by 11 percent and profits to rise by 10-15 percent despite 
fuel costs increasing by (EURO)300 million.

European budget airline Ryanair announced a return to robust full-year profits Tuesday and unveiled its first-ever 
cash dividend to shareholders, underlining its ability to fight the headwinds of recession.
The Dublin-based carrier said it recorded a net profit of (EURO)305.3 million ($375.7 million) for the 12 months 
ending March 31. That reversed last year's net loss of (EURO)169.2 million, when Ryanair suffered an exceptional 
(EURO)222.5 million writeoff on its 30 percent stake in its struggling Irish rival, Aer Lingus.
And Ryanair underscored its exceptionally strong cash reserves by announcing its first dividend since becoming a 
publicly listed company in 1997.
Ryanair said it would pay shareholders about (EURO)500 million, or (EURO)0.34 per share, in October and 
envisioned a similar payment by 2013.
Ryanair shares rose 4.4 percent to close at (EURO)3.52 on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Chief financial officer Howard Millar said the airline was paying a dividend because of Ryanair's previously 
announced shelving of plans to negotiate a new 200-plane order with Boeing, its sole supplier of aircraft. He said 
this would mean much lower capital spending for the next three years.
The airline said its cash reserves already have risen by (EURO)535 million over the past year to (EURO)2.8 billion. 
Millar said the postponement of new aircraft orders could fuel an additional (EURO)1 billion in savings through 
2013.
Ryanair said its passenger numbers rose 14 percent to 66.5 million, but its income rose just 2 percent to 
(EURO)2.99 billion, reflecting its hefty discounting of airfares to keep its planes full.
The airline also recorded another exceptional writeoff of (EURO)13.5 million because of continued falls in the share 
value of Aer Lingus, the formerly state-owned airline that Ryanair has been trying to acquire since 2006. The Irish 
government, which remains Aer Lingus' second-largest shareholder, opposes a Ryanair takeover on competition 
grounds.
Ryanair soars back into profit, pays 1st dividend
Ryanair turned an operating profit excluding exceptional items of (EURO)402 million, compared to (EURO)144.2 
million a year earlier, in part because its fuel costs fell 29 percent to (EURO)894 million.
In the current year, Ryanair said it expected traffic to grow 11 percent and profits to rise more than 10 percent, even 
though it expects fuel costs to rise about (EURO)300 million.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair also expected to lose (EURO)50 million from extensive flight 
disruptions caused by volcanic ash eruptions in Iceland. The threat forced European air safety officials to cancel 
9,400 Ryanair flights, stranding 1.5 million customers in April and May. Many are seeking compensation for their 
hotel and meal bills from Ryanair.
O'Leary said Ryanair planned to sue the European Commission in hopes of overturning EU rules that make airlines 
not travel insurance companies or authorities liable to pay customers' bills when their return flights are grounded for 
days by ash threats. He said the lawsuit would focus on "the 20 most ludicrous claims" received by Ryanair in 
recent weeks.
"We're happy to compensate when it is our screw-up," O'Leary said. "But when it's an act of God, we don't think the 
airlines should have to pay out."
Unlike the recession-battered airline industry as a whole, Ryanair keeps growing.
The airline said its fleet has grown to 232 over the past year with the delivery of 51 more Boeing 737-800s from 
previous orders. It opened 284 new routes and eight new European bases to reach 940 routes and 42 bases.

The Dublin shares market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon as a slowdown in global manufacturing 
added to doubts about the pace of an economic recovery but US data proved stronger than expected.
Investors also worried about over the euro zone sovereign debt crisis after Spain's credit rating was downgraded by 
Fitch last week. Adding to concerns, the European Central Bank said banks in the region face another dollar 239 
billion in potential writedowns. A survey showed manufacturing activity in the euro zone expanded in May at a 
considerably more sluggish pace than in April, while separate data indicated the pace of China's factory output 
eased last month. Meanwhile, influential economist Nouriel Roubini said advanced economies face years of 
anaemic growth and the risk of a double-dip recession as they cope with a weak labour market and high debt.
Once again, banks put in a weak performance with AIB down 2c to E1.01, Bank of Ireland dropped 1c to E0.71 and

Ryanair released its 2010 results, reporting net profit (pre-exceptionals) of E319m for the year compared to 
Goodbody's E331m estimate. Post exceptionals, net income was E305m, compared with the broker's E317m 
estimate and E311m consensus. Ryanair carried 66.5m passengers in 2010 (up 13.5pc) with an 82pc load factor. 
Scheduled revenues fell 0.8pc to E2,325m, versus Goodbody's estimate of E2,323m. Ancillaries rose 11pc to 
E664m compared to an E638m forecast. Operating costs ex-fuel were up 10pc to E1,692m, while the broker had

Depreciation (+15pc), Rentals (+22pc) and Staff (+8pc). A smaller number on the profit and loss sheet, 
maintenance was also up 29pc. Fuel costs fell 29pc to E894m compared to its E878m estimate (-30pc). Yields fell

Irish airline Ryanair plans to pay its first dividend since being floated in 1997.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said this morning that it proposes to pay 500m euro in a one-off dividend in 
October of this year possibly another 500m euro later as a dividend or share buyback.
He said the money would represent a distribution of up to 1bn euros of surplus cash that the carrier will generate by 
the end of 2013.
The airline announced this morning that it had swung back to a full-year profit ahead of most rivals and expects to 
grow earnings further this year. Ryanair has not paid dividends in the past, but it has spent more than 300 million 
euros on share buybacks in the past three years. The low costs carrier last year posted its first loss in 20 years after 
writing down the value of its stake in former takeover target Aer Lingus. This morning it has posted an adjusted net 
profit of 319m euros for the year to the end of March, before writing down another 13.5m euro for Aer Lingus. That 
compares with analysts expectation for a net profit of 311.74 m euros and Ryanair's own projection in April for at 
least 310 m euros in net profit. It expects profit in the coming year to rise by between 10 and 15 pc excluding 
exceptional costs from disruptions caused by a volcanic ash cloud which drifted over European airspace from 
Iceland. The issue of its first ever dividend comes after the ending of talks with Boeing about the purchase of an 
expanded fleet of aircraft. "Since we don't anticipate a new deal with Boeing for the foreseeable future, our gross 
capex (investment) will fall substantially over the next three years," O'Leary said this morning.

The Dublin shares market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon as a slowdown in global manufacturing 
added to doubts about the pace of an economic recovery but US data proved stronger than expected.
Investors also worried about over the euro zone sovereign debt crisis after Spain's credit rating was downgraded by 
Fitch last week. Adding to concerns, the European Central Bank said banks in the region face another dollar 239 
billion in potential writedowns. A survey showed manufacturing activity in the euro zone expanded in May at a 
considerably more sluggish pace than in April, while separate data indicated the pace of China's factory output 
eased last month. Meanwhile, influential economist Nouriel Roubini said advanced economies face years of 
anaemic growth and the risk of a double-dip recession as they cope with a weak labour market and high debt.

Ryanair released its 2010 results, reporting net profit (pre-exceptionals) of E319m for the year compared to 
Goodbody's E331m estimate. Post exceptionals, net income was E305m, compared with the broker's E317m 
estimate and E311m consensus. Ryanair carried 66.5m passengers in 2010 (up 13.5pc) with an 82pc load factor.

Bicheno-Brown does battle...
A painting by Flightglobal editorial artist Tim Bicheno-Brown depicting the Battle of Britain is to be exhibited at the 
prestigious Guild of Aviation Artists 40th annual "Aviation painting of the year" exhibition.
The acrylic on canvas painting, titled " Up for the fight", depicts a bystander witnessing dogfights playing out high 
above. Admission to the exhibition, which runs from 19-25 July at the Mall galleries in London, is free. More details 
at www.gava.org.uk
...while Picarella goes Japanese
On the subject of Flightglobal illustrators, senior technical artist Giuseppe Picarella has produced an in-depth 
volume on one of Japan's key Second World War fighters, the Kawasaki Ki-100.
Published in Japan and available through specialist outlets, this well-illustrated book (ISBN978-4-499-23004-9) 
which is No 32 in the Aero Detail series, contains over 200 photographs and many detailed drawings. Written in 
Japanese and English, it examines the only Ki-100 in existence. This aircraft is preserved at the RAF Museum in 
Hendon, London and Picarella - a respected authority on Japanese aviation - has been extensively involved in its 
restoration.
All aboard the Airbus ark?
A new Airbus ACJ appeared at the recent EBACE show in Geneva carrying the registration G-NOAH, prompting 
one witty hack to ask: "I suppose the cabin layout is two by two?"
A meal of it
As Airbus and Boeing battle with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or "OECD", over 
revisions to aircraft finance structures to include Canada and Brazil, one weary executive jokes that a more 
appropriate description would be the "organisation for extended conversation over dinner".

Pack it in
Not content with the nerve-jangling trumpet blast every time it completes an on-time landing, Ryanair is inflicting 
another irritating pre-recorded announcement on long-suffering passengers. The blurb for its in-flight drinks service 
tempts imbibers to reward themselves after their journey to check in, involving the hike from distant car park lugging 
"luggage for four". No mention of the fact that anyone turning up at Ryanair with "luggage for four" is likely to be 
sent packing.

(RTTNews) - The European markets rebounded from early losses to close higher on Tuesday, as upbeat U.S. 
economic data lifted investor sentiment even though BP shares fell sharply.
The U.S. Commerce Department said in a report that construction spending surged up by 2.7% to an annual rate of 
$869.1 billion in April from the revised March estimate of $845.9 billion. Economists had expected a much more 
modest increase in spending of about 0.1%.
The Institute for Supply Management in the U.S. said its index of activity in the manufacturing sector edged down to 
59.7 in May from 60.4 in April, but a reading above 50 indicates continued growth in the sector. Economists had 
expected the index to slip to a reading of 59.4.
Earlier in the day, investor confidence was shaken a bit after reports showed that the rate of manufacturing 
expansion in China and Europe slowed. Markit Economics also said its final Purchasing Managers' Index for the 
euro region stood at a 3-month low of 55.8 in May, down from the flash estimate of 55.9.
The HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers' index for China stood at a seasonally adjusted 52.7 in May, down 
from a revised figure of 55.2 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while one below suggests 
contraction.
Crude for July delivery fell $0.59 to $73.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, by the time the 
European markets closed.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of pan-European blue chips closed 0.17% higher at 1,002.80 points. Around Europe, 
Germany's DAX index rose 0.28% to 5,981.27, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index slipped 0.56% to 5,159.33 and 
France's CAC 40 index fell 0.13% to 3,503.08.
Prudential, Britain's largest insurer, surged up 6.3% after American International Group said it would not consider 
revising the terms of a deal for its Asian life insurance unit with Prudential, raising speculation that the deal would 
collapse.
Ryanair, Europe's largest discount carrier, climbed 4.4% after the company reported a swing to full year profit and 
said it will pay its first dividend.

On the other hand, BP, Europe's biggest oil company, tumbled 13.1% on the first day of trading in London after the 
company's "top kill" effort to plug a massive oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico failed. U.K. markets were closed 
yesterday for a holiday. BP said Tuesday that the cost of the response to date amounted to about $990 million, 
including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid and 
federal costs.

Slowing momentum in China's economic growth, fears of bad loans held by eurozone banks and BP's failure to 
stem the worsening oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continue to depress UK markets.
On the domestic economic front news that British manufacturing activity had held steady in May at the previous 
month's 15-year high was overshadowed by signs of accelerating price pressures.
By 10am the FTSE 100 index was down 111 points to 5,077, over half the fall attributed to BP's 65p plunge to 430p 
on its oil spill disaster.
The Mid-250 index was 185 points weaker at 9,452,
Apart from the BP disaster, oil shares were generally easier as the crude price suffered from slackening economic 
growth in China.
Royal Dutch Shell lost 46p to £17.77 and Cairn Energy 10p to 392.5p.
Break-up bid speculation continued to spur Prudential, 26p higher at 567.5p, as its AIA deal nears collapse.
Defensive issues attracted selective support against the renewed uncertain investment backdrop, with Scottish & 
Southern Energy at £10.69 and Imperial Tobacco £10.04, up 17p and 4p.
Favourable press comment sustained Experian at 622.5p, up 4p.
Travel shares succumbed to profit-taking after recent strength, with TUI Travel down 9p to 228p.
Mining shares remained depressed by slowing Chinese economic growth with Kazakhmys at £11.40, BHP Billiton, 
£18.57 and Lonmin £16.35 all around three per cent easier.
Dull banks had Barclays 7p lower at 298.5p on revived eurozone bad debt concerns.
Among the mid-caps Intermediate Capital hardened 3p to 263p, helped by a positive note from Collins Stewart and 
Partygaming rallied 7p to 267p.
Elsewhere Genus was a good market at 712p, up 11p, but Carpetright lacked support at 681.5p,down 37.5p.
BP's share plunge accounts for half of FTSE fall
Chemring tumbled 101p to £30.71 as it abandoned its bid for Allied Defence Corp due to an ongoing corruption 
investigation into a former employee of one of the firm's units.
Northern Foods held steady at 47.75p, down 0.25p, after flat profits and Ryanair edged up 2.19% to 3.52 as it 
planned to pay its first dividend since being floated in 1997.

Body
With both the FTSE and Wall Street on a holiday, the ISEQ made modest gains in line with its European peers as 
Spain's downgrade was shrugged off.
The ISEQ rose 8.92 points to 2,947.70.
European equities advanced, brushing off a downgrade to Spain's sovereign credit rating, though the region's 
stocks were headed for their worst monthly losses in 14 months on euro zone's debt problems. The FTSEurofirst 
300 index of leading European shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,000.66 points as trading was subdued with the UK 
and the U.S. markets closed for holiday. The pan-European index is down 5.8 percent this month, on track for its 
worst monthly percentage loss since February 2009. Fitch Ratings cut Spain's debt rating by one notch to AA-plus 
with a stable outlook after European markets closed on Friday, pulling Wall Street lower. The move by Fitch had 
largely been priced in by the markets, though Spain's Ibex 35 fell 0.7 percent, with Banco Santander down 0.8 
percent and BBVA falling 1.6 percent. Standard and Poor's downgraded Spain's ratings by one notch to AA with a 
negative outlook on April 28.
Banks were weak again with AIB down 1c to E1.03, Bank of Ireland fell 2c to E0.72 and Irish Life and Permanent 
edged up 2c to E1.95. Rossa White of Davy do not think that the second half outlook for Ireland has deteriorated, 
despite the recent turmoil in financial markets. "A weaker euro is a positive, albeit that the impact on the dollar cross 
is exaggerated (most Irish exports to the US are priced in dollars). We think that for the 'core' euro area economies 
it is a net positive: the competitive boost may more than offset further fiscal tightening. That will benefit Ireland 
indirectly. And, even though Ireland's government bond spreads have nudged higher further out the curve, the 
absolute level of yields is virtually unchanged thanks to the rally in German bunds. Bank funding is still the niggling 
concern." Ryanair shares gained 11c to E3.40. The airline reports full year results on Tuesday. Goodbody are 
forecasting adjusted earnings per share of 22.3 cent and net profit of E317m, after the carrier raised guidance on

April 1 from E275m to "no less than E310m". The broker expect revenues to rise 0.6pc to E2.3bn, as both a 7pc 
increase in ancillaries and a 13pc rise in passengers are offset by negative yields from Q1-Q3 (-13pc, -20pc and -
12pc in Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively). "We expect yields to reach an inflection point in Q4, turning positive with a 
2.7pc rise in the quarter, bringing the full year decline to 12.5pc for 2010." Positive news from the sector, improved 
booking profile management and a better route mix (with route expansion in Southern Europe) are yield enhancing 
and as such Goodbody are forecasting yields up 8pc in 2011 (up 2pc, 8pc, 12pc, and 11pc in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 
respectively). Disruption from the ash cloud could impact yields in 2011. The oil price has fallen nearly 30pc since 
the start of the year to USD 73 a barrel, having peaked at USD88.5 on May 3. Ryanair has hedged out 75pc of its 
2011 requirements at an average price of USD72, so the broker said he would look positively on any further 
hedging below its forecast of dollar 75 a barrel for the unhedged portion. Shares in the airline jumped 14c to E3.43.

With both the FTSE and Wall Street on a holiday, the ISEQ made modest gains in line with its European peers as 
Spain's downgrade was shrugged off.
The ISEQ rose 8.92 points to 2,947.70.
European equities advanced, brushing off a downgrade to Spain's sovereign credit rating, though the region's 
stocks were headed for their worst monthly losses in 14 months on euro zone's debt problems. The FTSEurofirst 
300 index of leading European shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,000.66 points as trading was subdued with the UK 
and the U.S. markets closed for holiday. The pan-European index is down 5.8 percent this month, on track for its 
worst monthly percentage loss since February 2009. Fitch Ratings cut Spain's debt rating by one notch to AA-plus 
with a stable outlook after European markets closed on Friday, pulling Wall Street lower. The move by Fitch had 
largely been priced in by the markets, though Spain's Ibex 35 fell 0.7 percent, with Banco Santander down 0.8 
percent and BBVA falling 1.6 percent. Standard and Poor's downgraded Spain's ratings by one notch to AA with a 
negative outlook on April 28.
Banks were weak again with AIB down 1c to E1.03, Bank of Ireland fell 2c to E0.72 and Irish Life and Permanent 
edged up 2c to E1.95. Rossa White of Davy do not think that the second half outlook for Ireland has deteriorated,

and as such Goodbody are forecasting yields up 8pc in 2011 (up 2pc, 8pc, 12pc, and 11pc in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 
respectively). Disruption from the ash cloud could impact yields in 2011. The oil price has fallen nearly 30pc since 
the start of the year to USD 73 a barrel, having peaked at USD88.5 on May 3. Ryanair has hedged out 75pc of its 
2011 requirements at an average price of USD72, so the broker said he would look positively on any further 
hedging below its forecast of dollar 75 a barrel for the unhedged portion. Shares in the airline jumped 14c to E3.43.

The Irish Government and its tourist tax and not the international economic situation is to blame for the collapse of 
Irish tourism, according to Ryanair today.
Ryanair said that new (independent) statistics show traffic growth has returned to those EU countries that do not 
impose tourist taxes.
"These statistics disprove Minister Dempsey's claims that the fall in traffic and tourism is 'an international 
phenomenon' and proves that Irish tourism is being devastated by the Govt's E10 tourist tax," the airline said.
The airline quotes the RDC Aviation report, which shows that Irish seat capacity (which drives passenger numbers) 
collapsed by over 140,000 in April and by over 700,000 so far in 2010. Seat capacity continues to decline in Ireland, 
the UK and France - the only European countries that continue to impose tourist taxes. By contrast, growth has 
returned to countries which have scrapped tourist taxes (Belgium and Holland) or reduced airport charges, in some 
cases to zero, (Spain) to stimulate tourism growth, Ryanair said. Ryanair warned that this downward trend at Irish 
airports will worsen throughout 2010 "as the DAA makes Ireland even more uncompetitive with a 40pc increase in 
the airport charges to pay for its E1.2bn T2 white elephant". Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "The RDC Aviation 
report shows that those countries, like Ireland, which impose tourist taxes continue to decline and disproves the 
Dept of Transport's claims that the continuing record collapse in traffic at Dublin Airport is 'an international 
phenomenon'. The Irish Govt's E10 tourist tax and high charges at the DAA Monopoly have made Dublin an 
uncompetitive, expensive destination. Growth has returned throughout Europe except in Ireland, the UK and France 
which are the only major European countries to tax tourists instead of welcoming them. Ireland's traffic and tourism 
decline will increase when charges at the DAA Monopoly rocket by over 40pc in October as the Dept of Transport 
rewards the DAA for its traffic decline and the E1.2bn white elephant, T2. Unfortunately 2010 will be even worse 
Ryanair blames Govt for tourism collapse Ryanair On Figs
than 2009 in terms of lost visitors, jobs and tourism revenues in Ireland. It is time to axe this stupid E10 tourist tax

Controversial former Minister for Finance and EU Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, has been appointed to the 
board of Ryanair as a non-executive director.
Declan McKeon, former Audit Partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers (Dublin) will join him in a board room whose 
numbers will rise from eight members to ten.
"I am delighted to welcome Charlie and Declan to the Board of Ryanair Holdings, where I believe their skill and 
experience will allow them to play a significant role in ensuring that Ryanair continues to grow safely and profitably, 
while lowering fares and improving our industry leading customer service," said Ryanair's Chairman, David 
Bonderman.
McCreevy got the green light from the EU Commission two weeks ago after he retired from his job as 
Commissioner back in February. His appointment comes as EU Authorities conduct several long-running state aid 
inquiries into some of the no-frills airline's contracts with European airports. However, the permission from the EU 
for him to take up the job stipulates that he will not be allowed advise Ryanair on any case involving its business 
which came before the EU executive's internal markets division during his time as commissioner, which began in 
late 2004. "He should refrain from giving advice on any live case on Ryanair during his five years," a commission 
spokesman said earlier this month. Mr McCreevy's light-touch policies on regulation of banks and the property 
market while he was in the Dail and in Brussels has been accused by some economists as being a factor in the 
near total collapse of the Irish banking system and the near bankruptcy of the Irish economy. He famously said a 
cornerstone of his economic thinking was "when I have money, I spend it, when I don't, I don't.

Controversial former Minister for Finance and EU Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, has been appointed to the 
board of Ryanair as a non-executive director.
Declan McKeon, former Audit Partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers (Dublin) will join him in a board room whose 
numbers will rise from eight members to ten.
"I am delighted to welcome Charlie and Declan to the Board of Ryanair Holdings, where I believe their skill and 
experience will allow them to play a significant role in ensuring that Ryanair continues to grow safely and profitably, 
while lowering fares and improving our industry leading customer service," said Ryanair's Chairman, David 
Bonderman.
McCreevy got the green light from the EU Commission two weeks ago after he retired from his job as 
Commissioner back in February. His appointment comes as EU Authorities conduct several long-running state aid 
inquiries into some of the no-frills airline's contracts with European airports. However, the permission from the EU 
for him to take up the job stipulates that he will not be allowed advise Ryanair on any case involving its business 
which came before the EU executive's internal markets division during his time as commissioner, which began in 
late 2004. "He should refrain from giving advice on any live case on Ryanair during his five years," a commission 
spokesman said earlier this month. Mr McCreevy's light-touch policies on regulation of banks and the property 
market while he was in the Dail and in Brussels has been accused by some economists as being a factor in the 
near total collapse of the Irish banking system and the near bankruptcy of the Irish economy. He famously said a 
cornerstone of his economic thinking was "when I have money, I spend it, when I don't, I don't.

Body
The main Dublin shares index closed another turbulent week on a downer as it tracked world markets, which 
continue to be hit hard by the eurozone's debt crisis.
The ISEQ fell 51.82 points to 2,938.78.
World equities teetered and the euro resumed its decline on Friday as lacklustre U.S. economic data and concern 
over further fallout from the euro zone's debt crisis led investors to temper bets. The mixed U.S. reports failed to 
inspire traders who were shielding themselves ahead of long holiday weekends in London and New York. U.S. 
indexes were nearly 1pc lower. Fears persisted over contagion from debt-laden Greece after a bounce in global 
equities earlier this week. Despite the lack of major shocks from Spain, Portugal or Ireland, which all have heavy 
debt loads, investors were loath to add risky assets due to questions over global recovery forecasts. The euro fell 
0.13pc to USD1.2352 Friday, is down 7pc for the month and on course for its sixth consecutive monthly loss.
Bank shares again failed to light up the board with AIB stocks up just 1c to E1.04, Bank of Ireland was down 3c to 
E0.74 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 10c at E1.94. According to the latest railroad data for the week 
ended May, carloads of US aggregates increased by 22pc annually. This continues the strong momentum in the 
series (+13pc and +20pc in the previous two weeks) and leaves the year to date figure at +3pc. If this positive 
development in the data continues it would point to something more than just a catch-up on the weather affected 
start to the year, according to Goodbodys. "Our forecasts assume low single-digit volume growth for CRH's US 
materials business (circa 48pc of group profits), which compares to guidance given by Martin Marietta and Vulcan 
Materials of 2-4pc and 0-5pc, respectively." CRH shares fell 77c to E18.23. In its trading update issued this 
morning, online gambler, 888 has guided that it "now expects profit to be significantly lower than previous market 
expectations" given weakness in online poker, regulation of the French market and the expectation that online 
gaming will be difficult during the World Cup. Management noted that it "has continued to experience a difficult 
ISEQ closes a tough week on a low ISEQ Falls
trading environment across its products", with the exception of Bingo. There has been particular weakness in online 
poker, a trend it considers has been industry wide, with average players declining by about 18pc between January 
and May. Shares in Paddy Power climbed 5c to E24.60. Ryanair shares gained 5c to E3.30. The airline reports full 
year results on Tuesday. Goodbody are forecasting adjusted earnings per share of 22.3 cent and net profit of 
E317m, after the carrier raised guidance on April 1 from E275m to "no less than E310m". The broker expect 
revenues to rise 0.6pc to E2.3bn, as both a 7pc increase in ancillaries and a 13pc rise in passengers are offset by 
negative yields from Q1-Q3 (-13pc, -20pc and -12pc in Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively). "We expect yields to reach an 
inflection point in Q4, turning positive with a 2.7pc rise in the quarter, bringing the full year decline to 12.5pc for 
2010." Positive news from the sector, improved booking profile management and a better route mix (with route 
expansion in Southern Europe) are yield enhancing and as such Goodbody are forecasting yields up 8pc in 2011 
(up 2pc, 8pc, 12pc, and 11pc in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 respectively). Disruption from the ash cloud could impact yields 
in 2011. The oil price has fallen nearly 30pc since the start of the year to USD 73 a barrel, having peaked at 
USD88.5 on May 3. Ryanair has hedged out 75pc of its 2011 requirements at an average price of USD72, so the 
broker said he would look positively on any further hedging below its forecast of dollar 75 a barrel for the unhedged 
portion.

The main Dublin shares index closed another turbulent week on a downer as it tracked world markets, which 
continue to be hit hard by the eurozone's debt crisis.
The ISEQ fell 51.82 points to 2,938.78.
World equities teetered and the euro resumed its decline on Friday as lacklustre U.S. economic data and concern 
over further fallout from the euro zone's debt crisis led investors to temper bets. The mixed U.S. reports failed to 
inspire traders who were shielding themselves ahead of long holiday weekends in London and New York. U.S. 
indexes were nearly 1pc lower. Fears persisted over contagion from debt-laden Greece after a bounce in global 
equities earlier this week. Despite the lack of major shocks from Spain, Portugal or Ireland, which all have heavy 
debt loads, investors were loath to add risky assets due to questions over global recovery forecasts. The euro fell 
0.13pc to USD1.2352 Friday, is down 7pc for the month and on course for its sixth consecutive monthly loss.
Bank shares again failed to light up the board with AIB stocks up just 1c to E1.04, Bank of Ireland was down 3c to 
E0.74 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 10c at E1.94. According to the latest railroad data for the week 
ended May, carloads of US aggregates increased by 22pc annually. This continues the strong momentum in the 
series (+13pc and +20pc in the previous two weeks) and leaves the year to date figure at +3pc. If this positive 
development in the data continues it would point to something more than just a catch-up on the weather affected 
start to the year, according to Goodbodys. "Our forecasts assume low single-digit volume growth for CRH's US 
materials business (circa 48pc of group profits), which compares to guidance given by Martin Marietta and Vulcan 
Materials of 2-4pc and 0-5pc, respectively." CRH shares fell 77c to E18.23. In its trading update issued this 
morning, online gambler, 888 has guided that it "now expects profit to be significantly lower than previous market 
expectations" given weakness in online poker, regulation of the French market and the expectation that online 
gaming will be difficult during the World Cup. Management noted that it "has continued to experience a difficult 
ISEQ closes a tough week on a low ISEQ Falls
trading environment across its products", with the exception of Bingo. There has been particular weakness in online 
poker, a trend it considers has been industry wide, with average players declining by about 18pc between January 
and May. Shares in Paddy Power climbed 5c to E24.60. Ryanair shares gained 5c to E3.30. The airline reports full 
year results on Tuesday. Goodbody are forecasting adjusted earnings per share of 22.3 cent and net profit of 
E317m, after the carrier raised guidance on April 1 from E275m to "no less than E310m". The broker expect 
revenues to rise 0.6pc to E2.3bn, as both a 7pc increase in ancillaries and a 13pc rise in passengers are offset by 
negative yields from Q1-Q3 (-13pc, -20pc and -12pc in Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively). "We expect yields to reach an 
inflection point in Q4, turning positive with a 2.7pc rise in the quarter, bringing the full year decline to 12.5pc for 
2010." Positive news from the sector, improved booking profile management and a better route mix (with route 
expansion in Southern Europe) are yield enhancing and as such Goodbody are forecasting yields up 8pc in 2011 
(up 2pc, 8pc, 12pc, and 11pc in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 respectively). Disruption from the ash cloud could impact yields 
in 2011. The oil price has fallen nearly 30pc since the start of the year to USD 73 a barrel, having peaked at 
USD88.5 on May 3. Ryanair has hedged out 75pc of its 2011 requirements at an average price of USD72, so the 
broker said he would look positively on any further hedging below its forecast of dollar 75 a barrel for the unhedged 
portion.

crew and engineers, it said.
The Irish airline will operate 270 weekly low fare flights to/from Barcelona El Prat in an investment of over USD350 
million in the airport. Ryanair's 20 new routes will be the first low fares routes to/from Barcelona El Prat and will

the airport, it said.
"Ryanair is delighted to announce Barcelona El Prat as our 42nd base with 20 new routes from September 2010 
which go on sale on www.ryanair.com tomorrow. Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fare routes from Barcelona El Prat 
will allow the airport to tap into the low fares market, which is the only market which continues to grow - thanks to

Aer Lingus sees a return to profits in 2011 but its biggest worry remains the fragile Irish economy as it emerges 
from one of the developed world's deepest recessions, it chief executive said.
Aer Lingus, which has been trying to reverse losses it has said were threatening its survival, has not participated in 
the wave of consolidation taking place across the industry much beyond code-sharing deals.
The former state carrier, which has fended off two hostile bids by shareholder Ryanair, said it was open to talking to 
other airlines about potential tie-ups.
"We are interested in partnerships, we are interested in extending our global network to and from Ireland," 
Christoph Mueller told Reuters Insider on Wednesday, adding there was no specific airline it was talking to right 
now. "Consolidation is the name of the game at this point in time," he said, referring to mergers such as those 
planned by British Airways and Iberia as well as UAL's United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. Aer Lingus 
already has codesharing or joint ticketing deals with United and New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp. Asked 
when in 2011 the airline would return to profits, he said: "We rely on the economists' outlook and currently the 
common sense is that it will be in the first or second quarter." Analysts expect Aer Lingus to return to positive 
earnings per share of 0.05 euro next year from a projected loss of 0.02 euro in 2010, according to Thomson 
Reuters I/B/E/S. Analyst Joe Gill at brokerage Bloxham said it was plausible Aer Lingus will return to profit next year 
but it was less clear how sustainable profits would be. "(Mueller) has brought a new broom to the business, he's 
decided to be very aggressive in terms of improving the cost base," Gill said, noting Aer Lingus was likely to end up 
being taken over by a bigger airline in line with industry trends. Aer Lingus shares -- of which Ryanair, the 
government and employees control 70 percent -- were up 5.7 percent at 0.690 euros by 1042 GMT, down from a 
high of 0.695 euros earlier and half the level Ryanair offered to pay in late 2008. "The biggest concern ... is the Irish 
economy," Mueller said. "We have the steepest decline in economical output ever seen in Ireland," he said, adding 
Aer Lingus sees return to profit in 2011 A Lin 11 Profit
unemployment estimated at 13.4 percent in April was also a worry as it hit outbound travel. Aer Lingus carried over 
a quarter fewer passengers in April year-on-year after a volcanic ash cloud stopped it fully operating for a week. 
Mueller reiterated ash-related disruption would cut earnings by about 20 million euros. Investors have especially 
worried about the rate Aer Lingus was burning through its cash reserves but Mueller said the business was not 
haemorrhaging cash any more. "We are quite positive that our cash balance will be more than positive towards the 
end of the year, so there is no net cash burn for Aer Lingus at this point in time," he said. Aer Lingus, whose 
operating loss quadrupled in 2009, aims to cut costs by an annual 97 million euros and Mueller said this remained 
on track with only a small delay due to the ash crisis. "We do expect a run rate (saving) this year of 50 million euros 
... and to deliver the full 97 million euros towards the end of 2011," he said. Ryanair, due to release full-year results 
next Tuesday, expects to swing strongly back into profit after posting its first loss in 20 years a year ago.

next Tuesday, expects to swing strongly back into profit after posting its first loss in 20 years a year ago.

The ISEQ put in a lacklustre performance, adding slightly to the huge loses made last week with little hope that the 
eurozone debt crisis will ease this week.
The index fell 1.69 points to 2,886.14.
Davy points out that the last seven weeks have not been a crisis in confidence about government credit in a general 
sense. That would be the worst-case scenario for risk markets. "It is worth pointing out that the blowout in spreads 
in peripheral Europe has been accompanied by a massive rally in 'core' government bonds (especially Germany) 
and in the US. It is of course important that those larger countries don't become complacent: Germany is set to cut 
its deficit even further, whereas the US must get more serious. But continued economic recovery will make 
servicing costs easier across the board."
Shares in the banks in Dublin mostly fell nevertheless. AIB dropped 4c to E1.04. Bank of Ireland also lost 4c to 
E0.73 and Irish Life and Permanent dipped 9c to E2.07. Reports indicate that the Department of Finance has 
confirmed that banks will face higher rates for using the government guarantee scheme from the end of June. In 
recent weeks, speculation has increased that the Minister for Finance is seeking an extension of the existing 
guarantee from end September to end December. It will be subsequently phased out, but it appears the cost is 
rising and will probably not surprise too many people. It appears the new fee structure will have fees varying by 
credit worthiness and banks will have to submit reviews to the EU demonstrating their creditworthiness. According 
to HM Revenue and Customs, on a seasonally adjusted basis UK housing transactions (with a value of £40,000 
and over) were 78,000 in April, 25pc higher than April last year. Transactions in April were 4,000 above that of 
March and slightly higher than the average of 76,000 from June to November of last year. Shares in CRH gained 1c

Ryanair likely to block Aer Lingus resolution

Body
Ryanair is preparing to block a fresh attempt by Aer Lingus to pass a key resolution at the former state airline's agm 
next month.
Michael O'Leary's airline, which has a 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, is expected to veto a motion that would allow 
the company to bypass existing shareholders if it seeks to issue fresh shares.
If Ryanair votes as expected, this will be the fourth time that Aer Lingus has failed to get the motion approved. 
Ryanair voted against the motion at two previous agms, while the airline's board withdrew the motion without 
putting it to a vote at a third agm.
The motion was backed by a majority of shareholders at both of the previous votes but, as it was deemed on each 
occasion to be a special resolution, it needed the support of 75 per cent of shareholders to be passed.
Aer Lingus has described the resolution as technical in nature and said the failure to win shareholder backing would 
not affect the airline's day-to-day operations.
O'Leary has selectively used the airline's stake in Aer Lingus to oppose motions recommended by its board.
However, a number of shareholder votes, which required simple majorities rather than 75 per cent backing, have 
been carried despite Ryanair's opposition.
Next month's agm will also allow Aer Lingus shareholders to vote for the first time on the appointment of chief 
executive Christoph Mueller, who took up office last September and who must be approved in a shareholder vote.
Ryanair is not expected to vote against Mueller's appointment.

The main Dublin shares index slumped further this morning as the US outlined how it plans to crackdown on market 
regulation after Germany earlier proposed radical changes to shorting and other investment mechanisms.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 43.61 points to 2,838.51.
Irish equities suffered along with those around Europe. European stocks fell again on Friday despite German 
approval of a euro zone rescue package, as markets remained unconvinced the aid would resolve the debt crisis. 
The euro, however, found support from short covering. Wall Street was also set to open lower, after plunging nearly 
4 percent in the previous session. In the general flight to safety bund futures extended their gains, up 28 ticks on 
the day to 128.59, with the German 10-year government bond yield hitting a record low at 2.656 percent. "We are 
heading into the U.S. session here and the markets want to be better bid. The market is just anticipating more risk 
aversion trades ... People are still shedding risk and risk assets," a bond trader said. World stocks as measured by 
the MSCI All-Country index were down 0.41 percent, with the more volatile emerging markets component down 
0.38 percent. The euro continued to benefit from hedge funds scrambling to cover short positions and rose 0.32 
percent to dollar 1.2501.
Bank shares fell again. AIB dropped 3c to E1.02, Bank of Ireland fell 5c to E0.72 and Irish Life and Permanent was 
down 7c to E2.11. On the day that the IBF/PwC mortgage market profile revealed that the number of mortgages 
issued in Q1 2010 fell by 37pc year-on-year, Moody's reported that 90 days-plus arrears in Irish prime residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) portfolios had risen to 3.8pc in March 2010, from 2.1pc a year ago. Prime 
RMBS issues account for E42bn (about 29pc) of the total Irish mortgage stock of E146bn. The aggregates freight 
data in the US continues to improve. Total carloads of crushed stone shipped by rail in the US increased 20pc in

increased 6pc in March, 10pc in April and in the first weeks of May are up 19pc year-on-year. CRH shares fell 50c 
to E17.10. A German court ruling forbids Ryanair from charging German customers a fee for using credit or debit 
cards to pay for flights. Customers were found to be at a "disproportionate disadvantage" in a case taken by one of 
Germany's main consumer organisations. The court found that customers were offered no opportunity to pay for 
flights without paying extra and while Ryanair countered that it was passing on the fee banks charge and customers 
could pay via Visa Electron, the court dismissed this argument and indicated that the airline must provide an 
established way of payment that doesn't require additional effort by the consumer. Ryanair's shares fell 12c to

Ryanair today denied that a German court ruling means that it can no longer charge fees on credit card payments.
Reports said that Ryanair has been forbidden from charging German customers a fee for using a credit or debit 
card to pay for flights.
Germany's federal court of justice found yesterday that Ryanair placed consumers at a "disproportionate 
disadvantage" by offering no way to pay for flights without incurring a fee.
"By charging the fee is shifting in a one-sided manner on to customers the costs of fulfilling its own legal obligations 
... without bringing any service in return," said the court, a practice at odds with German law. Ryanair today said it 
wants to correct the "false statements" made by the German consumer organisation (VZBV), and repeated in 
today's Irish Times newspaper, following yesterday's Supreme Court ruling in Germany. "VZBV wrongly claimed 
that airlines will now be banned from charging credit card fees. This is untrue. The German Court ruling clearly said 
that credit card fees are legal and can be applied as long as a widely available free payment method is offered." 
"The German Court's ruling vindicates Ryanair's position that credit card fees are legal as long as a free payment 
method is offered." Ryanair's lawyers have written today to the VZBV and the Irish Times demanding retraction of 
yesterday's false statements.

card to pay for flights.
Germany's federal court of justice found yesterday that Ryanair placed consumers at a "disproportionate 
disadvantage" by offering no way to pay for flights without incurring a fee.
"By charging the fee is shifting in a one-sided manner on to customers the costs of fulfilling its own legal obligations 
... without bringing any service in return," said the court, a practice at odds with German law. Ryanair today said it 
wants to correct the "false statements" made by the German consumer organisation (VZBV), and repeated in 
today's Irish Times newspaper, following yesterday's Supreme Court ruling in Germany. "VZBV wrongly claimed 
that airlines will now be banned from charging credit card fees. This is untrue. The German Court ruling clearly said 
that credit card fees are legal and can be applied as long as a widely available free payment method is offered." 
"The German Court's ruling vindicates Ryanair's position that credit card fees are legal as long as a free payment 
method is offered." Ryanair's lawyers have written today to the VZBV and the Irish Times demanding retraction of 
yesterday's false statements.

Ryanair today rejected claims about the airline's contracts, employees and their tax arrangements at its Marseille 
base, saying it will pull out of the base if challenged by prosecutors.
Ryanair condemned an article in Le Figaro on the 2nd May as 'false and misleading'. The article in question alleges 
that Ryanair employees are not fully paying their tax, social insurance and pensions contributions as required by EU 
law.
The statement released by the airline today says, "Ryanair has invested over E300m in its Marseille base since 
2006 comprising four new B737 aircraft - all of them Irish registered (and therefore Irish territory) - over 120 pilots 
and cabin crew operating a network of 26 mainly international flights. Since the launch of the base in 2006, 
Ryanair's traffic at Marseille has risen from 200,000 to over 1.7m in 2010, with Ryanair bringing almost 1m inbound 
visitors annually to Marseille (and Aix-en-Provence), sustaining over 1,500 local jobs in and around Marseille 
Airport."
Ryanair is currently taking an action in the European Court of Human Rights against France to challenge a 2007 
decree which attempts to impose legislation on international transport companies in France. Speaking today in 
Paris, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said, "Ryanair sincerely regrets the false and inaccurate claims made recently 
about our Marseille base in the French press, which failed to report Ryanair's response. These allegations were 
inaccurate and designed to damage Ryanair's operations in Marseille, as well as our investment in France. All of 
Ryanair's mobile employees are employed on lawful EU contracts. They are required to - and do - pay taxes, social 
insurance and pension fees in accordance with EU regulations as a condition of their employment in Ryanair."

Ryanair today said that it is to locate a new hangar and 200 jobs in Frankfurt Hahn Airport in Germany and not 
Dublin Airport.
This new facility and jobs will replace those previously offered to the Irish Government earlier this year in the empty 
Hangar 6 at Dublin Airport, said Ryanair.
The maintenance hangar and crew training facility will see Ryanair invest E25m and will include two aircraft 
simulators and a 16 room cabin crew training centre.
Ryanair regrets that even today, many months later, Hangar 6 remains unused for base maintenance, while up to 
900 SRT Engineers remain unemployed, drawing the dole. Many of these people could have found skilled, well paid 
work, with Ryanair, had the Irish Government accepted the airline's offer to buy or lease Hangar 6 and divert a 
significant proportion of Ryanair's base maintenance to Dublin Airport, a statement said. Speaking today in 
Germany, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said it was Irish Government inaction that pushed the airline in to the decision. 
"While we are pleased to announce this new investment in Germany and Frankfurt Hahn Airport, I regret that the 
Irish Government stood idly by and did nothing to win these new jobs for Ireland. The Irish Government talks a lot 
about competitiveness, but is short on action. At a time when traffic and tourism is collapsing in Ireland, the Irish 
Government prefers to impose tourist taxes, and order big increases in Dublin Airport's fees, rather than work with 
the world's largest airline to lower access costs, win investment in maintenance or create hundreds of well paid 
engineering jobs at Dublin Airport. Sadly in Ireland, we are stuck with a Government which likes talking about the 
"smart economy" but prefers implementing "dumb policy". The sooner they reverse these tourist taxes and slash 
high costs at the Government owned DAA airports, then the sooner Irish airports and tourism can return to low cost 
access and traffic growth," he said.

Inside the plume room: tracking Europe's ash cloud
Inside the plume room: tracking Europe's ash cloud

When ash spews from an Icelandic volcano, 10 British scientists using laser sensors, satellite pictures and a 
specially equipped jet must tell the world where it's going.
The grit can block flight paths and shut airports, so the fate of millions of travelers, and billions in revenue, rides on 
the projections of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Exeter, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of 
London.
Their British base one of nine global volcanic ash advisory centers has been on high alert since Iceland's 
Eyjafjallajokul (pronounced ay-yah-FYAH-lah-yer-kuhl) volcano erupted in April, shutting down global travel for five 
days. It has caused sporadic disruptions since then, closing London's Heathrow and Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport 
two of Europe's busiest hubs over the weekend.
One rattled airline executive Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has already attacked the "imaginary black plumes" 
predicted by the team's computing models, which he blames for prompting excessive caution and wrongly curtailing 
air traffic.
"When you get a big volcanic event it gets very, very busy and very, very stressful," said Tony Hall, director of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Alaska Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Anchorage.
"These things can go on for weeks, or months it can be a very stressful time," said Hall, who has had contact with 
his colleagues in London since Eyjafjallajokul's eruption.
Sarah Jackson, the British center's atmospheric dispersion group manager, said the scientific model used to predict 
the spread of ash and other dangerous particles was developed to track contamination from the 1986 Chernobyl 
nuclear reactor disaster.
In a video produced by the office to explain its work, she said the modeling uses latest available data and then 
takes into account wind patterns and the effects of turbulence, ash settling on the ground, and washout caused by 
rain or snow.
Inside the plume room: tracking Europe's ash cloud
But, the scientists themselves acknowledge their predictions can be sketchy, and warn that long-term forecasts are 
rarely correct. They caution that all estimates of ash movement can quickly become outdated as wind patterns 
change.
Keith Groves, executive director of Britain's Met Office the country's national weather forecasting service, and a 
commercial arm of the defense ministry said the scientists use sophisticated equipment and have a strong record in 
their assessments.
"We're quite confident that we're producing accurate and useful predictions," Groves said, in a video produced by 
his office.
The British staff tracked emissions from the 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires in the first Gulf War and a major 2005 fire at an oil 
depot north of London, the biggest blaze in Europe since World War II.
To predict the path of the ash, they scrutinize reports from Iceland, sift through reports from airline pilots flying over 
Europe known as pireps and consult satellite and polar orbiter imagery of the ash cloud. Data is also collected from 
laser sensors, called lidar or light detection and ranging, based around Britain and used commonly in atmospheric 
research and to monitor cloud particles.
More data comes from research flights, including a jet owned by Britain's Natural Environment Research Council 
used almost daily through April to test the composition of the ash clouds, check the size of the ash particles and 
monitor levels of sulfur dioxide.
Those flights have sometimes been perilous on May 4, a journey from southern England to Scotland was aborted 
after sensors detected a rising levels of ash particles. Ash can clog jet engines.
Hall said staff at the volcanic ash centers input data into computers running weather and ash dispersion modeling 
software. Resulting maps showing where ash clouds are likely to travel are then either hand drawn, or printed.
Scientists keep in regular contact with their overseas counterparts by e-mail and phone, updating each other about 
their latest predictions.
Through April, British forecasters prepared 18-hour projections of the movement of ash across Europe, as 
regulators carefully monitored the safety of the continent's airspace. Beginning last week the ash experts have also 
published five-day forecasts, on the orders of Britain's new government.
Met Office spokesman John Hammond stressed the new five-day charts are only an indication of the likely volcanic 
activity, and said that long term predictions of wind patterns are notoriously unreliable.
Some tour operators and airlines say they're skeptical that the scientists can make any accurate long term 
predictions.
Frances Tuke, a spokeswoman for ABTA, the Association of British Travel Agents, said the new charts can only go 
so far to eliminate travelers' uncertainty.
"It is helpful, but we do have to give it a degree of caution. Our experience has shown so far that this is quite a 
dynamic situation that can change rapidly," she said.
But Ryanair's O'Leary said the new charts should be scrapped, and the entire process of predicting the ash cloud's 
movement overhauled.
"It is frankly ridiculous that the flight plans of millions of air passengers across Europe are being disrupted on a daily 
basis by an outdated, inappropriate and imaginary computer-generated model and it is time that these charts were 
done away with," he said.

depot north of London, the biggest blaze in Europe since World War II.
To predict the path of the ash, they scrutinize reports from Iceland, sift through comments from pilots airlines flying 
over Europe known as pireps and consult satellite and polar orbiter imagery of the ash cloud. Data is also collected 
from laser sensors, called lidar or light detection and ranging, based around Britain and used commonly in 
atmospheric research and to monitor cloud particles.
More data comes from research flights, including a jet owned by Britain's Natural Environment Research Council 
used almost daily through April to test the composition of the ash clouds, check the size of the ash particles and 
monitor levels of sulfur dioxide.
Those flights have sometimes been perilous on May 4, a journey from southern England to Scotland was aborted 
after sensors detected a rising levels of ash particles. Ash can clog jet engines.
Hall said staff at the centers input data into computers running weather and ash dispersion modeling software. 
Resulting maps showing where ash clouds are likely to travel are then either hand drawn, or printed.
Scientists keep in regular contact with their overseas counterparts by e-mail and phone, updating each other about 
their latest predictions.
Through April, British forecasters prepared 18-hour projections of the movement of ash across Europe, as 
regulators carefully monitored the safety of the continent's airspace. Beginning last week the ash experts have also 
published five-day forecasts, on the orders of Britain's new government.
Met Office spokesman John Hammond stressed the new five-day charts are only an indication of the likely volcanic 
activity, and said that long term predictions of wind patterns are notoriously unreliable.
Some tour operators and airlines say they're skeptical that the scientists can make any accurate long term 
predictions.
Frances Tuke, a spokeswoman for ABTA, the association of British travel agents, said the new charts can only go 
so far to eliminate travelers' uncertainty.
"It is helpful, but we do have to give it a degree of caution. Our experience has shown so far that this is quite a 
dynamic situation that can change rapidly," she said.
But Ryanair's O'Leary said the new charts should be scrapped, and the entire process of predicting the ash cloud's 
movement overhauled.
"It is frankly ridiculous that the flight plans of millions of air passengers across Europe are being disrupted on a daily 
basis by an outdated, inappropriate and imaginary computer-generated model and it is time that these charts were 
done away with," he said.

Budget carrier Ryanair is dismissing the Italian civil aviation agency's decision to fine it for allegedly failing to help 
passengers stranded by Iceland's volcanic ash cloud.
Ryanair says the fine was "biased" because it was not imposed on any other airline. It also says the ENAC agency 
failed to allow the carrier to explain itself before announcing the (EURO)3 million ($3.7 million) fine.
Ryanair said Tuesday it will vigorously defend or appeal any fines.
Reacting to the carrier's assertions, ENAC said it "fully confirms the legitimacy of fines." The agency said almost all 
other airlines gave passengers stranded in Italian airports the assistance legally due to them.

European stocks closed lower yesterday in volatile trade with miners leading the fallers on the FTSE Eurofirst 300 
as copper prices plunged.
The index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,013.06.
French mining group, Eramet , lost 1.3 per cent to EUR235.50 while Boliden in Sweden dipped 1.4 per cent to 
SKr91.45.
Oil stocks led gains in earlier trade after BP took action to stop the oil leak in the Mexican gulf. Total in France rose 
0.2 per cent to EUR38.51 and Repsol in Spain added 0.5 per cent to EUR16.36.
Worries about eurozone deficits continued to weigh on Greece. The Athens General index weakened 1.4 per cent 
to 1,634.61 following remarks on Sunday by German chancellor Angela Merkel, who said that the EUR750bn 
($927bn) European Union Greek bail-out had only bought the eurozone time, but the region's fiscal problems 
remained.
Greek banks fell, with the euro sliding to a four-year low as investors feared that planned austerity measures in the 
eurozone's periphery economies would hurt Europe's economic growth. National Bank of Greece fell 2.7 per cent 
to EUR10.53, Bank of Greece  lost 2.3 per cent to EUR36.53 and EFG Eurobank held steady at EUR4.80. 
Analysts remained broadly negative on the country's banks even after the record bail-out.
Meanwhile, Italy's Banco Popolare surged as investors welcomed better-than-expected earnings. Credit Suisse 
said "the future looked brighter" for the stock and upgraded it from "underperform" to "outperform". The shares 
closed 6.9 per cent higher at EUR4.44 after they were suspended from trading following gains of nearly 10 per cent.
Hochtief , the German construction group, sank 7.7 per cent to EUR54.33 after posting weaker first quarter new 
orders numbers in spite of its reporting a net profit of EUR33.1m, beating analysts' expectations.
Miners lead declines amid volatile trade
The company has been under fire in recent days over rumours, denied by Hochtief, that there were problems with 
the quality of some supporting structures in a EUR500m project in Hamburg.
Airlines suffered as volcanic ash from Iceland caused widespread disruption at airports in northern Europe, 
grounding 1,000 flights.
Ryanair fell 3.5 per cent to EUR3.23, Air France-KLM lost 3.2 per cent to EUR9.98, while Iberia dipped 1.5 per 
cent to EUR2.23.
Infineon , the German chipmaker, added 0.9 per cent to EUR5.08 on reports that the company was in negotiations 
with US peer Intel about the sale of Infineon's mobile phone chip business.
The company pared gains on news that Europe's largest chipmaker alongside eight other memory chip makers 
including Samsung Electronics and Hynix Semiconductor would be expected to face European Union fines this 
week on charges of illegally fixing prices.
Finnish paper makers gained on the back of a weaker euro and a broker upgrade. UPM-Kymmene rose 2.9 per 
cent to EUR10.89 and Stora Enso gained 2.6 per cent to EUR6.04. Pulp prices are set to reach record highs in the 
next few weeks.
Gamesa , the Spanish wind-turbine maker, edged 0.1 per cent higher after rival Suzlon Energy in India said there 
was great potential for wind power in the Middle East, especially in the windiest countries of Iran, Egypt, Morocco 
and Oman. Gamesa was also boosted by a broker upgrade.
Pharmaceutical stocks were higher. Sanofi-Aventis in France added 0.4 per cent to EUR50.66 and Roche in 
Switzerland advanced 0.3 per cent to SFr163.90.

All airports in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are now open, after being shut over the weekend due to the 
return of Icelandic volcanic ash to UK airspace.
Heathrow and Gatwick airports are now running a full service after dealing with serious disruption to flight schedules 
since Sunday.
Just Orkney and Shetland Islands airports are to remain in the no-fly zone until at least 19:00 this evening.
Meanwhile in The Republic of Ireland, Dublin airport also re-opened at 12:00 today, as did Donegal airport at 14:00 
and Sligo airport at 10:00, according to the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). The IAA also said it does not anticipate 
putting any further restrictions in place due to volcanic ash for at least the next 48 hours.
You can find out more about your rights if your flights are cancelled here.
The news comes just two days after Italy's civil aviation authority fined the Irish airline Ryanair 3 million euros for 
failing to provide passengers stranded by the Icelandic volcanic ash with the proper care as set out by European 
legislation.
Meanwhile, British Airways cabin crew are preparing to strike tomorrow in the first of a series of four separate five-
day strikes over pay and working conditions.
British Airways is currently at the High Court trying to prevent the strike tomorrow from going ahead, claiming the 
ballot was flawed. The government and conciliation service Acas continue to encourage BA and Unite union to 
agree a settlement.

Italy's civil aviation agency says it has fined Ryanair around (EURO)3 million ($3.7 million) for failing to help 
passengers stranded last month when flights were canceled because of Iceland's volcanic ash cloud.
The ENAC agency said in a statement Saturday it had found 178 cases of Ryanair passengers who didn't receive 
mandatory assistance such as food, drink and lodgings during the flight shutdown in much of Europe from April 15-
22.
Ryanair said the company hadn't been informed of the fine.

Nessa Childers MEP has accused the EU Commission of "wilfully breaking its own Code of Conduct on jobs in the

Ryanair.
The Labour MEP said, "The parachuting of Charlie McCreevy into a lucrative new job on the board of Ryanair has 
made a mockery of the European Commission's own rules. The Code of Conduct stipulates that former 
Commissioners may not assume roles related to their previous portfolios for a period of at least a year. This 
decision has not only succeeded in breaking the spirit of the Code but it has undermined the whole set of principles 
underpinning the Code for post-office employment of former Commissioners.
"This unwelcome development is proof positive that a set of clear and enforceable new rules with tough sanctions 
are demanded to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest between former Commissioners, their old portfolios 
and their new jobs in the private sector.
"I believe that if any former Commissioner is found to have broken the rules, then effective sanctions must be 
considered including amongst other things the withholding of their generous pensions." "In addition to Mr. 
McCreevy, three other former Commissioners have accepted positions in the private sector. Austrian Benita 
Ferrero-Waldner (Munich Re), German Gunter Verheugen (Royal Bank of Scotland) and Bulgaria's Meglena 
Kuneva (BNP Paribas) have all assumed plum corporate jobs on the back of their experience serving in the

From Mr Matt Andersson.
Sir, It is telling that the twin challenges of airline labour relations and carrier mergers are occupying the front lines of 
industry issues. Together they tell a core story about airline economics ("BA and Unite square up for strike", May 
12).
The presence or absence of organised labour wage rates at BA may actually be of little economic consequence 
(versus confrontational labour law, which can be). The most unionised carrier in the US is Southwest Airlines. It 
sustains above-market wage rates across most labour categories. It is also the most consistently profitable and 
hosts a rare credit balance sheet. Its success stems from larger business and market structure factors, including 
network and system design, acquisition of certain rivals, and its ability to manage average fares within its effective 
sector monopoly.
Even if BA's crew costs are adjusted down to market - indeed, even if other input costs are relieved - its 
diseconomies stemming from excessive competition and supply levels and their associated cost and pricing 
penalties are overwhelming.
Moreover, becoming "Ryanair-esque" (Lex, May 12), is about much more than labour costs. The most prosperous 
and valued carriers are specialists in a specialised market: low-cost regional, long-haul or freight, among others. 
The only other initial path for large generalists such as BA, other than exit, is full and permanent anti-trust immunity, 
and its associated reductions in contested markets.
A true victory, rather than over labour, can be declared when BA is able to realise economies from consolidation 
and eventual operational and asset integration with its global alliance partners. Market structure, not input cost per 
se, is the independent variable of airline health.

A small number of interconnected businesspeople operated at the apex of Irish business during the boom years 
2005-2007, awarding themselves huge salary increases and perks while several of them ran their companies in to

In a major new piece of research, Mapping the Golden Circle, equality think-tank TASC has revealed the extent of 
the network across 40 of Ireland's top private companies and state-owned bodies in that period.
Together, these companies employed 310,000 people and had a combined turnover (or equivalent) of nearly

household names and include Bord Gais, the Central Bank, AIB, Smurfit, Anglo Irish Bank, Ryanair and Aer Lingus. 
The total number of directors involved in managing these companies was 572. In the period 2005-2007, a network 
of 39 people held positions in 33 of the 40 top private companies and state-owned bodies. Between them, these 39 
- referred to as the Director Network in TASC's report - held a total of 93 directorships. Mapping the Golden Circle 
also provides evidence that there was a trend of "excessive remuneration" for the CEOs of both state-owned and 
private companies. On average, their pay rose by over 40pc between 2005 and 2007, while combined inflation for 
these two years ran at just over 9pc. TASC director and co-author of the report Paula Clancy said today: "The 
economic crisis has rightly focused attention on how we run our businesses. Corporate governance is at risk when 
people are overextended. Mapping the Golden Circle shows where the risk of overextension lies. We know too that 
when people know each other very well and share similar backgrounds, as many in the Director Network do, 
companies run the risk of 'groupthink', where decisions are made that ignore alternative evidence as a result of a 
group's desire to reach consensus." Ms Clancy said that this piece of research should be used to pave the way for 
improved corporate governance in the future. "Ireland now needs a new statutory basis for corporate governance.

This could include substantially restricting the number of directorships an individual can hold, reducing or

A small number of interconnected businesspeople operated at the apex of Irish business during the boom years 
2005-2007, awarding themselves huge salary increases and perks while several of them ran their companies in to 
the ground, according to a report from independent economic think-tank, TASC.
In a major new piece of research, Mapping the Golden Circle, equality think-tank TASC has revealed the extent of 
the network across 40 of Ireland's top private companies and state-owned bodies in that period.
Together, these companies employed 310,000 people and had a combined turnover (or equivalent) of nearly 
EUR80 billion.

Cabin crew, take your seats and prepare never to take off. The suicidal streak of British Airways' flight attendants 
jeopardises the airline's survival. BA has cut capacity but must still slash costs to offset lower passenger numbers 
and competition from no-frills carriers on short-haul routes. March's two waves of strikes and April's Icelandic ash 
were damaging enough; flight attendants now plan 20 days of walkouts. As before, BA will mitigate the fallout by 
(expensively) leasing aircraft and rebooking passengers on alternative flights. However, although BA shares have 
outperformed the FTSE All-Share index this year, Willie Walsh, the airline's pugnacious chief executive, should not 
count on investor support indefinitely.
March's seven days of walkouts, after all, are estimated to have cost up to £45m. UBS estimates the latest walkout 
will cost BA about £5m a day, putting the dispute's total cost at up to £145m, roughly equivalent to a third of the full-
year loss that BA is expected to announce on May 21. No-frills competitors EasyJet and Ryanair benefited from 
rebooked passengers and leasing out their aircraft in the first wave of strikes, and could do so again. Meanwhile, 
ash cloud disruption has cost BA an estimated £15m-£20m a day in lost revenues and additional costs. But ash-
related costs might not affect its bottom line in the longer term as the European Commission is expected to allow 
state aid to airlines affected.
Industrial relations, however, are man-made. Investors might take BA's dispute costs on the chin if Mr Walsh 
achieves his targeted £50m of annual savings. They accept that BA needs to emerge from the downturn with a 
Ryanair-esque attitude to cost. But for the maths to work, passengers also need to have an incentive to choose BA. 
Cabin crew and Mr Walsh appear to have overlooked that.

What is it with unpronounceable names, eruptions and airlines? Moments after unveiling a £50m-£75m hole in its 
bottom line courtesy of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, EasyJet was dealt a blow by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou . 
Despite having more than a passing interest in the performance of the discount airline's shares, Sir Stelios decided 
to blast its performance under outgoing chief executive Andy Harrison.
Like the volcano, Sir Stelios's outbursts are unpredictable and the fallout indiscriminate. His long-running beef with 
Mr Harrison is over the latter's supposed pro-growth strategy - a strategy, however, that was anointed by the board 
and merely executed by its chief executive.
But does the embittered shareholder have a point? Sir Stelios is absolutely correct to say shares have gone 
sideways under Mr Harrison's stewardship. From the day he took up the reins in December 2005 to the 
announcement of his intention to quit four years later, the share price has barely budged (albeit that it hit some 
higher peaks in between, and slightly outpaced its peer, Ryanair). He did not quite double the size of the fleet, 
although with an extra 80 planes plying the skies you might be miffed that this year's profits before tax - assuming 
projections are met - will only reach roughly the level of 2006. The absence of a dividend is galling, especially with 
£1.36bn of cash on the balance sheet. Sure, this is a cyclical industry that is prey to all the gods can throw at it, 
from pestilence to war. And true, given the travails of bigger brethren such as British Airways, EasyJet and Mr 
Harrison deserve kudos for delivering any profits at all. But as she prepares to slip into the captain's seat, Carolyn 
McCall , ex-chief executive of Guardian Media Group, should be under no illusions. Turbulence is the norm, 
especially when an irascible would-be co-pilot is on board.

Temasek has no chip on its shoulder about resources

Body
Who needs Chip Goodyear? Temasek, the Singapore state investment fund, last year hired the celebrated former 
head of Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton to be its next chief executive.
The prevailing theory was that Mr Goodyear would help the fund increase its focus on resources, a sector it had 
overlooked while gorging on financial stocks including Merrill Lynch and Barclays.
Mr Goodyear left by mutual agreement last year, before he formally took office, but that hasn't stopped Temasek 
fishing for energy-related deals.
Last November the fund, with little fanfare, invested C$310m ($305m) in debentures issued by Toronto-listed Niko 
Resources, to help bankroll a deal connected to Indonesian offshore energy projects.
Its latest deal involves spending at least $500m to acquire convertible preference stock in Chesapeake Energy, a 
US-listed leading producer of natural gas.
It will almost certainly acquire a slug of a second tranche of preference stock being issued by Chesapeake in the 
next 30 days.
Gas is trading at less than a third of the price of oil on an equivalent basis but Temasek and associated Asian 
investors are bullish for the commodity, citing the US push against using oil for new power plants and cars.
Asia's sovereign wealth funds are increasingly focused on the resources sector, not least in US-listed companies. 
Earlier this year, China Investment Corp disclosed its US investments: the lengthy list includes a holding in 
Chesapeake.
Turbulence as standard 
What is it with unpronounceable names, eruptions and airlines? Just moments after unveiling a £50m-£75m ($75m-
$112m) hole in its bottom line courtesy of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, EasyJet, the UK-based budget 
airline, was dealt a blow by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. In spite of having more than a passing interest in the 
Temasek has no chip on its shoulder about resources
performance of the discount airline's shares, Sir Stelios decided yesterday to blast its performance under Andy 
Harrison, the outgoing chief executive.
Like the Icelandic volcano, Sir Stelios's outbursts are unpredictable and the fallout somewhat indiscriminate. His 
long-running beef with Mr Harrison is over the latter's supposed pro-growth strategy - a strategy, however, that was 
anointed by the board and simply executed by its chief executive. Besides, growth is surely the whole point of 
newcomers; steadiness and dividends should be the preserve of the oldies.
But does the rancorous shareholder have a point? Sir Stelios is absolutely correct to say shares have gone 
sideways under Mr Harrison's stewardship. From the day he took up the reins in December 2005 to the 
announcement of his intention to quit four years later, the share price has barely budged (albeit hitting some heady 
heights in between times, and slightly outpacing its nearest peer, Ryanair).
He did not quite double the size of the aircraft fleet, although given there are now an extra 70 planes plying the 
skies one might be understandably miffed that this year's profits before tax - assuming projections are met - will 
also be running at roughly 2006 levels.
Sure, this is a cyclical industry that is prey to all the gods can throw at it, from pestilence to war.
It is also true that, given the travails of its bigger brethren such as British Airways, EasyJet and Mr Harrison deserve 
kudos for delivering any profits at all. But as she prepares to slip into the driving seat, Carolyn McCall, former chief 
executive of the Guardian Media Group, should be under no illusions. Turbulence is par for the course, especially 
with an irascible would-be co-pilot.
Superjumbo dig at BA 
Air France is considering deploying next month one of its brand new Airbus A380 superjumbo airliners on its Paris-
London Heathrow shuttle service. The A380, seating as many as 800 passengers in some configurations, is 
designed to serve long- haul routes. But Air France, which already operates A380 services from Paris to New York 
and Johannesburg, is planning to fly the aircraft on the short cross-Channel route to speed up the training 
programme of crew members before it takes delivery of new A380s.
At least that is the official explanation. Yet one cannot help suspecting that the French carrier could also be 
mounting a cunning and well timed marketing ploy by flying its superjumbos into BA's Heathrow backyard. After all, 
its British competitor is facing a potentially crippling 20-day strike by cabin crew from next week and has already 
deferred its order for 12 A380 superjumbos.

Irish shares have rallied this morning from a negative start as investors look to a calmer international environment 
ahead.
With a deficit cutting coalition installed in Britain, and Germany yesterday's approving the E750bn euro bailout, 
calmer market conditions are beginning to seem likely.
In addition, a falling euro rate against sterling - it's down to 84.50p this morning - bodes well for Irish economic 
recovery.
The ISEQ index was 6 points down shortly after the opening this morning, but has recovered to go 46.87 points 
ahead a short time ago at 3,222.69. Banks are all well up, with AIB ahead by 7c to 139 and Bank of Ireland lifting 6c

gain of 48c to 1306 after it issued an upbeat forward outlook this morning. CRH is ahead by 13c to 1992 and 
Smurfit Kappa has risen by 5c to 725. Ryanair has lifted by 9c to 351.

The impressive rebound on the Dublin shares market took a severe knock this morning as global investors 
abandoned initial euphoria over the ECB's E750bn rescue packaged and fretted over the ability of some eurozone 
States to rein in deficits.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 75.49 points to 3,141.78.
European equity markets increased strongly on Monday, registering their biggest one-day percentage rise in 17 
months, on the back of the weekend announcement of a support package from the ECB. The package consists of 
E750bn in loans and guarantees for euro-zone governments together with the promise that the ECB will intervene 
in government bond markets. But today was a different story as some investors doubted whether there is the 
political will in some eurozone States to bring in the kind of stringent cutting of spending needed to slash their huge 
budgetary deficits. "The developments politically could potentially undermine the markets in the short term," said 
Tim Whitehead, portfolio manager at Redmayne Bentley. "The realisation that the euro package put together over 
the weekend is not a panacea is beginning to dawn as well. And now, potentially, China is perhaps looking to rein in 
growth even further."
Shares in Dublin's listed banks - big gainers on Monday - were big fallers this morning with AIB down 10c to E1.28, 
Bank of Ireland dropped 5c to E1.63 and Irish Life and Permanent lost 13c to E2.59. Led by a significant year-on-
year improvement in Irish dairy ingredients performance, Glanbia expects a strong first-half profits recovery and for 
this to carry through into mid-teen earnings growth for 2010. On the assumption of 15pc growth, adjusted full year 
2010 earnings per share would be 35.3c, according to Davy Rsearch. "There really should be no great surprise in 
this news given the annual jump which has occurred in global dairy product prices," said Davy's analyst, John 
O'Reilly. Shares in Glanbia dropped 16c to E2.92. United Drug delivered a solid set of first-half numbers that leave 
ISEQ rebound hit by State debt fears ISEQ Falls
brokers comfortable that full-year forecasts (earnings per share of 23c) can be met. Revenues (E853.3m) and 
adjusted EBITA (E35m) were flat year-on-year, and lower interest expense allowed adjusted PBT to grow by 5pc to 
E31.5m. Adjusted earnings per share rose by 0.5pc to 10.68c. Foreign exchange was a 2pc drag on results. Cash 
flow was strong - the E22.3m reduction in net debt already brings UDG to Davy's forecast for the full year. Shares in 
the firm fell 5c to E2.55. Shares in Ryanair fell 13c to E3.35 after its smaller UK rival, easyJet reported total revenue 
per seat that grew by 5.1pc (and by 0.8pc at constant currency), driven by good consumer demand, ancillary 
revenue growth and a 1.4pc increase in sector length. The underlying pre-tax loss of £78.7m was slightly better 
than the recent company guidance (Davy: -87.3m, albeit on April 19th the company had guided the top end of 
previous £80-95m guidance). Aer Lingus stocks fell by 4c to E0.67.

The impressive rebound on the Dublin shares market took a severe knock this morning as global investors 
abandoned initial euphoria over the ECB's E750bn rescue packaged and fretted over the ability of some eurozone 
States to rein in deficits.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 75.49 points to 3,141.78.
European equity markets increased strongly on Monday, registering their biggest one-day percentage rise in 17 
months, on the back of the weekend announcement of a support package from the ECB. The package consists of 
E750bn in loans and guarantees for euro-zone governments together with the promise that the ECB will intervene 
in government bond markets. But today was a different story as some investors doubted whether there is the 
political will in some eurozone States to bring in the kind of stringent cutting of spending needed to slash their huge 
budgetary deficits. "The developments politically could potentially undermine the markets in the short term," said 
Tim Whitehead, portfolio manager at Redmayne Bentley. "The realisation that the euro package put together over 
the weekend is not a panacea is beginning to dawn as well. And now, potentially, China is perhaps looking to rein in 
growth even further."
Shares in Dublin's listed banks - big gainers on Monday - were big fallers this morning with AIB down 10c to E1.28, 
Bank of Ireland dropped 5c to E1.63 and Irish Life and Permanent lost 13c to E2.59. Led by a significant year-on-
year improvement in Irish dairy ingredients performance, Glanbia expects a strong first-half profits recovery and for 
this to carry through into mid-teen earnings growth for 2010. On the assumption of 15pc growth, adjusted full year

Shares slipped in Dublin this morning in line with markets abroad as investors showed renewed doubts about the 
efficacy of this week's E750m euro rescue.
After big gains in Europe yesterday, and on Wall St last last, new doubts set in on Asian markets overnight.
And these have continued into the European session this morning.
The ISEQ index was down 39.59 points a short time ago at 3,177.68. The market's fears centre on whether Greece 
will be able to cut spending and increase taxes enough to meet its deficit reduction targets. In Dublin this morning, 
banks are all down. AIB and Bank of Ireland have both slipped by 6c to 132 and 162 respectively, while Irish Life 
and Permanent is off by 8c to 263. United Drug has dipped by 2c to 258, despite posting a 5pc rise in profits this 
morning and taking a bullish stance on prospects. Glanbia is down 3c to 305 after a similarly upbeat management 
statement, but after farmers yesterday's rejected the spin off of its Irish operations. CRH is down 29c to 1986, with 
Smurfit Kappa off by 5c to 718 and Ryanair has dipped 4c to 344. DCC has bucked the trend, with a gain of 5c to 
1860.

Body
Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today welcomed a Spanish court's decision in Girona and Madrid which, it said, 
confirmed that Ryanair complies with EU261 regulation and that passengers are not entitled to compensation.
The Girona court dismissed a passenger's claim for E1,700 "compensation" after Ryanair amended the departure 
time of his flight, because Ryanair had properly notified the passengers of this schedule change.
The Madrid court dismissed a case in which a passenger claimed that Ryanair had closed check-in for their flight 
early, preventing them from boarding, when Ryanair presented proof that the check-in desk had remained open but 
that the passengers had simply arrived late.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "We welcome the decisions of the Spanish courts which confirm that Ryanair 
complies with the EU261 regulation and that passengers are not entitled to make claims for compensation in cases 
of routine flight changes or if passengers arrive late for their flights. We hope that these decisions will prevent other 
baseless and misguided claims against Ryanair."

The ISEQ index of Irish shares staged a dramatic 230-plus-point rebound from last week's rout as markets around 
the world welcomed the ECB's announcement of a E750 billion rescue package designed to avert a sovereign debt 
disaster.
After their worst weekly drop in nearly 18 months, stock markets around Europe rebounded in spectacular fashion 
after Sunday night's rescue package to stabilise the euro agreed by global policymakers, boosting investor 
sentiment. Dublin-based brokers' analysts welcomed the ECB's E750 billion package to stabilise the chaotic 
sovereign debt market, saying that Europe "pressed the nuclear button" in the face of a near catastrophe. Early this 
morning, EU institutions delivered their systemic response to a systemic crisis. A backstop loan package of E750bn 
for vulnerable sovereigns, fashioned by Art. 122.2 of the Lisbon Treaty, and involving direct contributions from the 
EU budget and the IMF, will be instigated. Most symbolically, the ECB will "conduct interventions in the euro area 
public and private debt securities markets to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are 
dysfunctional".
Banks were the biggest gainers with AIB up 27c to E1.38, Bank of Ireland jumped 25c to E1.67 and Irish Life and 
Permanent climbed 40c to E2.69.
Bank of Ireland this morning gave more details on a proposal to raise E3.4 billion in equity Tier 1 capital through 
institutional investors and a rights issue. It said the fully underwritten proposals will see a minimum of E3.421 billion 
Equity Tier 1 Capital comprise a firm Institutional Placing of E0.5 billion, a firm placing to the State of E1.036 billion 
and a Rights Issue of up to E1.885 billion. Elsewhere, shares in Aer Lingus rose 2c to E0.68 after it said passenger 
numbers fell by 27pc last month to 689,000, under the impact the ash cloud from Iceland's volcano. The airline says 
its operations were hit by the closure of Irish, UK and some continental airspace due to the ash cloud from the

Eyjafjallajoekull volcano. Ryanair's stocks climbed 12c to E3.49. The frozen baked products division of Ralcorp 
Holdings - whose activities include par-baked bread, cookies and biscuits in competition with Ireland's Aryzta - is 
recording wide margin swings this year. In the first quarter, the operating margin in the division almost doubled 
year-on-year to 14.5pc. While the margin in the second quarter still showed a 270 basis point (bps) rise annually, it 
was 400bps lower than in the first three months of its financial year. Shares in Aryzta surged by 87c a piece to 
E27.95. CRH also did a great deal - being the largest stock on the index by market cap - to lift the ISEQ, 
rebounding by E2.40 a share to E20.15 as the markets digested the ECB rescue package for sovereign debt in a 
crisis that had already spilled over in to corporate bond confidence. The latest data from the Builders Merchant 
Federation show that UK merchanting volumes declined by -3.4pc annually in March, which compares to +1.1pc in 
February and -13.7pc in weather affected January. This would appear to be at odds with commentary from the 
larger peers, the latest being Grafton who reported that its UK business has seen growth in each of the last three 
months. Grafton's shares climbed 15c to E3.45.

The Irish arm of international digital sales agency Ad2onegroup.
com is promising a range of new access points to firms hoping to target the female consumer market.
The agency is offering immediate access to the online versions of Hello! and Marie Claire magazines, the Daily Mail 
and People.com.
Roddy Walshe, spokesman for the group in Ireland, said Irish brands which found it difficult to target this sought-
after consumer sector could now reach up to 500,000 women in the 18-45 market.
''It is now possible to advertise directly to unique Irish visitors on these sites. Other major websites which are 
represented byAd2One and can be tapped into by Irish advertisers include Ryanair, the Guardian, MySpace.com, 
the Wall Street Journal, eBay, LinkedIn and the Disney Channel."
Walshe said the traditional advertising routes that had been used to target the so called 'housewives' market were 
drying up, due largely to the increasing consumption of internet-based content.
He added that 70 per cent of women in Ireland aged between 18 and 35 shopped online for clothes, make-up and 
other goods. ''While the majority of display advertising spending will go to the big publishers such as newspapers' 
websites, a growing share of the market is going to companies such as Ad2one, a one stop shop which coordinates 
an online media advertising campaign, to help advertisers place their ad on a range of sites - from specialist 
branded sites to mass-market."

(RTTNews) - A fresh aerial lockdown resulting from volcanic dust thrown up by the Icelandic volcano which 
paralyzed European flights last month could cause further disruption to the continent&apos;s airline services, British 
meteorologists warned Sunday.
Following the latest threat from Eyjafjallajokull volcano, most of northern Italy&apos;s airports have been closed 
until at least midday while those in neighboring France, Switzerland, and northern areas of Portugal too may be 
affected.
According to UK&apos;s Met Office the ash could return to the country&apos;s airspace on Sunday and may 
continue into next week and six airports in Scotland have been closed to air traffic until One O&apos;clock in the 
afternoon with flights to Portugal, France and Spain grounded by authorities Saturday.
European aviation agency Eurocontrol said Pisa and Florence airports in Italy will be closed between 12:30 noon 
and 6:30 in the evening (local time) while Santiago, La Coruna and Vigo in Spain will be shut until 3:30 in the 
evening,Sunday.
In a worst-case scenario the aerial lockdown could continue well into next week if the northerly winds bring ash over 
western Scotland and Ireland and passengers are now being asked to check flight details before embarking on 
travel.
Meanwhile, Easyjet one of Britain&apos;s two biggest airlines warned of possible disruption to Sunday&apos;s 
flights over Switzerland, southern and central France, northern Italy and northern Portugal while Irish airline Ryanair 
canceled flights to and from Porto and Milan Bergamo.
On Saturday Ryanair canceled flights to and from destinations including Spain and the Canary Islands, Portugal 
and France and 22 of its flights as well as three Easyjet services.
There are signs that Eyjafjallajokull&apos;s volcanic activity has increased lately and volcanologists said it was 
sending ash up to heights of 30,000 ft (9,100m).

Revenue mounts Supreme Court action over tax scheme

The Revenue Commissioners have taken a Supreme Court challenge over a tax scheme used by the wife of 
businessman Shane Ryan to minimise tax on the sale of shares.
The Revenue is appealing a decision of the High Court in the case involving Lorraine Kinsella, the wife of Shane 
Ryan, a son of the late Ryanair founder, Tony Ryan. The case was mentioned in the Supreme Court last Friday. 
Kinsella sold  19 million worth of Ryanair shares in 2003, but paid less than  40,000 in tax in Italy, where she was 
tax resident. By being tax resident there, she avoided paying any Irish capital gains tax (CGT).
Kinsella took a High Court action against the Revenue three years ago, in an effort to prove that she was not liable 
to pay CGT on the proceeds of the share sale, due to her Italian residence.
In the High Court case, she claimed that, one year before she sold the shares, accountancy firm KPMG had 
contacted the Revenue on order to get confirmation that a 1971 tax convention between Ireland and Italy applied to 
Irish CGT.
The Revenue disputed her claim, and threatened to raise an assessment of her tax liability in relation to outstanding 
CGT.
The High Court ruled that the scheme used by Kinsella was legal and she was not liable for tax. The Revenue has 
now challenged that ruling. At the time of the High Court ruling, Mr Justice Peter Kelly noted that Kinsella had 
entered into a letting agreement for a ''tiny apartment'' in Rome in June 20 03. Three months later, she bought 
shares in Ryanair from her husband for  18 million.
No money changed hands because the purchase was funded by a loan from Ryan secured on the shares. Because 
it was a sales transaction between spouses, there was no CGT liability.
Kinsella sold the shares in October 2003 for more than  19 million.
Revenue mounts Supreme Court action over tax scheme
She filed a tax return in Italy declaring a gain of  314,638, giving rise to a tax liability of less than  40,000, which she 
paid.

Good news for airlines on compensation claims

Airlines facing big compensation bills for ash cloud disruption are studying a decision by the Court of Justice of the 
European Union (CJEU) last week on passenger compensation limits.
The Luxembourg court said compensation should not impose ''a very heavy burden of damages on air carriers, 
which would be difficult to determine and to calculate, and which would be liable to undermine, and even paralyse, 
the economic activity of those carriers''.
Last month, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said his airline would continue to try to persuade the 
European Commission and European Parliament to limit reimbursement claims for passengers stranded due to the 
volcanic eruption.
Originally, O'Leary said he would go to court rather than refund the cost of meals and hotel accommodation.
Ryanair has long argued that reimbursements under passenger rights legislation should be limited to the cost of the 
ticket, as they are for train, coach and ferry operators. O'Leary said the situation was ''absurd'' and said there was 
''no legislation designed that says any airline getting a fare of  30 should be reimbursing passengers many 
thousands of euro for hotel accommodation''.
There are already limits on compensation for damage to luggage. Under the Montreal Convention, the liability of an 
EU airline for damage or delay to passengers' baggage is normally limited to 1,000 so-called special drawing rights 
(SDRs), equivalent to about  1,135.
In 2008, businessman Axel Walz claimed damages from airline Clickair for the loss of checked baggage on a flight 
from Barcelona in Spain to Porto in Portugal. Walz claimed  2,700 for the lost baggage and  500 for resulting 
damage.
The Barcelona Commercial Court asked the CJEU whether the Montreal Convention limit covered material and 
non-material loss, or whether 1,000 SDRs could be claimed for each.
Good news for airlines on compensation claims
Last Wednesday, the court ruled that the system of strict liability for air carriers required an ''equitable balance of 
interests'' between carriers and passengers, so there should be clear limits on compensation, regardless of the 
nature of the damage caused to a passenger.
It ruled that the  1,135 liability of air carriers for loss of baggage was an absolute maximum, and included material 
and nonmaterial damage. Vincent Power, an EU competition lawyer with A&L Goodbody in Dublin, said the 
judgment was ''good news for airlines, but not such good news for passengers''.
''Last Wednesday's judgment was not accidental - the court knew what it was doing," Power said. ''The reference to 
undermining the 'economic activity' of carriers is more significant, because it followed the Icelandic ash crisis.
''Whether the court would apply the same principle to the EU Passenger Compensation Directive is not yet clear. If 
the court wanted to cap liability under the directive, it now has the tools available - the finding in this case, the 
general prohibition on unjust enrichment and legal principles such as 'a fundamental change of circumstances 
alters everything'," said Power.

A torrid time for tourism

Airlines and holiday firms are bracing themselves for a summer of uncertainty as Iceland's volcano continues to 
spew out ash in bigger volumes and to greater heights.
Just two weeks after a six day shutdown of most of Europe's airspace, winds carried the ash back over Ireland last 
week, causing widespread disruption of flights. By last Friday afternoon, the ash cloud over the Atlantic from the 
Eyjafjallajokull volcano was 1,000 miles long and 800 miles wide - and showed no sign of dispersing.
Yesterday, flights to many airports in Spain and Portugal were closed because of the movement of ash cloud. The 
Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) also warned of possible further cancellations to other southern Europe destinations.
Each day of disruption has cost the Irish travel and tourism sector about  20 million - about  11 million for Ryanair 
and Aer Lingus, and  9million in lost tourism revenues.
Some industry analysts fear that continuing uncertainty could deter people from booking overseas holidays. Tanya 
Airey, managing director of Irishowned tour operator Sunway, said she hoped southwesterly winds would prevail 
during the key summer months, keeping the ash cloud away and Ireland's airspace open.
''The situation is most unusual and cannot continue. When the airports close, reservations are very quiet," she said.
''But they generally pick up again once the situation changes. A certain number of people may deflect to home 
holidays or to ferries, but others will think, 'To hell with it, you've got to live life'. People still want to escape the rain 
and depression."
Airey said she was optimistic the disruption might force people back to package holidays, which were bonded and 
guaranteed, rather than risk losing everything on self booked DIY holidays.
A torrid time for tourism
''After the first episode, we got a huge number of e-mails and thank-you cards from holiday makers for putting them 
up - an extra week, in some cases. People who booked their own accommodation and flights had no comeback," 
she said.
''We're hoping the situation will make the cake a little larger for travel operators now." Airey said Sunway was 
almost fully booked this weekend, and travellers could ''rest assured they will be looked after'' in the event of any 
disruption.
John Concannon, market development director of Fáilte Ireland, said the impact of the ash cloud on incoming 
tourism ''cannot be sugar-coated''.
Thousands of visitors and millions of euro in revenues were lost as the situation unfolded in recent weeks.
''Two weeks ago, when the problem first arose, places such as Galway, Kilkenny and Killarney saw a boost in trade, 
as people planning to jet away for the weekend took a break locally. However, the likes of Dublin as a destination 
has suffered - and will suffer - seriously as a result of the potentially ongoing problem," said Concannon.
On the plus side, Fáilte Ireland hoped for a bounce in home holidays - or 'staycations' - among Irish people who opt 
not to travel abroad.
''Where kids or older people come into the situation, then home holidays are likely to be more attractive this year," 
said Concannon. He said weekend breaks to popular Irish destinations had increased recently, and the agency 
hoped for an overall increase in domestic breaks.
The number of domestic breaks was relatively unchanged at 8.34 million last year, according to the Central 
Statistics Office, while the number of overseas trips dropped from around eight million to 7.2 million.
''Irish breaks make up about 53 per cent of all trips. If that can be increased to 54-55 per cent this year, it would be 
great," said Concannon.
''Prices for accommodation are down an average of 17 per cent in Ireland, compared with two years ago." The ash 
cloud has also had a silver lining for ferry operators. Stena Line experienced a 300 per cent increase in foot 
passengers and a 50 per cent increase in cars using its sailings between four ports in Ireland and Britain.
Stena spokesman Eamon Hewitt said that, as people ''strive for certainty'', they were increasingly viewing ferries as 
a dependable option.
''Last Monday night and Tuesday morning, we had 300 extra bookings," said Hewitt.
''We have good capacity on 17 return sailings a day from Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Belfast and Rosslare, so the 
options are there for people."
He said that the ferry company was ''expecting a lot of converts from air travel by the end of the summer'' if the ash 
anti-cloud disruption continued.
''A lot of passengers are surprised by the luxury of ferries if they have not been on one for quite a while. We are not 
increasing prices and there are no questions about luggage, liquid or security searches."
Irish Ferries, which provides sailings to France as well as Britain, last week launched a new online advertising 
campaign and expects to benefit from the volcanic ash situation over the summer.
Irish Ferries spokesman Don Hall said he also expected a spike in ferry travellers. ''Ferries are not what people 
remember ; they provide lounges, five-star cabins, bistros and restaurants. Our summer sailings to France - which 
we expect will become more popular now - even have a cabaret performances, cinema and bars.
We believe we will attract new and return customers in coming weeks and months," he said.

(RTTNews) - Several European countries are facing disruption in air traffic on Saturday following a fresh volcanic 
eruption in Iceland, media reported. A new plume of ash emitted by the Eyjafjoell volcano has forced trans-Atlantic 
flights to reroute as the ash cloud rose into some of the region&apos;s most crowded airspace.
Spain&apos;s airport and air traffic authority Aena reportedly said that Spain closed 16 airports and they would 
remain closed until at least 6 p.m. local time on Saturday because of the ash cloud.
According to Spain&apos;s Transport Minister Jose Blanco, airports in the northeast, including the key hub of 
Barcelona, are likely to be closed from 1200 GMT. Other affected airports would include Gerona, Tarragon and 
Reus. Blanco reportedly stated that some 20 airports in all could be closed until midnight GMT.
Citing airport officials and websites, reports said that in Portugal, 104 flights serving Lisbon, Oporto and Faro were 
canceled on Saturday. Portuguese air traffic control reportedly said the restrictions would be lifted gradually from 
1200 GMT.
The national weather service of France has warned that the ash cloud would be covering the southern part of the 
country by late Saturday, with concentrations rising to 6,000 metres (20,000 feet). The French authority is not sure if 
the ash cloud would disperse before the opening of Wednesday&apos;s Cannes film festival for which several 
private jets are expected to reach Riviera airports.
Low-cost carrier Ryanair, which uses Marseille airport as the main French hub, reportedly said that the 
company&apos;s flights from 1400 GMT had been canceled, plus two services to Lisbon, making a total of 15 
flights. Meanwhile, BBC News said that flights from the Stansted airport to Spain and Portugal were canceled 
because of the volcanic ash cloud.
Overnight trans-Atlantic flights have seen delays of up to three hours as aircraft were rerouted north and south of 
buffer zones established around the plume. Westbound trans-Atlantic flights, including to and from major hubs such 
as London Heathrow also faced delays, reports stated.
The volcano that began erupting on April 14 had caused several European nations to close airspaces for a week, 
leading to travel disruption for thousands of passengers.

Atlantic ash cloud forcing US -Europe flights south

A mammoth cloud of volcanic ash is stretching 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) across the North Atlantic and forcing 
aircraft to divert south into a long-haul traffic jam, Irish and European air authorities said Friday.
Forecasters warned that the rapidly spreading cloud of ash from Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano was projected to 
reach southern Greenland and the northwest tip of Spain by Saturday.
They stressed that the aviation obstacle does not pose any immediate threat to shut airports or ground aircraft once 
again, but is forcing trans-Atlantic jets to divert into increasingly clogged air corridors. Most are diverting south into 
Spanish air space but, as that route suffers jams and the cloud grows closer, more flights are facing diversions 
north into the Arctic.
In Brussels, the European air-traffic management agency Eurocontrol said flight control centers on both sides of the 
Atlantic were drafting new routes for aircraft that would add one to two hours to the times required to cross the 
ocean. Eurocontrol advised aircraft to carry extra fuel.
Ireland, which has borne the brunt of this week's renewed invasion of Icelandic ash into European air space, shut 
down but then rapidly reopened six western airports Friday as the cloud remained sufficiently west of its Atlantic 
coastline.
Ireland and Scotland also suffered airport shutdowns Tuesday and Wednesday. They were the first such closures 
since a majority of European air links were shut down April 14-20, stranding 10 million passengers.
The Irish government's emergency task force on the ash crisis said the cloud already measured 2,000 kilometers by 
1,300 kilometers (1,250 miles by 800 miles) and was being pushed by winds both northwest and southeast.
The Irish Aviation Authority produced interactive maps illustrating how the cloud should grow even larger, running 
from Greenland to Spain, within the next 24 hours. It said Irish flights to and from the United States should operate 
Saturday but would suffer delays because of the particularly circuitous routes required.
Atlantic ash cloud forcing US -Europe flights south
Ireland's two major airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, shifted services to Dublin Airport in the east and Cork Airport 
in the southwest during Friday's early-morning shutdowns of other Irish airports. Uncertain how long Shannon 
Airport in western Ireland would be shut, Aer Lingus opted to bus hundreds of U.S.-bound Aer Lingus passengers 
four hours east to fly from Dublin instead.
Eurocontrol said trans-Atlantic airlines could no longer safely fly over the Atlantic ash cloud because it has climbed 
to 35,000 feet (10,500 meters) and into the typical cruising altitude of aircraft. Until recent days, the ash had 
remained below 20,000 feet (6,000 meters).
Eurocontrol said as the ash cloud has expanded southward, it has squeezed the air space available to trans-
Atlantic flights, creating a traffic jam in Spanish air space.
"Flights are having to be rerouted south of the no-fly zone, which means there are many more aircraft passing 
through the Spanish air traffic control sectors, rather than taking the usual routes over Ireland," said Eurocontrol 
spokeswoman Kyla Evans.
Until Eyjafjallajokul stops its emissions, the key to the future course of Europe's ash crisis will be the prevailing 
Atlantic winds.
When the winds blow to the northeast toward the unpopulated Arctic typical in springtime the danger to aircraft is 
minimized. But when they shift southward, as happened both this week and in mid-April, airlines' ability to land and 
depart safely can be jeopardized.
The glacier-capped volcano, about 900 miles (1,500 kilometers) northwest of Ireland, has shown no signs of 
stopping since it began belching ash April 13. It last erupted from 1821 to 1823.

Ireland reopened its western airports Friday but warned that a 1,000-mile-long (1,600-kilometer-long) cloud of 
volcanic ash from Iceland was still lurking offshore.
The Irish Aviation Authority, which ordered a half-dozen airports shut overnight, quickly reopened them once it 
became clear that the cloud was staying sufficiently far from Ireland's Atlantic coast at least until the winds shift 
once again.
"While the northerly winds are keeping the bulk of the cloud out in the Atlantic, the increased size of the cloud 
continues to pose a risk especially if the winds change," the authority said in a statement.
"The restrictions were required as the increased level of recent volcanic activity has created a massive ash cloud 
stretching 1,000 miles long and 700 miles wide," it said.
Ireland's two major airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, shifted services to Dublin Airport in the east and Cork Airport 
in the southwest during the early-morning shutdowns of other airports. Uncertain how long Shannon Airport in 
western Ireland would be shut, Aer Lingus opted to bus hundreds of U.S.-bound Aer Lingus passengers four hours 
east to fly from Dublin instead.
The Irish Aviation Authority said shifting winds, most recently coming from the north, had bundled recent days' 
erupted ash into a mammoth cloud that is growing both in width and height by the hour.
Eurocontrol, a Brussels agency that determines the air routes that airliners use across the continent, said the ash 
accumulation posed a new navigational obstacle because the cloud is gradually climbing to 35,000 feet (10,500 
meters) and into the typical cruising altitude of trans-Atlantic aircraft. Until recent days, the ash had remained below 
20,000 feet (6,000 meters).
Eurcontrol said as the ash cloud has expanded southward, it has squeezed the air space available to trans-Atlantic 
flights, creating a traffic jam in Spanish air space.
Irish airports reopen despite Atlantic ash cloud
Eurocontrol warned airliners detouring along the southern edge of the spreading cloud to expect delays of up to 100 
minutes.
"Flights are having to be rerouted south of the no-fly zone, which means there are many more aircraft passing 
through the Spanish air traffic control sectors, rather than taking the usual routes over Ireland," said Eurocontrol 
spokeswoman Kyla Evans.
Until Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano stops its emissions, the key to the future course of Europe's ash crisis will be

stopping since it began belching ash April 13. It last erupted from 1821 to 1823.
In Iceland, civil protection official Agust Gunnar Gylfason said the eruption intensified Wednesday and the volcano 
continued to emit a higher volume of ash Thursday. He said the ash plume's maximum altitude was oscillating 
between 20,000 and 30,000 feet (6,000 and 9,000 meters).

BA faces renewed threat of strike after fall in trade

Highlight: Union set to reveal results of fresh vote
Warning of anger over sacking
Body
British Airways is facing the threat of more industrial action as the union representing cabin crew prepares to 
announce today the results of a fresh ballot in the long-running dispute.
The move comes a day after BA dismissed Duncan Holley, a flight attendant and union official who has worked at 
the airline for more than 30 years, in what he called a "ruthless" new approach by management to industrial 
relations.
Separately, BA reported one of the most serious falls in monthly passenger figures for a decade, after its fleet was 
grounded for almost a week in April by the volcanic ash cloud. The number of passengers carried by the loss-
making airline fell to just more than 2m worldwide last month - a 24 per cent drop from the same month last year.
Ryanair, which reports passenger bookings rather than actual numbers of people carried, said it had 6.2m bookings 
in April - a 17 per cent increase over the same month in 2009 - but added that 1.2m of those passengers had their 
flights cancelled after the volcanic eruption in Iceland.
The sharp falls at BA come only weeks after the airline reported a 15 per cent monthly drop in passenger numbers 
in March, when thousands of its cabin crew staged two walkouts in the dispute over pay and staffing levels that has 
lasted for more than a year.
About 12,000 cabin crew have been balloted by the Unite union over the past week on a new offer from the airline.
Unite leaders, representing BA cabin crew, have conceded that the new offer is an improvement on past ones but 
have urged their members to reject it because of what they say is BA's "vindictive" treatment of employees 
supporting the strikes - some of whom have lost discounted travel benefits or face disciplinary charges. Several 
have been dismissed.
BA faces renewed threat of strike after fall in trade
One union official said voting patterns so far in the online ballot suggested that the membership would reject the 
new offer.
Another official said that, depending on the strength of the vote and turnout, a fresh set of strike dates could be 
announced over the next few days.
Both agreed that the union faced a limited period in which to call the kind of prolonged strike action that some union 
officials would now like to see. That is because BA can legally take tougher action against striking workers, 
including dismissals, 12 weeks after the first round of stoppages, which began on March 20.
"I can't for one minute see BA sacking people before that 12-week deadline has expired," said Marc Meryon, a 
partner at the Bircham Dyson Bell law firm, who specialises in industrial law. To do so would be to invite claims for 
unfair dismissal.
Mr Meryon said sacking people after the deadline could still be complex and time-consuming and that the airline 
may want to consider other penalties.
He said the dismissal of Duncan Holley, branch secretary of the British Airways Stewards and Stewardesses 
Association, the Unite division that represents BA cabin crew, could inflame tensions in the dispute. "Sacking a 
union representative is about the worst thing that can happen," he said.
Mr Holley said he was sacked after BA departed from previous practice and refused to allow him to go off normal 
work rosters to carry out union duties last December.
BA refused to comment on his specific case but a spokeswoman said: "The company's disciplinary process has 
been in place for many years and has been agreed with all of the airline's recognised trade unions, including Unite."
