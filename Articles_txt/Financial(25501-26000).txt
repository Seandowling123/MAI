Counsel for the Irish government will today oppose an effort by Ryanair to get an EU ban on its right to bid for Aer 
Lingus lifted.
The low cost airline is seeking, in a case that starts today, to have the 2007 ruling by the European Commission 
reversed.
The case, being heard in the European Court, will consider the ruling, which was issued during Ryanair's first 
attempt to take over the former state airline.
A legal team from the state solicitor's office will represent the government at today's hearing. Aer Lingus will be 
represented separately. If the court upholds the original Commission ruling, any further bid by Ryanair for Aer 
Lingus will become next-to-near impossible.

The battle between Ryanair and Aer Lingus for control of the former state airline will move to Luxembourg this week 
when the Court of First Instance (CFI) will hear applications by both airlines in separate cases.
In 2006, Ryanair acquired a 19.16 per cent stake in Aer Lingus following its privatisation by the government.
On October 23, 2006, Ryanair launched a public bid for the entire share capital of the former state airline.
One week later, it notified the European Commission of the proposed acquisition, as required by the community 
merger regulation.
During the bid period, Ryanair acquired further shares and, by November 2006, held 25.17 per cent of the Aer 
Lingus share capital.
In June 2007, the commission declared that the acquisition was incompatible with the common market. But 
following that decision, Michael O'Leary's airline acquired further shares, bringing its total shareholding to 29.4 per 
cent. Ryanair will challenge the commission's decision before the CFI tomorrow.
During and after the procedure that led to the commission's decision, Aer Lingus asked it to order Ryanair to give 
up its shareholding but, in October 2007, the commission refused the request.
It said the merger regulation did not give the commission power to make such an order, as Ryanair had not 
implemented its intended acquisition and it had only a minority shareholding, which did not allow it to exercise 
control over Aer Lingus.
In November 2007, Aer Lingus lodged an action for annulment of that decision, and that case will be heard on 
Tuesday.

It has emerged that the state's accounting watchdog sought additional information regarding the accounts of 11 
leading publicly-quoted companies, including CRH, Ryanair and several banks.
The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) reviewed the accounts of 13 leading Irish publicly 
quoted companies last year.
Of the 13 companies reviewed, the authority raised issues with the directors of 11 companies. The 11 companies 
with which the authority corresponded were Bank of Ireland, Ryanair, C&C, DCC, Oglesby and Butler, AIB, Anglo 
Irish Bank, CRH, IAWS, Kingspan And Waterford Wedgwood.
C&C Group and DCC were the subject of both a full review and a follow-up by the authority.
The follow-up is designed to assess whether undertakings provided by directors on foot of previous reviews have 
been fulfilled in subsequent reports. The fact that issues have been raised with an issuer's directors did not 
necessarily indicate non-compliance with the relevant accounting rules, IAASA stressed.
Companies selected for review are chosen using a risk-based approach supplemented by cyclical and random 
selections.
The authority was established in 2003,with the aim of enhancing public confidence in financial reporting by policing 
the financial reporting practices of issuers that sell equity, debt and funds.
More than half of issuers whose accounts were scrutinised by the watchdog subsequently published amended 
financial reports, suggesting issuers and their auditors still had some way to go towards full compliance with 
reporting standards.
Of 51 issuers reviewed, 28 volunteered to publish amended financial statements after the watchdog queried their 
accounts. Of these, only one was an issuer of equity.
Accounting body queried 11 large plcs
The authority found that funds and debt issuers had the greatest need to improve the standard of their statutory 
financial reporting. Many of the debt and fund issuers reviewed would not be household names, and might not 
necessarily be selling a product in the Irish market.
Among the issues highlighted in IAASA's annual report on its website last week was the failure to disclose related 
party transactions, matters concerning the accounting treatment of taxes and matters concerning the accounting 
treatment of investments in associates.

Europe's smaller companies punch above their weight

Liquidity concerns deter some investors, but small caps have delivered big returns, writes Ellen Kelleher
Body
European small-cap stocks are often ignored as they can be difficult to sell in a downturn, but being overlooked can 
be helpful for investors looking for long-term returns in the sector.
Around 3,000 to 4,000 companies with a market capitalisation of less than EUR3.5bn (£3bn) are listed on 
continental European exchanges. And because analysts often fail to assess their prospects with vigour, some 
attract scant attention. As a result, their valuations tend to be reasonable.
"Inefficiencies in the small-cap market have been increasing for some time as fewer and fewer analysts have been 
deployed to cover this area," says Nick Williams, manager of Baring's £214.1m European Select trust.
"And despite market volatility, a significant proportion of Europe's smaller companies have come out with results 
that have exceeded overly-negative expectations. There may be some profit-taking in the near-term but we think 
there are some excellent long-term opportunities."
Since January, the European small-cap sector has enjoyed a strong run, reporting a 19 per cent return against a 
gain of 1.3 per cent by the wider European market, according to Morningstar.
UK-listed European small-cap funds are up 9.8 per cent on average over the period - with particularly robust 
performances recorded by Baillie Gifford European Small cap fund (up 21.1 per cent); Ignis's European smaller 
companies fund (+15.49 per cent); and Insight Investment's European smaller companies fund (up 16.8 per cent).
Favoured holdings vary widely by industry, country and popularity and range from Turkish Airlines to Irish Life and 
Permanent,   Ryanair, Wire Card, a German online payments group, and Jumbo, the Greek toy retailer.
Liquidity poses concern. While outperformance is more likely to be achieved by the sector, so too is 
underperformance. Looking for protection against balance sheet erosion and sharp share price falls, a number of 
small-cap managers choose to keep large, diversified portfolios of, say, 90 to 110 stocks.
Europe's smaller companies punch above their weight
"Smaller companies are more vulnerable to events than larger ones," reports Andy Lynch, who heads Schroders' 
European dynamic growth fund, which has a 20 per cent allocation to small caps.
"If the CEO of Vodafone gets run over by a bus, a strong management team will be able to step up and continue 
the company's successful path, but management changes and other business problems are more difficult at a 
smaller company."
Lynch is overweight in healthcare, energy and utilities, but also holds stakes in Azimut, the Italian fund management 
group, Rosenbauer, the Austrian fireengine maker with a "sound balance sheet", as well as Acino, the Swiss drug 
maker.
He chooses not to hedge against sterling's rise against the euro though his currency exposure extends to the euro, 
Swiss franc, Norwegian and Danish krone and Swedish krona. "I found my ability to forecast currency movements 
is atrocious, so I just don't worry about it," he says.
Philip Dicken, who oversees both Threadneedle's pan-European £115m small- cap fund and its £570m small-cap 
European fund which excludes UK holdings, claims that UK small caps hold appeal as they tend to be more liquid 
than European stocks.
When investing in Europe, Dicken prefers industrial groups with considerable market share to financials. "Barriers 
to entry give companies pricing power," he explains. Two German picks are the optician Fielmann and Stratec 
Biomedical. "Fielmann has about 50 per cent of the market share for the sale of glasses and contact lenses in 
Germany, but they are the lowest-cost provider. It's a well-managed company," he points out.
A bout of overselling has narrowed the gap between the valuations of the continent's large and small caps and 
some fund managers running money across the wider European market have not restocked their portfolios with 
small caps since 2007 when holdings of smaller companies were slashed as they grew more expensive. Concerned 
about liquidity, just four of the 50 stocks in the portfolio of Kevin Lilley - manager of Royal London's European 
growth trust are small caps, for example.
"When I'm very positive, I have 20 to 25 per cent of my fund in small caps. I'd rather have a large proportion in large 
caps because with small caps, you have a liquidity issue. If I try to sell a similar size position in small caps, it can 
take a week," Lilley reports.
But given the recent poor performance of European large caps, views on the appropriate spread between the 
continent's bantam and heavyweight classes vary. The 15 per cent fall in the value of the euro against sterling hit 
investment trusts sharply in the first six months of the year. And a number of those invested in European large caps 
performed poorly. Among those reporting the worst falls were Gartmore European (which lost 15 per cent), 
BlackRock's Greater Europe trust (down 13 per cent) and Fidelity's European Values (off 10 per cent), according to 
Oriel Securities.
By comparison, the performance of small caps was far better. Defying the expectations of analysts who predicted 
Europe's small-cap sector would underperform in the first quarter, a number of companies reported results that 
exceeded estimates, according to Williams of Baring. This performance, coupled with the dearth of research by 
analysts, throws up opportunities for patient stockpickers who are willing to sift through the market.
"Institutional buyers often take a more cautious approach to liquidity than they need to," concludes Williams.

Banks and Elan shares led the Dublin market lower this morning as investors saw little to cheer in the latest batch 
of economic data.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 14.18 points to 2,691.90.
Shares in AIB edged up 3c to E1.75 but Bank of Ireland declined by 2c to E1.67 and Irish Life and Permanent lost 
13c to E3.50 amid very mixed signals in the latest global economic indicators and after the Irish Live Register 
figures, while showing some hints of bottoming out, remain grim.
Irish private sector credit (PSC) fell again in May, its third consecutive month-on-month (mom) decline. May's 
decline of almost E1bn (0.3pc on the month) compared with a fall of E1.8bn in April and brings the year-on-year 
growth rate down to 0.8pc. As we said in our weekly market comment on June 29th, a continuation of this trend 
could leave us at around minus 6pc by year-end. More European stock markets rose this morning as energy stocks 
drew strength from higher oil prices. London's FTSE started the third quarter of the year on a positive note, gaining 
63 points (1.5pc) to stand at 4,313 by 11am. The Paris CAC added 54 points (1.7pc) to 3,194 while the Frankfurt 
DAX was up 70 points (1.5pc) to 4,878. Higher oil prices were of little use to investors in Irish shares. However, 
Ryanair stocks gained 4c to E3.30 while Aer Lingus was flat at E0.50. Shares in Elan fell by 22c to E4.65 amid 
speculation that Swiss drugmaker Novartis was in talks to buy components of the company. Confirmation of a 10th 
case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) from patients using its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, 
which is marketed with Biogen Idec, weighed on the stock. With over 40,000 patients on Tysabri the rate of PML, at 
one in 4,000, remains well below the FDA's limit of one in 1,000. Biogen Idec and UCB have terminated a potential 
MS treatment known as CDP323 after its Phase II trial results did not demonstrate sufficient efficacy versus 
placebo. Shares in bakers and general foods firm, Aryzta, rose by 10c to E22.90. Davy noted today that the broad 
movement in ingredient costs is favourable for bakeries at this time. There are various bakery ingredient indices in 
ISEQ edges lower led by Elan and banks ISEQ Falls
the US which calculate the ingredient cost of recipes using standard formulae. Up-to-date values indicate that year-
on-year ingredient costs are running about 25pc lower. "It would not appear that the fall in ingredient costs has 
followed through in wholesale or retail prices, suggesting that margin pick-up may still be countering the effect of 
softer demand."

Ryanair has mandated a syndicate of three banks for the $1.6 billion export credit agency financing of 55 737-800s.
BNP Paribas, Calyon and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are joint arrangers of the Ex/Im Bank Euro-
denominated facility. Calyon is underwriting 25 aircraft, with BNP and SMBC both underwriting 15 aircraft.
The aircraft will deliver between November 2009 and October 2010.
"It is testimony to the financial strength of Ryanair and the standing of our partners BNP Paribas, Calyon and SMBC 
that we have been able to complete a facility of this size in the current challenging financial markets," said Ryanair 
CFO Howard Millar.
"The securing of this facility will enable Ryanair to continue to grow its business and bring more competition, choice 
and lower fares to consumers in Europe."
Commenting on the deal, Eric Eugene, global head of transportation group BNP, Jose Abramovici, global head of 
aviation group & rail finance at Calyon and Craig Macdonald, head of aircraft finance at SMBC, collectively said:
"Ryanair has once again proven to be cost efficient not only in its operations, its aircraft purchasing, but also in 
negotiating the terms and conditions of its jumbo 55 aircraft financing in an unprecedented period of scarce liquidity 
from the aviation banking universe."
The deal comes on the back of the budget airline reporting a Q1 profit of (EURO)136.5 million ($194.8 million), but 
warning that further fare reductions will eat into its first year profits.

Highlight: Europe's largest budget carrier reports a Q1 profit of (EURO) 136.5 million but warns that lower fares will 
eat into full-year profits, while O'Leary accuses the UK government of killing British tourism.
Body
Ryanair has reported a first quarter profit of (EURO)136.5 million ($194.8 million), but said that lower fares will eat 
into full year profits and warned that restrictive taxes and airport charges are killing British tourism.
Europe's largest budget carrier recorded a net profit of (EURO)136.5 million for the quarter, marking a (EURO)15.5 
million, or 550%, increase compared to last year.
But chief executive officer Michael O'Leary suggested the large quarterly profit was misleading and mainly 
stemmed from a reduction in fuel costs, with revenues staying flat.
"These quarterly results are distorted by a 42% reduction in fuel costs," he said. The airline's decision not to hedge 
its fuel costs when the price had spiked last year accounted for the reduction.
O'Leary pointed out that in contrast to its competitors who have struggled amid declining traffic and yields, Ryanair's 
traffic grew by 11% during the quarter to 16.6 million.
"Our Q1 traffic growth has extended&Ryanair's leadership over the other big three, high fare, fuel surcharging 
airline groups - Air France, BA and Lufthansa," he said.
But the increased passenger traffic was down to a 13% reduction in average fares, O'Leary said.
He said further fare reductions, funded by fuel and other cost cuts, would impact future profitability and&was at the 
heart of the airline's cautious outlook for the rest of the year.
"We expect Q2 yield to be significantly lower than last year, at or even slightly above the minus 15% to 20% range 
previously guided."
O'Leary said that based on this half-year projection, the&carrier&is in line for a full-year decline of 20% or more, 
with a full-year net profit at the lower end of the (EURO)200 to (EURO)300 range previously forecast.
The outspoken Ryanair chief was particularly scathing of the UK government, which he accused of destroying 
tourism through restrictive taxes and charges.
Ryanair cautious despite profit
"The dramatic decline in Britain's traffic and tourism figures is directly due to the British government's £10 APD tax 
and the BAA's high airport charges."
He said traffic had declined by 9%, or a loss of almost five million passengers.
The Irish regulator, which O'Leary described as "clueless" and "totally out of touch with economic reality" came in 
for even stronger criticism.
"In Ireland, airlines and passengers continue to suffer at the hands of an inept and incompetent aviation regulator 
who should be removed," he said. "Despite the recession and a traffic collapse at Dublin airport, this failed regulator 
has recently proposed further cost increases at Dublin airport from January 2010, at a time when competitive 
airports all over Europe are reducing charges in order to grow traffic."
After Ryanair's full-year profit warning, its shares plunged almost 11% in early trading in Dublin, down (EURO)0.36 
to (EURO)3.005.

Aer Lingus has appointed former aviation director at TUI Travel Christopher Mueller as new chief executive officer. 
He will take up his position on October 1 and also joins the airline's board. 
He replaces Dermot Mannion who stepped down in April after fending off two hostile takeover bids from rival 
Ryanair.
Mueller was chief financial officer of DHL from 2002-2004 and joined TUI in 2006 where he became executive 
director after its merge with First Choice Holdiays.
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus is challenging a decision made by the European Commission in 2007 which ruled that 
Ryaniar could keep its stake in the airline. Ryanair holds a 29% stake in Aer Lingus.

Early gains on the Dublin shares market turned in to a loss by the end of the day amid dire economic data at home 
and abroad.
the ISEQ fell by 17.78 points to 2,706.08.
Ireland's economy shrank at a dramatic rate in the first quarter of this year, with GDP plunging 8.5pc compared to 
the same period in 2008, the latest figures from the CSO reveal. The decline in GNP (Gross National Product) - 
which excludes profits from multinational companies based here - was even bigger at 12pc. The seasonally 
adjusted estimates show that, compared with the previous quarter, GDP fell by 1.5 per cent and GNP by 4.5pc. In 
Q1 this year, consumer spending was more than 9pc lower than the same period in 2008, while capital investment 
plummeted by 34pc. Industrial output dropped 10.5pc over the year, including a fall of 31.4pc in construction output.
Meanwhile, our biggest trading partner, Britain, had the worst GDP figures in over 50 years. UK GDP fell by 2.4pc in 
the first quarter, revised down from a fall of 1.9pc. That was the biggest quarterly rate of decline since Q2 1958 and 
worse than analysts' predictions for a fall of 2.1pc. Shares in AIB edged up 4c to E1.73, Bank of Ireland declined by 
2c to E1.69 while Irish Life and Permanent rose by 14c to E3.51. Shares in Smurfit Kappa rose by 8c to E3.85. 
Following last's weeks capacity closure announcements from International Paper and Otor, Davy now estimate that 
the new capacity additions being introduced in Europe this year and next have been almost fully offset by capacity 
closures. Demand has declined by approximately 10-12pc year-on-year and this remains an issue to be resolved 
with further capacity announcements likely as the industry continues to operate below cash costs of production, 
Davy said. While easing weekly in line with the seasonal trend, the German green banana price (green bananas 
represent about half of Fyffes' volumes) closed the half-year strongly. Last week, the price was the highest for that 
week on Davy's records. Shares in Fyffes were down 1c at E0.33. Crude oil prices spiked at USD72 a barrel amid 
ongoing unrest in big oil producer, Nigeria. Davy says that Ryanair has hedged to the end of the third quarter of this

year but is far from immune to crude price rises. Shares in Ryanair fell by 9c to E3.27 while Aer Lingus failed to take 
off at E0.50. Figures released by the European Commission show that confidence levels in European construction 
markets improved slightly in June but remain deeply depressed with a reading of minus 38 compared to a minus 39 
in May. Shares in CRH fell by 3c to E16.30. Goodbody Stockbrokers' forecasts for Grafton have like-for-like sales in 
the UK declining by almost 17pc in the first half of the year and for this to moderate to a 9pc drop in the second half. 
"In terms of gaining confidence that trends will improve in the second half, we continue to closely monitor leading 
indicators like mortgage approvals. On this front it is of note that the improving trend in mortgage approvals stalled 
somewhat in May with a figure of 43.4k versus 43.2k in April and consensus of 46k," said analyst, Robert Eason. 
Grafton shares fell by 3c to E2.60.

Ryanair today slammed delays at the security check in Dublin Airport, saying that 50 of its passengers missed 
flights on Saturday.
The no-frills airline said that is the second major Dublin Airport security failure so far this summer after long queues 
on May 26 resulted in over 100 passengers missing their flights.
Ryanair passengers reported delays of over 30 minutes to clear passenger security which contradicts the DAA's 
recent claims that it takes a maximum of 15 minutes.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "The DAA's spokesperson, Siobhan Moore, claimed during radio interviews last 
month that it takes 'a maximum of 15 minutes' to clear security at Dublin Airport and denied claims that passengers 
were missing flights as a result of security queues. On Saturday, passengers had to suffer long (30 minute) security 
delays and over 50 Ryanair passengers missed flights as a result. Ryanair calls on DAA's Siobhan Moore to explain 
why the DAA Monopoly is unable to meet their 15 minute target and why hundreds of passengers were faced with 
security queues in excess of 30 minutes on Saturday morning and what extra measures they are putting in place to 
prevent it happening again."

Highlight: Declan Ryan's aviation company Thomas A Ryan Aerospace is facing a spate of legal actions
Body
Declan Ryan's aviation company Thomas A Ryan Aerospace is facing a spate of legal actions arising from the 
collapse of Italian state airline Alitalia last year.
The company, set up by Ryanair founder the late Tony Ryan, has received 'a number of legal claims arising from 
the insolvency of the company's lessee Alitalia.'
'The company is vigorously defending these claims and may issue counter claims against these parties,' according 
to latest company filings.
Alitalia collapsed last summer before being rescued by a consortium of Italian investors. It later sold a 25 per cent 
stake to Air France-KLM for nearly E325m. The Ryan-owned company was earlier involved in plans to buy a former 
military airport near Prague in the Czech republic, which it planned to turn into a massive air-cargo transport hub. 
Outside of Ryanair, the Ryan family have built up aviation interests around the globe, owning stakes in low-cost 
Asian carrier Tiger Airways and Mexican airline Viva Aerobus. The Ryans also owned a hefty chunk of allegiant 
Airways in the US but have gradually sold down their stake over the past few years.

Ryanair To Order 300 Aircraft By Year-end - Reports
Ryanair To Order 300 Aircraft By Year-end - Reports

(RTTNews) - Dublin-based low-budget carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) is all set to order 300 more aircraft 
from Airbus or Boeing Co. (BA) by the end of this year, reports revealed on Saturday.
Ryanair currently operates a fleet of 190 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The Irish airline apparently targets carrying up to 
150 million passengers annually by 2017, up from 58.5 million in 2008.
On June 2, the airline posted a net loss of 169 million euros ($239 million) for the year ended March 31, 2009, 
compared to net profit of 390.71 million euros a year before, hurt by higher fuel costs and a large write down on its 
stake in Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus. The company's annual revenues were 2.942 billion euros, up 8% over a year 
earlier.
Ryanair reportedly expects to report profit in the current financial year with estimated earnings in the range of 200 
million-300 million euros.
Blaming the government's 10 euro tourist tax and high charges levied by airport operator BAA, last week, Ryanair 
said it "will freeze growth at its nine UK bases with immediate effect." The company has also announced that it 
would axe 650 more jobs in Ireland.
RYAAY closed Friday's trading at $27.64, down 1.57% on a volume of 303,492 shares.

Ryanair and Wizz Air are among airlines interested in the possibility of turning an airfield in the Champagne region 
into a hub for low-cost carriers serving Paris, Christelle Riguet, a spokeswoman for Vatry airport, said Friday.
The airfield would provide easy access to Paris, just 39 minutes away from the nearby city of Reims by high-speed 
TGV rail. Local authorities have pledged to put in place bus service that could reach the Disneyland Paris theme 
park to the west.
Representatives from the Irish and Hungarian budget airlines attended a presentation about plans to make Paris 
Vatry, an international freight cargo airport located 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of Paris, into the French capital's 
low-cost airport, Riguet said.
The two low-cost carriers "are interested," Riguet said.
Paris Vatry officials said they are in talks aimed at launching operations in the coming months.
Ryanair and Wizz Air didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.
In a statement, Paris Vatry said it aims to be "Paris' Stansted", a reference to the London-area passenger airport 
that is a hub for some of Europe's major low-cost carriers.
Vatry airport has capacity to receive up to 7 million passengers annually, with a recently built terminal and free 
parking lot located on 1,850 hectares (4,564 acres).
Ryanair and Wizz Air both already fly to Beauvais airport, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the French capital.

Highlight: Airline aims to cut its handling costs
Online registration will be compulsory
Body
Ryanair is planning to stop passengers checking in baggage next year but will allow two or more pieces of carry-on 
luggage, as it steps up its drive to reduce airport handling costs.
The Irish carrier, the biggest short-haul airline in Europe by number of passengers, is making radical changes to 
airport check-in procedures, which could eventually force other airlines to follow its lead for short-haul, point-to-point 
flights, as it reinforces its competitive position as the lowest-cost and lowest-fare carrier in Europe.
From the beginning of October the airline al-ready plans to abolish conventional check-in facilities at airports across 
its European network, the first carrier to make such a move, forcing all passengers to check in online before leaving 
home or office.
From October the airline will still allow baggage to be checked in for the hold but will make significant charges for 
the "service".
But Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said yesterday the airline was planning a further stage next year when it 
would allow no checked-in baggage, but passengers would be allowed to carry more bags through security (two or 
more according to airport rules) to the aircraft.
They would still be allowed to carry only one bag into the cabin (maximum weight 10kg), but Mr O'Leary said a 
second bag could be left beside the aircraft to be loaded on and picked up on arrival.
Such procedures are already commonplace in the US for travellers flying on regional jet feeder services to main 
hub airports.
Mr O'Leary has already been successful in changing the travel habits of many passengers by introducing ever 
greater baggage charges to persuade passengers to travel only with -carry-on baggage. Only 30 per cent of 
Ryanair passengers now check in baggage for the hold, compared with 80 per cent two years ago.
Ryanair set to end bag check-ins at airports
In pushing through the changes, Mr O'Leary is gambling that the attraction of the lowest fares will keep passengers 
coming.
The airline is aiming to increase its passengers from 58m last year to 67m in this financial year to the end of March 
2010, and is one of the few airlines in Europe that is continuing to grow.
But Mr O'Leary warned yesterday that it was planning to freeze growth at its nine UK bases, partly as a protest 
against the further increases being introduced by the government in air passenger duty. He forecast the number of 
Ryanair passengers carried to and from UK airports would fall in this financial year to 32m from 34m last year, the 
first such decline, partly because of the impact of rising aviation taxation.
The Netherlands had scrapped a similar tax because of its impact on tourism, Belgium had withdrawn plans for 
such a levy and Greece and Spain were taking steps to cut airport changes, but the UK and Ireland were pressing 
ahead with increases in these "suicide" taxes, he said.

Ryanair confirmed today that it will freeze growth at its nine UK bases with immediate effect.
It blamed Gordon Brown's £10 tourist tax, "combined with the BAA Monopoly's high airport charges have caused 
the loss of over 4.5 million passengers at the BAA UK airports in the first five months of the year".
Ryanair called on Gordon Brown to scrap this £10 APD tax and speed up the sale of Gatwick and Stansted airports 
to prevent a further collapse in UK tourism and related jobs next winter.
If the UK traffic collapse continues for the full year the UK economy will lose over 10 million passengers, 10,000 
airport jobs and over £2.5billion in tourism spend in 2009 alone, with the Government losing at least £350 million in 
VAT receipts, it said. "The UK is now a high cost tourism destination which is in steep decline. Ryanair urged the 
British Government to follow the lead of the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish Governments who have recently 
scrapped similar tourist taxes and/or airport charges in order to reverse falling passenger numbers and prevent 
further tourism and job losses." Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "Ryanair will grow by 15pc this year to over 67 
million passengers. However, the UK will not share in any of this growth in 2009 as Ryanair (the only major 
European airline continuing to grow) freezes growth at our nine UK bases. Gordon Brown's £10 tourist tax will see 
Britain lose over 10 million passengers, 10,000 airport jobs and more than £2.5 billion in tourism spend in the UK 
this year alone. The Government should follow the example of their Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish 
counterparts by immediately scrapping this stupid and regressive tourist tax to avoid any further devastation to 
British tourism and jobs." "Tourism is one of the UK's most important industries and employers. It responds quickly 
to price changes. The Government's £10 tourist tax is making the UK an uncompetitive destination and they must 
scrap this tax now to prevent a further collapse of UK passenger, tourism and job numbers. While the UK keeps 
taxing tourists Ryanair will switch its growth to other EU countries where low cost airports are growing and where 
Governments are welcoming tourists not taxing them".

The Dublin shares market edged higher this morning but trading volumes were low amid doubts that recent signs of 
"green shoots" are pointing to a recovery.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 26.21 points at 2,729.35.
While there is mounting evidence of some 'Green Shoots" emerging from the world's major economies, it points to a 
slowing of the pace of the fall in growth, not - so far - actual recovery, AIB's chief economist, John Beggs said 
today.
He cautioned that, "we are not yet getting data pointing to an upturn in activity at a global level," echoing analysts in 
Europe and the US, who are becoming increasing cautious in their outlook. London's FTSE inched six points higher 
to 4,240 by 11am, while the Frankfurt DAX was up 23 points to 4,716 and the Paris CAC was flat at 3,123. The 
National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has received advanced orders totalling about E8 billion for 
sovereign debt bonds in an auction held yesterday, according to reports. This time it was a new benchmark ten-
year issue in a syndicated deal. It means that the government has now raised close to E20 billion of the E25 billion 
that economists think it requires in long-term funding for 2009. The auction plan for the third quarter will soon be in 
place: those events will raise enough in the second half of this year to meet the target, Davy Research said this 
morning. Shares in AIB rose by 1c to E1.75 after a rout yesterday, Bank of Ireland jumped 13c to E1.83 while Irish 
Life and Permanent was flat at E2.95. The newspapers are full of the story that Irish Nationwide has taken a case in 
the Commercial Court against developer Liam Carroll, who is one of the largest developers in the state. It is making 
a E60m personal claim against him, which was apparently a personal guarantee given by him in exchange for 
borrowings granted. Elsewhere, the fall in bitumen costs in the US is potentially good news for CRH. In a stable 
budget environment, this should result in an increase in the volume of highways being constructed and therefore an

The Dublin shares market edged higher this morning but trading volumes were low amid doubts that recent signs of 
"green shoots" are pointing to a recovery.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 26.21 points at 2,729.35.
While there is mounting evidence of some 'Green Shoots" emerging from the world's major economies, it points to a 
slowing of the pace of the fall in growth, not - so far - actual recovery, AIB's chief economist, John Beggs said 
today.
He cautioned that, "we are not yet getting data pointing to an upturn in activity at a global level," echoing analysts in 
Europe and the US, who are becoming increasing cautious in their outlook. London's FTSE inched six points higher 
to 4,240 by 11am, while the Frankfurt DAX was up 23 points to 4,716 and the Paris CAC was flat at 3,123. The 
National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has received advanced orders totalling about E8 billion for 
sovereign debt bonds in an auction held yesterday, according to reports. This time it was a new benchmark ten-
year issue in a syndicated deal. It means that the government has now raised close to E20 billion of the E25 billion 
that economists think it requires in long-term funding for 2009. The auction plan for the third quarter will soon be in 
place: those events will raise enough in the second half of this year to meet the target, Davy Research said this

the Commercial Court against developer Liam Carroll, who is one of the largest developers in the state. It is making 
a E60m personal claim against him, which was apparently a personal guarantee given by him in exchange for 
borrowings granted. Elsewhere, the fall in bitumen costs in the US is potentially good news for CRH. In a stable

Still reeling from its worse ever results and a scathing attack from Virgin owner Richard Branson, British Airways is 
determined to show customers that no frill deals are actually more expensive than flights with the nation's flag 
carrier.
The airline has launched a 'value calculator' on its ba.com website which will allow customers to check the cost of 
Ryanair and EasyJet's added charges versus the value of BA's service.
'With BA, the price you see is the price you pay. It's been well documented that some of the no-frills carriers charge 
for a range of 'extras' that we consider to be part of our core service, from checking in a bag to food and drinks on 
board. We're just making these transparent for customers,' said Richard Tams, head of UK & Ireland sales at British 
Airways.
He says these added costs can add up to as much as £375 on Ryanair return flights.
'We think people will be pleasantly surprised when they see what great value our fares offer. The no frills carriers 
claim they're always cheaper. Our calculator shows they are not.'
The system enables customers to select how they're choosing to travel, be that checking in at the airport or online, 
selecting a seat 24-hours before they fly, taking a bag, or opting for food and drink on board, allowing you to see 
what the three airlines will charge in total for those options.

Lufthansa gets EU OK to buy Brussels Airlines
Lufthansa gets EU OK to buy Brussels Airlines

Lufthansa AG won EU regulators' permission Monday to take a large stake in Brussels Airlines but must give up 
slots at Belgian, German and Swiss airports to eliminate antitrust concerns.
Lufthansa plans to spend €65 million on a 45 percent stake in the holding company that owns the Belgian carrier. 
The deal due to close by the end of June gives the German airline the option to take over all of Brussels Airlines in 
2011 for not more than €250 million.
The European Commission said Lufthansa had agreed to sell airport slots to other airlines for flights between 
Brussels airport to Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg and Zurich to soothe EU concerns that Lufthansa would become the 
only airline serving these routes.
Slots are the daily periods of time that airlines get to land and take off from airports. They are valuable, changing 
hands for as much as 30 million pounds a pair at Europe's busiest airport, London Heathrow.
EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said conditions attached to the slot sale such as long-term rights and linking up with 
other Lufthansa flights and its frequent flyer program were "very attractive" and would tempt other airlines to start up 
new routes.
Airlines are facing a tough year and huge losses as business and leisure travelers stay home during the economic 
slowdown. Brussels Airlines' passenger traffic fell 14 percent in the first four months of this year from 2008 
outpacing a 6 percent drop for all major European airlines.
Lufthansa has swooped down on several troubled airlines in recent months. It is also planning to buy the Austrian 
government's 41.56 percent stake in the struggling Austrian Airlines.
It bought 80 percent of BMI British Midland last year, giving it the most total slots at Heathrow after British Airways.
It has also built up an Italian network, Lufthansa Italia and purchased a stake in American carrier JetBlue Airways, 
adding to other airlines it controls: Swiss International, Italy's Air Dolomiti, Eurowings, and budget airline 
Germanwings.
Lufthansa gets EU OK to buy Brussels Airlines
Most of Europe's airlines are former national flag carriers that run the majority of flights outside of their homeland. 
That makes combining with other airlines difficult because merging with a rival can make them a monopoly player.
The EU blocked Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus in 2007 because the company would control most flights out of Dublin.

Cathal Ryan, the son of the late Ryanair founder, Tony Ryan, who died in 2007, has left almost  250 million in his 
will.
Records filed at the Probate Office in Dublin last week show that Ryan left an estate of  249,694,000 when he died 
on December 20, 2007. The 48-year-old businessman, who lived in Celbridge, Co Kildare, had suffered from 
cancer.
High Court probate documents revealed that Ryan instructed trustees of his estate to give  35m to charity - 
including at least  10m to charities helping Irish children, the performing arts and higher education.
Ryan was one of the first Ryanair pilots and was a director of the airline from 1996 to 2002. He was also a director 
of Irelandia Investments, the Ryan family's investment company, which has shareholdings in Tiger Airways in Asia 
and VivaAerobus in Mexico. It has also made investments in emerging biotechnology and medical devices 
companies.
Ryan was also involved in a number of other business ventures. He was an owner and breeder of horses and 
supported the Irish drama and medical groups. Since his death, the Cathal Ryan Trust has announced plans for a 
theatre and academy of dramatic arts at NUI Maynooth.
Ryan was survived by his children Cillian, Claudia, Danielle and Cameron and by his mother and brothers. He died 
less than three months after the death of his father.

Airlines add fees and some fees on top of fees
Airlines add fees and some fees on top of fees

Body
As if charging $15 to check a bag weren't enough, two airlines are asking for $5 more beginning this summer if you 
pay at the check-in counter a fee on top of a fee.
Of course, you could always pay your baggage fee from home. The airlines call it the "online discount."
If airlines can get away with that, what's next? Rather than raise fares in the middle of a recession, they're piling on 
fees to make money fees for bags, fees to get through the line faster, even fees for certain seats.
United Airlines alone expects to rake in more than $1 billion this year in fees ranging from baggage to accelerated 
frequent-flier awards. That's more than 5 percent of its revenue.
The most likely new fees are those that some airline, somewhere, has tried. Fees usually originate with one or two 
airlines, and competitors watch to see whether passengers accept them or revolt. For instance:
 US Airways and United are hitting passengers up for $5 to pay their baggage fees at the airport instead of online. 
United implemented the fee June 10, while US Airways will put it into effect July 9.
 If you want to select an exit row seat on AirTran and enjoy the extra legroom, expect to cough up $20.
 Allegiant Air, a smaller national discount airline, charges a $13.50 "convenience fee" for online purchases, even 
though most other carriers encourage purchases direct from their Web site.
 European discounter Ryanair charges for something everyone has to do if they want to fly: check in. It's 5 euros, or 
about $6.75, to check in online, double for passengers who pay at the airport. Ryanair plans to eliminate airport 
check-in desks.
 Spanish airline Vueling charges a fee to pick a seat. Any seat at all. A "basic" seat behind the wing runs 3 euros. 
For 30 euros, travelers can choose an aisle or window seat and guarantee that the middle seat will remain empty.
Airlines add fees and some fees on top of fees
"They need to chill out with those," said a frustrated Jim Engineer, a public relations executive waiting for a flight out 
of New York's LaGuardia. "Charging for a glass of water and seats just translates into unhappy customers."
As recently as last year, most fliers only came across a fee if they checked three bags or sent a minor child across 
the country. Most people, most of the time, traveled fee-free.
But that began to change last spring. Spiking jet fuel prices and passenger resistances to higher fares started 
airlines looking around the cabin for things they could charge extra for.
Passengers are finding it's a lot easier for the airlines to add the fees than to take them away.
"They're going to keep nudging them up until they run into market resistance," said Ed Perkins, a contributing editor 
at the Web site Smarter Travel.
That's what happened at US Airways. It tried for seven months to charge for soda and water but gave up in March 
after no other airlines took up the idea. And Delta scaled back a plan to charge $50 to check a second bag on all 
international flights. Instead, the charge will apply only on flights to Europe.
United has been a leader in finding ways to charge passengers separately for things. Some are for perks coach 
travelers used to get for free, like food. Others are new services altogether, like United's door-to-door luggage 
service via FedEx.
Airlines say fees are part of "a la carte" pricing that allows them to hold the line on fares. Rather than charge higher 
fares to everyone, they say, passengers can pick and choose the extras they want to pay for.
Ideas for fees don't come out of thin air. Last month in Miami most of the big U.S. carriers and many overseas 
airlines attended a conference devoted to a-la-carte pricing and fees. (Motto, next to a cartoon of an airliner: 
"Discovering the flying store.")
Some fees stretch the imagination: The CEO of European discount carrier Ryanair has floated the idea of charging 
for lavatory use and sick bags. But even he hasn't gone ahead with what appears to have been a publicity-seeking 
gambit, and no other carrier has suggested such a charge.
Still, there's no rule against such a fee in the U.S., according to the Department of Transportation and the Federal 
Aviation Administration.
Delta Air Lines Inc. and AirTran Holdings Inc. say they have no plans to tack a fee on to carry-on bags, an idea that 
would almost certainly annoy passengers just getting used to paying for checked baggage.
It would also put airline workers in the awkward position of deciding whether that bag on your arm is a big purse, 
presumably free, or a lumpy suitcase. Already, fees for checked bags have made finding space in the overhead bin 
tougher.
And even if carry-on bags stay free, United is already offering a "Premier Line" check-in for $25. It allows fliers to 
get through check-in and security faster and board earlier.
That guarantees some of that precious overhead space so in a way, it's like a carry-on fee, said Jay Sorensen, 
president of IdeaWorks Co., an airline consultant who has written a guidebook for airlines seeking "ancillary 
revenue," the industry term for fees and extra services such as airline credit cards.
Matthew J. Bennett, CEO of FirstClassFlyer.com, said he thinks travelers in the front of the plane will remain 
immune from the nickle-and-dime fees airlines aim at coach passengers.
For those in coach, though, "What they are going to charge for in the future is anything that's not bolted down."
Airlines add fees and some fees on top of fees
"They've already gotten sufficient revenue from them," Bennett said. "All they're saying to coach-class travelers is 
'We really haven't gotten enough from you.'"

The Dublin shares market rose steadily this morning amid hints that more "green shoots" of economic recovery are 
sprouting in the US.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained by 47.70 points to 2,820.06.
The US Conference Board leading indicator flashed an end-of-recession signal as expected in May. The six-month 
rate of change turned positive. It has never fired a false signal before and this time is unlikely to prove any different. 
The question now is pinpointing the exact month of the trough. Davy expect the US economy to bottom around 
September or October. By that stage, growth in new orders will translate into actual activity. The housing market 
may also have improved a touch.
Shares in AIB rose by 4c to E1.91, Bank of Ireland gained 8c to E1.89 and Irish Life and Permanent jumped 12c to 
E3.30. The value of highway contracts awarded by US state departments of transport (DOT) increased by 6pc in 
May, the first year-on-year increase recorded this year. The increase more than likely reflects the first signs of 
infrastructure stimulus funding coming through. The rate of increase is likely to accelerate as the year progresses, 
predicted Davy. Shares in CRH surged 37c to E17.69. Shares in Aer Lingus edged up 1c to E0.50 while Ryanair 
moved down 2c to E3.24. For the first time since 2000, the number of Irish people travelling abroad declined - 
falling 13pc in the first three months of this year compared to the same period last year, the latest figures from the 
CSO show. The number of Irish Visits abroad from January to March 2009 was 1,540,000 compared to the 
1,762,000 who travelled in the same period in 2008. In an initiative widely expected over the last 2-3 months, the 
Irish government has finally (re)introduced reductions in reimbursement to the Irish pharmacy sector. A version of 
this scheme was implemented in September 2007 but was subsequently removed after a court challenge. The 
changes affect both income streams that pharmacies receive from government. Firstly, the direct reimbursement

margin for drugs is being reduced from 17.66pc to 10pc from July 1st. This is slightly less than the reduction to 8pc

had held up better than expected with sales down 17pc in the first four months of the year. "Overall, there were no 
surprises in the latest retail sales figures given that the period was covered by the trading statement, so we keenly 
await the next month's data." Grafton's shares gained 1c to E2.61.

Wizz Air signals expansion drive by signing deal for 50 Airbus jets
Wizz Air signals expansion drive by signing deal for 50 Airbus jets

Wizz Air, the leading low-cost airline in central and eastern Europe, is to place an order for 50 short-haul jets from 
Airbus, as it seeks to become one of the leading budget airlines in Europe, reports Kevin Done.
The group, which began flying in May 2004, has 26 Airbus A320s in its fleet.
The latest purchase, agreed in a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday, will take its total orders from the 
European aircraft maker to 132.
The agreement, which is expected to become a firm order within days, has a value of $3.8bn at list prices before 
discounts. Airbus has eclipsed its rival Boeing at the Paris air show this week.
Despite the recession and the caution shown by many global carriers, the European aircraft maker has secured firm 
orders or letters of intent for more than 100 jets this week.
They are chiefly for short-haul aircraft, including 24 for Qatar Airways and 16 for Vietnam Airlines.
The only significant order for widebody jets has been placed by AirAsia X, the world's pioneering long-haul, low-cost 
airline, which has ordered 10 400-seat Airbus A350-900s.
Wizz Air is continuing to expand quickly in similar fashion to Ireland's Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, 
despite the deep recession in the air travel market.
The low-cost airline business model is proving much more robust in the downturn than the operations of the 
traditional network carriers.
Both Wizz Air, which has its headquarters in Budapest, and Ryanair are continuing to add capacity and expand 
their fleets.
In contrast, rival full service airlines such as British Airways, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have announced 
capacity cuts.

Wizz Air has already established a network of 11 operating bases in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine 
and the Czech Republic as it expands through the region with a network of more than 130 routes.
Jozsef Varadi, the airline's chief executive, said the group was planning to expand its passenger numbers this year 
by around 27 per cent from 5.9m last year to 7.5m.
The main shareholder in Wizz Air is Indigo Partners, the US private equity fund led by Bill Franke, which is also a 
founding investor in the Singapore-based low-cost carrier Tiger Airways.

Aviation Regulator, Cathal Guiomard, has proposed further hikes in airport charges for travellers.
The charges will increase from E7.39 to E8.35 per passenger under the proposals, which need approval from the 
Government.
The regulator's draft decision says the impact of the economic downturn means there are fewer passengers than 
expected from which to recover costs.
Ryanair has slammed the proposals. Ryanair said there is no justification during a recession for further cost 
increases at a Government owned airport monopoly, or for these being sanctioned by a Government appointed 
Regulator. "At a time when airports all over Europe are lowering charges, this Regulator is hopelessly out of touch 
with economic reality. These further cost increases, when added to the Government's suicidal E10 tourist tax, 
means that further traffic and tourism declines in Ireland are inevitable." Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "The 
sanctioning of further cost increases at the high cost Dublin Airport monopoly proves that Ireland's Aviation 
Regulator is useless. In recent weeks the Greek Government has reduced regional airport charges to zero, and the 
Spanish Government is rebating airport charges in the latter half of 2009 by 100pc for those airlines like Ryanair, 
delivering growth. Airports all over the UK and Continental Europe are lowering their charges to reflect declining 
traffic and the recession. Only in Ireland is the Government owned airport increasing charges, sanctioned by a 
useless Government appointed Regulator, at a time when the Government should be trying to stimulate, not 
strangle, tourism." "Is it any wonder that traffic at Dublin Airport has collapsed by 11pc in the first five months of this 
year. Today's proposed increases show that Ireland's Aviation Regulator is useless. In the UK, the Competition 
Commission has called for the break up of the BAA airport monopoly, having recognised that Regulation has failed 
to protect the consumer interest. In Ireland, this useless Regulator has repeatedly failed to protect consumers, and 
today's cost increase is just the latest evidence of this abysmal failure."

19c to E3.27 amid heated debates in the Dail over the "haircut" banks will have to take in transferring bad loans to 
NAMA.

by 57c to E15.40 and Ryanair was down 4c at E3.37. Blaming the E10 Government travel tax, Ryanair this 
afternoon said it is cutting one aircraft each from its Shannon and Dublin bases. The no-frills airline said that this 
would result in the loss of 350 jobs and 350,000 passengers at Dublin and 350 jobs and 300,000 passengers at 
Shannon. Wynnstay, the UK agricultural and retail group, that is a peer to Ireland's Origin Enterprises, unveiled its 
results today. Operating profit increased slightly (4pc), as gains in its pet stores offset lower feed and fertiliser sales. 
It is not surprising that fertiliser and feed sales have entered negative territory, as farmers are delaying purchasing 
decisions due to high prices. Origin shares were down 15c at E2.65. The first half of the calendar year is the most 
critical for banana profits. In this period, prices and volumes are seasonally highest. With the half-year at hand and

prices), the outlook for Fyffes for the half- and full-year looks positive, according to Davy's analyst, John O'Reilly. 
Fyffes shares fell 2c to E0.33. The annualised rate of US housing starts in May were 532,000, seasonally adjusted, 
which was comfortably better than the consensus expectation of 490,000. The housing starts figures for May also 
marked something of a bounce from the revised April reading of 454,000. Ireland's CRH derives nearly half of its

Blaming the E10 Government travel tax, Ryanair this afternoon said it is cutting one aircraft each from its Shannon 
and Dublin bases.
The no-frills airline said that this would result in the loss of 350 jobs and 350,000 passengers at Dublin and 350 jobs 
and 300,000 passengers at Shannon.
In the first five months of 2009 traffic at Dublin Airport has fallen by 11pc, a loss of a million passengers in just five 
months.
"If this traffic collapse continues for the full year it will mean the loss of 2.5 million passengers, 2,500 jobs at Dublin 
Airport and E750 million of tourism spend in the Irish economy in 2009," Ryanair said. Ryanair today announced 
that it would cut its base aircraft by one at both Dublin from 17 to 16 and Shannon, from 4 to 3 this winter. Further 
cuts in winter flight and traffic numbers will be announced in the coming months if the Government fails to scrap the 
E10 tourist tax, it warned. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "The Irish Government's E10 tourist tax is "tourism 
suicide" which is devastating visitor numbers and jobs. Price sensitive visitors are switching to lower cost 
destinations in Europe where governments welcome tourists, not tax them." "Ryanair will remove one aircraft from 
both Dublin and Shannon this winter and further cuts can be expected in the coming months if the E10 tourist tax is 
not scrapped. If the tourist tax is scrapped these cuts, and the tourism collapse, will be reversed." "This tourist tax 
will raise just E125 million per annum and for this tiny tax revenue the Irish government will lose over 2,500 jobs 
and more than E750 million in tourism spend, the VAT receipts on which would exceed E150 million," he said.

The main Dublin shares index slid by over 50 points this morning, weighed down by bank shares amid fears that US 
economic 'green shoots' may in fact be a 'false dawn'.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 54.25 points to 2,833.45.
US stocks had ended in negative territory last night as investors sifted a slew of economic data for signs that a 
recovery could be taking root from the severe recession but found as much to discourage the hope as there was to 
stoke it.
Shares in AIB slumped 25c to E1.87, Bank of Ireland declined by 18c to E1.75 and Irish Life and Permanent lost 
13c to E3.33. Opposition leader, Enda Kenny, today asked the Taoiseach to clarify whether market speculation that 
the discount on impaired bank loans to NAMA will be just 20pc and not the 40pc some believe. The Fine Gael 
leader demanded the Taoiseach "clear up the element of confusion" surrounds the discount to be applied to the 
assets. "What's happening now is that the bank shares are beginning to climb and the country's credit rating is 
continuing to decline and the reason for that is that the banks have been saying to their shareholders that the 
discount will be 20pc," he said. The Taoiseach said that the Dail could be recalled in September to debate and vote 
on the long-awaited NAMA legislation. Sterling has continued to strengthen against the Euro in recent days, 
rebounding from the lows of two weeks ago, when Gordon Brown's Government faced the instability of a number of 
top level cabinet resignations. Sterling has gained 4.5pc to 84.5 against the Euro since then, after renewed 
weakness in the European currency. "The benefit from sterling strength will be seen in the Irish market earnings 
outlook should it continue this trend. This is particularly true of DCC, Greencore, Grafton, Kerry and Ryanair but the 
benefit is felt throughout the Irish market and the Irish economy," said Bloxham Stockbrokers. DCC shares plunged 
60c to E15.70, Greencore was down 2c to E1.15, Grafton declined by 9c to E2.80, Kerry rose by 52c to E15.35 and

The main Dublin shares index slid by over 50 points this morning, weighed down by bank shares amid fears that US 
economic 'green shoots' may in fact be a 'false dawn'.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 54.25 points to 2,833.45.
US stocks had ended in negative territory last night as investors sifted a slew of economic data for signs that a 
recovery could be taking root from the severe recession but found as much to discourage the hope as there was to 
stoke it.
Shares in AIB slumped 25c to E1.87, Bank of Ireland declined by 18c to E1.75 and Irish Life and Permanent lost 
13c to E3.33. Opposition leader, Enda Kenny, today asked the Taoiseach to clarify whether market speculation that 
the discount on impaired bank loans to NAMA will be just 20pc and not the 40pc some believe. The Fine Gael 
leader demanded the Taoiseach "clear up the element of confusion" surrounds the discount to be applied to the 
assets. "What's happening now is that the bank shares are beginning to climb and the country's credit rating is 
continuing to decline and the reason for that is that the banks have been saying to their shareholders that the 
discount will be 20pc," he said. The Taoiseach said that the Dail could be recalled in September to debate and vote 
on the long-awaited NAMA legislation. Sterling has continued to strengthen against the Euro in recent days, 
rebounding from the lows of two weeks ago, when Gordon Brown's Government faced the instability of a number of 
top level cabinet resignations. Sterling has gained 4.5pc to 84.5 against the Euro since then, after renewed 
weakness in the European currency. "The benefit from sterling strength will be seen in the Irish market earnings 
outlook should it continue this trend. This is particularly true of DCC, Greencore, Grafton, Kerry and Ryanair but the 
benefit is felt throughout the Irish market and the Irish economy," said Bloxham Stockbrokers. DCC shares plunged 
60c to E15.70, Greencore was down 2c to E1.15, Grafton declined by 9c to E2.80, Kerry rose by 52c to E15.35 and

Family tragedy contributed to Ryanair captain's actions 
Poor weather at Rome and inexperienced co-pilot named as factors in unstable approach
Investigators believe a newly bereaved Ryanair captain's psychological state, combined with his co-pilot's 
inexperience, led to an unplanned and highly unstable approach to Rome during poor weather conditions.
Italy's ANSV investigation agency says the captain's three-month-old son had died just a few days before the 
Niederrhein-Rome Ciampino flight, but he had not informed anyone of the situation, partly out of concern for his job.
The ANSV, which has just released details of the September 2005 incident, adds that the co-pilot of the Boeing 
737-800 - who had just 300h on type from 475h total - had not previously flown in adverse weather conditions.
The crew had already been forced to weave a path around storms during a prolonged attempt to land at Ciampino. 
But instead of diverting to its alternate, Pescara, the crew opted for an unplanned diversion to Rome Fiumicino.
The investigation agency says the crew failed to brief properly for this, and did not update the flight management 
system during the turbulent conditions, resulting in the pilots' rapidly losing position awareness.
While south of Fiumicino and being flown manually, the jet started turning right at 3,880ft (1,180m) in preparation for 
the 34L approach. It crossed the extended 34L centreline, but continued to veer to the right, crossing the centreline 
of 34L again.
The ANSV says the co-pilot failed to switch radio frequency to Fiumicino approach and instead requested descent 
to 2,000ft. As the aircraft was heading for the parallel 34R approach path, controllers ordered an immediate descent 
to 1,000ft as this approach was in use by a Club Air flight.
INTRODUCTION:
The 737 crossed the 34R centreline at 1,650ft, about 3nm (5km)behind the Club Air flight, and controllers instructed 
the Ryanair crew track left and realign with the 34L approach.
But the crew was not informed that they were flying too low - 770ft below the correct profile of 2,200ft - and the 
situation deteriorated as the aircraft, according to the captain, entered a violent downward microburst. The 737 
recrossed the 34R extended centreline, while still about 6nm south of the runway, at just 370ft before finally 
abandoning the approach and diverting to Pescara.
It landed with 1,250kg (2,750lb) of fuel, from an initial upload of 8,200kg covering the flight minimum, plus 950kg for 
contingency.
The ANSV says the unplanned diversion left the crew "without a definite strategy" and a "largely absent" decision-
making process. Loss of situational awareness meant the captain, already in a poor psychological state, was forced 
to concentrate solely on flying the aircraft, with the co-pilot able to provide only limited support - although the ANSV 
credits the co-pilot with prompting the final decision to abort.
Issues about access to timely weather information and the need for better minimum safe altitude warnings, as well 
as the possibility of fatigue, are also highlighted by the investigation.
Ryanair changed its operations manual following the incident to emphasise the flight safety implications of personal 
trauma, and the importance of notification to flight operations management.

Now that the Italian investigation into a scary Ryanair trip to Rome four years ago has been published, airlines have 
an official object lesson in why pilots need skillful management. And Ryanair appears to have been first to take the 
embedded messages on board. 
But the incident in 2005 was serious, and it was not the only one of its type Ryanair had suffered. At the time 
Ryanair had an adversarial relationship with its pilot workforce, and the captain of the Boeing 737-800 that diverted 
from Rome Ciampino via Fiumicino to Pescara showed symptoms of that relationship. He had failed to tell the 
operations department that his young son had just died and that he did not feel fit to fly, as he felt insecure in his job 
and had no faith that this would be seen as a valid reason for being excused duty. 
Despite his emotional state, the captain would probably have had an uneventful flight from D?sseldorf that day if the 
weather at his destination had not been challenging. The area around Rome was dotted with thunderstorms, and 
the approach entailed dodging them. Decisions had to be made because the situation was changing rapidly in other 
ways too, like being given a late change of runway from 15 to 33. It became clear the captain was, on that day, not 
fully capable of making decisions and flying the aircraft at the same time. The relatively inexperienced co-pilot 
saved him from his own misjudgements, and the 737 diverted to Pescara.
Even now industrial relations at Ryanair could scarcely be described as cuddly, but as far as the pilots are 
concerned they have improved considerably. Soon after the Ciampino incident, the company clarified its policy 
about flying in the wake of traumatic personal events, but it took a while longer and another interesting incident for 
the strained atmosphere to calm down.
A pilot's job is particularly safety critical. Their personal performance matters, not just in the sense they should be 
unlikely to make mistakes, but because they are also, as Capt Don Maurino at the International Civil Aviation

Organisation says, "the system's goalkeepers". Occasionally they have to cope with mistakes made by 
maintenance people, the operations department, or corporate management.
Flightcrew do more than prevent accidents. They can manage their airline's most expensive assets - and the 
customers - either skillfully and efficiently, or indifferently, in direct proportion to how well they themselves are 
managed.

Highlight: Profits at Kerry Airport fell by 40 per cent last year after an increase in overheads
Body
Profits at Kerry Airport fell by 40 per cent last year after an increase in overheads, while its passenger numbers 
grew by 8 per cent to 419,114 due to its new Luton service provided by Ryanair.
Kerry said that its final profits after tax for the year ending October 2008 fell to E327,541 from E565,809 the 
previous year. Revenue grew by 6.7 per cent to E6.976m.
Overhead costs were up 13 per cent in the year due mainly to a change in the operator of its public service 
obligation route to Dublin, which required a change in staff, ground handling and emergency services.
'Our growth in traffic is encouraging considering the global economic events of 2008,' commented Denis Cregan, 
the chairman of Kerry Airport. 'Profit levels are less than those targeted and particular concern is that our cost base 
continues to expand at rates greater than our revenue growth, which is unsustainable and will require action,' he 
cautioned. Kerry Airport currently has three daily flights to Dublin, twice-daily flights to London Stansted, three 
weekly flights to London Luton and five weekly service to Frankfurt Hahn.

By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 31.60 points to 2,938.55.
Risk markets continue to slowly regain confidence. Last week, a number of key variables remained stable to slightly

Highlight: Ryanair has opened talks with both Boeing and Airbus about ordering up to 300 more aircraft
Body
Ryanair has opened talks with both Boeing and Airbus about ordering up to 300 more aircraft in a deal that would 
make the low-budget carrier more than double the size of aviation giant, British Airways.
The order would be split in to two separate delivery contracts of 200 aircraft followed by 100 more later.
Chief executive, Michael O'Leary said that the airline could pay well over USD7bn for the 200-aircraft deal with 
delivery starting in 2013.
Ryanair did not engage in advanced talks on the aircraft order with either of the two plane builders as is normal 
industry procedures. Instead, Mr O'Leary said that he was quite happy to wait until Boeing's and Airbus's "order 
book collapses" due to the downturn in the world economy and falling passenger numbers to negotiate a better 
deal, he said. The planes have a sticker price of about USD70 million each but Ryanair expects to negotiate at least 
a 50pc discount to pay about USD35m to USD40m each for a total, he said. "The sticker price is USD70m, but we 
would never dream of paying anything like that," he told reporters after a news conference on the airline's plans in 
Italy. Despite Ryanair's historic relationship with Boeing, O'Leary said he would order planes from Airbus if they 
offered a cheaper price. In that case, Ryanair would simply designate some of its airport bases as those for Airbus 
planes, he said. The planes would be delivered between 2013 and 2016, he said. Ryanair has a fleet of 171 Boeing 
737-800, and has firm orders to bring that up to 310 planes by 2012, he said. If Ryanair adds another 300 aircraft to 
its fleet by 2016, it would have just under 600 planes in total compared with BA's current fleet of 248. Southwest, 
the pioneering US low-cost airline, owns more than 500 planes. Jim McNerney, Boeing chief executive, described 
the potential order as "the deal of the year". Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest customers and in 2007 it acquired 
27 Boeing 737-800s at a combined list price of USD1.9 billion, though the airline is thought to have secured a 
significant discount. Speaking ahead of the Paris Air Show, which takes place this week, McNerney said 
discussions had already opened with Ryanair. "I know there are some discussions. It is a very important order and 
it is something we would have to pay very close attention to." A Ryanair spokesman confirmed discussions had 
Ryanair raises massive aircraft order Ryanair orders
started on ordering aircraft that would be delivered from 2012 onwards. The airline operates about 190 Boeing 
aircraft, rising to 301 in 2012 when its latest order is completed. Michael O'Leary has set an informal target of 150 
million passengers by 2016, compared with the 67 million customers that the airline expects to carry this year. In 
the medium term, it aims to carry 100 million passengers by 2012 - treble the amount carried by BA last year. 
However, analysts cautioned that some of the aircraft ordered from 2012 onwards could be replacement planes for 
older aircraft earmarked for disposal, which would leave Ryanair with a smaller fleet.

Aer Lingus slashes winter service over Atlantic
Aer Lingus slashes winter service over Atlantic

Aer Lingus will slash several transatlantic winter services, reducing its seat capacity by a quarter, due to a decline in 
passenger numbers, the Irish airline said Friday.
Service between Dublin and San Francisco and Dublin and Washington will stop on Oct. 25. The airline will also 
suspend the Shannon-Chicago route from Sept. 1 and reduce its services between Shannon and Boston. Service 
between Shannon and New York "remains under close review."
The cuts are planned to last through March, but the summer schedule is subject to review, the airline said.
Aer Lingus said it was ending some long-haul services "to address the significant losses generated over the winter 
period and which are now exacerbated by extremely weak demand and falling yields."
The airline is expected to record losses of €100 million ($140 million) this year, with average long fares down 19 
percent in the first quarter. In May, year-on-year transatlantic passenger numbers were down 21 percent to 90,000.
The service reduction from Shannon is a blow to the west of Ireland, where the tourism sector relies heavily on 
visitors from North America. Ryanair has already reduced its short-haul services at Shannon, and Delta Airlines 
said Thursday it was stopping its transatlantic services from Shannon in October
"It would be a bitter blow if the linkages particularly the Aer Lingus link with New York were to be severed in any 
sort of a permanent fashion," said Tony Brazil, managing director of Limerick Travel.
Brazil was actively opposed to a 2007 Aer Lingus decision to end a Shannon-Heathrow route. That service 
resumed in March after campaigning by businesspeople, tourism officials and airline workers near Shannon.

Body
Ireland will lose 2,500 jobs and E1.5 billion tourism spend in 2009 because of this "stupid" E10 tourist tax, Ryanair 
said today, adding its voice to Aer Lingus, who said the tax is crippling the industry.
In the first five months of 2009 over a million fewer passengers travelled through Irish airports, resulting in the loss 
of at least 1,000 jobs at Ireland airports and over E600 million in tourism revenues, Ryanair claims.
Statistics from the Airport Council International (ACI) confirm that every 1 million passengers at an airport create 
and sustain 1,000 jobs. Similarly Failte Ireland statistics estimate that oversees visitors spend an average of E600 
visiting Ireland. If the traffic collapse of the first five months continues for the full year the Irish economy will lose 
over 2.5 million passengers, over 2,500 airport jobs and over E1.5 billion in tourism spend in 2009 alone.
Meanwhile, transatlantic Aer Lingus services to and from Shannon could be severely curtailed this winter unless 
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan rescinds the airport travel tax introduced in last December's Budget, the airline has 
warned. In a letter to Mr Lenihan, Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington said that all the carrier's US services to and 
from Shannon face 'acute' challenges this winter. He also said that Aer Lingus services from Dublin to Washington 
and San Francisco are also under pressure.

Mr Barrington said it was his strong belief that this tax was costing the country dearly and that the country was

Aer Lingus had written two previous letters to the Government on the issue. In the latest letter, Mr Barrington says 
the situation for the airline industry has since deteriorated, with no signs of improvement.

Body
After one of the best rallies in over a year, the ISEQ slumped yesterday after global ratings agency, Standard and 
Poor's said that it has cut its long-term sovereign credit rating on Ireland to 'AA' from 'AA+'.
The ISEQ fell by 71.84 points to 2,860.44.
S and P cut Ireland's debt rating because it believes the cost to the government of supporting the country's 
struggling banks will be higher than expected. "The rating could be lowered again if asset quality in the Irish 
banking system deteriorates at a faster pace than we expect," S and P said in a statement.
The news sent banking shares - a big gainer last week and, indeed, in the past month or so - sharply lower. AIB 
stocks fell by 11c to E1.99, Bank of Ireland dropped by 12c to E1.92 and Irish Life and Permanent bucked the trend 
and climbed 20c to E3.75. Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary has sold five million shares, netting E18.75m. In an 
announcement to the Irish Stock Exchange this morning, Ryanair said that O'Leary had sold the shares for E3.75 
each, and that his holding in Ryanair now stands at just over six million shares, or 4.06pc. Earlier this month, 
Ryanair announced a 78pc drop in profits after tax for the year to March 2009, from E480.9m in 2008 to E105m in 
2009. However, revenue increased by 8pc for 2009, from E2.7bn to E2.9bn, with passenger numbers also growing 
by 15pc to stand at 58.5 million people. Ryanair's shares slumped by 14c to E3.61. Aer Lingus stocks dropped by 
4c to E0.62. Total European construction output is expected to decline by 7.5pc in 2009, the biggest year-on-year 
decline on record with Ireland and Spain the worst performers, according to the latest forecasts from Euroconstruct. 
The latest forecasts reflect a sharp deterioration from the outlook given in December, when total output for 2009 
was expected to decline by 4.3pc. Shares in CRH fell by 32c to E17.03. The latest figures from the Builders 
Merchants Federation show that merchanting volumes in the UK declined by 23pc compared to last year in April. 
This represents deterioration on the March figure of -11.3pc. The March reading represented a significant 
improvement on the -28.3pc year on year reported in February and given the improving trends in the macro data 
ISEQ slumps after ratings downgrade ISEQ Falls
(i.e. mortgage approvals etc) and more positive comments from the housebuilders, Goodbody Stockbrokers were

General Meeting of Independent News and Media will be held in the Citywest Hotel on Friday with a stormy debate 
expected. Shares were down less than a cent at E0.26. U.S. stocks slid on Monday after McDonald's warned that 
second-quarter profit could be hurt by currency swings and investors worried that rising interest rates may hamper a 
recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.80 points, or 1.16pc, at 8,661.71. The Standard and Poor's

After one of the best rallies in over a year, the ISEQ slumped yesterday after global ratings agency, Standard and 
Poor's said that it has cut its long-term sovereign credit rating on Ireland to 'AA' from 'AA+'.
The ISEQ fell by 71.84 points to 2,860.44.
S and P cut Ireland's debt rating because it believes the cost to the government of supporting the country's 
struggling banks will be higher than expected. "The rating could be lowered again if asset quality in the Irish 
banking system deteriorates at a faster pace than we expect," S and P said in a statement.
The news sent banking shares - a big gainer last week and, indeed, in the past month or so - sharply lower. AIB 
stocks fell by 11c to E1.99, Bank of Ireland dropped by 12c to E1.92 and Irish Life and Permanent bucked the trend 
and climbed 20c to E3.75. Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary has sold five million shares, netting E18.75m. In an 
announcement to the Irish Stock Exchange this morning, Ryanair said that O'Leary had sold the shares for E3.75 
each, and that his holding in Ryanair now stands at just over six million shares, or 4.06pc. Earlier this month, 
Ryanair announced a 78pc drop in profits after tax for the year to March 2009, from E480.9m in 2008 to E105m in 
2009. However, revenue increased by 8pc for 2009, from E2.7bn to E2.9bn, with passenger numbers also growing 
by 15pc to stand at 58.5 million people. Ryanair's shares slumped by 14c to E3.61. Aer Lingus stocks dropped by 
4c to E0.62. Total European construction output is expected to decline by 7.5pc in 2009, the biggest year-on-year 
decline on record with Ireland and Spain the worst performers, according to the latest forecasts from Euroconstruct. 
The latest forecasts reflect a sharp deterioration from the outlook given in December, when total output for 2009 
was expected to decline by 4.3pc. Shares in CRH fell by 32c to E17.03. The latest figures from the Builders 
Merchants Federation show that merchanting volumes in the UK declined by 23pc compared to last year in April.

The Spanish royal family has slammed an ad by Ryanair saying that Queen Sofia, the Queen Consort of Spain, 
uses the no-frills Irish airline.
It said that Ryanair used a photo of Queen Sofia, who recently flew on the Irish budget airline, without her 
permission.
Ryanair today released an ad with a photo of the wife of King Juan Carlos and the slogan "fly like a monarch."
"It is a privilege for us that Queen Sofia flies with the company that shows the highest growth in Spain, Ryanair," 
said the ad, published in the Spanish national press today. But the royal palace expressed its displeasure with the 
ads. "We are surprised, they did not ask for permission nor did they inform us of the ad campaign," a spokeswoman 
said. "We are looking into it, but there is nothing definite that we can foresee in terms of legal actions or options. 
Nothing has been decided." Queen Sofia flew on Ryanair between the northern city of Santander and London's 
Stansted airport last month to visit her brother Constantine, the former king of Greece, who was to undergo heart 
surgery. The royal palace at the time stressed that the reason was not the low cost, but that the Irish airline offered 
the best option for getting to London on that date.

Aer Lingus is rethinking the fees it pays to non-executive directors, in the face of a government demand for such a 
move.
In a letter to the government, it says a "review" of the matter is taking place.
The news comes just hours ahead of the airline's agm today, at which two motions from 29pc shareholder Ryanair 
will demand cuts in the fees.
The fees are currently 140,000 euro a year to airline chairman Colm Barrington and 36,000 euro to each non-
executive director. Ryanair wants chairman's payment to be cut to 35,000 euro and non-executive directors fees 
reduced to 17,500 euro. News of the review has emerged from a flurry of activity yesterday ahead of the looming 
agm. Also emerging from the flurry was news that transport minister Noel Dempsey has appointed Barrington as 
proxy for the exercise of the government's votes at today's agm. Dempsey had earlier this week rejected an offer 
from Ryanair that he exercise the no frills arline's votes at the meeting. Ryanair chairman Michael O'Leary had 
pointed out that, together with the government's holding, this would give the minister a majority of shareholders' 
votes to force through a cut in directors' fees. The minister has, as it now turns out, gone about the matter in a 
different way. In a letter to Mr Barrington yesterday, the secretary general of the Department of Transport , Julie 
O'Neill, made clear that the minister wanted the airline to reduce the fees paid to the board in light of the current 
economic slump and the company's stated intention to seek further cost-saving measures. "He has asked that I 
convey to you his view that it would be desirable if the board were to review the level of such fees having regard to 
current norms for companies with similar market capitalisation and in similar circumstances to Aer Lingus," Ms 
O'Neill said. Her letter added that the Minister felt that it would be "appropriate in the context of the continuing 
difficult economic climate and the ongoing need to tackle the company's cost base to remain competitive in the 
challenging environment in which Aer Lingus operates" to review the directors' fees. In a reply , Mr Barrington

wrote: "On my behalf and on behalf of the board, I would like to acknowledge the minister for finance's decision to

have been proposed by Ryanair. "I wholeheartedly agree with the suggestion a review be carried out of the level of 
director's fees having regard for current norms for companies with a similar market capitalisation as Aer Lingus." 
The Ryanair motions are now almost certain to be decisively defeated at today's meeting.

Shareholders are expected to press Aer Lingus to explain how it plans to reverse losses that it has said could 
threaten its viability before voting on a Ryanair proposal to cut directors' pay.
With its flights becoming less full and fares falling, the former Irish state airline is under pressure to reduce annual 
fees paid to its board from major shareholder and arch-rival Ryanair at the AGM this afternoon.
The Department of Transport wrote to Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington this week saying that Transport 
Minister Noel Dempsey wanted him to cut pay in the light of the current economic slump and the airline's plans for 
further cost cuts, the Irish Times newspaper said.
A spokeswoman for Aer Lingus said the Irish Times report was correct but would not elaborate. The Department of 
Transport also said it was quoted correctly in the story. The former state carrier has posted two profit warnings this 
year and seen passenger numbers, fares and cash reserves plummet, prompting analysts and trade unions to 
suggest it should be bought or taken back under state ownership. Barrington agreed with the ministry's request in a 
written response to the letter, according to the Irish Times. "I wholeheartedly agree with the suggestion that a 
review be carried out of the level of directors' fees, having regard for current norms for companies with a similar 
scale as Aer Lingus and having regard to the responsibilities of directors of a publicly listed company," Barrington 
wrote. Barrington said that a review was already under way within the context of the company's overall cost-
reduction programme and that the outcome would be announced shortly. Barrington's decision is a victory for 
Ryanair. Ryanair, which has a near 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus, had tabled motions calling for Barrington's 
salary to be cut to E35,000 and non-executive directors' pay to be reduced to E17,500. The chairman's fee is 
E140,000 for 2009, already reduced from E175,000 last year while non-executive directors get E36,000, down from 
E45,000. Ryainair has also said it would ask the airline at the meeting to explain how it planned to reverse its 
losses. Last week, Ryanair offered its votes on the pay issue to the Irish government, which owns around 25 
Turbulent Aer Lingus AGM expected A Lin AGM
percent of Aer Lingus. Minister Dempsey declined Ryanair's offer, which would have given him more than 50 
percent of the votes and enabled him to carry the motions on pay, and instead has appointed Aer Lingus chairman 
Barrington as his proxy to vote on his behalf at the AGM. The letter to Barrington said that the minister had 
"indicated" that his vote "should be cast with the board against these (Ryanair) resolutions", The Irish Times 
reported. "He (Dempsey) has asked that I convey to you his view that it would be desirable if the board were to 
review the level of such fees having regard to current norms for companies with similar market capitalisation and in 
similar circumstances to Aer Lingus," the letter from Julie O'Neill, secretary general of the Department of Transport, 
was quoted as saying. Aer Lingus said separately that its passenger numbers rose by 2.7 percent in May but the 
average flight was less full. It said the load factor declined to 73.7 percent from 76.1 a year earlier and long-haul 
flights ran at only 66 percent capacity. "Clearly Aer Lingus' pricing is under severe pressure - we are forecasting 
average fare declines of 23 percent across the network for full-year 2009," NCB analyst Neil Glynn said in a note. 
"May seems to have been a tough month for revenues given load factor declines across the network and volume 
weakness on long haul." (C ) Reuters

The Dublin shares market began its sixth day in positive territory today despite a worrying downgrade for banks 
from Moody's.
The ISEQ index climbed 25.64 points to 2,907.37 by 12:30.
The index has gained 200 points over the past six days with gains across the board following an impressive May 
showing and strong gains since the start of the year as some appetite for risk returns to the marketplace.
However, today ratings agency, Moody's, has cut Anglo Irish Bank's senior debt rating and four other Irish banks 
were put on review for possible downgrade on concern that the bailout needed might be too much for the 
government. Anglo Irish's long-term deposit and senior debt rating was reduced one step to A3, the fourth-lowest 
investment grade, Moody's said today in a statement. AIB, Bank of Ireland Plc, Irish Life and Permanent and ICS 
Building Society were put on review. "Moody's believes that significant restructuring will be necessary for the bank 
to develop a viable business model again," the agency said in a statement. Shares in AIB rose by 12c to E2.02, 
Bank of Ireland climbed 14c to E1.91 while Irish Life and Permanent declined by 3c to E3.31. Aer Lingus published 
traffic statistics this morning for May. Overall passengers are up 2.7pc yoy, with Short Haul up 6.0pc, but Long Haul 
down 21.1pc. This brings the year to date figures to 0.5pc and -14pc, so presumably the stronger short haul figure 
in May reflects the boost from the London Gatwick base coming on stream recently. In short haul, RPKs (Revenue 
passenger kilometre) was up 11.8pc in the month overall on a 14.9pc uptick in ASKs (available seat per kilometre), 
so load factors eased back by 2.2pc in the month. Year to date, RPKs are +4.0pc in short haul, ASKs are +2.5pc 
and load factors are modestly up by 1pc to 75.5pc. For the full year, we have SH passengers essentially flat, so the 
year to date figure broadly matches that. Goodbody think it should improve over the summer as Gatwick kicks in, 
but then ease back towards flat by year end. Aer Lingus shares were flat at E0.69 while Ryanair edged up 1c to 
E3.78. Having enjoyed a rally at the start of the week on speculation that Bristol-Myers Squibb was interested in the 
ISEQ up again, heads for six-day rally ISEQ Up
company, Elan's share price rose 5pc yesterday on reports that Pfizer may be considering making a bid. This 
company was first mooted as a potential suitor in early January. Since then, it announced the USD67bn acquisition 
of Wyeth, which put pay to the Elan speculation at the time. The latest rumour noted that the approach was to gain 
access to the MS drug Tysabri, which Goodbody Stockbrokers would consider counter-intuitive. Shares in Elan rose 
by 4c to E5.62.

The Dublin shares market began its sixth day in positive territory today despite a worrying downgrade for banks 
from Moody's.
The ISEQ index climbed 25.64 points to 2,907.37 by 12:30.
The index has gained 200 points over the past six days with gains across the board following an impressive May 
showing and strong gains since the start of the year as some appetite for risk returns to the marketplace.
However, today ratings agency, Moody's, has cut Anglo Irish Bank's senior debt rating and four other Irish banks 
were put on review for possible downgrade on concern that the bailout needed might be too much for the 
government. Anglo Irish's long-term deposit and senior debt rating was reduced one step to A3, the fourth-lowest 
investment grade, Moody's said today in a statement. AIB, Bank of Ireland Plc, Irish Life and Permanent and ICS 
Building Society were put on review. "Moody's believes that significant restructuring will be necessary for the bank 
to develop a viable business model again," the agency said in a statement. Shares in AIB rose by 12c to E2.02, 
Bank of Ireland climbed 14c to E1.91 while Irish Life and Permanent declined by 3c to E3.31. Aer Lingus published 
traffic statistics this morning for May. Overall passengers are up 2.7pc yoy, with Short Haul up 6.0pc, but Long Haul 
down 21.1pc. This brings the year to date figures to 0.5pc and -14pc, so presumably the stronger short haul figure 
in May reflects the boost from the London Gatwick base coming on stream recently. In short haul, RPKs (Revenue 
passenger kilometre) was up 11.8pc in the month overall on a 14.9pc uptick in ASKs (available seat per kilometre), 
so load factors eased back by 2.2pc in the month. Year to date, RPKs are +4.0pc in short haul, ASKs are +2.5pc

The index has risen by 250 points over the past six days with gains across the board following an impressive May

Confidence returned amid mounting evidence that the US has passed the worst of the downturn. U.S. employers

The board of Aer Lingus has rejected two resolutions tabled by Ryanair to cut fees paid to the Chairman of Aer 
Lingus and to non-executive directors.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Under the current Board and Irish Government control, Aer Lingus 
shareholders have lost over E1 billion in the value of their shares which have plummeted from over E3 in Jan '07 to 
less than 60c in May '09. Aer Lingus has announced enormous losses in 2008 and has warned of significantly 
increased losses in 2009, and urgently needs to cut costs and lower fares if it is to survive and thrive. Cutting 
bloated Directors' fees (which totalled E730,000 in 2008) to the 2006 levels, is an appropriate place to start, but it 
seems that Colm Barrington and the Minister are more concerned about protecting these fat cat fees than they are

The Irish Examiner reports that Aer Arann will likely go public, according to the airline's chief executive who is not 
ruling out a sale of the company either.
Chief executive Paul Schutz also told the newspaper that Aer Arann will return to profitability next year and will 
likely break even this year.
He had fighting words too for his former Ryanair colleague, Michael O'Leary, who had predicted Aer Arann would 
"go to the wall" last year.
"We're still here and we intend to be here for years to come," he told the Irish Examiner. The chief executive, who 
previously spent six years at Ryanair, said Aer Arann will not carry as many passengers this year as it did last year. 
In 2008 it carried 1.25 million passengers, which was a peak for the airline. This year however it expects that 
number to slip to about 800,000 to 900,000. Aer Arann has not modelled itself as a low cost carrier, instead opting 
not to charge for checked-in baggage or airport check-in. Mr Schutz said the airline operates a niche service and he 
believes Aer Arann can continue to compete with low cost carriers. "We only compete with Ryanair on one route 
and that's the Cork to Dublin service," he said. He did not rule out ever selling the airline to Ryanair or any other 
interested airline. "We will talk to anybody about selling but it's a matter for the shareholders but nobody is buying 
airlines at the moment," he said. Mr Schutz said Aer Arann is also looking at re-introducing the early and late 
Cork/Dublin flights. "We are looking very hard at bringing back the morning and evening services but we cannot 
operate at Ryanair's fares. If the route does return it must be supported... if it's not used it will disappear and it won't 
come back again," said Mr Schutz.

Chief executive Paul Schutz also told the newspaper that Aer Arann will return to profitability next year and will 
likely break even this year.
He had fighting words too for his former Ryanair colleague, Michael O'Leary, who had predicted Aer Arann would 
"go to the wall" last year.
"We're still here and we intend to be here for years to come," he told the Irish Examiner. The chief executive, who 
previously spent six years at Ryanair, said Aer Arann will not carry as many passengers this year as it did last year. 
In 2008 it carried 1.25 million passengers, which was a peak for the airline. This year however it expects that 
number to slip to about 800,000 to 900,000. Aer Arann has not modelled itself as a low cost carrier, instead opting 
not to charge for checked-in baggage or airport check-in. Mr Schutz said the airline operates a niche service and he 
believes Aer Arann can continue to compete with low cost carriers. "We only compete with Ryanair on one route 
and that's the Cork to Dublin service," he said. He did not rule out ever selling the airline to Ryanair or any other 
interested airline. "We will talk to anybody about selling but it's a matter for the shareholders but nobody is buying 
airlines at the moment," he said. Mr Schutz said Aer Arann is also looking at re-introducing the early and late 
Cork/Dublin flights. "We are looking very hard at bringing back the morning and evening services but we cannot 
operate at Ryanair's fares. If the route does return it must be supported... if it's not used it will disappear and it won't 
come back again," said Mr Schutz.

The ISEQ made further tentative progress as the markets saw new hope in US economic data and overlooked 
downbeat comments from the ECB.
The index climbed 29.53 points to 2,8817.73.
The ECB said it expected a much sharper recession this year in the euro zone than earlier forecast, unveiling 
details of how it will pump cash into the economy while it kept interest rates on hold.
The forecasts predicted the euro zone economy would now shrink by up to 5.1 percent this year and signalled it 
would also struggle to grow in 2010 - forecasting a change in GDP of between -1 percent and +0.4 percent. But 
U.S. data showing lower jobless claims and a stronger-than-expected rise in productivity helped support investment 
following a strong rally. Bank of Ireland has announced the completion of its tender offer for four separate 
securities, paying out a combined E520m for paper with a nominal value of E1.26bn. This will generate a gain of 
E740m pre-tax. When account is taken of likely gains on two further dollar-denominated securities, the bank is 
confident of generating an equity gain (i.e. after tax) of about E1bn. This compares with a current market cap of 
E1.8bn using the current share count. It also compares with the E700m that Davy have pencilled into its model. 
Shares in Bank of Ireland fell by 4c to E1.7, AIB edged up 2c to E1.90 despite profit taking after a sustained rally 
and Irish Life and Permanent dropped by 6c to E3.34. Elsewhere, W. Hamburger has confirmed the closure of its 
120,000 tonne recycled containerboard mill in Hungary in advance of the opening of its new 400,000 plant, 
scheduled to start production on July 1st. The closure, which had been indicated previously, further improves the 
supply-demand dynamics of the European containerboard sector, said Davy. However, Smurfit Kappa shares fell by 
31c to E3.94. Ryanair released May traffic statistics. Passengers are up 9pc compared to the same month last year 
to 5.51 million and the load factor is up one percentage point to 81pc. Regarding forecasts, Goodbody Stockbrokers 
said it was hoping that it would be better than this on the passenger numbers front. Shares in the no-frills airline

were up 3c at E3.73. Aer Lingus edged up 1c to E0.72. Shares in Newcourt were suspended yesterday after a 
receiver was appointed after the group broke its banking covenants. The stock was worth E0.04, having fallen by 
well over 90pc in the past year. Shares in Dragon Oil jumped 43c to E4.30. Dragon provided the latest results from 
the ongoing drilling programme in Cheleken (offshore Turkmenistan) yesterday, which outlined that a rate of 3,554 
barrels of oil per day from well LAM 28/134 had been achieved. "The result is positive in that this is the second well 
drilled on the refurbished LAM 28 platform with a rate in excess of 3,000 barrels a day achieved in both cases," said

Shares in Swedish banks fell sharply yesterday after Latvia failed to sell 50m lats ($100.5m) worth of treasury bills, 
raising fears of a possible devaluation of the Latvian currency.
Swedbank  and SEB are heavily exposed to the Baltic region, which has been hit particularly hard by the global 
recession. Latvia, one of the three Baltic states, has tapped the International Monetary Fund for emergency aid.
Exposure to the Baltic region accounts for 12 per cent of SEB's and 16 per cent of Swedbank's loan books, 
according to Ben May at Capital Economics. Both lenders have launched rights issues in the past year in the face 
of mounting Baltic region losses. Swedbank fell 15.9 per cent to SKr38 yesterday, following a 5.6 per cent drop on 
Tuesday. Shares in Sweden's fourth-largest bank have fallen 68.6 per cent in the past year.
SEB was the largest faller on the FTSE Eurofirst 300. Sweden's third-largest bank by market capitalisation fell 11 
per cent to SKr30, adding to losses of 3.4 per cent on Tuesday.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 2 per cent to 868.1. Germany's Xetra Dax was down 1.7 per cent to 5,054.53 while 
France's CAC 40 fell 2 per cent to 3,309.65.
Banks were lower as traders said the large demand for capital raising among banks in the UK, the US and 
throughout Europe had halted the gains made by banking stocks in the past few months.
Spain's Banco Santander fell 2.8 per cent to EUR7.53 and BBVA  lost 3.4 per cent to EUR8.54. Italy's Banco 
Popolare  was down 4 per cent to EUR5.66. In Germany, Deutsche Bank fell 3.9 per cent to EUR46.41 and 
Commerzbank  fell 2.5 per cent to EUR5.50. DnB NOR , Norway's largest bank by market value, lost 8.15 per cent 
to NKr53.
Bucking the trend, Dexia  rose 6.9 per cent to EUR5.40, building on an 11.9 per cent gain in the previous session.
Ryanair  shares gained 4.6 per cent to EUR3.70. RBS raised Ryanair's price target to EUR4.25 from EUR4 with a 
"buy" rating.

The government has declined an offer of proxy votes from Ryanair's Michael O'Leary for a decision on directors' 
fees at Aer Lingus, according to a report this morning.
O'Leary had offered the votes to transport minister Noel Dempsey to use at the airline's agm this coming Friday.
The Irish Times says that, in a letter sent yesterday, Mr Dempsey has politely declined Ryanair's "kind offer".
Firday's meeting will be asked to vote on two motions from Ryanair seeking to cut the fees paid to the Aer Lingus 
directors, and executive compensation for loss of office. If the minister had accepted the offer to act as Ryanair's 
proxy, he would have held a majority of Aer Lingus's votes on the matter. According to the paper, the minister's 
letter says: "While I would certainly be interested in having control of Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus - to use 
in the best long-term interest of the shareholders, the company and consumers - I am really not interested in short-
term, limited control of the shares solely to vote for resolutions proposed by Ryanair at the agm. "As you appear to

Low-cost carrier has further to climb

Michael O'Leary's group has outpaced Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, writes Kevin Done
Body
So far the recession has been good for Ryanair and its iconoclastic chief executive, Michael O'Leary.
In the space of 15 years as chief, he has taken a small lossmaking airline from the fringes of Europe and built it into 
the world's second most valuable carrier by market capitalisation, after Singapore Airlines.
In the past 12 months, he has overtaken both Air France-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa to become the biggest 
European short-haul carrier, measured by passenger numbers. And, in the depth of the recession, he is stretching 
his lead.
As most carriers in Europe cut capacity, Ryan-air continues to add aircraft, confident that with the lowest costs in 
the industry it can continue to drive down fares, gain market share and fill its growing number of seats.
The results for the past financial year to the end of March, reported yesterday, were ravaged by the huge surge in 
the oil price in the early months of last year, and the plunge in Ryanair's financial performance was exacerbated by 
its badly mistimed fuel hedging.
It also ended the financial year with its first net loss since flotation in 1997 as a result of writedowns on its 29.8 per 
cent stake in Aer Lingus, bought as part of its abortive takeover attempts in the past two years.
Mr O'Leary paid a total of EUR407m (m$583) for the stake and by the end of March, following the collapse of the 
smaller Irish carrier's share price, he had been forced to write down its value to only EUR93m after a writedown of 
EUR222m last year.
Meanwhile, the fabled low-cost airline business model of Ryanair is again demonstrating that it can develop robustly 
during a recession. Even with a 59 per cent increase in fuel costs last year and an 8 per cent drop in average fares, 
the group stayed in profit at an underlying level.
Low-cost carrier has further to climb
To the discomfiture of rivals, Mr O'Leary is keeping the throttle wide open. Ryanair has led the lowcost airline 
revolution in Europe. It did not invent the business model, which originated in the US with Herb Kelleher's 
Southwest Airlines. But it has implemented it with unmatched zeal and discipline.
He has forced the traditional full-service network airlines to change the way they do business in short-haul markets 
and, without the Ryanair cost base, they struggle to compete in point-to-point flying.
The immediate outlook is promising. Mr O'Leary forecast yesterday that underlying net profits would at least double 
to between EUR200m and EUR300m this year. The flipside of having made bad hedging decisions in the previous 
two years is that Ryanair was free to lock in relatively low fuel prices for much of the current financial year.
Mr O'Leary is still driving down non-fuel costs as he squeezes airport and handling costs around Europe, and has 
locked in reduced prices for acquiring new aircraft
According to a leading aviation analyst, Ryanair still has ample scope for growth.
Southwest has a fleet of more than 500 jets and handles more than 100m passengers a year in a market with a 
population of about 300m. Ryanair is half the size and the European market has 500m people.

Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, fell into loss last year, its first deficit since flotation 12 years ago, 
under the impact of its abortive attempts to take over Aer Lingus, its smaller local rival.
Its underlying profits fell heavily, as it was hit by the surge in the fuel price in the first half of 2008 and by mistimed 
fuel hedging.
But Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, forecast underlying profits would more than double this year - in stark 
contrast to expected continuing losses at several leading European network carriers.
The Irish carrier is one of the few European airlines growing strongly during the recession while most of the industry 
cuts capacity.
Mr O'Leary forecast a 15 per cent rise in passenger volumes in the 12 months to the end of March 2010 to 67m and 
said the group expected to "at least double" its underlying net profits to between EUR200m and EUR300m ($286m-
$429m).
Its share price closed 9 cents or 2.5 per cent lower at EUR3.54 after a 23 per cent rise in the past three months.
The plunge in the Aer Lingus share price during the last year forced Ryanair to take a EUR222.5m write-off on the 
value of its 29.8 per cent stake, which helped to transform an operating profit of EUR144m, before exceptional 
charges, to a pre-tax loss of EUR180.5m, down from a pre-tax profit of EUR438.9m a year earlier.
Excluding the Aer Lingus impairment charges and a EUR51.6m accelerated depreciation charge for the sale of 
older aircraft, underlying net profits fell by 78 per cent in the year to the end of March from EUR480.9m to 
EUR105m. Turnover rose by 8 per cent from EUR2.7bn to EUR2.9bn, while passenger numbers rose by 15 per 
cent from 50.9m to 58.5m.
Average fares fell by 8 per cent to EUR40; Mr O'Leary forecast a further steep fall this year by 15-20 per cent to 
about EUR32.
Ryanair falls into loss
Ryanair has taken advantage of lower oil prices to restart hedging and said it was 90 per cent hedged for the first 
three quarters of the coming year "at much lower prices than competitors" at about $620 a tonne.
Mr O'Leary said he expected a EUR450m fall in the full-year fuel bill, which jumped last year by 59 per cent or 
EUR499m to EUR1.3bn.
It raised its ancillary revenues by 23 per cent to 20 per cent of turnover.
Mr O'Leary said in-flight mobile phone services were expected to make "a meaningful contribution" to ancillary profit 
growth.

Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus was a case of folie de grandeur . Were it not for the EUR223m write-off on the value of 
its almost 30 per cent Aer Lingus stake, Ryanair would have turned a profit last year . Meanwhile, most other 
European airlines have been losing money hand over fist, leaving Ryanair the continent's biggest by market value.
This has become the latest boasting point of Michael O'Leary, chief executive, who has long used Ryanair's low-
cost platform to berate just about everyone else. This has included "clueless" regulators; passengers who balk at 
being treated like cattle but still keep coming back; and competitors, the latest being Lufthansa after a particularly 
grandiose suggestion from Mr O'Leary that he could almost buy the German carrier "for cash".
Yet this grandstanding has always been just a marketing tool to highlight the growth and ruthless cost-cutting of 
Ryanair. While other airlines are shrinking capacity in the downturn, he is increasing the size of Ryanair's fleet by 
15 per cent. With some 90 per cent of the coming year's fuel bill hedged at $62 a barrel, Mr O'Leary's forecast rise 
in net profit to EUR300m for the coming year looks conservative, especially as it factors in a 15 to 20 per cent drop 
in passenger yields.
"Low cost always wins," as Mr O'Leary says, and it is telling that he increasingly compares Ryanair with other 
budget-conscious companies, such as Ikea, rather than airlines. Nonetheless, his model remains Southwest, the 
US domestic carrier. It began low cost operations 20 years before Ryanair, serving a market half the size, building a 
fleet now more than twice as big. Southwest's growth has only lately reached its limits. Mr O'Leary will be able to 
boast for years yet.

While many airline chiefs claim to be fighting for survival, Ryanair is sticking to pre-recession forecasts, writes Kevin 
Done
Body
So far the recession has been good for Ryanair and its iconoclastic leader Michael O'Leary.
In the space of 15 years as chief executive, he has taken a small lossmaking airline from the fringes of Europe and 
has built it into the world's second most valuable carrier by market capitalisation, after Singapore Airlines.
In the past 12 months it has overtaken both Air France KLM and Germany's Lufthansa - British Airways was left in 
the slipstream long ago - to become the biggest European short-haul carrier, measured by passenger numbers. 
And in the depth of the recession, it is stretching its lead.
As most carriers in Europe cut capacity, Ryanair is still adding more aircraft, confident that with the lowest costs in 
the industry it can continue to drive down fares, gaining market share to fill its   rising number of seats.
The results for the financial year to the end of March, reported yesterday, were ravaged by the surge in the oil price 
early last year, and the plunge in Ryanair's financial performance was exacerbated by its own mistimed fuel 
hedging.
It ended the financial year with its first net loss since flotation in 1997 as a result of writedowns on its 29.8 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus, bought as part of its abortive takeover attempts in the past two years.
Mr O'Leary is hardly infallible. He paid a total of EUR407m for the Aer Lingus stake and, following a EUR222m 
writedown with these results, it is now worth just EUR93m (£80.7m).
But Ryanair's low-cost airline business model is again demonstrating it can develop robustly during recession. Even 
with a 59 per cent rise in fuel costs last year and an 8 per cent drop in average fares, the group stayed in profit at 
an underlying level.
O'Leary looks to skies as he keeps throttle open
To the discomfiture of rivals Mr O'Leary is keeping the throttle open. Ryanair has led the low-cost airline revolution 
in Europe. It did not invent the model, which originated in the US with Southwest Airlines, but it has implemented it 
with unmatched zeal and discipline.
The immediate outlook is promising. Mr O'Leary forecast yesterday that underlying net profits would at least double 
to between EUR200m and EUR300m this year. The flipside of having made bad hedging decisions in the previous 
two years is that Ryanair was free to lock in relatively low fuel prices for much of the current financial year, when the 
oil price plunged in recent months.
Mr O'Leary is also still driving down non-fuel costs as he squeezes airport and handling costs around Europe, and 
he has locked in reduced prices for acquiring new aircraft thanks to the strength of the euro against the dollar.
With one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, Ryanair has also secured financing for new aircraft to 
September 2010.
While many airline chief executives claim they are fighting for survival in the worst trading conditions they have ever 
faced, Mr O'Leary was confidently sticking yesterday to prerecession forecasts that Ryanair would double its profits 
and passenger numbers between 2007 and 2012.
He has also scheduled talks with Boeing for the late summer on another big aircraft order for 200-300 jets for 
delivery between 2013 and 2016.
According to a leading aviation analyst Ryanair still has scope for growth under the Southwest model.
Liberalisation of the US domestic airline industry happened almost 20 years earlier than in Europe. The US carrier 
has a fleet of more than 500 Boeing 737s and handles more than 100m passengers a year
Ryanair as yet is only half the size and the European market has a population of 500m. "It has a lot of runway 
ahead of it," says the analyst.

Highlight: Aer Lingus bid drags down results
O'Leary upbeat on future profitability
Body
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, fell into loss last year, its first deficit since flotation 12 years ago, 
under the impact of its abortive attempts to take over Aer Lingus, its smaller local rival.
Its underlying profits also fell heavily, as it was hit by the surge in the fuel price in the first half of last year and by 
mistimed fuel hedging moves.
However, chief executive Michael O'Leary forecast that underlying profits would more than double this year, in stark 
contrast to expected losses at several leading European network carriers including British Airways and Air France-
KLM.
The Irish carrier is one of the few European airlines that is continuing to grow strongly during the recession, while 
most of the industry cuts capacity.
Mr O'Leary forecast a 15 per cent rise in passenger volumes in the 12 months to the end of March 2010 to 67m and 
said the group expected to "at least double" its underlying net profits to a range of EUR200m (£173m) to EUR300m.
Its share price closed 9 cents, or 2.5 per cent, lower at EUR3.54 after a 23 per cent rise in the past three months.
The plunge in the Aer Lingus share price during the past year forced Ryanair to take a EUR222.5m write down on 
the value of its 29.8 per cent stake, which helped to transform an operating profit of EUR144m, before exceptional 
charges, to a pre-tax loss of EUR180.5m, down from a pre-tax profit of EUR438.9m a year earlier.
Excluding the Aer Lingus impairment charges and a EUR51.6m accelerated depreciation charge for the sale of 
older aircraft, underlying net profits fell 78 per cent, from EUR480.9m to EUR105m.
Turnover increased 8 per cent from EUR2.71bn to EUR2.94bn, while passenger numbers rose 15 per cent from 
50.9m to 58.5m.
Ryanair plunges to EUR180m loss
Average fares fell 8 per cent to EUR40 last year and Mr O'Leary forecast a further steep decline this year by 15 to 
20 per cent to about EUR32.
Ryanair has taken advantage of significantly lower oil prices to restart hedging, and said it was 90 per cent hedged 
for the first three quarters of the coming year "at much lower prices than competitors" at about $620 a tonne.
Mr O'Leary said he expected a EUR450m fall in the full-year fuel bill, which last year jumped 59 per cent, or 
EUR499m, to EUR1.3bn.
Ryanair raised its ancillary revenues, from sources such as commission earnings from hotel, car rental and travel 
insurance bookings, by 23 per cent.

Body
Ryanair reported a full-year net loss for the first time on Tuesday, chiefly because of losses from its investment in 
rival carrier Aer Lingus.
But Europe's biggest budget airline said lower fuel costs and ruthless price-cutting would keep its aircraft packed 
and would drive a profits rebound this year despite the challenge of recession at home and abroad.
The Dublin-based carrier said it lost €169 million ($239 million) in the year ended March 31 compared with a €391 
million profit in the previous fiscal year.
Ryanair shares fell 2.5 percent to close at €3.54 on the Irish Stock Exchange.
The company said it fell into the red chiefly because of a €222.5 million accounting write-down on its 30 percent 
stake in Aer Lingus, whose stock has fallen 70 percent since its 2006 privatization. Ryanair has pursued two failed 
takeover bids and expects eventually to swallow its smaller Irish rival.
Accounting rules require Ryanair to record the Aer Lingus stock falls as a loss, even though Ryanair says it has no 
intention of selling its stake at current depressed prices.
Richard Hunter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London, said Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus 
"has proved to be something of an albatross around the company's neck."
Ryanair also suffered a €51.6 million writedown on the value of its fleet, reflecting lower aircraft prices 
internationally.
Excluding those two exceptional paper losses, Ryanair earned €105 million ($148 million) in the year ending March 
31, down 78 percent from €481 million in the previous fiscal year.
The airline said its sales rose 8 percent to €2.94 billion and the number of passengers booked rose 15 percent to 
58.5 million.
Ryanair suffers 1st full-year loss, sees rebound
Its fuel costs surged 59 percent to €1.26 billion, representing 45 percent of total costs.
Analysts slated Ryanair for getting its fuel-purchasing policies wrong in 2008, shunning advance delivery contracts 
as oil surged towards record highs and paying too much as prices slumped in the second half of the year.
But Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline has already purchased advance fuel-delivery contracts 
for 90 percent of its needs through the end of 2009 at much lower prices.
O'Leary said the airline's expected fiscal 2010 net profits would rebound to a range of €200 million to €300 million.
He said the company planned to keep its planes as full as possible by discounting average fares by 15 to 20 
percent and recouping profits by selling its passengers "extras," including on-board food, car rentals and package 
holidays.
"Lower fares will help Ryanair to grow traffic, maintain high load factors and despite a deep recession gain traffic 
from high-fare competitors," O'Leary said.

Body
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said a disastrous upcoming winter for airlines would play into the low-cost 
carrier's hands despite its first annual loss in 20 years, as rivals predicted doomsday scenarios.
In a press conference punctuated with sideswipes at other carriers, O'Leary predicted Ryanair's passenger 
numbers would rise significantly in the current year, despite the downturn in air travel.
"Next winter could be terrible. We are gearing up for it to be terrible. There will be a bloodbath in the industry, and 
we want to cause some of that bloodbath," he told reporters, adding that the outlook for Ryanair was "bloody 
brilliant".
Ryanair posted a net annual loss of E169.2 million after writing down the value of its stake in Aer Lingus, and 
though it disappointed the market with conservative forecasts, it said it still expected a substantial profit in the 
current year. O'Leary's comments laid down the gauntlet to rivals such as British Airways, which refused to make a 
profit forecast at its full-year results last month and said it saw no signs whatsoever of a recovery. In a bid to explain 
the severity of the situation to staff, BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh told the company newspaper the airline faced 
a "fight for survival" and asked staff to take redundancy or unpaid leave. In Tokyo, Virgin Atlantic founder Richard 
Branson told Reuters the current crisis for airlines would take at least one major scalp in the United States. "I just 
happen to believe it is unlikely that all the big American carriers will survive the next 12 to 18 months," he said. 
Ryanair, which prides itself on its no-frills, bottom price tickets around Europe, is forecasting a profit of E200-300 
million in the year to March 2010, while BA and Virgin are both expected to make heavy losses. Ryanair's O'Leary 
said fares were likely to fall 15-20 percent in the year to March 2010 -- a sign that demand will also fall -- but that 
Ryanair's overall passenger numbers were set to hit 67 million, up from 58.5 million at the end of March. This is 
ahead of all other European carriers, and O'Leary said the airline's growth could one day even enable it to buy 
Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa. "We are having a serious look at Lufthansa. We could almost buy it for cash," 
Rivals predict doom, Ryanair swaggers on Ryanair Predict
Michael O'Leary told a news conference in London following Ryanair's full-year results. "We are not planning any 
bids for Lufthansa in the foreseeable future, but it is the only one of the other three large airlines that we would be 
interested in." A spokesman for Lufthansa decline to comment, though analysts said it would be impossible to carry 
out. But O'Leary said he would not look at buying British Airways under any circumstances. The UK carrier has half 
the passenger numbers of Ryanair despite generating three times as much revenue. "British Airways is just a 
pension deficit with wings," O'Leary said, adding that business class, which in the past has made up much of BA's 
profits, was "dead". (C ) Reuters

Highlight: Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said a disastrous upcoming winter for airlines would play into 
the low-cost carrier's hands despite its first annual loss in 20 years, as rivals predicted doomsday scenarios.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said a disastrous upcoming winter for airlines would play into the low-cost 
carrier's hands despite its first annual loss in 20 years, as rivals predicted doomsday scenarios.
In a press conference punctuated with sideswipes at other carriers, O'Leary predicted Ryanair's passenger 
numbers would rise significantly in the current year, despite the downturn in air travel.
"Next winter could be terrible. We are gearing up for it to be terrible. There will be a bloodbath in the industry, and 
we want to cause some of that bloodbath," he told reporters, adding that the outlook for Ryanair was "bloody 
brilliant".
Ryanair posted a net annual loss of E169.2 million after writing down the value of its stake in Aer Lingus, and 
though it disappointed the market with conservative forecasts, it said it still expected a substantial profit in the 
current year. O'Leary's comments laid down the gauntlet to rivals such as British Airways, which refused to make a 
profit forecast at its full-year results last month and said it saw no signs whatsoever of a recovery. In a bid to explain 
the severity of the situation to staff, BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh told the company newspaper the airline faced 
a "fight for survival" and asked staff to take redundancy or unpaid leave. In Tokyo, Virgin Atlantic founder Richard 
Branson told Reuters the current crisis for airlines would take at least one major scalp in the United States. "I just 
happen to believe it is unlikely that all the big American carriers will survive the next 12 to 18 months," he said. 
Ryanair, which prides itself on its no-frills, bottom price tickets around Europe, is forecasting a profit of E200-300 
million in the year to March 2010, while BA and Virgin are both expected to make heavy losses. Ryanair's O'Leary 
said fares were likely to fall 15-20 percent in the year to March 2010 -- a sign that demand will also fall -- but that 
Ryanair's overall passenger numbers were set to hit 67 million, up from 58.5 million at the end of March. This is 
ahead of all other European carriers, and O'Leary said the airline's growth could one day even enable it to buy 
Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa. "We are having a serious look at Lufthansa. We could almost buy it for cash," 
Rivals predict doom, Ryanair swaggers on; Ryanair Predict
Michael O'Leary told a news conference in London following Ryanair's full-year results. "We are not planning any 
bids for Lufthansa in the foreseeable future, but it is the only one of the other three large airlines that we would be 
interested in." A spokesman for Lufthansa decline to comment, though analysts said it would be impossible to carry 
out. But O'Leary said he would not look at buying British Airways under any circumstances. The UK carrier has half 
the passenger numbers of Ryanair despite generating three times as much revenue. "British Airways is just a 
pension deficit with wings," O'Leary said, adding that business class, which in the past has made up much of BA's 
profits, was "dead". (C ) Reuters

Body
The Dublin shares market, having been closed on Monday, raced ahead today, bucking the European trend as 
investors played catch-up.
The index climbed 95.51 points to 2,818.03.
European shares declined, led lower by banks as traders said Abu Dhabi had sold about £3.5 billion of shares in 
Barclays, while investors also pointed to profit taking after Monday's rally.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.2pc at 884.61 points after briefly turning positive. 
Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 1.2pc, Germany's DAX was down 0.1pc and France's CAC was down 
0.5pc. Barclays plunged 13.8pc as traders said Abu Dhabi government-owned International Petroleum Investment 
Company (IPIC) sold about £3.5 billion of shares in the British bank at 267 pence each, a 16 percent discount to 
Monday's close. Back home, shares in Ryanair fell by 9c to E3.54 after it posted its first loss in 20 years. However, 
taking in to account the slowdown in the global aviation sector, fuel prices that were 60pc higher and the Aer Lingus 
investment write-down, Ryanair's results today were "good", according to Davy Research analyst, Stephen Fulong. 
He said that Ryanair beat its own net profit guidance, which was for between E50m and E80m and topped Davy's 
forecast of E77.6m. "These are good results in a sector context and with the airline's fuel costs up almost 60pc," Mr 
Furlong said. He pointed out that Ryanair continues to have a very strong balance sheet with cash of E2.3 billion. 
Shares in Aer Lingus gained 5c to E0.70. Food group, Aryzta, saw its stocks surge by 25c to E20.90 after it 
reported group revenues for the nine months to April 25 last that rose 7pc to E2.43 billion and said it is on track to 
post in-line full year earnings. The group, formed following the merger of IAWS and Swiss bakery group Hiestand, 
said it remains on target to achieve average earnings per share of E2.14 for the year. Origin Enterprises, the fresh 
foods group that is 71.4pc owned by Aryzta, today posted a 9.2pc rise in revenues in the nine months to the end of 
April last to E1.15 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange rate movements revenues

were 5.6pc lower. Food generated revenue for the period of E226.8 million, a reduction of 13.4pc. Excluding the 
impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange rate movements revenues were 3pc lower. Its shares rose by 11c to 
E2.16. Elsewhere, banks helped to push the index sharply higher with AIB gaining 24c to E1.49, Bank of Ireland 
climbed 8c to E1.78 and Irish Life and Permanent rose by 13c to E3.50. The costs of the banking crisis keep 
stacking up. With another E4 billion to be pumped into the nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, the total cost to the 
Government has now risen to E11 billion (with the E7 billion injection into Bank of Ireland and AIB). When the IMF 
released its estimates of the costs of banking crisis in individual countries in April it was rounded upon by a whole 
host of countries, including Ireland and the UK, for being overly pessimistic on prospects. US construction spending 
rose 0.8pc year-on-year in April, well ahead of consensus estimates which indicated that a fall of 1.5pc was likely. 
US construction stocks rose strongly as a result with the aggregates majors Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta 
gaining 7.9pc and 5.2pc respectively. Shares in CRH jumped by E1.03 to E17.63.

The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.2 percent at 884.61 points after briefly turning 
positive. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 1.2 percent, Germany's DAX was down 0.1 percent and 
France's CAC was down 0.5 percent. Barclays plunged 13.8 percent as traders said Abu Dhabi government-owned 
International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) sold about £3.5 billion of shares in the British bank at 267 
pence each, a 16 percent discount to Monday's close. Back home, shares in Ryanair fell by 3c to E3.60 after it 
posted its first loss in 20 years. However, taking in to account the slowdown in the global aviation sector, fuel prices 
that were 60pc higher and the Aer Lingus investment write-down, Ryanair's results today were "good", according to 
Davy Research analyst, Stephen Fulong. He said that Ryanair beat its own net profit guidance, which was for 
between E50m and E80m and topped Davy's forecast of E77.6m. "These are good results in a sector context and 
with the airline's fuel costs up almost 60pc," Mr Furlong said. He pointed out that Ryanair continues to have a very 
strong balance sheet with cash of E2.3 billion. Shares in Aer Lingus gained 5c to E0.70. Food group, Aryzta, saw its 
stocks surge by 35c to E21.00 after it reported group revenues for the nine months to April 25 last that rose 7pc to 
E2.43 billion and said it is on track to post in-line full year earnings. The group, formed following the merger of 
IAWS and Swiss bakery group Hiestand, said it remains on target to achieve average earnings per share of E2.14 
for the year. Origin Enterprises, the fresh foods group that is 71.4pc owned by Aryzta, today posted a 9.2pc rise in 
revenues in the nine months to the end of April last to E1.15 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, disposals

and exchange rate movements revenues were 5.6pc lower. Food generated revenue for the period of E226.8 
million, a reduction of 13.4pc. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange rate movements 
revenues were 3pc lower. Its shares fell by 3c to E2.03.

Body
Ryanair has posted a 78pc fall in full-year adjusted earnings to 105m euro, and said it plans to at least double that 
in 2009/10, contrasting the bleak outlook of rivals.
Adjusted net profit for Europe's biggest low-cost carrier for the year to the end of March was ahead of the airline's 
guidance, and above the 35.7m euro average forecast in a poll of 13 analysts by Reuters Estimates.
However, after writing down 222.5m euro for the fall in the value of its stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus and 51.6m euro 
for accelerated depreciation on aircraft disposals, Ryanair made a loss of 180m euro before tax and 169m euro 
after tax.
"In this recessionary environment we intend to continue to offer European consumers... better value just like Aldi, 
Lidl, IKEA and McDonald's are doing in their respective industries," chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a 
statement. Unlike competitors like British Airways which last month said tough conditions made it impossible to give 
guidance, Ryanair said it expected to grow after-tax profit in this fiscal year to a range between 200 - 300m euro. 
Ryanair increased its passenger numbers by 15 percent in 2008/09 to 58.5m and plans to grow that further to 67m 
this year by cutting average fares by between 15 to 20 percent, it said. In contrast to its former Irish takeover target 
Aer Lingus which has repeatedly warned in recent months of risks to its long-term viability, Ryanair said its 2.3bn 
euro cash pile was still rising. "All of our major competitors have reported material reductions in short-haul capacity 
and traffic," O'Leary said. "Ryanair will continue to lower fares to stimulate traffic growth, maintain high load factors 
and win more short-haul traffic from our high fare competitors." Ryanair claimed that it became the largest airline in 
Europe in March 2009 by both passenger numbers and marjet capitalisation. It says it carried 67m passengers in 
the previous 12 months, compared to Lufthansa's 56m, 52m at Air France and 33m at British Airways. It also said 
its market capitalisation was 5.3bn euro at 1 May, more than any of the others. Average fares fell by 8pc to 40 euro, 
but this was largely funded by a 3pc reduction in non fuel operating costs. Ancillary revenues grew by 23pc to 598m

euro. "We have now achieved our target of 20pc of revenues one year ahead of schedule," it said. "Our onboard 
mobile telephony service trial commenced at the end of February and is now available on over 40 aircraft based in 
Ireland and Italy. "Early indications prove that consumers love this service and penetration rates continue to rise. 
"While initial revenues will be small, we believe that in-flight communications will make a meaningful contribution to 
ancillary profit growth in future years if this trial proves successful." Fuel costs rose by 466m euro (59pc) to 1.257bn 
euro and accounted for 45pc of operating costs, up from 37pc a year earlier. "We have taken advantage of recent 
falls in jet fuel prices to extend our hedging programme for FY'10 to 90pc for the first 3 quarters at an average price 
of approx. USD 620 per tonne and 5pc of Q4 at approx. USD 490 per tonne," it said. "Assuming that we hedge the 
balance of our fuel requirements at current rates this would reduce our fuel bill by approx. 450m euro in FY'10. 
"Excluding fuel, other operating costs fell by 3pc on a per passenger basis."

Body
(RTTNews) - Dublin, Ireland - based low-cost airline operator Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported 
Tuesday a loss for fiscal year 2009 that reflects a 59% increase in fuel costs as well as impairment charges, despite 
growth in revenues. Looking ahead, the company currently expects profit for fiscal 2010 to be at least double to a 
range between 200 million euros and 300 million euros.
Loss for the year attributable to equity holders of parent was 169.17 million euros or 11.44 eurocents per share, 
compared to a profit of 390.71 million euros or 25.62 eurocents per share in the previous year.
Loss before tax was 180.49 million euros, in comparison with a profit of 438.93 million euros in the prior year.
Results for the year include exceptional items of 274.1 million euros, compared to 90.2 million euros in the 
preceding year. The company recorded an impairment charge of 222.5 million euros on its Aer Lingus shareholding, 
reflecting the decline in the Aer Lingus share price from 2 euros per share at March 31, 2008 to 0.59 euros per 
share at March 31, 2009.
Exceptional items also include an accelerated depreciation charge of 51.6 million euros on aircraft disposed in the 
financial year 2008 and 2009 and for agreements to dispose of aircraft in the financial year 2010 as well as a gain 
of 12.1 million euros in the year ended March 31, 2008 on aircraft disposed in fiscal 2008.
Excluding exceptional items, adjusted earnings were 104.95 million euros or 7.08 eurocents per share, down from 
480.93 million euros or 31.53 eurocents per share last year.
Total operating revenues grew 8% to 2.94 billion euros from 2.71 billion euros in the earlier year. Scheduled 
revenues increased to 2.34 billion euros from 2.22 billion euros in the year earlier. Ancillary revenues grew by 23% 
to 598.1 million euros from 488.13 million euros a year ago.
Total revenue per passenger decreased by 6% and there was a decline in load factor by 1 point to 81%.
Average fares during the year declined by 8% due to the shift of Easter in the year, weaker euro/sterling exchange 
rates and aggressive fare promotions.
Total operating expenses for the year increased by 29% to 2.79 billion euros from 2.16 billion euros last year, 
mainly due to the increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity and increased costs associated with the growth 
of the airline.
Ryanair Holdings Posts Loss in FY09 - Update
Fuel costs grew by 59% to 1.257 billion euros due to the higher cost of fuel during the period and a 13% increase in 
the number of hours flown.
Operating margin declined by 15 points to 5% and operating profits decreased by 74% to 144.2 million euros.
The company said it generated cash from operating activities of 413.1 million euros and a further 314.2 million 
euros from the sale of 16 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which funded the higher fuel costs.
Capital expenditure of 702 million euros during the year consisted of advance aircraft payments for future aircraft 
deliveries and the delivery of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the company noted.
Staff costs during the year increased by 11%, primarily due to a 21% increase in average employee headcount.
The company's net debt at the end of the year was 120.2 million euros, compared to a net debt of 96.9 million euros 
in the prior year.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2010, the company expects to grow traffic by 15% to 67 million. The company also expects 
operating costs per passenger, excluding fuel, to fall by about 5% and intend to use these reductions in both fuel 
and other unit costs to drive fares materially lower.
On the basis of these fuel and yield expectations, the company currently expects after tax profits for the coming 
year to be at least double to a range of between 200 million euros and 300 million euros.
RYA.L is currently trading at 3.58 pence, down 0.09 pence or 2.47%, on a volume of 5.95 million shares.
RYAAY is currently trading at $30.56, up $0.27 or 0.89% on a volume of 288K shares.

Ryanair to cut fares again as profits slide

Budget airline Ryanair's full year resultys were rocked as the group pursued a policy of aggressive price 
competition to attract passengers during the downturn and took a hit related to the doomed bid to buy out rival Aer 
Lingus and as oil prices weighed.
Shares fell 20 cents, or 5.56%, to 3.44 after the numbers as the group reported a net loss of 169 million (£146 
million), down from a profit of 391 million a year earlier.
Ryanair said pretax profits were down 78% to 105 million (£90.5 million) as it cut fares by 8% and as fuel costs rose 
59% to 1,257million. The figure still beat its earlier forecast of 50-80 million.
Revenues rose by 8% to 2,942 million (£2,54 millin) boosted by ancillary revenues which grew 23% to 598 million.
The group said revenues for add-ons such as luggage in the hold and fees for using mobile telephones have now 
reached the group target of 20% of revenues - up from 18% a year earlier.
Ryanair has now grown to be the Europe's largest airline having overtaken Air France, BA and Lufthansa's 
passenger numbers and market capitalisation, it said.
Ryanair has written down its 29.8% stake in the rival Irish airline by 222 million to a value of just 93 million saying 
this reflects Aer Lingus' year end share price of just 59 cents.
'We remain deeply concerned about the future of Aer Lingus which continues to lose traffic, suffer rising losses and 
falling cash balances under a board which has shown it has no vision and no strategy for improving shareholder 
value,' Ryanair said.
'Despite the global recession and record high oil prices Ryanair's lowest fare/lowest cost airline services again 
delivered traffic growth and profitability which demonstrates the fundamental strength of the Ryanair model,' said 
chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Ryanair said it expects average fares to drop by 15-20% this year as it hopes to boost traffic by another 15%.
It currently expects that after tax profits for the coming year will at least double to a range of between 200-300 
million.

Taking in to account the slowdown in the global aviation sector, fuel prices that were 60pc higher and the Aer 
Lingus investment write-down, Ryanair's results today were "good", according to Davy Research analyst, Stephen 
Fulong.
He said that Ryanair beat its own net profit guidance, which was for between E50m and E80m and topped Davy's 
forecast of E77.6m.
"These are good results in a sector context and with the airline's fuel costs up almost 60pc," Mr Furlong said.
He pointed out that Ryanair continues to have a very strong balance sheet with cash of E2.3 billion. Net debt was 
up to E120.2m. On financing, Ryanair mentions that it is now fully financed for the next 16 months having recently 
completed the financing of 45 aircraft which will be delivered between October 2009 and September 2010 at very 
competitive rates. "The key variable in the guidance is yield, which Ryanair assumes will fall 15-20pc over the year. 
The ex-fuel cost story continues to be very impressive, guiding down 5pc. Fuel savings of E450m have been 
broadly locked in with hedging now extended to 90pc of Q1-Q3 and 5pc for Q4," he added.

Highlight: On the first morning of the China Airfinance conference, delegates were told that Chinese banks will 
increase their lending activity and look to finance aircraft internationally, as the aviation centre of gravity shifts from 
West to East.
Body
China is an expanding aviation market, but Chinese banks will have to increase their lending activity, delegates 
were told at the seventh annual China Airfinance conference.
"There will be a shift from the West to the East over the next several decades," said chairman Garry Burke, CEO, 
Pembroke in his opening remarks at the Beijing conference.
With one out of every 10 aircraft in the order backlog ordered by a Chinese airline, the country is becoming 
increasingly more important in the aviation market. Not only will airlines play a greater role in the development of 
the sector over the years, but Chinese banks will increase their lending activity and look to finance aircraft 
internationally.
During his presentation, Li Xiaopeng, executive vice president, ICBC, said that Chinese banks would help to fill the 
estimated $13.5 billion funding gap. He said financing airlines outside of China was "fruitful and providing 
successful profits".
ICBC has participated in a secured transaction with Southwest Airlines in the second quarter of 2009. As chairman 
of ICBC Leasing, the bank's wholly-owned aircraft leasing subsidiary, Xiaopeng said the company's goal is to 
become the "best domestic leasing company and a leading international leasing company." He remains confident in 
aviation and says that the corrections that the market is feeling does not change the bank's view on the industry.
The morning's airline panel demonstrated the pains yet perseverance of Chinese airlines. While many are feeling 
capital constrained, they continue to look to raise finance, though mainly domestically.
As relations between China and Taiwan have eased over the last year, China Airlines is looking forward to 
expanding its direct network into mainland China. Wei Wang, general manager, finance division, China Airlines, 
said that profitability is good on these routes, and the airline will increase direct flights from 22 to 55.
She pointed out that its hard to find finance at the moment and in order to be attractive to investors, airlines will 
have to increase their equity to get more capital, which will give the airline more bargaining power with the banks.
Exclusive from Beijing conference
Chen Ke, CFO, Spring Airlines, said that his airline, the first low cost carrier in China, will need to raise capital over 
the next few years, and it will look to do so by launching an initial public offering in the next year or two.
Though the airline has raised much of its financing through 2009, Ke said that Spring's shareholders would inject 
money into the airline if needed. The carrier, which is modeled after Southwest Airlines, Ryanair and AirAsia, has 
had a load factor of 95% since 2005 according to Ke. Spring will look to increase its auxillary charges to get through 
the financial crisis.
But it was Air China's CFO Fan Cheng who called on the Chinese banks to develop new financing products to help 
finance aircraft. State-owned airlines have been receiving government aid for the past several months, but finance 
is necessary for both the private and publicly owned airlines.

VHI reports  65 million deficit
Health insurer VHI has reported a deficit of  65 million for the ten months to the end of December.
The firm's latest financial results contrast with a surplus of almost  63 million for the year to February 2008.
''This deficit arose because VHI Healthcare is paying out almost  30 million more than it has received in premium 
income in meeting its customers' medical care needs, combined with losses of  43 million on our investment 
portfolio," said a VHI statement.
The firm said it paid out an average of  775 for each customer last year, which it claimed was up to  400more than 
its rivals.
VHI chief executive Jimmy Tolan said that the current difficult economic environment would also affect membership 
levels this year.
Ryanair launches credit card offer
Ryanair has launched an online credit card offer with zero interest on balance transfers for ten months. Most credit 
card issuers offer only a six month interest-free period. Ryanair will charge a variable annual percentage rate of 
14.9 per cent once the promotional period has expired.
The Ryanair offer, available via MBNA Ireland, also gives customers a return flight to a European destination of 
their choice. Customers can access a 24-hour customer helpline and online banking service to transfer balances, 
view statements and monitor recent transactions.
The airline first began offering credit card services in 2002.
Consumer agency lauds multi-unit bill
Loose Change
The National Consumer Agency (NCA) has welcomed the publication of the Multi-Unit Developments Bill as ''a 
major step forward'' in the protection of consumers living in apartments.
''With more and more consumers living in multi-unit developments, we have long been aware of the need for 
regulation," said Ann Fitzgerald, chief executive of the NCA. ''The publication of this bill represents a good day for 
consumers.
She said that many apartment dwellers had found themselves in a difficult position due to poor operation and 
management of their developments. ''The bill will empower them to have a greater say in the way in which their 
developments are managed and administered," Fitzgerald said.
The bill deals with a number of areas, such as voting rights, management committees, sinking funds and common 
areas.
Rabo Direct cuts savings rate
Online bank Rabo Direct has cut the interest rate on its personal savings account again. Since last Thursday, a rate 
of 2p er cent applies to all balances in demand personal savings accounts. Previously, a rate of 2.25 per cent was 
paid.
''The rate decrease is again in response to the European Central Bank [ECB] changes earlier this month, which saw 
the rate dropped to 1 per cent. Although our rate has decreased, Rabo Direct still remains 100 basis points above 
the current ECB rate," said Roel van Veggel, general manager of Rabo.
New funds from Hibernian Aviva
Irish investors have access to a range of new energy and exploration investment funds from Hibernian Aviva.
The funds were launched last week in a partnership arrangement between Hibernian Aviva and global fund 
manager BlackRock. Retail investors will be able to invest in a range of funds from BlackRock, covering gold, new 
energy, world energy and mining.
The fund management firm, which was founded more than 20 years ago, has almost $1.3 trillion in assets under 
management.
The four funds being made available are authorised by the Financial Regulator and will be available with a minimum 
investment of  10,000 for single premium or from 150 a month for regular investors.
Taxpayers feeling legal bite
Recent legislation may leave some taxpayers facing public and costly court proceedings, according to a leading 
advisory firm.
William FryTax Advisors said the introduction of a new civil penalty regime last year had changed the penalty 
provisions for making mistakes, and introduced a new court procedure for disputes on Revenue penalties.
The firm said this meant that, when a dispute arose that involved a penalty of  38,092o r more, the dispute would be 
publicly aired in the High Court, with the taxpayer incurring possible costs of more than  100,000.
''This new legislation is very powerful and broad," said Sonya Manzor, partner with William Fry Tax Advisors. ''There 
are not sufficient checks and balances to protect the compliant taxpayer who makes a mistake that is picked up in a 
Revenue audit. The compliant taxpayer now faces a Catch 22 situation - pay the penalty and suffer, or challenge it 
in open court and face significant costs and publicity."
House prices fall another 1.9%
Loose Change
The latest house price index from Permanent TSB and the Economic and Social Research Institute has revealed 
that house prices fell a further 1.9 per cent in April. Prices nationally have fallen by almost 5 per cent since the start 
of the year, bringing house prices back to 2004 levels.
The average price paid for a house nationally last month was  248,640, compared with  261,573 in December and a 
peak of  311,078 in February 2007. Prices of first-time buyer properties dropped at the fastest rate, with houses in 
this category worth 7.9 per cent less now than at the start of 2009. The average price paid by a first time buyer last 
month was  206,530, compared with  224,153 last December.
BoI Life launches two new funds
Bank of Ireland Life has launched two medium-term fixed-return funds. The 20 per cent Return Fund and the 10 per 
cent Return Fund provide lumpsum customers with an alternative to deposits, with capital protection on their 
original sum at maturity.
''Recent market volatility has seen investors flock to short-term deposit accounts - and understandably so, given the 
limited options available to the cautious investor," said Brian Grimes, head of investments for Bank of Ireland Life. 
''However, it is important to remember that short-term deposit rates may not offer the best return for all investors.

Ryanair offers its Aer Lingus vote at agm to the government
Ryanair offers its Aer Lingus vote at agm to the government

Aer Lingus shareholders hoping for a showdown over directors' pay at this week's agm received a setback last 
Friday, when Ryanair, the airline's biggest investor, signalled it would not cast a vote on resolutions it had gone to 
great lengths to table.
Instead, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary invited transport minister Noel Dempsey to vote on the airline's 
behalf, a move that will add Ryanair's 29 per cent stake to the government's 25 per cent holding and allow 
Dempsey, if he so wishes, to control the outcome of the votes in question. The motions tabled by Ryanair will seek 
to cut the pay of Aer Lingus executive chairman Colm Barrington and the airline's non-executive directors.
They will be put to a shareholder vote after Ryanair won a legal row between the two airlines in recent weeks over 
its right to propose the motions at the agm. Aer Lingus has dismissed both motions and advised shareholders to 
vote against them.
Dempsey, however, is unlikely to use the extra power handed to him by O'Leary. While the Ryanair boss said that 
appointing Dempsey as proxy aimed to ''expose the hypocrisy'' of the Aer Lingus board, the government has stuck 
to a policy of backing management and refusing to be seen to interfere in the commercial decision-making process.
As the government has never voted against a recommendation of the Aer Lingus board, and the same board has 
urged shareholders to reject the two motions proposed by Ryanair at this week's agm, O'Leary's attempts to curb 
director pay are unlikely to succeed. The rejection of the two motions, however, will spare O'Leary the legal 
complications of being seen to use his 29 per cent stake to influence Aer Lingus decisions.
Attempts to force Ryanair to dispose of its stake on competition grounds have stalled, as O'Leary has been able to 
make a convincing case that Ryanair exerts no control over Aer Lingus.
He said the latest opposition to a Ryanair initiative was the fifth time in two years that his airline had been unable to 
force Aer Lingus to follow one of its recommendations.

Ryanair has, however, succeeded in blocking resolutions at previous agms that needed 75 per cent majorities.
These have been technical in nature, however, and relate to preventing the dilution of existing shareholders' 
interests through the issue of new shares.

Merrion Pharmaceuticals, the Dublin listed drug maker, has made major progress in its plans to launch a 
blockbuster cancer drug in tablet form for the first time.
Chief executive John Lynch will today outline ''very positive'' results from second-phase trials of its Orazol drug at 
the gathering of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Florida. Lynch said the firm was ''very, very pleased'' 
with the results, which proved the effectiveness of the tablet form of a drug that is currently only available as an 
injection.
Merrion is now looking for a partner for the phase-three development and launch of the drug, which treats bone 
breakdown in people with advanced cancers.
Drug giant Novartis sells the injectable form of the drug, which had sales of $1.65 billion last year.
Lynch said the tablet form would save patients and healthcare providers time and money by cutting the need for 
hospital visits. Merrion is developing oral forms of several injectable drugs and has partnership deals worth a total 
of $116 million with insulin specialist Novo Nordisk.
The firm, which counts Declan Ryan of Ryanair as a major investor and director, is quoted on the IEX in Dublin and 
AIM in London with a market capitalisation of about  69 million. It employs about 30 people and is ''looking to grow'', 
according to Lynch.

end of the tunnel for the crisis in their sector.
Body
Irish banks managed to make gains on the Dublin market today on a belief that there is now light at the end of the 
tunnel for the crisis in their sector.
All three locally quoted banks managed to advance on the last trading day of the month.
AIB ended 7c higher at 135, representing a rise of 5 pc, while Bank of Ireland rose by 14c, or 9pc, to 170. Irish Life 
& Permanent was up 8c, or 2pc, at 337.
The market overall advanced just marginally, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares ending 3.01 points higher on the 
day at 2,694.22. The gains for the banks came on a day when Anglo Irish Bank wrote down a massive 4.1bn euro 
in dodgy loans , and warned that its eventual bill for doubtful lending could reach 7.5bn euro. The writeoff wiped out 
most of the bank's 4.9bn euro in equity and reserves, which no longer has a quote on the Dublin market. However, 
finance minister Brian Lenihan played fairy godmother with an announcement, issued simultaneously with the 
bank's results, that the state will inject up to 4bn euro into it to shore up its balance sheet. Investors did try to un-
pick the details of the Anglo bad debt figures, caused overwhelmingly by lending to developers, and particularly the 
bank's warning that there are more writeoffs to come in this department in the worsening market conditions. And 
why wouldn't they because worsening market conditions could also mean growing writeoffs in other banks too? The 
worsening state of the market was also underlined by new Central Bank figures showing that homeowners are now 
paying off their mortgages faster than banks are issuing new loans. The total amount owed on residential 
mortgages is now falling for the first time since records began in 1990. But, despite the worsening market, the 
overwhelming feeling today was that the minister's pledge of 4bn euro to Anglo was another major step towards 
sorting out the banking sector. With the NAMA legislation promised for summer, investors are now seen to be 
discounting the current market, and look increasingly prepared to take a punt on a brighter future. Ryanair remained 
flat today on 360 as investors mulled whether it remained good value, given that its current price exceeds market 
Banks up as Anglo bailout cheers market Banks Rise
projections. Dolmen analyst David Dunk said investors rather than market analysts had it right, and he increased 
his price target for the airline to 383. Providence Resources was unmoved at 4, despite the wrap being lifted just a 
little on the very large Droombeg gas prospect in the Porcupine Basin off the west coast, where it hold a 16pc 
stake. Exxon Mobil came on board as operator of the prospect last year and, although it has given no details of long 
offset seismic surveys it has recently completed, some encouragement is being taken from the energy giant 
referring to the prospect as a "key" event in its exploration story. Big movers today included building materials giant 
CRH, which dropped 18c to 1660, and United Drug, down 6c to 186.

Over 100 passengers missed their flights this morning due to a half-kilometre long queue at the security barriers at 
Dublin Airport, Ryanair said today.
The airline called on the newly appointed DAA Chairman, David Dilger, to address the "appalling service levels" at 
the airport.
Ryanair confirmed that the DAA failed to staff all security points on time with just 8 out of 17 security units open at 
5am, the start of the busiest time of the day at Dublin Airport. Ryanair also confirmed that abysmal service levels at 
the DAA monopoly's Dublin Airport are due to the re-deployment of staff, which are paid for by passengers and 
airlines, to replace "lollypop men" at the construction site for the extravagant T2.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Dublin Airport has experienced a substantial fall in passenger numbers due to 
the high costs imposed by the DAA monopoly and passengers, who pay dearly to pass through one of Europe's 
most expensive airports, continue to be exposed to the worst service levels of any of the 146 airports Ryanair 
operates from. As we face into the traditionally busier summer months we are calling on newly appointed DAA 
Chairman David Dilger to address the abysmal service levels at the monopoly run Dublin Airport."

Body
The Dublin shares market rose sharply today, boosted by a strong showing from its three banks and from Ryanair.
Their performance helped the ISEQ index of Irish shares to close 50.74 points higher at 2,748.52.
Shares in AIB climbed by 6c to 134, Bank of Ireland rose by 11c to 161 and Irish Life & Permanent took on 29c to 
329.
IL&P was helped by reports that its insurance arm Irish Life is close to agreeing a distribution of its products through 
Ulster Bank's 140 retail branches in the Republic of Ireland. Under the deal, Irish Life would apparently be the 
bank's sole provider of life products, something that would . further increase the insurer's existing 37pc dominance 
in the life market in Ireland. Shares in Ryanair jumped by nearly 8pc or 26c to 355, as it smashed through its 200-
day moving average relative to the index in mid-November last year. The break-out was extremely significant, 
according to Davy Stockbrokers' analyst Ivan Skelly, "considering the fact that the 200-day moving average had 
loomed large over the stock, providing a formidable resistance barrier, since January 2004". The no-frills carrier has 
now outperformed the FTSE Eurofirst index by an impressive 83.8pc this year so far "As expected, the stock 
continued its strong out-performance since making this breakout," Skelly said, "and is now closing in on its previous 
relative high, recorded in April 2003. "The stock looks set to test this previous high with a sustained break- through 
at this level, providing a very bullish long-term signal." C&C shares jumped by 67c to 228 after reports that it is to 
cut the price of a Bulmers Irish Cider pint bottle by 10pc in the Irish on-trade market as it takes on its competitors in 
a shrinking market. "This is not a surprise and we view the move positively," said Davy. "We believe new 
management has being considering this action since it took over the role." Shares in small-cap Newcourt fell by 1c 
to 4 - a 20pc drop - after it confirmed that it has been approached about a possible buyout of its recruitment arm. It 
says the managing director of its Sigmar operation, Adrian McGennis, has suggested buying some or all of this 
business. "No discussions have yet taken place in relation to the possible terms of any such offer, nor has any

formal proposal been received," it says. Newcourt, which is also involved in security, training and facilities 
management, employs 3,200 people in Ireland and its shares have lost over 80pc in value in the past year. Shares 
in build materials supplier CRH fell by 38c to 1757, despite news that the pace of sales of existing homes in the US 
rose 2.9pc in April. The news supported the view that the three-year US housing recession was near a bottom. The 
National Association of Realtors said sales climbed to an annual rate of 4.68 million units from a downwardly 
revised 4.55 million pace in March, initially reported as 4.57 million. That was slightly higher than market 
expectations for a 4.66 million-unit pace.

Royal Festival Hall
Body
The last time Christy Moore played the Festival Hall - "this room", he called it, familiarity shrinking it into intimacy - 
was more than 20 years ago, in honour of Ken Livingstone.
The cheer he got for a mention of the Greater London Council, the body "Red Ken" used to head, might have 
seduced a lesser performer into nostalgia. Sometimes Moore succumbed. "Missing You" found an Irish labourer 
adrift in Piccadilly Circus, prevented from going home by "the price of a flight", as if Ryanair had never existed. "No 
Time For Love", which slyly conflates Irish Republicanism with the Anti-Apartheid Movement, had acquired some 
"women fighting scabs at the factory gates", a prospect now so distant that it might have been life on Mars.
But "Ordinary Man", about factory closures as the bosses walk away rich, resonated as soundly as ever. With its 
parade of slavers and football fans, "Does This Train Stop On Merseyside?" crystallised Liverpool's mixture of 
truculence and guilt.
Moore was accompanied by Declan Sinnott, the two of them sitting in tiny pools of light amid the darkness. (For 
"Ride On" and "The Cliffs Of Dooneen" the audience added a 2,000-strong choir.) Together, they wove past and 
present into one compelling narrative.
"Don't Forget Your Shovel" started out so bewhiskered that its hate figure was Enoch Powell, industrial archaeology 
in a London whose expatriate Irish are accountants and IT professionals. But it morphed satirically into Daniel 
O'Donnell (a bland countryman of Moore's) receiving an MBE from Prince Charles and a fantasia (one presumes) 
about the Duchess of Cornwall recalling a night of passion with Sinnott at Glastonbury.
Shockingly up to date, after a recent report into child abuse in Ireland, was Joni Mitchell's "The Magdalene 
Laundries", recalling the oubliettes into which the Irish Church and state decanted women who ranged from fallen to 
inconvenient. At the end, another 1970s flashback came in the form of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", which 
Christy Moore
revealed itself as a meditation. "Come on, you martyr to truth and delusion", sang Moore, half to himself, "and 
shine". *****

The Dublin shares market fell steeply this morning as Europe's shares dropped, led lower by financials and 
commodity stocks after a reported missile launch by North Korea unsettled markets.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 53.37 points to 2,640.00.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.7 percent at 842.77 points after closing 0.2 
percent higher on Monday. The index is on track for its third day of falls in the last four sessions. Across Europe, 
Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were down 1.5-2.3 percent.
Bank shares fell sharply with AIB down 13c to E1.17, Bank of Ireland declined by 16c to E1.34 and Irish Life and 
Permanent lost 17c to E2.83. Uncertainty over NAMA continued to give financial sector investors the jitters. A report 
in the media suggests that the magnitude of the haircuts that Irish banks will take on the transfer of their property-
related loans (up to E90bn in total) to NAMA will be determined in July. The report quotes Finance Minister Brian 
Lenihan: 'we will know the extent of the write-downs by the time of the enactment of the legislation'. The legislation 
is expected to be ready in July and, if it is not enacted before the Dail recess (on July 2nd), the government has 
indicated it is prepared to recall the Dail over its summer recess to expedite the process. Shares in food group, 
Greencore, fell nearly 10pc or 11c to E1.04 after it reported a pre-tax loss of E27m for the six months to March 27, 
2009 compared to a pre-tax profit of E24m the same time last year. Revenues for the six-month period fell from 
E649m to E550m in what the company called a challenging trading environment. The group said that a 17pc fall in 
the value of sterling against the euro knocked E5.7m off operating profits. About 80pc of its total operating profits 
are sterling dominated. Since last August, Ryanair has outperformed the FTSE Eurofirst index by a massively 
impressive 83.8pc. This move saw the stock smash through its 200-day moving average relative to the index in

through at this level, providing a very bullish long-term signal. Shares in the airline fell by 3c to E3.28. Aer Lingus 
was down 1c to E0.67. Rockwool, a Danish competitor of Kingspan in the building insulation business, saw its 
share price fell 3pc after the group issued a disappointing set of first quarter results. Kingspan's shares declined by 
7c to E4.55.

The Dublin shares market fell steeply in the morning before rebounding in the afternoon amid renewed hopes in the 
US that the recession will be short-lived.
U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq gaining 3pc, after data from an industry group showed that 
consumer confidence rose in May, boosting optimism that the recession may be abating, and a broker upgrade of 
Apple lifted technology stocks.
Back home, bank shares put in a lacklustre performance with AIB down 2c to E1.28, Bank of Ireland was flat at 
E1.50 and Irish Life and Permanent was unmoved at E3.00.
Uncertainty over NAMA continued to give financial sector investors the jitters. The State could end up losing no 
money from the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), Brendan McDonagh, NAMA's 
interim managing director told a Dail Committee on Finance and Public Service today. However, he said it was not 
possible yet to determine what discount will be applied to loans to be transferred to the agency from banks. He told 
the Committee that the agency would have to work with institutions outside the State guarantee scheme, as some 
developers had loans with many banks. He said that E60 billion in loans and between E20 billion and E30 billion of 
collateral assets would be transferred to NAMA. Shares in food group, Greencore, fell nearly 10pc or 11c to E1.04 
after it reported a pre-tax loss of E27m for the six months to March 27, 2009 compared to a pre-tax profit of E24m

was up 2c to E0.70. Rockwool, a Danish competitor of Kingspan in the building insulation business, saw its share 
price fell 3pc after the group issued a disappointing set of first quarter results. Kingspan's shares rose by 10c to 
E4.72. Shares in Dragon Oil, which has oil projects in Turkmenistan, jumped by 10c to E3.23. The ongoing fall-out 
between the Turkmen Government and Gazprom over apportioning blame to the cause of an explosion on the main 
gas pipeline that feeds gas north into Russia before winding its way back down to Europe would appear, despite 
Russian assertions to the contrary, to have hardened. Shares in FBD fell by 8c to E7.11. The Spanish national 
statistics office reported data on Spanish hotels for April on Friday. It showed a continued decline in occupancy

The Dublin shares market fell steeply in the morning before rebounding in the afternoon amid renewed hopes in the 
US that the recession will be short-lived.
U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq gaining 3pc, after data from an industry group showed that 
consumer confidence rose in May, boosting optimism that the recession may be abating, and a broker upgrade of 
Apple lifted technology stocks.
Back home, bank shares put in a lacklustre performance with AIB down 2c to E1.28, Bank of Ireland was flat at 
E1.50 and Irish Life and Permanent was unmoved at E3.00.
Uncertainty over NAMA continued to give financial sector investors the jitters. The State could end up losing no 
money from the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), Brendan McDonagh, NAMA's 
interim managing director told a Dail Committee on Finance and Public Service today. However, he said it was not 
possible yet to determine what discount will be applied to loans to be transferred to the agency from banks. He told 
the Committee that the agency would have to work with institutions outside the State guarantee scheme, as some 
developers had loans with many banks. He said that E60 billion in loans and between E20 billion and E30 billion of 
collateral assets would be transferred to NAMA. Shares in food group, Greencore, fell nearly 10pc or 11c to E1.04 
after it reported a pre-tax loss of E27m for the six months to March 27, 2009 compared to a pre-tax profit of E24m 
the same time last year. Since last August, Ryanair has outperformed the FTSE Eurofirst index by a massively 
impressive 83.8pc. This move saw the stock smash through its 200-day moving average relative to the index in 
mid-November last year. The break-out was extremely significant, Davy said, considering the fact that the 200-day 
moving average had loomed large over the stock, providing a formidable resistance barrier, since January 2004. As 
expected, the stock continued its strong out-performance since making this breakout and is now closing in on its 
previous relative high, recorded in April 2003. The stock looks set to test this previous high with a sustained break-

through at this level, providing a very bullish long-term signal. Shares in the airline fell by 2c to E3.29. Aer Lingus 
was up 2c to E0.70. Rockwool, a Danish competitor of Kingspan in the building insulation business, saw its share 
price fell 3pc after the group issued a disappointing set of first quarter results. Kingspan's shares rose by 10c to 
E4.72. Shares in Dragon Oil, which has oil projects in Turkmenistan, jumped by 10c to E3.23. The ongoing fall-out 
between the Turkmen Government and Gazprom over apportioning blame to the cause of an explosion on the main 
gas pipeline that feeds gas north into Russia before winding its way back down to Europe would appear, despite 
Russian assertions to the contrary, to have hardened. Shares in FBD fell by 8c to E7.11. The Spanish national 
statistics office reported data on Spanish hotels for April on Friday. It showed a continued decline in occupancy 
across all categories of hotels, with lower budget (3 star) outperforming hotels at the higher end (5 star). FBD has 
two hotels in Spain, La Cala resort and golf courses, which is 5 star, and the 3 star Sunset Beach Club aparthotel.

Body
With the London market on a public holiday, Dublin's ISEQ had a quiet day with very low trading volumes.
The ISEQ fell by 4.61 points to 2,693.37.
Nationalised Anglo Irish Bank is due to report interim results to the end of March 2009 as early as today or as late 
as Thursday. Media reports suggest that impairment losses in the half may be as high as E4bn, substantial in the 
context of the bank's E73bn loan book at end-September 2008. A report in the papers this morning quotes Finance 
Minister Brian Lenihan as saying that the institution's losses were 'somewhat beyond expectations.' As in the case 
of the other Irish lenders, the most vulnerable segment of the loan book is the property development piece, 
although impairments on the business banking book can also be expected to increase.
Shares in AIB edged down 3c to E1.30, Bank of Ireland gained 4c to E1.50 while Irish Life and Permanent was flat 
at E3.00. The six Irish covered institutions are expected to have provided detail to the government of the 
development property loan books by today, in preparation for the set up of NAMA. This will allow the exposures of 
these institutions to the top 50-75 developers to be collated. Shares in Elan fell by 3c to E5.02 after its US partner, 
Biogen Idec's latest weekly update on Tysabri carries a report of a recent PML (disease of the brain) case in the 
US, the second such case in the region and the seventh confirmed case overall in the nearly three years since the 
re-launch of the product. The patient was being treated for MS and had received 24 doses of Tysabri. Five of the 
seven confirmed cases have been on the drug for 12-24 months, and all have been on Tysabri for over 12 months. 
As of March 2009, some 24,900 patients had received over 12 months of Tysabri exposure. 52,000 patients have 
been exposed to Tysabri since re-launch. Shares in Aer Lingus fell by 3c to E0.68 while Ryanair was up 1c to 
E3.31. Oil prices could spike to beyond the near USD150 record high of 2008 within two to three years unless the 
industry invests in new projects to expand capacity, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Monday. The 
influential minister of the world's top oil exporter said the industry faced "faltering demand and significantly lower 
ISEQ edges down led by CRH ISEQ Down
prices" but that the market reflected the global economic downturn rather than being an indicator of things to come. 
"We are maintaining our long-term focus rather than being swayed by the volatility of short-term conditions," he said 
in prepared remarks to the G8 energy summit in Rome. With the US dollar reaching USD1.40 last week the impact 
of adverse currency movements moves back up the agenda again for CRH. If such a rate were to persist for the 
remainder of the year, US profits (accounting for about 48pc of group profits) would be translated at an average 
exchange rate of USD1.36, which Goodbody says would impact profits by about 4pc. CRH shares fell by 16c to 
E17.71.

Aer Lingus was forced into a legal U-turn after initially rejecting two resolutions proposed for its upcoming agm by 
Ryanair, the former state airline's largest shareholder, correspondence between the airlines reveals.
Aer Lingus company secretary Dermot Moriarty threw out Ryanair's original request to add the two resolutions - 
proposing to cut the pay of Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington and the other non executive directors - to the agm 
notice.
''We have not included your proposed resolutions on the agm agenda'', Moriarty said in a letter dated April 30. 
''Your resolutions represent an attempt to interfere with matters which . . . are properly reserved to the company's 
remuneration committee.
Furthermore, as our largest competitor, it is not appropriate for you to seek to influence matters which impact upon 
the recruitment and retention of directors and senior managers by the company."
But a response from Ryanair company secretary Juliusz Komorek, issued the following day, said directors' pay was 
an item of ordinary business and that shareholders ''have every right'' to propose a resolution on the subject. He 
warned that Ryanair would apply to the High Court to force Aer Lingus to comply with its requests if necessary.
In a letter on May 6, Moriarty said the right to propose such resolutions only applied to shareholders ''who actually 
attend the meeting''.
If Ryanair representatives attended the meeting, and propose resolutions, Moriarty said, ''you will be free to do so to 
the extent permitted by law''.
In further correspondence on May 12,Moriarty said Ryanair ''will be permitted'' to put the resolutions to the meeting, 
but said it was ''entirely inappropriate'' to seek to dictate the pay of Aer Lingus directors. Ryanair's attempts to 
submit a third resolution, relating to payments to departing executives, were unsuccessful, however.
Aer Lingus makes U-turn on Ryanair resolutions
Aer Lingus rejected Ryanair's request as it said the proposed motion was ''anticompetitive'' and did not constitute 
ordinary business. Ryanair said it would still attempt to raise the issue at the agm.

Leslie Buckley
AGE: 64
APPEARANCE:
fit, smiley, but not to be messed with
NEWSWORTHINESS:
having recently joined the board of Independent News & Media, he has now been appointed to the board of Aer 
Lingus
Leslie Buckley has run eight marathons during his lifetime and, as he prepares to roll up his sleeves for his new 
roles on the boards of Independent News & Media (INM) and Aer Lingus, one might think that he is about to run the 
corporate equivalent of a few more.
Buckley - a Denis O'Brien appointee to the board of INM and a government appointee to the board of Aer Lingus - 
has been getting under the bonnets of companies since the 1980s.At 64, he will regard the challenges associated 
with his latest two directorships with eagerness. Neither of them will be a doddle.
Buckley and his fellow O'Brien appointees, Lucy Gaffney and Paul Connolly, went straight in at the deep end with 
INM.
A  200 million bond repayment fell due last week, and the company failed to raise the money in time to pay it. 
Weeks of negotiations with bondholders bore enough fruit to give the company a 'standstill' agreement until June 
26.This basically means that they have agreed not to pull the trigger on the debt and declare the company in 
Les'll fix it
default. INM will hope that, in the meantime, its plans to sell assets will place it in a better position to reach a new 
agreement with bondholders later in the summer.
But not everything augurs well. The negotiations went down to the wire on the granting of a standstill deal, never 
mind a longer-term resolution of the issue. At the same time, INM announced it had agreed with its bankers to 
borrow an additional  15 million in working capital.
It is far from clear what this money is for, but it is not a healthy sign that the media group, with 2008 turnover of  1.4 
billion, has had to pledge fresh security to its bankers to get its hands on  15 million in working capital.
Negotiations are also taking place between INM and its bankers over a  560 million bank facility that is due for 
repayment next year. Critics of O'Brien's choice of INM directors argue they don't know anything about the 
newspaper business.
However, sources say they haven't even got around to talking about newspapers yet, as the more immediate 
balance-sheet challenges dominate proceedings.
Over at Aer Lingus, it's no bed of roses either. The company is forecasting losses this year, and can dig itself out of 
difficulty only if radical cost-cutting and restructuring take place. That will be difficult with the state and staff as major 
shareholders, not to mention Michael O'Leary's Ryanair circling in the background.
People who know Buckley say he is very direct and sees things in straightforward terms. ''If something needs to 
happen, or needs to change, then Leslie will tell it straight and say, 'This is how it is going to be'," said one 
businessman who has worked with him in the past.
Described variously as a corporate restructuring specialist and company doctor, Buckley sees his contribution to 
businesses as using his experience to make whatever decisions have to be made. In a magazine interview eight 
years ago, he described what he did at firms as ''highlight the fact that the company is in difficulty, and make the 
shareholders and senior management face up to facts''. Similar medicine maybe required at INM and Aer Lingus.
When it comes to Buckley's CV, the fact that he has worked in so many places is a major plus. When restructuring 
consultancy work is included alongside his fulltime positions, he has worked at Agra Trading, Monaghan 
Mushrooms, Jefferson Smurfit Group, Telecom Eireann, Esat, Iarnród Eireann, Irish Steel, Waterford Crystal, Esat, 
E-Power, Digicel, Saongroup, ICAN and several other firms.
Two influential figures in his business career have been O'Brien and Michael Smurfit. Buckley worked as a 
production manager in Jefferson Smurfit's corrugated division on the Ballymount Road in Dublin.
One day, he got a phone call from Smurfit, who had just become chairman of the newly-formed Bord Telecom 
Eireann.
The paper and packaging magnate wanted him to become his personal assistant at the state telecommunications 
board.
The job ended up with Buckley acting as Smurfit's eyes and ears, and introduced him to corporate life for the first 
time. Buckley is not sure why Smurfit chose him for the job, but the fact that he had had ten work stoppages at his 
corrugated plant in the previous 12 months could have been a factor; it was certainly possible to interpret in several 
different ways.
After Buckley had left Smurfit and Agra Trading, there followed a stint at Monaghan Mushrooms. He then decided to 
set up his own consultancy firm in 1990.
O'Brien asked him if he would ''take a look under the bonnet'' at his 98FMradio station. Buckley said he would 
spend one day a week at it for six weeks, and hasn't stopped working with O'Brien since. He was there at the start 
of Esat Telecom, and sat on its board. He was also a co-founder of Digicel, O'Brien's Caribbean mobile phone 
business.
Les'll fix it
Buckley made around  7.2million from the sale of his Esat shares when the group was sold to BT in 2000.He 
pumped much of that into Digicel the following year, and ended up with a sizeable minority shareholding.
O'Brien bought out all the minority shareholders in 2007, and Buckley received an estimated  70 million for his 
stake.
He is vice-chairman of Digicel, and remains a shareholder in its two sister companies, which operate mobile phone 
services in Central America and the Pacific region. The Central American operations include Honduras and 
Panama, and have a million subscribers. The Pacific business is in five different markets and has a similar number 
of customers.
The O'Brien/Buckley relationship is unusual. They have been in business together for a very long time, including 
right from the start of several businesses - 98FM, Esat and Digicel. When once asked about their relationship, 
Buckley said:
''My age fits in somewhere between his age and his dad's age. There's a great trust there, and I think that is hugely 
important."
Buckley has been no stranger to publicity and controversy over the years. He was at the centre of a media storm 
while restructuring Irish Steel as its chief executive in the early 1990s. Buckley always knew that the end result 
would be a sale of the state company, and made no bones about telling its staff at the time. This caused some 
ruffled feathers among civil servants who felt he shouldn't be telling staff about it - even if it was true.
In later years, he was a key witness at a CIE cost overrun inquiry. He was called on the basis of his experience as a 
consultant to the state company and his later work for Esat, which had a contract for laying telecommunications 
infrastructure on CIE property. ''Leslie would not have been ruffled by that in any way. He has an ability to deal with 
tense or confrontational situations very well. It's not that he loves a row, he just never shirks from the hard stuff that 
has to happen," said another former business associate.
His tough, cost-driven approach when it came to getting rid of employees earned him something of a reputation as 
a hatchet man in the 1990s - this attribute may now be required again, particularly at Aer Lingus.
Buckley has worked for Aer Lingus before. He was there in the early 1990s, during the Cahill Plan days, when the 
late Bernie Cahill was chairman. ''He is exactly the kind of guy that would make a very strong chairman at Aer 
Lingus, if he was interested at some point. He'd certainly spook the unions," said the former associate.
He is seen as someone who may well become a very influential figure around the board table at INM, when big 
decisions are made in the coming months.
These days, Buckley's working time is spent between the five or so companies where he is a director and his 
Haven house-building project in Haiti. He does not hold an executive position in any company right now, but is vice-
chairman of Digicel, chairman of recruitment specialists Saongroup, and now a director of INM, Aer Lingus and a 
company called Network Recovery.
He believes it is much more enjoyable to be involved in growing a business like Saongroup or Digicel, than 
firefighting as part of corporate restructuring. In a typical month, he is in China, where Saongroup is expanding 
,Haiti, Dublin, and Portugal for some time off. He lives in Dalkey in Co Dublin, and has other houses in west Cork 
and at Quinta do Lago on the Algarve.
His great passion is Haven, a project he founded to build and refurbish homes for some of the poorest families in 
Haiti. This October will see the first wave of 250 Irish people heading to Haiti to finish the construction of 200 
houses and the renovation of another 100.
Buckley and his wife, Carmel, have contributed  1million to the project to get things started. Irish people who want to 
go over for aw eek need to raise  4,000 each. Buckley, who first went to Haiti when Digicel acquired a mobile phone 
business there, is paying all the costs of administration and other work for the first three years.
Les'll fix it
He plans to expand the project, build 1,000 homes and upgrade 2,000 more within the next three years. Haven has 
hired Hugh Brennan, one of the driving forces behind Niall Mellon's South African project, to oversee the 
developments in Haiti.
With an average of six to seven people per family, he wants to change the lives of 20,000 Haitians in three years. 
He would then like to bring the same model to other countries.
Buckley is originally from College Road in Cork. His father ran the family floor covering business, John Buckley & 
Son. He studied science at UCC, which he once said nearly drove him mad. His thesis was on the biosynthesis of 
alkaloids in plants.
He later did a business degree and went to work with Waterford Crystal. He worked his way up to become one of 
five production managers at the company before leaving in 1974.He was brought back to the firm as a consultant in 
the 1990s, and devised a radical cost-cutting plan before moving to Smurfit.
At 64, Buckley is no longer running marathons, but spends much of his leisure time hill-walking or playing golf. He 
was once part of a small group nicknamed the Belfield Bashers, who used to run around UCD's Belfield every 
weekend.
While he has eased up on the running, he still has a bit of 'bashing' left to do - as INM and Aer Lingus may soon 
discover.

Buoyant outlook for airlines

European equity markets gained ground this week - with airlines and automakers grabbing the headlines - though 
progress was fitful.
Indices across the region opened higher on Monday, building on the previous week's gains. But Standard & Poor's 
negative outlook on the UK, along with downbeat comments from the US Federal Reserve, turned markets around 
on Thursday - this in spite of data showing the pace of economic contraction in the eurozone had slowed markedly.
Ascension Day on Thursday meant that many stock markets were closed, including those in Austria, Belgium, 
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Switzerland. Elsewhere, volumes were very low, and continued to be so yesterday.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300, despite falling 2.1 per cent on Thursday and 0.2 per cent on Friday, rose 
1.9 per cent to 856.00 over the five sessions.
France's CAC 40 rose 2.3 per cent to 3,227.97 and Germany's Xetra Dax climbed 3.8 per cent to 3,227.97.
Air France-KLM , Europe's biggest airline by passenger traffic, on Wednesday reported a narrower-thanexpected 
fourth-quarter loss - albeit its first in a decade.
"We are leading the battle and moving more aggressively than Lufthansa and British Airways" in reducing capacity, 
said Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, chief executive. Investors were apparently satisfied, pushing Air France up 11 per 
cent, its sharpest daily rise in 18 months.
However, the French carrier lost 3.2 per cent yesterday after Mr Gourgeon's assertions proved prescient and British 
Airways plunged to a record operating loss, with repercussions throughout the sector. Over the five sessions, Air 
France-KLM rose 11 per cent to EUR10.68.
The wider sector was buoyed by JPMorgan branding European airlines as "particularly attractive", describing them 
as "the crown jewels of industrials".
Buoyant outlook for airlines
Iberia , Spain's national airline, which is set to merge with BA, rose 7 per cent to EUR1.63. Ireland's Ryanair  rose 
1.2 per cent to EUR3.30 and the German  Lufthansa lifted 4.3 per cent to EUR9.60.
Carmakers also had an eventful week. On Monday it was revealed that merger talks between Porsche and 
Volkswagen had collapsed. Yesterday, Porsche said it would take longer than expected for the two to reach an 
agreement. VW rose 0.9 per cent to EUR223.35 in the week. Porsche was up 14.4 per cent to EUR45.18
Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne's plans for a European supergroup were all but scuppered when German 
officials said Canada's Magna International were early favourites to acquire GM's Opel. Fiat fell 0.2 per cent on the 
news, but rose 4.4 per cent to EUR7.80 over the week.
Peugeot subsidiary Faurecia , the car equipment manufacturer, said that its rights issue had been successful. 
Faurecia fell 9.3 per cent to EUR7.05 over the week, while Peugeot rose 17 per cent to EUR19.69.

The Dublin shares market edged up this morning, making modest gains as investors awaited a lead from Wall 
Street's opening this afternoon.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had climbed 27.12 points to 2,741.98.
European shares rose by midday on Friday with gains in banking and mining stocks overshadowing weakness in 
drugmakers and falls in British Airways after the company made a record loss. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was up 0.2 percent at 859.61 points in a choppy session having been up as low as 851.37 
points earlier. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 0.7 percent, Germany's DAX was 1 percent higher and 
France's CAC 40 was up 0.9 percent.
However, all eyes will be on Wall Street after reassuring comments from Moody's eased fears about the credit 
rating outlook for the United States following a downgrade for the UK's outlook yesterday. Shares in AIB rose by 
12c to E1.40, Bank of Ireland gained 4c to E1.49 while Irish Life and Permanent edged up 1c to E3.03. Reports 
today indicate that the six covered banks have until Monday to detail their largest development exposures as these 
are the loans that NAMA will focus on first. The reports also suggests that the legislation to set up the organisation 
will hopefully be published before the Dail's summer break at the end of July and be passed in early September. 
The latest data from the US indicate that the volume and value of highway contracts awarded by US government 
agencies to the end the April remains lower than in the same period last year. The total value of contracts is down 
17pc in the first four months, although the trend has improved significantly with the April figures down 15pc year-on-
year (yoy) compared with -26pc in March. Likewise, the total volume of contracts is 12pc lower yoy but down 8pc in 
April. Shares in CRH, which gets over 50pc of its group earnings from the US, jumped 27c to E18.10. BA's numbers 
at the operating level look in line with its previous guidance of a loss of £150m (before restructuring costs of £75m). 
Operating loss was £220m, including restructuring costs of £78m. Revenue of £8992m, pre-tax profits of £401m

and net income of £358m came in below expectations. On a net basis, consensus and Davy were at -£312m.

The Dublin shares market edged up this morning, making modest gains as investors awaited a lead from Wall 
Street's opening this afternoon.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had climbed 27.12 points to 2,741.98.
European shares rose by midday on Friday with gains in banking and mining stocks overshadowing weakness in 
drugmakers and falls in British Airways after the company made a record loss. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was up 0.2 percent at 859.61 points in a choppy session having been up as low as 851.37 
points earlier. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 0.7 percent, Germany's DAX was 1 percent higher and 
France's CAC 40 was up 0.9 percent.
However, all eyes will be on Wall Street after reassuring comments from Moody's eased fears about the credit 
rating outlook for the United States following a downgrade for the UK's outlook yesterday. Shares in AIB rose by 
12c to E1.40, Bank of Ireland gained 4c to E1.49 while Irish Life and Permanent edged up 1c to E3.03. Reports 
today indicate that the six covered banks have until Monday to detail their largest development exposures as these 
are the loans that NAMA will focus on first. The reports also suggests that the legislation to set up the organisation 
will hopefully be published before the Dail's summer break at the end of July and be passed in early September. 
The latest data from the US indicate that the volume and value of highway contracts awarded by US government 
agencies to the end the April remains lower than in the same period last year. The total value of contracts is down 
17pc in the first four months, although the trend has improved significantly with the April figures down 15pc year-on-
year (yoy) compared with -26pc in March. Likewise, the total volume of contracts is 12pc lower yoy but down 8pc in

Body
The Dublin shares market closed a good week on a low point, making modest losses as investors fretted over the 
perilous state of the US economy.
The ISEQ closed 16.88 points lower at 2,697.98.
U.S. stocks rose on Friday as investors snapped up shares of multinational companies, including McDonald's Corp, 
on hopes that a weaker dollar would underpin profitability. However, the dollar was weakened by fears that the cut 
in fiscal outlook from a global credit ratings agency for the UK during the week could also happen to the US.
A weaker dollar makes some U.S. assets more appealing to some investors, and multinationals benefit when they 
convert overseas earnings into dollars but, analysts say, fears of a downgrade - however remote - will cap any 
gains in equities both in the US and in Europe. Back home, shares in AIB rose by 6c to E1.34, Bank of Ireland 
gained 1c to E1.46 while Irish Life and Permanent edged down 2c to E3.03. Reports today indicate that the six 
covered banks have until Monday to detail their largest development exposures as these are the loans that NAMA

rose by 5c to E0.71 and Ryanair was down 7c to E3.30. The latest Irish retail figures show that the value of 
hardware sales (a proxy for DIY) sales declined by 13pc in March, which represents an improvement on the 16pc 
fall in February and the 22pc decline in January. "In our view this is consistent with recent comments from Grafton 
management that Irish DIY retail sales had held up better than expected in the first quarter with sales down 17pc.

News In Brief
## The government is prepared to divert social welfare funding to pay for a new initiative on job protection and 
creation, Taoiseach Brian Cowen has told union leaders. His willingness is conveyed in a letter responding to a 
proposal from the country's unions for a 1bn euro state investment in jobs. In his letter the Taoiseach said ''we need 
to be imaginative and to break new ground in intervening to sustain jobs'' He added: ''The government intend to 
..apply resources which would otherwise be required for social welfare payments to interventions that are 
worthwhile, targeted and effective." ICT general secretary David Begg said the unions' proposals for a job 
protection initiative ''seems to be finding some resonance on the government side''. However Mr Begg expressed 
concern that the Government appeared to be suggesting that this scheme would be funded by a reallocation of 
existing resources from the social welfare budget. - Irish Times
## Employers who take on jobless workers should get their dole for the next year, Fine Gael candidate George Lee 
proposed last night . He said: "Instead of simply continuing to pay out dole payments, I would like to see a policy 
whereby someone who takes on someone in a new job who has been unemployed for over 12 months will receive 
the dole payments for up to a further 12 months. Our greatest responsibility is to get the country back to work. We 
need new thinking and new ideas." And he added a call for a cut in stamp duty as he outlined his economic strategy 
to an audience in the heart of Dublin South. - Irish Independent
## Building materials giant CRH yesterday borrowed 750m euro from 250 financial institutions and investors 
through a bond sale. The move came just weeks after the Dublin- and London-listed group issued new shares to 
existing stakeholders to raise almost 1.24 bn euro, 500m euro of which will be used to repay existing debts. The 
bonds will be repaid after five years at a rate of 7.375 per cent annually, and were the first euro-denominated bonds 
issued by the company. A spokesman said that the bond sale was routine. - Irish Times ## Ryanair is pledging to

introduce 12 new routes there. Ryanair's director of route development Ken O'Toole said talks have begun with 
Malta's secretary for tourism Mario de Marco, and the airline is hoping the government will agree to an incentive 
plan based on the volume of passengers brought to Malta. - Irish Examiner ## Ireland slipped one place last year in 
a league table of broadband penetration for 30 industrialised nations, according to the latest report from the OECD. 
Ireland ranked 21st at the end of 2008 with 20.57 subscribers per 100 inhabitants. This compared with 17.62 at the 
end of 2007. Denmark had the highest penetration with 37.2 users per 100 inhabitants. In total, Ireland had 896,346 
broadband subscribers, placing the country 27th in the league table. Only the Slovak Republic, Luxembourg and 
Iceland ranked behind us in this table. - Irish Times ## Labour party leader Eamon Gilmore has come under fire 
after apparent gaffe on the banking crisis led to him being accused of showing "shocking ignorance". Mr Gilmore's 
lack of knowledge on the workings of the new state agency to manage the banks debts prompted Transport 
Minister Noel Dempsey to claim yesterday he was damaging the country. The Labour leader seemed to be 
surprised the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) was going to manage good loans, as well as the bad 
debts of banks. "That was quite an astonishing reply. First, we have another shift in what we know. NAMA was 
originally to be set up for distressed loans, but the Taoiseach is now telling the House that it is to include performing 
loans," the Labour leader said on Tuesday. But Mr Dempsey said it was a "simple and straightforward" aspect of 
NAMA's work that it would handle both sets of loans. - Irish Independent ## A trustee of the ESB pension fund, 
which has a 1.9bn euro deficit, has called on the electricity company to suspend paying a dividend to the 
Government until the pension hole is plugged. Joe La Cumbre, a former deputy chairman of the ESB board, said 
the State got 123m euro in dividends last year at a time when the pension was in serious trouble. Another 300m 
euro was pledged to the Energy Regulator to help cut electricity bills. Mr La Cumbre, an executive in the Technical, 
Engineering and Electrical Union (TEEU), claimed it would be questionable from a corporate governance point of 
view to pay a dividend, or any money to the regulator, when the pension had such a large deficit. - Irish

Ryanair kept up the pressure on its arch rival Aer Lingus today with a campaign to extract large pay cuts from its 
chairman and non-executive directors.
Ryanair, Aer Lingus's biggest shareholder with a near 30pc stake, is proposing the former state carrier's chairman 
Colin Barrington receive E35,000 in pay this year compared with the E175,000 he received in 2008.
Ryanair also wants the remuneration of non-executive directors be cut from E45,000 to the 2006 level of E17,500.
"In light of the company's stated need to significantly reduce costs ... the remuneration of the non-executive 
chairman should be reduced," said the Ryanair resolution, detailed in an Aer Lingus statement. Ryanair has twice 
had bids for the group rebuffed, exacerbating an already fractious relationship. Aer Lingus shares were off 1.5pc at 
E0.63 this morning, less than half Ryanair's most recent offer of E1.40 a share. "It's a bit of frustration and also I 
suspect a comment on what O'Leary believes, rightly or wrongly, is an inefficiently run airline," said Stephen

Ryanair kept up the pressure on its arch rival Aer Lingus today with a campaign to extract large pay cuts from its 
chairman and non-executive directors.
Ryanair, Aer Lingus's biggest shareholder with a near 30pc stake, is proposing the former state carrier's chairman 
Colin Barrington receive E35,000 in pay this year compared with the E175,000 he received in 2008.
Ryanair also wants the remuneration of non-executive directors be cut from E45,000 to the 2006 level of E17,500.
"In light of the company's stated need to significantly reduce costs ... the remuneration of the non-executive 
chairman should be reduced," said the Ryanair resolution, detailed in an Aer Lingus statement. Ryanair has twice 
had bids for the group rebuffed, exacerbating an already fractious relationship. Aer Lingus shares were off 1.5pc at 
E0.63 this morning, less than half Ryanair's most recent offer of E1.40 a share. "It's a bit of frustration and also I 
suspect a comment on what O'Leary believes, rightly or wrongly, is an inefficiently run airline," said Stephen 
Furlong, analyst with Davy Stockbrokers. "Clearly they are interested in the fortunes of Aer Lingus, they have and

Ryanair has demanded massive cuts in directors' fees at Aer Lingus.
It has put down motions for the forthcoming Aer Lingus annual shareholders' meeting that would cut ordinary 
directors' fees to 17,500 euro and the fees of a non-executive chairman to 37,500 euro.
The low cost carrier holds a 29pc stake in the formerly state-owned flag carrier.
The motions have been put down for the meeting on June 5. One proposes that the remuneration of non-executive 
directors should be reduced from 45,000 euro to 17,500 euro. Another proposes that the remuneration of the non 
executive chairman should be reduced from 175,000 euro to 35,000 euro. The current Aer Lingus chairman Colm 
Barrington is not a full time employee but is filling in as chief executive following the recent departure of Dermot 
Mannion. The Ryanair motions cite the company's ongoing need to significantly reduce costs, and particularly the 
recent transformational programme which required employees to accept job cuts and pay cuts. The motions also 
provide that any future increases in the remuneration of directors should not exceed the general level of pay 
increase agreed between the company and its employees. Reacting to the motions, Aer Lingus pointed out this 
morning that its board members had already decided in February to reduce their fees voluntarily by 20pc, resulting 
in annual Directors' fees of 36,000 euro and an annual chairman's fee of 140,000 euro for 2009. The airline added: 
"The Aer Lingus board believes that the existing fees are reasonable having regard to the high level of board 
activity and the increase in directors' responsibilities since the IPO. "The Aer Lingus board therefore recommends 
that shareholders vote against the resolutions."

AIRLINES
Aer Lingus has suffered a collapse in passenger numbers and revenue as it searches for a new chief executive, but 
low-cost rival Ryanair continues to grow its traffic. 
Aer Lingus' first-quarter revenues were 16% down on those for the same period in 2008. Total passenger numbers 
fell 6.5% and long-haul traffic suffered an even sharper drop, of 12.5%. Against this backdrop, the airline is to 
"review its long-term requirement for the long-haul capacity on order with Airbus".
The carrier's long-haul fleet comprises four A330-200s and five -300s. It signed a purchase agreement in 2007 for 
12 long-haul Airbus aircraft - six A350-900s and six A330-300s. Deliveries of the A330s have begun, and the A350s 
are due to arrive from 2014.
Aer Lingus forecasts that its loss for the 2009 full year will be "materially below the bottom of the range of current 
market expectations".
When Dermot Mannion stepped down as chief executive in April, chairman Colm Barrington assumed executive 
responsibility. UK recruitment firm The Zygos Partnership has been hired to help find Mannion's successor.
But Barrington stresses that required changes cannot wait for a new chief executive. In response to a decline in 
leisure travel from Ireland to the USA, Aer Lingus is taking "a very critical look" at its US operations, he says. "The 
likelihood is we will not be operating as many routes or frequencies as we currently operate.
"If Aer Lingus is to survive as an independent airline... we have to make the airline efficient in the modern 
marketplace. The extra concern for Aer Lingus is that if it doesn't make itself successful, and therefore retain its 
independence, it will get acquired."
Chop and change INTRODUCTION: Aer Lingus is pondering route and order cancellations as it tries to remain

Aer Lingus has twice staved off hostile takeover bids by Irish budget carrier Ryanair, which holds a near-30% stake 
in it. Ryanair's own passenger numbers rose 12% year-on-year in April, to 5.3 million.

Business aviation comes out fighting
EBAA stresses sector's contribution to European economy and bemoans budget airlines' use of secondary airports
The European Business Aviation Association struck a bullish tone as it raised the curtain on EBACE 2009 by 
emphasising business aviation's contribution to the European economy and airing grievances about budget airlines' 
use of secondary airports.
"A troubling perception of business aviation is taking hold among some policymakers and the media," said EBAA 
president and chief executive Brian Humphries in his opening address. "It's one that views business aviation as 
excessive, a luxury, when in fact it's essential for countless companies the world over, particularly in these tough 
times."
Humphries cited research conducted by consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers, which found that business aviation 
contributed ?19.7 billion ($26.9 billion) in gross value-added to the European economy in 2007. "Our industry has a 
very good story to tell, especially in an economy that places a premium on business competitiveness, job creation 
and innovation," asserted Humphries.
The EBAA sees a threat from airlines such as Ryanair. "Low-cost carriers continue to expand into our secondary 
airports with their unfair but automatic priority over business aviation, however long we've been established at that 
airport," complained Humphries, who also bemoaned "inappropriate blanket security proposals" and the European 
Union's decision to apply the full monitoring, reporting and verification requirements of the emissions trading 
scheme to all operators emitting more than 10,000t of carbon a year.
Eurocontrol director general David McMillan, warned that business aviation is showing "no signs of recovering 
growth" and that the downturn had "knocked three if not four years off traffic growth". According to Eurocontrol 
statistics, business aviation traffic "declined by almost 20%" in the first quarter compared with the same period in 
2008. Total traffic declined 8%.
INTRODUCTION:
Business aviation's return to growth must be facilitated with a "better-performing aviation system", added McMillan. 
Toward this end, the work of the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) taskforce offers "real and specific" 
opportunities, he believes.

Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington has dismissed any chance of the airline going out of business within 18 
months.
Speaking on radio, he said he denied "entirely" an accusation to that effect made by the chief executive of Ryanair 
Michael O'Leary.
He said: "Michael O'Leary speaks a lot of rubbish. Most of Michael O'Leary's rubbish is self-centred and is to make 
some point on his own behalf."
Mr Barrington confirmed, however, that Aer Lingus' operating loss would be bigger this year than it was in 2008. He 
said its passenger traffic was down by 6.5pc in the first quarter of this year, and its yield was down nearly 15pc. 
This, he said, was because the airline was having to discount to keep passenger numbers up. It had already cut 
capacity by 9pc this year, and would be reducing its fleet to match market conditions. He said the airline had 1.2bn 
euro in the bank, which translated into 600m euro net after debts. Mr O'Leary has now hit back, telling the Irish 
Times this morning : "I didn't say they would go bust. I said they could run out of cash, which is something entirely 
different. "He also said Ryanair will lose money this year. No we won't. We've already guided that . "Most of the 
numbers he parrots out are generally wrong." Mr O'Leary told that paper that if the current rate of cash burn 
continued at Aer Lingus, the airline could run out of cash by the end of 2010.

capacity by 9pc this year, and would be reducing its fleet to match market conditions. He said the airline had 1.2bn 
euro in the bank, which translated into 600m euro net after debts. Mr O'Leary has now hit back, telling the Irish 
Times this morning : "I didn't say they would go bust. I said they could run out of cash, which is something entirely 
different. "He also said Ryanair will lose money this year. No we won't. We've already guided that . "Most of the 
numbers he parrots out are generally wrong." Mr O'Leary told that paper that if the current rate of cash burn 
continued at Aer Lingus, the airline could run out of cash by the end of 2010.

Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington has dismissed any chance of the airline going out of business within 18 
months.
Speaking on radio, he said he denied "entirely" an accusation to that effect made by the chief executive of Ryanair 
Michael O'Leary.
He said: "Michael O'Leary speaks a lot of rubbish. Most of Michael O'Leary's rubbish is self-centred and is to make 
some point on his own behalf."
Mr Barrington confirmed, however, that Aer Lingus' operating loss would be bigger this year than it was in 2008. He 
said its passenger traffic was down by 6.5pc in the first quarter of this year, and its yield was down nearly 15pc. 
This, he said, was because the airline was having to discount to keep passenger numbers up. It had already cut

Highlight: Two more carriers to improve websites
Body
British Airways and Air France-KLM made 11th-hour commitments yesterday to ensure their websites for online 
ticket sales did not mislead consumers, senior officials said in Brussels.
Meglena Kuneva, EU consumer commissioner, said the carriers had "expressed their commitment" to join about 50 
other airlines that have agreed to end any misleading advertising or unfair sales practices on their websites.
The commitments came after the Financial Times revealed yesterday that dozens of other airlines had bowed to 
pressure from the European Commission to make booking tickets online cheaper and less confusing.
These practices have been the subject of an 18-month campaign by European consumer authorities. They include 
unclear pricing - so consumers believe that they are buying low-cost flights but only later realise these prices do not 
include taxes and other charges - and optional expenses that are pre-selected, such as buying travel insurance.
Yesterday, Ms Kuneva confirmed that, out of nearly 70 airlines, more than 50 now either had satisfactory websites 
or had agreed to bring these up to scratch. "It is a far cry from the pattern two years ago," she said. "Then, illegal 
practices were widespread. Worse, they seemed almost accepted as normal practice."
But she said there were still about a dozen carriers giving cause for concern, including Emirates, Aeroflot, Air Baltic, 
MyAir, Northwest Airlines (part of Delta Air Lines), Olympic Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, Turkish Airlines and Wind Jet.
The commissioner also stressed Brussels would want to see airlines that had agreed to make changes actually 
comply. But she said: "What we have seen is a tipping point."
An early test could come from Ryanair's decision to start charging a £5/EUR5 fee for online check-in, which will 
become mandatory for all passengers but will not be included in the basic fare.
Air France and British Airways expressed anger at the way the Commission had handled yesterday's ann-
ouncement. BA said: "We have written and spoken to the EU and feel the allegations made against us were not 
correct. We believe our website is fully compliant with EU standards."

Air France-KLM said that they had confirmed their intention "to be in full compliance with all applicable legislation".

Highlight: New findings announced today by the European Commission show that EU airline websites are getting 
much better at complying with consumer protection rules.
Body
New findings announced today by the European Commission show that EU airline websites are getting much better 
at complying with consumer protection rules.
Since September 2007, the Commission has been conducting a wide investigation into airline websites aiming to 
ensure in particular that there is full price transparency, that any conditions attached to an offer are clearly indicated 
and that general contract terms are accessible and fair. In collaboration with 15 EU national authorities and Norway, 
the Commission investigated a total of 137 websites and, as today's report shows, 115 of those have been 
corrected.
The 18-month long investigation was followed in March 2009 by an additional "health check" process against a 
comprehensive 14-points checklist previously agreed with the airlines. This "health check", involving independent 
mystery shopping, focused on the websites of 67 major airlines which serve a total of 339 million passengers. 52 of 
those airlines have either been given a "clean bill of health" and undertaken to maintain the same standards or 
immediately responded to the Commission's consultation with undertakings to remedy outstanding issues; 16 
airlines fell into the first category and 36, amongst them Aer Lingus, Aer Arran and Ryanair, into the second.
EU Consumer Commissioner, Meglena Kuneva said: "This Europe-wide airline investigation is changing the face of 
airline websites across the EU. There is no room for complacency; there is more work to be done. But this first pan-
European enforcement investigation has shown it has real "teeth "and can deliver. The next step is an industry wide 
agreement, and we will continue to monitor developments in the sector closely." Vice President Antonio Tajani, in 
charge of Transport said: "Applying full price transparency is an obligation under the air services regulation. It is a 
duty for airlines to impose high standards across the industry; it is our responsibility to ensure that all players 
respect the same rules. This is of first and foremost importance for the consumer who wants to compare prices 
across airlines and make a real choice."

Budget carriers are now co-operating to end misleading practices, write Nikki Tait  and Jenny Wiggins
Body
Anyone who has bought -airline tickets online knows the problem. An extremely cheap flight is offered, perhaps 
costing as little as a few euros. But when it comes to paying, the price suddenly leaps as a range of unexpected 
items, from booking fees to taxes, is added to the bill right at the end of the transaction.
Worse, the consumer finds that he or she has bought insurance or priority boarding that they did not want simply 
because they failed to spot that options on the website to include extras were "pre-ticked".
This problem, which has bedevilled millions of would-be travellers, has been in the European Commission's sights 
for about 18 months. Back in autumn 2007 it organised a so-called sweep - or survey - by consumer protection 
authorities in 16 member states.
This was the first co-ordinated, pan-EU enforcement action on the consumer front and it revealed hundreds of 
airline and travel websites that were flouting consumer laws. One in every three sites - 137 out of the 388 targeted - 
were misleading or cheating consumers, the sweep revealed.
Since then there has been a steady tussle with carriers to end sharp practices. Two new pieces of legislation, 
including the unfair commercial practices directive, have taken effect, increasing the authorities' leverage to enforce 
change.
Surveys by Which?, the UK consumer group, show that consumers believe putting bags into the hold, airport check-
in desk charges and credit card fees should be included in the advertised price of a flight.
EU legislation on airline ticketing advertising, which came into force in November, was supposed to stop airlines 
omitting taxes and additional charges when marketing flight prices.
But consumer groups say many airlines are not adhering to the rules, with Jet2.com and EasyJet among those that 
automatically charge passengers extra fees to check in bags.
Brussels airline fees crackdown bears fruit
Which? said that Ryanair was the worst offender in terms of additional charges. Ryanair will charge passengers £40 
or EUR40 to issue a boarding card if they arrive at the airport without one from October as it scraps check-in desks.
When a fresh review of the situation was conducted in March this year, and sites were marked against a 14-point 
checklist, Commission officials said that there were still widespread shortcomings. Sixteen airlines met all standards 
and gave a commitment to maintain their web pages at the same level.
They were: Air Malta, Blue!, bmi, bmibaby, Estonian Air, Finnair, Iberia, Malmo Aviation, SAS, Sata Air Acores, Sata 
International, Spanair, TAP, Tarcom, TUIfly and Virgin Atlantic.
It has taken further discussions to pull a much larger group of about 45 airlines into the fold.
Officials will today say they are satisfied that these carriers, too, either have brought their sites up to scratch or are 
prepared to do so.
Included in this group is Ryanair, which claimed to be in compliance several weeks ago, as well as some other well-
known names such as Easyjet, Wizzair and Austrian Airlines.
Ryanair, which has also threatened to charge passengers to use aircraft toilets, said yesterday that it had dropped 
plans to impose a "fat tax" on obese passengers because it could not find a way of collecting one without slowing 
down the turnround of aircraft.
The remaining hard core of about half a dozen airlines either refuse to respond to the authorities or dispute the 
need to change. Officials say that, if no progress can be made, those cases could be subject to domestic 
enforcement proceedings.

Dozens of European airlines, including budget carriers Ryanair, EasyJet and Wizz Air, have caved in to demands 
from Brussels to improve their websites in a move that should make booking tickets online cheaper and less 
confusing.
European Commission officials will announce today that more than 50 airlines have reformed their online booking 
sites, or will do so shortly, after the Commission threatened to "name and shame" them in its first EU-wide 
consumer enforcement action.
The reforms will address concerns about the way some fares were displayed, so that taxes and additional charges 
were only added when a purchase was almost complete rather than at the start of the booking process.
There have also been worries about the use of pre-ticked boxes, which forced consumers to opt out of taking 
insurance, for example, and about the advertising of special offers.
Ryanair said it changed its site at the start of last month, while EasyJet said it would act during the summer. 
Ryanair said it still disagreed with the changes, as some passengers might now fly without insurance by mistake.
There is still a hard core of about half a dozen airlines that either dispute the existence of any problem or have 
refused to reply to Brussels. If no progress is made in these cases, national authorities could be asked to take direct 
enforcement action.
The EU investigation of airlines' ticket selling practices started in September 2007, when an initial study suggested 
that one in three people buying flights online was being misled.
A review in March of practices at nearly 70 airlines found only 16 met appropriate standards.
Meglena Kuneva, EU consumer commissioner, is expected to say today that the EU will continue to monitor 
developments in the sector.

appropriate standards,.
Of those that failed, about 50 - including EasyJet, Wizz Air and Austrian Airlines - have since agreed to deal with 
outstanding issues. Officials say Ryanair claimed to be in full compliance about three weeks ago.
The Commission says that the agreed improvements could benefit more than 300m travellers but there is still work 
to be done to make online ticket sales more transparent.
"The next step is an industry-wide agreement, and we will continue to monitor developments in the sector closely," 
Meglena Kuneva, the EU consumer commissioner, is expected to say this morning.
Officials in Brussels say they were surprised by the level of co-operation they received, after previous attempts to 
force carriers into changing their practices became bogged down in the companies' legal departments. Recently 
officials have put more emphasis on contacting senior management directly, which has proved more successful in 
winning commitments to comply.
The changes follow a review in March of practices at almost 70 carriers.

Leading budget carriers comply
Body
Buying air tickets online should be a less confusing - and, maybe, cheaper - experience after some of Europe's 
leading airlines caved in to a European Commission threat to "name and shame" airlines with misleading ticketing 
websites.
Officials will today reveal that 45 airlines, including Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, have improved their 
websites as a result of the Commission's first pan-European Union consumer enforcement action.
The action focused on websites that withheld information on taxes and additional charges until ticket purchases 
were almost complete, that used pre-ticked boxes for extras, forcing customers to "opt out", and the way some 
airlines advertised special offers.
Anyone purchasing airline tickets online knows the problem. An extremely cheap flight is offered - perhaps costing 
as little as a few euros. But by the time one comes to pay, the price is revealed to be much larger because of items 
added at the end of the transaction - from booking fees to taxes.
Worse, the consumer finds that he or she has needlessly bought insurance or priority boarding simply because 
boxes on the website were "pre-ticked" and the consumer failed to change them.
The Commission will say a small number of companies - including some national carriers - have refused to reform 
their online ticketing practices in line with acceptable standards, while others passed with flying colours.
The Commission says the improvements could benefit more than 300m travellers but there is still work to be done 
to make online ticket sales more transparent. "The next step is an industry-wide agreement, and we will continue to 
monitor developments in the sector closely," Meglena Kuneva, EU consumer commissioner, is expected to say

Today's announcement follows a review of practices against a 14-point checklist at almost 70 carriers. Officials say 
16 airlines met all the -criteria - including -Finnair and Virgin Atlantic.
However, most failed. Of these about 45, including Easyjet, WizzAir and Austrian Airlines, have agreed to deal with 
the outstanding issues. Commission officials say Ryanair had claimed to be in full compliance about three weeks 
ago.
Officials in Brussels say they were surprised by the level of co-operation they received, after previous attempts to 
force carriers into changing their practices had become bogged down in the companies' legal departments. In 
recent weeks officials have put more emphasis on contacting senior management directly - which has proved more 
successful in winning commitments to comply.
However, there are still about half a dozen airlines, including some large carriers, that dispute the existence of any 
issue, or have refused to reply to Brussels. If no progress is made in these cases, national authorities might be 
asked to take direct enforcement action.
The EU enforcement investigation against airlines' ticket-selling practices started in September 2007, when an 
initial "sweep" suggested one in three people buying flights online were being misled. It was the first time member 
state watchdogs had conducted a co-ordinated effort to enforce consumer protection laws.

Body
Ryanair, the European budget airline known for adding an array of extra charges to its typically low base fares, 
announced new fees Wednesday as it abolishes check-in desks in favor of on-line ticketing, an innovation being 
studied by airlines worldwide.
The Dublin-based company said everyone booking a seat on a Ryanair flight from May 20 onward will be required 
to print out their own tickets at a mandatory cost of €10 or 10 British pounds ($13.70 to $15.30) per passenger per 
round-trip journey. Anyone who fails to do this will suffer a €40 or 40-pound ($55 to $61) penalty at the airport.
This fee policy replaces Ryanair's previous practice of offering free on-line ticketing and charging extra for anyone 
who opted for face-to-face check-in. The old policy discriminated against passport-holders from outside the 
European Economic Area, who were barred until recently from checking in via Ryanair's Web site.
Under the new policy, everyone will be treated the same because now nobody can avoid paying to check in. 
Ryanair says the only exceptions will be on tickets offered at fee-included prices of €5 or less.
Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said the airline hoped to shut down all of its traditional check-in desks at 
146 airports by Oct. 1, but quicker if possible.
However, Ryanair will keep staffing desks to collect people's checked-in bags as well as potentially hefty income 
from passengers arriving without their printed-out tickets.
In-built restrictions on Ryanair's on-line ticketing system mean that many customers will be unable to print out their 
tickets at the time of booking, raising the chances for Ryanair to collect penalty charges from customers who think 
they've completed the process.
Ryanair says its computer system won't allow customers booking more than 15 days before their flight, or within 
four hours of one, to check in at that time. So people booking farther in advance common since Ryanair's cheapest 
deals often are offered months ahead and snapped up quickly will have to get in the habit of revisiting the Web site 
again nearer the time of their trip. And last-minute fliers will face an effective €40 surcharge on their fares.
Ryanair unveils new check-in charges, penalties
European Union litigation has forced Ryanair to change the way it lists the costs of its tickets to include taxes and 
some but not all fees up front. Still, advertised "free" tickets can end up costing €20 to €80.
For example, Ryanair adds €10 or more to each round-trip ticket per passenger if it's purchased with normal credit 
or debit cards, making the charge virtually impossible to avoid. Nonetheless, this cost is omitted from the initial 
price. The airline defends this practice because it offers the option of free booking for holders of a restrictive, ill-
marketed Visa Electron card that is not available in major countries.
Ryanair increasingly celebrates its penchant for imposing hard-to-avoid fees.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary in recent months has alternately baffled, inflamed and amused press conferences 
with claims now conceded to be sharp exercises in fanning free publicity that he might introduce charges to use 
aircraft toilets and make Ryanair's fattest passengers pay extra. He also has floated the idea of selling Ryanair toilet 
paper with his own face on each sheet.

From next Wednesday, all Ryanair passengers will need to check-in online and use the 'bag-drop' at airports.
The airline is phasing out the use airport of check-in desks from its 146 airports by 1st October next.
From Wednesday Ryanair will no longer accept bookings for unaccompanied minors (under 16 years old) while all 
new bookings will require passengers (including infants and domestic flight passengers) to hold a valid passport or 
valid national identity card.
The no-frills airline said that it will remove its E10/£10 airport check-in fee and introduce a E5/£5 online check-in fee 
per person, per flight, on new bookings, other than promotional fares, while a E40/£40 'boarding card re-issue fee' 
will be introduced to encourage all passengers to arrive at the airport with their pre-printed web check-in boarding 
card. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Passengers travelling without checked in bags have already embraced 
our online check-in service and the extension of this service to all passengers, including those with hold luggage 
and those travelling with infants will allow all passengers to forever avoid check-in queues. This will also allow 
Ryanair to lower our airport and handling costs and pass these savings to all passengers in the form of even lower 
air fares next winter." "Ryanair's web check-in service allows passenger to check-in from 15 days to 4 hours before, 
and print, or re-print, their boarding card up to 40 minutes prior to their scheduled departure time. Web check-in can 
be accessed via ryanair.com using booking confirmation numbers or flight details".

Ryanair today called for London Stansted to be sold after BAA figures confirmed that passenger traffic at the airport 
fell by 13pc in April.
This was despite Easter falling in April this year and highlighted that traffic has plummeted by 14pc at London 
Stansted in the first four months of 2009.
Ryanair also called for Gordon Brown to follow the lead of the Belgian and Dutch Governments by scrapping his 
£10 tourist tax in response to the 8pc fall in traffic at BAA's UK airports so far this year which has resulted in over 
three million fewer passengers at BAA airports alone in the first four months of 2009.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Today's confirmation that London Stansted traffic has collapsed by 14pc so far 
this year proves that the Competition Commission's recommendation that the airport be sold is the only way to 
protect London tourism and jobs and we call for the fast-tracking of its sale in order to tackle the airport's 
plummeting traffic. The abysmal performance of the BAA airports underlines the urgent need for Government action 
to protect UK tourism and UK jobs. BAA airports have lost over 3 million passengers so far this year and the UK 
Government must follow the lead of the Belgian and Dutch Governments by scrapping its insane £10 tourist tax".

It was a good week for bottom fishers. The Iseq continued its recent bounce last week, closing at 2,676 - 14 per 
cent ahead of the level at which it began the year and4 2 per cent above the low it reached in early March.
Although the index's performance is largely a function of just two stocks - CRH and Ryanair, which between them 
account for half of the total index weighting - recent buyers of Irish bank shares had more to celebrate than 
shareholders of longer standing.
Bank of Ireland extended recent gains to end the week just shy of  1.28, helped along by the return of hedge funds 
into Irish bank stocks. A successful bottom fisher who called the bottom at the right time, when the bank was trading 
at just 12 cent prior to Richie Boucher's appointment as chief executive earlier this year, could have cashed in last 
Friday with a return equal to ten times his or her original investment.
The two other quoted financial stocks, AIB and Irish Life and Permanent (ILP), also continued to rebound despite 
ongoing jitters towards the sector and fears over the nationalisation of certain institutions.
AIB closed last Friday above  1.18 - more than four times the lowest price at which it traded this year. ILP also 
traded at more than four times its lowest price this year.
The bounce in banking stocks was mirrored by an improved performance by construction stocks , which continued 
to undo the damage to their share prices over the past two years.
Building materials group Grafton ended the week at  2.88,more than double its lowest price earlier this year, while 
insulated panel manufacturer Kingspan also traded at double its trough price level at  4.36.
Most of the Iseq's top ten companies have recorded gains so far this year, with CRH and Ryanair ahead by 6 per 
cent and10 per cent respectively. Kerry and Elan, the third and fourth largest members of the Iseq, traded 20 per 
cent ahead last week.
Newer investors reap the rewards while long-timers lose out
Smaller Irish pharmaceutical companies Amarin, Trinity Biotech and AGI Therapeutics stand among the best 
performers on the Dublin market so far this year, with gains of between 70 per cent and100 per cent since January.
For share holders in some other companies, however, this year has continued where 2008 left off, with continued 
share price weakness. Among the Dublin market's worst performers are Aer Lingus (down 58 per cent), 
Independent News and Media (down 26 per cent), housebuilder McInerney (down 30 per cent) and Fyffes property 
spin-off Blackrock International Land( down 28 per cent).

Inmarsat has defied predictions that it would be hard hit by the slowdown in global shipping after revealing 
underlying growth of 7.7 per cent in its key maritime business.
The group provides broadband internet communications for remote areas of the globe, and many observers feared 
that its largest market - providing shipboard satellite phones and internet connections - would be hurt by the 
reduction in global shipping.
But first-quarter results underlined the growing importance of broadband data services on ships, particularly Navy 
vessels, where Inmarsat can provide a connection of nearly 500 kilobytes per second.
Data services rose 3.6 per cent while voice services fell 0.8 per cent. The number of terminals used to access 
commercial services in the maritime sector also rose 11.5 per cent to 162,000.
"With these factors in mind, we remain confident in our revenue growth objectives for the year," said Andrew 
Sukawaty, chief executive. Broadband, which is so used in business and in our personal lives, has been extended 
to these remote environments. We are tapping an underserved market, which is driving growth."
He added: "We can see volumes of data traffic and telephone traffic on a daily basis and we don't have a 
slowdown."
Overall maritime revenues rose just 2.3 per cent as Inmarsat introduced a more even phasing of volume discounts 
across its financial year.
Strongest growth in the quarter came from the aeronautical sector, where revenue rose 32 per cent to $16.8m from 
governmental and corporate jets.
The group hopes to see further growth as commercial passenger airlines such as Emirates and Ryanair begin 
allowing passengers to make mobile calls mid-flight, using Inmarsat's satellites.
Shipping services buoy up Inmarsat results
Revenue for the quarter rose 10.5 per cent to $163.4m (£108.5m) while pre-tax profit rose 23 per cent to $50.3m. 
Free cash flow improved by $50m, swinging from an outflow in the first quarter of last year, reflecting the end of 
capital expenditure in new satellites.
The figures do not include the group's purchase of Stratos Global Corporation, one of its distributors, which was 
completed on April 15. Stratos gives Inmarsat a direct retail arm for the first time, although sales through other 
distributors will still make up the bulk of its business.
Inmarsat's shares rose 38p to close at 581p.

Revenues at the Irish Aviation Authority, which is responsible for managing traffic through Irish air space, rose by 
8.1pc but profits fell sharply in what it called a "difficult year" in 2008.
The commercial semi-State body reported full year 2008 revenues rose to E166.7 million, up from E154.2 million in 
2007.
Profit after tax was recorded at E12.2 million, down from E14.7 million in 2007.
The IAA is responsible for the provision of air traffic control services in Irish-controlled airspace, and the safety 
regulation of the Irish civil aviation industry. The IAA's revenue primarily comes from charging aircraft that use Irish 
airspace. It said that the second half of 2008 was particularly difficult as a number of factors conspired to create 
economic problems for its airline customers. Following on from the high oil prices in the first half of the year, came 
the impact of the credit crunch, meltdown in financial markets and the onset of global economic recession, it said. 
The deterioration in the financial markets also had a severe impact on the Authority's pension scheme and it is 
currently examining ways in which to re-structure its pension fund. Terminal commercial traffic (i.e. commercial 
aircraft landing or departing the three State airports) rose by less than 1pc compared to 2007 figures to 269,684 
movements. En route traffic rose marginally by less than 1pc to 309,181 movements. The majority of these are 
aircraft which over-fly Irish-controlled airspace en route between Europe and North America and do not touch down 
at Irish airports. North Atlantic airspace communications traffic rose by 1.8pc to 422,086 flights. The IAA radio 
station at Ballygirreen, Co. Clare provides the vital radio link between air traffic controllers and pilots on the Eastern 
half of the North Atlantic. The trend in 2009 so far shows a "continuing and significant decrease in traffic levels". 
The first four months, when compared to the same period in 2008 show that Dublin Airport (commercial)

Revenues at the Irish Aviation Authority, which is responsible for managing traffic through Irish air space, rose by 
8.1pc but profits fell sharply in what it called a "difficult year" in 2008.
The commercial semi-State body reported full year 2008 revenues rose to E166.7 million, up from E154.2 million in 
2007.
Profit after tax was recorded at E12.2 million, down from E14.7 million in 2007.
The IAA is responsible for the provision of air traffic control services in Irish-controlled airspace, and the safety 
regulation of the Irish civil aviation industry. The IAA's revenue primarily comes from charging aircraft that use Irish 
airspace. It said that the second half of 2008 was particularly difficult as a number of factors conspired to create 
economic problems for its airline customers. Following on from the high oil prices in the first half of the year, came 
the impact of the credit crunch, meltdown in financial markets and the onset of global economic recession, it said. 
The deterioration in the financial markets also had a severe impact on the Authority's pension scheme and it is 
currently examining ways in which to re-structure its pension fund. Terminal commercial traffic (i.e. commercial 
aircraft landing or departing the three State airports) rose by less than 1pc compared to 2007 figures to 269,684 
movements. En route traffic rose marginally by less than 1pc to 309,181 movements. The majority of these are 
aircraft which over-fly Irish-controlled airspace en route between Europe and North America and do not touch down 
at Irish airports. North Atlantic airspace communications traffic rose by 1.8pc to 422,086 flights. The IAA radio 
station at Ballygirreen, Co. Clare provides the vital radio link between air traffic controllers and pilots on the Eastern 
half of the North Atlantic. The trend in 2009 so far shows a "continuing and significant decrease in traffic levels". 
The first four months, when compared to the same period in 2008 show that Dublin Airport (commercial) 
movements are down 12pc, en route (overflights) traffic is down 7pc and North Atlantic Communications traffic is 
down 7pc. Notwithstanding the difficult economic environment, the Irish aircraft register continued to grow with a

total of 1,179 aircraft on the Irish register at 5 May 2009, up from 1,168 in December 2008. Heavy commercial 
aircraft currently stand at 470 while the number of Irish aircraft on overseas 'dry leases' or in storage is 219, up nine 
on the previous year. Helicopter numbers have shown a decrease in recent years with 144 registered at the end of 
April 2009 compared with 162 in early 2008. Currently, the main carriers are Ryanair (187 aircraft), Aer Lingus (47 
aircraft), CityJet (27 aircraft), Aer Arann (10 aircraft) and Air Contractors (16 aircraft). The IAA provides safety 
standards surveillance on all Irish air carriers, personnel, maintenance organisations and aircraft. Speaking at its 
Annual General Meeting today, IAA chairman Mr. Jerry Liston expressed his satisfaction by saying; "I am very 
pleased to report that while 2008 was a very difficult year for the aviation industry, the IAA maintained a satisfactory 
performance, both as a safety regulator and as a provider of air navigation services."

Highlight: The Dublin shares market lurched in and out of the red before closing sharply lower in the afternoon 
ahead of details of stress-tests on US banks and as CRH slumped again.
Body
A roller coaster day in Dublin saw the stock market here lurch in and out of the red.
It ended its day with a dive, led by a new slump in the shares of building materials giant CRH.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 91.74 points lower at 2,590.26. The late drop in the market came after the 
European Central Bank cut its key eurozone interest rate by 0.25pc to 1pc. Analysts in Dublin said the cut should 
have encouraged investors, but in practice it was more or a reminder that that even this cut was not enough for the 
Irish economy. Davy Research said that nominal interest rates would be too high for us even at 0pc - a full point 
lower than the new ECB rate. "That is because Ireland is experiencing deflation for the first time in almost 50 years, 
the firm said. "Real interest rates here are closer to 3pc compared with the negative rates seen for much of the past 
decade." It was a second day of big falls for CRH, after a profit warning that it issued earlier this week. Today's 
133c drop in the price of its shares (7pc) left them at just 1707 by the close. Other shares fared better. Cider maker 
C and C edged 2c higher to 186 on hopes that this year's summer will be kinder to sales than the atrocious weather 
of last year. Distribution group DCC gained 9c to 1414, with insurer FBD up 10c to 610 and prepared foods group 
Greencore adding 4c to 111. Food group Kerry was up by 35 to 1585 and recruiter CPL added 4c to 117. Things 
were not so good with the airlines. Shares in Ryanair fell by 31c to 329 and Aer Lingus was down 1c to 64 as oil 
prices headed sharply higher. The Dublin market closed before the much anticipated release in the US of stress 
tests by the government on major banks, to determine if they need more government money. The tests are to set 
"capital buffers for each of the US' 19 largest banks and lay out bank plans to boost capital if necessary. "(This) is 
not a solvency test," Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said ahead of the release. "All the banks, inclusive of the capital 
they received from the government, are solvent." Bernanke said publication of test results "will allow, I hope, 
markets to have greater confidence that they know the condition of the banks and can be reassured that banks will 
be strong and be able to lend even if the economy is worse than currently expected". Uncertainty about what the 
test results would mean for the global financial sector, Irish banks were mixed at the close. Shares in AIB had

Highlight: The European Commission has been criticised for Ryanair takeover leaks
Body
The European Commission has been criticised by its own ombudsman after 'highly sensitive' information furnished 
by Ryanair during its 2006 Aer Lingus takeover attempt made its way into the public domain.
Ryanair complained to the European Ombudsman in May 2007 after information it provided to the EC to assist its 
investigation of the failed 2006 takeover bid for Aer Lingus was made public through what Ryanair described as 
'numerous and serious breaches of confidentiality'.
Ryanair claimed the commission gave information to the media regarding a meeting between it and the airline's 
representatives.
It also claimed the commission had given Ryanair's so-called remedies response to the commission's statement of 
objections to the takeover to both Aer Lingus and the Department of Transport. Ryanair, which now owns almost 
30pc of the flag carrier, had told the commission it would surrender some landing slots owned by Aer Lingus at 
Heathrow, and slots elsewhere belonging to Ryanair. The budget carrier maintained that the document should only 
have been sent to other airlines that might wish to take up the landing slots. The commission denied it was the 
source of leaks to media outlets of information received from Ryanair. It also said it had conducted an internal 
review to determine how information it held found its way to the media. The ombudsman there was no specific 
evidence to suggest the commission had been the source of leaks to the press. Aer Lingus also denied leaking 
Ryanair's remedies document to the media.

A bout of profit taking brought the ISEQ's five day winning streak to an end with the index also weighed down by 
CRH's profit warning.
The ISEQ closed 21.26 points lower at 2,682.00.
Shares in CRH - the Dublin market's biggest listing by market cap - slumped by E1.17 each to E18.67.
Shares in United Drug fell by 13c to E2.07 after it reported a 10pc fall in pre-tax profits to E30m for the six months 
to the end of March. The company said the fall in sterling's value knocked E3m off profits, while turnover was flat at 
E850.9m. Operating profits were down 4pc to E35m, though United says there was a 5pc rise when currency 
effects were excluded. United said the difficult economic conditions resulted in reduced consumer spending on 
over-the-counter medicines and cosmetics and lower hospital spending on equipment. Delays in spending by US 
drug companies also led to a 'below target' performance in its packaging business. The government has appointed

Ryanair Holdings April traffic, load factor up - Update
Ryanair Holdings April traffic, load factor up - Update

Body
(RTTNews) - Wednesday, low-cost airline operator Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported a 12% increase 
in traffic and 3 percentage points rise in load factor for the month of April, partially helped by Easter falling later this 
year in the month of April.
Dublin, Ireland-based Ryanair's load factor for April rose 3 percentage points to 82% from 79% in the year-ago 
period. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, or RPMs, increased 12% to 5.3 million from 4.7 million in the 
same month last year.
The company noted that passengers opted for its low fares over the high fares and fuel surcharges charged by flag 
carriers such as the likes of Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa.
For the recently concluded third quarter, Ryanair had reported a rise in traffic of 13% to 14 million RPMs, as more 
consumers switched to low fares from high fare competitors. The company, however, posted a loss for the third 
quarter, hurt by higher fuel costs.
While updating its guidance on February 2, the company said that it expects fourth-quarter loss to be narrower than 
previously expected, helped by lower oil costs and continuing reductions in non oil operating costs. The company 
also expects fourth-quarter average fares to fall by 20% at the upper end of its previously guided range.
For fiscal 2009, the company currently anticipates an after-tax net profit in the range of 50 million euros - 80 million 
euros before exceptional items compared with its prior forecast of breakeven.
RYAAY is currently trading at $29.24, up $0.41 or 1.42%, on a volume of 0.25 million shares on the Nasdaq. RYA.L 
is trading at 3.52 pence on the LSE, up 0.15 pence or 4.53% on the LSE.

Passenger numbers at Ryanair rose by 12pc in April compared to the same month last year, it said today.
The no-frills Irish airline carried 5.3 million passengers last month compared to 4.7 million in the same month in 
2008.
It has carried 59.1 million passengers in the 12 months to the end of April, it said today.
Ryanair's load factor - a measure of how efficiently it fills its aircraft - rose by 3pc last month to 82pc compared to 
the 79pc recorded in April 2008. Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said: "We continue to grow our 
monthly traffic as passengers switch to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharge from BA's high 
fares, unfair fuel surcharges and flight delays. Ryanair carried 5.3 million passengers in April, an increase of 12pc, 
and while some growth can be attributed to Easter falling later this year April was another strong month of growth at 
the expense of high cost airlines who see passengers continue to switch to Ryanair. Ryanair now carries more than 
double the monthly traffic of BA proving, yet again, that the self titled "World's favourite airline" isn't even Britain's 
favourite anymore'.

Passenger numbers at Ryanair rose by 12pc in April compared to the same month last year, it said today.
The no-frills Irish airline carried 5.3 million passengers last month compared to 4.7 million in the same month in 
2008.
It has carried 59.1 million passengers in the 12 months to the end of April, it said today.
Ryanair's load factor - a measure of how efficiently it fills its aircraft - rose by 3pc last month to 82pc compared to 
the 79pc recorded in April 2008. Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said: "We continue to grow our 
monthly traffic as passengers switch to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharge from BA's high

Something fishy in the offing
Jason Whooley of BIM(26/04/09) claims there are many reasons to be upbeat about the state of Irish fishing. 
However, his optimism is neither realistic nor fair.
Fishing in Ireland is a scandalously money losing industry. The Common Fisheries Policy has enabled the 
handicapping of fishermen, and the loss of billions of euro worth of fish from Irish waters.
Whooley's analysis smacks of an official who is not in touch with the fisherman in his boat - the fisherman who 
wonders how much fish he will have to dump because it's in excess of a quota, and who fears the grimace of a 
judge and the fines if he catches more fish than he is allowed to. Most fishermen have to watch the weight of their 
cargo more closely than passengers boarding a Ryanair flight.
Why is it that Spanish trawlers that take three days to get to Ireland have a far higher quota than native Irish 
fishermen who are three hours from the fish source?
And, because Irish supermarkets are flooded with foreign imports, Irish fishermen get very poor prices for their fish. 
Never does Whooley recommend people to buy Irish fish. This should be of epic economic and environmental 
concern. Money and carbon miles are being spent exporting fish, while money is also being spent to import fish.
According to the IFO, if everyone were to fish in their own waters, there wouldn't be the serious issue of Spanish 
and French trawlers' over access to Irish waters.

Rueing our one-party state
Letters to the Editor
Backroom's Machiavellian advice to the Taoiseach (19/4/09)is to ''manufacture a general election in the autumn''. 
According to Backroom, this would ''let Fianna Fáil see out the recession from the comfort of opposition, and allow it 
to refresh itself for government when the good times return''.
In other words, when the recession is over, it's back to the old one party state. Then, presumably, Backroom and 
his fellow media cheerleaders can get back to another quarter of a century of being inside the tent.

Solution to the banking crisis?
Much has been written recently about 'zombie banks' and the impact on our economy. The zombie banks threat 
helped to drive through the massive state bailout, the argument being that the state couldn't allow our banks to 
remain in a zombie state indefinitely.
But who really cares if AIB and Bank of Ireland are zombie banks for years to come? The fact is that the economy 
needs short and long term lending facilities, to enable goods and services to be bought and sold on credit, and the 
property markets to stabilise. We need security so that Ireland has a stable financial system, and so that savings 
(including corporate savings) remain in Ireland.
Instead of merely pumping money into the 'old ways of doing business' (such as AIB, Bank of Ireland), the state 
should look at the tools at its disposal.
An Post's Postbank already has many elements of a bank, through its joint venture with Fortis Bank. Postbank 
claims to have the largest retail banking presence in Ireland. It offers savings and investments and, more 
importantly, overdrafts and credit cards. Why not extend its services to residential mortgages? It is unlikely to do as 
bad a job as the banks.
The mortgage administration could be centrally managed, to ensure a prudent approach. Perhaps the state's own 
'bad bank', the former Anglo Irish Bank, could be used to provide some expertise - don't throw the baby out with 
Sean FitzPatrick's bathwater.
As recently as last November, ESB International outlined plans to expand further into Britain, having previously 
identified  4 billion to fund expansion overseas. Surely these plans should be canned for now, and that money used 
elsewhere?
It wasn't too long ago that ESB offered credit for people to buy white goods (such as washing machines and 
computers).This expertise could be reawakened to help consumers to purchase an even broader range of goods on 
credit.
A different type of solution could be offered to the commercial banking sector. ICC and ACC banks, as apparatuses 
of the state, successfully offered credit facilities to the commercial sector. These could be bought back from their 
current owners very cheaply, or new equivalents created - the Phoenix Bank from the ashes of Anglo Irish, perhaps 
The state has offered commercial banking before. Why not again?

Defending the Church
Garvan Grant's 'Letter to a pope' (12/4/09)w as a perfect example of the kind of puerile, liberal/feminist dogma 
which represents 'modern liberal' Ireland. If one wanted to epitomise the kind of brain-dead acceptance of hand-me-
down discredited ideologies (which those of us who think for ourselves rejected at about seven years of 
age),Grant's 'letter' does it to perfection.
Letters to the Editor
While one can laugh off the immaturity and irrationality of Grant's worldview, there is a more serious question about 
how a sentient human being could pass through the education system and retain such uncritical views. Are 
students no longer encouraged to think for themselves?
Eric Conway Navan, Co Meath
* Rosaria Macari laments the fact that her friends aged under 30 are willing to defend the Catholic Church, but 
perhaps it is because they have actually studied the teaching of the Church. Often it appears that its critics base 
their arguments on how the media interprets that teaching, as happened in the case of the criticism of Pope 
Benedict for comments on homosexuality which, in fact, he did not make.
It is sad that so many people are willing to accept as gospel what appears in the media, but not so willing to 
examine and research the actual Gospels on which the Church bases her teaching.
I do not know what ''backdated views'' of the 1930sMacari is referring to, but it is no harm to point out that some 
things remain right or wrong, no matter what the era.
Mary Stewart Donegal town
* I was dismayed at your publication of an offensive little piece entitled 'Letter to a pope'. I did not think that an 
article of this calibre would ever defile the pages of The Sunday Business Post, which I regarded as the last Sunday 
newspaper of quality in Ireland. Alas, now there is none, as the race to the bottom speeds up.

The trouble with Michael O'Leary
The trouble with Michael O'Leary

Length: 1017 words
Body
The thing about Michael O'Leary is that you'd like to like him. But he just makes it too difficult.
This is the man who revolutionised air travel for a population stranded on the periphery of Europe. We used to be 
forced to pay ridiculous sums of money to get off the island. Michael O'Leary changed that, not just for us, but also 
for our fellow European citizens.
He clearly has a fantastic business mind, works incredibly hard, has a good (if somewhat twisted) sense of humour, 
and has built up an impressive company.
If only he could resist cheap publicity. For those of you who may have experienced a news blackout last week, the 
Ryanair boss gave his thoughts on swine flu and said it was all a load of ''bloody nonsense''. He said a couple being 
treated in Scotland for the virus after a honeymoon in Mexico were in no danger of dying.
Only people living in slums in Asia or Mexico were at risk, he said, while ''a few Strepsils' 'would do the honeymoon 
couple.
It's easy to dismiss this as typical O'Leary bombast. He is a one-man global publicity machine and, of course, paper 
doesn't refuse ink and all that.
But my, what high stakes he is playing for this time. How could he have any idea about that couple's state of 
health? For many already, this is a life or death situation, and we've no idea how it's going to end.
Usually O'Leary reserves his insensitivities for non-life threatening situations, and displays particular delight in being 
outrageously sexist.
He strikes me as one of those males whose mental development in this area arrested in sports locker-room chat 
when he was about 16.
The trouble with Michael O'Leary
He has been known to use words such as ''rape'' when describing aggressive corporate manoeuvres. He clearly set 
out to shock what he believed to be a prudish German population when he spoke there about how ''blowjobs' would 
be free for business-class passengers on proposed new transatlantic Ryanair flights. And, of course, he does it all 
in such a blokey way that anyone who might object is at risk of seeming like an awful prude.
Looking back over his press clippings (of which there is a multitude),O'Leary and his company have, in the past, in 
different ways, targeted the blind, the elderly, disabled people and females.
More recently, he unveiled suggestions to charge overweight passengers extra, not to mention those with weak 
bladders who he said might soon be charged to use the onboard toilet facilities.
The thing about swine flu is that even the experts are not sure what is going to happen, let alone O'Leary. I'd 
imagine that what the man knows about flu pandemics could fit on the top of a pin. But what he does know about is 
protecting his business. This flu scare is not good for the airline business, no matter how you look at it. As well as 
his honeymoon remarks the other day, O'Leary also said the flu was being used as an opportunity to distract people 
from the day-today news on the economy.
The words 'pot', 'kettle' and 'black' come to mind here. I can think of nowhere I would less like to be at the moment 
than on a flight with someone who is infected with swine flu, and that's exactly what he is trying to distract from. As 
a cost-saving measure, airlines re-circulate the existing air in the cabin which means it's a perfect way to catch 
something off your neighbour. Just ask US vice-president Joe Biden, who got into trouble for saying on NBC last 
week: ''If you're in a confined aircraft and one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft."
O'Leary has also kicked up a ruckus recently about the government's new  10 travel tax. It's clearly another 
distraction - this time from Ryanair's performance in the recession. You have to hand it to the Mullingar man: he 
certainly knows how to use the media to his advantage, and the media fall for it every time.
Back to my recent flight on his airline. It was a reasonably priced, but not cheap, flight. We had paid online for three 
bags, but managed to get everything packed into two. Back at home, I argued they would allow us to distribute the 
weight between the two.
Not so, said my ever-suspicious fellow passenger, who insisted on packing a foldable nylon hold all into one of the 
bags. He was so right. It was with great pleasure that he was able to produce the third bag and re-distribute the 
weight when extra money was demanded at the check-in desk.
Later, we sat and watched, along with all the other passengers, for when the gate would open, immediately 
springing up when we saw the sign. There was a rush for the priority and non-priority queues, and people almost, 
but not quite, descended to pushing each other out of the way. I laughed when I saw that the priority queue (which 
we had paid extra for because of travelling with a small child) was twice the length of the non-priority one.
Everyone subsequently barrelled across the tarmac to get to the aircraft steps, and into the plane to ''bags'' their 
seats. There's no great sense of relief when you do so, just a slight feeling of embarrassment at how caught up you 
got in the rush.
Ryanair cabin staff get a bad press, but I have to say that, on the handful of occasions I have flown with the airline, 
they have been pleasant. The onboard prices, as we know, are steep. But having seen a sandwich for sale in the 
airport restaurant for nearly  9,Ryanair prices looked almost reasonable.
We arrived at our destination slightly earlier than advertised, as we did on the trip home. My only onboard complaint 
would be that, while you could hear the many commercial announcements - scratch cards, perfume etc - with 
absolute clarity, once you were in the air, it was virtually impossible to hear what the pilot was telling you when he 
came on from the flight deck.
The trouble with Michael O'Leary
The experience, in its entirety, wasn't too bad at all, apart from we passengers giving in to our baser instincts in the 
queues, and the company-backed money-grabbing antics at the check-in desk. We flew into a typical Ryanair 
airport, small and easy to get out of and, crucially, just minutes away from where we were staying.
As I said, you'd like to like O'Leary, but he just makes it too hard.

Leo Donovan is chief executive of WEEE Ireland, a not-for-profit organisation set up by producers of electrical and 
electronic appliances to comply with EU legislation on recycling. A compliance scheme targeting householders, 
WEEE Ireland coordinates recycling activities on behalf of its members through authorised collection points. It 
employs eight staff in Dublin and receives  10 million in funding annually.
What are the main responsibilities of your job?
As chief executive, my main responsibility is to maximise the collection of household waste electrical equipment and 
batteries on behalf of over 600 electrical and battery producers around Ireland. It is also my responsibility to make 
consumers aware that they can return electrical and battery waste free of charge.
What are your main motivators?
I want to provide the most cost-effective solution for members and consumers. Last year, over 30,000 tonnes of 
household Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) was collected in Ireland.
This figure translates to over 9kg per person - more than double the EU target - but I would still like to see some 
improvement. I want to cement our leading position in Europe and meet our target of collecting 25 per cent of 
batteries placed on the Irish market.
How would you describe your work style?
WEEE Ireland is run as an autonomous operation. Each individual has their own level of responsibility, which allows 
them to develop their skills and initiative.
What would you rate as the best decision you ever made in business?
Working Week
WEEE Ireland decided that a visible fee would work best for electronic recycling in Ireland. This gives transparency 
to the customer, as it highlights their entitlement to the free take-back of electronic waste.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learned?
Believe in our own vision. We kept pushing for visible fees, even though the measure was not supported by 
everyone. The resulting system is one of the best in Europe. It is important to have a strong working relationship 
with all of our stakeholders.
Who do you most admire in Irish business?
I admire Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. We come from similar financial backgrounds. Initially he was media-shy, but he 
turned that weakness into a strength. His most admirable quality is his commonsense approach to business and 
life. This was clear in his argument as to why Ryanair should invest in Aer Lingus.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
Even after the budget changes kick in this month, we will still have good spending power. Any good business, 
offering a strong product or service, will trade well. Our cost base must come down, especially our rent. We need to 
support Irish businesses in this area. In the electronics sector, we need to bear in mind the lower Vat rate in 
Northern Ireland.
What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?
I want to achieve the highest recycling rates in Europe in an environmental and cost effective way.

Aer Lingus launches third bid for shareholder backing

Aer Lingus is to make a third attempt at winning shareholder backing for a move that has previously been vetoed by 
Ryanair, its biggest single shareholder.
The former state-owned airline, in which Ryanair has a 29 per cent stake, will ask shareholders at next month's 
agm to approve a motion that will allow the company to bypass existing shareholders if it seeks to issue fresh 
shares.
Aer Lingus management failed in its attempt to approve the initiative at the 2007 shareholder meeting, when 
Ryanair voted against the motion.
Although 68 per cent of voting shareholders voted in favour, the motion failed as it was classed as a special 
resolution and required the support of 75 per cent of shareholders. A similar motion proposed for last year's AGM 
was withdrawn without being put to a vote.
Aer Lingus has described the resolution as technical in nature and insisted the failure to win shareholder backing 
would not affect the airline's day-to-day operations.
A Ryanair spokeswoman said the company had yet to receive formal notification of the motions being put before 
this year's agm. Ryanair would study these motions ''in due course'', she said.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has selectively used the airline's stake in Aer Lingus to oppose motions 
recommended by its board.
A number of motions, which required simple majorities rather than 75 per cent backing, have been carried despite 
Ryanair's opposition.

* British insurer Aviva has reported an increase in its capital cushion and said its first-quarter sales rose by a better 
than expected 11 per cent. Aviva, which last month suffered sharp share price falls due to concerns about its capital 
strength, said its solvency surplus had risen to stg£2.5 billion by the end of March from £2 billion three months 
earlier.
* Aer Lingus has said its revenue fell by 16 per cent in the first quarter of 2009, compared with a year earlier.
The shares ended down 19 per cent, at 56 cent. Aer Lingus said it was facing an exceptionally tough trading 
environment.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary described the Aer Lingus figures as ''appalling'', but ruled out another 
Ryanair bid for the airline.
* British oil giant BP has reported a 62 per cent fall in first-quarter net profit due to a collapse in oil and gas prices, 
but heavy cost-cutting helped it beat all analysts' forecasts. Europe's second-largest oil company by market value 
said its replacement cost (RC) net profit fell to $2.39 billion, from $6.59 billion last year.
* Building materials group Grafton has said it faced the most challenging trading conditions in decades in the first 
four months of 2009. In a trading statement ahead of its AGM, Grafton said the reduced availability of credit had led 
to ''significantly'' lower investment and spending on housing and residential repair, maintenance and improvement.
* Insurance group FBD has said prices of insurance premiums have been rising in the first three months of this 
year.
Chairman Michael Berkery told shareholders, however, that premiums needed to rise to compensate the industry 
for rising claims costs and lower returns from its investments.

From Mr P. Dent.
Sir, Does Michael O'Leary imagine he will boost Ryanair sales by using his famous sense of humour and saying 
that swine flu will only affect slum-dwellers in Mexico and Asia ? Would he invest his hard-earned cash in a 
company that made witticisms about the horrors caused by the famine in Ireland in the 1840s?
Not only is he wrong but he is also harming a close historic relationship between Ireland and Mexico dating back to 
that country's war of independence.

From Ms Ann Wadman.
Sir, As new cases of swine flu emerge daily around the globe, and as the World Health Organisation raises the alert 
level to five - one level short of a full-blown pandemic - we are greatly obliged to Michael O'Leary, chief executive of 
Ryanair, for putting our minds at rest. His reassurance that "unless we live in an Asian or Mexican slum, we are not 
at risk" (report, April 29) is comforting indeed.
I do not live in an Asian or Mexican slum. I live in an up-market leafy suburb of New York City. If Mr O'Leary is to be 
believed, I have nothing to fear. Yet not five miles from here, a private high school has been closed owing to an 
outbreak of swine flu. I would therefore respectfully suggest that Mr O'Leary refrain from sweeping and 
unsubstantiated statements, which are both irresponsible and dangerous, on a subject about which he is not 
qualified to comment.
Clearly, Mr O'Leary, is more concerned with his bottom line than he is with public health.

Some reassurance has been offered by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who has touchingly said swine flu will kill

Body
Aer Lingus' arch rival and major shareholder, Ryanair, has ruled out a third bid for the former state carrier but says 
it will hold onto its near 30 percent stake unless it receives a significant offer.
"I think Aer Lingus is worthless. If the accountancy rules allowed us we would write down our stake to zero," chief 
executive Michael O'Leary told a news conference.
"I am fairly certain we won't make a third bid."
O'Leary was speaking after Aer Lingus admitted yesterday that its 2009 losses will be "materially" more than the 
market has been expecting. It also said it had a net cash position of 594 million euros as of March 31, down 9 
percent from the end of the year. But Ryanair's O'Leary said the balance sheet was not as strong as the airline 
maintained. "They're running out of cash rapidly. They clearly have a huge pension deficit which again they denied 
in December and there's going to have to be another restructuring," he said. "I think Aer Lingus is going to run out 
of cash." Aer Lingus shares closed 19pc lower last night at 56. Aviation analyst Joe Gill of Bloxham Stockbrokers 
haas urged Aer Lingus to consider a merger in order to avoid becoming another Waterford Wedgwood. He said the 
airline must urgently address its cost base if the value of its equity is to be protected from liquidation. "Doing nothing 
is an insult to the brand's legacy and a dereliction of responsibility by those in political, employee and board circles 
that have material influence on the company. "Without firm leadership, Aer Lingus could become another Waterford 
Wedgwood that drifts on a wave of nostalgia into oblivion," he said. Mr Gill expects its cash pile to shrink to 336m 
euro by the end of this year, and to fall by more than another 100m euro plus in 2010. He expects its operating 
losses to top 120m euro this year and again in 2010. Gill says Aer Lingus needs a large, well-financed, merger 
partner to facilitate change towards an operating platform that can survive very tough markets. Partners could 
include Air France, Ryanair or British Airways, he says.

Aer Lingus' arch rival and major shareholder, Ryanair, has ruled out a third bid for the former state carrier but says 
it will hold onto its near 30 percent stake unless it receives a significant offer.
"I think Aer Lingus is worthless. If the accountancy rules allowed us we would write down our stake to zero," chief 
executive Michael O'Leary told a news conference.
"I am fairly certain we won't make a third bid."
O'Leary was speaking after Aer Lingus admitted yesterday that its 2009 losses will be "materially" more than the 
market has been expecting. It also said it had a net cash position of 594 million euros as of March 31, down 9 
percent from the end of the year. But Ryanair's O'Leary said the balance sheet was not as strong as the airline 
maintained. "They're running out of cash rapidly. They clearly have a huge pension deficit which again they denied 
in December and there's going to have to be another restructuring," he said. "I think Aer Lingus is going to run out 
of cash." Aer Lingus shares closed 19pc lower last night at 56. Aviation analyst Joe Gill of Bloxham Stockbrokers 
haas urged Aer Lingus to consider a merger in order to avoid becoming another Waterford Wedgwood. He said the 
airline must urgently address its cost base if the value of its equity is to be protected from liquidation. "Doing nothing 
is an insult to the brand's legacy and a dereliction of responsibility by those in political, employee and board circles 
that have material influence on the company. "Without firm leadership, Aer Lingus could become another Waterford 
Wedgwood that drifts on a wave of nostalgia into oblivion," he said. Mr Gill expects its cash pile to shrink to 336m 
euro by the end of this year, and to fall by more than another 100m euro plus in 2010. He expects its operating 
losses to top 120m euro this year and again in 2010. Gill says Aer Lingus needs a large, well-financed, merger 
partner to facilitate change towards an operating platform that can survive very tough markets. Partners could 
include Air France, Ryanair or British Airways, he says.

Body
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the budget airline Ryanair, said the swine flu outbreak was a risk only to Asians 
and Mexicans "living in slums". He told a press conference that travellers had little to fear from the deadly virus.
His comments came as companies across the world scrambled to respond yesterday to the spread of the virus. 
Tour and airline companies with activities directly in Mexico meanwhile held crisis meetings, taking quick action to 
cancel trips and offer tourists alternative destinations.
"It is a tragedy only for people living . . . in slums in Asia or Mexico," said Mr O'Leary, according to a report by the 
AFP news agencies . "But will the honeymoon couple from Edinburgh die? No. A couple of Strepsils [a brand of 
throat lozenges] will do the job."
In comments to the Financial Times later Ryanair's chief said news coverage of the virus scare had been "totally 
overdone".
Executives at Carnival, the Miami-based cruise operator, which on Monday had said there was no reason to adjust 
itineraries, were locked in meetings yesterday to examine whether to reroute vessels to avoid the main Mexican 
resorts. It said it would be issuing a statement by 5pm Florida time.
UK tour operators led their other European companies in closing operations to Mexico, with the resort of Cancún 
their main focus of attention. Thomas Cook and Tui Travel, which provide Mexico with most of their European 
customers, both announced they were cancelling flights immediately in light of UK government advice to avoid all 
nonessential trips to the country.
Mexico makes up 2 per cent of each company's business. Thomas Cook cancelled its four weekly flights. From the 
middle of May it would have expected to fly seven times a week to Mexico, taking 2,000 passengers in high season.
Tour operators in Germany, France, Canada and the Netherlands - other big markets for the Mexican tourist 
industry - were expected to follow suit.
Ryanair chief says virus fears should not cancel flights
Both Thomas Cook and Tui will continue to fly empty aircraft to Mexico to bring back passengers on their scheduled 
return flights. Although they are offering to help out tourists in Mexico who want to curtail their holidays, neither 
reported receiving such requests as yet.
Tui, whose brands include First Choice and Thomson, said customers due to fly to Cancún in the next 10 days 
would be offered the choice of amending their destinations free of charge or getting a full refund for the holiday.
As news spread of the impact of reduced travel, there were also concerns that the luxury goods industry could be 
affected, with much of its sales generated by tourist purchases.
Meanwhile, prices for hogs and pork bellies plunged further yesterday as traders anticipated lower demand for pork 
after the outbreak of swine flu. In two days, both commodities have lost more than 7 per cent.
In spite of its name, swine flu is not transmitted by eating pork meat but several countries, including China, have 
already imposed imports bans on hogs from the US and Mexico. Russia, a large buyer of US pork, has also 
imposed an import ban.

Falls for banks and carmakers weighed on Europe's bourses yesterday as fears over swine flu gave way to anxiety 
over US banks failing stress tests.
Deutsche Bank , in spite of reporting better-than-expected first-quarter profit, lost 6.9 per cent to EUR40.26.
Analysts put this down to profit-taking and the bank posting EUR1bn in writedowns for the first three months of the 
year, as well as to the sector's woes.
Josef Ackermann, chief executive, said there were still "challenges, but also opportunities, in our business 
environment".
France's BNP Paribas fell 3.8 per cent to EUR36.77 and Switzerland's UBS declined 2.4 per cent to SFr14.23.
European carmakers also contributed to the region's losses after Germany's Daimler reported a worse than 
expected first-quarter loss of EUR1.29bn compared with net income of EUR1.3bn a year ago. The German maker 
of luxury cars, including Mercedes-Benz, fell 3.7 per cent to EUR26.38.
The wider motor industry suffered, with Daimler peer BMW down 4.4 per cent to EUR25.98, Italy's Fiat 2.6 per cent 
lower at EUR7.83 and France's Renault ceding 5.2 per cent to EUR21.74.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of leading shares closed 1.5 per cent lower at 801.24 points. Germany's Xetra Dax 
index fell 1.8 per cent to 4,607.42 points and France's CAC 40 lost 1.6 per cent to 3,051.02 points.
Though the global health scare might not have been behind the fall for financials, it was certainly still on investors' 
minds and continued to push stocks down.
HSBC said: "A possible swine flu pandemic might be arriving at a time when the global economy is on its knees and 
risk appetite is still fragile.
Profit-taking undermines Deutsche Bank
"Whether investors take money out of the market here will depend, among other things, on their confidence in their 
ability to call the severity of the outbreak . . . other investors' responses and on whether they see a secular bear 
market continuing, and so are pre-disposed to sell the rally anyway."
HSBC added: "In 2003, the worst news on Sars didn't prevent the global market from rallying."
Travel and tourism stocks sustained steep losses for a second day.
Accor , Europe's leading hotelier, lost 4.7 per cent to EUR29.99, having fallen 3.8 per cent in the previous session.
Among airline operators, Ireland's Ryanair lost 5.4 per cent to EUR3.12 and Air France  fell 1.9 per cent to 
EUR8.23.
Citigroup also looked to Sars as an indicator of what might happen, in particular with European airlines. It said 
weakened stocks could bring buying opportunities.
"Low-cost airlines' earnings were unaffected and airports experienced a mild decline with the flag carriers most 
affected, although BA recovered earlier than the others," said Citi. "Within six months of the outbreak, earnings 
were recovering strongly."
Pernod Ricard  was one of only a handful of stocks rising on the CAC 40. A EUR1bn euro rights issue launched by 
the French drinks group this month ends today.
Aviate Global, the boutique brokerage, noted that "other companies with similar rights issues have performed well 
subsequently", citing Lafarge, the construction group, which has rallied 43 per cent since its rights subscription 
began. Pernod rose 0.4 per cent to EUR42.35.
The World Steel Association on Monday warned that global demand would fall by 15 per cent in 2009 as carmakers 
and builders cut production. ArcelorMittal , which is expected to post a second consecutive quarterly loss today, 
fell 6 per cent to EUR18.67 - the worst drop on the CAC 40. German rival ThyssenKrupp fell 4.1 per cent to 
EUR16.51.

Airline's share price drops almost 20%
Body
Aer Lingus, the Irish airline that has been under hostile takeover pressure from Ryanair for more than two years, 
issued a profit warning yesterday and said trading conditions had deteriorated rapidly during the first three months 
of the year.
The airline, which is currently without a chief executive following the resignation this month of Dermot Mannion, 
forecast a loss for 2009 "materially below the bottom of the range of current market expectations".
The airline's share price fell almost 20 per cent, or 14 cents, to close at 56 cents.
Stephen Furlong, aviation analyst at Davy, the Irish stockbroker, said his forecast operating loss for the year for Aer 
Lingus was likely to be more than doubled from EUR41.9m to close to EUR100m (£89m).
He said the airline "faces particular problems given its geographic position and strategic exposure, especially on 
long haul", where the network is exclusively focused on the US.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and has had two 
takeover bids thwarted, warned yesterday its smaller rival would "run out of cash in two years. Then it will have to 
come back to shareholders for more money".
Aer Lingus said the airline industry was facing "an exceptionally tough trading environment that has progressively 
deteriorated this year". There had been a rapid deterioration in the prospects for many major carriers and this was 
likely to be exacerbated by concerns about the impact of swine flu on demand.
The airline has made deep cuts in capacity, in particular on long-haul routes, but it said further cost reductions were 
"critical for the viability" of the group.
Aer Lingus warns on profits after trading conditions deteriorate further
Average fares on short-haul flights fell 1.6 per cent in the first two months of the year but then collapsed 23.6 per 
cent in March, bringing the quarter down 10.8 per cent year-on-year.
Total revenues fell 16 per cent in the quarter while passenger numbers declined 5.7 per cent on short-haul and 12.5 
per cent on long-haul flights. Aer Lingus cut short-haul capacity by 4.5 per cent and long-haul capacity by 19.5 per 
cent as it tried to keep pace with the collapse in demand.
The group's net cash fell from EUR653.9m to EUR593.6m in the quarter. Although the group still has a strong 
balance sheet, investors have become concerned about the rate of deterioration.
Aer Lingus is conducting an urgent review of its outstanding orders from Airbus.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the airline would save EUR50m (£44.7m) a year by moving 
exclusively to online check-in, writes Kevin Done .
Ryanair is planning to abandon all check-in desks at its airports in Europe from October, keeping only a small 
number of desks for passengers to drop off bags to be carried in the hold.
Ryanair, the biggest short-haul carrier in Europe measured by passenger numbers, said it was planning to carry 
67m passengers in the financial year to March 2010, up from 58m year ago.
It will be the first airline in Europe to abandon airport check-in as it seeks to drive down airport handling costs.
It is forcing passengers to change behaviour and has steadily increased charges for those with hold baggage. Mr 
O'Leary said the share of passengers with hold bags had been cut from 80 per cent before charges were imposed 
to about 25 per cent.
About 60 per cent of Ryanair passengers are already using online check-in and printing their own boarding cards.
Mr O'Leary said the move would transform the passenger experience at the airport, eliminating queues at check-in 
and shortening the time passengers needed to arrive before departures.

Shares in Aer Lingus nosedived Tuesday after the Irish airline warned that losses this year will be worse than 
expected leading its major shareholder and business rival, Ryanair, to forecast its doom.
Aer Lingus shares closed down 19 percent at €0.56 ($0.73) after the company told the Irish Stock Exchange it must 
increase its estimates for 2009 losses. The airline cited the deepening recession at home and declining demand on 
its U.S. routes for its second downgrade in outlook in recent weeks.
Aer Lingus' hostile suitor and chief competitor, Ryanair, forecast that the formerly state-owned airline would not 
survive the recession unless Ryanair took charge.
"Clearly there's going to be another restructuring and I think Aer Lingus is going to run out of cash," said Ryanair 
chief executive Michael O'Leary, who has twice tried to acquire the airline since its privatization in 2006.
Ryanair has become Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder, with a 30-percent stake, but the Irish government has 
retained a blocking 25 percent stake.
O'Leary forecast that the government itself struggling to combat a surging deficit and desperate for income would 
eventually approach Ryanair and make an offer much lower than Ryanair's lapsed 2008 offer of €1.40 per share. 
He mocked the worth of Aer Lingus stock, saying he would prefer if Ryanair could write off its investment as a total 
loss now.
"I don't think we'll make a third bid. We've tried twice. The next time the government will have to come and ask us to 
help rescue Aer Lingus," said O'Leary, whose own airline renowned for its aggressive marketing, vast network of 
provincial airports and hostility to labor unions has fared best among European airlines during the recession.
Aer Lingus declined to provide any officials for interview. The airline lost its chief executive, Dermot Mannion, to a 
surprise resignation three weeks ago. It has spent years trying to compete with Ryanair without losing its appeal as 
a more comfortable alternative.
Irish airline Aer Lingus issues profit warning
Aer Lingus declined to specify any new loss estimates for 2009 beyond its expectation they would significantly 
exceed the previous warning of €50 million ($65 million). Aviation analysts said the airline appeared on course to 
lose approximately €100 million ($130 million) instead.
In a statement, chairman Colm Barrington said the airline was struggling "against the backdrop of a severe 
deterioration in operating conditions," but was "resolute in its objective of reducing operating costs and retaining a 
strong capital structure."
Aer Lingus said sales fell 16 percent in the first three months of 2009 versus the same period last year and average 
fares fell 14.5 percent. Passenger numbers declined 6.5 percent to 2.1 million, most notably on its United States 
routes.
Most alarmingly, Aer Lingus said its strong cash reserve the legacy of its September 2006 flotation fell 9.2 percent 
in the past three months to €593.6 million.
The airline attributed the rapid cash burn to the cost of paying off unionized workers losing their jobs a cost that 
won't go away if Aer Lingus must cut more unionized staff. It warned that the next round of cost-cutting would likely 
mean reducing U.S. services and canceling or delaying orders for long-haul Airbus jets.
The chances of an eventual Ryanair takeover will be debated at Aer Lingus' annual shareholder meeting June 5. 
Ryanair has been denied seats on the board despite its status as the biggest shareholder.

The Dublin shares market slumped this morning as shares in Aer Lingus plunged after the airline issued a stark 
warning on profits.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 49.57 points to 2,379.46.
Aer Lingus says that it expects the average fare trend for full year 2009 to be worse than previously expected. 
Consequently, it currently forecasts that the loss for the 2009 full year will be materially below the bottom of the 
range of current market expectations. Long-haul average fare fell 14pc in the two months to end-February but 
declined by 25.7pc in March, with the quarter down by 18.9pc year-on-year (yoy). Short-haul average fare fell by 
1.6pc in the first two months to end-February but by 23.6pc in March, with the quarter down 10.8pc yoy. Based on 
the above statement, we will likely have to downgrade our E41.9m operating loss for 2009. Each 1pc decline in 
yield (we currently assume -14pc) affects this number by about E10m.
Shares in the airline slumped by 12c to E0.57. Ryanair was down 18c to E3.12. European stocks tumbled this 
morning, hit by growing fears about the economic impact of the swine flu outbreak and renewed concerns over 
capital increases in the banking sector. Airline and leisure stocks were particularly badly hit. London's FTSE lost 81 
points (1.9pc) to stand at 4,086 by 11am with shares in British Airways down 5.6pc. The Paris CAC slumped 75 
points (2.5pc) to stand at 3,027 and the Frankfurt DAX dropped 122 points (2.6pc) to 4,572. Production at oil and 
gas explorer, Dragon Oil rose by 19pc in the first quarter of the year. The Irish headquartered firm said it produced 
43,787 barrels per day (bpd) of oil in quarter one 2009 compared to 36,784 bpd in quarter one 2008. Shares in the 
firm rose by 10c to E2.61. The AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) has 
issued a detailed 130-page report on highway and public transportation needs. Based on pretty modest travel 
growth projections of 1-1.4pc per annum for the period 2010-15, it estimates an annual investment requirement of 
USD132-166bn. This compares to a current annualised run-rate for highway construction of circa USD80bn. Shares

in CRH fell by 13c to E17.27. Aryzta confirmed yesterday evening that it has had legal proceedings taken against it 
by Varleigh Ltd (a property vehicle owned by developer Bernard McNamara and James Morrissey). The dispute 
relates to "broken commitments" concerning an alleged agreement for the development of land for a new town 
centre in Tallaght, Dublin. Varleigh claims that due to a commitment by Aryzta to develop an adjoining site, it 
purchased a site in Tallaght for E52m in October 2006. Following Aryzta's decision to pull out of the development 
plan in mid 2007, it granted Mr McNamee (a former Aryzta executive) an option to acquire its eight acres in Tallaght 
for E48 million (exercisable post 31July 2009). Varleigh claims this eight acre site is now only worth E33.6 million 
and that it would not have bought the original site were it not for the intentions expressed by Aryzta at that time. It 
also claims the value of the site would now be worth up to E117m had Aryzta honoured the alleged original 
agreement. Shares in the food group fell by 32c to E21.18.

by Varleigh Ltd (a property vehicle owned by developer Bernard McNamara and James Morrissey). The dispute 
relates to "broken commitments" concerning an alleged agreement for the development of land for a new town

purchased a site in Tallaght for E52m in October 2006. Following Aryzta's decision to pull out of the development 
plan in mid 2007, it granted Mr McNamee (a former Aryzta executive) an option to acquire its eight acres in Tallaght 
for E48 million (exercisable post 31July 2009). Varleigh claims this eight acre site is now only worth E33.6 million

The Dublin shares market slumped this morning as shares in Aer Lingus plunged after the airline issued a stark 
warning on profits.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 49.57 points to 2,379.46.
Aer Lingus says that it expects the average fare trend for full year 2009 to be worse than previously expected. 
Consequently, it currently forecasts that the loss for the 2009 full year will be materially below the bottom of the 
range of current market expectations. Long-haul average fare fell 14pc in the two months to end-February but 
declined by 25.7pc in March, with the quarter down by 18.9pc year-on-year (yoy). Short-haul average fare fell by 
1.6pc in the first two months to end-February but by 23.6pc in March, with the quarter down 10.8pc yoy. Based on 
the above statement, we will likely have to downgrade our E41.9m operating loss for 2009. Each 1pc decline in 
yield (we currently assume -14pc) affects this number by about E10m.
Shares in the airline slumped by 12c to E0.57. Ryanair was down 18c to E3.12. European stocks tumbled this 
morning, hit by growing fears about the economic impact of the swine flu outbreak and renewed concerns over 
capital increases in the banking sector. Airline and leisure stocks were particularly badly hit. London's FTSE lost 81 
points (1.9pc) to stand at 4,086 by 11am with shares in British Airways down 5.6pc. The Paris CAC slumped 75 
points (2.5pc) to stand at 3,027 and the Frankfurt DAX dropped 122 points (2.6pc) to 4,572. Production at oil and 
gas explorer, Dragon Oil rose by 19pc in the first quarter of the year. The Irish headquartered firm said it produced 
43,787 barrels per day (bpd) of oil in quarter one 2009 compared to 36,784 bpd in quarter one 2008. Shares in the

All airlines 'unprofitable' in first quarter

UK airlines saw shares drop in early trading after a warning from Citigroup that all the carriers in Europe would be 
loss-making in the first quarter of 2009.
In a note which further punished the sector following yesterday's swine flu outbreak, Citi said it expected to see 
record losses across the board when airlines revealed their first three months of trading, because of a sharp fall in 
business travel and air cargo, a passenger decline and the timing of the Easter holiday.
Citi which added there may be a possible recovery in 2010 also said most airlines would likely make a loss in 2009 
as a whole, with easyJet and Ryanair among just four profitable businesses.
Citi said: 'We expect a collective operating loss of 1.8 billion in 1Q09. Underlying revenue decline expected to be 
10%, driven by 20-25% revenue falls in B2B, an 8% overall passenger decline and later timing of Easter.
'All airlines are expected to have been unprofitable.'
It also warned of more cost cutting and capacity reductions to come, adding that of the three UK listed airlines, 
British Airways may need to raise financing via an equity raising by 2010.
Citi added legacy fuel hedges where airlines have agreed a deal to buy oil at a certain price which is higher than 
current levels were another burden on the sector.
While leaving its rating unchanged on BA and Ryanair, Citi also cut easyJet to a 'hold' from a 'buy'.
In reaction, shares in all three airlines were lower by 08:46am. easyJet shed 5.7% or 18.25p, to 302p, while Ryanair 
was off 3.8% or 0.125, at 3.185. BA was down 3.2% or 4.9p, to 146.3p.

Ryanair today said that it will allow "price comparison only" websites to access its timetable and pricing information.
Ryanair will introduce a licence agreement where, for a small annual charitable donation of E100, price comparison 
only websites, which provide fare comparison and seat availability information to consumers will be authorised to 
access Ryanair's website.
"Ryanair will continue to ban reselling "ticket-tout" screenscraper websites which rip-off consumers by their 
unauthorised reselling of Ryanair flights at inflated prices and in some cases fictitious surcharges," it said.
"Ryanair will continue to fight against "ticket-tout" screenscrapers which are reselling Ryanair seats without 
authorisation and are ripping off consumers with inflated fares and fictitious fuel surcharges. Thomas Cook recently 
admitted overcharging one Ryanair passenger £243 by applying a non-existent fuel surcharge of £160 and inflating 
Ryanair's fare by £83," Michael O'Leary said.

Aer Lingus shares have dived by 23pc in early trading after the airline issued a stark new profit warning this 
morning.
The shares fell by 16c to 53 after it said revenue dropped 16pc in the first quarter and losses this year would be 
even more than feared.
Analysts feel the airline's shares would have dropped anyway this morning because of falls in carriers' shares 
around the world because of the swine flue scare.
Ryanair shares are down by 11c this morning to 318. Overall the ISEQ index was 45.30 points lower a short time 
ago at 2,383.73. Bank shares were down, in line with their counterparts globally on a report that two big US banks 
will need more capital. AIB was down 7c a short time ago at 77, with Bank of Ireland off by 4c to 60. Irish Life and 
Permanent was down 4c to 160. Among other big shares, CRH is down 19c to 1721, DCC is off by 30c to 1315 and

Body
Fears that the flu outbreak could spread to a global pandemic sent global shares falling sharply yesterday and held 
Irish shares back from making any real gains.
The ISEQ rose 8.04 points to 2,429.03.
Strong headway among heavyweight pharmaceutical shares could not prevent leading indices across Europe and 
Asia sliding into the red, as the value of airlines' stocks plunged on worries that governments could impose travel 
restrictions.
European shares recovered to end higher on Monday after being under pressure for most of the day on fears of a 
swine flu pandemic, with drugmakers up on hopes of more vaccine demand and other defensives also rising. The 
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares provisionally closed 0.5 percent higher at 814.67 points after falling 
as low as 795.54 points. On Wall Street the S and P 500 and Nasdaq briefly turned lower Monday, and the Dow 
Jones industrial average pared gains, after the World Health Organisation commented on the swine flu outbreak. In 
Geneva, a WHO emergency committee could raise its pandemic alert level to phase 4 or 5 as a deadly swine flu 
outbreak shows no signs of slowing, a spokesman said. Shares in Aer Lingus, whose long-haul services to the US 
have been hit hard by the global recession, fell by 3c to E0.70 while Ryanair declined by 15c to E3.30. Both sets of 
stocks were also hit by predictions that the price of a barrel of oil will average USD51c this year. Shares in AIB fell 
by 1c to E0.84, Bank of Ireland declined by 2c to E0.64 and Irish Life and Permanent lost 5c to E1.64. Aviva's first 
quarter results reveals worldwide life and pensions sales up by 11pc to £9.6bn, a general insurance COR in line 
with its 'meet or beat' target of 98pc and an IGD solvency surplus of £2.5bn (£2bn at end-2008) after deducting the 
final dividend. Its Irish sales were down by 43pc, reflecting 'reduced demand across both retail and bancassurance 
channels with consumers being deterred by volatile equity markets, the slowdown in economic growth and property 
market uncertainty'. Aviva notes that this is in line with the sharp decline in the Irish life and pensions market: recent 
ISEQ held back by flu pandemic fears ISEQ Up
figures from Life Strategies showed that APE across the Irish life insurance industry fell by 45pc to E226m in Q1 
2009 from E404m during the same period last year. Shares in insurer, FBD fell by 31c to E6.10. Kingspan's share 
price has performed strongly over the last month and is now up over 30pc. "From a cyclical point of view, the 
newsflow from Ireland (7pc of group sales) continues to be negative and mainland Europe (31pc of group sales) is 
probably sluggish (especially in Eastern Europe, 12pc of group sales), which has not been helped by poor weather 
in Q1. In the UK (Kingspan's biggest market at over 40pc of group sales), the incremental newsflow on the 
residential market has been more positive in recent weeks, which supports the view that we are near the bottom," 
said Goodbody Stockbrokers. Its stock gained 3c to E3.61 yesterday.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said he expects to see a double-digit percentage rise in its passenger 
traffic in April, helped by the Easter holiday.
Easter fell in March last year.
He was speaking at a news conference to announce the launch of a mobile phone service on board its Rome-
based fleet.
Mr O'Leary also said Ryanair expected to save E30 to E40m a year by eliminating check-in desks and making 
online check-in mandatory from October. He said Ryanair was continuing discussions with Airbus and Boeing for a 
large aircraft order but that 'neither has met our pricing objective' so far. Mr O'Leary has previously said that 
Ryanair plans to order 200 planes for as much as USD7 billion, with delivery starting in 2013, and would pick the 
plane maker that offers the cheaper price despite the airline's historic relationship with Boeing.

by further losses from AIB and Bank of Ireland.
Body
The Dublin shares market inched in to positive territory this morning, helped by Aer Lingus but held bank by further 
losses from AIB and Bank of Ireland.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 5.64 points at 2,452.08.
Shares in Aer Lingus gained by 3c to E0.72 after it said it had appointed search consultants to advise on the 
appointment of a new chief executive for the airline. Ryanair went in the opposite direction, losing 6c to E3.36 as 
crude oil prices edged higher on the global markets.
Britain's economic figures that emerged from Wednesday's Budget painted a bleak picture with Davy noting that, in 
fact, the UK's position is actually worse than Ireland's. The UK Treasury forecasts that the General Government 
Deficit (on the EU's Maastricht basis) will hit 12.6pc this year. That 2009 number will exceed the equivalent Irish 
ratio by almost two percentage points, if the Department of Finance's target is met. Moreover, gross debt to GDP is 
set to remain much higher in the UK than in Ireland. London's FTSE was up 23 points (0.5pc) to stand at 4,054 
while the Paris CAC added nine points (0.3pc) to 3,034 and the Frankfurt DAX slipped three points (0.1pc) to 4,591. 
Shares in Irish Life and Permanent helped to keep the ISEQ above water with the stocks gaining 11c to E1.93 after 
it announced that Springboard Mortgages - the Irish Life and Permanent-owned specialist mortgage lender will stop 
accepting applications for new mortgage loans from today. The company focuses on mortgage lending to the 
specialist or "near prime" market and added that it will stop advancing any new loans from the end of June. The 
company was established in December 2006 as a joint venture between Irish Life and Permanent and Merrill Lynch 
but IL and P became sole owner in June 2008 when Merrill Lynch internationally decided to exit the sub-prime 
lending market. The company worked exclusively through the broker channel and in the last two and a half years, 
the company has advanced approximately E500 million in loans. Shares in AIB, however, fell by 6c to E0.87 and 
Bank of Ireland declined by 3c to E0.69. Greene King has said that trading conditions across the group have

generally improved despite worsening economic conditions since its last update at end-January. Greene King 
operates some 2,500 pubs and restaurants and two breweries in the UK. Like-for-like sales for the 49 weeks to April 
12th in its managed pubs and branded restaurants increased 0.8pc. Shares in C and C rose by 11c to E1.69. The 
move in the UK Budget to cut pension tax relief on top incomes is unlikely to have much of an effect on IFG's UK 
pensioneer business, according to Davy Research. Income from this business is derived from the structuring and 
administration of pensions rather than the value of amounts contributed or managed within them. Shares in IFG 
were flat a t E0.60.

Pity the pioneer. Southwest Airlines invented low-cost air travel, inspiring imitators around the world. But the US 
carrier last week announced its first quarterly loss in 18 years and was forced to halt decades of relentless 
expansion by deferring delivery of new aircraft. Are there lessons here for other budget carriers?
In part, Southwest has been a victim of its own success. Stiff competition pushed several of America's legacy 
airlines into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, forcing them to cut costs and thus erode Southwest's advantage 
when they emerged. Indeed, thanks to aggressive route expansion, Southwest's aircraft typically now fly with a 
lower proportion of seats filled than competitors. Furthermore, there is now a budget choice on about 40 per cent of 
US routes, compared with 30 per cent in Europe (and perhaps half that level in Asia, where Malaysia's AirAsia 
continues to expand).
That suggests there is room for more growth in Europe, where Ryanair and EasyJet still boast costs per passenger 
half that of the flag carriers. And a recession can be an excellent time to expand. In 2002-03, Ryanair showed how 
cutting prices can boost demand by posting record growth of profits and sales. Even this year, it is expected to 
increase traffic by 10 per cent. EasyJet, while taking a more cautious approach, still expects profits this year.
The other main transatlantic difference is the approach to charges. Ryanair will make about a fifth of sales this year 
from ancillary revenues and is considering new fees for the overweight or even for using toilets in-flight. Southwest, 
by contrast, trumpets its lack of hidden fees as a competitive advantage. Given the US carrier's underperformance 
against the two European upstarts since the credit crunch began, it may be time for the old hand to learn some new 
tricks.

the ISEQ rose by 59.54 points to 2,446.44.
Positive comments from US company executives about the state of the global economy after a mixed bag of first-

sharply higher in early trading.
In Britain, the leading FTSE 100 index fell after a downbeat UK budget, with insurers knocked by pension relief 
curbs, while banks saw gains eroded after weak Morgan Stanley results. Sterling slumped against the euro and the 
US dollar as the frightening extent of the UK's recession became apparent. He reduced his forecast for the British 
economy, saying he expected it to shrink by 3.5pc in the current year. But he said the UK economy would grow by 
1.25pc in 2010, while retail price inflation - which includes mortgage repayments - would reach -3pc by September. 
Back home, Irish bank shares failed to make much of an impression as the market awaits more details on the 
NAMA bad bank. Shares in AIB rose 1c to E0.91, Bank of Ireland was gained 2c to E0.72 and Irish Life and 
Permanent edged down 5c to E1.80. US regional bank, M and T, in which AIB has a 26pc stake, yesterday 
announced Q1 results, with adjusted EPS of 59c versus consensus of 71c and a decline of 70pc against the same 
quarter last year. The top line was weaker with net interest income falling to USD448m from USD486m in Q4, as a 
result of a decline in the net interest margin from 3.37pc to 3.17pc. Elan has reported a pre-tax loss of USD88.6m 
for the first quarter of 2009, an increase on the pre-tax loss figure of USD83.4m for the same time last year. 
Revenues rose by 14pc to USD245.1m from USD214.7m mainly as a result of a strong performance from Elan's 
multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. Elan's shares jumped 22c to E4.47. Heineken has reported Q1 sales numbers this 
morning (April 22nd). Volumes were weaker than the market expected. Group organic volume declined -6.3pc, and 
volume of the Heineken brand fell by -5.8pc. Organic revenues were down -1pc with pricing partially compensating 
for the volume fall. Organic EBIT decreased by low single digits. Shares in Ireland's C and C gained by 4c to E1.55. 
ISEQ makes strong headway, Elan rises ISEQ Up
Ryanair Michael O'Leary said that he sees a substantial profit increase in the coming 12 months. Goodbody's pre-
tax profit forecast for the year just finished is pencilled in at E82m to move to an estimated E422.6m in 2010. The 
airline is likely to provide fuller guidance at the end of the year results on June 2. On the revenue side, Ryanair 
appears to be reiterating its earlier guidance of carrying up to 67m passengers in the current year as compared to 
Goodbody's 67.4m forecast. This would deliver the 15pc growth figure on passenger volumes that the company is 
budgeting. Elsewhere, Mr O'Leary indicated that April traffic will be "very strong", presumably helped by Easter, and 
should see a "double-digit" increase in passengers. Shares in Ryanair rose by 12c to E3.42.

Ryanair has threatened to pull out of its base at Dusseldorf-Weeze if the decision by the OVG Court in Munster to 
restrict the airport's operating hours is not overturned.
Ryanair has today stopped accepting bookings on all flights affected by the change in the airport's operating hours.
The airline will review the Court's decision with the Airport and its lawyers but confirmed that the base will close if 
the court decision to restrict operating hours is not overturned by Wednesday 29th April.
Ryanair currently operates 6 based aircraft at Dusseldorf -Weeze, which deliver 2.5m passengers p.a. and sustain 
2,500 local jobs, most of which will be lost if Ryanair closes its base at the airport. Ryanair's Deputy Chief 
Executive, Michael Cawley, said: "Ryanair and Dusseldorf-Weeze airport have been a huge success story for the 
entire region. We have grown our routes and passenger numbers rapidly but the OVG Court decision will result in 
the loss of 2,500 local jobs and Ryanair's 2.5million passengers p.a. if this unworkable, unfair and unnecessary 
restriction to operating times is enforced.

(ANSA) - APRIL 21   Starting from the end of April it will  be possible to telephone, send text messages and emails 
from the  five Ryanair planes based at Rome s Ciampino airport. The aim of  the low cost airline is to equip its fleet 
of 180 Boeing  737-800s with mobile telephone service. The Irish company, after  equipping its Dublin base, 
decided to bring the technology to  Italy before expanding to its other planes based in different  countries.  Using 
OnAir, a communications system installed onboard the  plane, at international roaming rates, passengers can 
receive  and send calls (2-3 euros a minute), text messages (about .50  euros) and email (1-2 euros) from their 
mobile phones,  Blackberrys and Smartphones. The service is available for  customers with over 50 providers all 
over Europe, including the  four Italian companies (Tim, Vodafone Omniltel, Wind and 3  Italia).

All organisations, not just media, are facing unprecedented challenges in dealing with the realities of new media 
according to a report by VINT, the Research Institute of IT services company, Sogeti.
"We are in the middle of the third media revolution which is driven by the Internet. This is turning traditional 
relationships involving brands, organisations, politicians and the public on their heads," according to Menno van 
Doorn, director of the research centre of the Sogeti Group and co-author of "Me the Media - Rise of the 
Conversation Society - Past, Present and Future of the Third Media Revolution" which is launched in Ireland today.
Mr van Doorn said that the rise of social media such as blogs, You Tube and My Space means that the consumer is 
taking charge rather than companies, authorities, traditional media and politicians. "Those organisations who don't 
engage will find themselves disconnected from their employees, their customers and the rules of 21st century value 
creation. Those who do, will profit from a new economic eco-system where customers, employees and 
organisations interact with each other in a totally different way. "
"We are already seeing in Ireland the impact of new social media such as bloggers and the contrasting attitudes to 
this by organisations such as Bord Gais and Ryanair," commented Declan Kavanagh, managing director, Sogeti 
Ireland. Mr Kavanagh said that 80pc of 18-26 year olds are actively involved in web media such as blogs and social 
networks. "But companies should also be observing social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook which are 
fast becoming household names. We are at the start of a media mass era in which we ourselves and everything 
around us becomes media. Traditional pyramid organisation structures are being torn down. Those organisations 
that fail to respond to the new conversation society face real threats to survival." Mr van Doorn emphasised that the 
third media revolution is bringing profound economic consequences. "Relationships between organisations and 
customers are changing and the economic game is increasingly being played out in the open. This means that 
organisations must adapt to the mores of a new virtual reality. As in the previous era, the customer remains key but

only now is that real." He said that the new communications will require a cultural change amongst all 
organisations. "The forthright and transparent tone of web conversation is in complete contrast to the top down 
organisation speak of previous generations. But for those companies who embrace the new realities this is also 
creating an opportunity for the first time to enter into direct one-on-one contact with the, until very recently, 
anonymous public."

Different surveys - many of which we reported on these pages - have suggested that people are kinder to one 
another in a recession. They are starting to think less about indulging themselves, and more about being good to 
others, and they are open once again to things like gallows humour. They are wallowing in cosy nostalgia.
This mood has begun to be reflected in media and advertising. Obviously no company wants to be seen to be 
making capital out of anyone's distress so - with the unapologetically rude Ryanair naturally excepted - there's been 
little in recent months in the way of the nasty, aggressive marketing that had started to appear in the past few years. 
Lack of spare cash seems to be a leveller for consumers, and advertisers know it.
Instead of madly clawing up the ladder, we're all more content these days to hang around on the ground, having a 
chat with the chap next door (or, in practice, having a nice chat on Facebook with our mates).
All of a sudden, people are talking about doing charity work. At the height of the Celtic tiger era, nobody had time to 
spare. A crowd of media types are even preparing to leap out of a plane together, just for the sake of it.
The Sunday Business Post columnist Tom McGurk, who is now also the drive time presenter on 4FM, recently 
devoted a long segment of his show to a chat with a granny who had done a parachute jump as a present for her 
husband (to show him she could).
It's hard to imagine this making it to a drivetime slot on Newstalk or on RTE 1, but charming just the same.
A new music station aimed at the over-45s, 4FM seems to have tapped into a touchy-feely vibe more than most, 
possibly by accident. So, while it covers serious news items, it enlivens the most depressing mood with a nice song 
or two.
MEDIA WORLD
Former finance minister Ruairí Quinn was talking a week or so back with Damien Kiberd on 4FM, intoning solemnly 
about the need for Ireland to decide for once and for all if it wants to ape the European or the US economic model. 
Then a cheerful blast of California Girls blew all the sorrow away.
Once you recover from the shock, this is almost as good a tonic as the RTE digital kids' radio station (currently only 
available on digital radio), which is just about the only media outlet that's blissfully devoid of all news, bad or good.
Rabobank is also typifying the trend, with all its talk of essential ''truths'' in its current ad campaign.
Rabobank has always been innovative in its marketing. Without its trailblazing, straight talking approach we might 
never have had the Halifax ''bankers'' or the more recent ''nononsense.ie'' campaign from FBD Insurance.
Now it's taking things a step further, with a nice jolly blog on its website, nice jolly staff telling nice jolly secrets 
online and a website - truthbank.ie - that invites people to share honest revelations of their own. It's all just quite 
nice isn't it? A silver lining . . .

Ryanair today called on Gordon Brown to scrap his £10 tourist tax as BAA March figures confirm the decline of 
passenger traffic to and from the UK.
Ryanair urged the Labour Government to follow the recent examples of Belgium and Holland which scrapped their 
tourist taxes to encourage tourism.
Ryanair warned that the BAA figures, which reported an 11pc decline in March traffic, with 1 million fewer 
passengers, confirm that "British tourism is collapsing due to the Government's stupid policy of taxing tourists. 
Ryanair confirmed that if this collapse continues it will result in the loss of 12 million passengers and 12,000 jobs at 
UK airports this year".
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "British passenger traffic has collapsed and Gordon Brown must reverse his 
suicidal £10 tourist tax to address the rapid loss of passenger traffic, the loss of billions in tourism revenues and 
taxes and the loss of thousands of jobs."

fewer lenders in the market - just seven to 10, compared to between 30 and 40 offering loans just two years ago. 
Lenders had also become "more risk averse". This meant that there would have to be "guarantees from the public

(ANSA)   ROME, Apr 14   Ryanair  has appealed to ENAC, the  Italian Authority for Civil Aviation, to assume legal  
responsibility for the safety of passengers and airlines  operating in Rome s international airports and to begin 
working  on the risks associated with birds near the city s airports .  The information was relayed by a statement by 
the company,  saying they had  gone to ENAC repeatedly, asking it to assume  responsibility for storm control, 
which is a large security risk  in Rome . According to Ryanair,  ENAC has repeatedly avoided its legal  obligations, 
and has instead unfairly sought to pass  responsibility to the airport workers . The company, Europe s  largest low-
cost airline, says it has been  forced to take legal  action, by way of the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, in  
order to force ENAC to accept its responsibilities and to  eliminate the risks in order to ensure the safety of the crew  
and passengers of flights into and out of Rome .   Ryanair has repeatedly asked ENAC to accept responsibility for  
the security of passengers who fly in and out of Rome, and to  monitor the great number of storms which create 
significant  risks in the city of Rome , said the company s manager Stephen  McNamara:  ENAC has refused to 
commit itself to this problem and  its effects on the security of Rome s air-traffic, and for this  Ryanair is taking legal 
action through the Regional  Administrative Court of Lazio in order to ensure that ENAC  assumes the responsibility 
of protecting the security of who  lands and takes off from Rome .

Simon Kingsnorth is head of human resources with HSBC Ireland. The British-owned group is celebrating its 30th 
year in the Irish market, where it employs 550 staff at offices on Grand Canal Square in Dublin. It recently 
announced plans to open a new global hub for reinsurance.
The move will create 15 new jobs within its 25-strong reinsurance team, which has assets totalling more than 
US$698 million. Globally, HSBC has 100 million customers in 85 countries and territories. It employs 335,000 staff 
and has assets of $2,537 billion.
What are the main responsibilities of your job?
I am responsible for the HR function for HSBC in Ireland. This includes all people policies and administration, 
recruitment, induction, metrics and engagement programmes. I am currently recruiting staff for our new reinsurance 
hub, in highly skilled actuarial, compliance, risk and underwriting roles.
What are your primary professional motivators?
To make every place I work a great place to work. Engagement is critical to performance, and so my focus is on 
policies and practices that enhance engagement within HSBC.
How would you describe your work style?
I am creative, approachable, open to ideas, enthusiastic, driven to achieve results and fun.
What would you rate as the best decision you ever made in business? Reviewing my career in my late 30s to move 
from sales into HR.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learnt so far?
Working Week
Bring people with you when proposing change and understand their personal and professional motivators. 
Everyone approaches change differently. In order to ensure successful outcomes, you really need to understand 
your stakeholders.
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
I have followed with admiration, and often amusement, the fortunes of Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. He takes every 
opportunity to generate publicity for the company, however controversial. I admire his singlemindedness and 
consistent focus on strategy.
He brings a sense of fun to business and has created an airline Ireland can be proud of .
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
We are working in unprecedented times. We are dealing with a global economic downturn, which is creating 
particular challenges after a period of sustained growth. Conversely, HSBC Ireland is continuing to grow its 
business.
The new reinsurance hub is an exciting initiative for us and a great boost for our people. It shows that Ireland 
remains an excellent base for global financial services operations. We have an excellent skill and knowledgebase 
here, and we are well-placed for recovery when the global economy picks up.
What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?
To see HSBC Ireland reach financial goals and targets within all of its businesses - private and corporate banking, 
insurance and securities services. We aim to be at the heart of HSBC's group operations. I have no doubt that we 
have the talent and tenacity to be a great success, despite these turbulent times.

Aer Lingus shareholders will hope that, this time, the airline will move a little more quickly to fill the vacant position 
of chief executive than was the case when Willie Walsh resigned in 2005.
It took seven months for Dermot Mannion to take up the position following Walsh's departure, thanks to a relaxed 
recruitment drive pursued by the then semi-state airline and restrictions in Mannion's contract with previous 
employer Emirates.
Life as a publicly-quoted company, however, should speed things up this time around. But what does the airline, 
temporarily headed by chairman Colm Barrington, want - or need - in its new chief executive?
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary taunted his rival last week with the frivolous suggestion that trade unionist and 
current Aer Lingus director David Begg should be offered the position, reflecting O'Leary's long-standing perception 
that unions have too great a say in the running of the airline.
But he is more likely to care about the choice of Mannion's successor than he appeared last week.
Barrington's board is likely to place a premium on a replacement who can outline a clear strategy for maintaining 
Aer Lingus's independence, while offering O'Leary a more intense level of competition on routes out of Ireland.
Mannion, although passionate in rejecting Ryanair's two takeover bids, offered little to excite institutional investors. 
While the airline is far removed from the one he inherited, thanks to innovations such as new bases in Belfast and 
London Gatwick, the airline's first outside Dublin, Cork and Shannon, Mannion repeatedly struggled to convey the 
necessary urgency in driving down costs and picking out astute ways in which to grow the business.
He was not helped by the constant distraction caused by O'Leary's takeover ambitions and lack of success with 
early attempts to stamp his own authority on Aer Lingus, such as a new long-haul route to Dubai that failed to live 
up to expectations. His replacement will need to decide whether to persist with Mannion's other groundbreaking 
moves, such as the new bases in Belfast and Gatwick.
So who will fill the Aer Lingus hot seat?
Although the airline repeatedly stresses its satisfaction with routes from Belfast, it is running out of time to evolve 
from a start-up operation to a more mature business, with the passenger numbers and profitability that are required. 
Internal candidates to succeed Mannion include chief financial officer Sean Coyle and planning director Stephen 
Kavanagh, while Niall Walsh, Mannion's low-profile deputy chief executive, may also be a contender.
The elevation of Coyle would be a remarkable coup for the former Ryanair executive, who joined Aer Lingus less 
than a year ago, but his relatively short period with the airline may count against him.
Kavanagh, on the other hand, has come up through the Aer Lingus ranks but may suffer if the board wants a 
candidate with experience gained in other airlines.
Barrington's decision to take charge for the time being suggests the board will be happy with the airline industry 
veteran holding the reins for a limited spell. But with competitive pressures on the airline at least partly to blame for 
Mannion's exit, the need for the ''fresh thinking and new ideas'' that Mannion said his replacement ought to bring 
will become clear all too quickly.

Eirtight secures  150,000 online Mockexams deal

Dublin firm Eirtight has secured a  150,000 contract with a provider of online testing services to candidates in 
financial services. The deal, with Mockexams. ie, is to develop critical IT systems for the site, which provides mock 
exams to candidates training to become qualified financial advisers (QFAs).
John Beckett, commercial director of Eirtight Technology, said the deal was a prestigious win for the firm. The 
contract, awarded three months ago, will run for two years, with options for further increments after that time. It will 
enable Mockexams to expand its business in compliance and accountancy.
''This is a highly complex system for tracking, monitoring and providing questions and answers," said Beckett. ''We 
have effectively provided the initial version that is working, but there are new features and functionality that they 
wish to offer, so we will be doing that for the customer."
Eirtight developed the system without third-party tools or off-the-shelf software, an approach Beckett said was less 
expensive than investing in an existing software product.
''With bespoke software, you can customise it to meet the exact functionality you require. Off-the-shelf products are 
developed to be everything to everyone," he said. ''In many cases, you have companies trying to shoehorn that into 
their way of doing business. It ends up being less cost effective and more trouble than it was worth."
Eirtight was formed last year when Beckett merged two existing operations and acquired Data & Business 
Integration (DBI) , a custom software development company with operations in Romania. Prior to the merger, he 
ran Adrenalin Internet Systems, developer of the original Ryanair website, and biometrics and fingerprint scanning 
technology firm Byamsys, as separate businesses.
''There were a number of synergies between the companies. We had been working with DBI for several years and it 
made sense to come together," said Beckett.

The combined entity has 22 staff - five in Dublin and the remainder in Brasov in Romania. Beckett said the 
company was on course to record revenues of  1.5 million this year.
Eirtight also offers business process improvement services.
''We generate cost savings by delivering efficiency through technology. We look at businesses and see where 
technology can be implemented to improve them," said Beckett.
''The downturn has affected business positively for us because it makes our offering significantly more interesting to 
people. Many businesses are in a state of flux. We can deliver technology that can have a significant impact on the 
bottom line," he said.
Eirtight has diversified its business in the past year. At one stage, more than 60 per cent of its turnover came from 
computer giant Dell.
More recently, it has completed projects for more than 30 different customers, including insurance website 123.ie, 
IT provider CInfinity, software testing house SGS, housing developer McInerney and Vodafone subsidiary Perlico.

All eyes are on Leinster House today for the Supplementary Budget with investors hoping for a multi-year 
programme to get Ireland out of the mess it is in and to reanimate Ireland's financial system.
By 10:30, the ISEQ was down 1.32 points at 2,299.66.
Economists expect the government to aim for net savings of E3.5 billion for the whole of 2009, to close the deficit 
from 13pc to 11pc of GDP. Business lobby groups and some economists would ideally like to see the savings would 
come more from reducing the cost of public services rather than from raising extra revenue. Davy's Rossa White, 
among others, anticipate the opposite. Social welfare rates are probably on the table, as are certain current 
expenditure programmes, and there may well be an announcement of some redundancies in the public service.

programme to get Ireland out of the mess it is in and to reanimate Ireland's financial system.

Economists expect the government to aim for net savings of E3.5 billion for the whole of 2009, to close the deficit 
from 13pc to 11pc of GDP. Business lobby groups and some economists would ideally like to see the savings would 
come more from reducing the cost of public services rather than from raising extra revenue. Davy's Rossa White, 
among others, anticipate the opposite. Social welfare rates are probably on the table, as are certain current 
expenditure programmes, and there may well be an announcement of some redundancies in the public service.

News In Brief
## Almost 100 companies will be forced out of business every month by the end of 2009, a Dublin credit bureau has 
predicted. BusinessPro, which publishes Stubbs Gazette, expects that the rate of corporate collapses this year will 
almost double from 550 in 2008. Data collected by the bureau shows that 54 creditor liquidations took place in the 
first quarter of 2009, more than twice as many as in the same period a year earlier. A further 30 companies were 
wound up by the courts, up from an average of 15 winding-up orders a quarter last year, the bureau said. - Irish

## Workers who were paying into the Waterford Crystal pension fund up to the time the company went into 
receivership are set to get just one-fifth of what they could have expected in a pension. The schemes have been 
wound up in the past few days and now unions at the crystal plant are to take legal action against the government 
over what they say is a failure to protect their pension rights. Existing pensioners are set to continue to receive their 
retirement income, but the fact that the schemes have a 110m euro deficit means those yet to retire can expect a 
pension pot of just 20pc of what they could have expected. Unite union regional secretary Jimmy Kelly said 
yesterday that this means someone who could have expected a pension of 30,000 euro will just get 6,000 euro. -

## The Cork-Swansea ferry service could be up and running by next month if shareholders agree to a deal to 
purchase a new vessel, the MS Julia. A consortium of shareholders is expected to fully ratify the deal at a meeting 
in Skibbereen, west Cork tonight. The 28-year-old Finnish vessel, which was recently refitted, will undergo some 
minor alterations to comply with Irish maritime law. It is hoped that it can start sailing between Swansea and Cork 
before June. The deal also needs to be ratified by creditors of the Finnish firm that used to own the vessel. - Irish

Aer Lingus, the Irish airline that has been under take-over pressure from Ryanair for more than two years, 
announced yesterday that Dermot Mannion, its chief executive, had resigned.
Mr Mannion said his decision to step down would "allow a new CEO to bring fresh thinking and new ideas to the 
business".
Colm Barrington, chairman of the group, said the board had started the process of selecting a new chief executive 
and that he was taking over executive responsibility until a successor to Mr Mannion could be found.
The Aer Lingus share price has fallen in the past year from more than EUR2 to a low of under EUR0.57 in recent 
weeks before closing at EUR0.67 last Friday.
It rose 8.27 per cent to EUR0.72 yesterdayon the news of Mr Mannion's departure.
Mr Mannion, who joined the then Irish state-owned carrier four years ago, has led the airline through one of the 
most turbulent periods of its history. It was floated by Dublin in September 2006 after government hesitation had 
undermined several attempts at privatisation, but within days of the initial public offering it came under attack from 
local rival Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline.
Mr Mannion, who was recruited to Aer Lingus from Emirates, fought off two hostile takeover bids from Ryanair in 
two years with support from the Irish government, which still holds a 25.1 per cent stake.
But the resistance has come at a heavy price to investors.
Ryanair, which has taken big losses on its investment in Aer Lingus, is the biggest shareholder and still holds a 
stake of 29.8 per cent.
Mannion quits Aer Lingus to allow new ideas
It has kept up a heavy attack against Aer Lingus's efforts to thwart its takeover bids and has undermined the 
credibility of the group's management and the insistence on maintaining independence, as the share price has 
tumbled.
Aer Lingus profitability fell last year to a net loss of EUR107.8m (m$145) from a net profit of EUR105.3m a year 
earlier.
It fell to an operating loss of EUR17.6m, before employee profit share and net exceptional items, from a profit of 
EUR88.5m in 2007.
Along with other airlines it was hit hard by the   rise in fuel prices in the first half of last year and then by the growing 
impact of the recession.
Aer Lingus incurred restructuring costs of EUR117.5m as Mr Mannion struggled to reshape the group and cut costs 
to make it more competitive, not least against Ryanair.

Two airline departures: one unscheduled, one early - and both apparently prompted by fatigue. Aer Lingus chief 
Dermot Mannion's sudden take off , after a four-year stint, was unexpected. The former Emirates man was seen as 
a sound choice to put Aer Lingus on a sustainable heading after it listed in 2006. Yet his exit suggests he had tired 
of battling Ryanair at home and EasyJet and others abroad.
Meanwhile, Colin Chandler, EasyJet's chairman who steps down in July, had been expected to stay until the 
autumn, allowing time for Sir Michael Rake, his likely successor, to relinquish other commitments. But after a 
protracted public debate between Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the low-cost airline's founder, and the board over 
strategy, Mr Chandler's early bolt for the exit suggests he had had enough. Neither departure reflects well on the 
companies they leave.
Mr Mannion is leaving to "allow a new CEO to bring fresh thinking and new ideas to the business". Deeper cost 
cutting and a supportive majority shareholder are what Aer Lingus really needs. The latter may be too much to ask; 
Ryanair holds almost 30 per cent and has twice bid for the airline. EasyJet also has a tricky majority shareholder 
issue; Sir Stelios and his siblings own 38 per cent. Whereas other investors in EasyJet have diversified portfolios, 
EasyJet is Sir Stelios's most successful business asset. Anxious to protect it, he believes the airline should throttle 
back on expansion the better to weather the downturn.
Ryanair has no such problems - or doubts. It is expanding fast, bolstered by a cost-cutting culture that has been 
called so extravagant that no expense, literally, is spared. Compare that higher risk, but high reward, strategy to its 
two biggest competitors, and it's hard to avoid the impression EasyJet has lost its bottle, while Aer Lingus has lost 
its way.

Aer Lingus, the Irish airline that has been under hostile takeover pressure from Ryan-air for more than two years, is 
considering whether to seek a protective alliance with another leading European carrier.
The group announced yesterday that Dermot Mannion, its chief executive, had resigned with immediate effect. Mr 
Mannion said his decision to step down would "allow a new CEO to bring fresh thinking and new ideas to the 
business".
The board is consulting with Goldman Sachs, its financial adviser, on strategic options. These could include the 
opening of alliance talks with one or all of Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways.
The big three carriers are all involved in other merger deals in the wave of consolidation in European aviation.
Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus since October, said the board would consider both internal and external 
candidates to replace Mr Mannion.
Mr Barrington said he was taking over executive responsibility until a successor could be found.
Niall Ferguson, assistant chief executive, and Sean Coyle, chief financial officer, are leading internal candidates to 
succeed Mr Mannion, while there was also speculation yesterday among analysts about the prospects of Brian 
Dunne and Seamus Kearney, former executives in an earlier Aer Lingus management team led by Willie Walsh, 
now chief executive of BA.
The Aer Lingus share price has lost two-thirds of its value in the past year. Yesterday it rose 3.5 cents to 70 cents.
Mr Mannion joined the then state-owned carrier four years ago and has led it through one of the most turbulent 
periods in its history.
It was finally floated by Dublin in September 2006 after government hesitation undermined several previous 
privatisation efforts.
Aer Lingus considers alliance
Mr Mannion fought off two hostile takeover bids from Ryanair in two years with support from the Irish government, 
which still holds a 25.1 per cent stake, but the resistance has come at a heavy price to investors.
Ryanair, which has taken big losses on its investment in Aer Lingus, still holds a stake of 29.8 per cent.
It has kept up a sustained attack and has sought to undermine the credibility of the Aer Lingus management and its 
insistence on maintaining the group's independence, as the share price has slumped.
Ryanair's second all-cash hostile bid launched last December was pitched at EUR1.40 a share, half the EUR2.80 
offered in its original bid in October 2006, which valued the company at EUR1.48bn. Since the failure of the second 
bid the share price has virtually halved again.
The first Ryanair takeover offer was blocked by the European competition authorities. The Irish government also 
opposed the second bid for competition reasons and said this year it remained in favour of Ireland maintaining two 
leading carriers.
Mr Mannion's position has been undermined by Aer Lingus's deteriorating financial performance and its gloomy 
forecasts for 2009.
Investors also became concerned, when details emerged during the takeover battle earlier this year of a 
confidential and favourable pay-off deal for Mr Mannion and some other executives in the event of a hostile take-
over succeeding and the executives deciding to leave. The deal was later rescinded.

CEO of Ireland 's Aer Lingus airline resigns
CEO of Ireland's Aer Lingus airline resigns

Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion resigned Monday, saying the Irish airline needs a new leader to 
compete with its bitter rival Ryanair and return to profit.
Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington has taken charge temporarily while the Dublin-based airline seeks a long-
term successor. Two likely candidates are deputy chief executive Niall Walsh and chief financial officer Sean Coyle, 
a former executive at Ryanair.
Under Mannion's 3 1/2-year leadership, the formerly state-owned Aer Lingus became a publicly traded company, 
resisted two Ryanair takeover bids, and battled labor unions as it slashed its own operating costs.
But Mannion leaves at a time when Aer Lingus is hemorrhaging cash and appears to be losing its toe-to-toe fight on 
European routes with the continent's No. 1 budget carrier, Dublin-based Ryanair. Aer Lingus surprised analysts last 
month by dropping its previous forecasts of a return to profit in 2009, citing the sharper-than-expected bite of 
Ireland's recession, while Ryanair has raised its own already rosier outlook.
"My decision to step down will allow a new CEO to bring fresh thinking and new ideas to the business," Mannion 
said, adding that he had been privileged "to have led the company through a period of profound change."
Aer Lingus shares jumped 7.5 percent to €0.72 ($0.96) on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Aer Lingus floated on the British and Irish stock markets in September 2006, barely a year after Mannion took 
control, at a then-conservative price of €2.20 per share. Mannion launched ambitious plans to use the hundreds of 
millions in cash generated from that privatization to prune Aer Lingus' union-controlled work force and buy new 
Airbus aircraft, which it used to expand both its short-haul European network and its trans-Atlantic routes.
But life as a private company has meant constant conflict with Aer Lingus' neighbor, Ryanair, which stunned 
Mannion and other Aer Lingus executives by immediately building a major stake.
CEO of Ireland 's Aer Lingus airline resigns
While Ryanair has become the biggest Aer Lingus shareholder with a 30 percent holding, its ambitions have been 
thwarted chiefly because the other two major investors the Irish government with 25 percent and Aer Lingus 
employee-controlled trusts with 15 percent more oppose Ryanair.
But Aer Lingus in many ways has had to ape Ryanair's no-frills model to compete. While it still offers a more 
comfortable service by providing passengers seat assignments and luggage transfers, for example Aer Lingus has 
adopted Ryanair's policies of charging extra for myriad items, including checked luggage, and bulldozed its 
frequent-flyer benefits.
Mannion infuriated the Irish government with a January 2008 decision to withdraw Aer Lingus services from 
Shannon, the major airport in western Ireland, in favor of a new hub in the British territory of Northern Ireland. 
Mannion said Belfast would be more profitable, but those predictions have failed to pan out. Aer Lingus restored 
some Shannon services after a 14-month break.

Non-executive directors sometimes get a hard time. The negative perception of their role can best be summed up in 
the old joke. What is the difference between a non-executive director and a shopping trolley? A shopping trolley has 
a mind of its own, but you can get more food and drink into a non-executive director.
Its a bit of an old chestnut and doesn't really reflect the reality of what is required to do the job. But the fallout from 
the salary caps being placed on bank chief executives is likely to trickle down to all non-executive directors in all 
companies.
The state's oversight committee recommended that non-executive directors on bank boards should have their fees 
cut by 25 per cent.
Taking that kind of reduction in non-executive pay on board, banks will set the bar that much lower throughout the 
community of stock market listed companies. The banks tended to be the Rolls Royce of non-executive 
appointments and very much set the levels for which people were rewarded on other boards. There is also 
considerable flexibility about how much non-executives end up earning from their positions. A survey of some of the 
country's biggest plcs shows that non-executive directors sometimes earn a lot more than just directors' fees, but 
are paid additional sums for serving on committees and specific projects.
It seems that prior to the 25 per cent cut, the typical rate for a non-executive director on the board of a bank was  
70,000 at AIB and  100,000 at Bank of Ireland. Over at Irish Life & Permanent it was  68,000. At AIB non-executives 
earned between  70,000 and  475,000 for AIB chairman Dermot Gleeson in 2007. Bank of Ireland chairman Richard 
Burrows earned  512,000 in 2007 at Bank of Ireland.
Lower non-executive pay for directors of banks is already beginning to filter through to other companies. Insurance 
group FBD, chaired by Michael Berkery, has introduced cuts for its directors, both fulltime and part-time.
A cut in bank board directors' fees would make serving on a bank much more unattractive if directorships in other 
companies remained high. Similarly, the cap on bank chief executive pay is causing a knock-on effect for bank 
Bank board pay cuts will trickle down to other Irish companies
senior management, below the chief executive. It is also likely to hit their total pension payouts, where they are 
linked to salary.
Bank of Ireland paid its non executive directors the highest of any plc on the Irish Stock Exchange. Some highly 
successful companies tended to pay a lot less than the banks. A non-executive at Ryanair gets around  32,000 per 
year, or one third what a Bank of Ireland director would have received. Kerry Group paid  52,000, or around half 
that of the Bank of Ireland.
The other trend beginning to emerge is towards smaller boards. Independent News & Media and Waterford 
Wedgwood had some of the largest number of directors on their boards until relatively recently.
At one point Waterford Wedgwood had 23 directors and INM had 21. As recently as the beginning of December 
2008 INM had 19 directors. By this summer it will have 10.
Therefore it is all the more surprising that discussions about the make-up of the board of Irish Nationwide Building 
Society will see its board size grow from eight to ten. Among the Irish quoted companies with the biggest boards 
are Glanbia with 21, Elan with 15 directors, Kerry Group with 18, AIB with 17 and Bank of Ireland with 15. Bigger 
boards don't necessarily mean they are more expensive.
Food groups like Kerry and Glanbia have large co-op shareholders and a tradition of a significant board 
representation from the co-op. Glanbia, despite having 21 on its board, of which 18 were non-executive, paid just  
19,000 in standard directors' fees. Its total non-executive director bill came to  621,000 while Kerry's was  
897,000.Bankof Ireland's non-executive pay bill was  1.5 million, the exact same as at AIB, where there are 17 
directors.
Lower non-executive pay on bank boards will not be the only driving force pushing directors' fees downwards at 
other companies. Poorer financial performance due to the economic slowdown may well play its part. Salaries and 
bonuses are often higher in good times, but non-executive directors' fees should be consistent. However, as 
corporate profits in Ireland grew over the last number of years, so too did non-executive directors' pay.
The companies themselves link this to greater regulation, international expansion and bigger responsibilities and 
say these all meant that directors had to be paid more. We are now entering an era when non executive directors 
will have to do a lot more work, particularly in financial services, and will ultimately be paid a lot less.
But the same is t rue throughout the economy. The problems that arose at Anglo Irish Bank were not helped by the 
fact that there were so many cross-directorships.
Even if non-executive directors did not know what was going on, there is a perception that they should have. The 
government's paranoia about Ireland's international reputation has also involved its battle to fight back the image of 
crony capitalism.

Dermot Mannion is preparing to leave his position as chief executive of Aer Lingus. The move is expected to be 
announced shortly by the airline, which will also indicate that it is to begin an immediate search for his replacement.
Mannion took up the position in August 2005, joining Aer Lingus from Middle Eastern airline Emirates.
Sources say that the parting is ''amicable''. Mannion initially charted a course for expansion but Aer Lingus has 
been hit hard by the recession and by intense competition on many of its routes.
Recent results showed an operating loss of  17.6 million last year, with the company warning that this could rise to 
more than  50million this year, if fares continue to be driven down by the recession.
The company's share price has suffered as a result, closing last Friday at 67 cent and investors are believed to 
have been critical of the company's performance.
During his tenure, Mannion was forced to fight off two bids from rival carrier Ryanair. He also faced controversy 
when it emerged that the former Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman had agreed a change to Mannion's 
employment contract before Sharman left the company.
The change would have yielded a  2.8 million payout to Mannion, in the event of his departure following a 
successful bid for the airline. The change was subsequently rescinded.
Mannion also controversially scrapped Aer Lingus flights from Shannon to Heathrow in favour of a Belfast to 
London service. The service was subsequently partially reinstated.

It's good to see that the rip off mentality is still alive and well in Ireland. A couple of weeks ago, one, two and three-
day trips for the Italy v Ireland game in Bari last Wednesday were selling through various travel agents for anything 
up to  800. Ryanair put on a special one-off direct flight from Dublin to Bari for  400 - a trip that usually costs about  
120 through Stansted.
Hotels in the city put their prices up. About the only part of the trip that didn't seem like a rip-off was the amazingly 
cheap  10 that the Italian FA was charging for the match tickets.
However, after last Saturday night's disappointing performance and result against Bulgaria in Croke Park, suddenly 
the prices of the trips started dropping. By last Monday, some trips were even being offered for  99. Many people 
who hadn't booked originally took up some of these offers, greatly boosting the Irish numbers in the San Nicola 
stadium.
But why are travel agents allowed to get away with charging extortionate prices for sports events in the first place? 
A breakdown of the cost of almost any sports trips offered by travel companies will show that the profits they are 
making on these trips are huge.
Many are almost blatantly touting tickets: a trip that costs  300 without a match ticket can cost  400 or  500 including 
a ticket, which usually has a face value of about  50. The more in demand and the more elusive the tickets are, the 
higher the prices they charge.
Tickets for events such as semi-finals and finals can cost three or four times that of other games, because the travel 
agents know that people will pay the money for a guaranteed match ticket. Fans travelling to the recent Six Nations 
game against Wales in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium were paying up to  700 for a 40minute flight, a below average 
hotel for a night and the match ticket.
THE PITCH
I imagine, however, that what happened last week is just the start of a drop in such prices. People can no longer 
afford these extortionate prices and need to know they're now at least getting value for money. Those offering 
reasonably priced trips will definitely see an increase in business.
For those who did make the Bari trip, they certainly got their money's worth, whatever they paid for it. After the 
result against Bulgaria, the Irish team knew they would have to perform much better.
Despite going a goal down in Bari, the Irish refused to give up and fought to the very end for a much deserved 
equaliser.
Whatever problems people have with Giovanni Trapattoni's management of the Irish team since he took over, they 
cannot say that he hasn't reignited their fighting spirit. They proved this against Georgia earlier in the campaign 
and, while it may have been lacking in Croke Park last Saturday, it was certainly alive and well in Bari.
In fact, had Robbie Keane scored with a good chance right at the end, no travel agent in the country could have put 
a price on that goal.

Norris calls for subordinate bank debt to be converted to equity

Governments looking to resuscitate the banking system ought to force through the conversion of significant portion 
of subordinate debt into equity at ailing banks, according to Barry Norris of Argonout Capital Partners.
Norris, manages the £197 million Argonaut European Alpha and the newly launched Argonaut Absolute Return 
funds at Argonaut. He believes the banking sector has reached a point where a debt for equity swap is the only way 
to effectively decrease the leverage within ailing banks.
He said: 'The only way to recapitalise banks is to force banks to convert its [tier 1 and tier 2] debt into equity. This 
crisis will only be solved after the banks have been recapitalised.'
Norris said subordinated debt market is actually a little bit bigger than the market capitalisation of the European 
banks and a debt for equity swap would go a long way to aiding the banks in the long term.'There is no reason why 
tax payers should be bailing out people that bought bank bonds. But if you forced a debt for equity swap for all of 
that subordinated debt, you would theoretically half the leverage ratio from 40x to 20x.'
Norris did add however, that senior debt and deposit shareholders should not lose any money as a result.
Norris said more rights issues at the struggling banks are out of the question and shareholders who have seen their 
value diluted should not hold out hope for recouping their money. 'If you are an equity shareholder in banks you 
should just post the keys through the letter box. There is so little equity value there is also no appetite for rights 
issues,' he said.
Looking ahead, Norris is positioning his funds in a defensive mode in expectation of a long and protracted 
downturn. He has taken little comfort from the recent market rally in the markets. 'I expect the stocks to hit new 
lows. There is going to be a lot more bad news over the coming months. Profit estimates in most areas of the 
market are too high. A lot of companies will have to raise equities to improve balance sheets.'
However, Norris is finding some opportunities in cyclical firms which have suffered in the downturn but remain well 
positioned to take advantage in a turn in market conditions.
He said: 'RyanAir, for example, had margins of 23% in the past few years but that has fallen to 2% in 2009. But if 
RyanAir is making a 2% margin everybody else in the industry is probably down -20% to -30%. They are even 
unhedged against the fuel price which is a huge benefit.'
Norris calls for subordinate bank debt to be converted to equity
But he is less optimistic about the industrial sector where he has been shorting industrial stocks for his Absolute 
Return fund.
He said: 'Industrials over the last six years have had an incredible run and everything has been in their favour. 
Analysts are still forecasting above average earnings in the sector but there are going to be drastic downward 
earnings. Most of the companies are in for a pretty torrid few years.'
Over the past three years Norris outperformed the benchmark after returning -14.9% while the FTSE Europe ex UK 
TR GBP index fell -22.2%.

The Dublin market rose sharply again today as G20 leaders prepared to boost the International Monetary Fund's 
finances and more signs appeared that the world economy could be recovering.
By 12:30, the ISQE was up 59.75 points to 2,345.52.
G20 leaders looked set to triple the war chest of the International Monetary Fund to fight the economic crisis, 
according to sources at the summit. They said said the latest draft summit communique provided for a USD500 
billion boost to the IMF's resources, raising to USD750 billion the funds it can make available to countries worst hit 
by the global crisis.
The European Central Bank is also set to cut interest rates in another move to stimulate growth. The FTSEurofirst 
300 index of top European shares was up 3.2 percent, on track for its third straight day of gains, helped by better-
than-feared U.S. home sales and factory data and, across Europe, the CAC in Paris rose 4.2pc to 2,958 and the 
DAX in Frankfurt gained almost 5pc to 4,328. In an unprecedented move, the country's three largest stockbrokers, 
Davy, Goodbody and NCB, have pooled their economists in a call for action to restore the economy. The analysts 
broke down the challenges facing Ireland into four distinct areas: the public finances, the economy, the sovereign 
debt markets and the banking system. On the banks, they say that the State will have to invest more to ensure the 
normal functioning of the financial system. They said the six Irish financial institutions face losses of E25 billion due 
to the collapse in the property market. The ISEQ index of Irish shares broke its historic seven-month losing streak in

The Dublin market rose sharply again today as G20 leaders prepared to boost the International Monetary Fund's 
finances and more signs appeared that the world economy could be recovering.
By 12:30, the ISQE was up 59.75 points to 2,345.52.
G20 leaders looked set to triple the war chest of the International Monetary Fund to fight the economic crisis, 
according to sources at the summit. They said said the latest draft summit communique provided for a USD500 
billion boost to the IMF's resources, raising to USD750 billion the funds it can make available to countries worst hit 
by the global crisis.
The European Central Bank is also set to cut interest rates in another move to stimulate growth. The FTSEurofirst 
300 index of top European shares was up 3.2 percent, on track for its third straight day of gains, helped by better-
than-feared U.S. home sales and factory data and, across Europe, the CAC in Paris rose 4.2pc to 2,958 and the 
DAX in Frankfurt gained almost 5pc to 4,328. In an unprecedented move, the country's three largest stockbrokers, 
Davy, Goodbody and NCB, have pooled their economists in a call for action to restore the economy. The analysts 
broke down the challenges facing Ireland into four distinct areas: the public finances, the economy, the sovereign 
debt markets and the banking system. On the banks, they say that the State will have to invest more to ensure the 
normal functioning of the financial system. They said the six Irish financial institutions face losses of E25 billion due 
to the collapse in the property market. The ISEQ index of Irish shares broke its historic seven-month losing streak in 
March with the first gain since the world crisis began in August 2008. The index was 5.8pc higher at the end of the

Highlight: Chairman Colm Barrington takes over temporarily as Dermot Mannion leaves the Irish carrier after four 
years.
Body
Dermot Mannion is to step down as CEO of Aer Lingus with immediate effect. Colm Barrington, who was appointed 
chairman of the board in August 2008, will be acting executive until a new CEO has been appointed.
In an email to friends and colleagues Mannion wrote: "I have decided to step down as chief executive of Aer Lingus 
after almost four very challenging and interesting years."
Mannion was appointed CEO of Aer Lingus in 2005 after serving as finance director and president of group support 
services at Emirates between 1995 and 2005.
Under Mannion's leadership, Aer Lingus completed an initial public offering in 2006.
in 2008 the carrier reported a (EURO)22 million loss for the first half of the year and launched a cost saving plan in 
October.
Soon after Ryanair launched a second takeover bid for the carrier, having been blocked before in a 2006 bid by the 
European Commission on competition grounds. The (EURO)748 million bid was rejected by the Aer Lingus board 
and withdrawn in January 2009.
In March the carrier announced a net loss of (EURO)107.8 million for 2008, compared to a profit of (EURO)105.3 
million in 2007.
"It has been a privilege to serve as Aer Lingus CEO for the past four years and to have led the company through a 
period of profound change," said Mannion in a statement.

the index climbed 64.60 points to 2,193.95.
Global ratings agency, Standard and Poor's were too hasty with their downgrade of Ireland's sovereign debt to AA+ 
from AAA, according to Davy's economist, Rossa White.
S and P also maintained its negative outlook, meaning that a further downgrade is possible. It justified the decision 
on the basis that the fiscal consolidation does not yet go far enough and that a "credible multi-year fiscal plan will 
not emerge until after the next general election in 2012". It also sees Ireland materially under-performing the euro 
area over the next five years. "On both counts, we believe S and P is too pessimistic because of the Budget next 
week and the flexibility demonstrated by the labour market so far," said Mr White. Shares in AIB gained by 5c to 
E0.60, Bank of Ireland rose by 7c to E0.52 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 10c to E1.10. Shares were up 
across Europe. Britain's top share index was up 3pc by midday as miners and energy stocks gained on recovering 
commodity prices and banks rebounded, while a trading update from Marks and Spencer boosted retailers. The 
FTSE 100 was up 113.15 points at 3,876.06, having slid 3.5 percent, or 135.94 points, in the previous session. US 
stocks rose at the open on Tuesday as positive developments in European financials helped bank shares and 
investors shrugged off a drop in home prices as having already been priced in to the markets. The Dow Jones 
industrial average rose 75.90 points, or 1.01 percent, to 7,597.92. The Standard and Poor's 500 Index gained 8.36

will aim to balance the management of Elan's debt overhang with the value in the pipeline," said Davy Research. Oil 
prices crashed through the USD50 a barrel floor yesterday and stood at just over USD49 a barrel today. Shares in 
Aer Lingus nevertheless fell by 2c to E0.58 while Ryanair gained 10c to E2.90. Both the US House and Senate are 
set to discuss their respective budget proposals this week. As noted last week both the House and Senate Budget 
Committees approved versions that will allow for small annual incremental increases in transportation investment 
over the period 2010 to 2014.Shares in CRH rose by 27c to E16.22. According to inflation data from the CSO, 
home insurance premiums had risen 5pc between December and February and 16.5pc year on year, so it would 
appear most insurers are moving their prices up, given the relatively lower dispersion. Home insurance accounts for 
around 14pc of FBD's gross premiums. FBD shares rose by 1c to E6.01.

Global ratings agency, Standard and Poor's were too hasty with their downgrade of Ireland's sovereign debt to AA+

S and P also maintained its negative outlook, meaning that a further downgrade is possible. It justified the decision

My company, OnAir, and other aircraft communication service providers, are enabling passengers to use their own 
mobile devices during flight.
People all over the world are travelling more - and the desire to stay in touch while on the move is growing.
Everywhere you see people in transit they are using mobile phones and BlackBerrys - from waiting rooms, cars, 
trains, buses and airports.
Until very recently, the one exception was on board aircraft. But after extensive development, testing and 
certification, this is changing as an increasing number of airlines launch inflight passenger communications 
services.
Now BlackBerry-type devices or a laptop fitted with a GSM data card can send and receive e-mails and text 
messages, access the internet and make and receive voice calls directly from onboard aircraft while in the air.
For users of the service, charges will appear on their normal mobile phone bill at rates set by their operator, which 
are similar to overseas roaming charges.
If you have not had an opportunity to use these services, you are not alone, as the industry is only just taking off.
A growing number of commercial airlines on every continent either currently offer inflight communications services 
or plan to offer them soon. These include Air Asia, Airblue, British Airways, bmi, Jazeera Airways, Kingfisher, Oman 
Air, Royal Jordanian, Ryanair, Shenzhen Airlines, TAM, TAP and Wataniya Airways.
British Airways recently announced plans to launch services beginning autumn 2009 on its new twice-daily, all-
business-class route from London City Airport to New York City's JFK Airport.
Airborne phones break the sound barrier
There are 12 other commercial airlines and private jet operators with aircraft equipped to launch mobile services in 
coming months.
Although concern has been expressed by some about the possibility of increased noise in the cabin caused by 
phone conversation, our experience in deploying the service has been overwhelmingly positive, with 80 per cent of 
passengers who have used the service wishing to see it deployed on the airline's entire fleet.
Importantly, airlines can choose to offer inflight communications services whenever, however and wherever they 
want.
For example, the Mobile OnAir service comes with a special control panel that enables the crew to allow data 
transfer and SMS only at certain times. It is therefore very easy to create a "quiet time" on the night portion of an 
overseas flight when most passengers are sleeping.
According to a 2008 survey sponsored by Airline Business and Sita, an air travel communications specialist, 42 to 
44 per cent of European airlines plan to offer some form of onboard mobile telephony within the next one to two 
years.
You may think that the global financial crisis would slow the adoption of inflight communications services. Not so. If 
anything, it is increasing the desire among both airlines and passengers to have these services onboard. Why? 
With recent volatility and the sheer pace with which major market changes have occurred, passengers feel a 
stronger need than ever to stay in touch.
For business travellers in particular, timely decisions and communications concerning high priority projects are 
critical.
Inflight communications enable them to work in real time, connect with colleagues, and to participate in business 
decisions while they fly.
For the airlines, inflight passenger communications offer an opportunity to enhance the travel experience.
Not only do these services help airlines differentiate themselves from competitors, they can also provide much-
needed ancillary revenue.
With Mobile OnAir, for example, airlines receive a share of the communications revenue generated on the flight.
They can also use the technology to create their own inflight customer relationship management programme to 
increase loyalty and satisfaction among their premium customers.
Imagine, for example, receiving information on gate changes, connecting flights and lost luggage directly on your 
mobile phone while you are still in the air.
There is no doubt that inflight communications are transforming the air travel experience. Not only does it create a 
new way for us to stay in touch, it also brings a whole new meaning to "working on the plane".
Whether it's making time-critical business decisions in turbulent markets, calling home to say good night to our 
families, or managing travel arrangements on the move, inflight communications offer new benefits and new 
possibilities to all who travel by air. Benoit Debains is chief executive of OnAir

No-frills airline, Ryanair, launched three new Italian bases, bringing its total in Italy to seven.
The new bases are at Alghero, Bologna and Cagliari Airports offering a total of 67 domestic and international 
routes, generating over four million passengers a year and supporting 4,000 jobs in Italy, the airline said.
Ryanair will base two aircraft at each of these three airports bringing Ryanair's total investment in Italy to 26 aircraft 
worth almost USD2 billion.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair and Italy today join in the celebration of continued low fares growth 
across Italy. Our three new bases in Alghero, Bologna and Cagliari will see over 4 million new passengers pass 
through these 3 airports over the next year on 67 low cost domestic and international routes. Ryanair's continued 
expansion in Italy during a time of economic recession shows the benefit of competition and low fares in Italy. 
Ryanair will carry over 17 million passengers to/from Italy this year and will sustain 17,000 jobs throughout the 
regions. Passengers can continue to beat the recession by choosing Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel 
surcharges over Alitalia's high fare, strike ridden services."

Air fares to fall despite economic downturn

Irish travellers can expect lower airline fares and new short haul routes this year, despite the pressure on airlines in 
the economic downturn.
Aer Lingus fares are likely to fall by between 10 per cent and 16 percent on short-haul routes, while Ryanair is 
considering opening a new base in Italy, according to Stephen Furlong, an aviation analyst with Davy Stockbrokers. 
The broker held an 'international aviation day' in Dublin last Thursday, which included briefings from airlines, aircraft 
manufacturers and financiers as well as airport and tour operators.
Furlong said that while the environment was tough for manufacturers and long-haul airlines, the tour operators and 
low-cost airlines ''continue to report robust trade''.
Ryanair is predicting ''massive cost declines'' this year, with an expected saving of  500 million on its fuel bill alone. 
It also expects lower general operating costs.
Profits should be in the range of  50 million to  80 million for the year, Furlong said. Ryanair is also moving to hedge 
up to 90 per cent of its full-year fuel bill at the current low prices by June, ''as it seeks to lock in profitability'', he said.
The airline expects to order between 150 and 200 planes for delivery from 2012-2017. However, after recent cuts to 
some routes, the days of Ryanair flights to obscure destinations could be over.
''Ryanair expects all its growth between now and 2012 to come from the five largest European economies," said 
Furlong.
The European destinations are also a focus for Aer Lingus, which has a new strategy of diversifying outside Ireland 
by setting up bases in Britain. Furlong said it was also entering partnerships on long-haul routes, rather than going it 
alone.
Air fares to fall despite economic downturn
''The long-haul business is facing the most significant restructuring challenges as it has been losing money for two 
years," said Furlong. ''Significant long-haul growth is not possible given the size of the Irish market and the 
company's existing network. The focus on long-haul will be to develop partnerships to drive some growth."
With fares predicted to fall by up to 16 per cent, Furlong said that Aer Lingus could still be profitable ''at any level up 
to a decline of 12 per cent''.
That is because of cost savings from staff and maintenance deals struck by the airline last year. The airline told 
Davy that staff costs per passenger were expected to fall by 15 per cent this year.
However, Furlong said that Aer Lingus may delay the delivery of wide-body aircraft that are due in 2010 and 2011 
''in an effort to protect cash and working capital''. It is not alone in that strategy: aircraft funder RBS Aviation Capital, 
in its presentation to Davy, said that 20 per cent of new aircraft orders could be deferred or cancelled.

Government ministers constantly plead that Ireland is not the only country experiencing a financial crisis, and that 
our problems are only part of a global trend. They're right of course, but only half right.
Ireland is part of a global economy in crisis, but we are faced with the prospect of national bankruptcy because our 
politicians have been unable to control our public finances.
Perhaps, the public were not willing to sanction the measures that were required. That may explain - but it does not 
excuse - the failures of leadership that have so far characterised the administration of Brian Cowen.
At present, the cabinet is engaged in a series of lengthy meetings, in which it intends to formulate the budget to be 
presented on April 7.Thisweekend, another set of meetings will begin with leaders of the trade unions.
Despite our scepticism that useful developments will be achieved either in the cabinet meetings - which are still 
dominated by ministers trying to protect their budgets - or the social partnership sessions, we would like to see a 
third set of meetings.
The Taoiseach and Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Finance, should convene a group of high-achieving Irish 
business people who could advise them on the future of the global economy, and how Ireland could best prepare 
and position itself.
They could advise on the measures necessary to deal with the banking crisis. People like the former commissioner 
Peter Sutherland; Niall Fitzgerald, formerly of Unilever and now of Reuters; Ryanair's Michael O'Leary; and some of 
the leading Irish-American business figures; readers might like to suggest others.
It's well past time to harness the talents that have brought Irish people success on the world stage. Their 
contributions might be as helpful as the trade union leaders crowding into Government Buildings this weekend.
State should listen to business leaders
The government doesn't have to do what they say, but listening to them over breakfast once a month wouldn't do 
any harm.

John O'Shea is joint managing director of Carlow-based accounting firm Lalor O'Shea. The company was formed in 
2003 following the merger of local firms Padraic Lalor & Co, Nicholson & Co and John O'Shea & Co, of which 
O'Shea was managing partner for nine years prior to the merger.
Lalor O'Shea employs 30 staff and has an annual turnover of more than  2million. It offers accountancy, taxation, 
audit and payroll services.
In 2006, it launched the online platform Teamwork.ie to provide real-time services to clients over the internet. The 
company will open a new office in Ballsbridge, Dublin next month, where it expects to create up to five jobs over 18 
months.
What are the main responsibilities of your job?
I am joint managing partner with overall responsibility for audit and accounting services within Lalor O'Shea.
I am also heavily involved in the firm's marketing strategies, particularly in relation to the expansion of our online 
accounting service, Teamwork.ie.
What are your primary professional motivators?
My main motivator is to continuously challenge our work methods, taking advantage of new technologies and 
delivering more efficient, cost-effective accounting services. Through this process, I believe we can pass on 
significant cost-saving opportunities to our clients, while maintaining the highest possible professional standards.
How would you describe your work style?
Flexible, approachable, energetic and open-minded.
What would you rate as the best decision you ever made in business?
Working Week
Without doubt, it was the decision to merge our individual firms in 2003. It allowed us to recruit and retain the very 
best people, and offer a broad range of services not typically found in professional firms outside Dublin.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learned so far?
Expect the unexpected and always be open to learning.
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
I greatly admire Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. While he may not be everyone's cup of tea, his 
company continues to perform ahead of its peers in what is probably the toughest industry in the world. With 
Ryanair, you know what you are getting - efficient service at a competitive cost.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
The next nine months will present many challenges to Irish business. While all companies will be affected and many 
will fail, I believe the spirit of entrepreneurship that prevails in Irish business will help us to come through the 
recession in a much stronger position, so we can benefit from the eventual upturn in the economy.
What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?
Using the trade name Teamwork.ie, we were the first accountancy firm in Ireland to provide an online accounting 
service to our clients.
My vision is to maintain our leading position in the provision of online accounting services to SMEs in Ireland.
The internet has revolutionised the way we conduct our business, allowing us to serve clients throughout the entire 
country. I am excited about the opportunities this will present over the coming years.

Consumers appear to be indulging their inner masochist, according to new research. The results of a survey, 
conducted by an online forum, revealed a preference for cost-saving moves, such as choosing boiled rice over fried 
and cancelling cable services despite the fact they can't afford to go out.
This may also explain the ongoing success of brands such as Ryanair, which offers low fares but charges for 
anything extra. That's the verdict of David Hanley, who runs a company called Focus Groups Online.
''The question for our Chinese takeaway owner might now shift to asking how do I protect my other products from 
suffering similar kinds of masochistic consumer behaviour," Hanley writes. ''The initial temptation would be to take 
away the pain-point by reducing the price of his fried rice. But by doing so, he'll actually disempower his masochistic 
consumers.
''Instead, by actually increasing the price of his fried rice, thereby creating a greater price-gap between the two 
types of rice, he'll reward his masochistic consumers by validating their decision and further empowering them.
They'll be reassured that their scrutiny has been satisfied and be less likely to interrogate other potential savings on 
his menu."
In this climate, according to Hanley, it could actually be Aer Lingus which wins the hearts and minds of the 
masochistic consumer. ''The daily price checking and unrelenting frugality could eventually give rise to sudden and 
occasional bursts of rebellious extravagance," he writes. ''And it is towards the perceived premium service offered 
by Aer Lingus that these weary consumers may be more likely to turn.
''Will knitting, altering clothes, darning socks, growing vegetables, washing our own cars and doing DIY make a 
comeback? Will there be a resurgence of the camping holiday?
''Yes, it's a lot more work and a lot less comfortable, but the pain the masochistic consumer experiences may be 
rewarded and justified by lower price, a sense of community, freedom and a slower pace."

News In Brief
## Some staff at Goodbody Stockbrokers moved to new jobs after the Garda were informed of a scheme used by 
the the country's second largest stockbroker to buy shares in Allied Irish Banks during the early part of the decade, 
the Financial Regulator revealed yesterday. "Ultimately, significant personnel changes took place in Goodbody," 
Financial Regulator chairman Jim Farrell said in a letter to the Joint Oireachtas Committee of Regulatory Affairs. 
"The procedure at the time, in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, was for suspicions 
of money laundering identified by the (Central) Bank to be reported to the gardai. Having reviewed the relevant files 
we can confirm that all reporting obligations were met by the (Central) Bank." - Irish Independent
## KBC Ireland, the Irish subsidiary of Belgian bank KBC, has reported after-tax profits of 103m euro for last year, a 
drop of 25pc from 2007. The bank recorded a 55m euro hit from bad loans, while costs linked to financial marker 
turbulence knocked 35m euro off profits. Chief executive Ted Marah said further 'significant' charges for impaired 
loans could not be ruled out in 2009. - RTE ## Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan has hinted that a tax increase 
may not be applied to cigarettes in the forthcoming budget. He told the Dail that "any further increases in the rate of 
excise on tobacco will have to be considered in the context of the law of diminishing returns that apply to tax 
increases". Mr Lenihan pointed out that Ireland has the highest priced cigarettes in the EU and the highest excise 
on tobacco products. Alcohol as well as tobacco was considerably dearer in the Republic compared to the North, he 
said. - Irish Times ## Bank of Ireland shareholders are to meet today in Dublin to vote on the government's 3.5bn 
euro plan to recapitalise the bank. Yesterday the European Commission approved the capital injection, saying the 
measure had enough safeguards not to distort competition. The recapitalisation would see the government buying 
preference shares in the bank. - RTE ## Operatives yesterday began unplugging the furnace at Waterford Crystal's 
Kilbarry plant, previously described as "the heart of the manufacturing process". It will today be devoid of molten 
glass for the first time in more than 20 years. It is understood that a decision to drain the furnace was taken to save 
Goodbody staff "moved" after garda told Staff Moved
massive energy costs, and efforts will be made in the coming weeks to discover whether the furnace can be 
modified to process reduced quantities of molten glass if manufacturing is resumed - Irish Times ## The pilots' 
group that spent 25m euro on Aer Lingus shares to thwart Ryanair's takeover ambitions is in disarray, after four of 
its seven-man executive quit and members were warned the group was in danger of collapse unless it secured new 
financing this week. The news emerged just ahead of the deadline for members of the Tailwind pilots' group to

News In Brief
## Some staff at Goodbody Stockbrokers moved to new jobs after the Garda were informed of a scheme used by 
the the country's second largest stockbroker to buy shares in Allied Irish Banks during the early part of the decade, 
the Financial Regulator revealed yesterday. "Ultimately, significant personnel changes took place in Goodbody," 
Financial Regulator chairman Jim Farrell said in a letter to the Joint Oireachtas Committee of Regulatory Affairs.

## KBC Ireland, the Irish subsidiary of Belgian bank KBC, has reported after-tax profits of 103m euro for last year, a 
drop of 25pc from 2007. The bank recorded a 55m euro hit from bad loans, while costs linked to financial marker 
turbulence knocked 35m euro off profits. Chief executive Ted Marah said further 'significant' charges for impaired 
loans could not be ruled out in 2009. - RTE ## Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan has hinted that a tax increase 
may not be applied to cigarettes in the forthcoming budget. He told the Dail that "any further increases in the rate of 
excise on tobacco will have to be considered in the context of the law of diminishing returns that apply to tax 
increases". Mr Lenihan pointed out that Ireland has the highest priced cigarettes in the EU and the highest excise 
on tobacco products. Alcohol as well as tobacco was considerably dearer in the Republic compared to the North, he 
said. - Irish Times ## Bank of Ireland shareholders are to meet today in Dublin to vote on the government's 3.5bn 
euro plan to recapitalise the bank. Yesterday the European Commission approved the capital injection, saying the

preference shares in the bank. - RTE ## Operatives yesterday began unplugging the furnace at Waterford Crystal's

Ryanair has called on the Government to ensure that Ireland's main Airport is kept open next Monday for the 
threatened one-day national protest by unions.
Traffic at Dublin Airport has fallen 12pc in the first two months of this year, and is set to fall further.
Ryanair believes that there should be substantial job cuts, pay cuts and productivity increases at Dublin Airport to 
reflect this lower traffic, "but there is no excuse for these public sector strikes".
"Ryanair believes there would be no question of Dublin Airport being closed if Bertie Ahern's Government had 
honoured its 2003 promise to deliver a competing second terminal at Dublin Airport. It is interesting that the UK's 
Competition Commission has recently proposed this competition solution on the UK's BAA airport monopoly, by 
forcing the sale of Gatwick and Stansted airports, and proposing competing terminals be developed at Heathrow," 
the airline said. "Ryanair again calls on the Government to break up the DAA monopoly by selling off Cork and 
Shannon airports and allowing for the development of a competing third terminal at the high cost, inefficient Dublin 
Airport. This would prevent forever any chance of Dublin Airport being closed by Government protected public

NEW YORK 'CANNOT SUPPORT A380' : EMIRATES
capacityEmirates is withdrawing its Airbus A380s from the Dubai-New York Kennedy route to shift the 489-seater to 
Toronto from 1 June, and will deploy the type to Bangkok. The Kennedy flight will revert to a Boeing 777-300ER. 
The airline says the economic downturn has resulted in the need to rethink the positioning and use of the 
superjumbo. Meanwhile, Emirates' Gulf neighbour Etihad Airways is to increase fleet capacity by 18% this year 
through the introduction of 11 new passenger aircraft as it targets a 15% increase in passenger numbers to 7 
million.

Paul Keogh attributes the trend-bucking 4.4 per cent increase achieved by Birmingham International Airport in 2008 
to "the luck of the Irish", writes Jonathan Guthrie . The airport chief executive says: "It was Ryanair coming in 
during July that boosted the traffic."
Ryanair boss Micheal O'Leary had a tempestuous relationship with BIA, whose landing fees he was once fond of 
attacking publicly.
But the two organisations buried the hatchet last year and Ryanair made Birmingham, the second largest UK airport 
outside London by passenger numbers, its 25th base for aircraft. This helped push BIA's passenger numbers to 
9.6m. The airport had punched below its weight because of its now abandoned strategy of giving a cool welcome to 
charter flights and budget airlines. "We were overly loyal to British Airways," Mr Keogh says. "We protected them, 
but when they had the first opportunity to move [their flights] to Heathrow, they did."
Many Midlanders got used to flying from Manchester or the south-east. The challenge for Mr Keogh is to persuade 
them to use BIA, which is owned by local councils and two foreign investment funds.
Nearby Coventry airport has suffered a 48 per cent drop in passenger volumes in the year to February. Wizz Air 
and Thomsonfly stopped passenger services from there last year.

From Mr Matt Andersson.
Sir, Michael O'Leary (Letters, March 20) says high-fare airlines should be told to use their slots or lose them. Lose 
them to whom?
Mr O'Leary makes a fine argument for his particular company but not for the larger industry and consumers.
A great myth about these relatively small niche carriers is that they can merely step into incumbent operations and 
replicate a complex, long-haul network system that depends on certain hub presence, connection service and 
related infrastructure, including broad and flexible airport access.
Moreover, a new entrant or low-cost company may use a slot to link just two regional cities with limited network 
effects; a global network carrier may be collating dozens of connecting international and domestic flights, and often 
on larger capacity aircraft. The disparity in slot use efficiency can be large.
Low-cost carriers have traditionally been most productive when alternative airports are activated as a result of their 
service, thereby relieving hub airports while stimulating new demand in complementary geographic areas.
How global network carriers manage capacity across economic cycles is largely irrelevant to small regional services 
such as Ryanair.
It is a bit like a small ferry service fretting over the operations of a naval armada.

From Mr Steve Mann.
Sir, Can Michael O'Leary (March 20) write his letters with a straight face? I enjoyed his parody of the "high-fare, fuel 
surcharging" airlines that are, in his words, stiffing the consumer, though I'm sure they would prefer the description 
"full service".
When Ryanair first expanded in the UK as a "no-frills" airline, it challenged the traditional full-service carriers and 
cut flight prices dramatically for European consumers. All credit to it, and its sister "no-frills" airlines, for that. But the 
national carriers have responded with cheaper fares (in my opinion, few better than British Airways), so that very 
often there is little difference in price between full service and no frills.
When I book BA, I pretty much know that once I buy the ticket, that's it. I won't pay for "speedy boarding" that is no 
such thing, I won't be charged for checking in, I won't be in a scrum for adjoining seats on board the aircraft, nor will 
I be subject to arbitrary baggage surcharge decisions.
In short, once I have paid, BA will on the whole treat me as a customer, while Ryanair will be trying to pick my 
pocket at every turn, even - it is still a possibility - when I am in the toilet.
The truth is that in today's market, it is Mr O'Leary's airline that stiffs the consumer with its bewildering array of 
added charges at every turn, not the so-called "full service" carriers.
Steve Mann,

Aer Lingus has brought forward its April board meeting to this week to deal with an adverse reaction from 
institutional shareholders on the investor roadshow that followed the publication of its full-year results earlier this 
month.
The airline is to consider scaling back capital expenditure - including deferring aircraft deliveries - in an effort to 
reduce the rate at which it depletes its cash pile, which is forecast to fall from  650 million to approximately  400 
million this year. The cash pile has come under pressure on a number of fronts, including deteriorating trading 
conditions impacting on working capital, capital expenditure commitments and once-off restructuring costs.
A number of institutional shareholders have expressed deep unease with the performance of the Aer Lingus share 
price since the board rejected Ryanair's second takeover attempt, which valued the former state airline at  750 
million, or  1.40 per share. Aer Lingus shares closed last Friday at 59 cent. Market sources told The Sunday 
Business Post that the reaction of some investors to the road shows was ''appalling''.
One source said ''It was cool from some and reasonably angry from others." Aer Lingus corporate affairs director 
Enda Corneille denied this, however, describing meetings with shareholders as ''tough but good''.
Corneille said the current share price undervalued Aer Lingus and that appropriate action would be taken to 
demonstrate to shareholders that management was focused on delivering better returns.
''We're very concerned about the share price, there's no doubt about it," Corneille said. But he added that the share 
price was ''heavily influenced'' by the lack of liquidity in the stock. Only 30 per cent of Aer Lingus shares are 
considered to be available for trading due to the presence of major shareholding blocs, including Ryanair, which 
owns 29 per cent of the company, the government, which controls 25 per cent, and an employee trust, which owns 
almost 15 per cent.
Shareholders force Aer Lingus rethink
Merrion Stockbrokers said last week that recent changes in the airline's guidance for 2009, coupled with the 
deterioration in its cash position, had ''seriously undermined board and management credibility'' and that this was 
''reflected in a lack of confidence in the stock''.
The company needed to consider measures to unlock value, such as using the cash pile to pay a special dividend, 
reassessing capital expenditure or ''possibly, positioning the company so that a fair value could be realised in an 
executable trade sale''. The airline is opposed to using its cash to pay a special dividend.

Travel agents blame government for fall in bookings

Travel agents have sharply criticised the government for creating economic uncertainty, amid a 20 per cent fall in 
holiday bookings compared to last year.
Simon Nugent, chief executive of the Irish Travel Agents Association (ITAA), said agents were frustrated at the 
uncertainty in the economy ahead of the emergency budget next month.
''Consumers are holding off until they see what impact the budget will have on them before they book," said Nugent, 
whose organisation represents 150 travel agents.' 'If the Minister for Finance had wanted to reduce spending, he 
couldn't have done a better job."
He said that bookings for summer holidays were ''down considerably'' on last year, while many tour operators are 
reducing capacity in response to the decline in business.
''There is a sense that cheaper deals will be available at a later date but, with airlines cutting back on certain routes 
and tour operators reducing supply, that may not happen," said Nugent.
Sharon Jordan, product manager at tour operator Sunway, said demand for package holidays had shifted towards 
all-inclusive packages and destinations outside the eurozone.
She said that holiday bookings to the Canary Islands were down on last year, but that there was strong demand for 
destinations such as Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia, which offered a similar standard of accommodation at a lower 
cost than European destinations.
Irish long-haul operators Twohigs Worldwide and Escap 2 said bookings were down by about 20 per cent on last 
year. Colm Flanagan of Twohigs said that customers were increasingly opting for some of the less expensive all 
inclusive options, such as Mexico.
Travel agents blame government for fall in bookings
''It offers incredible value. You can get an all-inclusive package in a five-star hotel for  120 per night. Many are all 
inclusive deals and I think people like to know what the total cost will be beforehand," he said.
Flanagan said bookings to expensive locations, such as the Indian Ocean area, were ''way down'' on last year. 
However, some destinations had reacted quickly to the downturn, with many trips to Dubai at about a third of the 
price they were in 2008, he added.
Airlines have also been reducing capacity on some routes and cancelling others. Ryanair last week said it would 
remove one plane from its fleet at Dublin and cancel four routes and decrease the frequency on eight more at 
Dublin airport. Aer Lingus's passenger traffic fell by 8.4 per cent across its fleet in February compared to February 
2008.

Kevin Spacey stole the show with his Bill Clinton impersonation at the FT ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business 
awards at the Tate Modern, though Lakshmi Mittal enjoyed the limelight with a few gags of his own.
The actor, who drew the steel baron's son Aditya Mittal as a patron for his Old Vic Theatre discounted tickets for 
under-25s, was in Oscar-winning form, with his impromptu American Airlines routine at the expense of the no-show 
of award winner Ryanair.
A light-hearted Mittal senior - who had led the panel of judges for the Boldness awards - earlier told FT editor 
Lionel Barber  that his first bold move was to leave his home in India for Malaysia. He said the second bold move 
was going to Trinidad and Tobago, although he joked that when he departed India "my family did cry. . . but I don't 
know whether that was with sadness or happiness".
He reluctantly admitted to moments of self-doubt when decisions he had made met with resistance, such as the 
takeover by Mittal of Arcelor, as well as when he noted in 1998 that the US steel industry was ripe for consolidation.
Those mingling in the gallery for drinks earlier included departing London Stock Exchange chief Dame Clara Furse  
and husband Richard , and BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons , as well as Mittal advisers such as Goldman 
Sachs' Richard Gnodde  and PwC partner Richard Sykes , who jested with Leo Johnson , co-founder of a 
sustainability finance business PwC recently took over.
Meanwhile, Mr Spacey's financial success at the Old Vic has emboldened him to embark on a mission to California 
after hearing that his old school on the outskirts of Los Angeles cancelled its school play due to lack of funding. Mr 
Spacey will make the economic argument for the arts when he meets Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Lack of political consensus is one of the biggest hurdles facing the industry, writes Kevin Done
Body
UK airports are going through the biggest shake-up in their history.
The dismantling of BAA, the world's biggest airports operator, ordered yesterday by the Competition Commission, 
will for the first time put the ownership of the country's leading airports in different, largely private, hands.
But it is still far from clear what the break-up will mean for achieving the government's big goal of an expansion of 
capacity and the building of new runways in the highly congested south-east of England.
Future development of the airport sector is clouded by political uncertainty, with a general election due in little more 
than a year and a lack of consensus between the two leading parties about the wisdom of building new runways.
The Labour government recently gave its approval for BAA's plans to build a third runway at London's Heathrow, 
the country's only hub airport, which has been hampered for years by a shortage of runway capacity.
Operating from just two runways and at around 99 per cent of capacity, its competitiveness has been undermined 
by other European hubs, most importantly Charles de Gaulle in Paris, Frankfurt Airport and Amsterdam's Schiphol, 
which have all built more diverse global networks, helped by more runways and more available capacity.
But the Conservatives have expressed outright opposition to the building of a third runway - ever since a shock 
decision was taken at last autumn's party conference - and have promised to stop the process in its tracks. BAA, 
which will continue to hold on to London's Heathrow airport, the prize asset in its portfolio, regardless of the break-
up, is being urged by the government to bring forward a planning application for a new runway to be operational 
"early in the period between 2015 and 2020". However, a change of power at Westminster would put the issue back 
into the realm of debate.
Competition could help improve the much-derided quality of service at London's airports, but extra capacity will take 
years to complete. Christopher Clarke, chairman of the BAA airports inquiry, said yesterday the sale of London's 
Sector faces long haul to sort out its baggage
Gatwick and Stansted airports, as well as either Edinburgh or Glasgow in Scotland, would "kick-start a process of 
competitive rivalry from a standing start where today there is no competition at all".
But he acknowledged that, while some of the benefits could be expected from the outset, others "such as those 
resulting from competition in delivering new runway capacity at Stansted and Heathrow, may be some years away".
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's director of legal and regulatory affairs, welcomed the Commission's report and said: "The 
BAA monopoly has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient, gold-
plated and overly expensive facilities, encouraged by an ineffectual and incompetent regulator, the Civil Aviation 
Authority." He said competition in the airline industry had delivered huge benefits for consumers and this would be 
replicated at the three main London airports.
Ashley Steel, head of transport and infrastructure at KPMG, said the move to split up BAA "is a harsh decision 
which couldn't come at a worse time for BAA. To complete the sale of three airports within two years as the 
Commission has ordered will be difficult, particularly in the current environment with little or no debt around and with 
air passenger numbers falling. Valuations will be tricky".
Whatever the fate of the individual airports, for the UK competition authorities the BAA case marks a watershed. It 
is the biggest demonstration of the new powers, acquired in the 2002 Enterprise Act, to order far-reaching 
divestitures to remedy competition failings in a particular industry.

From Mr Michael O'Leary.
Sir, The letter from Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary-general of the Association of European (high-fare) Airlines 
(March 16), is typical of the market-distorting, protectionist, anti-consumer claptrap so beloved by his flag carrier 
members.
Mr Schulte-Strathaus represents a group of airlines that are suffering traffic losses as consumers become fed up 
with paying their high fares and unjustified fuel surcharges. If British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France and other high-
fare fuel surchargers can't fill their flights, then the solution is simple: just lower the fares or scrap the fuel 
surcharges. Their solution (unsurprisingly) is to offer fewer flights, keep fares and fuel surcharges high, stiff the 
consumer and then get their friends in the European Commission to protect their unused slots.
Ryanair strongly believes that the current slot system of "use it or lose it" should prevail. We say this with little self-
interest since we wouldn't take a present of a slot at Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle or Frankfurt Main airports. 
Consumers are switching to Ryanair's low-fare, no fuel-surcharge flights from Stansted, Beauvais and Frankfurt 
Hahn. Allowing high-fare airlines simply to sit on airport slots when they are not using them is further protectionism 
that allows those airlines to restrict flights, restrict competition, restrict choice and maximise their high fares and 
surcharges.
The European Commission and national governments should tell these airlines to use their slots or lose them to 
new entrants. This will maximise the number of flights and choice, maximise competition and give consumers a 
better deal than they have been getting from Mr Schulte-Strathaus's high-fare, fuel-surcharging members over the 
past year or two.
Politicians and regulators should follow a simple strategy for promoting the consumer interest: do the exact opposite 
of any policy put forward by Mr Schulte-Strathaus and the Association of European (high-fare, fuel-surcharging) 
Airlines.

Highlight: Eurocamp sees crunch as time to return to UK
Body
Eurocamp, purveyor of sun, sea and sangria holidays under canvas, is to set up "Brit camps" this summer as it 
expects cash-strapped families to rediscover the great British countryside.
Holidaybreak, which owns the Eurocamp, Keycamp and PGL adventure holiday brands, believes the stronger euro 
and people's straitened financial circumstances will force many more holidaymakers to stay at home rather than go 
abroad.
Carl Michel, chief executive, says the nine sites for its "UK Escapes" in the Lake District, Snowdonia, Yorkshire, 
Scotland and the south-west of England should appeal to families on a tight budget. The group is reviving domestic 
holidays 15 years after it abandoned its last three UK campsites for lack of demand.
"We think the UK consumer will be UK-based this year. People are being driven by value and £155 for a weekend 
in the school summer holidays is good value," Mr Michel said.
Eurocamp's six-berth tents will be on sites run by the Forestry Commission or National Trust with facilities such as 
warm showers. They will have the same beds, kitchen and outside barbecue as on the continent. Locations include 
the banks of Loch Lomond, the foot of Mount Snowdon and the New Forest.
In place of the usual high-octane children's entertainers, seven sites have forest rangers to teach animal tracking 
and fire-making skills.
However, the sunshine of a typical French or Italian Eurocamp might be missing. For that reason, while sites are 
available by the week, Mr Michel is targeting the short-break market.
"We should not forget that we have had two wet and windy summers and there is no guarantee the next one won't 
be as well. For their main holiday people will go where they want and where they know the sun will shine. They 
might have one week instead of two," he said.
People would swap long weekends abroad for breaks within driving distance, he predicted.
Hard-up Brits offered chance to carry on camping closer to home
The ex-McKinsey consultant said it was too early to judge if the recession would bring a permanent return to the 
traditional annual holiday. But the era of high demand for cheap flights could be coming to an end.
"What is ludicrously expensive is to fly to some city you don't quite know how to pronounce for the weekend just 
because Ryanair has a flight there. By the time you have paid your taxes, baggage and a hotel it isn't so cheap."

## Ryanair pilots have voted in favour of a 12-month pay freeze with a productivity increase to avoid a proposed 10 
per cent cut in pay, the airline said in statement yesterday. The airline had originally sought a pay cut from pilots in 
response to the economic conditions for the low-fares airline and two consecutive quarters of trading losses at the 
company. The Ryanair pilots successfully negotiated an alternative to the proposals. - Irish Times
## Ireland, Spain and Switzerland have the highest direct exposure to shocks from the global economic crisis 
among the smaller 'AAA' rated countries, and our small size means we have less time to place our finances on a 
sustainable path, bond rating agency Fitch said yesterday. Brian Coulton, head of global economics at Fitch 
Ratings, said that in the current climate, with investors looking for safe assets, smaller borrowers, such as Ireland, 
have less ability to pursue economic policies, and less time to place public finances on a sustainable path, than the 
big 'benchmark' borrowers, such as the US, Britain, France and Germany. "The sheer size of the fiscal revenue 
shock in Ireland and its relatively small government bond market constrain the ability of the Government to take 
counter-cyclical policy measures," Mr Coulton writes in the report. - Irish Independent
## Eamonn Rothwell and the Philip Lynch-led Moonduster consortium are preparing to table a joint bid of up to 15 
euro a share for listed ferry operator Irish Con-tinental Group. This would represent a negligible premium to ICG's 
current share price of about 14.50 euro and is unlikely to be recommended to shareholders by the company's board 
of directors. This would leave the bid dependent on the support of property developer Liam Carroll, who owns 29.24 
per cent of the business and is its biggest shareholder. - Irish Times ## Ireland should not be adversely affected by 
US President Barack Obama's plans to tackle tax avoidance by US companies operating overseas, Taoiseach 
Brian Cowen said yesterday. Speaking following their meeting at the White House, Mr Cowen said the two men had

CRH led a bounce on the Irish share market yesterday, helping it to a resumption of its recent run of gains.
The shares of the building materials giant rose by 92c to 1564 on the back of new figures showing that the price of 
construction supplies is holding up in the US.
The figure is important for the company, which makes around half of its profits stateside.
The price index for the sector showed the price of aggregates - that's stones to you and me - remainng robust in 
February with an increase of 6.3pc year-on-year, and with asphalt soaring by 33pc year-on-year. Analyst Robert 
Eason of Goodbody Stockbrokers pointed out yesterday that CRH is the number three aggregate producer in the 
US and the number one asphalt producer. The leap in CRH's price helped the ISEQ index of Irish shares to a rise 
of 25.22 points for the day to 2,109.93. With shares other than CRH trading unpredictably , the ISEQ had an 
uncertain passage to its higher close. It had begun the day ahead, reflecting a positive mood on world markets 
generally. However, the mood across Europe took a negative turn after the number of people claiming jobless 
benefit in the UK jumped by the biggest amount since records began in 1971. A wider measure of UK 
unemployment rose above 2 million for the first time since 1997. "The unemployment numbers were worse than 
expected and truly horrendous in what they say about the state of the UK economy," said one London analyst. The 
ISEQ went into reverse mode after the figures, along with other European markets. But, while London remained in 
negative territory for the rest of the day, the Dublin market did crawl back into the plus zone before the close. 
Among the shares that helped its recovery was Ryanair, which gained 3 cent to 287. The low cost carrier was 
helped by a report showing that travellers are increasingly looking for bargains. The report from IATA said the 
number of passengers travelling on first or business class fell by 16.7pc in January, a further substantial decline 
from december levels, which were 13.3pc down on the year. IATA said the fall was causing significant damage to 
standard airline yields and profitability. The trade body also reported evidence of passengers trading down from 
ISEQ ends 25 points ahead as CRH jumps ISEQ Up 25
premium to economy seats, particularly in Europe. With such news being music to the ears of non frills carriers, it 
may have been significant that Aer Lingus shares rose yesterday by 1c to 58, suggesting that the market now 
classes it with low cost carriers such as Ryanair. Irish banks had mixed fortunes yesterday, despite finance minister 
Brian Lenihan's efforts earlier this week in London to talk up their solidity. He told market players in London that the 
backing of the European Central Bank was a guarantee of their strength. Bank of Ireland managed a gain of 3c to 
35, but AIB slipped by 3c to 52. Irish Life and Permanent also slipped 3c to 75. Readymix clawed back 1c yesterday 
to a lowly 15, after announcing big losses earlier in the week, and C and C bounced by 5c to 115 after trade figures 
showed the performance of its Magners cider steadying up on the UK market. Bakery group Aryzta slipped by 25c 
to 1675, however, and Kingspan dipped by 20c to 265.

Playing the slots INTRODUCTION: The European Commission's proposal to 
suspend 'use-it-or-lose-it' regulations to help legacy carriers ride out the 
recession is another slap in the face for the single aviation market

Economic downturns as severe as the one now gripping the global economy result in stress and hardship for tens 
of thousands of businesses and millions of their employees. But at least free markets ensure that a small but 
significant minority can thrive on the new opportunities that emerge, as the recession lays bare the weaknesses of 
established players that are incapable of streamlining themselves quickly enough to adapt to the new landscape.
Entrepreneurs are not quite rubbing their hands with glee, but they are talking openly about their excitement as they 
prepare for revolution in the world of business.
Someone forgot to tell the European Commission, it seems. Governments have for years talked about the need to 
provide new-entrants with access to slots at the continent's most congested hubs. Hence the concept of the "use it 
or lose it" slot was born. If an airline can't turn a profit using a particular slot pair, or indeed sustain the losses as it 
tries to hang on to it through a slump in demand, then surely it is in the interests of consumers that it falls into the 
hands of a carrier that can? How can the so-called liberalised single European aviation market function if the weak 
aren't allowed to die?
So, why is the Commission falling over itself to suspend use-it-or-lose-it rules to help high-cost flag carriers hoard 
valuable slots that they cannot profitably use? The Brussels bureaucrats are worried that these airlines will be 
"forced" to operate loss-making services to hold on to slots, when they desperately need to cut capacity. But what is 
even more desperately needed is recognition that there are still too many financially struggling carriers fighting over 
market share at major hubs, and some good will come out of this recession if it forces a round of consolidation.
The Commission's protectionist proposals will do little more than prolong the status quo, as newcomers such as 
EasyJet and Ryanair face continual hurdles in trying to deliver what it seems consumers really want, which is low 
fares. These proposals will lead to fewer flights and higher fares, and worsen the economic crisis for all but a 
handful of ailing flag carriers.
Playing the slots INTRODUCTION: The European Commission's proposal to suspend 'use-it-or-lose-it' 
regulations to help legacy carriers ride out the recession is ....
If unused slots are in demand they will be taken up by other, more efficient airlines, and the interests of the flying 
public and the business community will be best served. The European Parliament and European Union member 
states should finally start practising what they preach and reject the Commission's anti-competitive proposals, 
which belong in the economic dark ages.

From Mr Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus.
Sir, Your editorial "Get down to earth" (March 12) overlooks a fundamental feature of any scheduled transport 
undertaking, be it a national airline, a no-frills carrier, a railway, bus or ferry service - the need to plan in advance. 
British Airways' Summer 2010 timetable - or Ryanair's for that matter - is not a blank sheet of paper. It will be a 
modified version of this year's schedule, which is a modified version of 2007's. This continuity is vital.
Slot allocation rules - which are far less "byzantine" than you claim - are simply a tool to manage inadequate airport 
capacity.
The process you advocate, of doing away with them and replacing them with an auction system, could result in an 
airport having a Washington link this year replaced by a Malaga flight next year, replaced by an Aberdeen service 
the year after. This is in the interest neither of airlines, airports nor consumers. If slots went to the highest bidder, 
regional feeder services would be the first casualty.
The airline industry, as another of your articles on March 11 made clear, is indeed in a crisis, and let us not pretend 
that particular business models within our industry are immune.
Other industrial sectors are asking for huge financial handouts. The airlines are not. They are asking for reasonable 
and rational measures that will ease immediate pressures, such as the temporary mismatch between demand and 
supply.
Before the crisis struck, consumers were extremely well served by a wide range of travel options encompassing 
routes, timings, prices and service features. A slot use waiver would be a practical and pragmatic step - at zero cost 
to the taxpayer - to ensure that this choice will continue to be available once the crisis has receded.

Budget carrier Ryanair said Monday it will move a fifth aircraft away from its Dublin base, blaming Ireland's new 
departure tax for the move.
Ryanair had previously announced that four of the 22 planes based in Dublin would be relocated.
The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, noted that other European countries were reducing costs to 
encourage tourism but that Ireland had raised costs.
Ireland will impose a tax of €10 (€13) on each departing traveler beginning March 30.
