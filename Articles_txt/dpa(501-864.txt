DPA FINANCE aviation EU  EU orders Germany, Belgium to recover aid from low-cost airports Brussels   
The European Union turned up the heat Wednesday on
airports catering to low-cost airlines, ordering Germany and Belgium
to recoup illegal state aid they granted to two airfields.
  
"EU state aid rules allow public authorities to grant support to
airports where it is justified," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin
Almunia said in a statement.
  
"However, duplicating unprofitable airport infrastructure or unduly
favouring certain airlines wastes taxpayers' money and distorts
competition," he added.
  
At issue are the Charleroi airport near the Belgian capital Brussels
and the now-insolvent Zweibruecken airport in Germany, located about
200 kilometres from Frankfurt.
  
Charleroi is used mainly by Ryanair, while Zweibruecken caters to
Germanwings, TUIFly and Ryanair. Insolvency proceedings for the
German airport were opened on Wednesday.
  
Zweibruecken has received support measures amounting to about 47
million euros (59 million dollars) since 2000, according to the
European Commission, the EU's executive.
  
But the aid "unnecessarily duplicated already existing, unprofitable
airport infrastructure in the same region," the commission found,
pointing to the Saarbruecken airport, some 40 kilometers away. The
support gave Zweibruecken an "undue economic advantage," it said.
  
Airlines were also given an undue advantage through agreements
concluded with Zweibruecken, the commission found, saying that
Germanwings has to pay back about 1.2 million euros, while Ryanair
and TUIFly owe around 500,000 and 200,000 euros respectively.

In the case of Charleroi, meanwhile, the airport should pay back 6
million euros, the commission said, saying that competition was
significantly distorted by aid granted since 2002, which helped the
airfield to "develop considerably."
  
The commission has also launched an investigation into Charleroi's
main competitor, the Zaventem airport in Brussels. At issue is a
19-million-euro yearly state support scheme granted to the airfield
for 2014-16.
  
Most of the funds are reportedly going to the national carrier
Brussels Airlines.
  
"The commission has concerns that this measure would lead to public
money being used to fund ordinary operating costs of selected
airlines without furthering any objective of common interest," the EU
institution said.

Frankfurt   
Lufthansa pilots are to go on strike Tuesday for
the fifth time this year amid an ongoing row over retirement
benefits.
  
The pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, announced Monday that the
industrial action will take place at Frankfurt airport, Germany's
largest, from 8 am to 11 pm (0600 to 2100 GMT).
  
Travellers will face fresh disruptions as long-haul flights will be
affected. The union said it was forced to resort to such measures as
talks with the Lufthansa management were deadlocked and it had not
offered a compromise.
  
The group's pilots have already walked off the job four times this
year over Lufthansa's plans to scrap its current retirement benefits

Lufthansa pilots plan walkout as Air France ends two-week strike
By dpa correspondents   =
  
Frankfurt (dpa) - Lufthansa pilots are planning a walkout on Tuesday
for the fifth time this year over retirement benefits, just as pilots
at Air France end a two-week strike over that airline's cost-cutting
plans.
  
Lufthansa pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, said Monday that the
industrial action would take place at Frankfurt airport, Germany's
largest, from 8 am to 11 pm (0600 to 2100 GMT).
  
Travellers will face fresh disruptions as long-haul flights will be
affected. The union said services on Airbus A380, A330, A340 and
Boeing B747 would be hit.
  
It said it was forced to resort to such measures as talks with the
Lufthansa management were deadlocked and it had not offered a
compromise.
  
The group's pilots have already walked off the job four times this
year over Lufthansa's plans to scrap its current retirement benefits
scheme.
  
Those strikes resulted in the cancellation of 4,300 flights and
forced hundreds of thousands of passengers to face lengthy delays or
make alternative transport arrangements.
  
The strike call comes a day after the largest pilots' union at Air
France called off a strike that had lasted two weeks, costing the
airline more than 200 million euros, according to management.
  
The SNPL union said it was ending the walkout out of a "sense of
responsibility," despite failing to reach agreement with the carrier
on the development of its low-cost subsidiary Transavia.
1ST LEAD
  
The pilots had been severely criticized for their perceived
intransigence by the government, media and Air France ground staff.
  
The airline, which was forced to cancel thousands of flights,
welcomed the end of the protest and said the flight schedule would
"gradually return to normal" from Tuesday.
  
The pilots are pushing for a single contract for all Air France
pilots that would also cover those at Transavia, its discount
division which Air France aims to develop into a rival of low-cost
operators such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
  
Air France has rejected their demands, saying it needs to cut costs
to compete in the competitive European leisure travel market.
  
Lufthansa, too, is battling to reduce costs in the face of stiff
competition from budget airlines and new emerging Middle East
carriers, including Abu Dhabi-based Etihad and Dubai-based Emirates.

Prague   
The Czech Republic's largest airline is to lay off a
third of its 900-strong staff, the company said on Wednesday, citing
a drop in demand due to the stand-off between Ukraine and Russia.
  
A spokesman said the lay-offs - which are set to include pilots -
became necessary after passenger numbers from Russia and other former
Soviet republics declined due to the crisis in Ukraine.
  
Union representatives said the restructuring threatened the very
existence of the airline, adding that they were prepared to organize
a strike.
  
Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka also raised concerns over the
plan, and said his predecessors' decision to partly privatize the
company had been a failure.
  
The airline, co-owned by Korean Air, has been shedding assets in an
attempt to reverse the losses resulting from a failed expansion
several years ago.
  
Like many European carriers, it is facing competition from low-budget
airlines including Ryanair and easyJet.

DPA FINANCE France labour transport  Air France makes pilots «final offer» to resolve week-old strike 
Paris   
Air France-KLM CEO Alexandre de Juniac urged striking
French pilots Monday to accept the airline's "final offer" for the
resolution of a week-old industrial dispute that has cost the airline
tens of millions of dollars.
  
Over half of Air France's pilots walked out on September 15 in
protest over the airline's plans for the development of its low-cost
subsidiary, Transavia.
  
At issue is the airline's plans to hire Transavia pilots on local
contracts in southern Europe.
  
After days of deadlocked talks and thousands of cancelled flights Air
France management on Monday proposed to suspend the plan until the
end of the year.
  
Delaying the project would give the airline "time to hold an in-depth
dialogue on the project and to create the necessary guarantees for
the unions" on jobs, de Juniac said.
  
The main pilots union SNPL, which announced Saturday it was extending
the strike until September 26, had yet to respond to the offer.
  
The strike is the longest by Air France pilots since 1998.
  
De Juniac estimated the cost to the airline of cancelling around
two-thirds of its scheduled flights at 15-20 million euros a day.
  
"With what we have lost we could have bought four medium-range
aircraft," he complained, labelling the dispute "disastrous for the
company as it starts to get back on its feet."
  
Air France makes pilots «final offer» to resolve week-old strike
Air France had just begun to rebound after years of heavy losses and
thousands of job cuts.
  
Ground staff, who have borne the brunt of recent restructuring plans,
have expressed frustration with the pilots' reluctance to share in
the sacrifices.
  
With Transavia the airline aims to go up against Ryanair, Easyjet and
other low-cost carriers in the European leisure travel market.
  
De Juniac said the pilots needed to recognize the demands of
competing at the low-cost end of the market, including on wage costs.

Air France pilots reject proposal to resolve week-old strike
By Clare Byrne, dpa   =
  
Paris (dpa) - Striking Air France pilots on Monday rejected a
management proposal aimed at ending an eight-day-old strike that has
grounded thousands of flights and cost the airline tens of millions
of dollars.
  
The pilots dismissed an offer from the carrier in which it would
suspend controversial plans for the development of its low-cost
subsidiary, Transavia. They demanded instead that Air France scrap
the plan entirely.
  
"The conditions are clearly not there for a project of this size to
be implemented calmly," the president of the main SNPL pilots
union, Jean-Louis Barber, told a press conference.
  
At issue is Air France's plans to hire Transavia pilots in southern
Europe on local contracts that are less advantageous than those
enjoyed by pilots at the main carrier.
  
Air France-KLM chief executive Alexandre de Juniac said the airline's
offer to hold over the plan until the end of the year while
negotiations continued was its "final offer."
  
The strike - which began on September 15 for one week but was later
extended until September 26 - is the longest by Air France pilots
since 1998.
  
De Juniac estimated the cost to the airline of cancelling around
two-thirds of its scheduled flights at 15-20 million euros (19-26
million dollars) a day.

DPA POLITICS France labour transport  French government urges Air France pilots to end crippling strike 
Paris   
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called on Air France
pilots Wednesday to end a three-day-old strike which has grounded
scores of flights, costing the airline millions of euros in lost
revenue and reimbursements.
  
"This labour dispute must end. I'm asking Air France pilots to stop
this dispute and sit down at the [negotiating] table and move
forward," the Socialist premier told France Inter radio.
  
Valls said it was "regrettable that a single category, the pilots,
can bring air transport in the country to a halt."
  
The pilots began a week-long strike on Monday to protest the
airline's plans for its low-cost subsidiary, Transavia.
  
The pilots say the company's intention to base Transavia crews around
Europe will lead to job losses in France - claims Air France rejects.
  
Several days of negotiations have failed to end the deadlock.
  
Around 60 per cent of the carrier's pilots have walked off the job,
forcing Air France to cancel a similar proportion of flights.
  
Domestic flights in France appeared to be the worst affected, with as
many as 90 per cent cancelled at some regional airports Wednesday.
  
A spokesperson for the airline told dpa that it was trying to
maintain as many long-haul flights as possible.
  
Air France says the work stoppage is costing it between 10 and 15
million euros (13 and 19 million dollars) a day, excluding
reimbursements for passengers demanding their money back.
French government urges Air France pilots to end crippling strike
  
Ground staff, who have borne the brunt of several rounds of job cuts
in the past two years, have expressed frustration with the pilots.
  
Laurent Berger, leader of Air France's main union for ground staff
CFDT, accused the pilots Tuesday of refusing to share in the efforts
made by other staff towards turning around the loss-making carrier.
  
Air France plans to develop Transavia to make up lost ground in the
European low-budget travel market, which is dominated by carriers
such as Ryanair and Easyjet.

Striking French pilots under fire as 1,800 flights nixed
By Clare Byrne, dpa   =
  
Paris (dpa) - French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called on Air France
pilots Wednesday to end a three-day-old strike which has grounded
1,800 flights so far, costing the airline millions of euros.
  
"This labour dispute must end. I'm asking Air France pilots to stop

The airline says the work stoppage is costing it between 10 and 15

Last year, the group turned an operating profit for the first time in
three years.

DPA FINANCE Europe labour transport  Air France pilots dig in on day two of strike Paris   
A strike by pilots at Air France, which has grounded
more than half of the airline's flights, entered a second day Tuesday
with no sign of a resolution.
  
Air France said it was forced to cancel 60 per cent of its scheduled
flights on Tuesday and Wednesday, up from 48 per cent on Monday, as
six in 10 pilots stayed away in protest at the airline's plans for
the development of its low-cost business.
  
The strike, which is to run through September 22, threatens to be the
most disruptive at Air France since 1998.
  
The pilots say that Air France's plans to develop its low-cost
subsidiary Transavia will lead to job losses in France and force
crews to accept lower pay.
  
Air France sees Transavia as its only hope of muscling back in on the
leisure travel market, where the French carrier is being outdistanced
by low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
  
"It's Transavia or it's decline in Europe," the chief executive of
the Air France-KLM group, Alexandre de Juniac, told RTL radio.
  
In a first concession to the pilots, the airline said it would cap
its expansion of its Transavia fleet at 30 aircraft by 2019, instead
of 37 as originally proposed. At the moment, Transavia has 14.
  
Despite the disruptions, there were no scenes of chaos at French
airports. Most Air France passengers had either chosen to postpone
their travel or booked themselves onto competing carriers.
  
In Germany, meanwhile, a threatened strike Tuesday by Lufthansa
pilots, which could have further complicated air travel in Europe,
Air France pilots dig in on day two of strike
was called off at the last minute.
  
The Cockpit pilots union, which is protesting the airline's plans for
a new early-retirement scheme, said Lufthansa had presented a new
offer that was "worth discussing."
  
The strike would have been the fourth by Lufthansa pilots in three
weeks.

Lufthansa pilots nix Tuesday strike as Air France pilots stay away
By Clare Byrne and Andrew McCathie, dpa   =
  
Frankfurt/Paris (dpa) - German pilots union Cockpit has called off a
strike scheduled for Tuesday due to advances in negotiations with
Lufthansa, the union said late Monday.
  
The surprising development came on the eve of a plan by pilots to
walk off the job for the fourth time in three weeks as part of a
campaign to head off a new early-retirement scheme.
  
The airline sent the pilots a new set of conditions for the plan,
prompting the pilots' bargaining committee to call off Tuesday's
strike and offer dates for new rounds of negotiations.
  
Cockpit spokesman Joerg Handwerg told dpa that Lufthansa had
presented a "modified offer" that was "worth discussing." He said
that it was not clear whether the concession would be enough to
resolve the labour dispute.
  
Pilots at the airline's main Frankfurt hub were to strike for eight
hours starting 9 am (0700 GMT) Tuesday. The airline now expects its
flight schedule will be mostly normal.
  
Last week, Lufthansa was forced to cancel about 140 flights at Munich
Airport because of a strike. That followed industrial action last
month by pilots at Frankfurt Airport and a strike by pilots working
for Lufthansa's budget offshoot, Germanwings.
  
Pilots with Air France meanwhile began a week-long strike, forcing
the airline to cancel nearly half of its flights Monday.
  
Some 60 per cent of Air France pilots walked off the job over
management's proposal to introduce lower wage packages for crews
working at Air France's low-cost subsidiary, Transavia.
3RD LEAD
  
The strike, which is to run through September 22, is shaping up as
the most disruptive at Air France since 1998.
  
At Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, the airline's counters were
swamped by stranded passengers looking to be rebooked on other
flights.
  
Air France, which is compensating passengers for cancelled flights,
estimated the strike would set the company back between 10 and 15
million euros (13 million to 19 million dollars) a day.
  
Both Air France and Lufthansa are trying to cut costs to compete with
Ryanair, Vueling and other budget carriers.
  
Lufthansa wants to scrap a retirement plan under which its 5,400
pilots can retire at 55 and continue to receive part of their wages.
  
Air France wants to hire crews on smaller pay to build up its
low-cost business at Transavia. Air France pilots are demanding a
single contract for all the group's pilots.
  
The strike comes as the Air France-KLM group is starting to turn a
corner after years of heavy losses, which had prompted thousands of
job cuts.
  
Last year, the group turned an operating profit for the first time in
three years. The group aims to achieve net profits by the end of
2015.

that the cost of the strike would range between 10 to 15 million
euros (13 million to 19 million dollars).
  
The pilots' action was triggered by the company's plans to lower
annual costs by more than a billion euros by transferring short- and
medium-haul flights to low-budget subsidiary Transavia.
  
Air France-KLM has in recent years reacted to continuing losses by
shedding thousands of jobs. The French-Dutch partnership has by hit
from heavy competition from budget airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair
and Vueling.

Air France, Lufthansa buffeted by strikes
By Clare Byrne and Andrew McCathie, dpa   =
  
Paris (dpa) - European air traffic was poised for major disruptions
Monday as Air France pilots embarked on a week-long strike, forcing
the airline to cancel nearly half its flights, and Lufthansa pilots
also announced renewed industrial action.
  
Some 60 per cent of Air France pilots walked off the job Monday over
management's proposal to introduce lower wage packages for crews
working at Air France's low-cost Transavia subsidiary.
  
The strike, which is to run through September 22, is shaping up as
the most disruptive at Air France since 1998.
  
At Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris the airline's counters were
swamped by stranded passengers looking to be rebooked on other
flights.
  
Air France, which is compensating passengers for cancelled flights,
estimated the strike would set the company back between 10 and 15
million euros (13 million to 19 million dollars) a day, affecting
profits.
  
Lufthansa pilots, meanwhile, announced they would strike Tuesday for
the fourth time in three weeks as part of a campaign to head off a
planned new early retirement scheme.
  
Pilots at the airline's main Frankfurt hub will walk out at 9 am
(0700 GMT) on Tuesday, the Vereinigung Cockpit union announced.
  
"As Lufthansa management has not put forward an offer that is
suitable for a compromise, we see ourselves forced to take further
action," the union said.
  
1ST LEAD
The German airline said it was working on an emergency travel plan to
ease the impact of the strike, which could result in the cancellation
of up to 40 flights.
  
"The VC has lost all sense," said a Lufthansa spokesman. "Their
target is the passenger."
  
Last week, Lufthansa was forced to cancel about 140 flights at Munich
Airport.
  
This followed industrial action by pilots also at Frankfurt Airport
and a strike last month by pilots working for Lufthansa's budget
offshoot Germanwings.
  
Both Air France and Lufthansa are trying to cut costs to compete with
the likes of Ryanair, Vueling and other budget carriers.
  
Lufthansa wants to scrap a retirement plan under which its 5,400
pilots can retire at 55 and continue to receive part of their wages.
  
Air France wants to hire crews on smaller pay to build up its
low-cost business at Transavia.
  
In both cases, the pilots are resisting the changes.
  
Air France pilots are demanding a single contract for all the group's
pilots.
  
The strike comes as the Air France-KLM group was starting to turn a
corner after years of heavy losses that prompted thousands of job
cuts.
  
Last year, the group turned an operating profit for the first time in
three years. The group aims to achieve net profits by the end of
2015.

European airline Ryanair signed an agreement to
buy 100 jets from US airplane manufacturer Boeing, both companies
announced on their websites Monday.
  
The transaction, valued at 11 billion dollars, involves Boeing's new
737 Max 200 airplanes. Ryanair has the option to purchase an
additional 100 new 737 Max 200 planes, which could double the value
of the deal.
  
The low-cost carrier will be the first airline to operate the 737 Max

provide up to 20 per cent better fuel efficiency per seat than
single-aisle airplanes now in use, the statement said.
  
"Ryanair is proud and honoured to become the lead operator of
Boeing's 'game changer' 737 Max 200 aircraft, which will expand our
fleet to 520 aircraft by 2024," said Ryanair chief executive Michael
O'Leary in the statement.

Lufthansa pilots strike, flights for 25,000 passengers cancelled
By Jean-Baptiste Piggin, dpa   =
  
Frankfurt (dpa) - Pilots at German airline Lufthansa went on strike
for six hours late on Friday, forcing the cancellation of more than
200 scheduled flights and disrupting travel for 25,000 passengers.
  
Vereinigung Cockpit, the pilots' labour union, has been in months of
negotiations with the carrier over the terms of an early retirement
scheme.
  
Its members were refusing short and medium-haul take-offs from
Frankfurt Airport, Lufthansa's hub, until 11 pm (2100 GMT) Friday.
Late-night departures are banned at Frankfurt, so operations were not
set to resume until early Saturday.
  
Adding to transport snarls in Germany, a railway engineers' union,
the GDL, announced Friday that its members would refuse to drive
trains on Saturday from 6 am to 9 am as it pursues wage claims
against the main rail company, Deutsche Bahn.
  
Lufthansa had been relying on main-line express trains to help clear
some of the backlog from cancelled domestic flights.
  
The airline reserved 2,200 Frankfurt-area hotel rooms for stranded
travellers and was setting up 500 camp beds inside the airport
transit zone to accommodate any stranded passengers who lack visas to
leave the airport and enter the city to stay at hotels.
  
Lufthansa said the stoppage would cost it "millions of euros" but
refused to budge on the union's retirement plan claims.
  
The listed airline insists it must slash labour costs to remain
competitive against both low-cost European carriers such as RyanAir
and EasyJet and up-and-coming long-haul carriers such as Emirates and
Etihad.
  
1ST LEAD
While union members refused to fly jets to German and European
destinations out of Frankfurt, long-haul flights were not affected.
  
In response, Lufthansa scratched more than 200 flights from its
Friday schedule, including Frankfurt-bound flights departing three or
more hours earlier from other European capitals. The European network
was completely grounded an hour before the strike began.
  
Lufthansa said the pre-emptive cancellations were necessary so that
the airline could quickly resume normal services on Saturday.
  
Past strikes have left jets or crews stranded at the wrong airports,
meaning disruptions continued even after the pilots ceased striking.
  
Lufthansa said it had sent out 14,000 text messages offering
assistance to those passengers who had registered their mobile phone
numbers with the airline. It offered rebookings on other dates, on
other airlines or on trains for the shorter domestic connections.
  
Lufthansa criticized the union for striking on an end-of-summer
weekend when thousands of families are flying home to Germany from
vacations abroad and require onward domestic connections. School
holidays end this weekend in three out of 16 German states.
  
"That is an especial disgrace," said airline spokesman Andreas
Bartels on ZDF breakfast television.
  
The union is demanding full reinstatement of a benefit that formerly
allowed pilots to choose early retirement at 60 on partial pay. The
airline wants to wind up the benefit so fit pilots keep flying until
65.
  
A week earlier, the same union held a six-hour strike that hit planes
operated by Germanwings, a low-budget subsidiary of Lufthansa. That
strike took down 116 out of 164 scheduled departures, affecting
15,000 passengers.
  
Germans have been divided in response to strikes. Strikers who
complain about stagnant incomes after years of economic austerity in
Germany often gain public support. However pilots, who are among the
best-paid labour groups, have garnered much less public sympathy.

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Wednesday said it plans to

Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, told the BBC that a
"very positive meeting" was held with the Cypriot government and the
airline last week.
  
Ryanair is among fifteen companies that have submitted non-binding
expressions of interest in the loss-making airline, which is under
the control of the Cypriot government.
  
The Cypriot government owns more than 90 per cent of Cyprus Airways,
which has struggled to survive against cheaper competitors.
  
According to the newspaper Cyprus Mail, the Communication and Works
Ministry will evaluate all business plans. Companies that make the
shortlist will then be asked to file binding proposals.
  
The airline's new owner should be announced by the beginning of
October.

Brussels   
The European Union ordered France on Wednesday to
recoup almost 10 million euros (13 million dollars) from low-cost
airline Ryanair, finding that the airline was given an illegal
competitive advantage at three airports in the country.
  
"EU state aid rules ... allow public authorities to grant support
where it is justified, namely where it improves the accessibility of
a region and meets citizens' transport needs," EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
  
"However, taxpayers' money should not be used to grant an undue
advantage to certain airlines, distorting competition," he added.
  
At issue are contractual rebates, marketing arrangements and service
agreements granted to Ryanair and a subsidiary, Airport Marketing
Services, at regional airports in Angouleme, Nimes and Pau.
  
"These agreements could not have been reasonably expected to improve
the financial situation of the airport when they were entered into.
No private operator would have accepted to grant similar
conditions," the commission said in a statement.
  
It ordered Ryanair to repay approximately 868,000 euros in the case
of the Angouleme airport, 2.4 million euros in the case of the Pau
airport, and 6.4 million euros in the case of the Nimes airport.
  
At the Pau airport, the commission also found that low-cost carrier
Transavia gained an undue economic advantage through a contract
signed in 2006. France was told to recoup 400,000 euros from that
airline.
  
Benefits granted at regional airports have long been on the radar of
EU orders France to recoup nearly 10 million euros from Ryanair
EU regulators.
  
Separately on Wednesday, the commission closed investigations into
state aid at six regional airports, approving support that was given
to the three French airports, as well as to the German airports of
Dortmund, Leipzig Halle and Niederrhein-Weeze.

The Turkish company Pegasus Airlines
offers the most inexpensive flights on average within Europe.
  
With an average per-flight price of 64.64 euros (87.89 dollars),
Pegasus earned the top spot both with the basic price without baggage

comparison portal whichairline.com.
  
Second place without baggage went to the Irish company Ryanair, with
an average cost of 65.67 euros.
  
With flights including baggage, the Irish company drops to sixth
place with an average of 100.67 euros, behind Air Lituanica (81.36
euros), Vueling (97.24 euros), Germanwings (98.99 euros) and Wizz Air
(100.62 euros).

That annoying passenger ahead of you who abruptly
reclines his seat and ruins your flight may soon be a thing of a past
on short hauls as airlines refit.
  
Monarch Airlines, a British company, is already ripping out their
reclining seats and putting in seats that ensure more room for the
passenger behind by remaining upright, according to Monarch's
marketing boss Tim Williamson.
  
Ninety per cent of Monarch passengers voted to ban them, he said.
  
Monarch is not the only airline planning the move. Europe's biggest
carrier, the budget line Ryanair, is among others getting ready for
the change. Short-haul airlines are gradually reducing the space
between all their seats so they can pack more passengers into jets.

DPA CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT tourism special travel  Space is money: The battle for every centimetre in 
economy class   
By Jan Ahrenberg, dpa   =
  
Hamburg (dpa) - Discount air travel: good for your pocketbook, but
potentially lethal? If you read all the chat comments on travel blog
sites, you might come away with the impression that people can count
themselves lucky to survive economy class alive.
  
The cramped seating - so the general view - impairs blood
circulation, in turn leading to thromboses.
  
In fact, cheap travel is uncomfortable, but rarely deadly. It's all
really about the airlines' bottom line - space is money. The cheaper
you fly, the less elbow, knee and head-room you'll be offered.
  
"The layout of the passenger cabin is mainly determined by each
airline's business model," notes Ralf God, head of the institute of
airline cabin systems at Hamburg-Harburg Polytechnical University.
  
He says airlines are feverishly searching for ways to squeeze more
seats into an airplane in order to reduce costs and cut carbon
dioxide emissions. In this quest, even the weight of the seats is now
being reviewed.
  
"In the cabins of Lufthansa, there are seat models coming into use
which are basically just metal frames covered with fabric. They are
almost like garden chairs," God says. Such seats are 3.8 kilograms
lighter than the older models.
  
With the economy class of an Airbus having 120 seats, this means a
weight saving of almost half a ton. The airline says that this
could mean reducing kerosene consumption by 43 tons per airplane per
year.
  
A passenger might be impressed about the better environmental impact
Space is money: The battle for every centimetre in economy class
of his new seat, but it often means that he'll be occupying just 75
centimetres of space, as measured from one seat back to the next seat
back. This distance is known as "seat pitch."
  
There are some ways to get a tiny bit more room in economy class, as
Andrew Wong of the air travel advisory portal Seat Guru points out,
but you'll need to understand the basics of seating layout before you
book.
  
The most common planes in use nowadays are the Boeing 737 and Airbus
A320, conventionally with a layout of six seats across - three on
each side of a central aisle. The seats usually offer 74 to 79
centimetres of pitch in coach class.
  
That's not very generous, but survivable on short flights, say of two
to three hours.
  
The tightest legally permissible pitch is 71 centimetres, which the
Irish-based discount carrier Ryanair takes the most advantage of,
Wong points out.
  
Those seeking to maximize comfort on short-haul flights should pay
more attention to their seat allocation than to the name of the
airline, because just about every carrier is miserly with seat pitch.
  
  
Seats behind a cabin bulkhead or in the row where the emergency exit
is located are the ones to ask for, because of their extra leg room.
  
But they are quickly booked out for the same reason.
  
On long-distance flights, it pays to shop around. Here, the
competition is greater. Who wants to sit for a flight of six or even
10 hours squeezed in like a sardine?
  
So it pays to study the airlines' seating data. Pitch between seats
of 79 to 81 centimetres is the rule. The exceptions include the
best-in-comparison Thai Airways, which offers 83 to 86 centimetres of
pitch in economy class, Wong says.
  
The width of seats is also a comfort factor. The advantage of having
47 centimetres rather than 43 centimetres is something that not only
a weightier person will appreciate at the end of a long flight.
  
So it comes as bad news that some airlines are already experimenting
with rows of 10 seats - in space originally designed for nine.
  
"An airplane passenger cabin is one of the most expensive pieces of
real estate in the world, so there's a battle for every square
centimetre of space," says Rene Dankwerth, vice president of research
and development at the Recaro Aircraft Seating company of Germany.
  
"There is some room left for improvement when it comes to comfort and
ergonomics," he adds reassuringly. Newer seat sides are tapered, so
that you have a wide place to rest your arm, but more wiggle room for
your bottom.
  
Will there ever be more room again for economy passengers?
  
Dankwerth's answer is a cautious one.
  
"It depends on technological developments. If in the distant future,
Space is money: The battle for every centimetre in economy class
supersonic planes become prevalent, then space will become
tighter." That's because all flights will be like short hauls.
  
"But just the opposite is also possible. If solar-powered planes such
as the kind now being tried out come into use, then air travel will
get slower," Dankwerth said. Longer flights would raise the incentive
for airlines to allow more legroom.

DPA FINANCE Germany transport labour  NEWS FEATURE: Embattled Lufthansa digs in against pilot pay demands   
By Jean-Baptiste Piggin, dpa   =
  
Berlin (dpa) - To understand why Lufthansa, Europe's biggest airline,
is hunkering down and refusing to prolong generous pension rules for
its pilots, plane-spotting at a German airport offers a clue: a rash
of upstarts have brought new competition in Europe's skies.
  
Their names are still unfamiliar to many travellers: Vueling of
Spain, Wizz of Hungary, Flybe of Britain, and the list is long.
  
Ryanair, the giant of cheap and cheerful in Europe's skies, is
responding to passenger discontent and shifting operations from
obscure out-of-town airfields to main airports like those of
Barcelona and Brussels. EasyJet, another big player, keeps expanding.
  
On long-haul routes, where first and business class were
traditionally Lufthansa's money-spinners, a couple of Gulf airlines
are now setting the pace and luring away high-roller customers.
  
Dubai-based Emirates has sought economies of scale, ordering so many
gigantic A380 airliners that in a few years' time it will be
operating more than 140. That will be 10 times as many A380s as
Lufthansa has bought or ordered.
  
Emirates currently operates 118 flights daily in or out of Europe and
is seeking landing rights at more airports.
  
Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi has been expanding by acquisition. It
holds a key stake in Air Berlin, Germany's number-two airline, and
has been investigating Alitalia's finances with a view to taking over
the Italian airline.
  
"The world has completely changed for Lufthansa," said Commerzbank
analyst Frank Skodzik this week.
  
NEWS FEATURE: Embattled Lufthansa digs in against pilot pay demands
The lumbering German flag carrier finally spotted the threat in 2012
and is deep in a cost-cutting drive that has been spearheaded by its
outgoing chief, Christoph Franz. His successor, Carsten Spohr, set to
take over next month, has vowed to keep the screws tight.
  
At the same time it must refresh an ageing fleet and catch up with
rivals that have reshuffled their range of seat types.
  
Other airlines realized long ago that business-class passengers would
pay more if offered flat beds, while economy class travellers were
desperate for just a little more space in front of their seats.
  
Lufthansa will scrap first class in 30 big jets and from November
offer extra legroom in a new class, premium economy. The airline
forecasts premium economy will boost sales by 80 million euros (110
million dollars) in the first year.
  
To go after budget rivals, the group operates its own budget airline,
Germanwings, which is also reeling from the strike.
  
Last month, Lufthansa, which had skipped its previous dividend to
shareholders, promised a modest 45-euro-cents-per-share payout this
year, despite a 17-per-cent drop in 2013 operational earnings to 697
million euros.
  
That rallied Lufthansa stock, with analysts intoning that its vow of
2.65 billion euros in earnings in 2015 was believable.
  
But staff put a different interpretation on the results: Lufthansa
could afford to pay them more.
  
The pilots, who are grounding most of Lufthansa's flights for three
days this week, accuse the shareholders of "greed."
  
The 5,400 pilots want the airline to reintroduce contracts that gave
them the liberty to finish flying at the age of 55 and spending 10
years in leisure on 60 per cent of their previous gross earnings
until they reach the legal retirement age of 65.
  
"Pilots who don't feel fit any more shouldn't be forced to fly," said
Ilja Schulz, deputy leader of the pilots' VC union.
  
An experienced Lufthansa pilot can earn about 250,000 euros a year,
20 per cent more than German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At Ryanair,
pilots' pay tops out at just 150,000 euros annually.
  
Average Lufthansa pay is 181,000 euros, nearly double the
135,000-dollar income of the average captain at a major US airline.
  
After a two-year pay freeze, the airline has offered its pilots'
union a one-off bonus plus a two-step increase of 5.16 per cent over
a five-year period, but rejects early retirement, insisting today's
jets are fine for healthy pilots in their 60s to operate.
  
The German media are generally neutral in reporting strikes, but the
mass-circulation daily Bild this week accused the pilots of being the
greedy ones. "Still not enough," said Bild, triggering a wave of
Facebook and Twitter rage at the strikers.

DPA FINANCE Italy aviation Ryanair  Ryanair opening Rome hub, but alliance offer to Alitalia snubbed Rome   
Budget airline Ryanair said on Tuesday it would open a
new hub at Rome's Fiumicino airport, but an offer to strike an
alliance with Alitalia was snubbed by Italy's cash-strapped former
flag carrier.
  
Ryanair said it would station six aircraft at Fiumicino from
December 18, serving Palermo, Catania and Lamezia Terme in Italy, as
well as Barcelona and Brussels. There are plans to increase the fleet
to 10 or 12 in October 2014, it added.
  
Deputy chief executive Michael Cawley also said the Irish carrier
could run connecting flights from Italian airports to Fiumicino, for
passengers flying on Alitalia's international routes.
  
"We hope Alitalia will take up our offer to cooperate with them,"
Cawley told reporters in Rome.
  
The Italian carrier turned down the proposal, saying it had "its
own strategy, its own industrial plan and its own staff" and was able
to provide such feeder services on its own.
  
In a statement, it also complained about Ryanair's expansion to
Fiumicino, noting that "in all advanced countries" hub carriers and
low-cost airlines operate from different airports.
  
Had it taken up the partnership offer, Alitalia would have in
effect given up on battling against Ryanair on domestic routes,
focusing on more lucrative but also highly-competitive, international
connections.
  
Alitalia made a pre-tax loss of 162 million euros (220 million
dollars) in the first nine months of the year, compared to a loss of
119 million euros in the same period of 2012.
Ryanair opening Rome hub, but alliance offer to Alitalia snubbed
  
Its shareholders have until Wednesday to contribute to a 300
million euro (400 million dollar) capital increase that is key to
avoiding bankruptcy. The company also hopes to receive 200 million
euros in bank loans.
  
Air France-KLM, which has a 25 per cent stake and is Alitalia's
leading industrial partner, has refused to chip in. Italy's
publicly-owned postal service, in a move criticized as covert state
aid, is due to contribute, with 75 billion euros.
  
Ryanair, which issued a profit warning this month but still
expects to make 500-520 million euros by the end of the financial
year in March, already operates from Rome's smaller airport,
Ciampino.

DPA FINANCE Ireland aviation Ryanair  Ryanair shares down 11 per cent after profit warning London   
Shares in Ryanair were down 11 per cent in Dublin
on Monday, after the budget airline issued its second profit warning
in as many months, blaming downward pressure on fares.
  
The airline said it expected profits at the end of the financial
year in March to be between 500 million (675 million dollars) and 520
million euros, down from the 570 million to 600 million euros it
previously guided.
  
It will be the first drop in profit in five years.
  
It said the warning was "due entirely" to a "lower fare
environment", citing price competition, softer economic conditions in
Europe and a weak euro to sterling exchange rate.
  
It had launched "aggressive seat sales" to increase traffic but
expected fares to drop by 9 per cent in the third quarter and 10 per
cent in the fourth quarter, it said.
  
Releasing its half-year results, Europe's largest budget airline
by traffic said passenger numbers rose by 2 per cent to 49 million in
the six months to the end of September and said it had a record net
profit of 602 million euros.
  
In recent weeks the airline, headed by the notoriously blunt
Michael O'Leary, has attempted to improve its image with a series of
customer service measures.
  
In Monday's results statement it said it would also begin
allocating seating from February, in response to customer feedback.

DPA FINANCE Ireland aviation Ryanair  Ryanair in bid to improve customer service London   
Budget Irish airline Ryanair, whose chief executive
Michael O'Leary has in the past labelled some of his passengers
"idiots," on Friday announced a series of measures to improve
customer service.
  
In the past, O'Leary has insisted passengers only care about cheap
fares and punctuality. But in a recent U-turn, the outspoken Irishman
said his airline should try not to "unnecessarily piss people off."
  
On Friday the airline said over the next six months it would
increase the hand baggage allowance to allow for small ladies
handbags, and cut baggage and check-in fees. Passengers are also to
be given a 24-hour grace period in which to change minor errors in
their bookings.
  
O'Leary said the airline was "actively listening and responding to
our customers" as it implemented plans to increase its capacity from
80 million passengers per year to 110 million over the next five
years.
  
"We hope that our passengers will enjoy these service
improvements, while still enjoying Ryanair's low fares and on-time
flights," he added.
  
Last month a survey by the consumer magazine Which? rated Ryanair
the worst for customer service out of 100 big British brands.
  
The airline was also forced to apologize and refund a passenger
who had lost his entire family in a housefire after it refused to
change his flight and charged him 188 euros for a new ticket.

DPA FINANCE France transport aviation  Strike causes flight cancellations, delays in France Paris   
A strike by French air traffic controllers Thursday
over the EU's plans to centralize control of European airspace forced
airlines to cancel dozens of short-haul flights.
  
The French civil aviation authority DGAC said that the work
stoppage would mainly impact flights within France and to Spain,
Portugal and North Africa but flights through French airspace were
also expected to be affected.
  
Airlines had been asked to cancel 10 per cent of the day's
flights, DGAC said in a statement. Low-cost carrier Ryanair said it
had cancelled 87 flights.
  
The strike is the second since June by unions protesting the
European Union's Single European Sky initiative. The largest union
USAC-CGT did not join in the action, which was called by two smaller
unions, limiting the impact.
  
The EU says centralizing the continent's airspace will reduce
congestion and inefficiencies that cost airlines and passengers an
estimated 5 billion euros (6.6 billion dollars) a year.
  
But some workers fear the reforms will lead to more difficult
working conditions and job cuts.

Paris   
A French court on Wednesday ordered Irish low-cost
carrier Ryanair to pay 8 million euros (10.1 million dollars) in
damages and fines for breaching labour laws by failing to declare
local staff hired on foreign contracts.
  
The court in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence said Ryanair's
failure to pay French social charges for 127 staff who were based at
its Marseille hub between 2007 and 2011.
  
The case was brought by the French social security body, Urssaf,
the jobs office Pole Emploi, the state pension fund, and unions
representing cabin crew and pilots.
  
Ryanair had argued that, since the crew worked for
an Irish-registered airline and on Irish-registered aircraft, "they
are considered to be working principally in Ireland and not in
France."
  
Given that the airline had already paid social security taxes and
pension contributions in Ireland it could not be expected to pay them
again in France, the company argued.
  
Ryanair said a 2006 law requiring foreign airlines with French
bases to adhere to French labour laws was aimed solely at boosting
"loss-making Air France" and said the matter could only be resolved
by European courts.
  
"Should Ryanair be ultimately forced to pay these social taxes and
pension contributions in France, then the vast majority of these
contributions will be reclaimable from the Irish government," it said
in a statement.

The company closed its permanent Marseille hub in 2011.

Paris   
A Ryanair flight from the Scottish city of Glasgow
to the Spanish resort island of Ibiza had to divert to a French
airport after a group of drunken passengers started a ruckus, French
media reports and sources said Wednesday.
  
The incident took place on Tuesday around 8:00 p.m. (1800 GMT),
about an hour from the flight's scheduled arrival in Ibiza, M6
television channel reported.
  
A group of Scottish passengers, who had been drinking, began
dancing and making a racket "to the point of destabilizing the
aircraft," the channel reported.
  
The report said the pilot had to make an emergency landing at
Beauvais airport, 90 kilometres north of Paris, but the airport's
management told dpa the pilot diverted the aircraft merely as a
precautionary measure
  
"Some people on board were drunk and started behaving abnormally
and playing up and the pilot decided he did not want to continue the
flight with them," airport management told dpa, adding: "It was a
minor incident. It happens all the time."
  
The passengers involved in the disturbances were questioned by
airport police and later released without charge. The flight
continued on to Ibiza Tuesday evening without them.
  
The flight's crew have filed a criminal complaint over the
incident, Agence France-Presse reported. Neither Ryanair nor Beauvais
police were immediately available for comment.

France   
Europe's Airbus had the edge over the
US's Boeing in the planemakers' biennial sales showdown at the Paris
Air Show this week, receiving orders and commitments for 466
aircraft, compared with Boeing's 442.
  
Airbus's performance put it on course to exceed its target of 800
orders for aircraft this year. At the half-year mark the French-based
manufacturer had received orders for 758 planes, CEO Fabrice Bregier
announced.
  
Boeing's year-to-date tally comes to 692.
  
After four days for industry professionals, the world's biggest
airshow opens to the public on Friday. President Francois Hollande
will be among the visitors.
  
The crowd will be treated to a flyover of Airbus's ultramodern
A350. The wide-body, long-haul twin-jet had its maiden flight only a
week ago, at Airbus's home in Toulouse.
  
The plane, which is scheduled for delivery in late 2014, is
designed to compete with Boeing's popular 787 Dreamliner in the
lucrative long-haul market. Both use lightweight composite materials
to dramatically reduce fuel consumption.
  
With fuel prices remaining stubbornly high, airlines have been
racing to replace older gas-guzzlers with newer models.
  
Both Airbus and Boeing received billions of dollars in orders and
commitments at the show at Le Bourget airport.
  
Airbus received firm orders for 241 aircraft and commitments on a

further 225. The deals had a list value of 68.7 billion dollars but
double-digit discounts are habitual in the industry.
  
One of the biggest orders came from German aircraft leasing
company Doric, which took 20 double-deck A380, the world's biggest
airplane.
  
The smaller A320 Neo - a new version of the single-aisle A320 with
more fuel-efficient engines - was also in strong demand.
  
Boeing booked its biggest ever European order from Irish low-cost
airline Ryanair, which finalized an order for 175 737-800 jets, the
current version of the Boeing classic.
  
The orders and commitments received by Boeing had a catalogue
value of over 66 billion dollars, the company said.
  
Boeing, which dominates Airbus in the long-haul market, also
launched a new stretched version of the Dreamliner at the show.
  
In a sign of the potential for the 787-10, the company received
102 provisional orders, even though it is only scheduled for delivery
in 2018.

DPA FINANCE France transport labour EU  LEAD: European air travel heavily disrupted by French strike   
Eds: Updates with new cancellations, Belgian union's response   =
  
Paris (dpa) - Up to three-quarters of flights to and from France's
main airports were cancelled Wednesday, as air traffic controllers
stepped up a two-day strike over EU plans to centralize control of
European airspace.
  
The French civil aviation authority said that "nearly 100 per
cent of air traffic controllers" had observed the strike on the
second day of the protest, which saw other unions join in the work
stoppage.
  
As a result, the DGAC asked airlines to cut a further 25 per cent
of their flights through Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in
Paris, as well as in Beauvais, Lyon, Nice, Marseille, Toulouse and
Bordeaux.
  
The airlines had already been asked to cancel half their flights -
around 1,800 - on each day.
  
The latest cancellations affected a further 250 flights, a DGAC
spokeswoman said.
  
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, said it had been
forced to cancel 250 flights on Wednesday, after cutting more than
200 flights on Tuesday. Hundreds more flights around Europe had been
delayed, the airline said.
  
The strike has affected not only flights to and from France but
also flights through French airspace to other destinations.
  
German carrier Lufthansa cancelled over 50 flights on Wednesday,
including some flights to Spain and Italy.
  
Air France warned its passengers that the situation was "very
LEAD: European air travel heavily disrupted by French strike
disrupted." While the airline still aimed to maintain all its
long-haul flights to and from Paris, its short and medium-haul
flights were "heavily impacted" and last-minute cancellations could
not be excluded.
  
The strike was set to end at 0400 GMT on Thursday.
  
It was originally planned as a three-day protest, but the SNCTA
trade union which led the strike announced it would shorten it by a
day after France and Germany wrote to the EU to ask it to postpone
its Single European Sky initiative.
  
The EU says centralizing the continent's airspace will reduce
congestion and inefficiencies that cost airlines and passengers an
estimated 5 billion euros (6.6 billion dollars) a year.
  
"If we leave things as they are, we will be confronted with heavy
congestion and chaos in our airspace," EU Transport Commissioner Siim
Kallas warned.
  
The unions say they fear the reforms will lead to more difficult
working conditions and job cuts. But not all agree with the strike.
  
Belgium's biggest union of air traffic controllers, the BGATC, has
rejected calls by the European Transport Workers Federation for a
Europe-wide protest.
  
The BGATC said talks between airlines and aviation authorities
would be more constructive than "preventive actions in which
passengers are the only victims."

yearly profits as it continued to grow, despite the economic crisis
in Europe and higher fuel costs.
  
The Ireland-based company said annual profit stood at 569 million
euros (731 million dollars), 13 per cent higher than last year.
  
A 5-per-cent rise in traffic levels to 79.3 million passengers
lifted revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31 by 13 per cent to
4.88 billion euros, the company said in a statement.
  
It warned that the recession across much of the EU would dampen
2014 profits, which it expects to be in the range of 570-600 million
euros.
  
The company has received 15 new aircraft, opened seven new bases,
and launched 217 new routes.

DPA CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT dpa special lifestyle  Animal-hair allergy sufferers should carry medication 
when pets fly Goettingen, Germany   
Some airlines are allowing passengers
to take cats and dogs with them on holiday, especially on short-haul
flights, despite the fears of allergy sufferers of high-altitude
rashes.
  
Passengers with animal-hair allergies should notify desk staff at
check-in about their condition as airline agents can see where
animals are located on the flight and seat the allergy sufferers
further away, said Florian Graenzdoerffer from Lufthansa of Germany.
  
If the passenger has neglected to mention an allergy at check-in,
flight attendants on board can look for an alternative seat, says
Kathrin Zirkel of a German airline, Air Berlin.
  
Despite sitting further away, an allergic reaction may still
occur. Typical symptoms of an animal hair allergy are itchy eyes, a
runny nose and shortness of breath.
  
Thomas Fuchs from the Association of German Allergologists
suggests having emergency medication on hand while travelling.
Individuals affected could also take an antihistamine before
departure.
  
"That can curb less pronounced reactions," said Fuchs, who works
at Goettingen University Clinic.
  
Lufthansa says it allows up to two cherished pets per flight on
its smaller jets and up to six per flight on big jets.
  
"We wouldn't want our planes to turn into flying zoos," said
Graenzdoerffer.
  
Animal-hair allergy sufferers should carry medication when pets fly
European budget airlines are less accommodative. Both Ryanair and
Easyjet ban pets, apart from seeing-eye dogs.

Eds: Adds Ryanair, Aer Lingus reax in grafs 9-11   =
  
Brussels (dpa) - The European Union on Wednesday blocked Irish
low-cost airline Ryanair from a hostile takeover of Aer Lingus, the
EU executive announced, citing competition concerns.
  
The merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or
market dominance on 46 routes currently contested by the two
airlines, the European Commission found.
  
"This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led
to price increases for consumers travelling on these routes," the
commission wrote in a statement.
  
"The commission's decision protects more than 11 million Irish and
European passengers who travel each year to and from (the Irish
cities of) Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon," said EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
  
Ryanair had sought to address EU competition concerns by offering
to sell parts of its short-haul business to rivals such as Britain's
Flybe, as well as giving up take-off and landing slots at London
airports, but failed to convince the EU's antitrust regulator.
  
"Those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious
competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no
less than 46 routes," Almunia said.
  
The commission rejected the concessions in part because it found
that Flybe would probably not have the resources to maintain a rival
network over the long term.
  
Ryanair already holds almost 30 per cent of shares in Aer Lingus.
  
Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, saying: "Business and leisure
2ND LEAD: EU blocks Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus
travellers are well served by the vigorous competition that has been
preserved between these two carriers."
  
But Ryanair said it would take the issue to the European Court of
Justice. The carrier issued a statement accusing the commission of a
"'political' decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish
government," which has a 25-per-cent share in Aer Lingus.
  
The ruling was "not ... based on a fair and reasonable application
of EU competition rules or precedent airline merger approvals," the
low-cost carrier wrote.
  
Ryanair has twice before tried to acquire Aer Lingus. The first
attempt in 2007 was blocked by the EU, also over competition
concerns. Ryanair itself abandoned the second attempt in 2009.

DPA FINANCE EU justice aviation  Airlines have duty of care after volcano eruptions, EU court rules 
Luxembourg   
Airlines' duty to care for passengers, when
flights have been cancelled under extraordinary circumstances,
extends to volcanic eruptions, the European Union's top court ruled
Thursday.
  
Its verdict came in a case against low-cost carrier Ryanair, which
was forced to ground flights following the eruption of Icelandic
volcano Eyjafjallajokull in 2010, causing the closure of European
airspace for a week.
  
The case was brought by a passenger who was stranded in the
southern Portuguese city of Faro for seven days when her flight to
Dublin was cancelled. Since Ryanair provided no care, she argued that
the airline owed her compensation of almost 1,130 euros (1,500
dollars).
  
"The air carrier must provide free of charge ... refreshments,
meals and, where appropriate, hotel accommodation and transport
between the airport and place of accommodation, as well as means of
communication with third parties," the European Court of Justice
found.
  
It rejected Ryanair's claim that the volcano eruption went beyond
the "extraordinary circumstances" in which such care is due.
  
"EU law does not recognize a separate category of 'particularly
extraordinary' events, beyond 'extraordinary circumstances', which
would lead to the air carrier being exempted from all its
obligations," the court said.
  
However, airlines could estimate the additional cost of looking
after stranded passengers and calculate this into ticket prices, the
Airlines have duty of care after volcano eruptions, EU court rules
court found.
  
The Luxembourg-based judges also found that no additional
compensation was due, over and above the "amounts which proved
necessary, appropriate and reasonable to make up for the shortcomings
of the air carrier."
  
A Dublin court had asked the EU legal authority whether the
closure of airspace following a volcanic eruption constituted
"extraordinary substances." The Irish court will pass the final
verdict on the amount of repayment due.

Air France on Monday sought to stem the exodus of
European customers to low cost rivals Easyjet and Ryanair by
launching a new range of cheap fares on 58 short- and medium-haul
destinations.
  
The Mini fares start at 49 euros (64 dollars) one-way, including
tax. Checked bags costs an additional 15-30 euros.
  
Air France said the new fares target "the 60 per cent of customers
who are looking for the best possible fares and the 40 per cent of
short and medium-haul customers travelling without checked baggage."
  
"We're not becoming a low-cost airline, we are continuing to offer
the Air France quality of service," chief executive Alexandre de
Juniac said.
  
The European pages on Air France's website were down on Monday
morning as the airline struggled to cope with demand for the new
fares, which are available on flights starting February 6.

Ireland's government Tuesday  opposed a

saying there was no advantage for Ireland in the deal.
  
Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said the government would not sell
its holdings in Aer Lingus to support the hostile takeover attempt by
Irish rival Ryanair.
  
Ryanair is making its third bid to corral a majority in Aer
Lingus, a move that also would require approval by the European
Commission. The commission has expressed concern about the
consequence of a takeover, such as reduction of competition on many
flight paths.
  
Ryanair has held about 30 per cent of Aer Lingus for years. Its
first takeover attempt was rejected by the European Union in 2007,
and it withdrew from its second bid. For British anti-trust
officials, even that 30-per-cent holding in Aer Lingus is a thorn in
its side.

DPA FINANCE Ireland business Ryanair  LEAD: Ryanair profits from passenger growth in austere times   
Eds: Recasts, adds quotes, profit forecast   =
  
London (dpa) - Tight traveller budgets at times of recession are
behind Ryanair's 10-per-cent increase in net profit to 596 million
euros (765 million dollars) in the six months to September, propelled
by a record rise in passenger numbers, the airline said Monday.
  
Ryanair was "benefiting from austerity across Europe" as it
managed to keep prices down, said chief executive Michael O'Leary at
a presentation of half-yearly results in London.
  
"The price gap between us and the competition is getting bigger.
People are coming to Ryanair for the price and they are coming back
again and again for our new aircraft and the punctuality of our
flights," said O'Leary.
  
He predicted that Ryanair would continue to benefit from a
consolidation in the industry and from "the effect of the recession
on loss-making carriers around Europe which are now cutting back."
  
The airline said that the "robust" result was because of a
combination of strong bookings and lower fuel costs. Ryanair, which
raised prices by an average 6 per cent, said overall fuel costs rose
by 24 per cent to 218 million euros during the period.
  
O'Leary's upbeat assessment came after the Dublin-based airline
said profits had risen by 10 per cent between April and September,
compared with 544 million euros for the same period in 2011.
  
Passenger numbers rose by an average 6 per cent, from 44.7 million
to 48 million, as revenue increased by 15 per cent to 3.1 billion
euros.
  
The airline raised its profit forecast for the full year to
490-520 million euros, from earlier estimates of 400-440 million
LEAD: Ryanair profits from passenger growth in austere times
euros.
  
O'Leary said reports about alleged safety concerns at Ryanair -
relating mainly to allegations that the aircraft were carrying
minimum levels of fuel - had been exaggerated, and the issue had been
settled.
  
Ryanair had been assured by the relevant authorities that it
complied fully with European Union safety procedures.
  
Under its 10-year strategy, Ryanair planned to acquire 200 new
aircraft, while hoping to increase passenger numbers from currently
80 million a year to 120 million over the next five to 10 years.
  
It was important for Ryanair to break into markets in Europe where
competition was still lacking, said O'Leary. Prices for short-haul
flights had come down dramatically in Europe because of the "choice
provided by Ryanair."
  
"Further airline failures and consolidation are inevitable," he
said.
  
The carrier, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day across
28 countries, recently said it would add nine new routes to three
regional airports in Britain, creating 1,000 jobs. Potential for
growth would come mainly from central and eastern Europe.
  
However, the airline expected traffic to be "broadly flat" over
the current six-month period. Ryanair would ground up to 80 aircraft
over the winter as a result of high oil prices, airport fares and
seasonally weaker demand.
  
It said it expected "market conditions in Europe to remain tough
as recession, austerity, high fuel costs and excessive government
taxes dampen air travel demand."
  
O'Leary said he was determined to pursue Ryanair's bid to take
over Irish airline Aer Lingus, in which it already holds 30 per cent.
He was confident that the European Commission would vote in favour of
the bid.

Italian prosecutors are pressing charges against the

Ryanair chief executive officer Michael O'Leary and the director

having used the expedient for 220 people at Bergamo airport, in
northern Italy.
  
Labour taxes are around 12 per cent in Ireland, compared to 37 per
cent in Italy. Labour officials have calculated that Ryanair's
methods have saved the company 12 million euros (15.5 million
dollars) in social security payments, Corriere della Sera said.
  
Labour officials spotted the alleged irregularities in late 2011.
Ryanair was then given three months to pay up and avoid prosecution.
The company declined to take up the offer, insisting that its
practices are legal under European Union laws.

Eds: epa file photos   =
  
Rome (dpa) - A businessman's suggestion to rename a struggling
local airport in northern Italy after Benito Mussolini in order to
increase its "visibility" has sparked an outcry, Italian media
reported Monday.
  
The idea to rebrand the airport in Forli, a town 75 kilometers
east of Bologna, comes from Massimo Balzani, local representative of
the Italian business association Confindustria, centre-left daily La
Repubblica wrote.
  
Balzani first made the proposal in an interview last week with Il
Resto Del Carlino, a regional newspaper which ran a picture of him
posing with a bust of "Il Duce."
  
"I am not saying that his policies should not be analysed and
examined, even negatively. But this does not mean that we should
forget that this airport was created by Mussolini," he said.
  
"Using the name of Mussolini would ensure greater visibility,"
said Balzani, who denied being a fascist.
  
The businessman has been rebuffed by local leaders, La Repubblica
said.
  
"It is such a foolish thing that I did not even comment on it,"
Forli mayor Roberto Balzani - who is not related - told the paper.
The proposal "is completely ill-judged," said Aurelio Regina, a
deputy national leader of Confindustria.
  
The Italian partisans association ANPI protested too, recalling
that 42 civilians were shot on the airport's premises by Mussolini's
German Nazi allies in 1944.
  
Under Italian law, expressing support for fascist ideology is a
crime. In recent months, controversy has also erupted over a monument
Italian businessman wants to rename local airport after Mussolini
erected in a small town in Lazio, the region around Rome, dedicated
to fascist general Rodolfo Graziani.
  
Forli airport is currently named after Luigi Ridolfi, a local
aviator. The publicly-owned facility, once used by Ryanair but
currently serving only two low cost airlines, Wizzair and Belleair,
is laden with debts and may be closed if no private buyers are found.

A report by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has
concluded that three Ryanair emergency landings in Spain in July were
in line with European security standards, the low-cost airline's
chief executive Michael O'Leary said Thursday.
  
The preliminary report, which has not been made public, was quoted
by O'Leary at a press conference in Madrid.
  
Ryanair security had been questioned in Spain following a string
of unplanned landings at several Spanish airports.
  
They included three emergency landings in Valencia on July 26
because of lack of fuel. Ryanair says the planes were en route to
Madrid, but were forced to fly to Valencia because of stormy weather,
and to circulate above the city before being able to land.
  
The IAA concluded that the landings respected the European Union's
security and operational norms, O'Leary said. The IAA also
recommended that Ryanair revise its fuel policy and issue a guide to
aircraft crews on the issue.
  
The Spanish Air Security Agency (AESA) is still investigating the
Valencia landings, according to government sources. A Spanish
ombudswoman has also announced an investigation into Ryanair
security.
  
The Irish carrier has never had an accident in its nearly three
decades of existence, O'Leary stressed.

DPA FINANCE Europe aviation  NEWS FEATURE: Unplanned Ryanair landings prompt questions in Spain   
By Christian Ebner, dpa   =
  
Frankfurt (dpa) - A series of recent unplanned landings by Ryanair
aircraft flying to Spanish destinations has tarnished the Irish
budget carrier's image - built upon its ruthless cost-cutting and
strident advertising - with questions about its safety record.
  
Spanish transport officials were due to meet their Irish
counterparts in Dublin to discuss tighter security controls, senior
official Rafael Catala said. Madrid has also requested a meeting with
European Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas.
  
The European Commission meanwhile offered to assist in the
exchange of information in such cases, and said there were plans to
create a database on incidents and occurrences in aviation safety.
  
The unplanned landings last week were attributed to a technical
problem, an engine problem and turbulence in the air.
  
A couple of weeks ago, pilot associations in Spain also accused
Ryanair of putting pressure on pilots to carry as little fuel as
possible to cut costs.
  
Three unplanned landings in July were, in fact, caused by aircraft
running low on fuel. However, there is no evidence that Ryanair is
taking chances with the safety of its passengers.
  
Nevertheless, suspicion has taken root among the public, as the
airline is constantly emphasizing how cheap its tickets are. The
Ryanair website advertises London to Budapest at a mere 18 pounds (30
dollars).
  
The seats are all but given away, with the airline making use of
all kinds of fees and surcharges to boost revenues, from credit card
levies to baggage charges.
NEWS FEATURE: Unplanned Ryanair landings prompt questions in Spain
  
Chief executive Michael O'Leary revels in announcing new
cost-cutting and revenue-raising schemes, although one that received
widespread publicity - to charge passengers for using on-board
toilets - has not been implemented.
  
But no airline can afford a discussion on its safety. Following
the recent unplanned landings, O'Leary insisted there was strict
adherence to all regulations.
  
"Ryanair has not managed to create a positive safety image for
itself," says Hamburg-based aviation expert Heinrich Grossbongardt.
Nevertheless, he sees the airline - founded in 1985 - as being just
as safe as all other major European airlines.
  
Ryanair's business model ensures that it looks after its fleet of
294 aircraft with care, as the Boeing 737s have to be in the air for
as many hours as possible every day. "That only works with aircraft
maintained in the best condition," Grossbongardt says.
  
Ryanair makes exclusive use of the Boeing 737-800 to reduce
maintenance costs. The 737, introduced in the 1960s, is the
best-selling aircraft in the history of aviation. It is regarded as
one of the safest, at least in its current format.
  
Ryanair - like its main competitor Easyjet, which uses Airbus
aircraft - takes advantage of maintaining a relatively new fleet. The
Ryanair fleet is, on average, just over four years old. It is thus
newer and less prone to needing repairs than the older fleets
maintained by the bigger carriers.
  
The business model includes selling the jets, which are bought in
large numbers at a considerable discount to the official list price,
before they age.
  
Ryanair and its competitors cut costs at every opportunity. They
make use of minor airports charging lower fees, cut marketing costs
to a minimum through internet sales, and pay their staff well below
the rates paid by the major airlines.
  
Staff costs make up less than 10 per cent of turnover, much lower
than at Lufthansa, where the figure is above 23 per cent.
  
According to international safety data kept by the Jet Airliner
Crash Data Evaluation Center (Jacdec), the low-cost carriers have
respectable records. Easyjet ranked 19 and Ryanair 28 in 2011, both
of them ahead of Air France and Iberia.
  
The German pilots' association Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) has been a
critic of the fuel policies of the low-cost carriers, but it fails to
see any systemic problem following the unplanned landings.
  
"These incidents need to be investigated by the authorities. We
cannot say anything further at the moment," VC spokesman Joerg
Handwerg said.
  
German aviation expert Cord Schellenberg praises the Ryanair
pilots for being open about problems when in the air. "A safety
landing announced beforehand and monitored by the aviation
authorities is in fact a safe landing," he says.

Spain wants to discuss the imposition of tighter
safety controls on foreign carriers after two Ryanair planes were
last week forced to land before reaching their destinations due to
technical problems, a senior official said on Monday.
  
Transport official Rafael Catala said Spain has requested an
immediate meeting with European Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas
and the Irish civil aviation authorities to discuss a safety row with
the low-cost Irish carrier.
  
Ryanair blamed a "small technical problem" for an unplanned
landing in Madrid on Sunday of a plane on its way from Paris to
Tenerife.
  
On Saturday, a Ryanair plane en route from Bristol in Britain to
Reus in north-eastern Spain made an emergency landing in Barcelona.
Spanish civil aviation authorities said the plane had a problem with
one of its engines.
  
Last week, a Ryanair plane headed for Palma de Majorca made an
emergency landing there because of turbulence in the air. Two crew
members and one passenger were reported slightly injured.
  
Ryanair on Monday denied having security problems. It said
unplanned landings showed how seriously the company took safety.
  
Ryanair dismissed the landings as isolated incidents in a total of
more than 1,500 daily flights.
  
In July, Ryanair planes made three emergency landings in the
eastern Spanish city of Valencia because they were running short on
fuel. The airline said the planes were en route to Madrid, but were

Ryanair's latest attempt to take over Irish rival
Aer Lingus poses "potential competition concerns," the European Union
said Wednesday, and announced that antitrust regulators are launching
an investigation into the merger.
  
"Ryanair and Aer Lingus are the main operators out of Dublin
airport. On a large number of European routes, mainly out of Ireland,
the two airlines are each other's closest competitors," the EU's
executive, the European Commission, said in a statement.
  
"Many of these routes are currently only served by the two
airlines. The takeover could therefore lead to the elimination of
actual and potential competition on a large number of these routes,"
it added.
  
The commission has until January to rule on whether the merger
would "significantly impede" competition in Europe.
  
Ryanair has twice before tried to acquire Aer Lingus. The first
attempt in 2007 was blocked by the EU over competition concerns,
while Ryanair itself ended the second attempt in 2009.

The Spanish Infrastructure Ministry has opened an
investigation into three emergency landings by Irish carrier Ryanair,
ministry sources said Tuesday.
  
Ryanair planes made three emergency landings in the eastern
Spanish city of Valencia on July 26 because they were running short

The airline had "seriously endangered passenger security," said
the consumers' association Ceaccu, which called for a fine of 4.5
million euros (5.5 million dollars) for Ryanair if the investigation
confirms wrongdoing.
  
Ceaccu also wants Ryanair's operating licence to be suspended for
three years.
  
Ryanair attributed the emergency landings to the fact that the
planes were en route to Madrid, but were forced to fly on to Valencia
because of stormy weather in the Spanish capital.
  
Each of the planes had to circulate above Valencia for about an
hour, the airline said. They landed normally, still having enough
fuel for half an hour, it said.

DPA CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT dpa special travel  London on a budget - some tips to help your wallet   
By Merle Schmalenbach, dpa   =
  
London (dpa) - You can already notice the money saving at the
airport. Those who book low-budget flights to London might see a lot
of sweating passengers. The reason is that they are wearing several
layers of clothes, because discount carriers such as Ryanair now
charge money for every piece of luggage.
  
But, the tickets are cheap. For example a round-trip fare from
Berlin to London can less than 100 euros (122 dollars). Hardcore
cost-cutters will do without luggage and will bring their own
home-made sandwiches.
  
Once at Stansted airport outside London, a cost-conscious
traveller will avoid taking the fast, but expensive, train into the
city. Instead, there is the National Express bus. It takes up to 90
minutes to get to the city centre, but costs only 8.50 pounds (13.25
dollars). It becomes even cheaper if you immediately purchase a
round-trip ticket, or book both tickets ahead of time on the
internet.
  
The bus stops at Liverpool Street - where you should buy an Oyster
card for the underground, which means you won't have to spend more
than 8.40 pounds per day for the central London area. This ticket
permits a traveller to ride the double-decker buses on Lines 11 and
15, which pass by many of the city's attractions.
  
But what do you do about a ticket to Madame Tussaud's that costs
almost 50 dollars? Visitors on a tight budget can easily do without
the wax museum thrills. Instead, they can head to public cultural
facilities. Almost all the museums are free of charge, such as the
National Gallery with its collection of Old Masters paintings, the
British Museum that has the famous Rosetta Stone, and the Science
Museum with its Puffing Billy steam locomotive from 1813.
  
London on a budget - some tips to help your wallet
Fans of modern art should head to the Tate Modern, which has works
by Picasso, Warhol and Matisse. It's also rewarding to visit the
smaller Sir John Soane's Museum, which was the residence of the 19th
century architect and collector of curiosities. Visitors can stroll
through the small rooms containing a 3,000-year-old Egyptian
sarcophagus, Roman urns and paintings.
  
An insider's tip is also the Geffrye Museum that shows how the
British middle class lived in previous centuries. It is located on
Kingsland Road which, at first glance, seems unspectacular, but has
many Vietnamese restaurants where one can dine for cheap.
  
Those who want to head to the theatre after dinner might still
acquire standing-room tickets for the Donmar Warehouse for about 13
dollars. And many West End shows offer discount tickets that can be
bought at Leicester Square or in the Brent Cross Shopping Centre.
  
An overnight stay in London does not have to be expensive. During
the summer semester break many colleges, including the famous London
School of Economics, offer lodgings. The rooms are in great demand,
so booking several months ahead of time is advisable.
  
For those who are not shy about close quarters, it is possible to
book a bed rather than a room. Very stylish in this regard is the inn
Palmers Lodge, which is located in the villa of a biscuit
manufacturer. One can book a bed in a 28-bed room starting at about
20 dollars, including breakfast.
  
Curtains and a chest that can be locked provide a bare minimum of
privacy, not enough of course to block the sound of snoring from the
next bed. The best thing to do is to hang out at the hostel's bar and
socialize with the international guests as long as possible. The next
morning, breakfast will include fresh croissants, coffee and juice.
  
For lunch, a good bet are the many Indian restaurants along Brick
Lane. Dinners for less than 17 dollars can be found in, for example,
the Shampan. Those searching for cheap beverages should head to the
second-hand shop Blitz on Hanbury Street, where you can enjoy an
espresso for about 2.50 dollars while leaning back in a sofa and
watching the trend-setters shop.
  
Reinforced from their repast, London tourists move on to search
for gifts. It's best to avoid the expensive souvenir shops and
instead find a flea market, such as the Brick Lane Market, open on
Sundays until 2 pm.
  
Here you can find old cameras, sunglasses or jewelry. But
traveller beware: If you have come over on a discount air carrier,
then don't purchase too much, because your carry-on baggage might be
stuffed or your suitcase might cost more because it exceeds the
weight limit.

Irish airline Ryanair on Monday reported a

An 11-per-cent increase in turnover to 1.3 billion euros (1.6

resulting from rising fuel costs.
  
"Our outlook remains cautious for the year," Ryanair chief
executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
  
He expected 2012/13 profits to drop to between 400 million and 440

Fuel prices rose 27 per cent and accounted for 47 per cent of
total operating costs, O'Leary said.

London   
Irish budget airline Ryanair Monday reported a
25-per-cent rise in profits to 503 million euros (643 million
dollars) in the financial year up to the end of March.
  
The company said revenue rose by 19 per cent to 4.3 billion euros,
as fare increases helped to offset rising fuel costs over the period.
  
Traffic grew by 5 per cent as fares rose by 16 per cent on
average, which helped to overcome a 30-per-cent rise in fuel costs.
  
However, Ryanair warned that profits in the current financial year
could be lower. It forecast annual profits of between 400 million and
440 million euros for the year to the end of March 2013.
  
The recession, austerity, currency concerns and lower fares at new
bases in Hungary, Poland, Britain and Spain would make it difficult
to repeat this year's results, the company stated.

DPA x Germany accidents aviation  Airport authorities confirm Ryanair emergency landing in Germany Berlin   
A Ryanair jet made an emergency landing in Germany
this week after the plane lost cabin pressure during a flight from
Italy to Britain, German airport police said on Friday.
  
The plane, which had 132 passengers and six crew on board, landed
at noon on Wednesday at Hahn Airport, Ryanair's hub in Germany, a
police spokesman said. It had been on a flight from Bergamo to East
Midlands Airport.
  
Thirteen people were treated for minor injuries such as ear drum
damage from the sudden dip in air pressure and rapid descent.
  
Germany's aviation safety authority, the Braunschweig-based German
Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation, examined the jet
on the ground on Thursday, said police at Hahn, a small town airport
100 kilometres to the west of Frankfurt.
  
British news reports quoted passengers saying there was a bang and
then a rush of cold air through the plane.
  
One passenger, Jacqueline Frater, said many of those on board were
afraid. She was quoted saying on BBC News that the captain could be
overheard on the public address system saying "Mayday, mayday."
  
The BBC and other British media quoted budget airline Ryanair
confirming the incident and saying the captain descended from 31,000
feet to 10,000 feet after pressure was lost. The airline apologized
to passengers affected by the diversion and delay.
  
Frater said children and babies were crying from the ear pain.
  
The passengers were later taken on to East Midlands Airport on
another plane.

Brussels   
A southern France airport used exclusively by
Ryanair has landed under the microscope of European Union regulators,
amid suspicions that it received millions in inappropriate state aid
and has granted the low-cost airline an undue competitive advantage.
  
The EU's executive said it will probe if deals between Ryanair and
the Carcassonne airport on "marketing support contracts and discounts
on airport charges" were preferential, in violation of EU rules.
  
"The (European) Commission has concerns that such arrangements
could give the airline, sole commercial user of the airport, an undue
economic advantage that its competitors do not enjoy," it said.
  
The commission's investigation will also look into "financial
arrangements between public authorities and the airport."
  
Its successive operators have received millions of euros in public
subsidies - including from the owner of the airfield, the
Languedoc-Roussillon region - to finance infrastructure projects,
among other things.
  
"At this stage, the commission has doubts whether the measures
comply with ... EU guidelines on state aid in the aviation
sector," it said in a statement.
  
It particularly intends to check if the subsidies granted to the
airport's first operator, the local Chamber of Commerce, were
"necessary to carry out the investment" and "proportionate to the
objectives pursued."

DPA FINANCE Belgium aviation  Brussels Airlines downplays emigration threat over Ryanair rivalry Brussels   
The leading Belgian carrier Brussels Airlines on
Thursday denied that it was poised to leave the country, saying that
it had only raised the possibility to draw attention to unfair
competition by low-cost carrier Ryanair.
  
"I do not want to relocate aircrews," the chairman of the
airline's board of directors, Etienne Davignon, told broadcaster RTL.
  
The company had previously complained that Ryanair had an unfair
advantage by operating in Belgium, but paying lower taxes and pension
contributions in Ireland, where its headquarters are located.
  
Chief executive Bernard Gustin has demanded fiscal benefits from
the Belgian government to offset the advantage, according to local
media. He reportedly threatened that Brussels Airlines would
otherwise move headquarters to the likes of Luxembourg or Ireland.
  
Government sources told the Belga news agency that it would be
"unimaginable" to give in to such demands given the austerity
measures Belgium has recently had to implement.
  
The airline on Thursday received at least one offer for a new home
away from its namesake capital.
  
Brussels Airlines is welcome to relocate to Charleroi - the
Belgian airport some 65 kilometres south of Brussels that is the base
for Ryanair flights, the minister responsible for airport policies in
the region told broadcaster Bel-RTL.
  
The move would save the airline 29 euros per passenger, Andre
Antoine claimed.

DPA x EU justice Alitalia Ryanair  EU court rejects Ryanair appeal against 2008 rescue of Alitalia 
Luxembourg   
The European Union's top court on Wednesday
rejected an appeal by low-cost airline Ryanair against European
Commission decisions on the 2008 state rescue and privatization of
Italy's main carrier Alitalia.
  
Back then, the EU executive declared a 300-million-euro
(400-million-dollar) bridge loan from the Italian state "illegal,"
but cleared the transformation of Alitalia into a bad company and the
sale of its marketable assets to Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI).
  
"The court dismisses Ryanair's action and thus confirms the
commission's decisions," the General Court of the EU said in a
statement.
  
Ryanair had argued that the commission should have forced CAI,
rather than Alitalia, to pay back the money to the Italian state, but
the Luxembourg-based body disagreed.
  
This was because Ryanair "has not demonstrated that the fact of
ordering recovery of the aid from Alitalia (and not from CAI)
substantially affected its competitive position," EU judges said.
  
They also rejected Ryanair's claims that the Italian government
sold the Alitalia business to CAI at below-market price and that the
commission had failed to spot the problem.
  
"All measures had been taken to ensure that the sale took place at
a price not lower than the market price," the EU court said.

DPA FINANCE EU justice transport Iceland Ryanair  Ryanair should pay for Icelandic volcano disruption, EU 
lawyer says Luxembourg   
Low cost Irish carrier Ryanair must compensate
passengers left stranded by a volcanic eruption in Iceland, despite
the fact that such a natural event was beyond its control, a top
European Union lawyer concluded on Thursday.
  
European air traffic was halted for about a week in April 2010,
after ash spewing from a volcano erupting under the Eyjafjallajokull
glacier spread around the continent, prompting fears that it might
damage jet engines.
  
Ryanair is fighting a 1,130-euro (1,500-dollar) compensation claim
for food, accommodation and transport costs incurred by an Irish
passenger who had her flight from Faro in Portugal to Dublin
cancelled on April 17 and was only able to return home a week later.
  
But a lawyer for the EU Court of Justice - whom Irish judges
handling the case turned to for an opinion - said EU regulations
force airlines to look after their passengers even when flight
cancellations are due to "extraordinary circumstances."
  
There is "no room for a separate category of 'particularly
extraordinary' events which would fully release the air carrier from
its obligation," Advocate General Yves Bot found, according to an EU
court statement.
  
Airlines should, however, be spared from having to pay passengers
extra damages when they are not directly responsible for flight
cancellations or delays, Bot confirmed.
  
Advocate generals give a preliminary, non-binding opinion on cases
handled by the EU court. The Luxembourg-based body generally follows
their advice in its final rulings.
Ryanair should pay for Icelandic volcano disruption, EU lawyer says
  
After the Iceland volcano crisis, Ryanair denounced the EU
passenger rights rules as unfair. In April 2011, it introduced a
2-euro levy on all its flights to cover the cost of compensations
that it has been forced to pay as a result of the regulation.
  
Bot made a direct reference to that decision, noting that carriers
"are free to pass on the resulting costs (of EU regulation) to
airline ticket prices."

DPA FINANCE Ireland aviation business  LEAD: Ryanair profits rise despite fuel costs and economic downturn 
London   
A sharp rise in pre-tax profits Monday boosted the
confidence of low-cost airline Ryanair to sail through the economic
downturn and raise profit expectations for the full year.
  
The Irish budget airline Monday reported a rise of 23 per
cent in pre-tax profits to 463 million euros (637 million
dollars) between July and September, 2011.
  
For the last six months, pre-tax profit stood at 544 million
euros. Ryanair said the increase meant that the expected full-year
results could be by 10 per cent higher than forecast, rising to an
estimated 440 million euros.
  
Ryanair said the results were due to a 24-per cent rise in
revenues to 2.7 billion euros as passenger number rose by 12 per cent
to 44.7 million over the past six months.
  
The airline said it had held average fare rises to 13 per cent as
fuel costs rose by 37 per cent, while its competitors responded to
rising fuel bills with a hike in ticket prices.
  
"We have been expanding rapidly for 20 years now, there [is] more
and more demand for Ryanair services across Europe," Ryanair chief
executive Michael O'Leary said, underlining that the profit rise was
achieved "despite the economic downturn."
  
Ryanair's Chief Financial Officer, Howard Millar, said: "So far we
have not seen any impact from recession."
  
However, Ryanair expects passenger numbers to drop in November as
it carries through its plan to ground up to 80 aircraft out of a
fleet of 272 over the winter months in response to high fuel costs.

DPA FINANCE EU justice transport  EU court rules against Air France over air passengers' rights Luxembourg   
Airline compensation costs for flight
cancellations may get heftier as a result of a ruling handed down
Thursday by the Court of Justice of the European Union, in a case
involving Air France.
  
Under EU law, passengers are entitled to receive between 125 and
600 euros (172-825 dollars) when their flight is cancelled. But they
should also be looked after during the delay, with access to free
accommodation, meals and a telephone.
  
If an airline "fails to fulfil its obligations" under the
legislation, passengers are entitled to ask for extra damages on top
of the regular flight cancellation fees, EU judges said.
  
Their ruling - which followed the legal advice of a court top
lawyer in July - referred to a case involving seven Spaniards suing
Air France before a Spanish court.
  
They are demanding compensation for taxi fares and meal costs, as
well as non-material damages, after their flight from Paris to the
north-eastern Spanish city of Vigo was cancelled in September 2008.
  
Spanish judges will now be tasked with delivering a final
judgement on the case, taking into account the ruling of the EU
court.
  
Airlines argue that EU rules on air passengers' rights are too
onerous. Their complaints grew louder after massive flight
disruptions, provoked by the eruption of a volcano in Iceland last
year, caused a spike in compensation claims.
  
Following that incident, low-cost airline Ryanair started charging
passengers two extra euros extra per ticket, claiming this was
EU court rules against Air France over air passengers' rights
necessary to cover the costs of EU regulation.

Luxembourg   
The European Union's executive was wrong to
ignore a complaint by low-cost airline Ryanair against aid given to
former Italian state carrier Alitalia, the bloc's Court of Justice
ruled on Thursday.
  
The European Commission declined to take action despite being
alerted to government decisions which allowed struggling Alitalia to
offload 100 employees and benefit from tax breaks and compensation
for lost business following the September 11, 2001 attacks.
  
The EU executive, which is the bloc's highest antitrust watchdog,
"has failed in its obligations," EU judges said in a statement.
  
The commission should now take up the case "within a reasonable
amount of time," the Luxembourg-based court explained.
  
Parallel complaints from Ryanair about alleged restrictions it
faced on its activities in Italy and further state aid to Alitalia to
help it pay for fuel, airport charges and redundancy programmes were
thrown out.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair reported a hefty
increase in revenues for its fiscal first quarter ending June,
reporting a 29-per-cent year-on-year increase to nearly 1.2 billion
euros.
  
Despite rising fuel costs, earnings rose 49 per cent to 139
million euros.
  
While the flight ban due to volcanic activity on Iceland severely
affected Ryanair last year, the new ash cloud in May 2011 scarcely
made a dent on the company's earnings.
  
The company said it was expecting 400 million euros in earnings
for the entire year ending 2012.

DPA FINANCE EU business aviation  EU probes aid to French, German airports used by low cost airlines 
Brussels   
State aid given to German and French airports
used by low-cost airlines such as Ryanair is to be subjected to
"in-depth investigations," the European Union's executive said
Wednesday.
  
While state aid is generally outlawed in the EU, it is allowed for
smaller airports in order to boost the economy of less developed
regions. Ryanair and other carriers have made ample use of that
provision.
  
Marseille airport received a 7.6-million-euro
(10.7-million-dollar) grant between 2005 and 2007 to build the mp2
terminal for low-cost carriers.
  
The European Commission which, as the EU's executive, polices
state aid regulations, said it had "doubts whether the subsidy was
necessary" and "whether the aid was proportionate."
  
In addition, it intends to check whether lower fees offered to
budget airlines using the mp2 facilities, and to those starting new
routes, are appropriate - as well as whether an advertisement deal
granted to a Ryanair subsidiary is overpriced.
  
Favourable credit extended by German authorities to Frankfurt-Hahn
airport is also set to be scrutinized. The commission said it took
"the preliminary view that these measures merely contribute to pay
the operating costs of the airport," breaching EU state aid rules.
  
The EU executive also said it would investigate whether a tax that
Ireland charged air passengers between 2009 and 2011 unduly favoured
Irish airlines because it imposed a lower duty on short-haul flights.

Since March 1, a flat fee of 3 euros applies for all departures
from Irish airports.
  
At the same time, the commission cleared an air passenger tax that
was in place in the Netherlands in 2008-2009. Under the scheme,
passengers were charged 11.25 euros for flights within the EU and
shorter than 3,500 kilometers, and 40 euros for all other
destinations.

Luxembourg   
Airlines' compensation costs for flight
cancellations may get heftier as a result of an opinion delivered
Tuesday by a top lawyer in the European Union Court of Justice, in a
case involving Air France.
  
Under EU law, passengers are entitled to receive between 125 and
600 euros (178-857 dollars) when their flight is cancelled. But they
should also be looked after during the delay, with access to free
accommodation, meals and a telephone.
  
Advocate General Eleanor Sharpton said that if that "adequate
care" is missing, passengers may sue for extra damages on top of the
regular flight cancellation fees.
  
She was referring to a case involving Spaniards who are asking Air
France to refund taxi fares and meal costs and pay non-material
damaged to them after their flight from Paris to Vigo was cancelled
in September 2008.
  
The full EU court still has to rule on the case, but judges in
Luxembourg usually follow the advice of their Advocate General.
  
Airlines have complained that EU air passengers' rights regulation
places a too onerous burden on them - especially after flight
disruptions caused last year by the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull
volcano in Iceland caused a spike in compensation claims.
  
Following that incident, the EU's executive, the European
Commission, has started a review of the regulation, while low-cost
airline Ryanair started charging passengers two euros extra per

Eds: updates with airport openings, carriers   =
  
Reykjavik/Stockholm (dpa) - The ash cloud from an erupting
Icelandic volcano forced the temporary closure of airports in Germany
and Sweden on Wednesday, resulting in flight cancellations.
  
In Germany, Bremen airport reopened after being closed for most of
Wednesday morning. Hamburg was due to reopen at midday (1000 GMT) and
the airspace over Berlin was expected to reopen at 2pm (1200 GMT).
  
  
Earlier, Germany's largest carrier Lufthansa anticipated around
150 flight cancellations, affecting Hamburg, Bremen and Berlin
airports as well as northbound flights from Stuttgart, a spokesman
said. The airline operates around 2,000 flights daily.

Reykjavik/Stockholm (dpa) - The ash cloud from an erupting
Icelandic volcano forced the temporary closure of airports in Germany
and Sweden on Wednesday, resulting in flight cancellations.
  
  In Germany, Bremen airport reopened after being closed for most of
Wednesday morning. Hamburg was due to reopen at midday (1000 GMT) and
the airspace over Berlin was expected to reopen at 2pm (1200 GMT).
  
  
Earlier, Germany's largest carrier Lufthansa anticipated around
150 flight cancellations, affecting Hamburg, Bremen and Berlin
airports as well as northbound flights from Stuttgart, a spokesman
said. The airline operates around 2,000 flights daily.
  
Other carriers that cancelled flights bound for or departing from
affected German airports included British Airways, as well as budget
carriers easyJet and Ryanair.
  
German air traffic control said the concentration of airborne ash
was no longer critical.

Reykjavik/Stockholm (dpa) - Airports in northern Germany and
Sweden reopened as the ash cloud drifting over European airspace from
an erupting Icelandic volcano diminished Wednesday.
  
The Brussels-based association of European air traffic
controllers, Eurocontrol, said about 450 flights were cancelled in
German airspace due to the ash cloud.
  
Projections from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) in London
suggested the ash cloud would dissipate overnight, and Eurocontrol
said it did not expect "any significant impact on European airspace"
Thursday.
  
The Grimsvotn volcano has "calmed down considerably," but the
tremors have not completely ceased, geophysicist Gunnar Gudmundsson
of the Icelandic Meteorological Office said.
  
After a burst early Wednesday, the plume had settled at a few
hundred metres and the volcano was mainly producing vapour, he told
the German Press Agency dpa.
  
The ash cloud that has caused disruptions in European airspace in
recent days originated from the volcano's initial eruptions at the
weekend, Gudmundsson said.
  
When it erupted Saturday, Iceland's most active volcano created a
plume about 20 kilometres high. By Monday it was between 8 to 10
kilometres in height. That had decreased on Tuesday to 3 to 5
kilometres.
  
Berlin's two airports, which normally handle 700 takeoffs and
landings daily, said 185 were cancelled because of a three-hour
closure. Hamburg Airport in northern Germany said 231 flights were
cancelled because of the six-hour closure.
  
ROUNDUP: German airports reopen as ash cloud diminishes
The cancellations impacted Germany's largest carrier, Lufthansa,
and other carriers bound for or departing from affected German
airports including British Airways, as well as budget carriers
easyJet and Ryanair.
  
On Tuesday, the ash cloud resulted in the cancellation of some 500
flights in Europe, mainly in British airspace. British air traffic
control company Nats said skies over Britain would be clear of high
levels of ash by at least 7 pm (1800 GMT).
  
Passengers were advised to regularly check websites operated by
airlines, travel operators or airports from which they were leaving.
  
In Sweden, some 20 flights were cancelled at Landvetter airport,
the main airport in western Sweden.
  
In Iceland, roads south of the erupting volcano were reopened
Tuesday as the ashfall subsided. Prime Minister Johanna
Sigurdardottir said "the worst is over, and now the clean-up can
begin" after visiting the worst-hit area where about 1,000 people
live.

Reykjavik/Stockholm (dpa) -  Airports in northern Germany and
Sweden reopened as the ash cloud drifting over European airspace from
an erupting Icelandic volcano diminished Wednesday.
  
After closing temporarily earlier in the day, airports in the
German cities of Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin reopened by mid-afternoon
as the concentration of airborne ash was no longer deemed critical.
  
The Grimsvotn volcano has "calmed down considerably," but the
  
tremors have not completely ceased, geophysicist Gunnar Gudmundsson

Berlin's Tegel airport said air movements resumed after a
three-hour closure while the ash plume drifted over the German
capital and on towards Poland. A Delta Airlines plane bound for New
York was the first jetliner to head up the runway.
  
At the northern city of Hamburg, a six-hour closure ended when a
TUIfly plane from Heraklion, Greece landed.

Iceland's most-active volcano,
Grimsvotn, continued to erupt Tuesday, spewing ash into the
atmosphere, resulting in some 250 flight cancellations in Europe.
  
  The Brussels-based association of European air traffic controllers,
Eurocontrol, said 252 flights were cancelled due to the Icelandic
volcanic ash cloud.
  
British Airways, KLM, Aer Lingus, EasyJet and Ryanair were among
airlines that cancelled flights from all Scottish airports to
destinations within Britain and abroad.
  
As the ash cloud drifted towards Scandinavia, flights from
Stavanger and Haugesund in western Norway were halted at 0600 GMT
Tuesday morning, Norwegian aviation authority Avinor said.
  
Weather and atmospheric conditions at the Grimsvotn volcano made
it difficult to estimate the plume height, but radar images suggested
"the plume was not rising as high" as previously, Teitur Arason at
the Icelandic Meteorological Office told the German Press Agency dpa.
  
The readings indicated the plume was between 5 and 7 kilometres,
he said, but snow fall and cloud cover made estimates problematic.
  
Conditions were expected to improve later in the day allowing a
spotter plane to fly over the area. When Grimsvotn erupted Saturday
it created a plume about 20 kilometres high. By Monday it was between
8 to 10 kilometres.
  
Iceland late Monday reopened all its international airports,

Ash continued to fall in Iceland, affecting farms and communities
south of the volcano and in combination with strong winds created an
"ash blizzard" with very poor visibility, Arason said.

Budget airline Ryanair Monday predicted a rise in
air fares to compensate for higher fuel prices as it announced a
26-per-cent rise in profits for the last financial year.
  
The airline said profits reached 319 million euros (449 million
dollars) in the year to March 31, as passenger numbers rose by 8 per

to 1.2 billion euros, according to the results.
  
During the reporting period, 14,000 flights were cancelled due to
adverse weather conditions and the widespread disruption of European
air traffic because of the Icelandic volcanic eruption in April 2010.
  
The Irish carrier, which has a fleet of 272 planes, expects
traffic to grow by a further 4 per cent to 75 million passengers in
the year ending March 2012.
  
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary predicted that more
airlines would "go broke" due to higher oil prices in 2011. He
expected no growth for Ryanair in the second half of the new

In view of an anticipated drop in passenger numbers in the winter
months, the airline would ground about 80 planes during the second
half of the financial year, including 50 new jets due to be delivered
by Boeing.
  
"The aim is to lose less money in the winter months," said
O'Leary. However, new "growth opportunities" would be created as more
airlines would fold.

traffic to grow by a further 4 per cent to 75 million passengers in
the year ending March 2012.
  
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary predicted that more
airlines would "go broke" due to higher oil prices in 2011. He
expected no growth for Ryanair in the second half of the new
financial year.
  
In view of an anticipated drop in passenger numbers in the winter
months, the airline would ground about 80 planes during the second
half of the financial year, including 50 new jets due to be delivered
by Boeing.
  
"The aim is to lose less money in the winter months," said
O'Leary. However, new "growth opportunities" would be created as more
airlines would fold.
  
"Higher oil prices will force competitors to continue to increase
fares and fuel surcharges which makes Ryanair's lower fares even more
ROUNDUP: Ryanair warns of fares hike as profits surge
attractive," he said.

DPA POLITICS Ireland business aviation  Ryanair profits surge as fare rises on the way London   
Irish budget carrier Ryanair Monday reported a
rise in pre-tax profits of 26 per cent in the last financial year,
but warned of further fare hikes due to increasing fuel costs.
  
The airline said profits reached 319 million euros (449 million
dollars) in the year to March 31. But Europe's biggest budget
carrier warned that more airlines would "go broke" due to higher oil
prices.
  
While this prospect brought further growth opportunities for
Ryanair, the airline said it expected to increase fares by about 12
per cent in the current financial year, following a similar rise
last year.

DPA FINANCE Spain Transport Aviation Ireland  Ryanair threatens Spain with job cuts unless fines are 
lifted Madrid   
Irish budget airline Ryanair has threatened to
reduce operations and cut jobs in Spain unless the authorities lift
fines worth 1.23 million euros, the Spanish dailies Expansion and El
Mundo reported Monday.
  
Spanish officials confirmed that the government had received a
letter from Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary to that effect.
  
Ryanair had been hit with 65 fines in 2009 and 2010, the reports
said.
  
The fines were related to problems such as the airline refusing to
accept identity cards and driving licences as identity documents,
not granting promised discounts to passengers travelling to their
homes in the Canary or Balearic Islands, and disagreements over
luggage, according to sources at the Infrastructure Ministry.
  
O'Leary described the fines as "unfair and unjust" in a letter
addressed to Spanish Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian.
  
Sources at the ministry confirmed that the letter, published by
the economic daily Expansion, had arrived in January.
  
No effort was made "by the relevant agencies to verify the facts
of these cases or take account of Ryanair's defence," O'Leary wrote.
  
He described the fines as "disproportionate" and "discriminatory,"
saying other airlines in Spain were not subject to such high fines.
  
If the fines were not lifted, Ryanair would "begin the process of
cutting flights, routes, traffic and jobs at Spanish airports," the
letter read.
Ryanair threatens Spain with job cuts unless fines are lifted
  
Ryanair expects to transport more than 30 million passengers to
and from Spain this year, more than the country's leading airline
Iberia, by Ryanair's own account. The carrier says it sustains more
than 33,000 jobs at Spanish airports.
  
O'Leary requested a meeting with Sebastian, which has not taken
place.
  
The affair has been passed from the Industry to the Infrastructure
Ministry, which said the procedure of imposing fines was "following
its normal course."
  
Spanish consumers' organizations accused Ryanair of "blackmail"
and threatened to take legal action if "even a single fine" was
cancelled.

Budget airline Ryanair reported a net loss of 8.5

which it said Monday was caused mainly by disruption due to extreme
winter weather in December.
  
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the "small
third-quarter loss" was "disappointing," but the airline was on track
to break even for the full financial year, which ends on March 31.
  
The Irish airline said it faced a rise of 37 per cent in its
third-quarter fuel bill. Passenger numbers increased by 6 per cent.

The European Union's executive has blocked a
planned merger between Greek airlines Aegean and Olympic because it
would create a "quasi-monopoly," officials in Brussels said
Wednesday.
  
The EU has strict rules on maintaining and boosting competition,
and the European Commission is tasked with making sure member states
stick to them.
  
The commission "has prohibited ... the proposed merger between
Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air, as it would have resulted in a
quasi-monopoly on the Greek air transport market," a statement issued
in Brussels read.
  
Between them, the two airlines control over 90 per cent of the
Greek domestic air market. Commission investigators have concluded
that there were "no realistic prospects" of sizeable rivals entering
the market, the statement said.
  
"This would have led to higher fares for four out of six million
Greek and European consumers travelling on routes to and from Athens
each year."
  
To win the commission's approval, the two airlines offered to give
up a number of slots at Athens and other Greek airports. However, the
commission decided that that would not be enough to solve the
problem, because there was not enough demand for slots from other
airlines.
  
It is only the second time in history that the commission has
blocked an airline merger. The first case was in 2007, when the
executive blocked Ryanair's takeover of local rival Aer Lingus.

DPA FINANCE Germany Aviation  Ryanair slashes German timetable in reaction to tax    Dusseldorf, Germany   
Irish-based Ryanair radically pruned
back its timetables serving Germany on Tuesday in response to a new
departure tax from German airports set to go into effect on January
1.
  
The airline, Europe's dominant budget airline, said it would move
some of its aircraft fleet away from Germany to neighbouring nations
which do not impose such a tax.
  
More than half the Ryanair flights serving Berlin will vanish in
the new timetable, a spokesman said in Dusseldorf.
  
In October, the airline cut its services to the Frankfurt area. It
said it would now trim services to the Dusseldorf area by 20 per
cent. The budget carrier, which often uses small, country airports to
save landing charges, mainly flies short-haul routes within Europe.
  
In a statement, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary charged
that Germany was damaging itself by introducing the tax. He said
experience in Britain and Ireland was that such taxes significantly
reduced tourist arrivals.
  
The cuts to 34 routes connecting to Germany would mean 3 million
fewer passengers carried, the airline said. Ryanair's 2010-11
full-year business target is to carry 73.5 million passengers.
  
Germany is to charge a departure tax of 8 euros (10.50 dollars)
per person per flight from January 1 for European destinations.
Long-distance flights will be subject to taxes of 25 and 45 euros.

DPA FINANCE Malta Transport EU  EU temporarily authorises rescue aid for Air Malta Valletta, Malta   
The European Commission said on Monday it
had authorised a loan facility for Air Malta to prevent the collapse
of the national airline of the EU's smallest state.
  
The approval of state support to Air Malta is only temporary to
avoid a "sudden disappearance of the airline" which would lead to
serious disturbances in the Maltese economy, said Joaquín Almunia,
Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy.
  
Almunia added that he had also taken into account the very limited
impact the measure will have on other member states.
  
The loan, worth 52 million euros (70 million dollars), is in line
with EU state aid rules, because it is limited in time and scope.
  
The Commission said it approved the measure temporarily, until it
can take a position on the restructuring plan to be submitted by
Malta within a maximum of six months.
  
Speaking in parliament on Monday, Maltese Finance Minister Tonio
Fenech described the situation as serious.
  
The Maltese economy relies heavily on tourism and the share of
tourists carried by Air Malta exceeds more than half the total
passengers.
  
Malta's government and trade unions have agreed to set up a
steering committee to oversee the restructuring of Air Malta.
  
Valletta has not yet divulged its reform plans though early
retirement schemes are expected. Some media reports say more than
half the workforce is expected to be shed.
  
EU temporarily authorises rescue aid for Air Malta
Air Malta suffered losses of 31 million dollars in 2009 and the
deficit this year is expected to be higher.
  
Ironically, Air Malta's dip is taking place as the island-state

cost airlines like Ryanair.

DPA FINANCE Malta Transport  Malta in concerted bid to keep national airline flying Valletta, Malta   
Malta's government and trade unions agreed
Tuesday to set up a steering committee to oversee the restructuring
of Air Malta, as the national airline's future hangs in the balance.
  
The government of the EU's smallest state has notified the
European Commission of its aim to grant Air Malta urgent rescue aid
tied to a massive restructuring programme. Valletta has not yet
outlined its reform blueprint, though early retirement schemes are
expected.
  
Air Malta suffered losses of 31 million dollars in 2009 and
airline sources told the German Press Agency dpa the deficit this
year is expected to be "much higher."
  
Ironically, Air Malta's dip is taking place as the island-state
heads towards a record year for tourism thanks to the arrival of low-
cost airlines like Ryanair.
  
The restructuring plan could be one of the most delicate steered
by the Maltese government.
  
In an island almost entirely dependent on air travel for its
tourism, Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi described Air Malta as "a
lifeline" and insisted it was strategically important for Malta to
have an airline it could control.
  
The airline still carries 60 per cent of tourists visiting Malta
and tourism operators have warned about the danger of relying on
budget operators who may quit operations without warning.
  
Malta Tourism Authority chief Josef Formosa Gauci said that on
many occasions, Air Malta has been obliged to take certain decisions
that may not have been commercially viable but which have made a huge
Malta in concerted bid to keep national airline flying
difference to country's sustainability. Tourism is still the main
contributor to Malta's GDP.
  
But others said Air Malta's woes were also self-inflicted.
  
Green Party chairman Michael Briguglio said on Wednesday the
national airline had been used by successive governments as an
electoral tool to employ people "for reasons that have nothing to do
with economic viability."

Eds: more figures, clarifies adjusted results   =
  
Dublin (dpa) - Discount air carrier Ryanair reported Monday
double-digit profits and revenues growth in the first half of the
fiscal year amid rising passenger numbers and ticket prices.
  
The company said net earnings in the April-September period came
to 452 million euros (600 million dollars), up 17 per cent, while
revenues rose 23 per cent to 2.2 billion euros.
  
After charges set aside for the ash crisis after the volcano
eruption on Iceland last spring, the half-year adjusted profits came
to 424 million euros, Ryanair said.
  
Earnings and revenues were given a boost as average ticket prices
increased 12 per cent in the year-on-year period, and passenger
numbers gained 10 per cent to 40.1 million.
  
The carrier's results also benefited from a 22 per cent rise in
other revenues such as from baggage fees, priority boarding and
onboard drinks.
  
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline was
cautious about its outlook for the rest of the year, but that
overall, the figures should be higher than previously projected.
  
"Our outlook for the fiscal year remains cautious as we have
little visibility on fourth-quarter yields," he said.
  
But the airline is now projecting second-half earnings of 380 to
400 million euros, as against earlier predictions of 350-375 million
euros.
  
Ryanair said that the costs from the disruptions resulting from
the volcanic ash crisis last spring was not as high as initially

feared. The airline said the bill came to 32 million euros, compared
with earlier estimates of 50 million euros.
  
O'Leary praised Ryanair's first-half results as being a "testimony
to the robustness" of the airline.

DPA POLITICS US Terrorism Britain  Britain announces tighter controls on air freight London   
Britain on Monday announced a ban on flights
containing unaccompanied freight from Somalia as part of tighter
restrictions designed to prevent terrorist attacks.
  
The ban, which comes into force at midnight, follows a similar
embargo against air freight from Yemen imposed after bombs were found
in air cargo that originated in that country.
  
The government also announced that toner cartridges weighing more
than 500 grams will be banned from hand baggage on flights departing
from Britain and also on cargo flights unless they originate from a
regular shipper with security clearance.
  
Home Secretary Theresa May told parliament the two bombs
identified in last week's plot originated in Yemen, but said
suspending freight flights from Somalia was necessary because of a
possible link between terrorists in the two countries.
  
Earlier, Prime Minister David Cameron told legislators Britain
must take every possible step to "cut out the terrorist cancer" that
exists in the Arabian Peninsula.
  
May said an "intensive investigation"' had been taking place in
Britain and overseas following the discovery on Friday of an
explosive device on a UPS flight at East Midlands Airport and a
similar bomb on a FedEx plane in Dubai.
  
The terrorists, she said, were constantly looking for ways to
circumvent security procedures.
  
The new measures drew a mixed response from airline operators.
  
Michael O'Leary, board chairman of no frills carrier Ryanair, said
Britain announces tighter controls on air freight
common sense should prevail, and pointed out that passengers who fly
on his planes do not carry toner cartridges.
  
Mike Carrivick, chief executive of BAR UK, which represents more
than 80 British airlines, promised the government his organization's
full support.

eruption on Iceland last spring.
  
   The company said net earnings in the April-September period came
to 452 million euros (600 million dollars), amid revenues of 2.2
billion euros, up 23 per cent from a year earlier.
  
   After the first-half performance, Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary
predicted higher profits in the second half of the year than
previously projected.
  
   The company now sees adjusted second-half earnings of 380 to 400
million euros, compared with Ryanair's previous projection of 350-375
million euros, with Ryanair citing higher ticket prices as a factor.

Ryanair flew its last plane out of the Hungarian
capital on Friday and cancelled all further flights, the budget
airline announced.
  
The Irish no frills carrier had warned earlier that it would pull
out in October unless the operator of Budapest's international
airport agreed to reduce the fees its charges airlines.
  
"It would be worthwhile for Budapest Airport to follow the example
of Belgian, Spanish and Italian airports ... in lowering its prices,"
the airline's Hungarian sales manager, Tamas Laszlo, said.
  
Laszlo also noted that competing airports in Central Europe had
also discounted their fees recently, the state news agency MTI
reported.
  
Ryanair is the world's largest international airline in terms of
passengers carried, over 65 million last year according to figures
from the International Air Transport Association (AITA).

DPA FINANCE Germany Politics Economy  German parliament approves spending cuts  
Berlin (dpa) - The German parliament on Thursday passed a bill
encompassing 20 billion euros of spending cuts by the year 2014, as
part of a broader savings programme endorsed by Chancellor Angela
Merkel despite the country's recent economic upturn.
  
The measures, which come into effect on January 1, 2011, affect
welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed and reduce child
benefits, as well as introducing a new departure tax for air
passengers.
  
In total, Merkel's centre-right coalition of the Christian Union
(CDU/CSU) and Free Democrats (FDP) plans to save 80 billion euros of
public spending in the next four years.
  
Thursday's bill affects those measures requiring separate
legislative approval outside of the regular budget process.
  
The proposals have been criticized by opposition parties and
welfare groups for disproportionately affecting the socially
vulnerable, whilst having little impact on industry or top earners.
  
Budget airline Ryanair has also announced plans to reduce flights
to Frankfurt as a result of the measures, arguing that the new
departure tax affects profit margins. German airlines have also
expressed concern.
  
In recent months the German economy has rebounded from the global
economic crisis, with the 2010 economic growth forecast doubling to
3.4 per cent.
  
Nevertheless, Merkel insisted in a speech to parliament on
Wednesday that the spending cuts remained crucial for a healthy
economy.
  
"With a growth rate of more than 3 per cent this year, now is the
German parliament approves spending cuts
time to begin to consolidation," the chancellor said.

early Brussels   
Belgian air traffic was slowly returning to
normal on Wednesday, as a wildcat strike by air traffic controllers
ended earlier than planned, officials said.
  
The national air traffic control company, Belgocontrol, had said
Tuesday the unannounced industrial action would force it to shut off
air space until Wednesday 1200 GMT.
  
But on Wednesday the company said on its website that after a
meeting late Tuesday between trade union representatives and the
management, the strike was "suspended," allowing air space to be
reopened as of Tuesday 2000 GMT.
  
That, however, still left airlines dealing with a backlog of
cancelled flights. A spokesman for Brussels Airport - the biggest in
the country - said 44 per cent of scheduled departures had been
cancelled on that day.
  
Paul De Backer told the Belga news agency that on Wednesday the
percentage of flights cancelled due to the industrial action at
Belgocontrol was set to fall to 20 per cent. A further 2 per cent, he
added, was set to be grounded because of a general strike in Spain.
  
Disruptions were also expected in Charleroi airport, where Irish
carrier Ryanair and other low cost airlines operate from.
  
Officials said air traffic was set to resume fully only later on
Wednesday.

   Brussels (dpa) - Belgium's airports closed down on Tuesday as air
traffic controllers declared a 24-hour wildcat strike.
  
A statement from the Belgian air traffic control company,
Belgocontrol, said an "unofficial action" from its workers had forced
it to close the Belgian civil airspace until Wednesday 1200 GMT.
  
The industrial protest grounded planes in Brussels and Charleroi,
with companies such as Brussels Airlines, Ryanair and Wizz cancelling
all of their flights.
  
Two other low-cost companies normally operating from Charleroi,
Jetairfly and Air Arabia, diverted their operations to Lille in
France, the airport's website indicated.
  
"Belgocontrol sincerely regrets the current action, penalising the
passengers, the airline companies and the airports," the company
indicated.
  
It said it would resume talks with its workers as soon as trade
union representatives came forward with a "formal list of demands,
transmitted in accordance with trade union status regulations."
  
The secretary of the Confederation of Christian Trade Unions
(ACV/CSC), Bernadette Guillemeyn, told the Belga news agency that air
traffic controllers were striking out of a general sense of malaise
within Belgocontrol.
  
Belgium's deputy transport minister, Etienne Schouppe, condemned
the workers' protest, saying she could "not understand this wild
action."

Belgium's air traffic was brought to almost a

Brussels Airport - the country's largest - indicated on its

on Tuesday.
  
"It is not clear at the moment how long (this) situation will

Charleroi's Brussels South Airport - starting point for most low

and/or flight cancellations."
  
Two companies using the airport - Ryanair and Wizz - cancelled all
flights for the day, while Jetairfly and Air Arabia diverted them to
Lille airport in France, the Brussels South website indicated.
  
The Belga news agency also reported that in Belgium's smaller
airports all departures had been cancelled in Liege and Ostende,
while planes were still taking off from Antwerp, albeit with delays
linked to the industrial action.

DPA FINANCE Germany Business Aviation  Ryanair: Germany routes may be closed because of new departure tax 
Berlin   
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, may close
some of its routes in Germany because of a new departure tax being
introduced by the Berlin government, company officials said Thursday.
  
"We will have to review all of our routes, and it is likely that
these taxes will lead to a decline in passenger numbers," Ryanair
spokesman Stephen McNamara told the German Press Agency dpa.
  
On Wednesday, the German government had signed off on 20 billion
euros (25.6 billion dollars) in budget cuts and tax increases aimed
at slashing its deficit. A major component is a new airport departure
tax of up to 45 euros on each passenger from January 1, which is
expected to raise 1 billion euros a year.
  
Ryanair spokeswoman Henrike Schmidt told dpa-AFX that the review
could then "lead to route closures."
  
Ryanair operates 174 routes to European and North African
destinations from its three German hubs in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and
Bremen. The airline carries some 11 million passengers a year from
Germany.
  
Ryanair has appealed to the German parliament, which must approve
the cabinet's budget measures, to "prevent this mad flight tax."
  
"These are self-defeating taxes, they lead to a reduction in
tourism numbers and a loss of jobs," McNamara said.
  
The government has presented the levy as a form of "green"
taxation, aimed at reducing heavy carbon-emitting travel patterns
while raising revenue.
  
Ryanair : Germany routes may be closed because of new departure tax
Ryanair said it intends to lobby the German parliament through the
European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA).
  
ELFAA has claimed that the new tax will lead to 10,000 job losses.

Shanghai landmark returns
  
Shanghai (dpa) - One of China's most iconic hotels, the Fairmont
Peace Hotel in Shanghai, has reopened after comprehensive renovation.
Work on revitalizing the hotel, which occupies a prime location on
the Bund overlooking the Huangpu River, took three years to complete.
The owners say architects have managed to retain the art deco
character and flourishes of the legendary hostelry built in 1929. At
the same, modern features such as a spa have been added. A new
penthouse suite on the tenth floor occupies rooms where the hotel's
creator, Sir Victor Sassoon, once lived. Room prices start at around
385 dollars with an additional 15 per cent service charge.
  
Ryanair reduces baggage fee
  
Dublin (dpa) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is reducing a
check-in baggage fee which was temporarily raised during the summer
to coincide with school holidays in Britain and Ireland. From
September 1 passengers will again pay 15 euros (around 19 dollars)
instead of 20 euros (around 25 dollars) for each item of checked-in
luggage provided it does not weigh more than 15 kilograms. For items
weighing over 20 kg the charge is 25 euros. The higher summer fee
of 20 euros per luggage item remains in force on routes to the Canary
Islands, since these are the flights with the highest fuel
consumption, said Ryanair spokeswoman Henrike Schmidt.

   Bangkok   
Thai Airways International (THAI) on Monday
announced the launch of a new low-cost airline, Thai Tiger,
targeting mainly the South-East Asian market.
  
   THAI and Singapore's Tiger Airways signed an agreement to jointly
invest in and manage the carrier to be based in Bangkok. Operations
would begin in the first quarter of 2011, executives said.
  
   Thai Tiger would offer short-haul services within a five-hour
radius of Suvarnabhumi International Airport. The venture is part of
THAI's strategy to capture more of the regional budget travel market,
company president Piyasvasti Amranand said.
  
   "When low-cost airlines started out in this region, they had only
2 per cent of the aviation market, but now they claim 17 per cent,"
Piyasvasti said. "We don't want to keep losing market share."
  
   THAI controlled 42 per cent of the regional market seven years
ago, but now only has 33 per cent, Piyasvasti claimed.
  
   Malaysia-based low-cost carrier AirAsia has been a regional
success story over the past decade, drawing business away from
established national carriers such as THAI, Malaysia Airlines and
Singapore Airlines.
  
   Singapore Airlines in 2003 set up Tiger Airways Holdings as a
joint venture with Ryanair, Ireland's successful low-cost carrier.
  
   "From its base at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thai Tiger will be well
positioned to also serve destinations in North Asia and the Indian
sub-continent," Tiger Airways Group president Tony Davis said.

Luxembourg   
The European Union's executive was right to
block Ryanair's takeover of Irish rival Aer Lingus because the deal
would have created a near-monopoly, the EU's court ruled Tuesday.
  
Ryanair launched its takeover bid in 2006, shortly after the Irish
government privatised Aer Lingus. But the European Commission vetoed
the move, arguing that it would give the merged company unfair
control of the Irish air-travel market. Ryanair challenged the veto.
  
"None of the arguments put forward by Ryanair is capable of
calling into question the findings made by the commission ...
according to which the implementation of the merger would
significantly impede effective competition," a statement from the
EU's General Court read.
  
The proposed joint company's dominance of routes from Ireland's
main airports would be "monopolistic or very significant and ...
sufficient, in themselves, to validate the commission's finding that
the implementation of the merger must be declared incompatible with
the common market," the statement read.
  
However, the court turned down a claim from Aer Lingus asking the
commission to force Ryanair to sell off its roughly 30-per-cent stake
in the former national carrier.
  
The commission rejected that claim in 2007, arguing that the
Ryanair holding was not a controlling interest and was therefore not
subject to EU merger rules.
  
That decision was right because "in the absence of effective
control by Ryanair over Aer Lingus, Ryanair's shareholding cannot be
likened to a merger which has already arisen, which would give the
EU was right to block Ryanair 's Aer Lingus takeover, court rules
commission the right to act," the court ruled.
  
Either company could challenge the decision in the EU's highest

DPA x EU Transport Airlines  EU to rule on airline mergers within weeks Brussels   
The European Union's executive is to rule on the
legality of a number of airline mergers within weeks, officials in
Brussels confirmed Tuesday.
  
The European Commission is responsible for enforcing the EU's
strict laws on keeping fair competition. In that role, it has the
right to veto any takeovers which it thinks would harm competition.
  
The commission is set to rule on the planned merger between Iberia
and British Airways by July 15, the proposed tie-up between US
carriers United and Continental by July 27 and the tentative fusion
of Greek carriers Olympic and Aegean Airlines by July 30, commission
spokeswoman Amelia Torres said.
  
The Brussels-based body also hopes to finish analysing a proposed
partnership deal between BA, Iberia and American by the end of July,
but has no legal obligation to do so, Torres said.
  
EU officials had earlier warned that the proposed partnership,
which involved in-depth cooperation on trans-Atlantic routes, could
breach competition rules.
  
Earlier on Tuesday, the EU's court ruled that the commission had
been right to veto a takeover of former Irish national carrier Aer
Lingus by no-frills rival Ryanair, saying that it would have created
a near-monopoly on some routes.

Irish budget airline Ryanair Tuesday reported
pre-tax profits of 341 million euros (419 million dollars) in the
last financial year up to the end of March 2010.
  
The company said passenger numbers were up by 14 per cent compared
with the previous year, and revenue rose by 2 per cent. Ryanair said
it would pay a one-off dividend to shareholders totalling 500 million
euros - the first in its history.
  
The results, which follow a loss at the airline in the previous
year, do not include the cost of disruption to flights from volcanic
ash earlier this year, estimated at 50 million euros.

Budget airline Ryanair has been hit with a 3-million-
euro (3.7-million-dollar) fine for failing to render sufficient aid
to passengers stranded in April when a cloud of volcanic ash blocked
much of European airspace.
  
The ruling by Italy's ENAC flight security agency was reported
Sunday in the daily La Repubblica.
  
The newspaper reported at least 178 cases in which Ryanair
neglected its duties to passengers stranded at Ciampino airport when
a cloud of volcanic ash from the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajoekull
prevented flights across huge swaths of European airspace.
  
In some cases entire families - some with small children and
elderly members - were not offered sufficient food, water, lodging or
alternative flights during the flight stoppage, according to the
report.
  
ENAC and Italian civil air authorities had to step in to care for
the stranded passengers. Airlines are legally required to care for
and seek alternate flights for stranded passengers.

Ryanair  =  Brussels/London   
All passengers need to be reimbursed for
the costs they incurred during the travel chaos provoked by the
volcanic ash cloud from Iceland, the European Commission told budget
airline industry leader Ryanair on Thursday.
  
The European Union's executive, responsible for policing the
bloc's laws, was reacting to statements widely reported in the
British media by Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, who said his company
would only pay out the cost of cancelled flights.
  
But Helen Kearns, spokeswoman for transport commissioner Siim
Kallas, said EU rules require airlines to also refund passengers for
accommodation and food expenses incurred while waiting for an
alternative flight to take them home.
  
"There are no discount passenger rights for discount airlines,"
she told reporters in Brussels, stressing that there are clear rules
"and Ryanair will have to apply them like everybody else."
  
The Irish-based company appeared to take heed of the warning, as
its website on Thursday correctly informed passengers about the
rights guaranteed by the EU's passenger rights legislation.
  
The commission statement came as the European air safety
coordination body, Eurocontrol, announced that air traffic was
expected to return to "normal levels" on Thursday, with 28,000 to
29,000 scheduled flights taking place.
  
"A small number of cancellations can be expected due to some
limited restrictions and the logistical problems of airlines resuming
their regular schedules," it said in a statement.
  
According to Eurocontrol, "almost all European airspace is
available, with a few exceptions in parts of Southern Finland,
Passengers need to be reimbursed for travel chaos, EU tells Ryanair =
southern Norway, northern Scotland, and western Sweden."
  
Air traffic in Europe started to be grounded on April 15, amidst
fears that ash from the volcano under the Eyjafjallajoekull glacier
could turn into a glassy substance that would damage jet engines.
  
Restrictions were eased starting on Tuesday, after test flights
run over the weekend by several European airlines showed that it was
safe to fly in most parts of the European airspace.

Most flights operated as planned
in European airspace Thursday as flight bans were lifted after a week
of disruptions caused by an ash cloud from an Icelandic volcano.
  
The Icelandic Met Office said the volcano was still active, but
spewing less ash into the atmosphere than after its initial eruption
a week ago.
  
The European air safety coordination body Eurocontrol expected
"almost 100 per cent" of scheduled flights would take off or land on
Thursday.
  
Budget airline industry leader Ryanair was also told by the
European Commission that all passengers need to be reimbursed for the
costs they incurred during the travel chaos.
  
"There are no discount passenger rights for discount airlines,"
Helen Kearns, spokeswoman for Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas,
told reporters. She said EU rules require airlines to also refund
passengers for accommodation and food expenses incurred while waiting

The European Union's executive was reacting to statements widely
reported in the British media by Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, who
said his company would only pay out the cost of cancelled flights.
  
Flights across Europe had been suspended out of fear that ash from
the volcano under the Eyjafjallajoekull glacier could turn into a
glassy substance inside jet engines, damaging them.
  
Since the start of the airport closures last Thursday, 3 million
passengers have had their flights cancelled, the German airport
associations said. More than half of the 190,000 flights scheduled to
take off in Europe in the last week were cancelled, Eurocontrol said.
ROUNDUP: Flights back to normal in Europe, costs assessed =
  
The International Air Transport Association said the air ban has
cost its members 1.7 billion dollars.
  
Companies have also been attempting to assess the fallout for
their businesses of: the failure to deliver orders; delays in
receiving spare parts; cancelled meetings; and stranded staff.
  
Most ordinary travellers have been left out of pocket by the
crisis or forced to pay for extra hotel bills, new air tickets or
alternative transport as they waited for the volcanic ash threat to
recede.
  
Airlines have slammed the closures and are questioning whether the
size and density of the ash cloud over Europe really posed that big a
threat.
  
Three risk zones were introduced early this week according to the
concentration of ash. Flying remains banned in the high-risk zone,
but individual countries were allowed to decide whether to allow
flights in the medium-risk zone. The low-risk zone is open.
  
The Swedish Transport Agency said Thursday that it would also
allow flights in the medium-risk zone. Airlines would have to make
their risk assessment and inspect planes after flights through such
zones, the agency said.
  
Earlier Thursday, the chief executive of the SAS Group, operator
of the joint carrier Scandinavian Airlines, said it was "unfortunate"
that Sweden and Finland had not introduced the medium-risk zone.
  
Mats Jansson said at a presentation of the group's first quarter
results that the disruptions and costs of compensating passengers
from April 15 to 21 cost SAS some 63 million dollars.

   London    
The total shutdown of air traffic over Britain has
been extended for a second day until at least Saturday morning, the
central air traffic control body said Friday.
  
   National Air Traffic Services (Nats) said the clouds of volcanic
ash from the eruption in Iceland continued to cover much of Britain.
  
   So far, an estimated 600,000 passengers have been affected by the
restrictions.
  
   British Airways (BA) said Friday that more than 230 aircraft had
been grounded. BA shares fell by just over 1 per cent to 240 pence on
the London stock market Friday.
  
   The airline said it was "far too soon" to calculate the costs of
the losses incurred, but media reports said shutting down British
airspace would cost airlines more than 100 million pounds (154
million dollars) if the disruption continued into the weekend.    In
the past, similar standstills - caused by strikes - have cost BA up

Ash from an erupting volcano in Iceland has

All flights from and to London's five airports - including
Europe's largest hub, Heathrow - were to be cancelled as of noon on
Thursday, a spokesman for the Gatwick airport said.
  
All airports in Scotland have also been shut down, including those
in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
  
Significant disruptions were also being reported at airports in
Manchester, Liverpool, Luton, Newcastle and Birmingham.
  
The discount airline Ryanair said that it called off all of its
flights from and to Britain starting at 9am (0800 GMT).
  
The country's air-traffic control provider, NATS, said that it has
restricted flights in British airspace because the volcanic ash posed
a safety risk for planes.
  
Airports have encouraged stranded passengers to contact their
respective airlines directly.
  
Meteorologists believe that the ash will take a few days to
disperse. It is impossible to predict how much ash will come down,
they said.
  
The volcano near the Eyjafjallajoekull glacier, about 120
kilometres east of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik, erupted
earlier this week.

Brussels   
United States authorities are thwarting plans by
Ryanair to charge its customers for using the toilets onboard its
planes, the airline's boss Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday.
  
O'Leary, the head of Europe's largest low-cost airline, said he
wanted to remove two out of the three toilets fitted on its planes
to create space for six extra seats, and make passengers pay for the
remaining loo.
  
"Yes, we are thinking of it but we're not getting much help from
the regulatory authorities," he told a news conference in Brussels.
  
The changes would have to be approved by Boeing, the current
supplier of Ryanair's fleet, and by the Federal Aviation Authority
(FAA) of the US, where Boeing is based.
  
But O'Leary complained that both are resisting, citing safety
concerns.
  
"They say that in an emergency evacuation it would take longer if
there were six extra seats," the Ryanair boss said, adding that his
company thinks otherwise.
  
"We think it would take (a) shorter (time), because the bottleneck
at the back of the plane in an emergency evacuation (is) the two
toilets," O'Leary argued.
  
The Ryanair supremo said Boeing and the FAA are also opposed to
another, even more radical plan to maximise passenger numbers - that
of creating standing seats on planes.
  
"We've made no progress at all," O'Leary lamented.

He said he was more sympathetic to safety concerns on this
specific proposal, but still insisted that it could be workable.

DPA FINANCE France Justice EU Aviation   Air France is suing Ryanair over local subsidies  =  Paris   
French airline Air France said Thursday it has filed
a complaint with the European Commission against Ryanair over
subsidies its Irish low-cost rival is allegedly receiving from French
regional and local airports.
  
"Ryanair's agreement to serve these airports is conditional on the
airport authorities' granting aid to it," Air France said in a
statement posted on its web site.
  
"Such measures, taking the form of reduced airport taxes,
preferential ground handling rates at certain airports or marketing
aid, have been implemented by at least 25 French regional airports."
  
According to the daily Le Figaro, Air France has calculated that
Ryanair receives some 660 million euros (900 million dollars) in such
subsidies in Europe each year, 35 million euros in France alone.
  
Air France charged that the aid is "contrary to European
regulations" and is "often financed by the airport taxes paid by
other airlines at these airports."
  
The company said it had filed the complaint in Brussels at the end
of November 2009.
  
Contacted by Le Figaro, Ryanair denied receiving any state aid
whatsoever.
  
"It is Air France that is receiving illegal aid in the form of
airport tax discounts on its domestic lines," a spokesman for the
company was quoted as saying.
  
The suit is the latest skirmish in a lengthy and often bitter
competition between the two carriers.

In 2006, Ryanair filed two complaints against Air France - one

Ryanair has also attacked other state airlines, such as Germany's
Lufthansa and Alitalia, saying they benefited from illegal subsidies
from their respective governments.
  
Ryanair has been the target of suits filed by other European
airlines on allegations similar to those made by Air France.

The European Union and Georgia on Friday inked an

restrictions on flights between their territories, in what officials
expect to be a major boost for Georgia's economy.
  
The EU is keen to strengthen ties with Georgia and its people, and
sees improved transport links as a key way of doing so.
  
The agreement is "very important for further strengthening the
overall economic, trade and tourism relations between Georgia and the
EU. Indeed, it will allow Georgia to become a full partner of the EU
in aviation and gradually integrate Georgia into a pan-European
aviation market," EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said.
  
Once ratified by EU member states and the Georgian and European
parliaments, the deal will allow any carrier from any EU member state
to operate flights to Georgia from any EU country, and Georgian
carriers to fly throughout the EU.
  
It will also lift all restrictions on the number, frequency and
cost of flights, a commission statement said.
  
At present, direct flights exist between Georgia and nine EU
states, Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Latvia,
Lithuania, the Netherlands and Poland.
  
EU-Georgia passenger traffic has grown by an average of 10 per
cent per year over the past five years, while cargo traffic has grown
26 per cent annually, the statement said.
  
Similar agreements with other former-Soviet states - albeit ones
closer to Western Europe, such as the Baltics - saw a rush of
low-cost operators such as EasyJet and Ryanair opening flights to the

A four-day strike beginning Monday at
Lufthansa will be the biggest stoppage in the German airline's
history - knocking out 3,200 flights according to the company's
skeleton timetable.
  
   The only parallels in the past decade in Europe were strikes that
disrupted Alitalia in 2008 and Sabena in 2001 as those companies were
on the brink of collapse, and a 36-hour strike by French air traffic
controllers that grounded most aviation in France in 2001.
  
Lufthansa is trying to reschedule passengers onto jets flown by
non-union staff and is offering refunds to passengers who must cancel
trips. There has been a rush in recent days to book with other
airlines, or to rebook travel within Europe by rail instead.
  
   Lufthansa employs 4,500 pilots.
  
A union, the Cockpit Association, demanded last May pay rises of
6.4 per cent, a no-layoffs promise and commitments from the airline
not to outsource operations to lower-pay subsidiaries.
  
Months of talks have ended in deadlock and the union took a strike
vote. Members this week authorized an all-out stoppage.
  
   Experienced Lufthansa flight captains earn between 110,000 and
250,000 euros (150,000 and 340,000 dollars) per year.
  
The strike has won little sympathy from other company employees,
such as cabin crew and ground staff, who are paid far less, not to
mention check-in and telesales staff who must soothe the angry
customers.

airports for all the jets that will be idle from Monday. Pilots still

join the strike.
  
Lufthansa, carried 55 million passengers in 2008, the most recent
year covered by data from the International Air Transport Association
(IATA), making it the world's top full-price international carrier.
  
Including US and Chinese domestic carriers and Ryanair, Lufthansa
Group ranked eighth by overall passenger numbers.
  
The German airline group has tried to rein in operating costs as
the recession cuts into its passenger and cargo traffic. An austerity
programme code-named Climb 2011 aims to shave 1 billion euros (1.4
billion dollars) annually off the parent's passenger fleet costs.
  
Lufthansa has taken over a series of other airlines, where pilots
work for more modest wages. That is precisely what the Cockpit
Association fears, since this expansion offers Lufthansa a way to
gradually prune the best-paid part of its workforce.
  
The strike will not affect subsidiaries such as Swiss, Austrian
Airlines, Brussels Airlines, British Midland, Eurowings, Air Dolomiti
and Lufthansa Italia.

   Frankfurt   
Pilots at German airline Lufthansa on Sunday
ignored appeals to abandon plans for a four-day strike that will
force the cancellation of some 3,200 flights and snarl aviation
worldwide.
  
The Cockpit Association, which has called the biggest airline
strike in Germany's history, said it assumed the strike was on,
despite a last-minute appeal by managers for talks.
  
   Lufthansa says it will offer a skeleton service from Monday to
Thursday, employing pilots who normally work in the management and
are no longer in the union.
  
Its subsidiary Swiss and its Star Alliance partner LOT of Poland
are to fly bigger planes in and out of Germany this week to make up
some of the shortfall.
  
Germany has never suffered disruption of its air traffic on such a
scale.
  
The only parallels in the past decade in Europe were strikes that
disrupted Alitalia in 2008 and Sabena in 2001 as those companies were
on the brink of collapse, and a 36-hour strike by French air traffic
controllers that grounded most aviation in France in 2001.
  
Lufthansa carries 150,000 passengers a day, or 55 million a year.
The most recent data from the International Air Transport Association
(IATA), for 2008, indicates it is the world's top full-price
international carrier by passenger numbers.
  
   Including US and Chinese domestic carriers and Ryanair, Lufthansa
Group ranked eighth by overall passenger numbers.
ROUNDUP: Pilots hold course towards Lufthansa strike =
  
As midnight approached, Lufthansa management suggested
"unconditional" talks with the union, but demanded the pilots drop
their agenda, which seeks pay hikes, job guarantees and an end to pay
differentials between Lufthansa in Germany and foreign subsidiaries.
  
   Experienced Lufthansa flight captains earn between 110,000 and
250,000 euros (150,000 and 340,000 dollars) per year. The maximum is
approximately the same as the pay package for Germany's chancellor.
  
Joerg Handwerg of Cockpit said, "I'm firmly convinced we will be
striking tomorrow."
  
German Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer offered to mediate, but
there was no sign this had changed anything. Ramsauer said he was
sure neither side wanted to fight to the bitter end.
  
More than 4,000 Cockpit members are to stop work at Lufthansa
passenger services, the European budget airline unit Germanwings and
Lufthansa Cargo.
  
   Months of talks which began last May ended in deadlock. The union
took a strike vote. Members last week authorized an all-out stoppage.
  
   The strike has won little sympathy from other company employees,
such as cabin crew and ground staff, who are paid far less, not to
mention check-in and telesales staff who must deal with angry
customers.
  
   Lufthansa may be short of parking space at main German
airports for all the jets that will be idle from Monday. Pilots still
abroad early Monday were told to work one more homebound leg, then
join the strike.
  
Lufthansa estimates one third of scheduled flights of jets
sporting the Lufthansa bird logo can proceed and it will charter
planes from other carriers to keep two thirds of Germanwings flights
working.
  
Lufthansa chief human resources officer Stefan Lauer said the
company was willing to meet pilot demands by promising no sackings up
to the end of 2012, but required a pay freeze of more than the 12
months so far offered by Cockpit in wage bargaining.
  
The main issue at stake is the fear among pilots that low-pay
subsidiaries will take over routes where parent-company pilots
currently earn good wages. It is demanding the German pay scale be
applied to subsidiaries taking over parent-company routes.
  
Cockpit spokesman Handwerg charged that Lufthansa Group's fleet
had grown in eight years from 300 to 850, but only two of the
additional planes were piloted at Lufthansa pay scales.
  
   Lufthansa is trying to reschedule passengers onto jets flown by
the non-union staff or onto trains, and is offering refunds to
passengers who must cancel trips. There has been a rush in recent
days to book with other airlines.

Lithuania celebrated Wednesday the decision by
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair to invest 140 million dollars in a new
hub in the country's second-largest city, Kaunas.
  
 Riga airport had been hoping to attract Ryanair to Latvia, but on
Tuesday the company announced it had plumped for Kaunas.
  
   "We're excited about this decision," Mantas Nocius of the
Lithuanian Development Agency told the German Press Agency dpa. "It's
a good sign for a small town like Kaunas."
  
Nocius said new low tariffs introduced by the Lithuanian
authorities had made the Irish carrier choose Lithuania as its first
hub in central and eastern Europe.
  
   Ryanair - which already operates at Kaunas airport - will build a
new hangar at the airport, base two aircraft there and increase the
number of its flights from nine to 18.
  
     Announcing the decision, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary

for criticism, accusing it of charging high fares.
  
   However airBaltic was quick to react, winning approval Tuesday

terminal in Riga.

The company is now predicting a full year net profit of 275

In the third quarter, 16 million passengers flew with Ryanair, 14
per cent more than in the same period the previous year.
  
O'Leary said that with the "increasing pace of consolidation and
closures among our competitors allied to Ryanairs continuing fleet

   London   
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Friday scrapped
plans for an order of 200 new aircraft from US manufacturer Boeing in
what it said was a revised strategy aimed at cutting future capital
expenditure.
  
The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which were due to be delivered after
2012, would have had an estimated value of 9.2 billion pounds (15
billion dollars), aviation analysts said.
  
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said in a statement that the company
had no plans to "reopen discussions with Boeing or any other
manufacturers."
  
Instead, the no-frills airline would focus its efforts on
maintaining strong traffic and new route growth into 2010 and brief
shareholders of its "revised strategy which will comprise much
reduced capital expenditure through 2011 and 2012."
  
The statement said Ryanair regretted that the prolonged
negotiations with Boeing had "failed to reach a mutually acceptable

While agreement had been reached on pricing for deliveries during
the 2013-16 period, the US supplier had been unwilling "to
incorporate some other terms and conditions from our existing

   A separate deal for the delivery of 112 Boeing 737s over the next

"I believe it is appropriate to return these surplus funds
to shareholders, if we cannot use them to purchase aircraft on terms
which enable us to meet our demanding return on capital targets,"
O'Leary said.
  
But Ryanair's main rival, Easyjet, interpreted the withdrawal from
the aircraft purchase as a sign that the era of rapid growth in
budget airlines and their fleets was coming to an end.
  
"The era of endless fast growth and even larger aircraft fleets is
near its end. Low-cost airlines are now the mainstream way to fly in
Europe. As such, it's getting difficult to find significant new
passenger traffic which is profitable," Easyjet founder Stelios
Haji-Ioannou told the Guardian newspaper.
  
Ryanair has vowed to get through the recession and spiralling
costs without fare increases or fuel surcharges. The airline
currently operates a fleet of 202 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
  
In early November, Ryanair reported a half-year pre-tax profit of

Turbulence from the wake of a landing Ryanair jet
blew roof-tiles off a house near Luebeck airport, an airport
spokeswoman said Friday.
  
The tiles were sucked off the roof by a swirling column of air and
dashed into the garden beneath, frightening the 81-year-old female
occupant of the house in northern Germany, local media reported.
  
The precise cause of the incident was not clear however, as
airport authorities said that the jet was at its normal approach-
height when it overflew the house. Eyewitnesses, the Luebecker News
said, claimed that the plane was flying too low.
  
"We regret this incident, and are taking it seriously," airport
spokeswoman Kirsten Nielsen said.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Business Aviation   ROUNDUP: Ryanair reports profits, warns Boeing to cut plane prices  
=  London   
Irish budget airline Ryanair Monday reported
half-year pre-tax profits of 419.4 million euros (618.4 million
dollars) but warned that continued cut-price fares would result in
losses for the rest of the year.
  
The airline said falling fuel costs had boosted profits by 300 per
cent in the six months up to the end of September. Results in the
same six months last year were just 105.2 million euros.
  
Ryanair's passenger numbers grew to 36.4 million in the reporting
period, an increase of 15 per cent over the same period last year.
  
In his results statement, Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary threatened
to withdraw from talks with Boeing for the proposed acquisition of
around 200 new planes if the US producer refused to cut its price.
  
"We won't continue these discussions indefinitely and have
signalled to Boeing that if they are not completed before the year
end, then Ryanair will end its relationship with Boeing and confirm a
series of order deferrals and cancellations," he said.
  
Ryanair said revenue was down by 2 per cent at 1.8 billion euros
but results were "heavily distorted" by a 42-per cent drop in fuel
costs compared with the same period in 2008.
  
The airline said this "masked" a 17-per cent decline in average
fares. Prices would fall 20 per cent over the rest of the year,
resulting in losses for the last two quarters, it said.
  
Unlike other airlines, Ryanair has vowed not to introduce fuel
surcharges as a result of high oil prices last year and said it would
continue offering low fares throughout the recession.
ROUNDUP: Ryanair reports profits, warns Boeing to cut plane prices =
  
O'Leary said market conditions were "still difficult" due to what
he called an "an absence of consumer confidence."
  
However, the group would be "substantially profitable at a time
when many of our competitors are losing money, consolidating or going
bust," he said.
  
Traffic growth was strong "at the expense of declining average
fares," he said, adding that the weakness of the British pound and
rising tourist taxes in Britain and Ireland had hit takings.
  
Ryanair had won customers from high-fare carriers led by Air
France, British Airways and Lufthansa and expected the trend to
continue, said O'Leary.
  
He said he was planning to switch some of Ryanair's winter
capacity to "lower cost countries" such as Belgium, the Netherlands,
Italy and Spain due to high airport charges and "stupid tourist
taxes."
  
However, he also insisted that the airline remained "ideally
positioned to return to substantial profit growth" as Europe emerged
from the economic downturn.
  
O'Leary said he would consider "binning growth plans" if he
could not agree a deal with Boeing over an order for 200 aircraft due
for delivery between 2013 and 2016.
  
"We see no point in continuing to grow rapidly in a declining
yield environment, where our main aircraft partner is unwilling to
play its part in our cost reduction programme by passing on some of
the enormous savings which Boeing have enjoyed both from suppliers
and more efficient manufacturing in recent years," he said.
  
"We would prefer to grow, but if Boeing doesn't share our vision,
then I believe that Ryanair should change course before the end of
this fiscal year and manage the airline over the next three years to
maximise cash for distribution to shareholders," he said.

Budget airline Ryanair is to increase its charges

to make passengers take carry-on-luggage only, the airline said
Friday.
  
From October 1 the charge for bags carried in the hold of aircraft

in at the airport.
  
The hold baggage charge for online check-in will rise from 10 to
15 pounds.
  
At the same time, passengers will, for the first time, be allowed
to travel with two checked-in bags, which have to be paid for
separately. The total baggage allowance will be doubled to 30
kilograms.
  
Hand luggage will continue to be free of charge, the Irish carrier
said.
  
"In order to persuade passengers to travel with carry-on bags
only, and to defray the cost of some of these fare reductions, we are
increasing baggage allowances and fees with effect from October 1,"
said the airline.

Irish budget airline Ryanair has given a warning
that its policy of drastic price cuts to attract passengers could
have a negative impact on full year profits.
  
The group said Monday that annual net profits were now expected at
the lower end of market forecasts of between 200 million
euros (285 million dollars) and 300 million euros.
  
Ryanair reduced fares by 13 per cent on average over the three
months to June 30, which saw revenues come under pressure, although
significantly lower fuel costs helped profits climb almost
seven-fold.
  
Ryanair, which last week announced it was cutting its winter
services out of London's Stansted airport by 40 per cent, recently
reported first quarter net profits of 136.5 million euros.
  
Its revenues fell slightly, down by 0.3 per cent, to 774.7 million
euros, while passenger numbers rose by 11 per cent.

Berlin   
Germany's flagship airline Lufthansa said Friday
that the current problems of the airline industry amounted to "the
worst crisis in its history," citing falling passenger numbers and
crippling ticket-price wars.
  
Lufthansa board member Roland Busch said in a company publication
appearing Friday that "demand has fallen in all areas of the
business."
  
Busch added that in the economy class segment, passenger numbers
had "sunk drastically."
  
Last week Lufthansa said it was planning to trim its workforce
workforce as part of a new cost-cutting drive aimed at saving 1
billion euros (1.41 billion dollars) by the end of 2011.
  
Lufthansa has for the past three years attempted to compete with
budget airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet on European routes by
offering 99-euro fares on its flights.
  
Busch said passengers were no longer choosing airlines based on
brand loyalty or the benefits of frequent flyer programmes, but
solely on price.
  
"The keyword here is 'Best Buy'," he said.
  
The cost-cutting measures, to be launched under the airline's so-
called "Climb 2011" programme, come as the global aviation business
struggles in the face of the world economic downturn.
  
In June, global airline body IATA said the world's airlines were
expected to lose 9 billion dollars this year.

Sofia was visiting the British capital to see her brother,
former king Constantine of Greece, who was undergoing a heart
operation.

DPA FINANCE Britain Business Aviation   ROUNDUP: Ryanair reports first ever annual loss  =  London   
European budget airline Ryanair reported
the first loss in its 24-year-history Tuesday, saying it had
gone into the red by 169 million euros (239 million dollars) last
year due to high fuel bills and writedowns linked to its stake in
rival Aer Lingus.
  
The pre-tax loss in the year up to the end of March 2009,
compares with a profit of 481 million euros in the previous year, the
Dublin-based Irish low-cost carrier said.
  
Ryanair said that the cost of fuel rose by 59 per cent to 1.26
billion euros in the reporting period, accounting for 45 per cent of
operating costs.
  
However, annual sales were up by 8.4 per cent to 2.94 billion
euros and passenger numbers increased by 15 per cent to 59 million,
overtaking those of Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa,
Ryanair said.
  
The fundamental strength of the Ryanair model had been underlined
by the passenger growth achieved despite the global recession and
record high oil prices, Ryanair said.
  
Chief executive Michael O'Leary, in typically buoyant mood,
predicted that the airline would make profits of between 200 and 300
million euros in the current financial year, while most of Ryanair's
competitors would be reporting "material traffic and yield declines."
  
He said Ryanair expected a further traffic growth of 15 per cent
to 67 million passengers in the current financial year as the airline
continued to drive down costs and fares and in an attempt to "gain
traffic from high fare competitors."
  
ROUNDUP: Ryanair reports first ever annual loss =
Significantly lower oil prices had enabled Ryanair to secure 90
per cent of its fuel requirements as the company expected fuel costs
to be 450 million euros lower this year.
  
Ryanair said it had written down the value of its 29.8-per-
cent stake in Aer Lingus by a further 222 million euros, after Aer
Lingus' share price fell.
  
Ryanair had two takeover approaches for Aer Lingus rejected since
2006, the last being turned down in January this year by the Irish
government, which is the second-largest shareholder in Aer Lingus.
  
Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus had proved to be "an albatross
around the company's neck," analyst Richard Hunter of Hargreaves
Lansdown Stockbrokers said Tuesday.

DPA FINANCE Britain Business Aviation   Ryanair reports first annual loss in 2008/2009  =  London   
Leading budget airline Ryanair reported its first
annual pre-tax loss Tuesday, saying it had gone into the red by 169
million euros (239 million dollars) last year following a fuel bill
increase of 59 per cent.
  
The loss run up by the end of March, 2009, compares with a profit
of 481 million euros in the previous year and comes after Ryanair
faced record oil prices and a hefty writedown on the value of its
investment in rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus.
  
Ryanair said that the cost of fuel rose to 1.26 billion euros from
791.3 million euros a year before, as oil prices reached record highs
during 2008.
  
The company said it had written down the value of its 29.8-per-
cent stake in Aer Lingus by a further 222 million euros, after Aer
Lingus' share price fell.

DPA CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT Spain Royalty Aviation   Spanish queen uses low-cost airline  =  Madrid   
Spain's Queen Sofia, 70, has twice used a low-cost
airline for private travel, Spanish media reported Tuesday.
  
On Thursday, Sofia had travelled to London, where her brother, the
former king Constantine of Greece, was to undergo a heart operation.
  
To return to Spain, Sofia took a Ryanair flight to the northern
city of Santander, where she needed to be present at a military
parade on Saturday, the daily Periodico reported.
  
Sofia then used the same airline to return to London on Sunday.
  
The low-cost airline was "the best option" for the queen, palace
sources were quoted as saying.
  
Spanish royals used regular flights for private travel, with the
exception of King Juan Carlos, who always travelled by military
plane, the sources explained.
  
Sofia's fellow passengers said they had paid 15 euros (21 dollars)
for the return trip between Santander and London.
  
The news about Sofia's choice came just as the opposition was
accusing the governing socialists of using military planes to go to
electoral rallies in the run-up to the European elections on June 7.

DPA FINANCE EU Transport Airlines   Nine airlines on EU "black list" for misleading websites  =  Brussels   
The European Union on Thursday publicly scolded
Emirates, Turkish, Royal Air Maroc and six other airlines for
persistently misleading customers on their websites.
  
The EU's "black list", which also includes the likes of Aeroflot,
Northwest and Olympic, emerged from an 18-month crackdown on
misleading adverts and unfair practices reported on 137 airline
websites in 15 EU countries plus Norway.
  
Many of the complaints refer to deceptive "headline" prices, which
disguise hidden extra costs.
  
To comply with EU consumer protection rules, websites were judged
according to a 14-point check list, which asked if all such extras
such as taxes, charges and fees were included, and if extra costs
were added as opt-in or opt-out options.
  
While 115 of the offending websites have since agreed to comply
with EU rules, the nine airlines either ignored or responded
inadequately to the EU's complaints, said EU Consumer Protection
Commissioner Meglena Kuneva.
  
"This a signal that they do not care about their customers,"
Kuneva said.
  
However officials pointed to the fact that the vast majority of
airlines - 52 out of 67 - have either been given a "clean bill of
health", or have promptly committed themselves
to addressing the issues raised.
  
That list now includes previous offenders such as low-cost carrier
Ryanair and Austrian Airlines.

"This first pan-European enforcement investigation has shown it
has real teeth and can deliver," Kuneva said.
  
The European Commission, which launched its investigation
in September 2007, has given persistent offenders until July to
remedy the situation or face the wrath of national regulators.

Eds: Confirms earlier report   =
  
Athens (dpa) - After years of failed privatization attempts, the
Greek government sealed a deal Friday with the country's largest
buyout firm, Marfin Investment Group, for the sale of debt-ridden
carrier Olympic Airlines, said Development Minister Kostis
Hatzidakis.
  
The deal involving Marfin (MIG) comes a month after the
conservative government made a last-minute appeal for investors to
rescue Olympic, after an international tender failed to produce
satisfactory offers.
  
Marfin submitted a 62.4-million-euro (79-million-dollar) bid for
Olympic's flight operations and technical maintenance base.
  
Although details of the deal were not immediately released, the
government said MIG will be bound to take over the ground-handling
unit, totaling 44.8 million euros, if negotiations with Swissport, a
subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial, fall through.
  
"All the advisors of the government have informed us that
negotiations with MIG for the sale of Olympic's flight operations and
technical maintenance has had a successful end," Hatzidakis said.
  
The Greek government said that it will still require the green
light from the European Commission for the deal to become binding.
  
Last year, the Commission blocked an attempt by Ryanair to acquire
rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, saying that the move may destroy
competition at Dublin Airport in Ireland.
  
The deal between Marfin and the Greek government was reportedly
struck hours before MIG threatened to walk away and just as the
government received two more bids to acquire the airline by Chrysler
ROUNDUP: Greece seals deal for sale of debt-ridden state airline
for 210 million euros, and by Greek private carrier Aegean Airlines.
  
Although Aegean, which is Olympic's main competitor for Greece's
domestic routes, offered an attractive proposal of 170 million euros
to purchase the ailing airline, many expressed fears that the sale
could create a monopoly and eventually be blocked by the European
Commission.
  
Founded in 1957 by shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, Olympic
steadily declined after being operated for decades by the state, with
reported losses of 450 million euros a year.
  
The government has spent years seeking private investors to take
over the airline, but the process has been complicated by the
European Commission's demand that the company repay unlawfully-
distributed state aid.
  
The last attempt to privatize the airline was September 2008, when
the government floated a tender to split the loss-making airline into
three units - flying, ground handling and aircraft maintenance - to
facilitate a sale.

After luggage check-in charges and speedy boarding
fees, leading budget airline Ryanair is considering levies for the
use of cabin loos to meet costs, chief executive Michael O'Leary said
Friday.
  
The Irish entrepreneur said passengers might in future have to pay
a pound (1.42 dollars) to spend a penny on his fleet. He did not
reveal if and how the charge could possibly also be made in euros,
given the airline's many European destinations.
  
"One thing we have looked at in the past and are looking at again
is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on the toilet door so
that people might actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in
future," O'Leary said on BBC television.
  
"We are always looking at ways of making air travel cheaper. We
are all about finding ways of raising revenue so we can keep lowering
air fares," he added.
  
Asked about the possibility that not all Ryanair travellers might
have a spare pound in their pocket, he said: "I don't think there is
anybody in history that has got on board a Ryanair aircraft with less
than a pound."
  
Rochelle Turner, of consumer magazine Which? Holiday, said: "It
seems Ryanair is prepared to plumb any depth to make a fast buck and,
once again, is putting profit before the comfort of its customers."
  
"Charging people to go to the toilet might result in fewer people
buying overpriced drinks on board, though - that would serve Ryanair
right," she predicted.

Irish budget airline Ryanair is to include four new

This increases to 50 the number of routes from Frankfurt Hahn, the
airline announced Tuesday.
  
Ryanair had promised to increase its operations at the airport,
situated approximately 120 kilometres from the city of Frankfurt,
after the airport operator cancelled a proposed three-euro departure
tax in January.
  
Alongside Rimini, a popular Italian holiday resort, the new
destinations in the summer schedule are Alicante in Spain,
Carcassonne in France and Osijek in Croatia.

Ryanair Thursday became the first low-cost airline
to launch an in-flight mobile phone service that will eventually be

carrier said.
  
The system, available initially on 20 aircraft, would be extended

from European Union (EU) regulators.
  
Calls would cost between 1.50 pounds and 3 pounds (2.15 and 4.30

e-mails between 1 and 2 pounds.
  
"This service will allow passengers to keep in touch with the

to grow rapidly," said Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary.
  
A number of European airlines, including Air France-KLM, BA and
bmi are currently testing similar schemes, while Lufthansa has ruled
out using the service.

Budapest   
German courier DHL confirmed on Friday that it
would close its logistics base at the FlyBalaton airport, in another
blow to the struggling provincial airport in western Hungary, next to
Central Europe's largest lake.
  
DHL established a cargo base at the airport in the autumn of 2007,
but last summer stopped running daily flights from Dresden in
Germany. The base is to close by the end of February.
  
As DHL confirmed newspaper reports that it was pulling out
entirely, Cape Clear Aviation - the Irish-Hungarian company behind
FlyBalaton - was already in desperate talks with partners to try and
secure traffic for the airport from spring.
  
The airport suffered a major blow last year when its biggest
customer, the Irish budget airline Ryanair, cancelled all routes to
FlyBalaton in October.
  
This move prompted management to suspend all winter flights.
  
One ray of hope for the troubled airport comes from the German
airline Lufthansa, which is reportedly already selling tickets for
flights to Lake Balaton from April.
  
The Hungarian government is keen to revamp Lake Balaton - a
popular tourist destination for Eastern Europeans during the
communist era - as part of its New National Development Plan.
  
"The Hungarian state attaches great importance to the continuing
operation of (the airport)," Tamas Suchmann, president of the Balaton
Development Council said on Friday.
  
DHL pulls out of airport on " Hungarian Sea", Lufthansa to stay =
In earlier interviews, Suchmann did not rule out the possibility
of state support to keep FlyBalaton open.
  
The foundation stone of the Balatonring, a MotoGP racing track
near Balaton, was laid in November last year just a few kilometres
from FlyBalaton airport.
  
Balatonring could do for motorcycle racing in Hungary what the
famous Hungaroring racing circuit did for Formula One, and plans to
host a Hungarian Grand Prix in September.
  
The past few years have seen dozens of new tourist resort
developments around the 77-kilometre-long lake, including yachting
clubs and golf courses.
  
The closure of the FlyBalaton airport in the town of Sarmellek at
the south western end of the lake would be a serious blow to the
local travel industry.

Irish budget airline Ryanair announced Monday that

quarter of its current financial year.
  
The airline said it had swung into the red to the tune of 101.5

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said it hoped to make

euros.
  
The airline was battered by last year's oil price rise, which saw
its fuel costs soar by 71 per cent in the final three months of 2008.
  
However, oil prices have since collapsed amid the global economic
downturn.

Ryanair won a court case against the European

Charleroi for a 15-year period in return for an additional 90 per

But the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg ruled Wednesday that
the deal was part of normal economic activity on the part of
Walloon's regional authorities.

Thousands of passengers using budget airlines to and
from London's Stansted airport suffered severe disruption Monday
following an environmental protest which temporarily shut down the
airport's single runway.
  
Irish carrier Ryanair, the airline most affected by the nine-hour
protest by environmental group Plane Stupid, said it cancelled 56
flights to short-haul destinations in Europe, including Poland,
Germany, France and Italy.
  
Other airlines decided against cancellations, the airport said.
  
Police said 57 protestors were arrested after cutting through the
fence with bolt-cutters and chaining themselves together on the runway,
using sheets of security fencing for protection.
  
The protest hit the first wave of Monday morning flights in an out
of Stansted, which is London's third-biggest airport, situated some 50
kilometres north-east of the capital.
  
Plane Stupid said the protest was to highlight the "hypocrisy"
between government climate change goals and reality, following the
green light for the construction of a second runway at Stansted.
  
"We're here because our parents' generation has failed us and its
now down to young people to stop climate change by whatever peaceful
means we have left," a statement posted on the group's website said.
  
Their protest would prevent the release of thousands of tonnes of
greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, Plane Stupid said.
  
However, the protest was condemned by the government. A spokesman
for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: "Of course everybody has has a
right to protest, but people also have a right to travel without
unnecessary hindrance."

Up to 40 protestors of the group, which managed to break through a
tall security fence at around 0300 GMT Monday, were arrested, police

Stansted, some 50 kilometres north-east of London, is the British
capital's third-biggest airport predominantly used by budget
airlines, including Ryanair, for European routes.
  
Airport operator BAA earlier warned of severe delays and advised
passengers to check with airlines before setting out.

national carrier with a bid of 1.40 euros (1.78 dollars) per share,
which would value the airline at 748 million euros.
  
Aer Lingus late Monday rejected the offer.
  
SIPTU union leader Gerry McCormack said Ryanair's offer would have
"little or no effect on the ballot, except to make members even more
determined than ever to defend decent pay and conditions within the
aviation sector," RTE reported.
  
Aer Lingus reported a loss of 22.3 million euros for the first six
months of 2008, down from a profit of 2.6 million euros in the same
period of 2007, due to high cost of fuel.
  
It is currently in dispute with its employees over a cost-cutting
plan.
  
Ryanair said the deal would be worth 325 million euros in cash to
shareholders, employees and the Irish government, which owns just
over 25 per cent of the airline.
  
It also said it would double the size of the Aer Lingus fleet from
33 to 66 aircraft over the next five years and create more jobs.
  
McCormack said that given Ryanair's track record, promises about
the fleet expansion and job creation "would carry little credibility"

and even if they were credible "it still raised the spectre of a
monopoly position for an airline not noted for its concern for the
public."
  
Ryanair's previous offer from September 2006 was rejected by the
Irish government and Aer Lingus, which called it "ill- conceived,
contradictory and anti competitive."

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair announced a fresh
bid to take over 100 per cent of privatized Irish national carrier
Aer Lingus on Monday.
  
Ryanair said in a statement that it was offering 1.40 euros (1.78
dollars) per share in Aer Lingus, which it claimed would be worth
325 million euros in cash to shareholders, employees and the Irish
government, which owns just over 25 per cent of the airline.
  
The offer "will lead to one strong Irish airline group, lower

Ryanair said it would double the size of Aer Lingus' short-haul

Dublin (dpa) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair announced a fresh
bid to take over 100 per cent of privatized Irish national carrier
Aer Lingus on Monday.
  
Ryanair said in a statement that it was offering 1.40 euros (1.78

Aer Lingus said it had noted the offer, but had not yet commented
on it.
  
Ryanair claimed the deal would would be worth 325 million euros in

He said only a merged airline would be able to compete with the

French-Dutch airline Air France-KLM.
  
"Aer Lingus, as a small, standalone, regional airline has been

marginalized and bypassed as most other EU flag carriers
consolidate," he said.
  
O'Leary said Ryanair would double the size of Aer Lingus' short-

would create the jobs.
  
Ryanair is a major shareholder in Aer Lingus with a 29.8-per-cent

The company is currently in dispute with its employees over a

Ryanair's previous offer from September 2006 was resisted by the
Irish government, which had just floated the airline at the time, and
by the airline itself, which called it "ill-conceived, contradictory
and anti-competitive."
  
The proposed deal was rejected by the European Commission as
uncompetitive.
  
Jonathan Todd, spokesman for Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes
did not say Monday if Ryanair and the European Commission were in
contact about the latest takeover bid.
  
"As in any merger or takeover case, it is the responsibility of
the parties to verify whether or not it falls into the scope of the
merger regulation and whether they therefore need to inform the
commission," Todd said.
  
In response to O'Leary's claim earlier Monday that the commission
would look more favourably on the current bid as the economic
conditions had changed since 2006, Todd said: "Every bid is dealt on
a case-by-case basis.
  
"Merger regulation requires the European Commission to ensure that
no concentration would give rise to adverse effects on competition,
such as reduced choice for customers or higher prices.
  
"I am not going to preempt a decision on a deal of which we don't
yet have any details."
  
The 2006 offer is currently under appeal at the European Court of
First Instance.

DPA x Italy Accidents   Ryanair plane overruns runway during Rome emergency landing  =  Rome   
A Ryanair Boeing 737 overran a runway Monday at
Rome's Ciampino airport during an emergency landing, Italian
officials said.
  
None of the 166 passengers on board the flight from
Frankfurt, Germany, were injured, according to the ANSA news agency.
  
Pilots decided to make the emergency landing following problems
with one of the plane's engines, Ciampino's rescue services chief,
Marco Ghimenti said.
  
"It appears the landing gear failed to function properly, forcing
the aircraft to overshoot the runway," Ghimenti told television news
channel Sky TG24.
  
Italian flight authorities were investigating the incident, which
took place shortly before 0700 GMT.
  
All flight activity was suspended at Ciampino - Rome's second
airport after the main Leonardo Da Vinci hub - following the
incident.

Leading European budget carrier Ryanair saw its net
profits almost halved in the first six months of its financial year
but its Irish chief executive predicted that the airline would
benefit from a recession in which rivals would go bust.
  
Announcing a 47-per cent fall in net profits to 169 million pounds
(277 million dollars) between April and September of this year, chief
executive Michael O'Leary said he was confident that profits would
recover on account of the falling oil price and increased
competitiveness in the sector.
  
The results relate to the period when the oil price peaked at more
than 140 US dollars a barrel. They have since fallen to less than 790
pounds a barrel.
  
"We have a significant cost advantage over our competitors many of
whom have hedged fuel next year at significantly higher levels than
current market prices," O'Leary said in London Monday.
  
"This will force competitors to further increase airfares and
widen the price gap between them and Ryanair's lowest fares," he
added.
  
O'Leary predicted that as many as 5 or 6 European airlines could
go bankrupt between now and Christmas, with just four European
airlines, including Dublin-based Ryanair, surviving.
  
Eventually just British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa, KLM-Air
France and Ryanair would survive, he forecast.
  
O'Leary, well-known for his controversial comments, said he
believed that Europe "needed a recession" during which loss-making
ROUNDUP: Ryanair hopes to benefit from recession as profits halved
airlines would disappear and the purchasing of aircraft would become
cheaper.
  
He held out the prospect of a new transatlantic low-cost operation
within about 2 to 3 years with economy fares as low as 10 pounds but
stressed that this would not be operated by Ryanair and would be a
completely separate company.
  
He said Ryanair expected to make losses over the next six months
but would continue to dip fares by between 15 and 20 per cent.
  
Figures showed that the number of passengers using Ryanair grew by
19 per cent to 32 million between April and September, compared to
the same period in 2007.
  
Despite the economic slowdown, the airline expected passenger
figures to rise by a further 9 per cent over the winter months.
  
O'Leary said Ryanair had completed a "remarkable performance" over
the last few months in "very difficult trading conditions."
  
"We need a recession. We have had 10 years of growth. A recession
gets rid of crappy loss-making airlines and it means we can buy
aircraft more cheaply," said O'Leary.

London   
Leading budget airline Ryanair said Monday the
steep rise in the oil price had led to a 47-per-cent fall in net
profits in the six months to the end of September.
  
The Irish carrier said net profits between April and September
stood at 169 million pounds (277 million dollars).
  
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said he was confident the profits
would recover if the oil price, currently at 80 US dollars a barrel,
continued to fall.
  
"We have a significant cost advantage over our competitors many of
whom have hedged fuel next year at significantly higher levels than
current market prices," O'Leary said Monday.
  
"This will force competitors to further increase airfares and
widen the price gap between them and Ryanair's lowest fares," he
added.
  
The airline, which has already announced a cut in the flight
schedule, also said it planned to offer flights to the US for 8
pounds by buying planes from struggling rivals.

In a fresh case of spooked airline
passengers petitioning an airline to step up safety, Ryanair faced a
customer revolt this week on an Italy-bound flight, a German airport
said Thursday.
  
Passengers demanded Ryanair arrange a full technical check of the
Boeing 737 which was grounded before a flight Wednesday from Luebeck,
Germany to Pisa, Italy.
  
Luebeck Airport said a technician had already been flying to the
airport with a spare part when some of the 176 passengers began
rounding up signatures.
  
When the plane did take off nine hours late at 10.10 pm, 20 of the
passengers had cancelled the trip.
  
An airport spokeswoman said Ryanair did not allow contract
engineers to work on the plane and had no engineers at Luebeck. It
insisted on flying in its own technician from Stockholm, Sweden to do
the repair.
  
She said the flight, scheduled to depart at 12.45 pm, had been
delayed by a defect in the jet's right wing.

A Ryanair aircraft was Thursday forced to

in Ireland, the budget airline said.
  
A spokesman said the back of the plane struck the runway as it
took off and the pilot returned to the airport as a precaution. He
described the occurrence as a "tail-strike" which was "quite common."
  
"As a precautionary measure the aircraft returned with oxygen
masks deployed and landed safely in Dublin," he said.
  
All 148 passengers disembarked normally and the flight later took
off for London-Stansted airport. No-one was injured.
  
The incident comes less than a month after a Ryanair Boeing en

DPA x Asia Transport Aviation Indonesia Malaysia  FEATURE: Sky-high fuel prices shake up Asia's private 
airlines  Julia Yeow and Sukino Hsumarto, dpa Jakarta/Kuala Lumpur   
With oil prices above 100 dollars a
barrel this year, airlines with the most fuel-efficient fleets have
an obvious advantage.
  
Asia's established national carriers have the edge over their
private competitors in terms of strong shareholders - mostly Asian
governments - and good balance sheets, with easy access to money to
spend on the newest, fuel-efficient aircraft. But they are not the
only ones keeping Boeing and Airbus busy this year.
  
AirAsia, South-East Asia's largest no-frills airline, is currently
Airbus's biggest customer for the fuel-efficient A320. AirAsia has
placed an order for 175 A320s, 50 of which will be operational by
2013, unless the company flies into serious financial problems before
then.
  
In 2007, AirAsia reported a pretax profit of 79 million dollars
on revenue of 458 million dollars. Its mid-year performance in 2008
is expected to be less rosy, but industry experts commend the company
for investing in fuel efficiency at a time of record-high oil prices.
  
"The people who suffer when oil prices spike like this are the
ones with old aircraft," said Andrew Herdman, director general of the
Association of Asia-Pacific Airlines (AAPA). "The beneficiaries are
airlines that have got young fleets with highly fuel-efficient modern
aircraft."
  
That works for both national carriers and budget airlines.
  
In Europe, the no-frills survivors this year have been Ryanair and
Easy Jet. In Asia, the seeming success stories are Malaysia's
AirAsia, Singapore's Tiger and maybe Indonesia's Lion Air, according
FEATURE: Sky-high fuel prices shake up Asia's private airlines
to Herdman.
  
Budget carrier Tiger Airways reported a net profit of 27 million
dollars in the fiscal year that ended in March despite the soaring
fuel costs.
  
It was the first profitable year since Tiger launched in 2004.
  
There have already been some no-frills losers this year.
  
Hong Kong's Oasis, which operated two fairly old Boeing 747s
between the former British colony and London, went into voluntary
liquidation on April 9, laying off 700 employees and leaving 30,000
passengers holding tickets valued at 38.5 million US dollars.
  
The airline blamed its demise on high oil prices and a failure
to purchase the proper aircraft.
  
Thailand's One-Two-Go and Indonesia's Adam Air both shut down
operations this year, although the reason may have had as much to do
with their poor safety records as high fuel costs.
  
The Philippine's budget carrier Cebu Pacific Inc suffered a small
loss of 348,000 dollars in the first half of 2008, but the airline is
in the midst of upgrading its fleet with more economic Airbus A320s
and A319s.
  
Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, has seen its air traffic
grow an average of 20 per cent during the past five years, driven by
by strong domestic demand and the deregulation of the sector that has
given birth to an estimated 50 airlines.
  
Unfortunately, aviation safety standards have not kept up with
the proliferation of airlines.
  
Numerous fatal accidents, such as the Adam Air New Year's Day 2007
crash in the sea off the western coast of Sulawesi, which killed all
102 people on board, followed by a Garuda Indonesia jetliner three
months later in central Java city of Yogyakarta that killed at least
21 people - have tarnished Indonesia's safety record.
  
Safety concerns prompted the European Union to ban all Indonesian
airlines from operating in its territory.
  
One positive impact of the ban was the enforcement of stricter
requirements on the country's plethora of airlines.
  
In addition to closing down Adam Air, once one of Indonesia's
fastest-growing budget airlines, the transport ministry this year
also grounded nine other airlines. It revoked licenses of four
carriers and suspended five others for failing to improve their
safety records. Indonesia is now down to 20 scheduled airlines.
  
Lion Air, the country's largest private domestic carrier, is
buying 178 fuel-efficient Boeing 737-900ER, of which 12 have already
been delivered. The firm expresses confidence in both the domestic
and international market despite the sky-high fuel prices.
  
"There is a very positive outlook for airlines with fuel-efficient
modern fleets," said Hasyim Arsal al-Habsi, Lion Air's spokesman.
  
Prospects are particularly good in Indonesia, where air-safety
FEATURE: Sky-high fuel prices shake up Asia's private airlines
fears pale in comparison to the mayhem on the roads and frequent
accidents at sea.
  
"Indonesia is a vast archipelago nation, and air transportation is
the most feasible facility," Arsal said.

DPA FINANCE Britain Transport Aviation  ROUNDUP: British airport operator faces sale of two London 
airports  updates, adds German material  
London/Essen (dpa ) - The British airport company BAA faces having
to sell two of its three London airports, most likely Gatwick and
Stansted, the British Competition Commission said Wednesday,
rekindling the interest by German Hochtief company to buy Gatwick.
  
The commission, which monitors competition standards, said in a
preliminary report due to be confirmed in April, that the airport
operator should sell two of either Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted
airports.
  
The watchdog also recommended that the BAA give up one of its two
Scottish airports, Edinburgh or Glasgow. In total, BAA runs seven
British airports.
  
The final decision over the future of the airports would be taken
in April, said the commission, which had found that the single
ownership of Britain's leading airports was having "adverse
consequences" on air traffic for passengers and airlines.
  
Reacting to the report, BAA chief Colin Matthews said the company
would not sell Heathrow, yet he conceded the watchdog's findings on
"poor service" and "frustration" for passengers.
  
In Germany, the Essen-based Hochtief company said it continued to
have a "great interest" in Gatwick, the UK's second largest airport.
However, it remained unclear at this time when and under which
conditions the company would get involved, a spokeswoman said.
  
In principle, however, the company was interested also in other
airports should they become available, she said.
  
"We will look at all of them", she said, adding further steps were
expected in the autumn.
  
ROUNDUP: British airport operator faces sale of two London airports
BAA, which belongs to the Spanish Grupo Ferrovial, has come under
pressure in recent years over delays and service standards. The
report especially blamed the company for slow responses to passenger
concerns and the failure to expand the airports' capacities.
  
Besides the German company Hochtief, the British airport operator
Manchester Airport Group expressed an interest for one of the three
London hubs, which process 90 per cent of all air traffic into
London.
  
The group, which operates airports in Manchester, Bournemouth,
East Midlands and Humberside, said it was considering "one or more"
BAA airports.
  
Hochtief had said in the past it wanted to expand its operations
and concessions business which also includes airports. The companies
is currently considering stakes in the airports of Riga, St
Petersburg and possibly also Prague.
  
The British Competition Commission does not explicitly recommend
the sale of Gatwick and Stansted, but BAA has made clear it was
opposed to selling Heathrow.
  
The company also accused the watchdog of mistakes in their
judgement and said an airport sale would be counterproductive.
  
Airlines including Ryanair, Virgin Atlantic Airways and Easyjet
welcomed the commission's findings.

The Irish low-cost carrier recently announced that all bookings

DPA FINANCE Ireland Transport Aviation  NEWS FEATURE: Cheap flights boom hits turbulence over fuel costs  
Anna Tomforde, dpa Dublin/London   
Ryanair, the low-cost airline which
revolutionized travel in Europe for millions over the past 15 years,
now appears to be signalling the end of the cheap flight boom as
rising fuel prices force radical changes in the airline industry.
  
A profit warning from the Irish no-frills carrier, which runs its
main operations from London-Stansted airport, sent airline stocks
into a tailspin Monday, as the group's flamboyant chief executive,
Michael O'Leary, predicted losses of up to 60 million euros (95
million dollars) in the fiscal year of 2008/2009.
  
By revealing a 85-per cent plunge in profits in the first quarter
of the current financial year the usually bullish O'Leary sent
shockwaves through an industry which is struggling to absorb the
soaring price of oil.
  
With rises in air fares now expected across the board, from low-
cost to scheduled airlines, tourism organizers have tried to lure
customers by saying that this summer presents their "last chance" for
a break at affordable fares.
  
In Britain, at least, polls have shown that a third of the
population will rise to the bait of a "last fling" summer holiday
abroad.
  
But at the same time, a record number of Britons, plagued by
rising fuel, energy and food prices, have opted for a destination
closer to home.
  
Ryanair's profit update followed similar downbeat figures from
rival Easyjet which last week warned of a potential 42-per cent drop
NEWS FEATURE: Cheap flights boom hits turbulence over fuel costs
in annual pre-tax profits and cuts in capacity growth.
  
Both budget airlines have announced plans to reduce flights
capacity by up to 15 per cent over the winter months.
  
Their blue chip counterpart, British Airways, had already set the
scene earlier by announcing capacity cuts on winter routes of between
3 and 5 per cent accompanied by "absolutely inevitable" fare hikes of
4 per cent or more for passengers.
  
After celebrating record profits last year, BA has given a bleak
outlook for its current financial year, saying that a total fuel bill
of more than 3 billion pounds threatened to wipe out last year's
profits.
  
But while mainstream airlines such as BA, Lufthansa and Air France
have attempted to compensate for the extra costs by introducing fuel
charges, Ryanair has insisted that it will resist charging a fuel
levy and beat off competition with "aggressive pricing."
  
"We will continue to absorb higher oil costs, even if it means
short-term losses, while we continue to deliver Europe's guaranteed
lowest fares to our 58 million passengers," O'Leary said.
  
But as the fuel crisis bites, analysts believe that rising fares
and a reduction in flights by the end of the summer will force some
well-known names out of business.
  
"Low fares and high growth are giving way to higher fares and
lower growth. This sits uneasily with the low-cost airline model's
traditional emphasis on stimulating demand through low prices," said
Douglas McNeill, a transport analyst at a leading London stockbroker
firm.
  
In future, no-frills passengers would have to be prepared to "pay
more for less," said aviation analyst Doug McVitie. The answer to
that question would define "the shape of global aviation for the next
generation." dpa at sc

Ireland's low-fare airline Ryanair warned Monday
that it is bracing for red-ink of up to 60 million euros (95 million
dollars) in the fiscal 2008/2009 year amid surging fuel costs.
  
At best, the airline said in presenting first-quarter figures, the
company could show break-even results.
  
Ryanair said that in the first quarter starting April 1, it
managed a profit of 21 million euros, plunging 85 per cent from the
same quarter a year earlier.
  
Aviation fuel in the quarter cost the airline 367 million euros,
surging 93 per cent from the same quarter last year. Ryanair said
fuel now accounts for half of the airline's expenses, compared with
36 per cent a year ago.
  
Passenger numbers in the April-June quarter gained by 19 per cent
to 15 million travellers, while revenues rose 12 per cent to 777
million euros.
  
The company said it is basing its earnings projections on an
average oil price of 130 dollars per barrel and on a 5 per cent
decline in ticket prices.

DPA POLITICS Italy Politics  Italian minister "gives the finger" to passengers in Ryanair ad Rome   
Italian Reform Minister Umberto Bossi's giving the
finger to Italy's national anthem led to an outcry earlier this week,
but on Friday it was his supporters who were outraged by Ryanair's
running of an advertisement showing the minister making the gesture.
  
"It is offensive and in bad taste," said Italian parliamentarian,
Massimo Polledri, a member of the Bossi-led Northern League party.
  
Polledri was referring to a photograph of Bossi, middle-finger
raised in the insulting gesture, posted under the phrase "Minister
Bossi to Italian passengers," on the Italian website of budget
airline, Ryanair.
  
The photograph accompanies an advertisement in which Ryanair
offers flights for 10 euros (15 dollars) while slamming the
government's supporting for Italy's state-controlled airline,
Alitalia.
  
"The (Italian) government supports the high fares of Alitalia, the
frequent strikes at Alitalia and can't care less about the Italian
passengers," the ad says.
  
"It would be better for Ryanair to wipe all this, and in
particular its connecting of such false statements with the image of
our leader," said Mario Borghezio, a European Parliament member for
the Northern League.
  
"We are ready to launch a boycott against the company (Ryanair),"
Borghezio was quoted as saying, by the ANSA news agency.
  
The photograph of Bossi, whose party wants devolution of powers to
Italy's regions, was taken last Sunday at a political conference in
which he hit out at a line in the national anthem which appears to

say Italy is the slave to Rome.
  
"Never again slaves to Rome," the minister said, raising his

The gesture triggered condemnation from opposition politicians,
some of whom asked Bossi to resign, but also embarrassment from other
members of the conservative coalition that makes up Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi's government.
  
Berlusconi said later he had met with Bossi to discuss the matter
and that it had been "resolved."
  
Like Berlusconi, Bossi strongly opposed a plan earlier this year
by the previous centre-left government to sell the financially-
troubled Alitalia to French-Dutch airline Air France-KLM. Air France-
KLM subsequently withdrew its bid.
  
Ryanair and other airlines allege that the Italian state's support
for Alitalia amounts to unfair competition in contravention of
European Union laws.

DPA FINANCE Britain Aviation  Easyjet says rising fuel costs to hit profits and capacity London   
British budget airline Easyjet warned Thursday that
rising fuel costs would result in significantly lower annual profits
which it hoped to offset by cutting flights over the winter months.
  
Easyjet said its annual fuel costs have increased by about 185
million pounds (370 million dollars), as analysts predicted that the
company's full-year earnings would be less than expected.
  
It predicted that annual profits could be up to 42 per cent lower
than in the previous financial year.
  
That would leave the airline with pretax profits of around 120
million pounds for the year to the end of September, compared with
191 million for the last year.
  
While Easyjet would attempt to offset more than 50 per cent of the
additional fuel costs through revenues growth and cost savings, there
would be a 12-per cent reduction in capacity from London's Stansted
airport this winter.
  
Earlier this month, rival airline Ryanair said it would cut about
250 flights from Stansted this winter in an attempt to offset fuel
costs.

DPA FINANCE EU Transport Aviation Denmark  Brussels: Danish report confirms airline website problems 
Brussels/Copenhagen   
Airlines such as Ryanair, Air Berlin
and Aer Lingus are still not giving customers full information on
their online ticket offers, the European Union's executive said
Thursday in the wake of a Danish consumer report.
  
"Europe's consumers are being let down by the airline industry.
There are serious and persistent problems with ticket sales
throughout the airline industry as a whole," EU Consumer Affairs
Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said in a statement.
  
Her comments followed a report from the Danish consumer ombudsman
in which six airline websites and one ticketing website were
highlighted as giving consumers either misleading price information
or unfair contract terms.
  
"When the consumer ombudsman recently checked the information
and/or procedures used, the following sites still contained incorrect
information and/or made use of misleading booking
procedures: Ryanair, Air Berlin, Air Baltic, SkyEurope, Aer Lingus,
Brussels Airlines and Seat24," the ombudsman's website announced.
  
However, five other airlines and sales websites have already
changed their sites to present accurate information, while one
airline has stopped flying to Denmark, the website said.
  
Ryanair and Air Berlin reject the claim that their websites are
misleading, European Commission spokeswoman Helen Kearns said.
  
The Danish site warns consumers to make sure that the first price
they see includes all taxes and fees, and that the site does not
feature pre-ticked boxes which they have to un-tick to avoid buying
extra services such as travel insurance.
Brussels: Danish report confirms airline website problems
  
The announcement comes as part of an EU-wide sweep of airline
websites aimed at cracking down on misleading and unfair information.
Few other member states have yet published the names of suspects, as
this would not be compatible with their legal systems.

Ireland hosts over 100 festivals this summer =
  
Dublin (dpa) - More than 100 arts festivals focusing on
storytelling, organ playing, carillon festivals, travel writing,
sculpture and other themes will be held from June to September across
Ireland this summer, the Arts Council recently announced in Dublin.
  
The burst in creativity is due in part to an investment of 5
million euro (8 million dollars) by the Arts Council during that
period.
  
Chairwoman Olive Braiden said: "Festivals are the heart and soul
of the Irish summer and the Arts Council is very proud of its role in
funding these. They play a central part in or lives, a vital role in
our economy and are also a key attraction for our tourists."

DPA FINANCE Europe Business Aviation  European airlines feeling the pinch, passenger figures show Brussels   
More and more European flights are departing with
empty seats as the continent's major airlines continue to feel the
pinch of the economic slowdown, the credit crunch and rising fuel
prices, figures out Tuesday show.
  
According to the latest data from the Association of European
Airlines (AEA), airline traffic in April was up just 1 per cent from
the same month last year. More significantly, the carriers' load
factor was down by an "alarming" 2.7 points over the same period.
  
The drop translates into a load factor of 74.8 per cent, meaning
that the average European flight departs with a quarter of its seats
empty.
  
"Clearly, economic conditions are taking their toll in the
marketplace as the global slowdown and the credit crunch impact
business confidence and travel volumes, while resurgent inflation is
severely affecting discretionary income," the AEA said in a
statement.
  
The AEA report showed that the worst affected routes in April, in
terms of traffic, were the domestic and North Atlantic routes.
  
The previously booming cross-border European market, by contrast,
registered a modest growth of just 1.9 per cent while traffic towards
North Africa and the Middle East was up 4.5 and 5.2 per cent
respectively.
  
In the period between January to April 2008, overall passenger
rates were up 2.6 per cent when compared to the same period last
year. But the key passenger load factor was down by an aggregate 1.4
points to 73.5 per cent.
  
European airlines feeling the pinch, passenger figures show
Looking at the performance of individual airlines, beleaguered
Alitalia suffered the biggest drop in terms of passengers (-25.9 per
cent when compared to April 2007), with its passenger load factor
falling by 9.7 points.
  
The association, which groups 33 major European carriers - from
Air France to Virgin Atlantic Airways - noted that many airlines were
increasing ticket prices to mitigate soaring fuel costs and planned
to make "substantial capacity cutbacks" after the summer.
  
Irish budget airline Ryanair, which is not a member of the AEA,
also warned Tuesday that it would have to raise ticket prices and
ground part of its fleet in the coming months.

DPA FINANCE Britain Business Aviation  Ryanair reports 2008 profit rise despite high fuel costs London   
Budget airline Ryanair Tuesday reported annual pre-
tax profits of 419 million pounds (820 million dollars) but warned
that ticket prices would have to rise to meet soaring fuel costs and
charges.
  
The Irish budget carrier said it would not impose a fuel
surcharge. But chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline would
ground up to 10 per cent of its fleet this winter to combat rising
airport charges.
  
The pre-tax profits up to the end of March 2008 represent a rise
of 17 per cent over the previous year.
  
O'Leary said the rising oil price had been mitigated through bulk
buying at cheaper prices. But if fuel costs remained high, ticket
prices would have to rise by about 5 per cent.
  
Results for 2008-09 would depend entirely on fuel costs, but if
they stayed at present levels, Ryanair would probably only break even
in 2009, he predicted.
  
Ryanair carried 50.9 million passengers during the past year, 20
per cent more than the previous year.
  
"No airline is better placed in Europe than Ryanair to trade
through this downturn," O'Leary said.

DPA FINANCE EU Transport Airlines  EU airlines given one year to make websites honest Brussels   
The European Union's top consumer-affairs
official on Thursday gave EU airlines one year to make their websites
honest after a study revealed "appalling" levels of deceptive offers
and a weaker than expected ability to change them.
  
The airlines involved include low-cost giant Ryanair and Austria's
national carrier, Austrian, as well as around 70 other airlines and
travel companies, officials in Brussels said.
  
"I intend to wrap this sweep investigation up by May 2009. ...
Until I see the market really clean from the point of view of
consumers, I will not stop my efforts," EU Consumer Protection
Commissioner Meglena Kuneva told journalists.
  
"If we need to have more measures, I won't hesitate to go
further," sanctioning offenders as necessary, she warned.
  
At the very least, the airlines should provide clear information
on the final price which customers will be charged for their ticket
and the availability of the price band in question, and make sure
that customers are not automatically registered for costly
"optional" services, Kuneva said.
  
In September, consumer officials in 15 EU member states and Norway
analyzed the websites of airlines and ticketing agencies in their
countries to see whether they presented users with an accurate
account of what their tickets would cost.
  
Kuneva said she was "frankly appalled" by the result, which
revealed that 137 of the 386 sites checked broke EU consumer laws by
either advertising the ticket at a price which was below the final
one, failing to provide appropriate contract information or only
applying the advertised low price to a tiny number of seats.
EU airlines given one year to make websites honest
  
Since then, national enforcement agencies have forced around half
of the websites to follow the rules or shut down, Kuneva said.
  
But only 12 per cent of the problems associated with companies not
based in the country where the flawed websites were discovered have
been resolved, she said.
  
"We need to track down and follow the about 70 remaining cases
which we detected as bad and false. They need to be either amended or
shut down - and we have the right to do so," she said.
  
Most of the countries which took part in the September sweep have
not disclosed the names of the companies involved, saying that they
must first finish their own legal proceedings.
  
But Norway and Sweden have both published the names of the
companies their sweep caught out.
  
Sweden's sweep found flaws in the websites of Irish giant Ryanair
and local carriers Gotlandsflyg and Ryanair. Norway's sweep also
found flaws in Ryanair's site, together with those of Austrian and
Finland's Blue 1 airline.
  
Blue 1 and Austrian have since amended the offending practices,
while Ryanair has been asked to do so, a statement from the Norwegian
Consumer Ombudsman's office said.

DPA FINANCE EU Justice Aviation Ireland  European Court rejects Aer Lingus appeal over Ryanair 
shareholding Brussels   
The European Court on Wednesday refused to block
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair from using its voting rights in rival
Aer Lingus, in the latest twist to a vicious takeover battle.
  
"Aer Lingus has failed to fulfil the conditions required for
interim relief," which would block Ryanair's use of its voting
rights, because it has not proved that the use of such rights would
cause Aer Lingus irreparable damage, the President of the European
Court of First Instance Marc Jaeger ruled.
  
Aer Lingus' argument that Ryanair's acquisition of 29.4 per cent
of its shares means that it has already implemented an illegal
takeover "cannot be considered" as valid, Jaeger ruled.
  
The legal battle dates back to 2006, when the Irish government
decided to privatize the formerly state-owned Aer Lingus. On October
23 of that year, Ryanair launched a bid to buy the entire company.
  
But on June 27, 2007, the European Commission - the body charged
with policing the European Union's single market - decided that the
takeover would break EU competition rules, and banned it.
  
Ryanair challenged that decision in the European Court. It
continued to buy shares in Aer Lingus, which responded by asking the
court to make Ryanair sell its shares, and block it from using its
voting rights until the case had been concluded.
  
Wednesday's decision deals only with the temporary block on the
use of voting rights.
  
Ryanair's challenge of the commission decision, and Aer Lingus'
demand that Ryanair be forced to sell the shares, are both still
European Court rejects Aer Lingus appeal over Ryanair shareholding

Court officials say that the average time which a case can last is

DPA x France Media Sarkozy  Paris public transport bans ad critical of Sarkozy Paris   
The advertising section of the RATP public transport
network serving the greater Paris area has banned an advertising
poster for a weekly magazine that suggests President Nicolas Sarkozy
is mentally ill, the news web site Rue89 reported Friday.
  
According to the report, Metrobus - which controls the ads that
appear in the buses, metros and trains serving the capital and its
suburbs - rejected two versions of the ad for the weekly Courrier
International.
  
Both ads show the cover of the magazine's new issue, with the
headline on one reading "Madrid's View: Sarkozy Is a Seriously Ill
Person."
  
When that was turned down by Metrobus, the magazine offered
another version, with the headline "Madrid's View: Sarkozy - Sick
with Ego," which was also refused.
  
The headlines referred to four stories produced for the magazine
by the daily El Pais, whose assistant editor-in-chief Lluis Bassets
wrote one of the articles.
  
In it, he writes: "The illness from which Sarkozy suffers is not
as serious as (former French President Francois) Mitterand's prostate
cancer, but it affects that vital organ, the ego, which suffers from
a hypertrophy that is probably irreversible."
  
Rue89 suggested that the refusal by Metrobus to run the ads could
be linked to the recent decisions by Sarkozy to go to court against
ads and stories that displeased him.
  
In January he and his then-fiancee Carla Bruni sued low-cost
carrier Ryanair for using their images without permission.
  
He later filed criminal charges against the web site of the weekly
Paris public transport bans ad critical of Sarkozy
le Nouvel Observateur for running a story claiming that he had sent
an SMS to his former wife one week before he married Bruni that read:
"Come back and I'll cancel everything."

French President Nicolas Sarkozy has filed a
criminal complaint against the website of the left-wing weekly Le
Nouvel Observateur for publishing an SMS message he supposedly sent
to his ex-wife a few days before his marriage to Carla Bruni, French
media reported Friday.
  
The message to his former wife, Cecilia, read: "If you come back,
I'll cancel everything," a supposed allusion to his wedding with the
former supermodel, which took place on February 2. Sarkozy's divorce
from Cecilia was announced in October.
  
According to Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, "The message is
fake, an alteration of reality." Therefore the president is charging
the website with forgery, use of a forged document and possession of
a forged document, offences liable to a sentence of up to three years
in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros (65,250 dollars).
  
According to the daily Le Figaro, this marks the first time a
French head of state has filed criminal charges against a news organ.
  
Earlier this month, a Paris court ruled in favour of a lawsuit
brought by Sarkozy and Bruni against low-cost carrier Ryanair for
using a photograph of the couple without their consent in a newspaper

A Paris court on Tuesday ruled in favour of French
President Nicolas Sarkozy and his new wife, singer Carla Bruni, in
their lawsuit against low-cost carrier Ryanair over an ad that used a
photograph of the couple without their consent, French radio
reported.
  
The court granted Sarkozy's demand for 1 euro (1.48 dollars) in
damages and interest for infringement on the rights of his image for
the purpose of advertising.
  
However, Bruni was awarded only 60,000 euros instead of the
500,000 euros she had demanded because of her prior work as one of
the world's highest-paid models.
  
The court found that the ad had caused "property and moral damage"
to the couple, and prohibited Ryanair from running it again.
  
The ad appeared last week in the daily Le Parisien and depicted
Sarkozy and Bruni smiling, with a thought balloon superimposed above
Bruni's head saying, "With Ryanair my entire family can come to my
wedding."
  
In a way, the ad was prophetic, for the 53-year-old French
president and Bruni, 40, tied the knot just several days later, on
Saturday.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Aviation  Ryanair predicts "perfect storm" as profits dip by almost a third London   
Leading budget airline Ryanair Monday reported a
27-per cent dip in profits in the last quarter of 2007 and predicted
a "perfect storm" in the European airline sector hit by higher oil
prices and weaker consumer demand.
  
The Irish no-frills carrier said it made an adjusted after-tax
profit of 26 million pounds (51.4 million dollars) between October
and the end of December 2007, which is 27 per cent less than during
the same period in 2006.
  
Presenting the figures, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary
warned that the European airline sector was facing the possibility of
a "perfect storm" of higher oil prices, poor consumer demand, a
weaker pound sterling and higher airport costs.
  
Profits in the coming financial year, starting in April, could
fall by as much as 50 per cent.
  
Ryanair, which has not introduced a fuel surcharge, was
"essentially unhedged" against rising oil costs, O'Leary said.
  
But he pledged that the airline would continue to slash prices.
  
"There can be only one competitive response to any consumer
uncertainty and that is for Ryanair to slash fares and yields,
stimulate traffic, encourage price-sensitive consumers, and promote
new routes and base developments."
  
Ryanair, which flies to 26 European countries, reported that
revenue had increased by 16 per cent to 426 million pounds in the
last quarter of 2007 and passenger numbers had risen by 21 per cent
to 12.4 million.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Aviation  ROUNDUP: Ryanair expects further profit dip but hails "recession" London   
Europe's leading budget carrier Ryanair fears that
profits could be halved this year amid predictions that airlines will
fly into a "perfect storm" of relentlessly rising oil prices and
weaker consumer demand.
  
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, making the predictions
Monday, said the Dublin-based airline suffered a 27-per cent dip in
profits in the last quarter of 2007, leaving it with an adjusted
after-tax profit of 26 million pounds (51.4 million dollars).
  
Profits in the coming financial year, starting in April, could
fall by as much as 50 per cent, said O'Leary. But he insisted that
Ryanair, which has not introduced a fuel surcharge, would continue to
slash prices for customers.
  
In this context, O'Leary welcomed the prospect of a possible
recession in Britain, saying that Ryanair would help people "fly even
through a recession" by keeping prices low.
  
"I don't know why we are trying to avert a recession. We need a
recession. I think it would be great for the aviation industry," the
controversial self-made airline boss said.
  
He argued that an economic recession would "get rid of
environmental taxes and a lot of the environmental nonsense" talked
about in relation to aviation.
  
"We would welcome a good, deep recession for 12 to 18 months,"
said O'Leary, adding that he did not believe that people would cut
back on flying during such a period of belt-tightening.
  
Ryanair hoped to increase annual passenger levels by 19 per cent
to 50 million in 2008, he predicted, rising as high as 83 million by
ROUNDUP: Ryanair expects further profit dip but hails "recession"
2012 and doubling profits.
  
The budget carrier would "never" introduce fuel surcharges, vowed
O'Leary, while urging passengers to "stop grumbling" about the
much-criticized rise in extra-charges for airport check-ins and
check-in luggage.
  
Those charged would go up "until people chose to fly with carry-on
bags only.
  
Revenue from the so-called "ancillary charges" rose by 30 per to
83.4 million pounds in the last quarter of 2007, in line with
Ryanair's aim to generate 20 per cent of its revenues from the
charges within 3 years.
  
Ryanair, which flies to 26 European countries, reported that
revenue had increased by 16 per cent to 426 million pounds in the
last quarter of 2007 and passenger numbers had risen by 21 per cent
to 12.4 million.
  
Revenues were up 16 per cent to 427.1 million pounds in the last
quarter of 2007.
  
Presenting the figures, O'Leary warned that the European airline
sector was facing the possibility of a "perfect storm" of higher oil
prices, poor consumer demand, a weaker pound sterling and higher
airport costs.
  
He admitted that Ryanair was "essentially unhedged" against rising
oil costs, but was confident that the airline could remain
competitive through its price-cutting policy.
  
"There can be only one competitive response to any consumer
uncertainty and that is for Ryanair to slash fares and yields,
stimulate traffic, encourage price-sensitive consumers, and promote
new routes and base developments."

An attorney for French President Nicolas Sarkozy on
Wednesday filed two lawsuits against low-cost carrier Ryanair over an
ad that uses a photograph of him and his girlfriend, singer Carla
Bruni, the website of the daily le Monde reported.
  
For infringement on the rights of his image without consent and
for the purpose of advertising, Sarkozy has demanded one euro (1.47
dollars) in damages and interest and an injunction against the
commercialization of his image. Bruni is asking for a payment of
500,000 euros against eventual future damages and interest.
  
Sarkozy's attorney, Thierry Herzog, said that Bruni's demand was
based on her work as a model.
  
"She has advertising contracts with brands that pay her a great
deal to represent them," he said. "A photo of Carla Bruni, that's
500,000 euros."
  
The ad appeared earlier this week in the daily Le Parisien and
depicts Sarkozy and Bruni smiling, with a thought balloon
superimposed above Bruni's head saying, "With Ryanair my entire
family can come to my wedding."
  
According to media reports, Sarkozy, who turned 53 on Monday, and
the 40-year-old Bruni could tie the knot in February.

Irish carrier Aer Lingus opened its new

year-old link between Shannon in the west of Ireland and the British
capital, Ireland's national broadcaster RTE reported.
  
Aer Lingus is going head-to-head on the Belfast-London route with
Ryanair, EasyJet, BMI, Flybe and CityJet, giving passengers a total
of eight possible routes to London from Belfast's two airports, the
international and George Best Belfast City Airport.
  
Aer Lingus will operate three flights a day to Heathrow from
Belfast.
  
Aer Lingus said it was on course to carry 500,000 passengers in
the first year on all routes to and from Belfast, RTE radio reported,
but it quoted the airline's chief executive Dermot Mannion as saying
competition would be fierce.
  
Aer Lingus launched flights from Belfast International Airport to
Barcelona and Amsterdam on December 10 as part of a 100-million-pound
(223-million-dollar) investment in Northern Ireland, creating 100
jobs.
  
Flights to Geneva were added on December 11, and there are plans
to introduce flights from Belfast to Budapest, Malaga, Rome, Faro and
Nice before the spring.
  
The shift of Aer Lingus' London Heathrow flights from Shannon to
the British-administered northern part of Ireland has been

DPA FINANCE Britain Aviation  One-bag rule for air travellers lifted at most British airports London   
The much-loathed "one-bag rule" for hand luggage
was lifted at most British airports Monday amid fresh confusion over
which airports and which airlines were participating in the scheme.
  
London's main Heathrow airport joined more than 20 others around
the country in lifting the restrictions, but Gatwick, London's second
airport, will continue to stick to allowing only one bag onboard.
  
The two main budget airlines, Ryanair and easyJet, are also not
reverting to the two-bag rule, suspended after a major terror threat
to transatlantic air traffic in August, 2006.
  
Britain was the only European country that followed the US in
introducing the hand luggage restriction. However, a limit on liquids
that can be taken onboard remains.
  
Gatwick, where security concerns and lacking technology have
prevented a relaxation, is seeking to tackle the problem by allowing
two bags for connecting passengers passing through and a one-bag
regulation for everyone else.
  
Airports where the restriction was lifted today included Stansted,
Glasgow, Manchester and Cardiff. But Gatwick, Luton, Leeds and
Liverpool are among those sticking to the one-bag rule.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair was reported
Monday to have agreed to pay damages to former Swedish prime minister
Goran Persson and a former Swedish foreign minister.
  
Persson and Laila Freivalds sued the no-frills carrier in 2006
after their names and images were used in an advertisement without
their prior consent.
  
The ad carried the text "Time to flee the country."
  
The two ex-politicians were roundly criticized for the former
Swedish government's slow response to the December 2004 tsunami
disaster that claimed the lives of hundreds of Swedish nationals.
  
A court date was planned for Tuesday but after a recent out of
court settlement the case has been dropped, the online news site
Realtid.se reported.
  
Persson and Freivalds had initially demanded 150,000 kronor
(23,000 dollars) but settled for half the sum. They planned to donate
the funds to charity, the report said.
  
Persson left politics earlier this year. Freivalds resigned in
February 2006 over her role in shutting down the website of a right-
wing group that planned to publish controversial cartoons of the
Prophet Mohammed.

dateline, releads with comments from KLM, details Rome/Amsterdam   
Alitalia has not yet responded to a
takeover bid by French-Dutch carrier AirFrance-KLM, KLM Managing
Director Peter Hartman told reporters on Wednesday.
  
On December 6, the AirFrance-KLM made a non-binding takeover bid
for Italy's struggling national carrier. No financial details were
released.
  
Italy's second largest airline AirOne and a group of Italian
investors headed by the former chairman of Italy's state broadcaster
RAI also made takeover bids last Thursday.
  
Hartman said KLM expects Alitalia to notify all bidders before the
end of the month of which is selected to negotiate the takeover.
Italian Transport Minister Alessandro Bianchi on Wednesday,
meanwhile, said the announcement of the winning bid would be made
Thursday after a meeting of Alitalia's board.
  
Bianchi said the Italian government was due later Wednesday to
examine offers to by the state's controlling stake of 49.9 per cent
in Alitalia.
  
"Today we will look at the offers presented and we will decide,"
Bianchi said in a radio interview.
  
"An important country such as ours can't do without a carrier of
reference," Bianchi told private broadcaster Radio 24.
  
Hartman, meanwhile stressed he did not expect the European
Commission to block a possible takeover of Alitalia by AirFrance-KLM.
  
"The alternative is Alitalia's bankruptcy," he explained. "The
ROUNDUP: Alitalia yet to respond to takeover bid
European Commission does not want that."
  
Last Thursday, Europe's largest low-fare airline Ryanair requested
the European Commission to block Air France-KLM's bid for Alitalia
until both airlines have paid back 2.7 billion euros (3.94 billion
dollars) in what it calls "illegal aid" from the French and Italian
governments.
  
Alitalia has been in financial distress for many years. In the
third quarter of this year, the company suffered a loss of 58 million
euros (85 million dollars) before taxes.
  
AirFrance-KLM in a non-binding, so-called Letter of Interest
issued when it presented its bid last week, set out all the benefits
a merger between the companies could bring for both sides.
  
On Tuesday AirFrance-KLM CEO Jean-Cyril Spinetta said his company
did not plan to convert Alitalia into a regional carrier, a concern
raised by many Italian political and business leaders.
  
Fears have also been expressed that AirFrance-KLM may wish to
concentrate activity only at Rome's Fiumicino airport, downsizing
operations at Milan's Malpensa hub - a move which could result in
thousands of job cuts.
  
While few details of the offers have been made public, AirOne -
which is backed in its bid by Italy's largest bank IntesaSanpaolo -
has indicated it would cut some 3,700 Alitalia jobs.
  
Unions have staunchly opposed any privatization plan that would
require major job cuts and the government's previous bid to sell its
Alitalia stake through an auction collapsed in July after potential
buyers rejected conditions including a limit on the number of lay-
offs.

A number of European airlines could be forced to
close their websites after a European-wide sweep found wide-ranging
violations in the way ticket prices and sales conditions are
advertised.
  
The sweep, whose results are due to be published by the European
Commission on Wednesday, was carried out in 15 European Union member
states and in Norway, between September 24 and September 28.
  
A total of 447 websites were checked for misleading or deceptive
information about flight tickets. Of these, 226 showed
irregularities.
  
Common violations of EU rules include airport taxes and additional
fees not being immediately included in the price of the ticket and
the promotion of ultra-cheap or even free tickets that are not in
fact available when a consumer wants to buy one.
  
Other common irregularities involved insurance or other additional
services boxes being ticked "yes" by default and the failure to
provide customers with complete information about cancellation
procedures.
  
Of the 48 websites checked in Belgium, 46 were found to violate an
EU directive banning misleading advertisement.
  
Denmark came second with 25 violations out of 62 websites checked
while no irregularities were found among the 20 websites checked in
Austria.
  
The airlines have been given four months to respond. If they do
not fix the problems, they will be named and shamed by the
Commission.

The Dublin-based airline predicted that full-year net profits were

DPA FINANCE CEE Business Airports  NEWS FEATURE: Battle takes shape for Central Europe's airport hub  
Andrew McCathie, dpa Berlin   
Fast-paced economic growth, a surge in airline
traffic and a dramatic expansion of budget airline services have
combined to help trigger a race among airports to emerge as the key
regional hub for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).
  
With a new growing sense of prosperity and rising wages across CEE
countries, airport operators in major cities in and round the region
have been moving to upgrade their facilities and in some cases re-
establish links with the CEE aviation industry.
  
Indeed, airports including Warsaw, Prague, Vienna and Berlin have
been attempting to position themselves to cash in on the opening up
of the skies over the CEE region as travellers abandon the other,
often run-down, transport systems such as roads to exert even more
pressure on the burgeoning airline sector.
  
In the meantime, both Vienna and Prague appear to have stolen the
march on both Warsaw and Berlin, which have been struggling to press
on with their plans for launching major makeovers of their airport
facilities.
  
On Monday Poland's state airports operator PPL said it was
cancelling a contract with a Spanish-Polish construction consortium
for the expansion of Warsaw's airport after a series of delays in
completing the building work for a second terminal.
  
"Since April 30 when, under the contract, the departure hall
should have started receiving passengers, the consortium has declared
repeatedly that the northern piers and departure hall would be ready
to open," PPL said in a statement.
  
NEWS FEATURE: Battle takes shape for Central Europe's airport hub
As a sign of the sense of urgency surrounding the building of the
new terminal in Warsaw, air passenger traffic in Poland has in recent
years being growing at about 30 per cent.
  
With Central Europe also rapidly emerging as a major tourist
destination, the growth of budget airline operators in the CEE means
that for parts of the region cheap carriers are essentially taking
over from scheduled operators.
  
Europe's leading no-frills carrier Ryanair has just launched seven
new services from Budapest starting next month as a result helping to
give a new impetus to tourism in the Hungarian capital.
  
There are currently about eight low-cost carriers jetting into
airports in Central Europe.
  
In the case of Berlin's vast new 620-million-euro international
airport, authorities in the German capital have expressed confidence
that the airport will open on time in October 2011.
  
This is despite a series of hiccups and delays in the airport's
development including a move this month to reopen the tender for the
terminal building.
  
Once complete, the Berlin airport operators plan to focus on
markets in both Asia and Central Europe arguing that the German
capital's airport is closer than airports in other parts of western
Europe.
  
But reflecting its ambitions to become a new transit link between
Eastern and Western Europe, Vienna airport operator Flughafen Wien AG
said last week that the number of passengers that passed through its
doors last month jumped 10.7 per cent year-on-year following a 10.5-
per-cent rise in August.
  
At the same time, Prague airport, which is due to be privatized
next year, recorded an almost 10-per-cent surge in earnings during
the first half of this year with revenues growing 6.6 per cent and
passenger numbers racing ahead by nine per cent to 5.58 million.
  
"We expect the number of passengers to exceed 12 million by the
end of the year," the airport's general director Miroslav Dvorak
said, with the sell-off of the airport expected to generate between
70 billion koruna (3.3 billion dollars) and 100 billion koruna.
  
Some 1.2 million people used the airport in July alone, which is
about the same number of people who live in the Czech capital. The
airport is hoping to handle 20 million passengers by 2020.
  
Prague airport's success has helped to transform the airport into
one of Europe's busiest and follows the opening of a new terminal
last year to handle essentially western European passengers following
the expansion of its facilities.
  
Spanish flag carrier Iberia last month announced a string of new
services connecting Prague to Latin America.

epa file photos 401137852, 401137853 available Dublin/London   
Dr Tony Ryan, the Irish entrepreneur and
founder of low-cost airline Ryanair, who has died aged 71, was
hailed Thursday for revolutionizing air travel by pioneering the
European low-cost airline industry.
  
A statement from his family said Ryan passed away at his home in
Celbridge, County Kildare, after a long illness Wednesday afternoon.
  
"We are proud of Tony's many achievements, of his spirit of
entrepreneurship which created enterprise and opportunity for many
people in this country and abroad," a statement from his family said.
  
Ryan, the son of a train driver, was born on February 2, 1936, in
Thurles, County Tipperary, where he started his first job in a sugar
factory after leaving school.
  
He worked as a baggage handler for former state airline Aer Lingus
in the 1950s before setting up his own leasing company, Guinness Peat
Aviation (GPA), with one aircraft, in 1975.
  
Over the next 15 years, GPA grew to become the largest aircraft
leasing company in the world with assets under management of 7.5
billion dollars, according to the London Times Thursday.
  
The company collapsed after a botched flotation attempt in 1992,
and was eventually acquired by finance firm GE Capital.
  
Ryanair, which he co-founded in 1985, was initially an equally
daunting challenge, starting with one small aircraft flying to
Britain from Waterford in Ireland's south-east.
  
Under chief executive Michael O'Leary, hired by Ryan as his
OBITUARY: Tony Ryan: Irish entrepreneur who revolutionized air travel
right-hand man, the no-frills airline has grown to be the biggest in
Europe, carrying 50 million passengers a year with a pre-tax profit
of 401 million euros (542 million dollars) in the last financial
year.
  
O'Leary described Ryan as "one of the greatest Irishmen of the 20th
century" who would leave an "astonishing legacy."
  
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Ryan's contribution to the
"development of aviation in Ireland and indeed globally was immense."
  
"The establishment of Ryanair and its subsequent rise to become
one of the leading carriers in Europe is one of the greatest Irish
success stories and will be rightly regarded as perhaps his greatest
legacy."
  
"He possessed an extraordinary vision. Whether it was airline
investment in Asia, vineyards in Europe or bloodstock in the US, he
brought a tremendous sense of style, charm and good humour to all of
his business and personal relationships," Ryanair chairman David
Bonderman said about Ryan.
  
The airline's rocketing success since its stock market flotation
in 1997, and the revolution in cheap air travel, enabled Ryan to
invest in airline ventures in China and Latin America.
  
However, there was "nothing no-frills" about Ryan's own lifestyle,
as the Financial Times pointed out Thursday.
  
Ryan owned properties across the globe, art collections and
racehorse studs and became one of Ireland's biggest philanthropists
and supporters of the arts.
  
He had amassed a considerable fortune, estimated at 1.2 billion
euros, and lived partly in Monaco in tax exile.
  
Last year, he provided 10 million euros for a business school in
Dublin named after him.
  
"His legacy is clearly evident today as Ireland remains one of the

DPA FINANCE Ireland Business Aviation  Aer Lingus reports 42-per-cent drop in half-year profits Dublin   
Irish carrier Aer Lingus reported a decrease in
pre-tax profits of 42 per cent to 11.5 million euros (15.7 million
dollars) between January and June compared to the first half of 2006
due to increased costs, national broadcaster RTE reported Thursday.
  
The profit slump was caused by higher prices for fuel, airport
charges and personnel, RTE said, citing the company.
  
The airline is embroiled in a dispute over its decision to set up
a hub in the Northern Irish capital Belfast by moving its London
Heathrow slots from Shannon airport in Ireland's mid-west.
  
The move has angered Aer Lingus' pilots and staff, who claim the
pay and conditions in Belfast are less favourable. They fear Aer
Lingus could try to extend these terms across the whole company and
have threatened industrial action.
  
A strike called by pilots last week that was averted at the
eleventh hour has already cost Aer Lingus 3.5 million euros, while
defending against a takeover bid by rival Irish low-cost carrier
Ryanair has cost 8 million euros.
  
Fuel cost 28 per cent more at 116 million euros in the first half
of 2007 compared with 2006, salaries increased 12 per cent to 150
million euros with 220 extra staff and airport charges went up 4.3
per cent, RTE reported.
  
Passenger number increased 6 per cent during the first six months
of 2007 and sales increased by 47 million euros to almost 500 million
euros, RTE reported.

DPA x Europe Tourism Ireland  FEATURE: Destination no longer matters with cheap flight revolution  Gaby 
Mahlberg, dpa Dublin   
The destination doesn't matter that much as long as
the flight is cheap. Several mouse-clicks on an internet site will
book you a flight, travel insurance and even a hotel. It's so easy
that we fly more and we fly more often. The low-cost airline
revolution has changed the way we travel.
  
"We go for the city break destinations, anything that's easy to
reach from Cork Airport," Fionan Sheenan, 25, says as he is having a
pint with his friends at the airport bar in the southern Irish city
of Cork.
  
Fionan and his friends are on their way to a drink-fuelled stag
weekend in Liverpool. He says they would usually be willing to spend
up to 250 euros (345 dollars) on a return flight and calculates that
they might spend another 500 euros each in Liverpool, where they will
be staying for two nights.
  
The 500 euros will pay for beer, but also - well - "other
services," one slightly inebriated member of the group says with a
cheeky grin.
  
The friends have already been away for stag weekends at a number
of different destinations, including Munich, Prague, Amsterdam,
Edinburgh, Cardiff and Marbella.
  
Since 2000, the city break sector has grown massively, now
accounting for 38 per cent of all European outbound travel, as people
take shorter, more frequent trips, according to the World Travel
Trends Report 2006-7 compiled by international tourism consulting
group IPK.
  
Where people choose to travel is often quite random. Keith
FEATURE: Destination no longer matters with cheap flight revolution
O'Grady, 26, also waiting in Cork's airport bar to go on his own stag
weekend to Amsterdam, explains his choice in simple terms: "I haven't
been there yet."
  
Low-cost airlines are happy to provide for those who are willing
to try out something new. It's no longer just the capital cities
people are heading to.
  
"People go online and look for a cheap deal. They just go to
places they've never heard of or never been to and have a good time,"
Ryanair press officer Lorna Farren tells Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.
  
"City breaks have always been there, say to Paris or (Amsterdam)
Schipol. What is new is the locations," Farren says. It's no longer
just the classic destinations. "Now you can go to Bremen, Prague or
Barcelona," she adds.
  
The price is an important factor for the increase in air travel.
  
"Formerly, people couldn't afford to travel. The low-cost
revolution (in air travel) has made Europe a lot more accessible,"
Farren tells dpa.
  
"Flying used to be a preserve of the rich, now it's available to
all," she adds.
  
Not even concerns about pollution and global warming can put a
halt to the success of the airline, which expects to carry some 52
million passengers on 499 routes across Europe this year.
  
Dublin-based Ryanair was Europe's original low-fares airline and
is still its largest low-fares carrier, being voted Best Value
Airline in 1996 - the same year the European Union completed its Open
Skies deregulation, allowing airlines to compete freely across
Europe.
  
It all started in 1985 with a 15-seater aircraft, operating
between Waterford in the south-east of Ireland and London Gatwick.
  
In 1986 Ryanair obtained permission from the regulatory
authorities to challenge the fares of British Airways and Aer Lingus
on the Dublin-London route. With a return fare of 99 pounds (200
dollars), Ryanair more than halved its competitors' prices.
  
But the real low-fares revolution came in 1990, when Ryanair
completely restructured its operations. It moved to a single aircraft
fleet type, scrapped the free drinks and expensive meals on board and
reduced the lowest fares to 59 pounds return.
  
In 2007, the cheapest flights available only cost 1 euro cent
(just over 1 dollar cent) plus taxes and fees, and in May Ryanair
launched the world's first free seat giveaway, including taxes and
charges, for 1 million passengers.
  
Those who book quickly can get a real bargain.
  
Part of Ryanair's success is that it focuses on smaller regional
airports, Farren says. "We offer direct flights directly into holiday
regions, for instance in the south of France, and avoid the larger
crowded airports."
  
While this sounds great, many travellers might have been baffled
FEATURE: Destination no longer matters with cheap flight revolution
when they found themselves landing at one of the tiny airports that
in recent years have sprung up like mushrooms from the grounds of
disused military bases around Europe, kilometres away from their
final destination.
  
Thinking they might go to the regional capital Frankfurt in the
German state of Hesse for instance, they would have found themselves
stranded in the beautiful Hunsruck countryside in the state of
Rhineland Palatinate, nearly 2 hours away by coach.
  
Often, reaching one's final destination, it seems, is an adventure
in itself. But then again - it's cheap.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Business Aviation  Calls for Irish government to halt Aer Lingus pull-out from Shannon 
Dublin   
There were fresh calls Thursday on the Irish
government to intervene to stop the ending of Irish airline Aer
Lingus services between Shannon airport in Ireland's mid-west and
London's Heathrow Airport, Ireland's state broadcaster RTE reported.
  
Aer Lingus announced Tuesday that it would be ending the Shannon-
Heathrow link and replacing it with a new service between London's
Heathrow and Belfast International Airport, formerly known as
Aldergrove.
  
There is great concern in the mid-west Shannon region that the
switch would cause huge job losses and the loss of US investment
through Shannon.
  
Announcing the move, Aer Lingus said that Belfast represented an
opportunity for better growth and profits compared to Shannon, the
major hub for attracting international business to Ireland's rural
west.
  
The airline's plan, unveiled at a joint press conference with
leaders of the new power-sharing government in Northern Ireland,
means that Belfast will gain three flights daily to Heathrow,
Europe's busiest airport, starting in mid-January.
  
Ryanair, which has a 25-per-cent stake in Aer Lingus, and Shannon
Town Council have called on Ireland's Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to
explain why the company's landing slots at Heathrow were not
ring-fenced to prevent them being lost to Shannon.
  
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary called on Ahern to interrupt his
holidays in Kerry to explain why the government has not honoured its
promises that the Heathrow link would be maintained, RTE said.
Calls for Irish government to halt Aer Lingus pull-out from Shannon
  
O'Leary said Ryanair had committed to preserving the service last
year when it sought to acquire Aer Lingus, RTE reported.
  
The Mayor of Shannon, Councillor Sean McLoughlin, told RTE that
thousands of jobs and millions of euros in regional investment were
being threatened by "the nonsensical Aer Lingus decision" which would
have to be reversed.
  
Speaking after an emergency meeting of the Town Council Wednesday,
he said the former transport minister Martin Cullen had questions to
answer over the failure to ring-fence the landing slots.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Business Aviation  Ryanair reports increased profits despite rising costs London   
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Tuesday reported
profits of 138.9 million euros (188 million dollars) in the three
months up to the end of June.
  
Despite weaker demand, profit figures were 20-per-cent higher than
in the same period last year, Ryanair said.
  
Ancillary revenues - including excess baggage charges and travel
insurance - grew by 53 per cent to 117 million euros.
  
The airline predicted that passenger growth would slow this winter
due to a cutback in services from London's Stansted airport, its main
hub in Britain.
  
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary announced that the airline
would cut back flights from Stansted this winter because of
"appalling" services at the airport and spiralling costs resulting
from the doubling of airport charges in April.
  
The rise in charges meant that it was more profitable to ground
seven of its 40 aircraft this winter rather than fly them, O'Leary
said.
  
Services would be cut by nearly 20 per cent.
  
Airport operator BAA was providing "abject facilities at
extortionate prices," O'Leary said. The current service provided by
BAA at Stansted was "nothing short of appalling."
  
Ryanair predicted that passenger volumes would grow by around 18
per cent to 50 million instead of the 24-per-cent growth previously
expected.
  
Ryanair reports increased profits despite rising costs
The profit outlook for the whole year remained cautious, Ryanair
said.

DPA FINANCE EU Aviation Ireland  1ST LEAD: Brussels blocks Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus Brussels   
EU Commission regulators ruled Wednesday that
budget airline Ryanair would not be allowed to take over its Irish
rival, Aer Lingus, formerly owned by the state.
  
The deal would limit competition on the route as the two airlines
combined would control more than 80 per cent of all European flights
to and from Dublin airport, the European Commission said.
  
The EU Commission made its ruling Wednesday after a seven-month
investigation into competition on the route.
  
The Board of Aer Lingus welcomed the EU Commission's decision,
saying it was "good news for Aer Lingus and our customers."
  
John Sharman, Chairman of Aer Lingus told Irish state broadcaster
RTE that "the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite
the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of
consumers."
  
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, had said that he
expected the EC to block the 1.4-billion-euros (1.8 billion dollars)
deal on competition grounds.
  
Ryanair is expected to take a legal challenge against the
decision, RTE reported.
  
Last October, Michael O'Leary shocked the world of aviation when
he announced Ryanair wanted to take over Aer Lingus, and the Irish
government, which had privatised Aer Lingus two weeks earlier, was
particularly put out, according to RTE reports.
  
There is speculation on whether Ryanair would be forced to sell
its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.

DPA FINANCE EU Aviation Ireland  ROUNDUP: Brussels blocks Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus Brussels   
Budget airline Ryanair is to appeal the European
Commission's ruling Wednesday preventing it from taking over its
Irish rival, Aer Lingus, formerly owned by the state.
  
Aer Lingus has welcomed the commission's ruling that the merger
would have created a monopoly on the 35 routes operated by both
airlines, Irish state broadcaster RTE reported.
  
The deal would limit competition as the two airlines combined
would control more than 80 per cent of all European flights to and
from Dublin airport, the European Commission said.
  
John Sharman, Chairman of Aer Lingus told RTE that "the creation
of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of

investigation into competition on the route.
  
The Board of Aer Lingus welcomed the European Commission's
decision, saying it was "good news for Aer Lingus and our customers."
  
Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said the ruling would
lead to continued strong competition between the two airlines at
Dublin Airport.
  
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, had said that he
expected the EU to block the 1.4-billion-euros (1.8 billion dollars)
deal on competition grounds.
  
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, is expected to take a

DPA FINANCE Ireland Aviation  ROUNDUP: Ryanair posts record profits but warns of slowing growth 
Dublin/London   
Irish budget airline Ryanair Tuesday
announced record annual profits, lifted by higher ticket prices and
extra charges, of 401.4 million euros (542 million dollars) in the
12 months to the end of March.
However, the airline warned that after the 33-per-cent jump in
profits in the last financial year, growth was expected to slow by
about 5 per cent in the current financial year.
The news sent Ryanair's shares almost 6 per cent lower, as Ryanair
chief executive Michael O'Leary named higher airport taxes and duties
on passengers for the slowdown.
He urged shareholders to remain "cautious and conservative" and
accused the British government of "highway robbery" for doubling
passenger taxes in February.
He said that "swingeing price increases imposed at London's
Stansted airport, Ryanair's main base, where costs had doubled since
April," and higher air passenger duty (APD) were having a negative
impact on demand.
Despite the growing costs O'Leary predicted that Ryanair would
"lead and win every fare war in Europe."
He also singled out Ireland's Dublin airport for criticism, saying
that "unjustified price increases" there - as in Stansted - coincided
with substandard service and facilities.
Despite the problems, Ryanair had benefited from its decision to
start charging customers for every bag they check in, and for
services such as priority boarding.
ROUNDUP: Ryanair posts record profits but warns of slowing growth
Ryanair said its average fare per customer rose by 7 per cent over
the last financial year, while its total traffic figure climbed by 22
per cent to 42.5 million passengers.
The airline said its load factor - a measure of how well airlines
are filling planes - dropped by 1 per cent in the year to 82 per cent
and had fallen further in recent months.
Ryanair, which placed an order for 27 new Boeing aircraft last
week, said it was confident that traffic would grow to more than 52
million people in the current financial year.
But while vowing to continue its "price war" in the face of
growing opposition from other budget airlines, chiefly easyJet,
O'Leary said: "This remains an extremely volatile and cyclical
business."

Irish budget airline Ryanair Tuesday
announced record annual profits, lifted by higher ticket prices and
extra charges, of 401.4 million euros (542 million dollars) in the
12 months to the end of March, the airline said.
However, Ryanair warned that profit growth would slow in the
current year.
The company said that it expected profit growth to slow to about 5
per cent in the current financial year, and urged shareholders to
remain "cautious and conservative."
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary told BBC Radio Tuesday
that a number of factors had combined to slow earnings growth.
He said that "swingeing price increases imposed at London's
Stansted airport, where costs had doubled since April," and higher
air passenger duty (APD) were having a negative impact on demand.

Friday ordered the continued closure of the airport of Derry, in
Northern Ireland, on safety grounds.
A statement by the CAA in London, released after talks with the
Derry airport management, said the airport would remain closed until
a full audit was carried out.
The aerodrome would not re-open until next week. Earlier, the
airport management said it hoped that the "exceptional decision" to
suspend flights could be "reversed."
Flight operations at the airport were suspended at midnight
Thursday.
Among faults listed by Britain's airport regulator were poor
runway drainage, a lack of effective bird control and unsuitable
repairs to a section where planes are parked, according to a CAA
inspection report.
The airport is partly funded by the Irish Republic.
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair cancelled all flights to the
airport which serves Northern Ireland's second largest city of

Complaints about flight cancellations and delays at Irish airports
were much higher for Ryanair than any other airline, figures from the

Another Irish carrier, Aer Lingus, topped the list of complaints
for those being denied the right to get on a plane, the report said.
Some 36 per cent of flights leaving Dublin airport in 2006 were
operated by Ryanair, while Aer Lingus was responsible for 33 per cent
of flights.
A spokesman for the commission said that in a significant number

The head of Budapest Airport on Thursday welcomed
a decision by Irish budget carrier Ryanair to begin flights between
Hungary's capital and Britain.
"This is wonderful news," Stewart Wingate, the head of Budapest
Airport, said in a statement. "It shows the growth potential in the
Hungarian market."
Ryanair will operate four flights a week between Budapest and
Nottingham from October 31, adding to services it already operates
between Lake Balaton, one of Hungary's biggest tourist attractions,
and London.
Budapest Airport, the company that operates Ferihegy International
Airport, was privatized in December 2005.
Britain's BAA bought the airport. However, Spain's Ferrioval took
over the British company and this month sold Budapest Airport to
Germany's Hochtief for 1.9 billion euros.
The airport is one of the busiest in Central and Eastern Europe,
and this week announced it had handled over 700,000 passengers in
April, a 4.6 per cent increase on the previous year.
Both BAA and Hochtief promised to develop the airport into a major
regional hub, and Wingate said this work would continue.
"We are further working to bring more airlines, flights and
travellers to Budapest and to make Budapest Airport Central Europe's
most successful airport," he said.

A Ryanair jet made a non-scheduled landing in the
German city of Cologne during the night after a Polish passenger
pretended to have a bomb in his carry-on luggage, German police said
Wednesday.
The plane was flying from Luebeck, northern Germany, to Stansted
near London. The passenger, 22, had refused to switch off his
cellphone when asked to do so by the man seated next to him, and then
claimed he had a bomb.
The Irish plane was over Dutch territory at this time. Its pilot
issued an emergency radio call and diverted to Cologne, Germany.
Police arrested the passenger when the plane touched down shortly
before midnight, but found no bomb in his luggage. He was slightly
drunk and insisted he had been joking. Police freed him on bail on
the condition that he immediately return to Poland.
The jet resumed its journey after 2 hours on the ground. Police
said the passenger would be summoned later to answer German charges
of breaching the peace by threatening a crime.

Budget airline Ryanair Monday reported a
steep 30-per cent rise in quarterly profits as passenger numbers
increased by nearly 20 per cent.
  
The Dublin-based carrier said net profits jumped 30 per cent in
the third quarter of 2006 to 48 million euros (94 million dollars),
as average fares, including baggage charges, rose by 7 per cent.
  
Passenger numbers grew by 19 per cent, with 10.3 million customers
travelling with the airline in the three months to December 31, up
from 8.6 million in the previous year.
  
But fuel costs rose by 52 per cent in the period to 175 million
euros. Ryanair has not introduced a fuel surcharge.
  
The airline, which has clearly also profited from the delays and
troubles that have hit main carrier British Airways in the past few
months, said it now expected annual net profits to soar by around 29
per cent to 390 million euros.

DPA POLITICS Britain Transport Aviation Emissions  British government attacks airlines over emission curbs 
London   
The British Labour government Friday launched an
unusually strong attack on major airlines for refusing to take
climate change seriously.
  
Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Ian Pearson, state secretary
for the environment, described the attitude of major American
airlines to carbon emission reduction as "a disgrace."
  
Pearson stated that national carrier British Airways was "only
just about playing ball" in the fight to reduce carbon emissions, and
expressed anger at the refusal by Germany's Lufthansa airline to
accept market-based curbs.
  
But the state secretary, who is attached to the Ministry of the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), reserved his strongest
criticism for budget-carrier Ryanair, which he described as the
"irresponsible face of capitalism."
  
Pearson said he regards the predicted growth in airlines' carbon
emissions such a threat to the government's plans to cut emissions by
60 per cent by 2050 that he still wants the European Union to go
further - and faster - to include airline emissions in its carbon
trading scheme.
  
Before Christmas, the European Union (EU) proposed to include all
flights within Europe in the carbon trading scheme from 2011.
  
A year later, the scope would be expanded to cover all
international flights that arrive at or depart from an EU airport.
Foreign airlines from outside the EU would also be included.
  
Irish-based Ryanair is among the airlines who have vowed to
British government attacks airlines over emission curbs
boycott the scheme.
  
Its flamboyant chief executive, Michael O'Leary, Friday hit back
at Pearson, describing him as "foolish and ill-informed" and
maintaining that Ryanair was "Europe's greenest airline."

DPA x Britain Transport Aviation  Easyjet cancels flights from Bristol over "slippery" runway London   
British budget airline Easyjet Friday cancelled 18
flights at Bristol airport in south-west Britain after safety
concerns over a new runway, the airline said.
  
The no-frills carrier said it was concerned about the ability of
its planes to brake in wet weather after resurfacing work on the
runway at the airport.
  
"The runway conditions are slick at present and we are not
confident we can land our aircraft in wet weather without skidding,"
an Easyjet spokeswoman said.
  
Other airlines, including British Airways and Ryanair, have not
cancelled departures from Bristol. The airport has confirmed the
Easyjet cancellations, but declined to comment on the reasons given
by the airline.
  
Easyjet serves a number of regional destinations in Britain from
Bristol but also flies from there to cities in western and central
Europe, inclucing Spain, France, Poland and the Czech Republic.
  
Easyjet said the decision to cancel the flights had been
taken after extensive discussions with Bristol Airport and with the
Civil Aviation Authority.
  
Bristol International Airport undertook runway resurfacing plans
worth 17 million pounds (33 million dolars) last October.
  
In December, a plane operated by Aurigny, an airline based on the
Channel island of Guernsey, with 52 passengers on board, ended up in
the safety zone at the end of the runway after landing at Bristol.
  
An Easyjet flight from Malaga in Spain also recently strayed onto
the safety area at Bristol while taxiing.

DPA FINANCE Germany Business Aviation  INTERVIEW: Lufthansa low-cost airline posts profit - plans 
expansion  Leon Mangasarian, dpa Berlin   
Lufthansa's low-cost airline Germanwings is gearing
up for further expansion after posting its first profit just four
years after beginning operations, says Germanwings CEO Thomas
Winkelmann.
  
"Germanwings has just had the best year in its history," said an
ebullient Winkelmann over a lunch of wiener schnitzel at Berlin's
Cafe Einstein, a popular meeting place for movers and shakers in the
German capital.
  
Germanwings - which began operating in 2002 - is set to make a
profit this year, said Winkelmann who declined to reveal any figures.
  
Turnover rose to almost 560 million euros (737 million dollars) in
2006, compared with 400 million euros in the previous year, the
company says.
  
The number of passengers flown this year increased to 7.1 million,
up from 5.5 million in 2005.
  
Germanwings currently has 24 Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft. The
number of jets will expand to 27 in 2007 and all remaining A320s will
be retired. The airline hopes to enlarge its fleet to around 40
aircraft by 2009.
  
"Size matters but there are plenty of airlines in the world that
went belly up because they grew too fast," said Winkelmann, who is 47
and lived for 10 years in the US where he studied at Harvard
University and served as Lufthansa's chief of the Americas.
  
Germanwings will fly to 56 destinations in Europe in 2007. Its
INTERVIEW: Lufthansa low-cost airline posts profit - plans expansion
German hubs are Cologne/Bonn, Berlin, Stuttgart and Hamburg.
  
The airline shuns using cheaper, out-of-the-way airports favoured
by rivals such as Ryanair in part because they are not accepted by
business travellers who are a key Germanwings customer group.
  
Winkelmann predicts all European flights not taking off or landing
at long-haul hubs will be based on the low-cost model in the coming
years.
  
Germanwings is the low-cost brand in the Lufthansa group. Air
France/KLM are starting a low-cost carrier and British Airways -
"which does a superb job on long-haul flights" - is moving out of the
regional business, he said.
  
Winkelmann cautions that many low-cost airlines lack the capital
for long-term survival.
  
"Most low-cost airlines are losing money," he said, adding:
"Almost all the low-cost smalls will disappear."
  
He declined to say which airlines would likely go bust but praised
four airlines for setting global innovation benchmarks: jetBlue,
Southwest Airlines, Air Canada and his own Lufthansa.
  
"What we promise is on time flights, security and Lufthansa-
trained pilots," said Winkelmann, adding that Germanwings had on-time
peformance of over 84 per cent for the past year.
  
Despite being low-cost, Winkelmann said the most important thing
was to make the Germanwings brand an iron-clad guarantee of good
service in order to expand into new markets.
  
To boost reliability, Germanwings always keeps one A319 aircraft
in reserve in case a scheduled plane needs to be withdrawn from
service, he said.
  
The airline also invests heavily in customer service
representatives who are always reachable for free via email and for a
modest fee on the phone.
  
"Successful low-cost airlines will develop into virtual travel
department stores," said Winkelmann, who has both German and American
citizenship and alternates easily between speaking English and
German.
  
"If you have a trusted brand and products of value the customer
will buy everything from you: hotel rooms, car rentals, insurance,
you name it," he said.
  
Winkelmann said the Germanwings website had 56 million hits alone
in the year 2006. "For a company which did not exist four years ago
that's amazing."
  
Asked what he thought about plans by some airlines to allow mobile
phone use, Winkelmann grimaced.
  
"For me that would be a nightmare. Flying is one of the safe
havens where you can have an hour or two for reading without being
disturbed," said Winkelmann who lists reading along with running and
biking as his main hobbies.
  
INTERVIEW: Lufthansa low-cost airline posts profit - plans expansion
"I really fear it will fuel cases of air rage," he said, adding
that Germanwings will keep its ban on mobile phone use.
  
Looking at new markets, Winkelmann said in addition to expanding
into eastern Europe, Germanwings is closely monitoring the situation
in European countries where state-owned carriers are losing money.
  
Publicly subsidised airlines continue to hinder growth of low-cost
competition, he noted.
  
"State airlines in Italy and Greece have never made money and
won't do so in our lifetimes," he said.
  
A further hindrance to low-cost airlines is the lack of a unified
European air traffic control system.
  
"Hundreds of separate control centres mean a huge waste of jet
fuel and time. This is bad for the environment and bad for our
customers," said Winkelmann.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Transport EU  European Commission investigating Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus Brussels   
The European Commission announced Wednesday a
detailed investigation into the planned hostile takeover by the
low-cost carrier Ryanair of the Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus.
  
It said an initial market investigation indicated that the
proposed 1.48-billion-euro (1.9-billion-dollar) acquisition would
raise serious competition concerns and could reduce choice for
consumers and give rise to higher fares.
  
The EU said a package of remedies proposed by Ryanair in November
to preserve competition was not sufficient. Ryanair submitted a
substantially improved remedy proposal at a late stage but more time
was needed to analyse this.
  
The commission now has 90 working days until May 11, 2007 to take
a final decision.
  
Ryanair is a budget airline operating across 24 European
countries. One of its airport bases is Dublin.
  
Aer Lingus is an Irish carrier, which has recently introduced
features of a low-cost, low-fares airline model, while retaining some
elements of the traditional airline model. Ryanair has already
obtained a significant part of its shares.

Germany 
German airline Lufthansa has sued
the small rural airport at Hahn, west of Frankfurt, alleging it
subsidised operations by budget airline Ryanair, a court spokesman
said Friday.
  
The suit demands that Ireland-based Ryanair restore 2.7 million
euros (3.5 million dollars) in alleged illegal subsidies to the
airport company, which bills the airstrip in hills more than an
hour's drive from the city as one of Frankfurt's airports.
  
Lufthansa contends the airport failed to charge Ryanair that sum
in 2003, the court spokesman in the city of Bad Kreuznach said. Hahn,
formerly a military airstrip, is Ryanair's German hub.
  
The bigger airline is also demanding disclosure of what marketing
aid was provided between 2002 and 2005 by Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn,
the airport company, to Ryanair. It demands that any future subsidies
be cleared by the European Commission in Brussels.
  
The airport said in a statement that it was confident it would
succeed in the case, which it described as really being a legal
assault on Ryanair.
  
A trade body representing German airlines, the BDF, has brought a
complaint on the same grounds before the European Commission. The
airport company said the Commission had already asked it for comment.
  
Lufthansa said it had brought the Hahn case to avoid any expiry at
the end of this year of claims with respect to 2002.

DPAFINANCELatviaBusinessAviationLatvian government defies Competition Council over airport feesRiga 
A Latvian government committee decided on Monday to
keep a system of tax breaks at Riga airport unchanged, despite a
ruling from the Competition Council that the system is unlawful.
  
The airport should reach agreement with airlines unhappy over its
discount system, rather than risking a legal challenge, committee
members said.
  
Riga airport operates a sliding scale of tax discounts for
airlines. The discount is assessed by the number of passengers
carried, with two carriers - low-cost titan Ryanair and Latvian
national airline Air Baltic - receiving an 80 per cent discount.
  
But six other airlines, including British Airways, KLM and
Lufthansa, lodged a complaint with the competition council in 2005,
alleging that the system amounted to an illegal subsidy.
  
On 22 November, the council ruled that the system created
"differing costs for competing airlines on the same routes... which
create unequal competition conditions between airlines," and ordered
the airport to abolish it within 90 days.
  
The decision was harshly criticised by transport minister Ainars
Slesers, the initiator of the discount system. He accused the council
of "threatening the (air transport) sector's further development" and
vowed to have the decision challenged in court.
  
"No council is going to stop my plans for making Riga the biggest
airport in the region," he told the Telegraf daily on Monday.
  
The airport has until 22 December to launch a challenge. Slesers
said the airport "would be told" to do so, the Leta news agency
reported - a move which the government's decision seems to confirm.
Latvian government defies Competition Council over airport fees
  
Air traffic has boomed in Latvia since the country joined the EU
in 2004. Riga Airport has seen passenger numbers treble since then,
and has frequently been described as a potentially major hub for
flights between the EU and CIS.

position" and ordered it to cancel the discount system. The airport
has 90 days to comply.
  
According to the airport's current graded system of discounts,
airlines which handle more than 250,000 passengers per year in Riga
qualify for an 80 per cent discount on their departure fees. The
system was introduced in early 2005.
  
Two airlines - national carrier Air Baltic and low-cost giant
Ryanair - qualified for the maximum discount. However, six other
airlines, including British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and CSA Czech
Airlines, then launched a protest, claiming the system effectively
made them subsidise their rivals.
  
"The discount system doesn't promote honest competition - it's not
fair on those who can't bring in such large numbers," CSA spokesman
Roberts Zabello told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.
  
It is not yet clear what effect the decision will have on the
airport's operations. Riga airport has enjoyed spectacular growth in
recent years, with passenger numbers trebling since 2003.
  
The growth has been largely attributed to the arrival of low-cost
operators Ryanair and EasyJet, and the strong performance of Air
Baltic itself.
  
The Latvian airline recorded a 40-per-cent annual increase in
Latvian Competition Council rejects "unfair" airport fees
passenger numbers in the first 10 months of 2006. In 2005, the
airline's full-year passenger numbers grew almost 50 per cent.
  
Senior figures including the prime minister have called on all
parties to find a solution which would allow the airport to continue
its rapid development.
  
However, the council's ruling could also have political
repercussions. The discount system was introduced by transport
minister Ainars Slesers, leader of a junior party in Latvia's current
four-party ruling coalition.
  
During election campaigns this October, Slesers presented himself
as the man who "brought Ryanair to Riga." The council's decision is
being seen in some quarters as a blow to his prestige.
  
"We have not yet received the full text of the decision. We will
decide what to do once we have analysed it," Slesers' advisor Lauris
Dripe told dpa.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Business Aviation  Aer Lingus employee-shareholders reject Ryanair takeover bid Dublin   
Employees of Irish airline Aer Lingus who own
shares in the company voted overwhelmingly Wednesday against a
hostile takeover bid by fellow Irish carrier Ryanair, dealing a major
blow to Ryanair's chances of acquiring its rival.
  
Members of the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT), comprising
current and former employees with a 12-per-cent share in Aer Lingus,
voted by a majority of 97 per cent to reject Ryanair offer's of 2.80
cents per share.
  
The votes were counted Wednesday, nearly three weeks after ballot
papers were sent to ESOT members on November 3.
  
Nearly 70 per cent of ESOT members, or 3224 people, took part in
the ballot.
  
The two major trade unions in Aer Lingus, IMPACT and SIPTU,
welcomed the outcome of the ballot, saying they believed an
independent Aer Lingus better served the interests of the company and
customers.
  
In late September, the Irish government floated Aer Lingus on the
Dublin and London stock markets at a price of 2.20 euros per share,
which valued the airline then at 1.13 billion euros.
  
In a surprise move, Ryanair on October 5 launched a takeover bid
for the company of 1.48 billion euros, or 2.80 cents per share, an
offer judged conservative by analysts.
  
By now, Ryanair has built up a stake of at least 19.2 per cent,
but the anti-Ryanair camp now own 46.6 per cent of Aer Lingus stock,
making it virtually impossible for Ryanair chief executive Michael
O'Leary to get a majority stake of more than 50 per cent.

DPA FINANCE Latvia Business Aviation  Latvian competition council to decide on "unfair" airport taxes Riga   
The Latvian Competition Council, an independent
watchdog, is set to decide on Wednesday on allegations of unfair
charging structures at Riga International Airport.
  
"Six airlines have protested that two companies receive
disproportionately low discounts (at the airport). The Competition
Council is examining the case for possible unfair practices,"
spokesman Maris Gorbunovs told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.
  
Riga airport - the fastest-growing airport in the Baltic region -
offers airlines a sliding scale of discounts based on the number of
passengers they bring in per year.
  
Currently, two airlines - low-cost giant Ryanair and Latvian
national carrier Air Baltic - bring in more than 250,000 passengers
per year, and thus qualify for an 80 per cent discount.
  
But six other airlines, including British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa
and CSA Czech Airlines, have challenged the policy. They claim that
the 80 per cent discount means that the two largest airlines are
effectively being subsidised by smaller rivals.
  
"The discount system doesn't promote honest competition - it's not
fair on those who can't bring in such large numbers," CSA spokesman
Roberts Zabello told dpa.
  
Officials at the Latvian Transport Ministry - which initiated the
policy - claim that the system is entirely fair.
  
"The discount system is based on passenger numbers, not the names
of airlines. (The six airlines) have as many planes as Ryanair - if
they flew as many people here as Ryanair do, they'd get the same
treatment," said Arnis Muiznieks, head of aviation at the ministry.
Latvian competition council to decide on "unfair" airport taxes
  
The stakes are high. Riga airport has enjoyed explosive growth
since Latvia joined the EU in 2004, with the number of incoming
passengers more than trebling in three years.
  
And the airport - tipped as a future base of operations for
Ryanair - has ambitious expansion plans including the construction of
new hotels, offices and a major conference centre.
  
The case also threatens to have a major political impact. The
discount system was initiated by Transport Minister Ainars Slesers, a
self-made millionaire who has since presented himself as the man who
brought Ryanair to Riga.
  
Slesers has been widely reported as saying that he will ask for
the Competition Council to be fired if they decide that the discount
system is unfair - a comment which itself has aroused widespread
criticism.
  
"It's madness for the transport minister to try and get involved
in the work of an independent institution. Of course, it creates a
very negative effect," economist Alf Vanags told the Diena newspaper.
  
The Competition Council should reach its decision on Wednesday and
publish it "soon thereafter," Gorbunovs said.

DPA x Italy Terrorism  ROUNDUP: Rome airport reopens after false bomb alert Rome   
Rome's Ciampino airport reopened to air traffic on
Tuesday after it was shut down briefly because of a bomb alert that
turned out to be false, Sky Italia television reported.
  
The airport remained closed for just over 90 minutes while bomb
disposal officers inspected cargo planes parked on its runways.
  
Incoming flights were diverted to the city's main Fiumicino
airport while departing flights were delayed, prompting long queues
at its check-ins.
  
The alert had been prompted by an anonymous caller, who phoned
fire fighters shortly after 8 am to say there was a bomb aboard a
cargo plane.
  
Ciampino airport, which is located about 30 kilometres south of
the Italian capital, hosts military and private planes and low-cost
carriers such as Easyjet and Ryanair.

Frankfurt   
Both prosecutors and air investigators said
Tuesday they were checking out allegations that a German Air Force
fighter jet flew dangerously close to a Ryanair passenger plane over
Germany.
  
A woman passenger on the airliner, which was carrying about 170
passengers on October 16, told prosecutors the Tornado fighter dived
past at a distance of just 100 metres, while the air force says the
planes were 750 metres apart.
  
Prosecutors in Bad Kreuznach said they had begun a formal inquiry
into causing personal injury, but had not named a suspect yet.
  
The Irish budget-airline plane was on its landing approach to Hahn
airport, west of Frankfurt, on a flight from Pisa, Italy. Its pilot
reported the suspected near miss after landing.
  
Air traffic control in the Frankfurt region said the distance
between the jets, as indicated by radar, was 350 metres. German
federal accident investigators are already studying the case and
expect to issue a report in early December.
  
Witnesses said two Tornado planes had flown above the Ryanair
plane, with one suddenly diving "quite close" to the passenger jet.

Irish budget airline Ryanair Monday reported a rise

months to the end of September.
  
The half-year record profits came despite higher costs following a
terror alert at British airports in August over US-bound flights.
  
Despite the growth, Ryanair would push ahead with plans to sue the
British government over losses incurred during the alert, Ryanair
chief executive Michael O'Leary said Monday.
  
He also confirmed that Ryanair would proceed with controversial
plans to take over rival Irish airline Aer Lingus.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Business Aviation  Aer Lingus again rejects "ill-conceived" Ryanair bid Dublin   
Irish national carrier Aer Lingus said Friday it is
still rejecting low-fare airline Ryanair's takeover bid offer of 2.80
euros per shares.
  
The Dublin-based airline said the offer - first made when Ryanair
announced its 1.48 billion euro (1.9 billion dollar) takeover aims on
October 5 - was clearly below value, as well as being poorly
conceived, contradictory and uncompetitive.
  
The Aer Lingus statement came as meanwhile Ryanair reported a
strong year-on-year rise in passenger numbers for October.
  
It said it carried 3.731 million passengers in the month, compared
with 3.025 million in October 2005.
  
In late September, the Irish government floated Aer Lingus on the
Dublin and London stock markets at a price of 2.20 euros per share,
which valued the airline then at 1.13 billion euros.
  
Ryanair immediately acquired a 16.1 per cent stake and said it was
seeking to boost its holding further.
  
But the Irish government retained a blocking 25 per cent minority
stake in Aer Lingus and has made clear since then that it would keep
its holding in order to maintain competition in Ireland's aviation
market.
  
Irish unions are also opposed to the takeover, fearing the loss of
jobs at Aer Lingus, while a company representing Aer Lingus pilots
has also increased its stake in the airline in order to help thwart
Ryanair.
  
Aer Lingus and Ryanair combined account for over 70 per cent of

Tiger Airlines is seeking to fly to five
destinations in India and one in Sri Lanka after receiving approval
from Singapore authorities, the budget carrier said Thursday.
  
Among the cities are exotic Goa on India's west coast, the
commercial centre Kozhikode in the state of Kerala, Kolkata
(Calcutta), Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Colombo in Sri Lanka.
  
"We have filed the necessary applications with the authorities in
India and Sri Lanka and hope to progressively add the six new points
to our network from next year," The Straits Times quoted chief
executive Tony Davis as saying.
  
By the end of 2007, Tiger expects to have a fleet of 12 Airbus
single-aisle planes and to fly to 21 points out of Singapore.
  
The carrier is a partnership between Singapore Airlines, state
investment arm Temasek Holdings, the founders of Irish low-cost
airline Ryanair and US-based marketing consultants Indigo Partners.
  
Tiger's foray into India comes as competitor Jetstar Asia is
scaling back flights to Bangalore after dropping Kolkata six months
ago and adding flights to Indonesia.
  
"We have had flights to Kolkata for some time, but we wanted to go
into India in a meaningful way with multiple destinations instead of
launching an isolated point," Davis told the newspaper.

DPA x Germany Transport Accidents  Ryanair pilot says fighter jet came dangerously close Frankfurt   
Germany's DFS air traffic control agency said
Friday it was looking into a complaint that a fighter jet came
dangerously close to a plane flown by the budget airline Ryanair
over Germany.
  
An initial inquiry showed that the Tornado jet came "quite close"
to the Ryanair plane as it was approaching Hahn airport west of
Frankfurt on Monday, then flew away and landed at the German Air
Force's Noervenich Air Base.
  
DFS spokesman Axel Raab said it was still not clear how close the
two planes had come, but the pilot of the Ryanair flight from Pisa,
Italy, obviously regarded it as "dangerous" since he filed a report
after landing.
  
The inquiry showed two Tornado planes had flown above the Ryanair
plane, with one suddenly diving "quite close" to the passenger plane.
He did not confirm that the fighter jets were Germany, but the German
Air Force said it had begun an inquiry of its own.
  
German newspapers said 170 people were aboard the Ryanair plane at
the time.

DPA FINANCE Ireland Business Aviation  ROUNDUP: Ryanair launches takeover bid for Irish carrier Aer Lingus 
Dublin   
The Irish government said Thursday it would not
sell its 25-per-cent share in national carrier Aer Lingus after low-
cost airline Ryanair launched a 1.48-billion-euro (1.88-billion-
dollar) takeover bid for the company.
  
"The government remains fully committed to competition in the
aviation market and will not be selling its shares in Aer Lingus,"
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern told a parliament shocked by the news.
  
Ahern described the Ryanair bid as "unexpected," while Transport
Minister Martin Cullen said Ryanair's move was not welcome and that
he would await a decision on the matter by the Irish Competition
Authority.
  
Both SIPTU and Impact, the two largest trade unions at Aer Lingus
said they were opposed to the proposed takeover.
  
"The union believes that an independent stand-alone Aer Lingus is
in the best interests of the company, the country, passengers and
staff," IMPACT said, citing "clearly significant competition issues"
in the bid that would create a quasi monopoly on passenger air travel
in and out of Ireland.
  
Aer Lingus and Ryanair account for over 70 per cent of Ireland's
short-haul market.
  
Announcing the bid, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said
the move represented a "unique opportunity to form one strong airline
group for Ireland and for European consumers," with combined
passengers of over 50 million.
  
Ryanair had already acquired a 16-per-cent stake in Aer Lingus
ROUNDUP: Ryanair launches takeover bid for Irish carrier Aer Lingus
since its flotation last week on the Dublin and London stock markets,
he said.
  
Ryanair's cash offer of 2.80 euros per share for the rest of the
airline's shares values the company at 1.48 billion euros.
  
That offer is conditional on it acquiring at least a majority of
50.1 per cent of shares in Aer Lingus, O' Leary said.
  
The Ryanair chief said both companies would continue to operate
separately, would "compete vigorously" on the few routes both
companies serve and that the Aer Lingus brand would remain in place.
  
He also pledged to "expand, enhance and upgrade the Aer Lingus
operations" and to leave in situ any union arrangements in place at
Aer Lingus.
  
Ryanair itself refuses to negotiate with unions and conducts
direct negotiations with staff.
  
Several opposition parties on Thursday blasted the government for
leaving Aer Lingus open to a hostile takeover by privatizing it.
  
In Dublin, Aer Lingus shares soared 13.9 per cent by Thursday noon
to 2.88 euros while Ryanair shares, after an initial dip, rallied to
8.85 euros, up 1.7 per cent.

Dublin    
Low-cost Irish airline Ryanair on Thursday
announced a 1.48-billion-euro (1.88-billion-dollar) takeover bid for
Irish national carrier Aer Lingus, which was listed on the Dublin and
London stock markets last week.
  
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the move represented
a "unique opportunity to form one strong airline group for Ireland
and for European consumers," with combined passengers of over 50
million.
  
Ryanair said it had already acquired a 16-per-cent stake in Aer
Lingus since its flotation.
  
Ryanair's cash offer of 2.80 euros per share for the rest of the
airline's shares values the company at 1.48 billion.
  
O'Leary said both companies would continue to operate separately
and "compete vigorously" on the few routes both companies serve.
  
He also pledged to "expand, enhance and upgrade the Aer Lingus
operations."
  
Ryanair has also pledged to retain the Aer Lingus brand and all
the profitable routes currently operated by the airline.
  
The Irish government still owns around 30 per cent of Aer Lingus.

Britain's Jet2 and Denmark's Sterling are the
newest budget carriers to begin flights to Poland where the air
travel market is soaring, Poland's Rzeczpospolita daily reported
Wednesday.
  
In October, Jet2 will begin two flights a week to and from Leeds
and Newcastle to Krakow, while Denmark's Sterling will link
Copenhagen with the historic and scenic Polish city, which has become
a hit with foreign tourists.
  
Budget airlines are flocking to the Polish market which is
projected to grow to 63.8 million passengers by 2030 from the 14.3
million total estimated for 2006, according to the report.
  
Budget carriers operating flights to Poland include Centralwings,
Blue1, Easyjet, Germanwings, Jet2, Norwegian, Ryanair, Sterling and
Wizzair.
  
The carriers fly into 11 Polish airports scattered across the
country of nearly 40 million citizens. Most have chosen the capital
Warsaw and the southern city of Krakow as their ports of call.
  
Traffic has picked up significantly since Poland's entry into the
European Union in 2004, with tens of thousands of Poles using cheap
flights to fly in search of work in the UK or Ireland.
  
Tourist traffic to Poland is also growing with a 6.4 per cent rise
to 15.2 million foreign visitors to Poland from 2004 to 2005,
according to Economy Ministry figures.

DPA x dpa SPECIAL Travel  Mobile phone conversations take to the air  
Dublin (dpa) ­ Passengers on Ryanair will soon be able to call
their friends from the air using their own phone.
  
Next year, the Dublin-based airline plans to install 50 machines
that receive and transmit signals on planes. Starting in 2008, the
company's entire fleet of Boeing 737s should be fitted with the
devices. Costs for the phone calls will be set by international
roaming standards and charged to mobile phone bills.
  
Air France announced in April that it will start using new Airbus
A318s in 2007 that allow passengers to use their own mobile phones
without disturbing the plane's navigation instruments. Between March
and September 2008, passengers will get to try out the service on
some European and North African routes. Just like Ryanair, passengers
will not be limited to using their mobile phones for making calls,
scanning the web and sending text messages. They will also be able to
use laptops or smart phones.
  
The final decision on whether Ryanair passengers will be able to
use their mobile phones in the clouds is still up to certain
government agencies. "A rewrite of Germany's Aircraft Electronics
Operations Authorization is being considered," said Cornelia Cramer,
spokeswoman for the German Federal Air Traffic Agency. For now, using
mobile phones on board German airplanes remains forbidden.
  
The Swiss company OnAir is the technical partner for the mobile
service with both Ryanair and Air France. If implemented, the mobile
conversations will be routed through satellites and ground
transmitters.

DPA FINANCE Slovakia Business Aviation Austria  Regulators reject Vienna-Bratislava airport merger 
Bratislava   
Slovakia's anti-monopoly watchdog rejected
Tuesday a proposed takeover of the country's largest airports by a
group led by the Vienna airport authority.
  
The decision by the Slovak Anti-monopoly Office (PMU) was expected
but was quickly criticized by officials with the TwoOne consortium,
which had offered about 20 billion koruna (676 million dollars) for
the state-owned airports in Bratislava and Kosice.
  
The decision will be appealed and claims of foreign-investor
cheating may be filed in international courts against the Slovak
government, said Jozef Oravkin of TwoOne's Slovak partner, Penta
Investments.
  
Oravkin also raised "a cause of concern" over whether PMU
maintained political independence why studying the merger plan.
  
TwoOne - which includes Vienna airport operator Flughafen Wien,
Austria's Raiffeisen bank, and Penta - won a government tender for
the Slovak airports in February, outbidding a competing offer from a
group led by Spain's Albertis Infrastructures.
  
However, the sale and all other privatization projects were frozen
a few weeks later pending a June election.
  
The election led to a change in government, and new Prime Minister
Robert Fico declared an end to all privatizations including the
airports deal.
  
Fico formally halted the sale in August while PMU, an independent
regulator, continued analyzing the TwoOne proposal based on its
impact on the airline market.
Regulators reject Vienna - Bratislava airport merger
  
Tuesday's ruling by PMU declared that the deal would eliminate the
"effective competition" between the Bratislava and Vienna airports,
which are about 50 kilometres apart.
  
"In this case, the horizontal concentration of two airports in
immediate proximity would develop into a reduction for the market
structure, leading to the creation of a regional monopoly," the PMU
ruling said.
  
PMU based its decision on an analysis of regional flights and
passenger loads at each airport.
  
Vienna's airport is served by nearly 60 airlines, while
Bratislava's field handles about 20 airlines.
  
Among the biggest airlines in Bratislava are the Slovak low-cost
carrier SkyEurope and the Irish budget airline Ryanair, which had
opposed the TwoOne deal. A competing budget carrier, Germanwings,
serves Vienna.
  
TwoOne claimed that a Vienna-Bratislava merger would make sense
for airlines and consumers. The group had promised to invest heavily
in both Slovak airports and build a rail link between the Bratislava
and Vienna facilities.

The Maltese government Monday gave two major low-
cost airlines, Ryanair and Easy Jet, the go-ahead to operate new
routes to the Mediterranean island.
  
Accepting incentives worth some 2.3 million euros (3 million
dollars) a year to operate year-round services, Ryanair will within
eight weeks be offering a daily service to Malta from London's Luton
airport and a thrice-weekly flight from Pisa, Italy.
  
Ryanair, which expects to bring about 87,000 tourists to Malta
every year, will also operate a thrice-weekly flight from Dublin as
from next February.
  
Easy Jet will start daily flights from Luton and five-weekly
flights from Switzerland.
  
The move follows pressure from the island's hoteliers and tour
operators as well as calls on Tourism Minister Francis Zammit Dimech
to resign in the wake of a 10-year-low decline in tourism figures.
  
The Maltese government had been reluctant to introduce low-cost
airlines because of fears they would badly affect the national
carrier, Air Malta, as well as major airlines operating to the island
such as Lufthansa, Alitalia and British Airways.
  
Around 1.1 million tourists visit Malta every year.

DPA FINANCE Britain Terrorism Aviation  Ryanair to sue British government over increased airport security 
London   
Irish low-fare airline Ryanair said Friday it will
sue the British government for 3.3 million pounds (4.9 million euros)
because of delays and cancellations resulting from increased airport
security.
  
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said the claim
represents losses from cancellations and lost bookings over the week
of August 10-16.
  
"The purpose of this claim is to encourage the Department for
Transport to restore UK airport security to the effective
International Air Transport Association (IATA) norm, and to prevent
similar breakdowns at UK airports during future security scares by
putting in the necessary police and army personnel to carry out the
extra security checks whenever the Government decides to double or
quadruple them again, without notice," he said.
  
O'Leary said the no-frills carrier's "sole motive in this action
is to defeat terrorism by returning airport security to normal" and
that any compensation awarded would be given to Orbis, a charity
working to eliminate avoidable blindness in the developing world.
  
He described the additional security measures at British airports
as "nonsensical and ineffective" and added they are "handing the
extremists an undeserved and unnecessary victory."
  
On August 10, the British authorities announced they had foiled a
terrorist plot aimed at blowing up planes bound from Britain to the
US over the Atlantic. Since then heightened security measures have
been in place at British airports.
  
Eleven suspects appeared before a London court Tuesday on charges
Ryanair to sue British government over increased airport security
of involvement in the alleged plot.

DPA POLITICS Britain Terrorism Aviation  ROUNDUP: Ryanair gives ultimatum to London over security steps 
London   
Irish low-fare airline Ryanair issued an ultimatum
to the British government Friday giving London seven days to restore
airport security measures to normal levels or else face claims for
compensation.
  
The demand was sent to Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander, with
Ryanair saying that if it were met then it would "not make any claim
for compensation which it is entitled to under the provision of
section 93 of the Transport Act 2000."
  
The airline had complained of massive losses resulting from costly
flight cancellations and delays, particularly at the main hub of its
operations, Stansted Airport, as a result of the extensive new
security checks imposed in the wake of a terror air bombing plot.
  
"The best way to defeat terrorists and extremists is for ordinary
people to continue to live their lives as normal," said Ryanair chief
executive Michael O'Leary.
  
"Because of the additional security restrictions imposed by the
government last thursday, the shambles a tthe London airports has
been anything but normal," he added.
  
O'Leary cited how London had "successfull led the return to
normality" of London's Underground after the July 7, 2005 terrorist
attacks.
  
"It is important that they now restore security at the London
airports to normality and remove some of these nonsensical, and (from
a security perspective) totally ineffective restrictions which were
introduced last week," he said, warning that otherwise, the
government would "have handed the extremists an enormous PR victory."
ROUNDUP: Ryanair gives ultimatum to London over security steps
  
In specific terms, Ryanair was requesting a return to previous
regulations on the size of hand luggage and reducing the number of
passenger body searches back to the previous one-in-four, instead of
the current one-in-two.
  
The airline said that it wanted Alexander's assurances that if in
future the government ordered a quadrupling of body searches, then
police and army reserves would be put on duty to help out.
  
"This will at least allow the increased security to be carried
out, in an emergency, without the disruptions, delays and
cancellations that have characterised the chaos at London airports
over the past week," the airline said.
  
Signs of support came earlier Friday when officials at Virgin
Atlantic Airways said that the airline was talking with BAA about
possible compensation.

DPA POLITICS Britain Terrorism Aviation  Ryanair mulls legal action against London over security steps 
London   
Budget airline Ryanair was preparing Friday to
unveil plans for a possible lawsuit against the British government to
recoup losses from the new anti-terrorist security steps at airports.
  
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, angered by his airline
having had to cancel dozens of flights during the security crisis
last week, has targeted the new baggage rules which he called
"nonsensical."
  
Reports in London said it was believed Ryanair was seeking to
enlist the backing of other airlines in getting compensation.
  
A few days earlier, Ryanair had in particular targeted airport
operator BAA for inadequate staffing, especially at Stansted airport,
to handle the extra security precautions, while even suggesting that
the British army or police be called in to help.
  
On its website, Ryanair carried a statement saying "we continue to
call on the UK Government to lead the process of returning normality
to London's airports by addressing the root causes of the problems.
  
"If the Government insists on doubling the number of security
checks, then they must send in extra army or police personnel to help
the BAA to carry out these checks," the statement said.
  
Signs of support came Friday when officials at Virgin Atlantic
Airways said that the airline was talking with BAA about possible
compensation.

London   
Airlines using British airports are considering
suing the government for up to 300 million pounds (570 million
dollars) to recover losses incurred since extra security measures
were imposed last week, the Times reported Thursday.
  
The British daily said the airlines were hoping the threat of
legal action would force a lifting of restrictions on hand luggage
that had caused serious delays.
  
Airlines have cancelled hundreds of flights and been forced to
provide hotel accommodation for thousands of passengers as a result
of the delays caused by a terrorism scare that began a week ago.
  
According to the Times, budget airline Ryanair is behind the legal
action.
  
It has sent an e-mail to other airlines saying it intended to use
British legislation "to put pressure on the government to remove some
of the illogical and unworkable restrictions at airports that are
leading to large-scale disruptions and flight cancellations."
  
A British Airways spokesman told the Times company lawyers were
looking into the matter.
  
Easyjet said it was looking into whether there was a case against
BAA, the company that operates Britain's main airports, or against
the government.
  
The British Air Transport Association (BATA), which represents 13
British airlines, has called on the Transport Ministry to restore the
hand luggage regulations in force before the terrorist scare.

DPA FINANCE Germany Business Aviation  ROUNDUP: Air Berlin buys DBA as airline sector faces shakeout 
Berlin   
Shares in budget airline Air Berlin Plc surged 6.9
per cent Thursday after Germany's second biggest carrier announced
that it had acquired rival DBA as consolidation pressures grow in the
country's intensely competitive aviation business.
  
While the details of the purchase price were not revealed, Air
Berlin said that it would pay a "mid double-digit million euro"
amount for the Munich-based DBA as part of moves to expand the number
of its routes and boost passenger numbers.
  
"Acquiring our dream partner was an opportunity not to be missed,"
Air Berlin chief executive Joachim Hunold said announcing the
surprise purchase, which followed weeks of secret talks.
  
The announcement led to Air Berlin shares jumping to 10.58 euros
(13.60 dollars) in early morning trading and consequently helped to
push the group's stock back up to its back up towards its May issue
price of 12 euros.
  
Air Berlin's announcement that it was buying its Munich rival is
also a sign of the growing pressures for a shakeout in Germany's air
travel sector with increasing competition in the aviation industry
following a dramatic jump in the number of budget airlines setting up
in the nation.
  
Germans are also the world's travel champions, resulting in major
discount air carriers such as Ryanair Holdings Plc and Easyjet Plc
boosting their operations in Europe's biggest economy and as a result
challenging major scheduled airlines.
  
For Air Berlin, which currently operates 58 aircraft flying in
particular to holiday destinations, the DBA purchase will mean the
ROUNDUP: Air Berlin buys DBA as airline sector faces shakeout
two combined airlines will carry about 20 million passengers this
year.
  
Moreover, with DBA having a strong focus on Germany's domestic
business travel market, Berlin-based Air Berlin will be able to add
lucrative corporate customers to its passenger lists.
  
"The route networks of Air Berlin and DBA complement each other
superbly because there are no overlaps," Hunold said.
  
"We can integrate DBA's domestic routes in our European network
without any problem, thereby achieving a clear increase in the number
of business travellers using our airline."
  
Air Berlin said it is also expecting the deal to lead to a
"significant profit" this year with the expansion of the group's
business leading to it intensifying its rivalry with Lufthansa AG,
Germany's number one carrier.
  
The DBA takeover coincides with Air Berlin saying that it had
swung into a profit during the second quarter this year.
  
Air Berlin said it had turned last year's second-quarter loss of
4.2 million euros into a net gain of 30.1 million euros in the second
quarter this year, boosted by a 22-per-cent jump in revenue to 401
million euros.
  
Formerly known as Deutsche BA, DBA was acquired by a management
team from British Airways Plc about three years ago. Air Berlin said
it would be managed as a separate operation.
  
However, the Air Berlin takeover of DBA still has to be approved
by Germany's monopoly authorities.

DPA FINANCE Europe Terrorism Business  NEWS FEATURE: Business counts the costs of airline terror plot  
Andrew McCathie, dpa Berlin   
As British airports struggled to return to normal
after last week's dramatic terror alert, the travel and airline
industries have begun counting the cost of the delays and
cancellations that followed the allegations of a plot to blow up
trans-Atlantic jetliners.
  
Almost 2,500 flights have been cancelled at London's three
principal airports since last Thursday when revelations about the
scheme plunged air travel in Britain into chaos and triggered a
security clampdown across the global aviation sector.
  
The sense of upheaval which followed last Thursday's news that
British police were holding more than 20 suspects in connection with
the plot is estimated to have cost major British carriers alone about
475 million dollars.
  
While industry draws up battle plans for business travellers to
cope with a new era of strict airport security, the prospects of
airlines facing an additional cost burden has raised questions about
the future of Europe's budget airlines, which have emerged as major
competitors to scheduled carriers.
  
Airline shares might have pulled back from the lows they hit last
week following concerns about the impact on the air travel business
of new security regulations in the wake of news of the alleged plan
to attack aircraft flying between Britain and the US.
  
But the new terror alarm and the moves to dramatically beef up
airport and airline security comes at a time when the aviation
business has been battling intense competition, soaring fuel prices
and a recent round of scares from terrorism through to bird flu.
NEWS FEATURE: Business counts the costs of airline terror plot
  
In particular, this is the case as the claims that terrorists were
planning to take out up to ten aircraft on the trans-Atlantic route
emerged in the middle of the European summer holiday season.
  
The lead many airline travellers to swap to rival means of
transport, such as the Eurostar between London and continental
Europe.
  
In a radio interview, Michael O'Leary, the chief of Europe's
leading budget airline, Ryanair Holdings PLC, described the fall-out
from the terror scare as "almost the breakdown of the London
airports."
  
Meanwhile, the airlines have been forced to foot the hotel bill
for passengers left stranded by the security scare as well as to
refund tickets and even pay compensation to travellers for cancelled
flights.
  
Furthermore, both the airport authorities and the airlines are
likely to face an increased expense of training staff to deal with
the new security measures.
  
In the long term, analysts also say the risk for the airline
business is that travellers will be put off flying by the tough
security measures and the threat of long queues and more specially
avoid the various airlines that appear to have become likely
terrorist targets.
  
In the meantime, regular business travellers have been trying to
weigh up the cost of the round of new security measures that are
likely to place new restrictions on cabin bags and involve longer
waits at check-in and for the immediate future, possibly even
retrieving baggage.
  
British Airways plc alone is currently attempting to clear a
backlog in Britain of about 20,000 checked-in pieces of luggage.
  
As gridlock descended on British airports the airline was forced
to hire trucks to cargo baggage around Europe.
  
British Airways said it is now considering legal action against
British airport operator BAA plc for lost earnings, estimated at
about 95 million dollars.
  
In addition, for companies jetting their executives around the
world, the extensive airport security checks and risks of enormous
delays means that the period of time and consequently costs for
business trips may have to be increased.
  
The rigorous security measures might have been eased in recent
days to allow passengers using British airports to carry on to their
flight hand luggage the size of a portable computer.
  
But apart from the added stress of trying to fly between world's
biggest financial market and Europe's largest financial centre - New
York and London - possible new carry-on luggage restrictions have
raised questions about how laptops and mobile phones, which now form
a key part of business travel, can be transported in future scares.
  
Already several leading companies have issued guidelines to their
business travellers advising them to leave their computers at home
NEWS FEATURE: Business counts the costs of airline terror plot
rather than risk them between damaged or lost in the aircraft's hold
in event of tough security measures being reintroduced.
  
The added problem for business is that many of the trips that
their executives have to mount are arranged at the last moment and
are aimed at finally securing a deal in face-to-face negotiations.
  
The new security measures have led to doubts about the prospects
for Europe's budget airlines, which have in recent years helped to
drive down the cost of air tickets.
  
Analysts say the network of no-frills carriers, which have emerged
in recent years, could be forced to face the difficult choice in the
coming years of passing any additional costs for security on to the
flying public through higher fares or drastically cut their earnings.
  
What is more, they say the latest terror crisis has exposed the
vulnerability of budget airlines, because a key part of their
business is tight turnaround times between when a flight lands and
when it takes off again.

DPA x Britain Terrorism Aviation  Chaos continues at British airports amid calls for army to step in 
London   
Chaotic scenes were still in evidence at many
British airports Sunday four days after the country triggered its
highest terrorist alert level.
  
At Europe's largest airport, London Heathrow, a third of all
flights were cancelled because of massive queues at check-in desks.
  
A spokeswoman for Heathrow said Sunday that some 500 passengers
had spent the night at the airport.
  
Meanwhile, opposition politicians called for troops to be sent to
the airports.
  
The troops could help with security checks and the search for
explosives, Conservative Party security spokesman David Davis said.
  
The British Transport Ministry said it regretted the inconvenience
caused to tens of thousands of travellers, but said it did not see
any practical benefit in using the army.
  
British Airways chief executive Willie Walsh accused the airport
operator British Airports Authority (BAA) of incompetence.
  
BAA was unable to cope with the government's increased
requirements for passenger and luggage checks and new hand-luggage
rules that ban people from taking liquids with them, Walsh said.
  
Budget airline Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary
criticized the extensive body searches at London's Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted airports which were creating such long delays that
normal airline business was no longer possible.
  
"Ryanair and other major UK airlines cannot keep cancelling
flights and disrupting the travel plans of tens of thousands of
Chaos continues at British airports amid calls for army to step in
British passengers and visitors solely because the BAA cannot cope
with the new body search requirements," O'Leary said.

The British government and major airlines said
Friday they hoped air traffic would return to normal a day after the
major disruptions caused by the foiled terrorist plot.
  
While knock-on effects, and the continued ban on hand luggage
being taken on board, remained, British Airways (BA) said it hoped to
get "the majority of flights away" Friday.
  
BA, which cancelled more than 400 flights Thursday, said it was
hoping to operate 70 per cent of its short-haul services out of
Heathrow, with around 120 flights likely to be cancelled.
  
Among them were six US flights, three of them to New York and the
others to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington.
  
Budget airlines, which carry thousands of people off on summer
holidays, remained among the worst hit.
  
EasyJet, which axed around 300 flights Thursday, on Friday
cancelled 112 flights, saying it needed to catch up on the
disruptions.
  
Rival Ryanair scrapped more than 30 flights to and from Stansted
Airport in Essex.
  
EasyJet said it decided to cancel flights to destinations that
passengers could, at least, get to by train.
  
Consequently, the airline scrapped its services from Luton,
Stansted and Gatwick to destinations in Scotland, as well as to
Paris, Amsterdam and Geneva.

"It's been much better today. Airports have had 24 hours to get
used to the new systems and passengers have been very good about
arriving without hand luggage," he added.

Huge queues spilled out of the check-in terminals
at London's main Heathrow airport Thursday as thousands of air
passengers endured a day of mounting chaos, delays and cancellations
following the terror alert over US-bound flights.
  
Heathrow, Europe's busiest international airport, which handles
200,000 passengers a day, was worst affected, but the knock-on effect
of the terrorist scare was also felt at other hubs in London and
major British cities.
  
British Airways cancelled more than 360 flights, of a total of 650
planned Heathrow departures, as short-haul flights into Heathrow were
suspended for most of the day.
  
Delays are expected to continue Friday, with passengers compelled
to check in all hand luggage and undergo individual hand searches.
  
Budget airlines Easyjet and Ryanair, who were due to fly thousands
of people off on summer holidays, also axed hundreds of flights.
  
Easyjet scrapped all flights in and out of Gatwick, Luton and
Stansted airports and cancelled around 300 flights in total.
  
Flights were disrupted at all other British airports, although
they stayed open for business.
  
Natalie Johnson, 36, who found her Prague-bound Easyjet flight for
a hen party cancelled, said, "I am just upset because we were booked
into a really nice hotel and had a good itinerary and now we can't do
any of that."

DPA FINANCE Latvia Transport Aviation  NEWS FEATURE: East-West strategy pays off for Latvian airline  Ben 
Nimmo, dpa Riga   
Latvian national airline AirBaltic unveiled strong
growth figures for the first half of 2006 on Thursday, strengthening
its position as a growing player in East-West air transit.
  
AirBaltic recorded a 44-per cent increase in passenger numbers, a
7-per cent rise in cabin occupancy and a 74-per cent gain in
operating income compared with the first half of 2005. The airline
closed the half with a profit of 984,000 lats (1.8 million dollars).
  
"Despite growing competition and rising costs, we have managed to
both maintain growth and improve our results in all aspects of
business," said the airline's president, Bertolt Flick.
  
The figures are seen in Latvia as a vindication of the airline's
strategy. AirBaltic's aim is to position itself as a key player in
transit between northern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
  
Since Latvia joined the EU and its "Open Skies" area in May 2004,
the airline has opened a second hub in the Lithuanian capital,
Vilnius, doubled the size of its fleet, and seen passenger numbers
rise from half a million to an expected 1.5 million this year.
  
It has also expanded its traditionally western-oriented network
with flights to a series of CIS destinations such as Baku, Tbilisi,
Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk and Kaliningrad.
  
"The demand for such 'exotic' destinations as Tbilisi, Baku and
Bergen is stronger now than demand for destinations like Vienna and
Moscow was in 2003. This shows how much the industry has changed in
Latvia," Flick commented.
  
NEWS FEATURE: East-West strategy pays off for Latvian airline
The figures come at a time when competition in Latvian aviation is
increasing dramatically. A string of low-cost airlines, including
Easyjet and Norwegian, have opened flights to Riga, and Ryanair is
rumoured to be planning to open a hub there.
  
AirBaltic, which introduced one-way ticketing in 2003, has been
forced to slash prices on key routes. Tickets for under 10 dollars
one way are already available on flights to Bergen, Hamburg, Helsinki
and Oslo, and the plan is to expand this low-cost model.
  
"Step by step, we are coming closer to a time when similar (low-
cost) ticket starting prices will be introduced on all airBaltic
flights," Flick commented.
  
The airline's decision to strengthen its eastern presence is a
further reaction to increased competition within the EU. Riga is one
of the union's easternmost airports, and Latvia, as a former Soviet
republic, is a known brand in the CIS.
  
"We will certainly see more flights to more eastern cities more
often. In Soviet times two million passengers a year left Latvia for
the East: we may not return to that level, but there will be more
than we have now," Flick said.
  
AirBaltic expects to carry around 1.5 million passengers in 2006
and to open at least four more flights by the end of the year.
Despite the rapid growth, however, Flick is careful to point out its
limitations.
  
"Our strength is flights between regional centres. We have some
longer flights within Europe, and there will be more, but we have no
plans for long-haul, intercontinental flights," he told Deutsche
Presse-Agentur dpa.

Washington/Berlin   
The United States upgraded its terrorist
threat level Thursday and international airlines cancelled hundreds
of flights to England after authorities there said they had thwarted
a major terrorist plot to blow up aircraft over the Atlantic.
  
The US raised to "orange" the threat level for all flights and to
"red" - the highest possible level - for flights arriving from
Britain, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said in a
statement Thursday.
  
  
   Earlier, British authorities said they had foiled a "very
significant" terrorist plot aimed at bringing down a "number of
aircraft through mid-air explosions" using explosives placed in hand
luggage on flights to the US, Home Secretary John Reid said Thursday.
  
Chertoff said that while the US believed British authorities had
"significantly disrupted" the planned attack, the US could not be
certain that the threat "has been entirely eliminated or the plot
completely thwarted."
  
Scenes at Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London were described
as "chaotic" as the terrorist threat in Britain was raised to
"critical"  - its highest level - for the first time ever and all
incoming flights to Heathrow Airport were blocked, affecting
thousands of people.
  
Heathrow Airport was not expected to reopen to traffic until
around 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) because of the backlog, airport authorities
said.
  
British Airways had suspended all short-haul flights from

carrying around 3,000 passengers had had to turn back to Frankfurt,
Hamburg and Dusseldorf.
  
In the Netherlands, passengers departing from Schiphol airport to

National carrier KLM cancelled three of its flights to London with
more cancellations expected.
  
In Prague, London-bound customers of Czech Airlines were warned
that some flights Thursday could be cancelled while in Poland,

budget airlines serving British airports followed suit.
  
Strict security measures were being enforced on fligths to and
from England.
  
All cabin baggage was being processed as hold baggage and no

DPA FINANCE Germany Transport Justice  Rival to Ryanair partly wins case against German airport Kiel, 
Germany   
A German airline that competes with low-cost
carrier Ryanair partly won a court challenge Tuesday against the
cut-rate airport fees that have been a secret of the Irish company's
success.
  
Air Berlin had sued small Luebeck Airport, used by Ryanair to
provide services to the port city of Hamburg, 70 kilometres away.
  
In a decision published Tuesday, a state court in Kiel ordered the
airport company to disclose financial transactions that may involve
subsidies to Ryanair.
  
Air Berlin contends that the airport, owned by the municipality of
Luebeck, has not been charging Ryanair commercial rates.
  
A spokeswoman for the BDF association of German airlines called
the ruling a blow to Ryanair's business model, which partly relies on
obtaining low fees at little-known airports that are eager to drum up
travel business.
  
It was the first such case in Germany, but the third in Europe.
  
In a September 2003 case, Ryanair was told to return illegal
subsidies from the French airport of Strasbourg. At the start of
2004, the European Union told Ryanair to refund three-quarters of
subsidies it received from Charleroi airport in Brussels, Belgium.
  
However, the municipality of Luebeck responded that Air Berlin had
failed on five out of seven points that it took to court.

Stansted airport near London, compete with other airlines' operations

DPA FINANCE Ireland Business Aviation  Ryanair announces 80-per-cent rise in quarterly profit Dublin   
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair on Tuesday in Dublin
announced profits of 115.7 million euros (147.3 million dollars) for
the three months to the end of June, an increase of 80 per cent on
the same period last year.
  
Over the same period the airline carried 10.7 million passengers,
representing an increase of 25 per cent on the same quarter last
year.
  
The company's revenues rose from 404.6 million euros in April-June
2005 to 566.6 million euros this year, a rise of 40 per cent.
  
"The underlying causes of these stronger [quarterly] yields was
primarily the presence of Easter in the quarter (and its absence from
the prior year comparable), many more 'sun' destinations, the impact
of competitors' fuel surcharges ... the initial impact of our
baggage-charging initiative and the earlier launch of our new bases
and routes," the company said in a statement.
  
Earlier in the year, Ryanair started charging customers 3.50 euros
for each item of checked-in baggage, but passengers with hand luggage
weighing up to 10 kilograms can now check in online and do not need
to queue at check-in desks at the airport.
  
The new policy has driven down costs, which were reduced by 2 per
cent over the quarter - apart from a 52-per-cent rise in fuel charges
to 167.5 million euros, the company said.
  
Ryanair plans to increase its fleet of aircraft by 27 in the
winter period, compared with 15 new aircraft in the whole of 2005,
but warned that the expansion, coupled with higher-then-expected fuel
prices and "price-dumping" by competitors, would mean "another very
difficult winter trading period."
Ryanair announces 80-per-cent rise in quarterly profit
  
The company forecast that its full-year profits would increase by
between 5 and 10 per cent this financial year. In the last financial
year ended March 31, 2006, Ryanair reported after-tax profits of 302
million euros.

DPA x Britain Transport Aviation Sweden  Ryanair cuts back services to Sweden due to tax burden 
Dublin/London   
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is to cut
back services to Sweden because of a proposed new flight tax, the
airline announced Tuesday.
  
From October 28, the no-frills carrier will scrap its twice-daily
service between Stockholm-Vasteras and Luton, north-east of London.
  
Also, on the same day, Ryanair will reduce its Malmo-Sturup
service to Stansted from twice a day to once a day.
  
Services from Prestwick in Scotland to Gothenburg City Airport in
Sweden will be reduced from five flights a week to three.
  
Ryanair said the Swedish Government's proposed tax would
effectively add a further 30 per cent to the average cost of its
fares.
  
"The Swedish Government is destroying low fare travel for Swedes
and for those people who want to visit this beautiful country,"
Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley said.
  
"The introduction of this tax will make Swedish tourism
uncompetitive when compared with cheaper alternatives in Spain, Italy
and elsewhere in Europe", Cawley added.

DPA FINANCE Sweden Business Aviation  Irish carrier Ryanair to reduce flights to Sweden over new air tax 
Stockholm   
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair said Tuesday it
would discontinue its flights to Sweden's regional Vasteras airport
and would reduce flights from two other airports, citing a newly-
approved environmental tax on air travel.
  
The Swedish parliament approved the tax last month, but it has yet
to come into affect pending a review by the European Commission.
  
However, due to its upcoming autumn scheduling, Ryanair could not
wait for the outcome of the EU decision, Ryanair Nordic head Lotta
Lindquist-Brosjo told Swedish radio.
  
As of October 28, flights from Vasteras, 100 kilometres west of
the Swedish capital, Stockholm would be discontinued.
  
In addition, the twice-daily flights in each direction between
Malmo and London would be reduced to one, and the five weekly flights
from Gothenburg to Glasgow would be reduced to three, Ryanair said.

SPECIAL GUEST: One in five German women would invite Michael Ballack  
to dinner if they had a chance to play host to a member of the  
national team, according to a survey for a television cookery  
programme. 
Twenty-one per cent of those questioned opted for the  
German skipper. Coach Juergen Klinsmann came second on 10 per cent,  
followed by strikers Miroslav Klose (8 per cent) and goalkeeper Jens  
Lehmann on 6 per cent.  
TRAVEL PLANS: England captain David Beckham can imagine ending his  
playing career in the United States but says the time is not ripe for  
such considerations. "That's something for the future. America can  
wait," the 31-year-old told a press conference at England's training  
camp in Buehlertal. Beckham said the planned to continue playing in  
Europe for the next few years.  
CUTTING EDGE: Beckham's wife Victoria dashed from Germany to London  
this week to have a 1,500-pound (2,700 dollar) hairdo so she will  
look good at Saturday's quarter-final match between England and  
Portugal, the Sun newspaper reported. But the 32-year-old ex-Spice  
Girl tried to limit costs on travel by taking budget airline Ryanair  
from Karlsruhe, near Baden-Baden, where she was expected back  
Thursday. During a five-hour appointment with her favourite  
hairdresser, Beckham had a full set of new hair extensions, rolling  
up in an elaborate bun at the back of her head. The Sun said Beckham  
had been "horrified" at pictures taken in Canada last week which  
looked like she had developed a bald patch.  
FAMILY AFFAIRS: Portugal's football family has increased in size  
since the start of the World Cup nearly three weeks ago. Luis Boa  
Morta has just become a father. The 28-year-old, who plays for London  
club Fulham, flew to England to be at the birth of his daughter and  
rejoined the squad on Wednesday. Paulo Ferreira's wife gave birth  
shortly before the country's opening group match against Angola.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair announced on Tuesday  
in Dublin profits of 302 million euros for the financial year to the  
end of March, 12 per cent higher than the previous year and 7  
million euros more than the company had previously estimated.  
Sales increased by 28 per cent on the previous financial year,  
rising from 1.32 billion to 1.69 billion euros, but fuel costs rose  
74 per cent to 462 million euros.  
"Despite these substantially higher fuel costs, Ryanair achieved  
an 18-per-cent after-tax margin, as adjusted net profits increased  
for the year by 12 per cent to 302 million euros," a statement from  
the company said.  
If oil stays at 70 dollars a barrel, Ryanair predicted that its  
profits would rise by between 5 and 10 per cent in the coming  
financial year.  
The number of passengers using the airline increased by 26 per  
cent on the previous 12-month period to 35 million.  
The company predicted that traffic would grow a further 20 per  
cent to 42 million passengers by the end of the current financial  
year.  
"We expect to overtake Lufthansa's international passenger traffic  
later this year, thereby making Ryanair the world's largest  
international scheduled airline by passenger numbers," the statement  
from the company said.  
Ryanair also said it has plans to open a new French base in  
Marseille in November this year and up to two other new bases by the  
spring of 2007.  
ROUNDUP: Ryanair 's profit up 12 per cent to 302 million euros
The company managed to cut costs other than fuel by 5 per cent  
over the year. One example was a modification to current aircraft  
that led to a 2-per-cent reduction in fuel consumption across the  
fleet.  
"This robust performance validates our lowest fare/lowest cost  
model which continues to grow profitably in Europe even during  
adverse market conditions, when many of our competitors are reporting  
losses," Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a  
statement.  
The company has recently retired its older Boeing 737-200 aircraft  
and now claims to have the youngest fleet in Europe, with an average  
age per plane of 2.5 years.  
Ryanair currently has 103 aircraft that fly 330 routes across 22  
countries in Europe and plans to increase its fleet by 30 by April  
2007.  
Launched in the mid-1980s, Ryanair was Europe's first "no frills"  
airline that aimed to undercut national carriers on European routes.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair announced on Tuesday  
in Dublin profits of 302 million euros for the financial year that  
ended March 31, up 12 per cent from the year before and  
seven million euros more than the company had previously estimated.  
Sales increased by 28 per cent on the previous financial year,  
rising from 1.32 billion to 1.69 billion euros, but fuel costs 74 per  
cent to 462 million euros.  
"Despite these substantially higher fuel costs, Ryanair achieved  
an 18-per-cent after tax margin, as adjusted net profits increased  
for the year by 12 per cent to 302 million euros," a statement from  
the company said.  
The number of passengers using the airline increased by 26 per  
cent on the previous 12-month period to 35 million.

ROUNDUP: British Airways profits soar but costs also rise

British Airways (BA) on Friday announced a 21-per-  
cent rise in pre-tax profits to 620 million pounds (1.2 billion  
dollars) for the financial year ending March 31, 2006.  
Operating profit was reported to be 705 million pounds in London  
Friday, which topped market expectations. Sales increased to 8.52  
billion pounds from 7.7 billion pounds.  
New BA-chief Willie Walsh said he was pleased with the results,  
but added that rising fuel costs and a growing pension deficit  
remained problems that needed to be tackled.  
BA staff, reduced by 14,000 over the past years, received bonus  
payments on the back of the results for the first time in many years.  
But costs were also up, by 8.2 per cent overall. Fuel costs rose  
by 44 per cent over the year to 1.6 billion pounds.  
Walsh said BA expected fuel costs to increase by another 600  
million pounds in the current financial year, up from its previous  
guidance of 400 million pounds, due to the latest rise in oil prices.  
Transatlantic and long-haul operations remain the main factor  
behind BA's improved figures, with new routes being added to India  
and China.  
A recovery in first and business class traffic and new long-haul  
routes had kept planes full, analysts said.  
Some 60 per cent of BA's earnings are made on routes to North  
America and Canada.  
But after drastic cuts in ticket prices, BA's short-haul business  
has also seen a recovery, and is now in profit for the first time in  
ROUNDUP: British Airways profits soar but costs also rise
10 years, according to the company.  
Last month, BA announced fare cuts by more than 50 per cent to 65  
destinations in Europe, in an effort to lure clients away from  
low-cost rivals such as Ryanair and EasyJet.  
Walsh made clear Friday that BA would look at further cost-cutting  
measures in view of a pensions deficit of 2.07 billion pounds, up by  
101 million pounds from a year ago.  
The airline has said it wants to raise the retirement age for its  
pilots from 55 to 60, and to 65 for cabin crew, while injecting 500  
million pounds into the pension scheme.  
Analysts said the growing pension deficit and the value of the  
dollar in important transatlantic business remained major problems  
for the British airline.

Plans to form a large Nordic-based low cost  
airline that may in future take on the likes of Easy Jet or Ryanair  
surfaced Thursday.  
The Norwegian financial daily Finansavisen said Swedish-based Fly  
Me was investigating plans to cooperate with Danish-based Sterling  
Airlines and perhaps also Norway-based Norwegian, citing Norwegian  
investor Christen Ager-Hanssen.  
Ager-Hanssen owns some 16 per cent of Fly Me's shares, making him  
second-largest owner of the Gothenburg-based group.  
A takeover of Sterling Airlines could cost some 2 billion kroner  
(329 million dollars), the report said.  
Sterling is owned by Icelandic investment group FL Group, and  
operates flights to some 40 destinations.  
Fly Me has mainly serviced Swedish destinations, but recently  
started flying to 12 European destinations.  
Last year Sterling merged with Danish low coast carrier, Maersk  
Air, creating Europe's fourth largest low cost airline.  
Fly Me's managing director Fredrik Skanselid told Deutsche Presse-  
Agentur dpa he would not discuss specifics but noted that the company  
earlier this year announced plans to acquire Lithuanian Airlines.  
"Our new owners have said they want to be part of the  
consolidation of low cost airlines," Skanselid said.  
He noted there were some four to six carriers in the Nordic region  
that have similar activities, and as they grow they will sooner or  
later compete with each other, opening up later prospects for mergers

Budget airline EasyJet said Wednesday that its  
half-year losses almost doubled to 40.3 million pounds (72.5 million  
dollars) in the six months to the end of March 2006, due chiefly to a  
49 per cent rise in fuel costs.  
The pre-tax losses compare with a figure of 21.6 million pounds  
for the same period last year.  
However, EasyJet said its performance over the last six months  
was slightly ahead of expectations, and its prospects for the  
full-year had improved.  
"Notwithstanding these uncertainties, we now anticipate full-year  
passenger revenue per seat to be broadly in line with 2005, and  
expect ancillary revenue to grow at around 20 per seat for the  
full-year", EasyJet said.  
Overall, EasyJet said it expected full-year pre-tax profit to be  
10 to 15 per cent higher than in 2005, reaching up to 78.2 million  
pounds.  
EasyJet, which is in stiff competition with Irish rival Ryanair,  
generates most of its revenues and profits in the second half of its  
financial year, when holidaymakers jet off on summer breaks.  
During the first half of the current financial year, a total of  
14.9 million passengers flew with the airline, an increase of 10.1  
per cent on the same period of 2005.

Head of Ireland's Ryanair budget airline Michael O'Leary Tuesday in Warsaw urged the Polish government to 
improve the country's airport infrastructure in a bid to spur further growth in the European Union newcomer's 
booming budget air travel sector.
 O'Leary urged Poland to do away with its inflexible centralised national airport authority, bring an end to centrally 
established airport fees and break the monopoly on airport fuel deliveries.
A second airport for the capital Warsaw was also essential, he said.
 Ryanair is one of five budget airlines competing on the Polish market. Eased labour restrictions in Ireland and 
Great Britain for EU newcomer Poles have led to hundreds of thousands of passengers taking budget flights to get 
to work.
 Budget airlines served some 3.23 million passengers in Poland in 2005, accounting for a 31 per cent share of all 
domestic air passenger traffic for the year and a whopping 18 per cent rise from 2004.
 Other budget airlines operating in Poland include Centralwings, the budget wing of Poland's LOT national flagship 
airline, Hungary's Wizz Air, Slovakia's Sky Europe and Britain's easyJet.
 Statistics show EU newcomer Poland saw a 30 per cent boom in passenger traffic through airports in 2005 over 
the previous year. The growth was the most rapid in Europe. dpa sib sr

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson has filed a lawsuit against no-frills airline Ryanair after it used his face in a 
newspaper advertisement without permission, an aide said Thursday.
 Former Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds, who resigned last month, is also seeking damages over the advertisement 
published in late February under the title "Time to flee the country?"
Persson and Freivalds were each seeking 75,000 kronor (10,000 dollars) in damages according to a lawsuit filed in 
the Stockholm District Court. Both politicians said the advertisement was offensive.
 The advert was launched as a parliament committee was investigating the government's slow response to the 
December 2004 tsunami disaster where more than 500 Swedish nationals died.
 In a separate development, Persson and his wife Anitra Steen, head of the state alcohol monopoly stores, are 
facing a probe over possible violations of work safety laws.
 Prosecutors said they were considering a probe after receiving a complaint from the Swedish Work Environment 
Authority.
 The violation could entail a fine. The probe includes Persson's brother who has been contracted to build a manor-
style house in the countryside, south of Stockholm, for Persson and Steen.
 According to the agency, Persson and his wife had failed to submit a work safety plan for workers building their 
new home.
 Persson told reporters he was "surprised," over the move but said he "wanted to see what the prosecutor decides."
 Persson and Steen have said they look forward to settling into their new home. It is located with a view over a lake 
near Flen, less than an hour by train from Stockholm. dpa lsm sr

Hungary's air traffic continues to rise relentlessly, with new figures released by Budapest Airport on Thursday 
showing a 10-per-cent increase in passenger traffic compared to the same period last year.
 British company BAA at the end of last year bought the rights to run the airport for a record 2.2 billion dollars (1.83 
billion euros), and said it wanted to turn it into a regional hub.
New company head, Chris Woodruff, declared himself satisfied with the results, saying they were particularly 
impressive as "February is often the weakest month."
 6.5 million passengers travelled through the airport in 2004, making it the third busiest airport in Central Europe 
after Vienna and Prague, but in excess of 8 million have travelled over the last year.
 Low-cost airlines have driven the growth, and a new terminal opened last year to deal with this increase.
 Ryanair, one of the few major low-cost players that does not operate flights to Budapest, plans from May this year 
to start flights to Lake Balaton in Hungary, providing a further boost to passenger numbers. dpa ml wjh

Riding a boom in Germany's budget airline business, one of the nation's leading no-frills carriers Air Berlin 
announced plans Wednesday to make its stock market debut.
 Having transformed itself in recent years into Germany's second biggest airline behind Lufthansa, Air Berlin said 
sales surged last year by 17 per cent to 1.22 billion euros (1.5 billion dollars) on the back of a 12.5-per-cent jump in 
passengers to 13.5 million.
"We are going on the stock market because we want to realize our market opportunities," chief executive Joachim 
Hunold said in Berlin.
 He went on to predict that Air Berlin's market share in Europe would double in the coming years.
 For January and February, Air Berlin said passengers grew by 10.6 per cent while capacity increased by one point 
to 68.8 per cent.
 Air Berlin's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) last year were 153 million 
euros. However, the company did not release comparative EBITDA figures.
 No date has been set for the airline to float on the exchange with the group seeing a listing on the bourse as 
helping to underpin its expansion.
 Hunold said that the company had already undertaken a 130-million- euro boost in capital to expand its capital 
base in the run-up to the planned share listing.
 Along with other leading budget carriers such as Easyjet and Ryanair, Air Berlin has moved successfully to carve 
out a new business empire in Germany's giant travel market with Germans considered the world's travel 
champions.
 "If we want to continue to grow amid stiff European competition, we have to position ourselves accordingly on the 
capital side," Hunold said. dpa amc wjh

Low-cost airline Ryanair, announcing profits for the last three months of 2005, said Monday that "very high fuel 
prices" had affected its profitability.
 The Dublin-based carrier said adjusted profits to December 31, after tax, rose to 36.8 million euros (44 million 
dollars) in the third quarter of its financial year, from 34.8 million euros in the same period in 2004.
But the firm said "very high fuel prices" were a "drag on profitability."
 The airline has said it will introduce a charge of 2.50 pounds (4.25 dollars) from March 16 for every item of luggage 
checked in.
 It said passenger numbers in the reporting period grew by 26 per cent.
 The company said its costs would have been reduced overall, but rose by 3 per cent in the quarter primarily due to 
fuel costs rising by 59 per cent.
 "We continue to focus aggressively on costs and anticipate that the cost reductions will continue to partially offset 
the significantly higher oil prices," Ryanair said in a statement.
 Last November, the company said it expected full-year profits, due at the end of March,to come in at around 200 
million euros.
 "We remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fourth quarter," Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said. dpa at ds

The Slovak government Wednesday picked an investment group led by Vienna's airport operator to buy the fast-
growing airports in Bratislava and Kosice.
 The winning bid of 21.2 billion koruna (687 million dollars) in cash and future investments from the TwoOne 
consortium beat a competing offer from a group led by Spain's Albertis Infrastructures.
TwoOne includes Flughafen Wien, Slovak investors and Austria's Raiffeisen bank. Albertis' group included Slovak 
investors and TBI, which operates the Belfast and London Luton airports.
 The groups were finalists in a privatization sweepstakes launched in September for the government's 66 per cent 
stake in Slovakia's largest airports.
 TwoOne won the initial round, beating three other bidders including Albertis.
 But a second round was ordered last month by Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda after government opposition 
leaders cried foul and threatened to block the deal.
 Opponents said TwoOne would give preferential treatment to the Vienna airport at the expense of Bratislava. The 
two airports, 50 kilometres apart, are currently competitors.
 Irish budget carrier Ryanair, which serves Bratislava, also opposed a TwoOne takeover.
 Yet TwoOne has promised to invest billions of koruna to upgrade the Slovak airports and build a rail link between 
the Vienna and Bratislava facilities.
 "We are prepared to take prompt measures … as early as this year," said Flughafen Wien board spokesman 
Herbert Kaufman. "Bratislava airport will be enlarged, modernized and made more comfortable."
 TwoOne's winning bid includes 11.4 billion koruna in cash and 9.8 billion koruna worth of investments for both 
airports by 2010.

 Thanks mainly to budget airline expansions, Bratislava's MR Stefanik Airport handled 13.2 million passengers last 
year, nearly twice as many as in 2004. Kosice's airfield is also growing rapidly.
 TwoOne estimates Bratislava's annual passenger load will rise to 30 million by 2015. dpa ej pmc

The aerospace giant Boeing Company Wednesday reported a doubling in its fourth quarter earnings over the same 
period last year, boosted by demand in Asia and higher deliveries of short range aircraft to discount airlines.
 Net income increased to 460 million dollars.
Sales were up 6.8 per cent to 14.2 billion dollars.
 Discount carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co. and Ryanair Holdings Plc have buoyed orders for the 737 model, 
while economic growth has fuelled travel in China and Asia. Boeing expects 2007 deliveries to rise as much as 13 
per cent.
 "Commercial aerospace is humming along," JB Groh, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Portland, Oregon, was 
quoted as saying by Bloomberg financial news service. "Profit on what they'll be selling in the future is looking better 
than it has for a long time."
 Boeing said it expects to deliver between 440 and 445 commercial aircraft in 2007, with 395 expected for the 
current year. Last year's deliveries were 290 planes.
 Boeing and Toulouse, France-based Airbus, the only makers of commercial planes seating over 100 passengers, 
had a combined tally of 2,057 orders last year, beating the previous record of 1,631 in 1989.
 Boeing has unfilled orders of 1,809 planes, including the 1,002 orders won last year. Boeing's two-year defence 
backlog has swelled to about 80 billion dollars , helped by military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan. Boeing last 
week said it is restructuring its defence division and eliminating jobs in anticipation of a slowdown in spending by

The Slovak government decided Thursday to launch a second round of bidding for state-owned airports in 
Bratislava and Kosice.
 The decision, announced by Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda after a meeting of the government's coalition 
partners, followed pressure from opponents of a government plan to sell the airports to a consortium led by 
Vienna's airport operator.
Dzurinda said new bids would be accepted only from the two highest bidders of the competition's first round.
 Those bidders are the Vienna consortium TwoOne, which includes Slovak investors and Austria's Raiffeisen bank, 
and a consortium led by Spain's Albertis Infrastructures, which includes Slovak investors teamed with the operator 
of the Belfast and London Luton airports TBI.
 Two other bidders eliminated in the first round last month will not be allowed to bid again.
 Last week, Slovak Transport Minister Pavol Prokopovic recommended awarding the contract to TwoOne. The rest 
of the cabinet was expected to agree.
 But opposition leaders in parliament as well as the failed bidder ISAP, which includes the German operators of the 
Cologne-Bonn airport, were threatening to block the sale to TwoOne.
 Another opponent was Irish airline Ryanair, which serves the Bratislava airport.
 Parliament was expected to debate the privatization Friday.
 The main opposition focused on concerns that if TwoOne won, Vienna's airport would gain an upper hand over 
Bratislava. The two airports are 50 kilometres apart and currently compete for service.
 The government has declined comment on media reports that TwoOne offered 6.9 billion koruna (222 million 
dollars) and billions more in investments for the airports. dpa ej wjh

Doubts about the proposed sale of Slovakia's Bratislava and Kosice airports were expressed Monday by a 
government coalition leader, raising the possibility that the huge privatization deal may collapse.
 "We have sufficient reason not to agree with the privatization," parliamentary chairman Pavol Hrusovsky of the 
Christian Democrats (KDH), a partner in the right-wing coalition of Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, told the TASR 
news agency.
 Without giving specifics, Hrusovsky said he wants to discuss KDH's "reservations" with other coalition partners 
before the government makes a final decision in the coming weeks.
Similar doubts have been raised by opposition leaders and one of the losers in last month's bidding for the state-run 
airports. The recommended winner was the TwoOne consortium, led by Vienna's airport operator and its 
investment partners.
 Some opponents fear that the smaller Bratislava airport would suffer if it were run by the operator of the nearby 
Vienna International Airport.
 Ireland's budget airline Ryanair, which currently serves Bratislava, is also against a Vienna airport takeover.
 The controversy began on December 22 when a Transport Ministry committee recommended that the government 
sell its controlling stake in the growing airports to TwoOne for an undisclosed amount.
 Three other bidders - consortiums that include investors and operators of airports in Britain, Germany and Turkey - 
were rejected.
 Transport Minister Pavol Prokopovic and the rest of Dzurinda's cabinet was expected to act on the 
recommendation by the end of January.
 Citing the need to keep the tender confidential, the government has refused to discuss the bids.
Support dwindling for sale of two Slovak airports
 However, Slovak media have reported that TwoOne won the competition by offering 6.9 billion koruna (222 million 
dollars) despite a 9-billion-koruna offer from a group led by the Cologne-Bonn airport.
 The bidding took a political turn recently when opposition leaders Robert Fico of the Smer party and Vladimir 
Meciar of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) said they were against the TwoOne proposal.
 When the process began last year, the European Commission said it would monitor the privatization because of 
unusual tender procedures.
 Now the Cologne-Bonn consortium, ISAP, has threatened to complain to Brussels if TwoOne is finally picked. dpa

A Slovak government coalition leader Monday expressed doubts about the proposed sale of the country's 
Bratislava and Kosice airports, raising the possibility that the huge privatization deal may collapse.
 However, Slovak Transport Minister Pavol Prokopovic told reporters Monday the deal was nearly done and that he 
would recommend the government accept the offer of the TwoOne consortium. TwoOne is led by the operator of 
Vienna's airport.
The mixed messages underscored what could become a tough political battle over the proposed tender. The 
European Commission, which last year said it would monitor the privatization because of unusual tender 
procedures, may also enter the fray.
 Parliament Chairman Pavol Hrusovsky of the Christian Democrats (KDH), a partner in the right-wing coalition of 
Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, was the latest leader to question the airport sell-off.
 "We have sufficient reason not to agree with the privatization," Hrusovsky told TASR news agency.
 Without giving specifics, Hrusovsky said he wanted to discuss KDH's "reservations" with other coalition partners 
before the government made a final decision.
 Doubts over the sale have also been raised by opposition party leaders and by one of the losers in last month's 
bidding for the state-run airports.
 The recommended winner was TwoOne, whose investment partners include Austrian Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB) 
and Slovak finance group Penta.
 But some opponents of the deal fear that the smaller Bratislava airport would suffer if it were run by the operator of 
the nearby Vienna International Airport.
 Ireland's budget airline Ryanair, which currently serves Bratislava, is also against the takeover of the airport by 
TwoOne.
ROUNDUP: Mixed signals from Slovak government over sale of airports
 On Monday, Prokopovic rejected fears that the Bratislava airfield would be monopolized by its larger neighbour 50 
kilometres away in Vienna. He said passenger numbers at Vienna were already far higher than in Bratislava.
 The controversy began on December 22 when a transport ministry committee recommended that the government 
sell its controlling stake in the growing airports to TwoOne for an undisclosed amount.
 Three other bidders - consortiums that include investors and operators of airports in Britain, Germany and Turkey - 
were rejected.
 Prokopovic and the rest of Dzurinda's cabinet was expected to act on the recommendation by the end of January.
 Citing the confidentiality of the tender process, the government has refused to discuss the bids.
 Slovak media reported that TwoOne won the competition by offering 6.9 billion koruna (222 million dollars) and 
billions more in investments, bringing the total bid package to 13.9 billion koruna.
 The ISAP group, led by the Cologne-Bonn airport, reportedly made a higher investment bid of 9 billion koruna.
 The bidding took a political turn recently when opposition leaders Robert Fico of the Smer party and Vladimir 
Meciar of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) said they were against the TwoOne proposal.
 ISAP has threatened to complain to the European Commission if TwoOne is finally picked.
 Fico, meanwhile, has warned that he would push to reverse the privatization if his party gains power in the next 
parliamentary elections in September. dpa ej cb

A total of 120,000 Poles have arrived in Ireland since the EU's May 2004 expansion, and 5,000 new Polish migrant 
workers are expected every month in the near future, Poland's Rzeczpospolita daily reported Friday.
 The Polish invasion is far from ending as Poles comprise some three per cent of Ireland's population of 4 million, 
according to a report headlined "An Immigrant's green dream".
RyanAir, Ireland's budget airline, recently set up new routes to four major Polish cities. The flagship national airline, 
Aer Lingus, is also considering extra connections.
 Ireland was among the few older 15 EU states which opened its labour market to workers from 10 newcomer 
countries immediately after the EU's enlargement last year.
 Vibrant growth in the Celtic Tiger's economy is not the only thing attracting Poles to the Emerald Isle. Migrant 
labourers from the east, who speak just a little English, experience less discrimination than in other EU states, 
according to Rzeczpospolita.
 "If you can speak English relatively well and have 1,000 euro in your pocket for a start, then by all means, come," 
Jacek Piekarz, who has been living in Dublin for 11 months, told Rzeczpospolita.
 With a degree in history, his job as a public servant in Poland earned him only 900 zloty (275 dollars) a month 
without a prayer of a pay rise. In Dublin, Piekarz clears 1,500 euro (1767 dollars) a month as a security guard, 
allowing him to cover living costs and to tuck away savings.
 Poles have already established Polish-language newspapers and churches in Ireland, where Catholicism is deeply 
entrenched. An Irish cable TV channel is also broadcasting Polish-language programming.
 An estimated 50,000 Lithuanians have also taken advantage of their new-found status as EU citizens to live and 
work in Ireland. dpa sib pb sc

Operators of airports in Vienna, Istanbul, Cologne and Belfast submitted bids Monday for two fast-growing Slovak 
airports slated for sale by the government.
 A Slovak transportation ministry spokesman named the finalists but gave no details on the bids for the MR Stefanik 
Airport in the capital, Bratislava, and Kosice Airport in the east.
The government plans to name a winner by the end of the year, said spokesman Tomas Sarluska.
 Bidding for the government's 66 per cent stake in each airport are Airport TwoOne, an Austrian-Slovak consortium 
led by Vienna's airport operator Flughafen Wien, and ISAP, a Slovak-Austrian-German consortium that includes the 
operator of the Cologne-Bonn airport.
 Also bidding are Turkey's TAV, which runs Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, and a group led by Spain's Albertis 
Infrastructures that includes Slovak investors teamed with the operator of the Belfast and London Luton airports 
TBI.
 A consortium of France's Vinci Concessions and Austria's Away bowed out of the race last month following media 
reports that they may have broken tender rules by working with the Austrian bank Raiffeisen, which is also backing 
Airport TwoOne.
 Sarluska said a government commission agreed with a recommendation of its privatization adviser Meinl Bank to 
exclude Vinci-Away but allow Airport TwoOne to compete.
 TwoOne is considered a leading bidder thanks to its plan to link airports in Vienna and Bratislava, about 50 
kilometres apart. However that plan is opposed by one of Bratislava biggest airlines, Ireland's budget carrier 
RyanAir.
 The Bratislava and Kosice airports have been expanding rapidly. After handling a combined 1 million passengers 
last year, mainly through budget airlines, the Bratislava field saw traffic increase 50 per cent in the first half of this 
year while Kosice's passenger traffic rose 14 per cent. dpa ej tc

Irish budget airline Ryanair Monday revealed an 18 per cent rise in profits, despite a doubling in fuel prices, for the 
first six months of 2005.
 The Dublin-based carrier posted record net profits of 237 million euros (279 million dollars), but said it remained 
cautious about its outlook for the full year.
Ryanair said its decision not to impose a fuel surcharge like many of its rivals helped it increase the number of 
passengers carried during the period by 29 per cent to 18 million.
 Fuel costs had increased by 108 per cent in the six months to September 30 and were expected to remain at these 
high levels "for some time", Ryanair said.
 Meanwhile Monday, budget rival EasyJet reported a rise in passenger figures for October, bringing the total of 
passengers carried between October 2004 and October 2005 to 29.9 million.
 However, the airline said that its load factor - which shows how full the planes are - fell to 85.6 per cent in October

Convinced that Eastern Europe's market is taking off, some of the biggest guns in the European airport industry 
have set sights on a pair of small airports located at opposite ends of Slovakia.
 Five companies, including the operators of airports in Vienna, Cologne, Belfast and Istanbul, are on the Slovak 
government's short list for the privatization of the MR Stefanik Airport in the capital
 Bratislava and the Kosice Airport in the country's east.
 Financial details of the offers are closely guarded secrets. The government is expected to select a winner next 
month.
Tomas Sarluska, spokesman for the Slovak transport ministry, declined to discuss financials except to say, "The 
price will be generated in the international tender."
 And a spokesman for the British bidder TBI, who requested anonymity, said the bidding is "very commercially 
sensitive. It's all going to come down to price and proposal, and nobody's giving anything away."
 That so much interest has been generated by two airports which handled only about 1 million passengers last year 
-- mainly through budget airlines -- is indicative of the enormous potential seen for air travel in and through 
Slovakia.
 The small country is a new European Union member where foreign firms like Korean automaker Kia and America's 
U.S. Steel are investing billions of dollars.
 Bratislava is rising in status as a sister city to much larger Vienna, just 50 kilometres away. Stefanik Airport is also 
just a short flight from busy airports in Budapest and Prague.
 The Stefanik airfield posted a 49 per cent increase in passengers for the first half of this year, to more than 
680,000. Next week it will get a new daily connection to Milan via budget carrier Ryanair. The airport is also the 
base for Slovakia's homegrown discount airline SkyEurope and a traditional link for Germany's Lufthansa and 
Czech Air.
NEWS FEATURE: Industry's big guns target small Slovak airports
 Kosice's small airport is in a growing manufacturing region and a gateway to Slovakia's huge eastern neighbour 
Ukraine. For the first eight months of this year, the airport posted a 14 per cent increase in passengers.
 The TBI spokesman noted, "Eastern Europe is going to be an expanding airline market. It's all about market 
potential."
 Equally aware of the economic potential is the government, which plans to keep a 14 per cent stake in each airport 
after selling off the controlling 66 per cent and giving away 10 per cent stakes to local governments.
 Indeed, the government recently rejected a recommendation of its airport privatization advisor, Meinl Bank, to sell 
80 per cent stakes.
 Particularly keen on developing Bratislava's air market in tandem with Vienna is a bidder called Airport TwoOne, an 
Austrian-Slovak consortium led by Vienna's airport operator Flughafen Wien.
 A consortium press statement cited "major opportunities for the economic development of the Vienna and 
Bratislava Airports based on the strong impulses for growth in the Vienna-Lower Austria-Bratislava region."
 TwoOne has proposed linking the Vienna and Bratislava airports by rail and coordinating flights to serve a 
combined regional load of 30 million passengers annually by 2015, compared with about 16 million today.
 After privatization, the Bratislava airfield may get a new terminal and other upgrades. It's also being eyed by U.S. 
aircraft maker Boeing as a possible site for pilot training.
 Some experts have predicted that in a few years Bratislava, despite a population of less than 500,000, could be 
handling 5 million airline passengers annually.
 But exactly how the two airports will develop after privatization won't be known until after the government picks a 
winning bid next month.
 Aside from TwoOne, none of the companies on the government's short list agreed to explain their proposals to 
Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.
 The other four are: France's Vinci Concessions, a manager of 17 airports and global supplier of baggage systems; 
the Slovak-Austrian-German consortium ISAP, which includes the operator of the Cologne-Bonn airport; TAV, 
which runs Istanbul's Ataturk Airport; and a group that includes Belfast and London Luton airports operator TBI, its 
Spanish parent Albertis, and Slovak investors.
 Initially some 49 companies showed interest in the Slovak airports, including Austrian Airlines and the operator of 
Copenhagen's airport.
 Most of those who showed early interest bowed out on their own accord, and now the five finalists must wait to 
hear whether they'll get this prime piece of Eastern Europe's air market. dpa ej pmc

Low cost airline Ryanair says it is poised to link the island to 26 destinations including Seville, Oslo and Salzburg, if

 Michael Cawley, Ryanair's deputy chief executive officer, told reporters in Malta Tuesday that Malta International 
Airport must first lower its landing charges from 19 euros per passenger it has offered to charge all airlines 
operating to certain destinations to around 7.50 euros - the average charged by other European airports.
 Cawley said Ryanair could create up to 2,000 jobs in and around the airport within three years if the Maltese 
authorities cooperated, basing six aircraft on the island in return for a low-cost deal which would "save" Maltese 
tourism.
 The island attracts some 1.1 million tourists a year, but average tourist spending is down, and stays are becoming

Scotland Yard Wednesday appeared to be closing the net on the terrorist cell involved in last Thursday's failed 
London bombings with the arrest of four men, believed to include a chief bombing suspect.
 According to unconfirmed reports, 24-year-old Somalian Yasin Hassan Omar, is among the men arrested in early 
morning raids in Birmingham, central Britain.
 Omar, who came to Britain as a 12-year-old and lived in the country legally, was named by police as one of the 
chief suspects in last Thursday's failed attacks, along with Muktar Said Ibrahim, a 27- year-old man from Eritrea.
Neighbours watching the massive police operation in the Hay Mills district of Birmingham early Wednesday said 
they had heard the name "Hassan" being shouted twice during the raids.
 Witness Katy Stewart said she had seen four men "coming and going regularly" in a car over the last two weeks.
 Last Saturday, two days after the failed attacks, the men had arrived with large black bags with quilts and pillows 
hanging out of the top of them.
 "They would come at 2 a.m. and then when you looked in the morning, the car had gone", she said.
 Police said one of the men, believed to be Omar, had carried a rucksack during his arrest, which was preceded by 
a "tussle."
 Police said a Taser gun, discharging electric shocks, had been used in the arrest, but no firearms were deployed.
 One of the men, believed to be Omar, had been taken to London for questioning at a high-security police station.
 Omar, and Ibrahim were believed to have returned to a hide-out flat in London a day after the failed attacks.
 Police said they had found "large amounts of chemicals" that could be used to make bombs during raids on the flat 
in a tower block in north London.
1ST ROUNDUP: Scotland Yard closes net on terror suspects
 Late Tuesday, police arrested two men on a train from Newcastle in northern Britain, to London. But it was not 
immediately clear whether they were directly linked to the attacks.
 A man was also arrested, but later released, during a security alert at Luton airport, north of London, Wednesday.
 Police imposed a temporary air exclusion zone over the airport, used mainly by budget and charter airlines. It was 
understood that the man was boarding a Ryanair flight to Nimes, in France.
 The hectic police activities followed a warning from London police chief Ian Blair that the bombers could be 
preparing another attack on the capital.
 Blair said there had been 250 suicide bomb scares in London since the major terrorist attack on underground 
(tube) trains and a bus on July 7, in which 56 people died and 700 were injured.
 Exactly two weeks later, on July 21, the capital was again on terror alert as four would-be suicide bombers placed 
rucksacks containing explosives on tube trains and a bus, which, however, failed to explode.
 Experts said that if it was confirmed that one of the would-be bombers was among those arrested Wednesday, and 
if that person was prepared to cooperate with police, "this could be the beginning of the end" of the clampdown on 
those responsible.
 The arrests came as Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed terrorism in separate talks in London with Turkish Prime 
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Spanish Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.

Scotland Yard Wednesday appeared to be closing the net on the terrorist cell involved in last Thursday's failed 
London bombings with the arrest of four men, believed to include chief suspect Yasin Hassan Omar.
 According to TV reports, but not so far confirmed by the police, the 24-year-old Somali is among the men arrested 
in early morning raids in Birmingham, central Britain, Wednesday.
 Blair said he was "greatly heartened" by the arrests which he described as an "important development" in the terror 
investigations.
 He praised the police for their "exemplary hard work and commitment" in the task of tracking down the bombers.
Omar, who came to Britain as a 12-year-old and lived in the country legally, was named by police as one of the 
chief suspects in last Thursday's failed attacks, along with Muktar Said Ibrahim, a 27- year-old man from Eritrea.
 Neighbours watching the massive police operation in the Hay Mills district of Birmingham early Wednesday said 
they had heard the name "Hassan" being shouted twice during the raids.
 Witness Katy Stewart said she had seen four men "coming and going regularly" in a car over the last two weeks.
 Last Saturday, two days after the failed attacks, the men had arrived with large black bags with quilts and pillows 
hanging out of the top of them.
 "They would come at 2 a.m. and then when you looked in the morning, the car had gone", she said.
 Police said one of the men, believed to be Omar, had carried a rucksack during his arrest, which was preceded by 
a "tussle."
 Police said a Taser gun, discharging electric shocks, had been used in the arrest, but no firearms were deployed.
 One of the men, believed to be Omar, had been taken to London for questioning at a high-security police station.

Share values dropped sharply on stock markets around Europe on Thursday, with insurance and travel company 
stocks particularly taking a blow, in the wake of the series of bomb explosions in London.
 While Europe's main markets had shed two to four per cent as of early afternoon, politicians urged calm and kept 
in touch with finance market authorities to monitor developments.
 In Berlin, German Finance Minister Hans Eichel called for calm and said that finance ministers around Europe were 
staying in contact with central bank authorities.
"We should not contribute to the situation getting out of control by taking the wrong actions and reacting in panic," 
Eichel said about the repercussions of the bomb attacks.
 "This is not going to unhinge the world economy," he said, noting that such price fluctuations as seen on the 
markets did not come as a surprise.
 As of early afternoon, London's FTSE-100 index was down 3.4 per cent to 5053 points, with British Airways shares 
falling nearly 6 per cent to 256 pence.
 In Paris, the CAC-40 was almost 3.8 per cent lower at 4119 points, whilc the EuroSTOXX 50 index had lost around 
4.3 per cent by early afternoon.
 In Frankfurt, the 30-share benchmark DAX had fallen around 3 per cent to 4480 points. Travel concern TUI 
plunged over 7.7 per cent to 19.45 euros, with a company spokesman calling the reaction of investors "irrational".
 Lufthansa stocks had lost 4.6 per cent to 9.71 euros and reinsurer Munich Re dropped 5.4 per cent to 84.30 euros.
 On the secondary MDAX index in Frankfurt, low-fare carrier Ryanair lost 6.5 per cent to six euros.
 Gold prices meanwhile jumped in a typical market reaction to a sudden crisis. The fine ounce in London gained to 
429.05 dollars, after opening at 423.50 dollars.

The Lithuanian government appears set finally to sell its loss-making national air carrier Lietuvos Avialinijos (LAL) at 
the second attempt, and to catch up with its Baltic neighbours which privatised their airlines several years ago.
 The Lithuanian State Property Fund initialled an agreement for the sale of a 100 per cent stake of the country's 
national air carrier Lietuvos Avialinijos (LAL) last week, and plans to finalise the deal by the end of July.
 So far the fund has not officially disclosed the name of the investor, but Fima, Lithuania's leading electronics and 
engineering systems solutions company, said it won the tender, outbidding three other competitors.
 Fima says it offered to pay over 20 million litai (7.05 million dollars) for LAL and to invest up to 28 million litai into 
the company.
According to the privatisation conditions the potential investor was obliged to boost LAL's authorised capital by no 
less than 10 million litai within two years.
 "Lithuanian Airlines will become profitable within three-to-four years," says Vaidas Barakauskas, president of Fima. 
"It will to be a serious competitor for both Baltic and central European airlines."
 "We want to create a totally new concept for economy flights and to offer more high quality services for a low 
price," says Barakauskas.
 While Firma's chief executive says that LAL will offer low-fare flights, these would be different kind of services 
compared to those currently offered on the market.
 Because LAL will retain its status as national carrier, the airline's new owner also expects the government support 
in the competition.
 A major part of the planned investment programme will be the acquisition and lease of new aircraft, the 
construction of a new hangar, which will service more clients and ensure an additional 3.5 million litai in revenue 
annually.
NEWS FEATURE: Sale of Lithuanian Airlines nears end
 According to Barakauskas there is also a big potential for boosting cargo services.
 In addition, the group is planning introduce greater automation into the airline as well as installing an electronic 
luggage control system, internet ticket sale network and a call centre.
 To ensure the success in revamping LAL, Fima has signed cooperation agreements with a Lithuanian charter flight 
company Aurela and Tez Tour, an international travel agency of Russian capital, which specialises in organising 
tours to Egypt, Thailand and Turkey.
 Aurela, which has Boeing 737-300, JAK-42D and Hawker HS125-700 type aircraft, flies to European, Asian and 
African countries.
 Along with three Lithuanian companies and consortiums, an Icelandic investor Fengur, which runs cheap flight 
companies Icelandic Express and Sterling were competing to buy LAL.
 LAL, which at the start of this year represented 48 per cent of regular flights operating from Vilnius airport, is facing 
an increased competition in the coming months from Ryanair.
 The Irish low-fare airline is planning to launch flights from Karmelava airport near the nation's second-largest city of 
Kaunas.
 Under the deal to buy LAL, Fima is to retain no less than 80 per cent of the airline's jobs for one year and will not 
be allowed to trade the stock of the company without the permission of the government for two years.
 The new owner will have to take over LAL's debt of about 30 million litas.
 LAL, which suffered a net loss of nine million litai in 2004, has forecast a 3.95 million litai profit this year.
 The number of travellers jumped last year by 41.7, while sales rose 11.6 per cent to 222 million litai.
 The airline has also entered 2005 on stroing footing with the number of LAL passengers jumping by 43.9 per cent

Poland has emerged as Europes fastest growing airline market on the wings of an influx of budget carriers, with 
analysts noting ample room for further growth.
 In 2004, its first year as an member of the European Union, Poland saw 9 million air travellers, a 26-per-cent 
increase over the previous year.
The boom appears to be in full swing with passenger traffic at Warsaws Frederick Chopin International Airport, 
Polands largest, up to 1.3 million during the first three months of the year, the Gazeta Wyborcza daily reported 
Thursday.
 The figure represents a nearly 25-per-cent increase over the same period last year.
 Regional airports, however, are flying even higher with fresh passengers drawn by budget carriers.
 Wizz Airs selection of the Pyrzowice Airport in the populous southern Polish Silesian coal basin as a base has paid 
off.
 Passenger traffic during the first quarter of this year soared by 400-per-cent compared to the same period last 
year. Robust growth was also recorded at Krakows Balice airport and at Lech Walesa Airport in the Polish Baltic 
port city of Gdansk.
 Polands Civil Aviation Authority predicts over 11 per cent growth in Polands air travel market per year between 
2006-09. While statistics show that more than 20 per cent of Britons and Germans travel by air, in Poland the figure 
remains at a low 3 per cent
 EasyJet, Centralwings, SkyEurope, RyanAir, Wizz Air, Aerlingus, German Wings are among the budget carriers 
flying high on the Polish market.
 Established carriers such as the Polish national airline LOT, Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways, KLM or Air 
France also appear to be benefiting from the air travel boom, according to Gazeta. dpa sib wjh

Rising prosperity, fast-paced market deregulation and an expanding travel industry have helped to trigger a 
revolution in the skies over Central and Eastern Europe.
 Just over a year after the European Union (E.U.) was expanded to take in eight new Central and Eastern European 
(CEE) members, no- frills airlines are starting to replace schedule carriers as the major form of air travel and the 
Czech capital Prague is emerging as a major new hub for the budget aviation business.
 Currently about 14 low-cost airlines fly into the Czech Republic with about five budget carriers jetting into Prague 
each day and as a result helping to boost tourist numbers in Europe's sixth-most visited city by a forecast of 10 per 
cent this year.
 With Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) growing as a tourist destination and incomes rising in the wake of E.U. 
membership in May last year, the region's travel market is forecast to turn in solid growth in the coming years.
Indeed, the CEE budget airline boom has also lead to the emergence of a raft of home-grown no-frills carriers with 
airlines such as Romania's Air Blue, the Czech Republic's Smart Wings, Hungary's Wizz Air, Poland's Central 
Wings and Slovakia's SkyEurope Airlines currently criss-crossing Europe and competing with bigger rivals, 
including market leaders EasyJet and Ryanair.
 Already parts of CEE are becoming key new competitors for the more established travel markets in Western 
Europe, consequently forcing some of the more prominent budget airline groups to abandon their wait-and-see 
approach to the new E.U. member states and to take the plunge in the region's new markets.
 At the same time, governments across the CEE region have been moving to upgrade and to refurbish their airports 
to accommodate their new budget airline operators.
 The number of tourists travelling from Britain to Prague is forecast to jump by 30 per cent in 2005 with UK-based 
Easyjet and Ireland's Ryanair now flying into the Czech Republic from a range of destinations throughout Britain.
 With tourism rapidly developing as a key part of the Czech Republic's economy following the fall of communism in 
1989, about 80 per cent of the Prague workforce is now directly or indirectly involved in the tourist trade.
NEWS FEATURE: CEE market deregulation sparks revolution in the skies
 About 11 or 12 new hotels are opening in Prague each year with the number of overnight stays in the Czech capital 
hitting 10 million last year in a city of about 1.2 million.
 This has sparked growing concerns that the sheer volume of visitors and often catastrophic traffic could be 
damaging Prague's historic heart. "The centre of Prague is overwhelmed," conceded Czech Tourism chief Miroslav 
Roncak.
 Billing itself as Central Europe's first low-fare airline, SkyEurope Airlines now carries about 50 per cent of air 
travellers using Bratislava airport. At the same time, four-year old SkyEurope Airlines is launching 10 new routes 
and has ordered 32 Boeing 737-700 aircraft to be delivered over the next three years.
 Up until the arrival of SkyEurope, Slovakia, which was forged only 12 years ago following the break-up of 
Czechoslovakia, did not have its own national carrier.
 Hungary's Wizz Air, which has just marked its first anniversary and is one of about eight low-cost airlines servicing 
the new E.U. member state, is currently in the process of expanding its routes.
 A recent report prepared by accountancy group KPMG found that about 14 per cent of Hungarians who plan to 
travel abroad in 2005 will use budget airlines, compared to five per cent last year.
 But with only about three per cent of Poles flying regularly and wages expected to rise soon following the nation's 
recent run of solid economic expansion, analysts see the market, which is Central Europe's biggest economy 
offering strong growth potential.
 The number of passengers handled by Warsaw's main airport raced ahead by 18 per cent last year.
 In March, Ryanair added to its flights to Central European destinations such as Brno in the Czech Republic and the 
Latvian capital, Riga by launching regular services to Poland.
 Apart from beefing up competition in the region's expanding budget airline business, analysts expect the Dublin-
based carrier's new Polish connection to represent a step in its no-frills airline's expansion across Central Europe. 
At present, there are about seven low-cost carriers servicing Poland.
 "If the number of flights increases in the Central and Eastern Europe region, we will set up a regional hub," said 
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary.
 In the meantime, Ryanair's arch-rival Easyjet has also mapped out a network of destinations across the region with 
flights to Poland's capital, Warsaw and the nation's historic city of Krakow as well as Bratislava, Budapest, 
Ljubljana, Riga and Tallinn. dpa amc sr

Russian airlines no longer rule the skies over the Baltic countries. The times when Lithuanians, Latvians and 
Estonians had to travel via Moscow have gone for good.
 European budget airlines are competing for the growing market for cheap foreign travel.
"Before accession to the European Union, the market was undersupplied. New routes and airlines offering lower 
prices are boosting passenger numbers considerably," says Yannis Capodistrias, spokesman for Easyjet.
 In 2004 the airport of the Latvian capital Riga had to cope with twice as many passengers as in the previous year.
 Now expansion plans proceeding at a rapid pace are intended to raise capacity to cope with the 2 million 
passengers expected this year.
 Riga airport spokesman Andorijs Darzins says quality would be maintained, despite the furious rate of growth.
 There are two aspects to this travel boom. Riga is regarded as the "Pearl of the Baltic" and also renowned for its 
Art Nouveau architecture.
 Expanded travel facilities are allowing eastern Europeans to visit the West without the need for visas.
 The flights are also bringing in tourists from the older members of the E.U. who come to experience what was 
closed off behind the Iron Curtain not so long ago.
 The flights throw together odd travelling companions - Eastern Europeans working on the black market alongside 
Western pensioners in search of a new travel experience.
 Airbaltic, the largest airline servicing the region advertises with the slogan that "the Europe without borders is 
growing closer together above the clouds".
 The company, operated by SAS in cooperation with the Latvian state, contributed to deregulation with its low prices 
over the Internet even before Latvia joined the E.U. a year ago.
FEATURE: Baltic airports are taking off in the wake of E.U. accession
 When Ryanair joined the battle for passengers to and from Riga, the airport was forced to cut its landing fees even 
further.
 "We aim to be a hub," says Arnis Muiznieks, who works in the air section of the Transport Ministry.
 By contrast, Bertolt Flick, the head of Airbaltic notes that the "myth" of Riga as an airport for passengers in transit 
has long been cultivated, even though only a couple of hundred passengers fly on to Vilnius and Tallinn, the 
nearest airports of any size.
 "Passengers want to fly directly from one place to another," Flick says.
 People in the sector are now watching events in Vilnius, where the Lithuanian government is attempting to privatize 
the state-owned Lithuanian Airlines.
 Travel experts take the view that there is still room for expansion, despite the rapid growth of the recent past. That 
growth took place from a low base, they say.
 In line with these expectations, the airports at Vilnius and Tallinn are also working on expansion plans. dpa jl rpm

Irish budget airline Ryanair has abandoned a trial scheme of paid-for in-flight entertainment due to poor customer 
demand.
 The airline said Monday it ended the service of films and music at an extra cost of five pounds (nine dollars) per 
flight after six months.
The no-frills carrier said an initial lack of availability of non-English language content programmes had contributed 
to the "disappointing" trial.
 When Ryanair launched the scheme, chief executive Michael O,Leary reportedly described it as "the next 
revolution in the low fares airline industry" and said Ryanair expected to make enormous sums of money from it.
 The company had hoped to have its entire fleet of more than 90 aircraft equipped by last month.
 One industry analyst said he believed one of the problems of the scheme had been that flights were too short.
 The Dublin-based group and other low-cost airlines have been searching for extra revenue earners in the face of 
tough conditions in the cut-throat European short-haul market. dpa at pmc

Irish budget airline Ryanair said Thursday it was planning to set up a new European hub in Luebeck, on north-west 
Germany's Baltic coast.
 The Dublin-based carrier said it intended to invest more than 250 million euros (319 million dollars) to create a 
base at Luebeck, near Hamburg, for up to four new Boeing 737 jets operating 10 routes.
The move would eventually create up to 2,000 jobs and generate up to two million passengers a year through the 
airport, Ryanair said.
 Realisation of the plans depends on a deal with the prospective new owner of Luebeck airport, New Zealand-based 
infrastructure investment group Infratil, Ryanair said.
 The expected increase in passenger traffic would lift Luebeck into the top ten international airports in Germany, the 
company said. dpa at ms

The drive to open up the skies over Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is set to take another step forward Thursday 
when Ireland's budget airline Ryanair launches regular flights to Poland.
 With CEE growing as a tourist destination and incomes expected to rise across the region in the wake of eight 
Central European and Baltic states signing up to the European Union (E.U.) in May last year, the region's travel 
market is forecast to turn in solid growth in the coming years.
 Already parts of the region are emerging as new competitors for the more established travel markets in western 
Europe.
 When Ryanair begins flying from London Stansted to Wroclaw Thursday it will also substantially beef up 
competition in the CEE expanding budget airline business with analysts expecting the new Polish connection to be 
represent a step in the Dublin-based no-frills carrier's expansion across the region.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary believes that if the airline can secure a booking rate of 75 per cent then it should be 
able to break even on the Wroclaw flights in three months. At present, there are about seven low-cost carriers 
servicing Poland.
 "If the number of flights increases in the CEE, we will set up a regional hub," said O'Leary with a spokeswoman for 
the group saying that the airline was constantly negotiating with airports as part of possible expansion.
 Ryanair already flies to Brno in the Czech Republic and the Latvian capital, Riga. The Czech Republic currently 
has about 14 low-cost airlines services.
 Hungary's low-cost carrier Wizzair, which is one of about eight low-cost airlines servicing the new E.U. member 
state, is currently planning to introduce five new destinations by the summer.
 At the same time, SkyEurope Airlines, which bills itself as Central Europes first low-fare airline is hoping to increase 
in frequencies to most of the existing destinations as well as launching 10 new routes.
NEWS FEATURE: Budget airline rivalry intensifies in eastern Europe
 This includes connections between several Central European hubs to Athens, Barcelona, Copenhagen, 
Manchester and Nice.
 Now in the fourth year of its business, SkyEurope, which has bases in Vienna-Bratislava, Budapest, Krakow and 
Warsaw, carried more than one million passengers over the last 12 months with load factor averaging 73 per cent 
to 19 destinations in 12 countries.
 Ryanair's arch-rival Easyjet also has mapped out a network of destinations across the CEE markets with flights to 
the Poland's capital, Warsaw and the nation's historic city of Krakow as well as Bratislava, Budapest, Ljubljana, 
Riga and Tallinn.
 Dublin-based Ryanair, which hopes to build up a service of about 100,000 passengers on its new Britain to Poland 
route, could also expect to face some stiff competition from Polish home-grown budget carrier, Centralwings.
 Operated by national Polish flag carrier, Lot, Centralwings has forged a deal to cooperate with Germanwings, an 
offshoot of the German flag carrier, Lufthansa.
 With only about three per cent of Poles flying regularly and wages expected to start to catching up soon with the 
nation's recent run of solid economic growth, analysts see the market, which is Central Europe's biggest economy 
as offering possible growth potential.
 The number of passengers handled by Warsaw's main airport raced ahead by 18 per cent last year.
 That said, the Polish market has not been without its problems. Last year Poland's first low-cost carrier, Air Polonia 
shut its doors.
 And earlier this month, Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline, announced plans to drop all flights to Poland, 
due to what it said was a lack of demand.
 Air Berlin had previously flown between Dusseldorf and Warsaw and Vienna and Warsaw as well as Berlin and the 
Polish capital. dpa amc sc emc

Beware of turning up at the airline check-in desk with too much luggage: that extra weight can slice a huge portion 
from your travel budget.
 Several major airlines charge hefty fees for those extra kilos in the suitcase - to the annoyance of consumer 
organizations.
 "It bears no proportion to the price of the ticket," says Beate Wagner of a German consumer rights group.
Travellers really have no choice but to keep their luggage to the required minimum. Once you are at the airport 
protests are to no avail.
 "Some airlines are tolerant, but they are not obliged to transport unlimited passenger luggage," Wagner says.
 Permitted luggage weight limits are usually listed on the airline ticket, and travellers should make sure they have 
read the small print, Wagner says.
 In economy class, the weight limit is normally 20 kilograms per passenger. During a stay of 29 days and longer the 
limit is mostly 30 kilos. Business and first class passengers can have more luggage. Flights to the United States 
usually also have higher weight limits.
 The ceiling for hand luggage is meanwhile normally between six and ten kilos.
 Most airlines allow a few extra kilos at the check-in counter but many airlines offering cheap discount flight are 
much stricter. For instance, the Irish budget carrier Ryanair allows only 15 kilos per passenger. Every extra kilo 
costs 7 euros (9.3 dollars).
 Fees for extra luggage vary from airline to airline. Charter flights charge between 3 and 8 euros for every kilo.
 Most other airlines charge the 1.5 per cent that was agreed by members of the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA). Passengers pay 1.5 per cent of the economy class tariff for each extra kilo.
Airlines cash in on extra luggageBy Jan Kuhlmann, dpa
 The basis of calculation is not the actual price of the ticket but the price of a single flight to the same destination 
under the most flexible conditions. That is in most cases the most expensive ticket.
 It is not unusual for passengers to pay more than 30 euros for each extra kilo. One extra kilo on a Lufthansa flight 
from Frankfurt to Bangkok can cost 38 euros.
 Airlines reject the accusation of over-pricing.
 "Luggage space is expensive," says Lufthansa spokesman Bernd Hoffmann. "Sometimes the effort (of taking more 
luggage) is huge and not seen by the passenger."
 If the luggage hold is filled the airline sometimes has to buy luggage space from another seller. At short notice it 
gets expensive. Aircraft with more luggage also use more fuel.
 But strong competition among airlines has led to many carriers transporting sports equipment at special conditions.
 Charter airlines transport golf or diving equipment up to a weight of 30 kilograms without extra charge. A bicycle or 
surfboard costs between 30 and 60 euros extra. It is, however, better to ask the airline before starting the trip.
 If a passenger needs that extra luggage it is often much cheaper to transport it as cargo. Lufthansa in such cases 
refers its customers to its cargo subsidiary.
 Similar services are offered by logistics companies. Generally such luggage should be checked in several days 
before the customer's flight. dpa gms jku fo cr rg bw ct

Irish budget airline Ryanair Tuesday posted a better-than-expected increase in profits for the first half of its 
business year.  Europe's biggest low-cost airline said net income grew 18 per cent to a record 200.1 million euros 
(255.25 million dollars) in the six months to the end of September, compared to 168.9 million euros in the same 
period a year ago.  The Dublin-based carrier said profits for the second quarter increased 15 per cent, with net 
income rising to 147.6 million euros from 128.4 million euros a year earlier.  The result was better than analysts' 
forecasts of some 130 million euros for the three months until the end of September and around 187 million euros 
for the first six months.  Higher passenger numbers - up by 24 per cent to 14 million in the second quarter - helped 
the no-frills airline increase its turnover by 21 per cent to 721.1 million euros.  But the carrier said its outlook for the 
rest of the year was "cautious" because of the high price of oil.  "These record traffic and profit figures show just 
how robust Ryanair's 'lowest fares' model remains even in a very difficult economic environment characterized by 
record fuel prices and intense price competition," Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said in a statement.  
O'Leary said "disciplined route growth" was central to the airline's record earnings, with 41 new routes opened 
during the summer season and two new bases in Barcelona and Rome exceeding expectations.
Five new destinations join the airline's programme during the winter: Riga, Latvia; Santander, Seville and Valencia 
in Spain; and Porto, Portugal.  O'Leary forecast rival low-cost airlines would be "doomed" the longer the price of oil 
staid around 50 dollars a barrel.  "Our prediction of a bloodbath and airline casualties this winter may be 
accelerated by record high oil prices as well as irrational competition," he said.  Ryanair can absorb much higher oil 
prices than competitors thanks to "world record margins" and without resorting to surcharges, he said. dpa bw emc

Malaysia's AirAsia has shelved plans to start a budget airline in Singapore after rivals were given licences first 
although AirAsia applied earlier, Southeast Asia's largest no-frills carrier said on Wednesday.  "No one in Singapore 
ever replied to us (about the air operator's certificate), so we take it as Singapore did not want AirAsia," chief 
executive Tony Fernandes told the daily newspaper Streats.
"So we have taken our investment elsewhere," he added.  AirAsia recently entered the Indonesian market, buying 
defunct airline PT AWAir for a token 2 U.S. dollars.  The carrier had applied for an air operator's certificate (AOC) in 
January. Fernandes said then its Singapore carrier would initially use two Boeing 737 aircraft to operate between 
18 and 32 daily flights to six regional destinations.  Tiger Airways, owned by Singapore Airlines, the government's 
investment arm Temasek Holdings, the founders of RyanAir, and a U.S. partner, started operations last month. It 
applied for the licence in March.  Qantas-backed Jetstar Asia expects its licence early next month after handing in 
its application paper after AirAsia.  The Civil Aviation Authority issued a statement saying it "prioritised the process 
of the various AOC applications based on the value-add and benefits the potential carrier can bring to Changi 
Airport and Singapore." AirAsia has been building up its hub in Johor and currently operates 63 flights a week. The 
carrier launched Malaysia's biggest IPO for this year last week, aimed at raising 272 million U.S. dollars to fund 
regional expansion. dpa ry gj

Tiger Airways boss Patrick Gan, in confirming he is leaving the budget airline, said in published remarks on 
Saturday the decision did not stem from problems with the board of directors.  "New opportunities came up," Gan, 
who joined the carrier in January, told The Straits Times.
"I've had several good offers, but I'm still here because the board asked me to stay and help launch the airline," 
Gan was quoted as saying.  Rumours of Gan's impending departure first surfaced in early September before Tiger 
launched its inaugural flights to Thailand.  The launch of promotional, 1-Singapore-dollar flights to Bangkok, Phuket 
and Hat Yai overloaded the carrier's online booking system and caused a Web gridlock that shut down the 
reservation systems.  An avalanche of complaints poured in from customers.  Gan described the launch as "a huge 
success".  Tiger Airways is a partnership between Singapore Airlines, Temasek Holdings, the founders of Irish low-
cost airline Ryanair, and U.S.- based marketing and business strategy consultants Indigo Partners.  The carrier 
confirmed on Friday Gan will be leaving the company. It said a replacement CEO would be appointed shortly.  Gan 
said suggestions from industry watchers that he was asked to go by an unhappy board were not true.  "I've put 
together a very rigorous structure and a strong management team," he said. "Tiger Airways will be a success." 
Gan's impending exit comes when the airline and Valuair, the two budget carriers operating out of Singapore, are 
working to find their respective markets as another airline, Jetstar Asia, prepares for take-off in December. dpa ry gj

Two commercial airlines will begin direct service between Berlin and New York next year, ending the German 
capital's long-criticized lack of direct transatlantic flights, the U.S. airline Continental announced Monday.  
Continental will start flights from Berlin's Tegel airport on July 2 to Newark airport in New Jersey south of New York 
City.  The U.S. airline Delta announced last week it will begin direct flights on May 2 between Berlin-Tegel and New 
York's JFK airport.  Berlin has not had regularly scheduled direct flight to the United States since shortly after the 
September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S. when Lufthansa cancelled its direct service to Washington.  A Lufthansa 
spokesman, Thomas Jachnow, said the German airline had no plans to resume transatlantic flights from Berlin.  
"The figures don't make it worthwhile for us," said Jachnow adding there are not enough first class and business 
class passengers flying to and from Berlin.  Lufthansa operates most of its long-haul international flights from 
Frankfurt, Munich and also Duesseldorf.  Hotel operators and others in Berlin have long complained that the lack of 
a direct transatlantic flight hurts tourism and commerce in the city.  But wrangles over building a new Berlin airport 
have helped keep the German capital unattractive to major airlines.  Plans for a new mega-airport have been 
discussed for 15 years - but neither the financing nor final building approval has been agreed for the multi-billion 
euro project.  Meanwhile, the city's government is seeking to force the tiny downtown airport, Tempelhof, to close, 
despite offers by airlines to take over the operating costs.
Local residents don't like the noise of jets taking off and landing but business leaders strongly oppose the planned 
closure of Tempelhof which is mainly used by small aircraft on short flights within Europe.  Aside from Tegel in 
former West Berlin, the city's other airport is Schoenefeld, the former East German airport, southeast of the city 
which is popular with low-cost airlines such Easyjet and Ryanair. dpa lm ms

British budget airline Easyjet predicted its 2004 profits would be higher than expected on the basis of improved 
trading in the fourth quarter.  The airline, whose main hub is at Luton, north of London, said profits for the 12 
months to end-September would top 60 million pounds (105 million dollars), some 16 per cent up on the figure for 
2003.
In the face of stiff competition from rival Ryanair and the traditional flag carriers, the airline had warned in June that 
profits might just match last year's 52 million pounds.  Cost-cutting measures were taking effect, Easyjet said.  It 
plans to increase the number of aircraft in its fleet by about 16 per cent in 2005, down from the 24 per cent 
previously planned.  Chief executive Ray Webster said: "I'm pleased to report the actions we're taking to strengthen 
our competitive position have begun to pay off." EasyJet said load factors had remained in the high 80 per cents 
during the summer. dpa rpm ms

Head of no-frills carrier Ryanair Monday rejected criticism of its employment terms, and defended the airline's 
security record.  "Ryanair has been the subject of many false and untrue claims in recent weeks up here in 
Scandinavia," Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary told reporters.
The airline was targeted last week by members of the Swedish Salaried Employees' Union, HTF, who handed sick 
bags to passengers at four Swedish airports where the union had printed its demands that all low cost airlines 
should offer the same terms concerning minimum wages, overtime, insurance and pension rights.  The union 
criticised the Irish-based airline for not signing collective bargaining agreements with HTF, which other low cost 
rivals had.  O'Leary said he would not rule out such agreements in future "when a majority" of employees wanted 
that.  O'Leary also criticized recent reports in Stockholm daily Dagens Nyheter citing alleged incidents involving 
Ryanair planes. He said that security was important for the airline, and that it had "20 years unblemished record on 
security." The editor-in-chief of Dagens Nyheter, Jan Wifstrand, said that the paper would not retract the reports.  
Deputy head of HTF, Bengt Ohlsson, said the union would shortly present Ryanair a draft for a collective bargaining 
agreement.  HTF said it backed an international campaign coordinated by the International Transport Workers' 
Federation. The ITF has launched a website where Ryanair employees and others could get more information. dpa

Shares in Alitalia tumbled on the Milan stock exchange Tuesday, a day after its chief warned that the national

afternoon, having tumbled more than 6 per cent to an all-time low of 0.195 euros during morning trading.
Investors were reacting to a warning by Chief Executive Officer Giancarlo Cimoli, who on Monday said the company 
urgently needs to cut jobs or face liquidation. Executive Massimo Chieli, responsible for human resources, told the 
financial daily Il Sole-24 Ore that Alitalia had just 20 days to live unless a deal is struck.  The state-owned, loss-
making company needs to reach a cost-cutting deal with unions by September 15 in order to receive a 400 million 
euro emergency loan it has been promised by the government.  Alitalia said revenue over the busy summer season

British Airlines and rival Virgin Atlantic Monday announced they would more than double their fuel surcharges on 
long- haul flights, but short-haul carrier Ryanair said it had no plans to increase fares.  BA said it would hike the 
surcharge on long-haul flights to six pounds (11 dollars) from the current 2.50 pounds. The increase comes into 
effect with bookings made from Wednesday and means a 12 pound increase on a return ticket.  Virgin, which 
competes with BA o long-haul routes, followed suit, saying its fares would rise in similar fashion, also from 
Wednesday.  The airline said it had acted "reluctantly", adding the decision had been taken "in light of the recent 
increases in the price of oil - which reached a new high last week".  Ryanair, a major BA rival on short-haul flights 
within Europe, said it had no plans to introduce fuel surcharges.  Communications head Paul Fitzsimmons said: 
"Every Ryanair passenger can rest assured that Ryanair guarantees no fuel surcharges - not today, not tomorrow, 
not ever." BA simultaneously reported pre-tax profits of 115 million pounds in the second quarter, against a loss of 
45 million pounds in the same period last year. The results were better than expected and reflected a 5.1 per cent 
rise in revenues to 1.9 billion pounds.  "Fuel prices have risen by 45 per cent in the last 12 months and our fuel 
costs are expected to be 225 million pounds higher than last year," BA said.
BA is leaving its surcharge for short-haul passengers at 2.50 pounds a flight.  The airlines said it had set cash aside 
to meet the fuel costs and hedged almost three-quarters of its fuel bill to March next year.  "These are reasonable 
results but currently fuel and employee costs remain our biggest challenges," chief executive Rod Eddington said.  
BA chairman Martin Broughton said market conditions remained unchanged. "Long-haul premium volumes are 
recovering steadily, while short-haul premium travel remains at lower levels. The non-premium markets are very 
price sensitive," he said.  Cost-cutting remained core to BA's long-term strategy, he added.  More than 8,000 BA 
ground staff are currently being balloted over strike action that could take place this summer. dpa rpm emc sc

The cash-strapped joint Scandinavian carrier SAS has announced price hikes on several inter-Scandinavian routes 
in an effort to shore up earnings, reports said Monday.  The hikes of up to 400 kroner (54 euros/65 dollars) take 
effect as of August 3 on the some 600 flights that depart or arrive at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport.
The price hikes would affect flights operated by Scandinavian Airlines in Denmark, but not transatlantic flights or 
flights operated by SAS low-price company Snowflake.  "The current prices are not viable. We may lose some 
customers, but are willing to do that if we can increase earnings as long as it doesn't effect market shares," deputy 
head of SAS Denmark, Jens Wittrup Willumsen told the Danish news agency Ritzau.  SAS earlier this summer 
imposed a fee to compensate for fuel- hikes.  Creating a national SAS company in Norway, Denmark and Sweden 
respectively was one of the recent measures approved by management to bring the SAS Group back into profit.  
Recently, SAS Chief Executive Officer Jorgen Lindegaard said that the carrier would not be able to post a profit for 
the current year.  If SAS rivals do not hike their prices and SAS loses customers, the carrier would consider 
lowering prices again.  Danish rivals Maersk Air and Sterling said they have no plans to raise prices, while Michael 
O' Leary, head of Irish-based Ryanair recently forecast even lower prices. dpa lsm bg

In an increasingly competive low fare and package tourism sector in Germany, the airline Air Berlin and the travel 
concern TUI said Monday they would cooperate in serving holiday destinations. A report in the Hannoverschen 
Allgemeine newspaper said the cooperation would chiefly serve holiday travel to Egypt and the Canary Islands 
starting with the next winter season.
The cooperation is seen as a move to meet the competition posed by such cheap-fare carriers as Ryanair and 
Easyjet, the report said. Easyjet is currently considering making Hanover a base of operations in Germany. Air 
Berlin as well as TUI's carriers Hapag- Lloyd Flug (HLF) and Hapag Lloyd Express have threatened to pull out of 
Hanover airport if Easyjet is given permission. At Hanover-based TUI and at Air Berlin in the German capital, 
spokesmen confirmed the newspaper report about the aim for close cooperation. While HLF is foreseen giving 
priority to the Canary Islands and Egypt, Air Berlin would chiefly concentrate on the Balearic Islands, Spain and 
Portugal. Aviation industry analysts say that such an alliance would provide TUI with a competitive advantage in 
being able to offer customers more flights and to raise seating capacity utilisation. Already, HLF and Air Berlin have 
coordinated with each other in their operations at Nuremberg airport. The envisaged closer cooperation follows on 
TUI's failed plans to take over Air Berlin, now Germany's second-largest air carrier after Lufthansa. The TUI 
spokesman Monday ruled out buying into Air Berlin now. dpa ds jm

Budget airline AirAsia said Wednesday it will start offering daily flights from Macau to Bangkok for as little as 25 
U.S. dollars each way from mid-June.  The Malaysia-based airline will then offer daily flights to and from Kuala 
Lumpur by the end of the June for around the same price.
The cheap flights the first of their kind from Chinese soil are expected to prove a big lure for people from nearby 
Hong Kong, which is just an hour's ferry ride east of Macau.  AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandez said he was now 
negotiating for passengers from Hong Kong to be able to bypass customs in Macau to get straight onto flights out of 
the southern Chinese territory.  In an interview with Hong Kong radio station RTHK, Fernandez said he had spoken 
to Hong Kong airport officials about the possibility of direct flights but they had not seemed interested.  "I haven't 
seen a lot of interest from Hong Kong airport to be honest," he said. "Airports are still living in the world of 'you want 
to fly here, fly here'.  "There is certainly more of a monopolistic view that they don't need to go out there and get 
business and they dont have to adjust their model to adapt to new business models.  "We did have some 
discussions but they were very preliminary and at the end of the day, Macau Airport was hungry and aggressive 
and we would rather work with that kind of partner." AirAsia is the first no-frills budget airline of its kind in the Asia 
region and aims to emulate the runaway success of airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair in Europe. dpa hp mw

Singapore Airlines' chief executive in a published report Thursday is confident that Tiger Airways, his firm's low-cost 
arm, will hold up against mounting competition.  "Before we decided to embark on it, we did our own studies and 
projections," Chew Choon Seng said, "and we think the model for Tiger Airways is a sustainable one and a viable

A fourth low-cost carrier is the latest in eight months to announce its plans, backed by Australia's Qantas Airways 
and Temasek Holdings, the Singapore government's investment arm.  It follows Malaysian-run AirAsia, which has 
already started operations; Valuair, set up by former SIA staff; and Tiger, SIA's own venture with Temasek, Ryanair 
and U.S.-based consultants Indigo Partners.  The growing number is a "manifestation of how competitive the airline 
industry" has become, The Straits Times quoted Chew as saying. He said he did not know if the budget-carrier 
market was big enough for all the recent entrants.  "At least four independent parties think it is," Chew said. "It 
might be big enough for some, but not big enough for others." Tiger Airways, scheduled to take off by the last

Valuair's maiden flight will be to Bangkok when Singapore's first low-cost airline starts operating next month, a 
spokesman said on Thursday.  The carrier will also fly to Hong Kong and Jakarta, but after that, the public will 
decide the carrier's destinations.
Valuair has asked respondents to an online poll to pick from Perth, Phuket, Hanoi, Bangalore, Madras and Xiamen.  
"The cities we've listed are all points we're looking to fly to at some point in the short to medium term, and they are 
all within a five-hour radius from Singapore," The Straits Times quoted the spokesman as saying.  "We want to 
gauge demand on the ground before deciding on our destinations," he said.  Valuair, spearheaded by former 
Singapore Airlines (SIA) chief executive Lim Chin Beng, has been collecting feedback since January through the 
poll at a travel website.  The carrier, with a staff of 90, is waiting for an air operator's certificate from the Civil 
Aviation Authority of Singapore, necessary for it to operate commercial flights from Changi.  Unlike low-fare Tiger 
Airways, Valuair said its passengers will be provided services such as meals on board and allotted seats.  Tiger, 
which plans to take off in the second half of the year, was set up by SIA, state-owned investment agency Temasek 
Holdings, the founders of Irish airline Ryanair, and U.S. private investors.  The plan is for Tiger Airways to operate a 
fleet of single aisle aircraft on regional flights under four hours from Singapore.  Tiger and Malaysia's AirAsia are 
also waiting for air operator's certificates.  Budget travel is becoming increasingly popular in the Asia- Pacific region. 
Analysts expect low-cost carriers to control about 25 per cent of this market in 10 years. dpa ry pr

German airline Lufthansa, scrambling to recover from record losses, aims to charge a service fee on sales of its 
tickets in a move which some analysts said could backfire and drive customers even more to the low-fare airlines, 
reports said Monday.  In the latest issue of the weekly magazine Focus, airline officials said Lufthansa, starting on 
September 1, aims to add a charge of 30 euros (36 dollars) per ticket on flights in Europe and 45 euros on 
intercontinental flights.  The move would fall under Lufthansa's announced aim of listing ticket rates as a "net" price 
starting on that date.  The service charge would apply to ticket sales online, at Lufthansa counters and at the 
airline's telephone reservation centres. Those booking online would continue, as now is the case, to get a 10-euro 
rebate.  At the same time, Lufthansa aims to stop paying a commission to travel bureaux, leaving it up to them 
whether or not to pass the cost on to the customers. The savings on commissions would help the airline cut its 
costs by 100 million euros per year.  Lufthansa lost a record 984 million euros in 2003, with the airline feeling the 
pinch not only from a sluggish economy and passenger worries about terrorism, but also the competition posed by 
low-fare carriers.  Analysts were questioning the wisdom of Lufthansa's move to charge for a "service" which 
amounts to a normal procedure of selling a ticket, coming at a time when no-frills airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet 
are posing stiffer competition.
Some analysts point out that for the same cost as the service surcharge planned at Lufthansa, customers can make 
an online booking for a complete flight in Europe.  In a commentary in the daily Die Welt, the paper called 
Lufthansa's move an "own goal" and criticised Lufthansa for "not even making the effort to provide a credible 
explanation". The paper said that it would not come as a surprise if Lufthansa were forced to quickly rescind the 
service charge. dpa ds cu

Low-fare Tiger Airways has applied to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to operate commercial 
flights out of Changi Airport, company officials said on Tuesday.  Set up by Singapore Airlines (SIA), state-owned 
investment agency Temasek Holdings, the founders of Irish airline Ryanair, and U.S. private investors Indigo 
Partners, Tiger Airways is aiming to take off in the last quarter of 2004.
Charlie Clifton, the airline's adviser, said Tiger is awaiting CAAS acknowledgement that it has accepted the 
application for an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC).  "We started work on the AOC almost from the beginning," he 
told The Straits Times.  The plan is for Tiger Airways to operate a fleet of single aisle aircraft on four-hour (flying 
time) or less flights from Singapore.  Two other low-cost carriers also plan to be operating soon - Valuair, set up by 
SIA veteran Lim Chin Beng, and Malaysia's AirAsia.  "We have been studying the rise and successful growth of the 
low fare airlines in America and in Europe, and have been evaluating the applicability of the low-cost, no-frills model 
in our part of the world," SIA said earlier.  "Our conclusion is that it can succeed here as well," said officials from the 
the national carrier.  Budget travel is becoming increasingly popular in the Asia-Pacific region. Analysts expect low-
cost carriers to control about 25 per cent of this market in 10 years.  Despite its clobbering from the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) between April and June last year, SIA is aiming for a group profit of 600 million 
Singapore dollars (352 million U.S. dollars) by the end of March, the end of the fiscal year. dpa ry mw

Discount airline Ryanair has been ordered to repay millions of euros received in subsidies from Belgian authorities, 
following a European Commission ruling Tuesday.  Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary called the decision a "disaster" 
which interfered with the free market and could force Ryanair to hike its ticket prices.
Ryanair has to repay between three and four million euros, after the commission ruled that the airline was offered 
illegal incentives to use Charleroi airport, south of Brussels.  Ryanair received discounts on landing fees and other 
perks from local government. The commission said some of the discounts, estimated to be worth 15 million euros, 
were permissible as regional development support for the airport.  Others, however, offered exclusively to Ryanair, 
were illegal, and "incompatible with the proper functioning of the internal market", the commission said.  However, 
O'Leary insisted that the subsidies had been profitable for both Charleroi airport and Ryanair, and announced an 
immediate appeal to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  However the commission for its part insisted its 
decision would help to create a level-playing field for all airline operators.  "This legal decision is well balanced: it 
brings greater transparency into contractual relations between airlines and airports, especially regional airports," 
said Loyola De Palacio, E.U. transport commissioner.  De Palacio conceded that the ruling could affect Ryanair's 
ticket prices by "six or eight euros per ticket". dpa sr sc

Ryanair said Friday it would increase its ticket prices after a London court ruled in favour of a disabled man who 
sued the low-cost Irish carrier for charging him for a wheelchair.  Bob Ross, 55, who suffers from cerebral palsy 
claimed the 18 pound (32 dollar) fee he was charged at Stansted airport near London in 2002 was discriminatory.
The Central London County Court ruled in his favour and ordered Ryanair to pay 1,336 pounds, amounting to twice 
18 pounds for the outward and home journeys, 300 pounds for a wheelchair subsequently bought by Ross and 
1,000 pounds for injury to his feelings.  Disabled groups welcomed the ruling, but a Ryanair spokesman said it was 
"defective".  The company would in future charge every passenger 50 pence to meet the cost of providing 
wheelchair assistance at two British and two Irish airports where the airports do not provide it.  Ryanair would also 
appeal, he said.  Ross was dismissive. "I don't know why Ryanair are doing it. The point is they are making 
enormous profits and I feel they could absorb that charge without putting the price of their tickets up." The Disability 
Rights Commission, which backed Ross, said it demanded Ryanair pay compensation to 35 disabled people who 
have complained about paying the wheelchair charge during the past 12 months and threatened a group action.  
Ross, a regular flier, told the court he rarely used a wheelchair, preferring crutches or sticks instead, but that he 
found walking painful and the kilometre-long journey through the airport was too much for him.  Ryanair this week 
indicated it expected a drop in its profits for the current financial year, prompting a fall in its share price. dpa rpm sc

Dublin-based low-cost carrier Ryanair predicted Wednesday its profits for the financial year to end-March would fall, 
despite announcing an increase in profits for the third quarter.  The company, whose operations centre on Stansted 
Airport northeast of London, said cut-throat competition in the European market was likely to trigger a 10 per cent 
fall in net profits before exceptional items, to about 148 million pounds (265 million dollars) for the full year.
Profits after tax in the third quarter to December 31 had risen 10 per cent to a record 33 million pounds, with 
passenger numbers up by 54 per cent to 6.1 million, it said.  Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair was 
pleased with the results and that the airline continued to grow strongly and profitably. "Our response to these 
market conditions will be to continue to lower fares," he said.  Ryanair expects European Union regulators to rule 
next week that it received illegal discounts from Belgium to fly to Brussels Charleroi airport. dpa rpm pmc

Malaysia's budget airline AirAsia has defended itself against criticism by the government that its advertisements 
which offer cheap airfares are misleading, news reports said Sunday.
 AirAsia Chief Executive Officer Tony Fernandes said that other prominent budget carriers worldwide such as 
Europe's Ryanair and Virgin Blue in Australia used similar advertisements, the Sunday Star newspaper reported.
"Our advertisements are not cheating anyone," Fernandes was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
 Fernandes' comments came after Malaysian Tourism Minister Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir last week demanded a 
probe into AirAsia's newspaper advertisements, which he said were "misleading."
 The advertisements generally offer fares that are steeply discounted compared to Malaysia's flagship carrier, 
Malaysia Airlines. But Abdul Kadir said the airline was not being truthful because some of the fares only applied to 
30 per cent of seats available on each flight.
 Malaysia's Ministry of Domestic Affairs says it is investigating the matter and has suggested that AirAsia introduce 
more detailed advertisements to explain its fare structure.
 However, Fernandes said the current advertisements clearly stated that all fares were subject to availability and 
other conditions including booking and travel periods.
 AirAsia has been an immense success in Malaysia since its launch in December 2001. Last month, it began its first 
international flight - to Phuket, Thailand - and officials say AirAsia will expand to more destinations in Thailand and 
Indonesia later this year. dpa wy me

An appeals court in the northern French city of Nancy has rejected the request of Irish budget airline Ryanair to

 In its decision, the court upheld a July 24 court decision annulling an agreement between the Strasbourg Chamber

 Some 200 people took them up on the offer, and left disappointed after being handed an Internet address where

 Following the first judicial annulment of subsidies, Ryanair moved its regional base from Strasbourg to Baden

Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced on Tuesday it will set up a budget carrier called Tiger Airways with three other 
partners and begin flying next year.
 The partners are the government's investment arm, Temasek Holdings, U.S. private investors Indigo Partners and 
Ryanair founder Tony Ryan's Irlandia Investments, SIA's statement said.
 "The plan is for Tiger Airways to operate a fleet of single-aisle aircraft of one type, on flights up to under four hours 
from Singapore," the national carrier said.
"We have been studying the rise and successful growth of the low fare airlines in America and in Europe, and 
evaluating the applicability of the low cost, no frills model in our part of the world," SIA added.
 "Our conclusion is that it can succeed here as well," the statement added.
 Plans are to begin operations from Changi airport in the second half of 2004.
 SIA stressed it has no plans to shut down subsidiary SilkAir, although it would not rule out the possibility of Tiger 
Airways flying to some SilkAir destinations.
 Tiger Airways is Singapore's second budget airline to be announced after ValuAir, set up by Singapore Press 
Holdings chairman Lim Chin Beng.
 ValuAir earlier said it plans to take to the skies by the second quarter of next year.
 The capital structure for the new airline is being determined. "The SIA investment in it is likely to be immaterial 
relative to SIA's asset base", the statement said.
 ValuAir plans to fly a fleet of Airbus 320s.
 Budget travel is becoming increasingly popular in the Asia-Pacific region. Analysts expect low-cost carriers to 
control about 25 per cent of this market in 10 years.

Air Polonia is set to become the country's first budget airline to offer bargain no-frills flights between the Polish 
capital Warsaw and London, a company representative confirmed Thursday.
 The cheapest one-way fare will set travellers back 55.55 zloty (14 dollars) plus airport taxes which will raise the 
ticket price to 145.55 zloty (37 dollars).
A round-trip ticket could cost 78 dollars.
 Air Polonia will begin with three fights per week from December 15.
 Another up-and-coming Polish budget carrier, the Silesian Air- owned GetJet, also plans for connections from 
Poland to London, Paris and Rome.
 European Union-bound Poland was required to liberalize its rules governing air travel with E.U. countries in 
October. The new measures allow carriers to fly any route and to choose arrival and departure destinations.
 Analysts predicted the move would encourage less-than-enthusiastic budget airlines to consider opening up 
operations in Poland, the largest country poised to enter the E.U. next May. High airport user fees deterred their 
interest in the past.
 Budget carriers have already made inroads in other countries in the region, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Slovakia, Russia, Romania and Albania.
 However, Ireland's Ryanair lost interest in routes to southern Krakow in southern Poland after the airport authority 
refused to lower its user fees.
 Analysts predict Poland's flagship carrier LOT will be forced to reduce its fares. LOT recently became a member of

British low-cost carrier Easyjet saw its profits fall sharply for the fiscal year through September, largely as a result of 
the Iraq war, but forecast rapid growth in the year ahead.
 The company, whose main hub is at Luton north of London, declared pre-tax profits of 52 million pounds (86 million 
dollars), down 28 per cent on the year.
 Easyjet forecast growth of 20 per cent in the year ahead. The integration of 120 new Airbus aircraft was increasing 
frequency on its existing routes and allowing expansion to new hubs in Europe, it said.
The company showed costs of 7.9 million pounds from the integration of smaller rival Go, which it bought last year. 
It also had to write off 9.1 million pounds after passing up the option to buy Deutsche BA from British Airways.
 As a result of the Go transaction, revenues rose 69 per cent on the year to 932 million pounds and passengers 
were up 79 per cent to 20.3 million.
 Chief executive Ray Webster said the company's low cost business model had proved resilient despite the ongoing 
slump in civil aviation and he was "cautiously optimistic" about the performance in the current year.
 The focus for the year would be on integrating 120 planes bought from Airbus last year in a surprise switch from 
Boeing.
 EasyJet added 21 new routes in Europe during the year and announced earlier this month that it is planning to 
launch 11 routes from a new base at Berlin's Schoenefeld Airport.
 Referring to a dispute between the European Union and Ryanair over the subsidies the Dublin-based carrier 
receives for flying to Charleroi in Belgium, Webster said this would not affect Easyjet.
 "Our business model does not rely on the smaller publicly-owned airports that Ryanair has made its bases in 
continental Europe," he said. dpa rpm jm

Former Formula One motor racing star and airline owner Niki Lauda said on Sunday he will launch his latest

 Lauda, who recently took over the small airline "Aero Lloyd- Austria", said he would start with a single Airbus, 
which would have six charter flights weekly from Vienna to Egypt, the Canary Islands and Madeira carrying 
vacationers on behalf of a major tour company.
Lauda said in the newspaper Kleine Zeitung, published in Graz and Klagenfurt, he had not thought of a new name 
for his airline yet.
 In another interview, with the magazine Profil, he said: "As the first thing, I want to set up a cost structure which is 
30 per cent below the level of Ryanair and EasyJet." Initially he would lease staff as well as aircraft, he said.
 Lauda, aged 54, who has an airline captain's licence, said he wanted to fly again himself, and might possibly 
already do so on November 28.
 He did not know yet whether he would manage to have himself retrained in time from Boeings to Airbuses. "But if 
I'm in the cockpit, then it will, as formerly, be the best advertisement for my airline - also I am the best quality 
control."
 Lauda often piloted flights of his former airline Lauda Air, which he founded in 1979. In 2000 he was ousted in a 
power struggle with majority owners Austrian Airlines (AUA), which has since taken over the whole of Lauda Air.

Irish low fares airline Ryanair wants to expand it operations to Germany where the company is continuing to show 
strong growth, it said Thursday.
 Caroline Baldwin, the airline's Germany sales manager, said it was seeking to fly to three or four more German 
destinations in the medium term, with demand growing particularly in eastern Germany.
At present Ryanair flies to seven German destinations, and expects 2003/2004 business year results to show a 50-
per-cent increase in passenger numbers to 4.45 million to and from German airports.
 Ryanair claims that as a result of its German activities it had created about 4,000 jobs mainly through other 
companies providing airport services.
 On Wednesday it won the right to have Niederrhein airport recognized as a Dusseldorf airport in the international 
booking system despite opposition from German carrier Lufthansa and Dusseldorf International Airport.

as Dusseldorf's third airport after Dusseldorf and Moenchengladbach.

Efforts by cut-price airlines to seek improved access to the German capital have sparked further debate over 
Berlin's three airports and the possibility of opening a fourth at a former Nazi airbase outside the city, reports said 
Friday.
 Plans to build a mega-airport for Berlin by 2007 collapsed earlier this year after a decade of negotiations failed to 
yield a deal on private construction and operation of what is to be called Berlin - Brandenburg International.
 Officials insist the new airport will be built with state funds but few observers believe it is feasible, given that 
Berlin's local government is, in effect, bankrupt with 50 billion euros (55 billion dollars) of public debt.
Conservative opposition leaders predict the airport will not open until 2013 and accuse the city's leftist government 
of Social Democrats and post-communists of failing to present a serious financing concept.
 This means that, for years to come, Berlin will rely on its present three airports - the former West Berlin airport 
Tegel, which is used by most commercial operators, as well as the former East Berlin airport Schoenefeld and tiny 
Tempelhof airport just south of the city centre.
 The lengthy delay in building a new mega-airport has fuelled interest in alternatives.
 In a surprise move, the airline Deutsche BA - which British Airways sold to a German investor earlier this year - has 
offered to lease the entire Tempelhof airport for its 40 daily flights to and from Berlin.
 The Berlin Airport Holding which runs all three airports would be delighted to dump Tempelhof because it ran up 
losses of 13 million euros last year.
 Leasing Tempelhof to Deutsche BA (or dba as the airline now calls itself) may possible for a limited time, says the 
federal government which owns most of the airport.
 But, according to the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper, the government wants to sell the whole complex for 150 
million euros.
Wrangles over Berlin airports as cut-price airlines move in
 Tempelhof was to have been shut down in 2004 under the failed mega-airport privatization framework. The closure 
was partly to eliminate competition and partly because Tempelhof's flight paths cross densely populated areas.
 Cut-price Irish carrier Ryanair has also been making waves since it began flying between Berlin and London earlier 
this year.
 Ryanair wants to start operating from an airfield built in 1937 by the Nazis and later used by the communist East 
German government at Neuhardenburg, about 70 kilometres east of the city.
 Officials in the state of Brandenburg, where the airport is located, strongly back the plan.
 But Berlin's city transport senator, Peter Strieder, is furious and has vowed to torpedo the move.
 Berlin leaders fear that opening a fourth airport near the city would destroy the remaining chances of ever winning 
funds to build the planned major airport.
 Meanwhile, passengers flying to and from Berlin look set to suffer from limits on service for at least another 
decade.
 Berlin does not have a single direct flight to the United States forcing many international passengers to fly via

A Polish government minister has vowed to do all that he can to attract budget airlines such as Ryanair or EasyJet 
to the capital, Polish media reported Friday.
 "We'll do everything in our power to attract low fare airlines" to Warsaw, Poland's Deputy Minister for Infrastructure 
Andrzej Pilat said, the "Zycie Warszawy" daily quoted him as saying.
 Poland's southern tourist haven Krakow and a fledgling Katowice- based airline are honing plans for bargain flights 
to attractive European destinations. The Polish government jumped into the fray this week to try and retain 
Warsaw's primacy on the country's air travel market.
Pilat said his ministry had plans to set up a new joint company with Poland's state-run Przedsiebiorstwo Porty 
Lotnicze (PPL) airport monopoly, specifically to serve budget carriers. Responsible for most of Poland's commercial 
airports, PPL has so far reportedly refused to open negotiations with budget airlines.
 The capital currently commands 75 per cent of Poland's air traffic, with some 6 million passengers using Warsaw's 
Frederick Chopin International airport every year.
 Earlier this week, officials in Krakow pushed ahead with ambitious plans to build a second airport in the city, ready 
to serve budget carriers within a year's time.
 Based in the southern mining city of Katowice, fledgling Polish airline "Silesian Air - GetJet", is promising tempting 
roundtrip fares of 99 zloty (25 dollars) to Rome, Paris and London beginning this autumn. Low fare connections to 
Brussels, Milan, and destinations in Germany and Scandinavia are also on the cards, the carrier says.
 Airfields in both cities command only a fraction of air traffic in Poland, with Krakow landing 7.6 per cent while 
Katowice commands only 3 per cent at present.
 Other centres also lag far behind with the Baltic port city of Gdansk taking 5 per cent of air traffic, Wroclaw, in the 
southwest commanding 4 per cent of flights, Poznan in the west, taking 3.5 per cent of air traffic and Szczecin in the 
northwest commanding 1 per cent.

City officials from the southern Polish tourist haven of Krakow and the Polish Defence Ministry are teaming-up to 
create a new airport for the city intended to draw budget airlines into Poland, the country's top-selling Gazeta 
Wyborcza daily reported Wednesday.
 Budget European flyers like Ryanair and Easyjet have stayed away from future European Union member Poland, 
largely due to the high airport costs dictated by Poland's state-run Panstwowe Porty Lotnicze (PPL) airport 
conglomerate, the paper said.
The first step to breaking the PPL monopoly was taken this week by Poland's Ministry of Defence when it agreed to 
hand over a 10 hectare parcel of land near Krakow's current Balice airport to the city. The land will be used for the 
development of a new 20 million zloty airport, boasting user fees set to tempt budget flyers into Krakow.
 "Finally the last hurdle to bringing budget airlines here is disappearing," Krakow Mayor Jacek Majchrowski said, 
quoted by Gazeta. According to the mayor the project will be financed by both public and private capital and has 
already drawn private investors.
 Despite being keen on operating what promises to be a busy Krakow connection, Irish budget carrier Ryanair 
dropped plans to fly into the city when airport officials refused to even discuss preferential rates. PLL's 
intransigence on the issue raised the ire of Krakow's considerable hotel and tourist sector keen to boost trade.
 With a new airport now clearly visible on the horizon, Ryanair may use Krakow as its Eastern European base with 
connections to Stockholm and London at a fraction of the cost of existing carriers, Gazeta reports, quoting unofficial 
sources.

Soaring passenger numbers boosted budget airline Ryanair to a solid rise in profits for the second quarter, 
according to figures released in London Tuesday.
 Europe's largest no-frills airline declared a 12 per cent rise in profits on the year to 43.8 million euros for April to 
June. Turnover was up by more than a quarter to 245.2 million euros.
Outspoken chief executive Michael O'Leary poured scorn on his main rival, British Airways, following its 
announcement of a substantial loss for the period.
 "During what BA last week described as the most testing period in aviation history, we continue to drive down 
airfares, reduce costs, but at the same time deliver increased profits and exceptional margins," O'Leary said.
 Ryanair said passenger volume had grown 45 per cent to 5.1 million and 50 new routes had been launched.
 O'Leary said current trading was in line with expectations and profits were set to grow "materially" in the current 
financial year, although yields could not continue to match those achieved last year.
 The number of empty seats on Ryanair's flights has risen in recent months, with load factor at 78 per cent, down 
from 83 per cent a year ago. O'Leary attributed the decline to the new routes.
 Analysts noted that Ryanair's focus on Europe had protected it from the effects of the Iraq war and the SARS 
epidemic in Asia.
 Confirming the company's policy, O'Leary told the BBC he had no desire to fly longhaul and that the best market 
was in Europe.
 On Monday, the Dublin-based company, whose main hub is at Stansted north of London, published figures 
showing it had broken through the two million passenger mark in July alone - a first for any low cost airline outside 
the United States.

Business travellers are making a comeback to Asia now that the SARS outbreak is over, a Lufthansa executive said 
in a report on Saturday.
 The German carrier is seeing a double-digit rise in bookings to the region and near-full planes to Singapore, said 
Thierry Antinori at an industry dialogue here.
The daily nonstop flights between Frankfurt and Singapore are now more than 90 per cent full, Antinori told an 
industry dialogue on Friday.
 "The business is picking up," The Straits Times quoted him as saying. "In some markets, yields are improving 
again because there's a catch-up for business travel."
 Europe's third-largest carrier, whose flights to Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore were the worst hit 
during the height of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, had reduced scheduled flights on some Asian routes by 
up to 80 per cent.
 Top Lufthansa executives are visiting Asia, which makes up 15 per cent of its sales, as "an act of solidarity with the 
people and the industry here," said Juergen Weber, chairman of the carrier's supervisory board.
 China is the next stop.
 Weber said emerging budget carriers could carve out a new secondary low-end market.
 He maintained they will not be able to take on the big players as travellers will increasingly demand higher quality.

Flying is an uncomfortable business. Cooped up in a confined space means on longer trips for so long that the back 
hurts, the shoes no longer fit and the tongue feels it is made of rubber.
Some passengers vow never again. But then the discomfort is slowly forgotten and, when the next holiday comes 
around, they are ready to fly off again.
 The main cause of the discomfort is the seating in economy class. Cut-price airline Ryanair has seats with just 76.2 
centimetres from the front of one headrest to the back of the next. British Airways has a configuration for long-haul 
flights with 79 centimetres while Lufthansa, depending on aircraft, offers between 79 and 86 centimetres, JAL 81 to 
86 centimetres and Air France 81.3 to 86.4 centimetres.
 The seats at exits have more room, but a tip here is not to request the seat on the grounds that the feet are painful. 
Think of some other reason. People occupying these seats must be mobile in the event of an emergency. That is 
why these places are generally allocated only after arrival at the airport, a Lufthansa spokesman said.
 A psychologist has come up with the reason economy class travel is so wearying. Sascha Thomas offers, on 
behalf of Lufthansa, seminars for relaxed flying. He comes to the hardly surprising conclusion that too many people 
sit far too long together in a restricted space with too little to drink. With differences in temperatures between one 
place and another, and times, passengers "are simply physically finished" when the arrive wherever they are going.
 The alternatives are to fly first or business class or not to fly at all. dpa ut ct

Ryanair announced a sharp rise in profits for the year to end-March, but warned Tuesday that expansion of its 
routes and the strong euro would hit profits in the current year.
 The Irish-run low-cost carrier, whose main hub is at Stansted north of London, declared an after-tax profit of 239.4 
million euros, almost 60 per cent up on the 150.4 million euros made last year.
Pre-tax profits rose by more than 50 per cent to 266 million euros.
 Passenger traffic grew by 42 per cent to 15.7 million and the airline's planes were 84 per cent full compared with a 
figure of 81 per cent in the previous period.
 Measured by passengers carried, the airline now claims to be the third-largest in the world.
 "These results demonstrate how robust Ryanair's lowest fares business model is in Europe," Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said.
 He cited high fuel prices, the Iraq war, the impact of SARS and the continuing global downturn as negative factors.
 "Despite these difficult conditions Ryanair's continued profitability stems from the fact that we have the lowest costs 
and the lowest air fares, which no other European airline can match," O'Leary said.
 Ryanair planned to carry more than 30 million international scheduled passengers a year within the next three 
years, he said, adding that, even with lower fares, it expected to record a 16th successive year of profits for the 
current year. dpa rpm jm

million euros, up 59 per cent on the 150.4 million euros made last year.
 Pre-tax profits rose by more than 50 per cent to 266 million euros.
The company's share fell 27.5 pence to trade at 412 pence in London shortly before midday.
 Passenger traffic grew by 42 per cent to 15.7 million and the airline's planes were 84 per cent full compared with 
81 per cent in the previous period, although occupancy could drop to 80 per cent in the current year, the company 
said.
 "These results demonstrate how robust Ryanair's lowest fares business model is in Europe," Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said, but he warned the current margin of 28 per cent could not be sustained.
 "Shareholders should be aware that these results for the past 12 months have been exceptional. We have 
repeatedly stated that profit margins of almost 30 per cent are a one-off and non-sustainable," he said.
 The business plan aimed at increasing traffic by an average by 25 per cent a year and maintaining after-tax profits 
at around 20 per cent, O'Leary said.
 Regarding problems facing the sector, O'Leary pointed to high fuel prices, the Iraq war, the impact of SARS and 
the continuing global downturn as negative factors.
 "Despite these difficult conditions Ryanair's continued profitability stems from the fact that we have the lowest costs 
and the lowest air fares, which no other European airline can match," O'Leary said.
ROUNDUP: Ryanair posts profits rise, warns strong euro will hurt
 Ryanair planned to carry more than 30 million international scheduled passengers a year within the next three 
years, he said, adding that, even with lower fares, it expected to record a 16th successive year of profits for the 
current year.
 Ryanair, flying 125 routes this summer after buying Buzz, expects to overtake British Airways and Lufthansa as 
Europe's largest internationally scheduled airline within three years.
 It has firms orders on 125 and options on 125 aircraft, all from Boeing, and is predicting that passenger numbers 
will rise to 24 million in 2003-4 from 15.7 million in 2002-3.
 O'Leary pledged to continue his assault on the traditional airline sector with aggressive fare-cutting.
 "Our aim is not to kill anyone, but it is to grow aggressively. We're going to destroy the airline business as we know 
it," he told the Reuters news agency.
 "In two years' time we will be the world's largest international scheduled airline."
 In Germany, one of its important markets, the company announced it planned to establish two new hubs in addition 
to Hahn near Frankfurt. It is also talking to airports in eastern European countries. dpa rpm jm

The joint Scandinavian airlines SAS announced plans on Thursday to cut a further 4,000 jobs as part of a new 
round of savings to keep the financially-strapped carrier aloft.
 SAS, controlled by the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish states, said it needed to cut costs by up to 8 billion kronor 
(944 million dollars) over and above the 12.8 billion kronor in savings already slated through 2005.
SAS since September 2001 already has let go some 3,500 employees, and the new reductions over the next 18 
months will hit both pilots, administrative, sales, cabin and ground personnel, the company said during a meeting 
with representatives from 38 unions involved in the three ownership countries.
 The salaries of some 2,000 pilots will be frozen with the flying time being increased from 10.5 hours to 12-14 hours 
per day depending on the number of flights.
 The pilots have accepted a deal that means basically they have to fly more for considerably less money, but it 
remains to be seen whether the other personnel groups' unions will accept the separate offers made to them.
 SAS CEO Joergen Lindegaard said the new savings plan is necessary in order to boost the airline's 
competitiveness and for its future expansion.
 "We know that competition on Scandinavian air routes will get tougher and therefore we have to be well prepared 
for the future," said Lindegaard.
 Lindegaard said that SAS must be able to offer more and cheaper air travel in the Scandinavian market.
 SAS has been under growing pressure on its own turf from such budget airlines as Ryanair and Easyjet. dpa fp sc

Police in the city of Aarhus, western Denmark, have accused the Irish low-fare airline Ryanair of violating Danish 
marketing laws, the national newspaper Jyllands-Posten said Friday.
 Ryanair's practice of advertising its budget rate ticket without adding local taxes and fees, so that the prices seem 
lower than they really are, is illegal, according to the police.
The case against Ryanair was reported to the police by the Danish National Consumer Agency following complaints 
by rival airlines, the newspaper said.
 Ryanair also has been criticised for collecting an airport tax of 66 kroner (9.50 dollars) per passenger, and then 
pocketing 33 kroner on each ticket, because the airline actually pays only 33 kroner to Aarhus airport thanks to a 
rebate arrangement.
 The agency claims Ryanair's marketing practices mislead the consumers. Until recently, Ryanair advertised ticket 
prices on its Internet sales site that did not include the airport taxes and fees. dpa fp sc

Irish-owned low-cost carrier Ryanair said Wednesday it was cutting 12 routes and 400 jobs from Buzz, KLM's 
budget airline which Ryanair takes over on April 1.
 Ryanair said it would ground all Buzz flights for the month of April, A final decision would follow soon "on whether 
to restart flying on May 1, or close Buzz altogether", it said.
There was immediate protest from trade unions in Britain, from were Buzz operates most of its flights.
 Ryanair announced at the end of January it was buying Buzz from the Dutch company for 15 million pounds (24 
million dollars) and chief executive Michael O'Leary predicted he could turn it around from its current loss-making 
position within a year.
 O'Leary pointed to Buzz's fleet of BAE aircraft and its use of major hubs as the main causes of the losses. Ryanair 
operates exclusively Boeing 737s and uses minor airports. It will retain two BAE 146 aircraft.
 Ryanair said Wednesday that Buzz was currently losing more than one million euros (690,000 pounds) a week.
 While 12 Buzz routes were cut, another 12 would see increased flight frequencies and reduced fares, it said.
 Among the flights cut are those from London Stansted to Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam, Marseilles, Toulon, 
Tours, Bergerac, Caen, Dijon, Geneva, Chambery, Brest and Almeira.
 Ryanair said Buzz was "heavily overstaffed" carrying fewer than 3,000 passengers per employee compared to 
Ryanair's figure of almost 10,000.
 Ground staff trade unionist Paul Kenny said there was "absolute outrage" at the announcement. Pilots union Balpa 
responded it was "angered" and that it was taking legal advice.
 The Transport and General Workers Union said it was seeking an urgent meeting with Ryanair, adding that the 
plans fell short of legal requirements on consultation. dpa rpm jm

British Airways announced Monday it had shown a profit in its third quarter to the end of December but warned that 
this year would be more difficult than last.
 Presenting interim results, the group said pre-tax profits for the quarter came in at 25 million pounds (40 million 
dollar), against losses of 160 million for the same quarter in 2001.
Turnover edged up one per cent to 1.86 billion pounds.
 BA warned it expected the business environment in 2003 to be "tougher" than last year and is still not anticipating 
any growth in revenues.
 "Forecasting revenue against the backdrop of the threat of war, increasing competitive pressure and an uncertain 
economic outlook is difficult, but at this stage we anticipate no revenue growth over the next 12 months," it said.
 BA, like other major carriers, was badly hit by the September 11 attacks in 2001. It has also come under pressure 
in its domestic and European markets from low-cost carriers Ryanair and Easyjet.
 In May 2002 it reported its worst set of results since privatisation 15 years ago, with full-year losses of 200 million 
pounds.
 The subsequent restructuring programme has seen more than 9,200 staff cut since August 2001. A further 10,000 
cuts are projected by the end of March this year and 13,000 by March 2004. dpa rpm ds

Low-cost Irish airline Ryanair announced Friday it was buying rival Buzz, owned by Dutch national carrier KLM, and 
that it was ordering 22 new Boeing 737 aircraft as well as taking options on a further 78.
 The company said it was paying 15 million pounds (25 million dollars) for Buzz and six billion dollars for the 100 
aircraft.
 Buzz operates 21 routes from London's Stansted airport - Ryanair's hub in the Britain - to points in Germany, 
Holland, France and Spain, as well as two French domestic routes.
Ryanair said it planned to close a number of Buzz's high-cost, unprofitable routes. The remaining routes would be 
operated at an increased frequency, with lower fares and costs. It aims to return Buzz's six BAe-146 planes to KLM.
 The order for new Boeings will enable Ryanair to carry more than 50 million passengers a year and generate 
employment for 3,000 people, including 800 pilots, 2,000 cabin crew and 200 engineering and operational staff, 
according to the airline.
 It follows an order placed a year ago for 150 Boeing 737s and means the group will have a total fleet of 250 Boeing 
737-800s in eight years.
 The purchase of Buzz, which will go through on April 1, subject to regulatory approval, marks further consolidation 
in Britain's booming low-cost airline industry. Last year Easyjet bought Go, originally set up by British Airways, for 
374 million pounds.
 Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said the acquisition of Buzz was "opportunistic", as the airline was seen 
as a bargain. The deal runs counter to Ryanair's past policy of growing organically.
 "The cost of the Buzz acquisition is nominal at a net cash cost of under five million euros, which will be a bargain if 
we can - as we expect - turn it around in one year," O'Leary said.
 He predicted Buzz's two structural cost problems of an inappropriately expensive fleet and expensive congested 
airports would be resolved within 12 months. dpa rpm sc

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair announced Wednesday it is adding five new European destinations to its flights from 
Stansted airport north of London.
 From the end of April, the no-frills airline will add Reims and Pau in France, Maastricht in Holland, Haugesund in 
Norway and Duesseldorf in Germany, which will be served from Niederrhein airport.
One-way fares to Maastricht and Duesseldorf will start at 49.99 pounds (82 dollars), while the one-way fares on the 
other three new routes will start at 59.99 pounds.
 From April 30, the airline will serve 49 European destinations from Stansted, where it started operations in 1989.
 On Tuesday, Ryanair said it had chosen Stockholm's Skavsta airport as its ninth European base and from April 4, 
would operate more than 30 flights a day from Stockholm to Glasgow, Hamburg, Paris, Oslo, Aarhus in Denmark 
and Tampere in Finland in addition to the services it already operates from Sweden to London and Frankfurt. dpa

The low fares carrier Ryanair announced on Tuesday that it will open a new European base at Stockholm's Skavsta 
airport, challenging SAS on its own turf in Scandinavia.
 Ryanair, the leading European budget airline, said it planned to operate up to four aircraft from Skavsta with more 
than 30 flights daily to Aarhus, west Denmark, Glasgow, Paris, Torp near Oslo and Tampere in Finland.
The new services, using Boeing 737-800 aircraft, are set to open on 4 April.
 "Thanks to Ryanair, and Stockholm Skavsta Airport, the SAS high fares monopoly in the Scandinavian market is at 
an end," said Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary in Stockholm.
 O'Leary said Ryanair would break the Scandinavian "monopoly" of SAS - jointly owned by the Swedish, Norwegian 
and Danish states - by offering consumers savings between 84 and 95 per cent savings compared to SAS fares.
 Destinations included in the budget Ryanair flights are London- Stansted, Frankfurt, Aarhus, Oslo, Tampere, 
Glasgow, Hamburg and Paris.
 Single tickets on the Skavsta-Aarhus route will sell for 399 Swedish krona (47 dollars) with Ryanair compared with 
2,671 krona with SAS.
 Ryanair's move in the Scandinavian market is bound to make it even more difficult for the financially strapped SAS 
to compete in the region.
 "We will break SAS' monopoly on the Danish market, finally giving Danes a chance to fly low fare to Stockholm. A 
privilege that SAS has denied its passengers for too long," said Ryanair's communications chief John Rowley, 
speaking to reporters at Aarhus airport. dpa fp mga jm

British low-cost carrier Easyjet Thursday sealed a deal, first announced in October, to buy 120 new Airbus A319 
aircraft over the next five years.
Easyjet, based at Luton north of London, will take two of the aircraft every month until completion.
 To date, Easyjet has used Boeing 737s, and there was intense speculation at the time of the deal that substantial 
discounts had been agreed in order to secure the switch.
 Easyjet's main competitor, the Irish Ryanair, ordered 100 Boeing 737s in January last year and took an option on a 
further 50. Unconfirmed reports at the time also referred to substantial discounts. dpa rpm ms
