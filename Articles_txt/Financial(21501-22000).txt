INTERNATIONAL Airlines Group, formed by the merger of BA and Iberia, has posted a 2.1 per cent rise in 
passenger traffic in November, boosted by 4.6 per cent growth in premium traffic.
Traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, rose by 2.1 per cent versus November 2010, while passenger 
load factor - a measure of how well it fills its planes - was down 0.3 percentage points at 75.3 per cent.
IAG said its first and business-class travel - the most profitable part of its passenger business - rose 4.6 per cent, 
while non-premium traffic was up 1.6 per cent.
Industry body IATA last week said international passenger traffic growth had slowed in recent months and that it 
expects to suffer from waning consumer confidence, sluggish international trade and high fuel prices in 2012.
IAG, which recently agreed to buy Lufthansa's British unit bmi, last month reported a 31 per cent fall in third-quarter 
profit, better than expected and outperforming peers. However, its traffic growth has slowed in recent months.
International Airlines Group said last week its transatlantic joint venture with American Airlines would continue to 
operate as normal after the US carrier filed for bankruptcy protection.
"We have every confidence in the future of American Airlines. We are pleased they are taking this step which 
shows commitment and determination," IAG said in a statement. Budget rival Ryanair fared less well last month, 
seeing its passenger numbers fall eight per cent to 4.68m in November after it grounded up to 80 aircraft due to 
higher oil prices.
Shares in IAG beat the market to rise 2.9 per cent yesterday, while Ryanair rose 1.6 per cent.

The main Dublin shares index rose sharply on growing hopes of a sweeping solution to the euro zone debt crisis as 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met ahead of a key summit.
The ISEQ rose 43.29 points to 2,763.88.
The leaders of Germany and France met under intense pressure to agree a plan for imposing budget discipline 
across the euro zone, as markets rallied in the hope they can produce find a sweeping solution to the debt crisis at 
last. European stocks rose to a five-week closing high, after French president Nicolas Sarkozy and German 
chancellor Angela Merkel agreed on a range of measures to help resolve the euro zone debt crisis. Banks rose 
sharply, with the STOXX Europe 600 Banking Index up 2.7 percent, though it is down nearly 30 percent in 2011 
with many banks having suffered heavy writedowns on exposure to euro zone sovereign debt. The FTSEurofirst

Business lobby groups, while welcoming efforts to cut the deficit were highly critical of today's spending cuts phase 
of the Budget, saying it was a "missed opportunity" to boost enterprise and jobs. ISME, the Irish Small and Medium 
Enterprises Association, said it was "livid" at the decision to reduce the employers' redundancy rebate from 60pc to 
15pc, in effect increasing the costs of redundancy for employers by 112.5pc. Ryanair issued passenger statistics for 
November. Davy expected an unusual but well-flagged event: a drop in passenger traffic. The airline said 
passenger number fell 8pc on an annual basis. "The reduction in capacity should of course have a positive yield 
effect; we currently assume yields up 14.8pc in the airline's third quarter (Q3)," the broker said. Its shares jumped

According to the newswires, Semapa has signed an agreement to acquire a 50pc stake in Supremo Cimentos SA in 
Brazil. The business operates in the southern sate of Santa Catarina and operates an integrated clinker and cement 
factory, in addition to concrete and aggregates operations. The Brazilian firm is also undertaking an expansion plan

The main Dublin shares index rose sharply this morning on growing hopes of a sweeping solution to the euro zone 
debt crisis as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meet ahead of a key 
summit.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 38.62 points to 2,759.21.
The leaders of Germany and France met under intense pressure to agree a plan for imposing budget discipline 
across the euro zone, as markets rallied in the hope they can produce find a sweeping solution to the debt crisis at 
last. Markets want French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to forge a 
comprehensive proposal in Paris for restoring faith in euro zone nations' ability to repay their debts, before a 
European Union summit later this week. But despite their single nickname of "Merkozy", the Franco-German duo 
has yet to produce a single master plan for halting a slide which is threatening the currency union's survival.
At home, following a series of coordinated announcements in recent weeks, including a televised address by the 
Taoiseach last night, the two Budget announcements over the next two days are simply filling in some of the gaps 
regarding the budget consolidation to take place in 2012, Goodbody Stockbrokers said. Today sees 
announcements on spending measures, where E2.2bn of expenditure reductions will be identified, while a further 
E1bn in new taxation measures will be announced tomorrow afternoon (E1.6bn taxation measures in total including 
a E600m carryover from Budget 2011). Ryanair will issue passenger statistics for November later today. Davy 
expect an unusual but well-flagged event: a drop in passenger traffic. This could be around 10pc as the full effect of 
grounding 80 aircraft comes into effect. "We see loads of about 80pc. The reduction in capacity should of course 
have a positive yield effect; we currently assume yields up 14.8pc in the airline's Q3," the broker said. Ahead of its 
investor day today (December 5th), APN - in which Independent News and Media is a major investor, has released

The no-frills airline reported 4.68 million passengers flew on its aircraft in the month compared to 5.06 million in

Jump-start for new promo drive by Tourism Ireland

Tourism Ireland's marketing plan for 2012 includes the launch of a new global advertising campaign, Jump Into 
Ireland, to reach up to 60 million people in 22 markets worldwide.
The blueprint for 2012 is part of a broader three-year plan to build on a return to growth, eventually aiming to 
achieve nine million visitors to Ireland in 2015.
"I wouldn't put it up if I didn't think it was achievable," said Niall Gibbons, chief executive of Tourism Ireland. "Yes, 
we have the euro crisis, low consumer confidence, all of that.
"But at a time when tourism is struggling to grow globally, we really need to look at achieving growth of 6 per cent 
per annum with a view to breaking our 2007 record in 2015. We can sit around and talk about all the caveats, but 
it's time for us to put our shoulders to the wheel."
The visitor figure to Ireland for 2011 marked a 7 per cent increase on 2010. Gibbons said that, although the budget 
hadn't yet been finalised, he was confident that Tourism Ireland would have a good spend for 2012, somewhere in 
the region of EUR 50 million.
"Something that helped us in 2011 was the redirection of a portion of air travel tax money to our campaigns. We're 
currently working on a joint campaign with the industry," he said.
The cooperative advertising promotes affordable air fares into Ireland. As part of the campaign, and for the first 
time, Ryanair will upload a video to its website, featuring Ireland as a destination.
The new tagline, Jump Into Ireland, is a "positive and assertive call to action", said Gibbons. "This is the fourth 
edition of the Ireland brand, and the latest since 2008. The strapline at that time, Go Where Ireland Takes You, was 
suitable for a brand positioning that revolved around fun and spontaneity."
Gibbons said that the tourism landscape had undergone radical change.
Jump-start for new promo drive by Tourism Ireland
"Now people are bamboozled by choice and they're taking fewer holidays and fewer breaks. We're seeking to 
revitalise and reposition the brand in 2012," he said.
"There's no point in standing back and wondering whether people will take holidays or not -- we've got to be more 
immersive, get under people's skin a little bit more."
Tourism Ireland's websites, in 42 countries and 14 languages, will also be revamped throughout next year.
Research carried out by Tourism Ireland revealed that the majority of overseas consumers wanted to feel 
replenished and uplifted on returning home from a holiday or trip.
Gibbons said Tourism Ireland was drawing on a number of powerful themes and locations to impart the ability of 
Ireland to do that as a destination.
"With Jump Into Ireland, we're focusing on our literary heritage and on our music," said Gibbons.
"We're putting an emphasis on locations such as the Cliffs of Moher, the Rock of Cashel and Connemara. We're 
going about all this with what I like to call a contagious informality -- we want our marketing to leave people with a 
smile on their faces."

The Office of Fair Trading has launched an investigation into Groupon after the online deal website broke UK 
advertising regulations 48 times in the past year.
Groupon, which provides discounts on anything from wedding receptions to family meals, was referred to the 
regulatory body by the Advertising Standards Authority. It is the first time the advertising watchdog has taken such a 
move against a big advertiser since its conflict with Ryanair in 2008 .
The three-year-old website broke the advertising code, according to the ASA, by exaggerating potential savings 
from its deals, making offers that were not actually available and failing to make clear important terms and 
conditions.
The most recent of the infringements came when Groupon offered £5,000 worth of "breast augmentation" surgery 
for £1,999 if the offer was taken up within the day. The ASA said this was encouraging consumers to rush into 
plastic surgery.
The advertising watchdog made 11 formal rulings of code breaches against Groupon and announced a further 37 
informal breaches.
"Given Groupon's track record, we have serious concerns about its ability to adhere to the advertising code," said 
the ASA.
"It is in the public interest that we refer the matter to the OFT, the OFT being better placed to address any 
underlying issues concerning Groupon's trading practices generally."
The announcement by the ASA prompted the OFT to reveal that it was already concerned about Groupon and had 
been conducting a secret investigation into the company since July.
Groupon made headlines last month after raising $700m in its initial public offering, which valued the company at 
$12.6bn. Following a bullish first day , the stock has slumped 23.6 per cent to $19.96, slightly below its IPO price.
OFT launches Groupon advertising investigation MEDIA
In the past, client companies have complained about the business model that allows Groupon as much as half of 
the sale price of the already heavily discounted service or product.
Last month, a Berkshire cake maker said it had almost gone bust after it offered a 75 per cent cupcake discount 
and was overwhelmed when thousands more people than expected redeemed the vouchers.
The OFT said the investigation was likely to take at least six months, and possibly much longer if the case goes to a 
criminal court.
Groupon said that it "constantly strives for business practices that are in the best interest of consumers", adding: 
"We are constantly evolving business process to ensure customers receive the best possible experience at the 
highest standards.
"We are co-operating fully with the OFT to ensure that the rights of consumers are protected."

Body
Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) and China Aircraft Leasing Company (CALC) signed a 
provisional agreement for 20 C919 jets in Hong Kong yesterday. The value of the deal was not disclosed. Comac 
has not yet given the C919 a list price.
CALC is the fifth lessor to the commit to the C919. The Hong Kong-based leasing company is targeting a fleet of 
100 aircraft by 2015.
In June, Chinese state-owned investment company, China Everbright, purchased a 40% stake in the lessor. CALC 
says it expects to be the first Chinese aircraft leasing company to list on the main board of the Hong Kong stock 
exchange next year.
Comac has 215 C919 commitments from 10 customers: Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, 
Hainan Airlines Group, CDB Leasing, Gecas, ICBC Leasing, Sichuan Airlines, BoComm Leasing and CALC.
Ryanair is also considering a Comac order, according to an October report by the Financial Times.
The Irish low-cost carrier's CEO, Michael O&Leary, met with Comac executives in China on November 30. 
According to Comac, the two sides discussed "ideas on issues of common interest including the C919 program and 
cost control in order to advance the growth of both companies".
The C919 is scheduled to complete its debut flight by 2014 and to begin delivering to customers by 2016, Comac 
says.

Picture this: You are about to board a flight from London to Ibiza that you booked for less than (EURO)40. Because 
the flight was so cheap, you had to find a way to make the 30-mile trip to Gatwick Airport at 4 a.m., instead of being 
able to leave from the much more accessible Heathrow Airport.
Once you board the plane, you realize there's something off. While it might be hard to pinpoint with all that yelling 
from the people who couldn't wait to land in the Canary Islands to get drunk, as soon as you sit down, you know. 
The seats on the plane are set much more closer than usual, almost like they jammed 10 percent more people 
inside the cabin than there should be.
Jokingly referring that fact to an air stewardess, you mention they "don't make Boeings like they used to any more", 
when, without pausing from closing the airlock, she corrects you: "Boeing? This isn't a Boeing. This is a COMAC, 
made in China."
While the above might sound like a terrible, terrible nightmare to many travelers -- COMAC is new to the market 
and has not met Western standards of airworthiness -- it is also the dream of Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.
In an interview with the Dow Jones Newswires, the chief executive at the Irish low-cost airline said he had just 
returned from touring the Shanghai factory where the Commercial Airline Corporation of China, a government 
entity, is building a 199-seat competitor to the single-aisle Boeing A320.
In the interview, O'Leary told the newswire "you could not fail to be impressed by the resources they are putting 
into" development of the aircraft, which will likely be less costly than the alternatives currently offered by aerospace 
giants Boeing and Airbus, and be set up to carry 25 more passengers within a fuselage of the same size.
COMAC is still a long way from being able to mass market its planes, and it has not met Western safety standards it 
would need to pass in order to sell to major airlines.
Yet Ryanair is a wildly successful airline, one of the very first low-cost model operators that calls itself the "largest 
airline in Europe by traffic." The executive endorsement is unlikely to fall on deaf ears.

The ISEQ put in one of the best day's trading in months gaining close to 5pc amid hopes that coordinated moves by 
the world's central banks, assertive action from EU leaders on the debt crisis and a boost to China's economy will 
revive investment prospects.
The index rose 125.33 points to 2,749.05.
European shares rallied in tandem with other risk assets after leading central banks announced joint action to inject 
liquidity into financial markets strained by the euro zone's debt crisis. Banks and other cyclical stocks were among 
the top gainers, with the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index and Basic Resources index both up more than 4 percent 
by the close.
Driving the move was a coordinated move by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central 
banks of Canada, Britain, Japan and Switzerland to lower the cost of existing dollar swap lines to prevent a liquidity 
squeeze. Kerry Group's shares surged 131c to E27.75, Elan rose 44c to E8.15 and Ryanair climbed 17c to E3.80. 
Shares in Irish-Swiss bakery products group, Aryzta, jumped 125c to E34.91. Ralcorp Holdings boosted operating 
profit in its US frozen bakery products division in Q4 by 10pc and posted a 100bps rise in margin to 11pc in the 
period. For its full year ended September, operating profit rose by 9pc but margin stepped back 100bps to 11pc. 
Divisional sales in Q4 and for the full year rose by 7pc and 10pc respectively. Volume fell 1pc in Q4 but rose by 4pc 
for the full year. Sales growth was primarily due to price increases. Volume rose in food service but declined in in-
store (frozen dough and bread). Shares in building materials giant, CRH, rose 82c to E14.25. Beacon Roofing, 
which distributes roofing products in the US (similar to CRH's Allied Distribution Business), reported Q4 results 
ahead of forecast. Revenues in Q4 were dollar 576m, up 19pc year-on-year (15.6pc on a like-for-like basis) and 
ahead of the dollar 552m forecast. Residential demand was up 25.7pc, while non-residential sales were 10.8pc 
higher. EPS at 56c was ahead of the 54c consensus number. Management reported double-digit growth in most of 
its regions with volumes benefiting from storm damage and prices from "industry-wide price increases". "CRH has

already reported the Q3 performance of its Americas Distribution business in its interim management statement 
with like-for-like sales growth of 12pc. Profits in the quarter were ahead of last year, and the company expects full-
year EBITDA (core earnings) from this division to be circa 5pc ahead of last year," said Davy analyst, Barry Dixon. 
Sportingbet's Q1 results announcement to the end of November contains some interesting potential read-through 
for its larger peers. There are three things that stand out to us in Sportingbet's statement. These are: The continued 
strong growth of its Australian business; the increasingly challenging environment in Europe from a combination of 
economic and regulatory pressures and the boost that the growth in mobile is providing to the business. Shares in 
Paddy Power climbed 108c to E40.35.

Body
The ISEQ put in one of the best day's trading in months gaining close to 5pc amid hopes that coordinated moves by 
the world's central banks, assertive action from EU leaders on the debt crisis and a boost to China's economy will 
revive investment prospects.
The index rose 125.33 points to 2,749.05.
European shares rallied in tandem with other risk assets after leading central banks announced joint action to inject 
liquidity into financial markets strained by the euro zone's debt crisis. Banks and other cyclical stocks were among 
the top gainers, with the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index and Basic Resources index both up more than 4 percent 
by the close.
Driving the move was a coordinated move by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central 
banks of Canada, Britain, Japan and Switzerland to lower the cost of existing dollar swap lines to prevent a liquidity 
squeeze. Kerry Group's shares surged 131c to E27.75, Elan rose 44c to E8.15 and Ryanair climbed 17c to E3.80. 
Shares in Irish-Swiss bakery products group, Aryzta, jumped 125c to E34.91. Ralcorp Holdings boosted operating 
profit in its US frozen bakery products division in Q4 by 10pc and posted a 100bps rise in margin to 11pc in the 
period. For its full year ended September, operating profit rose by 9pc but margin stepped back 100bps to 11pc. 
Divisional sales in Q4 and for the full year rose by 7pc and 10pc respectively. Volume fell 1pc in Q4 but rose by 4pc 
for the full year. Sales growth was primarily due to price increases. Volume rose in food service but declined in in-
store (frozen dough and bread). Shares in building materials giant, CRH, rose 82c to E14.25. Beacon Roofing, 
which distributes roofing products in the US (similar to CRH's Allied Distribution Business), reported Q4 results 
ahead of forecast. Revenues in Q4 were dollar 576m, up 19pc year-on-year (15.6pc on a like-for-like basis) and 
ahead of the dollar 552m forecast. Residential demand was up 25.7pc, while non-residential sales were 10.8pc 
higher. EPS at 56c was ahead of the 54c consensus number. Management reported double-digit growth in most of 
its regions with volumes benefiting from storm damage and prices from "industry-wide price increases". "CRH has 
ISEQ surges 5pc on crisis end hopes; ISEQ Up
already reported the Q3 performance of its Americas Distribution business in its interim management statement 
with like-for-like sales growth of 12pc. Profits in the quarter were ahead of last year, and the company expects full-
year EBITDA (core earnings) from this division to be circa 5pc ahead of last year," said Davy analyst, Barry Dixon. 
Sportingbet's Q1 results announcement to the end of November contains some interesting potential read-through 
for its larger peers. There are three things that stand out to us in Sportingbet's statement. These are: The continued 
strong growth of its Australian business; the increasingly challenging environment in Europe from a combination of 
economic and regulatory pressures and the boost that the growth in mobile is providing to the business. Shares in 
Paddy Power climbed 108c to E40.35.

Body
The chief executives of EasyJet, International Airlines Group, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic launched a stinging attack 
on the government after it confirmed an 8 per cent rise in air passenger duty would take effect in April.
The duty is a passenger-based tax that varies according to the length of flight and class of ticket. Next April, it rises 
from £12 to £13 for economy fares to European cities.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, parent of British Airways, said: "The tax hike in air passenger duty will crush 
the tourism sector that is already reeling from the highest levels of taxation in the world."

Shares in Dublin have leapt by nearly two per cent this morning as a wave of optimism sweeps Europe on hopes of 
action to deal with the debt crisis.
The ISEQ index is up 45.07 points at 2,567.04.
The gains add to a tentative rise in prices seen on Friday.
Reports from Brussels, Paris and Berlin suggest that efforts to find a quick deal to stem the crisis are reaching a 
feverish level. A suggestion that Italy is about to get a 600bn euro IMF loan has been denied, but a separate report 
says that Germany is planning an AAA bond with the five other top rated euro zone members to fight the crisis. In 
Dublin, most big name shares have shown gains this morning. CRH is ahead by 30c to 1262, 2ith Kerry Group 
adding 26c to 2565. Grafton has advanced by 7c to 236 and Ryanair by 2c to 357. Sqiss-Irish bakery group Aryzta

Highlight: A British court has suspended a competition probe into Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus to allow 
an appeal against the investigation.
Body
A British court has suspended a competition probe into Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus to allow an appeal 
against the investigation, Ryanair said this morning.
The Office of Fair Trading in Britain last year launched a probe into whether Ryanair's near 29.8 pc holding in Aer 
Lingus gave it the power to influence the former state carrier's commercial policy and hampered competition.
Ryanair challenged the OFT move, saying it no longer had jurisdiction over the deal, which was closed in 2006.
The Court of Appeal yesterday ordered a stay of the OFT probe until after a full hearing on the case scheduled for 
mid-2012, Ryanair said in a statement. Court officials were not immediately available for comment. Ryanair 
mounted a public takeover for all of Aer Lingus in October 2006, but the European Commission investigated the bid 
and decided to prohibit it in June 2007. In a separate development, Aer Lingus has dismissed as "without 
foundation" allegations by Ryanair that the formerly state-owned airline's directors have been acting in breach of 
company law and stock-exchange listing rules. Ryanair has been seeking to force Aer Lingus to call an 
extraordinary general meeting, so that it can put two resolutions to shareholders: that Aer Lingus give a formal 
undertaking that no further funds will be put into a hugely debilitated pension fund scheme and that it will also 
release a confidential report prepared for its board into a controversial 2008 'leave and return' scheme. Aer Lingus 
has rejected calls by Ryanair to convene an EGM.

The ISEQ index of shares fell through the 2,500 floor in early trade but closed higher after talk that private sector 
bondholders may be off the hook in the next phase of the debt bailout.
The ISEQ rose 9.31 points to 2,521.97.
European stocks pared losses after news that euro zone member states, mindful of flagging market confidence in 
euro zone debt, are considering dropping private sector involvement in the region's permanent bailout fund due to 
come into force in 2013, four EU officials said. The discussions are taking place as part of wider negotiations over 
changing the EU treaty to introduce stricter fiscal rules, which Germany insists on as a precondition for deeper 
integration among euro zone states. U.S. stocks rose after six days of losses, but the market was still headed for its 
worst week in two months on fear that Europe's debt crisis lacked a unified response.
UK baked goods (bread, cakes and morning goods) manufacturer, Finsbury Foods, reported to its AGM (November 
24th) that higher input costs had eroded margin in the first four months trading of the current year. It describes the 
UK operating environment as particularly challenging with shopper behaviour continuing to be affected by the 
economic uncertainty. Shares in Aryzta fell 5c to E33.20 and Glanbia was up 20c at E4.65. Still in the UK, the 
Government there started the consultation phase on the Green Deal, which is expected to launch next October. The 
scheme will allow households to install packages of energy saving technologies such as insulation at no upfront 
cost with payment made over time out of the energy savings. It is estimated that this will kick-start £14bn of private 
sector investment over ten years. Energy companies will be required to provide support and ensure that everyone 
has access to the scheme. As a sign of the UK's commitment to the Green Deal, the Government yesterday 
announced £200m of new funding to "provide a special time-limited introductory offer to boost the take up of the 
scheme". This will allow early adopters of the scheme to save more. According to the Housing Survey, there is 
£27bn (£1,400 per household) of cost effective energy efficiency measures that need to be done to the housing

stock. "The Green Deal will go a long way to addressing this deficit and companies like Kingspan and SIG are well 
placed to take advantage of it," said Goodbody's analyst, Robert Eason. Kingspan's shares were down 10c at 
E6.00. Press reports in Germany indicate that Air Berlin (AB) is considering selling a substantial stake in the airline 
to investors. Goodbody Stockbrokers said that Ryanair was targeting Germany, so may be unhappy if AB gets an 
investor. "However, it may also have implications for Aer Lingus, which had been linked to Etihad in mid-October 
arising from its approach to the Irish government on its 25pc stake in the Irish airline. Obviously, use of the AB 
network in core Europe may ultimately prove a larger attraction for Etihad than an airline based in Ireland (AB flies 
long haul to the US as well as Aer Lingus)." Shares in Aer Lingus failed to get off the ground at E0.66 while Ryanair 
climbed 5c to E3.55.

The ISEQ index of shares fell through the 2,500 floor this morning for the first time in 9 weeks as investors 
expressed exasperation that there is still no comprehensive solution to the eurozone debt problem.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 14.36 points to 2,498.30.
European stocks fell and the euro hit a seven-week low as record borrowing costs for Italy stoked fears the lack of a 
comprehensive policy response to the spiralling euro zone debt crisis would lead to a break-up of the currency bloc. 
Italy paid a euro-era high 6.5 percent to borrow over six months, almost double the yield at a similar sale a month 
ago and much higher than market yields ahead of the auction. It raised the full E10 billion planned but borrowing 
costs for Europe's third-largest economy remain unsustainably high despite the appointment of an emergency 
government in Rome to undertake reforms and rein its massive debt.

The ISEQ index of shares fell through the 2,500 floor this morning for the first time in 9 weeks as investors 
expressed exasperation that there is still no comprehensive solution to the eurozone debt problem.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 14.36 points to 2,498.30.
European stocks fell and the euro hit a seven-week low as record borrowing costs for Italy stoked fears the lack of a 
comprehensive policy response to the spiralling euro zone debt crisis would lead to a break-up of the currency bloc. 
Italy paid a euro-era high 6.5 percent to borrow over six months, almost double the yield at a similar sale a month 
ago and much higher than market yields ahead of the auction. It raised the full E10 billion planned but borrowing 
costs for Europe's third-largest economy remain unsustainably high despite the appointment of an emergency 
government in Rome to undertake reforms and rein its massive debt.
UK baked goods (bread, cakes and morning goods) manufacturer, Finsbury Foods, reported to its AGM (November 
24th) that higher input costs had eroded margin in the first four months trading of the current year. It describes the 
UK operating environment as particularly challenging with shopper behaviour continuing to be affected by the 
economic uncertainty. Shares in Aryzta fell 75c to E32.50 and Glanbia was flat at E4.45. Still in the UK, the 
Government there started the consultation phase on the Green Deal, which is expected to launch next October. The 
scheme will allow households to install packages of energy saving technologies such as insulation at no upfront 
cost with payment made over time out of the energy savings. It is estimated that this will kick-start £14bn of private 
sector investment over ten years. Energy companies will be required to provide support and ensure that everyone 
has access to the scheme. As a sign of the UK's commitment to the Green Deal, the Government yesterday 
announced £200m of new funding to "provide a special time-limited introductory offer to boost the take up of the 
scheme". This will allow early adopters of the scheme to save more. According to the Housing Survey, there is 
£27bn (£1,400 per household) of cost effective energy efficiency measures that need to be done to the housing

stock. "The Green Deal will go a long way to addressing this deficit and companies like Kingspan and SIG are well 
placed to take advantage of it," said Goodbody's analyst, Robert Eason. Kingspan's shares were flat at E6.10. 
Press reports in Germany indicate that Air Berlin (AB) is considering selling a substantial stake in the airline to 
investors. Goodbody Stockbrokers said that Ryanair was targeting Germany, so may be unhappy if AB gets an 
investor. "However, it may also have implications for Aer Lingus, which had been linked to Etihad in mid-October 
arising from its approach to the Irish government on its 25pc stake in the Irish airline. Obviously, use of the AB 
network in core Europe may ultimately prove a larger attraction for Etihad than an airline based in Ireland (AB flies 
long haul to the US as well as Aer Lingus)." Shares in Aer Lingus failed to get off the ground at E0.66 while Ryanair 
climbed 6c to E3.56.

(RTTNews) - The UK market is in negative territory in afternoon trading Friday, as eurozone debt worries continue 
to weigh on markets globally. Investors see no immediate end to the crisis, as more discouraging reports pour in. 
The Asian markets fell and the U.S. index futures are lower.
The Financial Times reported that the European Financial Stability Facility may not be able to increase its capacity 
from the current 440 billion euros to over 1 trillion euros due to worsening of market conditions over the past month. 
Markets fell yesterday after Chancellor Angela Merkel said euro bonds were "not needed and not appropriate."
Meanwhile, Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, has said that the modest 
improvement in Germany's business confidence, as revealed by the latest Ifo survey, does not signal an end to 
market worries, especially in the wake of Wednesday's unsuccessful bond auction and persisting weakness in the 
economy.
Loynes said in a note that the outlook component of the Ifo index, which rose marginally following the sharp 
declines over the past six months, points to stagnation in the German economy in the coming quarters.
Shortly after Fitch Ratings downgraded the sovereign ratings of Portugal by one notch to 'BB+' from 'BBB-', Moody's 
Investors Service on Thursday downgraded Hungary's government bond rating by one notch to 'Ba1', below 
investment grade. It also maintained a negative outlook, citing heightened uncertainty regarding the ability of the 
nation to meet its medium-term fiscal targets.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is losing 0.81 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is falling 0.36 percent.
The FTSE 100 index has been trading below the flat line and is currently losing 0.56 percent.
Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Antofagasta, Kazakhmys and Xstrata are losing between 1 percent and 3.2 
percent. Vedanta is declining 5.4 percent.
HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered are falling between 1 percent 
and 2 percent.
Premier Foods is climbing about 7 percent after the company appointed Mark Moran as Executive Director and 
Chief Financial Officer effective early December.
UK Market Loses Moderately
Severn Trent is dropping 3.2 percent. The water utility reported a fall in profit for the first half of the year.
Cosalt is plunging 33 percent after the struggling marine safety products supplier agreed to be acquired by its 
Chairman David Ross for 0.1 pence per share in cash, representing a discount of 71.43 percent to its closing price 
of 0.35 pence per share on Thursday.
Budget airline Ryanair is down over 1 percent. The UK Court of Appeal has ordered a stay of the UK Office of Fair 
Trading's investigation into the company's 29 percent minority stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus Group Plc, until a full 
hearing of the investigation scheduled for mid-2012.
Blacks Leisure Group is plunging 17 percent. The company said it currently sees outcome for the full year to be 
below expectations.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX is falling 0.61 percent and the French CAC 40 is dropping 0.70 percent. 
Switzerland's SMI is losing 0.27 percent.
In economic news, German import price inflation for October slowed slightly, the Federal Statistical Office said. 
Import prices rose 6.8 percent year-on-year in October, following September's 6.9 percent. Economists were 
expecting the annual rate to remain at 6.9 percent.
Consumer confidence in France deteriorated more than economists expected in November, data released by 
statistical office Insee showed. The consumer confidence index dropped to 79 in November from 82 in October. 
Economists expected a reading of 81 for November.
Across Asia/Pacific, markets ended in negative territory. Australia's All Ordinaries lost 1.40 percent, China's 
Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.72 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng retreated 1.37 percent. Japan's 
Nikkei 225 edged down 0.06 percent.
In the U.S., futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. The markets were closed on Thursday for the 
Thanksgiving Day.
In the commodity space, crude for January delivery is sliding $0.46 to $95.71 per barrel and December gold is 
sliding $17.6 to $1678.3 a troy ounce.

(RTTNews) - European markets ended a brutal week by paring some recent losses on Friday, as bargain hunters 
picked over badly beaten-down stocks.
Still, the major averages were down sharply for the week, stung by growing concerns that officials can no longer 
contain the region's sovereign debt crisis.
After a characteristically rotten start to Friday's session, shares rallied around mid-day and held gains in the final 
hours of trading.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks unofficially rose 0.91 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 
index, which includes some major U.K. companies, added 1.03 percent.
Despite the daily gain, the Euro Stoxx 50 was down more than 5 percent for the week.
Unofficially around Europe, the German DAX rose 1.19 percent and the French CAC 40 edged up 1.23 percent. 
The UK's FTSE 100 gained 0.63 percent and Switzerland's SMI added 0.72 percent.
Financial stocks rebounded on rumors that the private sector will be spared in a plan to backstop distressed 
sovereign debt.
The capacity to expand its European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund to more than EUR 1 trillion from 
EUR 440 billion is doubtful, given the sharp deterioration in market conditions, the Financial Times reported, citing 
three unnamed senior euro-area officials.
The Italian 2-year yield briefly topped 8 percent overnight, and Germany's dismal auction earlier in the week has 
raised fears that the contagion in spreading to the region's most powerful economy.
French lenders were in focus after Barclays cut its price targets on Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas and Societe 
Generale. Despite the recommendations, shares of all three companies were up more than one percent.
In Germany, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank added more than 2 percent. Barclays cut its price target on both 
stocks
ThyssenKrupp was up fractionally. Societe Generale cut the stock to "Hold" from "Buy" and reduced its price target.

News & support services firm WireCard rose 0.8 percent. Commerzbank raised its price target on the stock.
Insurer Axa gained 3 percent. The shares were reportedly upgraded to "Buy" from "Neutral" at Goldman Sachs. 
JPMorgan reduced its price target on the stock.
Premier Foods added 4.7 percent after the company appointed Mark Moran as Executive Director and Chief

of 0.35 pence per share on Thursday.

Trading's investigation into the company's 29 percent minority stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus Group Plc, until a full 
hearing of the investigation scheduled for mid-2012.
Blacks Leisure Group lost 14.3 percent. The company said it currently sees outcome for the full year to be below 
expectations.
UniCredit rose 1 percent. Barclays and Nomura cut their ratings on UniCredit.
French retailer Carrefour rose about one percent after denying that its CEO is on the way out.
In economic news, German import prices rose at a slightly slower pace of 6.8 percent year-on-year in October, the 
Federal Statistical Office said Friday.
The annual increase follows September's 6.9 percent rate. Economists were expecting the annual rate to remain at 
6.9 percent.

the UK OFT's investigation into Ryanair's 29% minority stake in Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL.L), which was first

company added that at present, the OFT's investigation will be suspended until the Court of Appeal rules on this 
"out of time" issue, following a full hearing of the case, which is scheduled for the middle of 2012.

Irish airline Ryanair said yesterday it will pursue Aer Lingus directors for a breach of company law if the former state 
carrier refuses again to hold an extraordinary general meeting. Ryanair, Aer Lingus''s largest shareholder with a 
near 30 per cent stake, said it had the right to request a meeting at which it wanted to discuss Aer Lingus''s 
(EURO)400m (£344.2m) pension deficit and a tax settlement. Aer Lingus, which said last week that Ryanair was 
using its shareholding simply to harass a competitor, once again rejected the call.

The ISEQ closed flat after making modest early headway and after five days of falls with investors boosted by a 
surprise pick-up in German business sentiment but disappointed with Merkel's stance on the ECB.
The index ended 0.89 points up at 2,512.66.
German business sentiment rose in November for the first time in nearly half a year, suggesting Europe's largest 
economy is weathering the euro zone debt crisis and turmoil in international markets better than some had feared.
European shares fell for the sixth consecutive session in low volume after German Chancellor Angela Merkel 
renewed her position against changing the role of the European Central Bank to ease the euro zone debt crisis. 
Kingspan's Danish peer, Rockwool announced Q3 results on November 23rd. Guidance for the year was left 
unchanged (constant currency revenues up 15pc, profit after tax of DKK 550m). No comment was made on 2012. 
Q3 revenues rose 20pc year-on-year (yoy) with insulation revenues up 22pc yoy. Kingspan shares ended 15c up at 
610. Lee and Man, the second-largest containerboard producer in China, has reported a 22pc decline in profits in 
the six months to end-September. Sales were up 6pc. FOEX data suggests that OCC prices have declined by a 
further E5/tonne over the past week. Shares in Smurfit Kappa dipped 1c to E4.10. Dixons has reported half-year 
results for the six month period to October 15th, 2011. In its H1 results, Dixons reports that it has outperformed the 
market. This is hardly surprising as its competition was in disarray. In recent weeks, Kesa has sold its UK Comet 
stores while Best-Buy has announced the closure of its 11 UK 'Big Box' stores after only entering the UK market a 
year ago. In the UK and Ireland, Dixons like-for-like sales, on a constant currency basis, were down 8pc year-on-
year in H1. Shares in DCC fell 18c to E17.07. Shares in Ryanair climbed 3c to E3.54 despite warnings of sustained 
high prices for crude oil in to next year.

Ryanair has said it will pursue Aer Lingus directors for a breach of company law if the former state carrier refuses 
again to hold an extraordinary general meeting.
Ryanair, Aer Lingus's largest shareholder with a near 30 pc stake, said this morning it had the right to request a 
meeting at which it wanted to discuss Aer Lingus's 400m euro pension deficit and a tax settlement.
Aer Lingus, which has consistently rejected the call for an EGM, said last week the requisition to hold a meeting 
was not properly made, and Ryanair was using its shareholding simply to harass a competitor.
Ryanair, a thorn in its fellow carrier's side for years with constant criticism of its management and performance, said 
Aer Lingus did not have discretion in the matter. "Please be advised that should your board again refuse to convene 
this properly requisitioned EGM, then Ryanair will pursue the directors of Aer Lingus for this breach of Irish 
company law and the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange," Ryanair said in a Nov. 18 letter addressed to Aer 
Lingus and released this morning. While the government is considering selling its 25 pc stake in Aer Lingus as part 
of a wider sale of state assets under an EU-IMF bailout, the airline's pension deficit, larger than its 380m euro 
market value, is a major stumbling block. Ryanair, which has said it would consider selling its Aer Lingus stake to 
whoever buys the government's holding, wants the airline's board to confirm it has no obligation to make any 
additional payment to its pension scheme. Aer Lingus said in August it had no obligation to fund the pension deficit, 
adding its position could be open to legal challenge.

Ryanair, a thorn in its fellow carrier's side for years with constant criticism of its management and performance, said 
Aer Lingus did not have discretion in the matter. "Please be advised that should your board again refuse to convene 
this properly requisitioned EGM, then Ryanair will pursue the directors of Aer Lingus for this breach of Irish 
company law and the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange," Ryanair said in a Nov. 18 letter addressed to Aer 
Lingus and released this morning. While the government is considering selling its 25 pc stake in Aer Lingus as part 
of a wider sale of state assets under an EU-IMF bailout, the airline's pension deficit, larger than its 380m euro 
market value, is a major stumbling block. Ryanair, which has said it would consider selling its Aer Lingus stake to 
whoever buys the government's holding, wants the airline's board to confirm it has no obligation to make any 
additional payment to its pension scheme. Aer Lingus said in August it had no obligation to fund the pension deficit, 
adding its position could be open to legal challenge.

Airports set to be fined for poor service

Body
Regulators are to get new powers to fine airports for poor performance, in a move that could help reduce the 
chances of a repeat of last winter's snow debacle at Heathrow.
In the biggest shake-up of the Civil Aviation Authority's role in regulating airports for 25 years, ministers on 
Wednesday published draft legislation that would put an end to conflicting priorities at the watchdog by stating its 
primary duty is to promote passengers' interests.
The legislation would enable the CAA to subject large airports to a new licensing regime, which could include 
conditions aimed at ensuring they coped with severe weather. Breaches of licence conditions could result in fines of 
up to 10 per cent of airports' turnover. The CAA said such arrangements could help guard against a repetition of 
last December's snow problems , when thousands of passengers were stranded after Heathrow airport experienced 
almost four days of disruption.
"The draft bill would allow the CAA to impose resilience conditions as part of airport licences," said the CAA. 
"Sanctions for breaching these conditions could include financial penalties."
The CAA's economic regulation role is rooted in legislation that dates from 1986, shortly before BAA, Heathrow's 
owner, was privatised. The case for reform came to a head in 2009 when the Competition Commission called for 
the break-up of BAA because of its dominance, and criticised the system of economic regulation.
The draft civil aviation bill would give the CAA more clout, and the ability to intervene quickly, by providing it with 
civil enforcement powers for the first time. Currently, the watchdog must often choose between issuing informal 
warnings to airports for alleged offences, and pursuing criminal cases against them.
The legislation would enable the CAA to move away from price caps on the charges that Heathrow, Gatwick and 
Stansted levy on airlines for using their facilities, instead imposing performance conditions on them. Gatwick, which 
is owned by a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners, is considering the case for arguing it should be 
exempted from the licensing regime because it does not wield significant market power.
Airports set to be fined for poor service
British Airways welcomed the licensing regime, "backed by proper enforcement powers and regulatory 
accountability". EasyJet also welcomed the proposal, but Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair and a critic of 
both the CAA and BAA, dismissed it as a "complete waste of time".

Body
(RTTNews) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Thursday said the Board of Aer Lingus does not 
have discretion in requisitioning an EGM. Since Ryanair owns more than 10% of the ordinary share capital, it is 
legally entitled under S.132 of the Companies Act 1963 and the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange, to 
requisition an EGM.
Ryanair Holdings added that the Board of Aer Lingus is obliged to convene a properly requisitioned EGM and the 
Board of Aer Lingus and its lawyers are free to make whatever representations on each of the proposed 
resolutions.
Ryanair Holdings also stated that it will pursue the Directors of Aer Lingus for this breach of Irish Company Law and 
the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange if it again refuses to convene this properly requisitioned EGM.

Passengers across Ryanair's network will be able to reserve seats for a £10 surcharge starting next year, 
underscoring the move by UK-listed budget airlines away from low-cost carriers' traditional open-seating model.
Ryanair began a reserved seating trial this April , allowing customers to book spots in the first two rows or exit rows 
on flights from Dublin and Gatwick airports to Malaga in Spain, and extended the offering to select other routes over 
the year.
The decision to roll out reserved seating - which "has proven to be very popular with Ryanair customers", according 
to the company - to all of its 1,400-plus daily flights follows news that Luton-based rival EasyJet would begin trialling 
designated seating on some flights next spring.

Making an exhibition
Given that Brits are renowned for their inability to master tongues beyond English (and some aren't so good at that - 
ed), it ill behooves us to mock others' attempts at the language of Shakespeare. But we did enjoy the press release 
informing us aircraft interiors company Iacobucci would be exposing at the upcoming Dubai air show. Luckily it's 
warm there this time of year.
Qatar solo
Nice bit of guerrilla - although no doubt expensive - marketing from Qatar Airways that disproves the view 
everything in Dubai is run for the family business's benefit.
Anyone approaching last week's Dubai expo by car ran the gauntlet of dozens of banners from the "World's number 
one airline" welcoming visitors to the air show. The expo is next door to Dubai International's terminal 3, ever-
expanding hub of rival Emirates.
Interestingly, the region's other big player and Emirates' nearest neighbour - Etihad - scarcely had a presence at the 
show at all. Down the road in Abu Dhabi, the big event of the week was not some minor air show but the Grand 
Prix.
The rivalry between the two international gatherings extended to the post-event parties. Star of the show at Dubai's 
gala evening was Tom Jones. Abu Dhabi arguably went one better with Paul McCartney.
Spot of hover
Hey, Fred start her up and see if I can hold on. Funnier captions for the picture on the right- taken on set-up day at 
the Dubai air show - appreciated.
Flight into future
No Headline In Original
Jörg Hillebrand has a great spot - and an intriguing enquiry, which sadly no one on the current Budgie staff can 
shed much light on.
"I recently discovered," he says, "an edition of Flight International appears in Star Trek: Search for Spock. It can be 
seen on a table in the spacedock lounge and seems to feature the launch of a rocket."
Jörg has even supplied a screenshot. "I searched your archives, trying to find the exact issue of Flight seen in the 
film, but have not been successful," he continues. "Filming for Star Trek III began in August 1983 and ended in 
October 1983, so the cover must be from a magazine before October 1983."
Reassuring to discover they're still reading Flight International in the late 22nd century.

World domination: flight of the Irish executives
World domination: flight of the Irish executives
Sunday Business Post

Section: MARKETS
Length: 1251 words
Body
The announcement that Dublin Airport Authority chief executive **Declan Collier**is to become chief executive of 
London City Airport highlights the success which Irish people have enjoyed in the upper echelons of global aviation.
The world of Irish aviation is small and close-knit and has a clear family tree. **Geoffrey O'Byrne-White**, former 
chief executive of Cityjet, which is owned by Air France, said the small market in Ireland forced ambitious Irish 
aviation executives to look abroad.
The advent in 1975 of global aircraft leasing giant GPA in Shannon from one-time Aer Lingus employee **Tony 
Ryan**opened up horizons for many, according to the former Irish Air Corps pilot. Protégés of GPA, Aer Lingus and 
the airline which Ryan later founded, Ryanair, predominate in Ireland's aviation diaspora.
Declan Collier is not the only DAA/Aer Rianta executive to seek opportunities overseas. Former Shannon Duty-Free 
boss **Colm McLoughlin**was part of an Aer Rianta team invited to Dubai in 1983 to start Dubai Duty-Free. Galway 
native McLoughlin has ever since run a duty-free shop like no other. In 2010 it had sales of $1.27 billion, it employs 
4,000 staff and is the largest single airport retailer in the world in terms of turnover. Its subsidiaries include hotels, 
an Irish village and a tennis stadium.
**Aer Lingus connections**
If **Michael O'Leary**'s success is as the great outsider of the aviation world, former Aer Lingus pilot **Willie 
Walsh**is the outsider who reached the heart of its establishment.
As chief executive of British Airways he drove the $7.1 billion deal that saw it merge with Spain's Iberia to create 
International Consolidated Airlines, which the Dublin man now heads. He has regularly butted heads with Britain's 
powerful trade unions, but received plaudits for how he handled Heathrow's Terminal 5 fiasco. In 2004, then 
taoiseach Bertie Ahern criticised Walsh, then chief executive of Aer Lingus, and his management team for putting 
forward an investment proposal for Aer Lingus, a move widely interpreted as the prelude to a management buyout.
World domination: flight of the Irish executives
In his current role, Walsh is on the short shortlist of potential buyers of the government's stake in Aer Lingus. 
Walsh's chief operating officer, **Seamus Kearney**, spent a brief spell at Jim Mansfield's Citywest before finding 
sweeter pastures as managing director of Jacobs Fruitfield.
**Dermot Mannion**was president of support services with Emirates when he was named as Walsh's successor at 
Aer Lingus. He has gone back to his Middle Eastern aviation roots and now heads Royal Brunei Airlines, where he 
is overseeing a fleet expansion. His time in Aer Lingus was stormy. He steered Aer Lingus through its 2006 IPO 
and fended off a hostile takeover bid from Ryanair.
**Alan Joyce**, a cousin of Willie Walsh, is another former Aer Lingus executive plying his trade in the southern 
hemisphere. He has on occasion been touted as a candidate for the top job at Aer Lingus. He is chief executive of 
Australian flag carrier Qantas, which is going through a particularly stormy period. Joyce hit the news in recent 
weeks with his decision to lock out striking workers and ground the entire Qantas fleet. "Cutting off the nose to spite 
your face is no way to run a business," said one Australian commentator.
**The Ryanair web**
In some ways Tony Ryan can be seen as patriarch of Ireland's aviation family tree, having started in Aer Lingus, set 
up GPA and then Ryanair. At GPA he hired a host of young enthusiastic executives who never looked back when 
GPA imploded. Graduates of his businesses include Denis O'Brien and Michael O'Leary.
Michael O'Leary no doubt tops the list as Ireland's most successful aviation executive without even leaving Dublin 
Airport to do it. Other graduates of the Tony Ryan stable have travelled much further afield.
Ryan's son, **Declan**, was a founding shareholder of Ryanair, a former chief executive and a director of the 
company until 2004. But in aviation circles he is probably best known for leading his family's 16 per cent investment 
in Singapore based low-cost carrier Tiger Airways in 2003. It aped Ryanair and shook up local flag carriers, often 
provoking strong reaction.
"Tiger and what they have done have come across as a joke, and will probably continue that way," Alan Joyce told 
the Sydney Morning Herald in 2007 as it eyed up the Australian market.
But last year Ryan sold most of his family's stake in Tiger, netting a reported $30 million. He has gone on to take a 
10 per cent stake in a Bangkok-based joint venture between Thai Airways and Tiger called Thai Tiger Airways.
**Charlie Clifton, former Ryanair operations director, its fifth employee an**d the person who sold its very first ticket, 
was also involved in setting up Tiger Airways. He then became vice-chairman of Skybus, a low-cost start-up based 
in Ohio. It ceased operations in 2008. Earlier this year it was reported that Clifton was an adviser and director at 
Brazilian low-cost carrier Webjet.
**Conor McCarthy**, head of the aircraft maintenance company Dublin Aerospace, started his career in Aer Lingus, 
where he spent 18 years and rose to be chief executive of its commuter operation. He went on to become Ryanair's 
chief operations officer and is a shareholder and director with vivaAerobus of Mexico, a partnership between the 
Ryans and a Mexican bus company, and Malaysian-based Air Asia, where he is a director and co-founder.
**Aircraft leasing**
Aircraft leasing is going through a boom phase in Ireland, but it is the essence of a global industry. Much of the local 
talent originated in GPA. Aer Lingus chairman **Colm Barrington**is chief executive of Dublin-based Fly Leasing. 
He began his aviation career with Aer Lingus in 1967 and joined GPA in 1979, where he became chief operating 
officer.
Probably the youngest of the GPA graduates is **Domhnal Slattery**. He has been involved in many investment 
ventures since, on the ground and in the air. His Avolon aircraft leasing company has just raised $300 million from 
Singapore's sovereign investment fund.
World domination: flight of the Irish executives
Father and son team **Robbie and Ian Burns**are making waves in the Caribbean with their low-cost start-up 
airline, REDJet. Ian Burns, chief executive and chairman, was a partner in Dublin accountancy firm RSM Robson 
Rhodes.
His son Robbie, a graduate of Trinity College, started working for former GPA employee Denis O'Brien's company 
Digicel in the region and is business development manager. The pair hold 25 per cent of the airline's shares.
Establishing an airline in a fragmented market with long-time incumbents such as LIAT and Air Jamaica was always 
going to be a challenge. An initial plan to fly to the US from Jamaica did not get a licence, so REDJet was born in 
Barbados, from where it serves Trinidad and Guyana, with new routes to Jamaica and Antigua commencing this 
week.
Back in the Middle East, Dermot Mannion is not the only member of the Irish aviation diaspora. The Australian chief 
executive of Etihad, **James Hogan**, does a good impression of an Irishman with the airline's hurling sponsorship 
and supposed interest in buying a stake in Aer Lingus.
But the real Irish connections at Etihad were both hired in 2009. Former Ryanair company secretary and head of 
legal and regulatory affairs **Jim Callaghan**is general counsel and executive vice-president of legal affairs at the 
Abu Dhabi airline. Fellow Irishman and former RBS European human resources manager **Ray Gammell**is now 
Etihad's chief people and performance officer.

Robin Hood airport near Doncaster was the last commercial airport to open in the UK. The former RAF base was 
converted by Peel Holdings, the private conglomerate with interests from property to transport. Its long runway, built 
for Vulcan bombers, could handle long-haul flights but it has attracted mostly charter traffic.
Opened in 2005, within three years it had 1m passengers annually but that number fell to 900,000 in 2010 as the 
recession bit.
"The competition is very strong," said Robin Tudor, of Peel Airports.
Robin Hood hosts flights from TUI's Thomson brand, Thomas Cook, Wizz Air, and Ryanair in the summer months.
While it will miss a target of 6m passengers annually by 2016 it still hopes to have 10m passengers annually by 
2030. Some 6m people live within an hour's drive and a new link road from the M1 will put it within 25 minutes of 
Sheffield, a city of 500,000. A railway line runs alongside and there are plans for a station.
"Greater accessibility will attract more airlines," said Mr Tudor. "All the facilities are in place."
By contrast Liverpool, which had been a sleepy charter hub a decade ago, has seen massive growth with £100m 
investment by Peel. It is continuing to expand, with more than 5m passengers in 2010. Around 40 per cent come 
from beyond Merseyside, into Manchester airport's traditional territory.
Manchester remains the north's biggest hub with around 20m passengers annually and more than 200 destinations.
Airlines are able to play airports off against each other, to get the lowest charges possible.
Ryanair pulled all but two routes from Manchester in 2009, opening a base in nearby Leeds/Bradford airport 
instead. But in July it returned with 13 routes.
Accessibility is key to meeting passenger targets Robin Hood
Penny Coates, chief operating officer of Manchester airport, said at the time: "We've seen a decline in passenger 
numbers over the last two or three years particularly since the recession kicked in."
She said the airport had lost Ryanair passengers to Liverpool and to Leeds, adding: "We want those passengers 
back to fly here from Manchester."

THE chief executives of rival airlines Virgin Atlantic, easyJet, Ryanair and the IAG group - which includes British 
Airways - do not normally agree to share a platform. That they chose to yesterday morning - outlining their 
opposition to Air Passenger Duty (APD) - is a sign of how seriously the aviation sector takes this issue.
The UK has the highest aviation taxes of any country in the world, netting the Treasury an anticipated £2.5bn this 
year. APD has increased by between 140 per cent for short haul and 325 per cent for long haul between 2007 and 
2010; and at the same time passenger numbers travelling by air have, on Civil Aviation Authority figures, declined 
from 240m to 210m. To make matters worse, the chancellor plans to increase APD by double inflation next year.
In addition to the significant additional cost implications for business people, holidaymakers and the travelling public 
generally, there are a number of significant economic knockon effects from the UK's high level of APD. The first is 
its profound impact on inbound tourism. As an example, take China, one of the world's fastest growing outbound 
tourism markets. Since 2000, global Chinese outbound tourism expenditure has risen by in excess of 400 per cent. 
Yet visitor expenditure in the UK from China has increased by just 125 per cent.
The reason? A family of four from China will pay £600 more to visit the UK than most other EU countries - a 
combination of higher visa and APD costs. In fact, last year 3m Chinese tourists came to Europe yet only 127,000 
of them visited the UK. We're losing out on a huge growth market at a time when the British economy would benefit 
immeasurably from the inbound investment this sort of tourism brings. The impact on UK businesses is also 
significant.
This tax will not fly: Don't ground Britain 's growth New Year rises in flight duties are a risk to thousands of jobs 
in the UK
Business class passengers leaving UK airports pay some 8.5 times the average of other countries in Europe, which 
still levy a charge. The Netherlands recently abolished their APD altogether because of the economic damage it 
was doing. Research by the Fair Tax on Flying alliance found that businesses alone paid the Treasury around 
£600m last year in aviation tax; and according to a recent British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) report, were APD 
to be increased by 5 per cent in real terms every year - a very likely scenario - there would be incredibly serious 
consequences for the UK economy. The increase in ticket prices would have a knock-on effect on jobs and growth. 
The BCC report found that growth could be curtailed by more than £1bn by 2015, with a potential loss to the 
economy of £3bn by 2020. In the words of the report, this "could reach a staggering £100bn by 2030". Similarly, up 
to 25,000 jobs could be affected by 2015.
APD is bad for the UK economy, and hurts aviation's ability to deliver jobs and growth. Almost 1m jobs depend on 
aviation, and a further 2.6m jobs on tourism in this country. The damaging impact of high and increasing levels of 
APD on the UK's ability to grow and prosper in these tough economic time is clear. The Treasury must urgently re-
think its plans for a double inflation increase in the next Budget. Darren Caplan is chief executive of the Airport 
Operators Association. The AOA represents over 70 airport operators in the UK, and is also a member of the Fair 
Tax on Flying campaigning alliance.

FOUR of Britain's biggest airlines put aside their differences yesterday to lobby the government to scrap its air 
passenger duty (APD), which they slammed as uncompetitive.
Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have written to the chancellor arguing the tax on passengers, 
set to rise by twice the rate of inflation in 2012, puts off tourists from spending money in Britain, cancelling out the 
revenues from the levy. "There's not much these four airlines agree on," said Ryanair's chief executive Michael 
O'Leary. "I think BA's fares are too high, and Willie [Walsh] thinks our service is too low, but we agree on this."
Passengers have to pay between £24 and £170 in APD, depending on the length of flight, substantially more than 
when the tax started in 1994.
EasyJet chief Carolyn McCall claimed that while the charge was introduced as an environmental tax, the Treasury 
now admits that it is used as a revenue-raising measure.
All four were keen to stress that passengers, rather than the airlines, will feel the benefit of scrapping this duty.
Walsh derided the tax as a "whip round" for the chancellor, but pointed to the Netherlands, which ditched a similar 
tax after just a year when it found it was taking £300m a year but losing more than £1bn in tourism.
"We believe families should be entitled to taking a break… We believe it's a right not a privilege people have to take 
a holiday."
The Treasury, which hopes to recoup £3bn from APD in 2012, said yesterday that the government had frozen the 
tax this year, and that it has consulted on reform. THE FORUM: P25 WILLIE WALSH | BRITISH AIRWAYS / IAG 
Airlines lobby to axe levy on passengers TRANSPORT
Walsh, the chief exec of British Airways parent IAG, led the quartet in tearing into the tax yesterday, noting how rare 
it was for all four companies to agree on something. "How often do you see the bitter rivalry - some might say 
hatred - for each other put aside?" MICHAEL O'LEARY | RYANAIR Ryanair's chief executive O'Leary has 
previously spoken out against a tourist tax in Ireland, calling it "disastrous".
He joked yesterday that he might set up a campsite outside parliament until the air passenger duty in the UK is 
dropped.
CAROLYN MCCALL | EASYJET EasyJet's chief was adamant that the airlines are only concerned about the 
economy, rather than their profits or shirking green taxes: "It's an easy accusation to make that airlines don't take 
their environmental responsibilities seriously, but it's not the case."
STEVE RIDGWAY | VIRGIN ATLANTIC Ridgway, who has run Virgin Atlantic since 2001, was occasionally 
drowned out by the more vociferous chiefs at yesterday's press conference, but noted: "The Prime Minister has said 
tourism is going to be a key point in the [economic] recovery."

Airline bosses have called on UK chancellor, George Osborne, to axe Air Passenger Duty. They argue that the 
charge has a negative impact on the UK economy that outweighs any benefit from the revenue raised.
Michael O'Leary from Ryanair, Carolyn McCall from easyJet, Willie Walsh from IAG and Steve Ridgway from Virgin 
Atlantic point to a similar air tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in 2008/09. That levy was abandoned after a 
year after a study claimed that its harmful effects on the Dutch economy were four times greater than the revenue it 
produced.
The letter points to figures showing passenger numbers at UK airports have fallen consecutively over the past three 
years, dipping beneath 2004 levels. While UK airports saw 7.4m fewer passengers in 2010, the number using 
European airports grew by 66.3m.
The chief executives have challenged Mr Osborne to commission an independent report into the economic effects 
of aviation tax in Britain. In their letter they say: "Aviation doesn't just drive exports - it is a major exporter in its own 
right with our airlines earning nearly £11bn of foreign revenues every year." The airline chiefs say they support 
emissions trading (ETS) in principle but that a combination of the Air Passenger Duty and ETS would be 
unsustainable. In Northern Ireland, the Treasury recently accepted that APD was distorting the economy and 
reduced it by 80pc for transatlantic passengers.

Three major British airlines and one Irish carrier have called upon the government to slash the Air Passenger Duty 
(APD).
British Airways, Virgin and easyJet have raised the demand along with Ireland-based Ryanair, according to a BBC 
report.
APD, which was introduced in 1994, is levied on almost every passenger flying from the UK. And there has been a 
sharp increase in the tax; earlier a passenger had to pay somewhere between 5 and 40 pounds per ticket. Now one 
has to pay anywhere between 24 and 170 pounds.
A business or first class traveller has to spend more than those with an economy ticket. The amount will vary 
depending on the number of flying hours.
The airlines complain that such a duty makes Britain a less preferred holiday destination and penalises British 
holidaymakers.
A treasury official said that the government has frozen the duty this year and unlike several other countries, the UK 
has not imposed any Value Added Tax (VAT) on flights. Moreover, a range of reforms to APD are being considered, 
including simplifying the tax and imposing it on private jets.
APD was reduced for direct long-haul flights from Northern Ireland from early November, in response to competition 
from services in the Irish Republic which has an Air Travel Tax of just three euros to any destination.
The BBC has claimed that George Osborne has put this year's increases on hold but is likely to hike the amount by 
10 per cent in 2012.
The airlines are demanding that APD, which was introduced to combat greenhouse gas emissions, should be 
scrapped with the introduction of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme next year.
"Removing APD would not increase the airlines' profits", Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said.
Major Airlines Seek Repeal of Air Passenger Duty
"This has nothing to do with our profits. It is paid by families, paid by passengers going on holidays," he said. "If it is 
scrapped, the money goes straight back into families' pockets."
Additionally, UK passengers will be doubly taxed with the new Emissions Trading Scheme tax from January, he 
pointed out.
IAA chief executive Willie Walsh has also urged the Chancellor to set up an independent review of APD.

The Treasury is refusing to give a direct response to a plea by four airline chiefs to scrap the Air Passenger Duty 
(APD) air departure tax, in order to help the British economy.
In an open letter, the bosses say that the damage done by the tax far outweighs the revenues it creates.
A Treasury spokesperson would only give the department's position on APD.
"The Government took action by freezing APD this year," said Robbie Browse, press office manager at the 
Treasury. 
"We consulted on a range of reforms to APD, including simplifying the tax and making it fairer by extending APD to 
private jets. We will say more on this in the coming weeks.
"It is also important to remember that the UK is not the only country with an passenger duty, and unlike many other 
countries the UK does not levy VAT on flights."
Passenger numbers have fallen for three consecutive years - by 7.4million - while European airport passengers 
have boomed, increasing by 66.3million.
Holland's abandonment of air tax for passengers, as its damage to the Dutch economy was four times that of the 
cash it raised, is highlighted by the letter as an example of why the duty should be scrapped.
Ryanair's charismatic boss Michael O'Leary, IAG CEO Willie Walsh, Easyjet's chief Carolyn McCall, and Virgin 
Atlantic's head Steve Ridgway all signed the letter.
As APD was doubled in 2007 and raised year on year, the UK now has the highest air taxes for passengers in the 
world, they claim.
"For hard-working families, APD is a tax too far for the privilege of taking a well-earned holiday. It is also a tax on 
tourism and a tax on business," read the letter.
Treasury Tight Lipped on Airline Bosses' Calls to Scrap Air Passenger Duty Tax
"Aviation doesn't just drive exports - it is a major exporter in its own right with our airlines earning nearly £11 billion 
of foreign revenues every year. Tourism is one of the UK's most important earners and is worth £115 billion to the 
UK economy.
"We take our responsibility to the environment very seriously and have taken steps to reduce our impact. We 
support an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in principle but a combination of both APD and ETS when it is 
introduced is unsustainable."
Willie Walsh told the BBC that APD "has to be axed for the benefit of families in the UK, jobs in the UK and the 
economy in the UK".
Walsh was asked why the airlines couldn't just absorb the taxes, rather than pass them on to passengers.
"Airlines don't make vast profits. The industry has collectively never returned its course of capital," he replied.

The brainchild of Irish engineer John Power, online retail store Jaktogo offers travelers airport-ready luggage that 
transforms from a tote bag to a jacket and back again.
Brilliant idea or ridiculous invention? You be the judge.
According to Jaktogo.com, "Only fools pay for extra luggage, clever people have Jaktogo!"
Power flies for business about once and week and the hassles and fees he's encountered along the way gave him 
the idea for constructing wearable luggage.
Power is well aware that his jacket wouldn't fly down the runways at fashion week in New York or Paris. It's meant 
for a different kind of runway.
He seems to understand the power of humor in promoting his product.
"[It's] not a fashion plate," he told Tampa's 10 News earlier this week.
Jaktogo's Facebook page makes the point even more clear:
"Jaktogo was created out of necessity and is definitely not a fashion item."
However, Power notes that the 14 pockets make the apparatus a life-saver at the airport.
"I've seen so many people getting upset," Power told 10 News. "'Too much pounds.' 'Too heavy.' 'Couldn't afford to 
pay it.' And hence, Jaktogo came to life."
According to Power, you're only meant to wear the overstuffed jacket/bag for a few minutes when you're boarding 
the plane. At other times -- specifically when you're going through security -- it should be in bag form.
A homemade video from Jaktogo.com (below) explains how to load the jacket up and wear it through the airport. 
You may be amused to find that, for a promotional video, Power does encounter some trouble at the airport. The 
situation is resolved when he shows the lady at the counter that he is, in fact, wearing a coat.
Jaktogo: A Wearable Solution to Baggage Fees
"Yes, but you need wear it," the airline workers says.
Jaktogo's stylings range from a puffy trash-bag-like dress for women to the original trench coat style for men. In

Powers told BBC Radio that the Jaktogo can save approximately $100 on a return flight on low-cost airlines like

So far, so good. Low-cost carriers tend to weather economic downturns better than their more traditional airline 
counterparts. The UK's EasyJet, like Ireland's Ryanair, is proving no exception this time round. Revenue per seat, 
in constant currencies, increased 3.4 per cent in the year to September - it accelerated by 9.4 per cent in the 
summer quarter, more than double its clip of the previous three months. Load factors were stable amid signs that a 
growing number of cash-conscious business travellers are seeking budget options. Almost one in five EasyJet 
passengers now travels for work. More than half of EasyJet's customers started their flights outside the UK.
But if revenues look relatively resilient, investors have more reason to fret on the cost front. Fuel costs were £184m 
higher in 2011 - up 12 per cent on a per seat basis - and will increase by £220m in 2012, EasyJet warns. That will 
not be the end of the pressures. Unit costs excluding fuel and currency factors were slightly lower in 2011 but are 
expected to increase by 2-3 per cent this year. Milking as much revenue as possible from the customer base will be 
essential - and EasyJet's plan to trial fixed seat bookings is a step in that direction.
Given the uncertain outlook, the consensus forecast for 2012 pre-tax profit of £214m is 14 per cent below this 
year's outcome. EasyJet shares, down by more than a fifth this year, trade on a multiple of almost 10 times, a 
discount to Ryanair's 12-plus times, but nothing to get excited about. Investors, however irrationally, take some 
comfort from the £150m special dividend, agitated for by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet's founder and largest 
shareholder, although they may wonder if the distractions he poses to management are worth it. With economic 
turbulence likely, a focus on the controls will be essential.

Full-year profits advance 61%
Group announces maiden dividend
Body
EasyJet is breaking with one of the key principles of low-cost airlines as it begins a trial of allocating seats on some 
routes.
Starting this spring, the budget carrier will allow passengers on some flights to pay a surcharge to choose a seat in 
advance. Carolyn McCall, chief executive, said it was too early to say how much this option would cost travellers, 
nor how many or which routes would be included in the trial. She added that "if it increases boarding time we won't 
do it".
Similar products such as speedy boarding, which wins you a spot at the front of the queue, and flexible fares, which 
allow free date changes, helped draw 1m more business passengers this year than last and pushed up ancillary 
revenues 12.9 per cent to £11.52 a seat. Baggage fees and a £2.50 increase in the booking charge also 
contributed to that rise.
The London-listed airline reported record pre-tax profits of £248m in the 12 months to the end of September, up 61 
per cent on the previous year - which was hit by ash cloud disruptions - in line with analysts' expectations. 
Revenues rose 16 per cent to £3.45bn, while a low tax rate boosted earnings per share 85 per cent to 52.5p.
EasyJet confirmed it would pay a dividend for the first time, after bowing to a protracted campaign by Sir Stelios 
Haji-Ioannou, its founder and biggest shareholder. On top of a special dividend of £150m, an ordinary pay-out of 
10.5p brings the total to £195m.
EasyJet to trial flight seat allocations
The shares fell 2.6 per cent to 356.4p on Tuesday, in part on the company's forecasting a 2-3 per cent rise in non-
fuel costs this year. But Neil Glynn at Credit Suisse said the increase was reasonable given inflationary pressures 
at many of the airports to which EasyJet flies, and he predicted it would be offset by revenue rises.
Ms McCall said she had not spoken to Sir Stelios, whose family hold 38 per cent of the company, about the seat-
allocation trial. While the policy of open seating helps carriers cut aircraft turnround times, Ryanair's move this 
spring into reserved seating on some flights has not pushed up its 25-minute turnrounds.
Sir Stelios said on Tuesday that he remained unhappy with the level of capital expenditure on aircraft going forward 
and questioned assumptions behind the company's assertion that return on capital this year was 11.7 per cent, 
calling the calculation "creative accounting".
As such, he said, "I will not be able to support the re-election of these directors during the 2012 AGM".

Ryanair has renewed its call for an extraordinary meeting at Aer Lingus, where the low-cost carrier holds a 29.8 per 
cent stake.
The budget airline sent a second letter in two weeks to Ireland's flag-carrier demanding a meeting to vote on two 
resolutions - that the company publish a report into a redundancy scheme that led to a EUR30m (£25.6m) fine by 
Ireland's inland revenue; and that the board promise not to make any further payments to the group's defined 
contribution pension schemes.

Body
Budget airline easyJet PLC reported an 86 percent increase in full-year profit but warned Tuesday of significant 
economic headwinds in the current year.
Profit after tax rose to 225 million pounds ($358 million) in the year to end-September, compared to 121 million 
pounds a year earlier. Revenue was 16 percent higher at 3.45 billion pounds.
As announced in September, the airline plans a special dividend of 150 million pounds, plus the 10.5 pence per 
share dividend, equal to 20 percent of basic earnings per share. In total, shareholders are due 195 million pounds.
Gert Zonneveld, analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co., said it was "doubtful whether revenue increases can fully offset 
anticipated cost increases in the current year."
"Over the medium term, however, the outlook continues to be highly attractive in our view," Zonneveld said. He 
added that easyJet may benefit from International Airlines Group's planned takeover of BMI, which is expected to 
lead to a decrease in BMI's European services.
The carrier cautioned that it has felt the economic squeeze, with holiday bookings between June and August down 
4 percent year-on-year. It added that weak consumer confidence makes it more difficult to pass on higher costs for 
fuel and taxes to passengers.
The carrier's shares were down 1.6 percent at 360 pence on the London Stock Exchange.
Following the lead of its larger rival, Ryanair, easyJet said it would begin a trial of selling assigned seats early next 
year.
That may be most attractive to business travelers, which easyJet has been eager to attract. The company said it 
had 1 million more business passengers during the year, to a total of 9.5 million.
The airline's management faces continuing criticism from Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the company's founder and biggest 
shareholder with a 26 percent stake; he and his family have a combined 38 percent share.
easyJet warns of economic headwinds
Haji-Ioannou recently wrote to easyJet's chairman, Mike Rake, demanding that easyJet raise its dividend payout 
further, to 50 percent of earnings and allow shareholders to vote on all new orders for aircraft. If not, he said he 
would vote against the reappointment of the current board of directors.

Ryanair renewed pressure on long-time rival Aer Lingus today to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to 
discuss its E400 million pension deficit and a tax settlement with the government.
Aer Lingus' largest shareholder with a near 30pc stake, Ryanair has been a thorn in the former flag-carrier's side for 
years, constantly criticising its management and performance and twice having takeover bids rebuffed on 
competition grounds.
Ryanair said Aer Lingus had rejected a Nov.1 letter calling for an EGM partly because Ryanair's company secretary 
had not signed the document.
In response, Ryanair has issued a new letter signed by its company secretary and published correspondence it has 
received from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) saying that an investor holding more 
than 10 percent of a company's stock can requisition an EGM. "We now call on the ODCE and the Irish Stock 
Exchange, to take appropriate action to ensure that the board of Aer Lingus complies with their corporate 
governance obligations," Ryanair said in a statement. A spokesman for Aer Lingus said its legal team was dealing 
with Ryanair's calls and had no further comment to make. In a letter from Aer Lingus' lawyers, released by Ryanair 
today, the company's legal advisors said Ryanair's correspondence on the issue of an EGM was "bordering on 
harassment". The government is considering selling its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus as part of a sale of state 
assets under an EU-IMF bailout but the group's pension deficit, which is larger than the group's 380 million euros 
market value, is a major stumbling block. Ryanair, which has said it would consider selling its stake to whoever 
buys the government share in Aer Lingus, wants the airline's board to confirm that it has no obligation to make any 
additional payment to its pension scheme. Aer Lingus said in August that it had no obligation to fund the pension 
deficit but warned that this position could be open to a legal challenge.

Biotech is being targeted to develop existing expertise, says Simon Mee
Body
As anyone who flies to Brussels on a low-cost airline knows, you don't land at your intended destination.
Instead you arrive at "Brussels South Charleroi" airport, an hour's drive to the south of the capital. The airport, 
which has signed deals with several low-cost airlines, including Ryanair, is attracting record traffic at the expense of 
its rivals.
In 2010, 5.1m passengers passed through the airport, a 32 per cent increase on the year before.
Its success comes amid efforts by the regional government to position Wallonia as a low-cost logistics centre, luring 
companies and traffic away from neighbouring regions.
It is a success, however, that threatens to leave the region particularly vulnerable to any slowdown in European 
trade.
Positioned between Germany, France and the Netherlands, Wallonia can present itself as a logistics hub for the 
whole European market. With 60m consumers within a three-hour drive of Liège ( see case study, below ), the local 
authorities expect to capitalise on companies' renewed drive to centralise distribution as they seek efficiencies in a 
stagnating European market.
Johnson & Johnson, the US pharmaceuticals group, is indicative of this trend. Five years ago it centralised its 
European logistics operations, cutting the number of distribution centres, spanning several countries, from 23 to 
five. It chose to locate its main facilities at Courcelles and La Louvière - the latter consolidating activities previously 
dispersed across 15 European sites - both located near the industrial city of Charleroi.
The company says several factors were instrumental in the decision to locate in Wallonia. Foremost was the dense 
road network and proximity to North Sea ports. "Wallonia was good in terms of motorways, airports and transport 
companies," Johnson & Johnson says.
Aim is to build on hub status
"It also had a labour force available to work there. Unemployment is high in the region, and that was important for 
us in terms of recruiting a lot of people in a short time."
Furthermore, Wallonia benefits from a lack of traffic congestion - a problem that affects its northern neighbour, 
Flanders - attracting companies in their drive to lower transport costs.
However, it was the grant offered by the regional government that was "the tipping point", the company adds. In the 
past decade, the regional authority has played an active role in attracting foreign investment, drawing in other 
international companies, such as H&M, the Swedish clothing group.
Since 2000, the logistics sector has created 3,000 jobs, with the industry accounting for 15 per cent of regional 
gross domestic product in 2010.
"As present, Wallonia represents the best-value proposition in Europe for the location of logistics activities," says 
Bernard Piette, general manager of Logistics in Wallonia, a regional trade promotion group.
According to the most recent study by Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm that carries out a 
biennial ranking of European logistics locations, Wallonia is top for market access, location, transport infrastructure 
and cheap land costs.
The sector's success may prove a double-edged sword, however, leaving the region more dependent on European 
trade flows than ever.
A particular worry is the slowdown in the German economy, which, until this autumn, had been the main engine of 
European growth.
Germany ranks third to France and the Netherlands as a destination for Wallonian exports, says Mr Piette. But with 
European demand likely, at best, to stagnate in the short term, the region's logistics industry may face a difficult 
future as manufacturing orders decline.
In an effort to sustain activity in the sector, the regional government has targeted niche areas that require expertise.
The field of "biologistics", which caters for life sciences materials, constitutes a focus for the region, and benefits 
from the presence of such pharmaceutical groups as Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and UCB.
Speed, traceability and reliability are the primary drivers of biologistics, according to Hugues Van Espen, project 
manager of Biolog Europe, a subsidiary of Logistics in Wallonia.
"It is all about developing the concept of biologistics in Wallonia," Mr Van Espen says. "We are trying to bring all the 
actors together - the pharmaceutical, biotech and transport companies working in this environment - to take the 
logistics sector further."

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said it has written again to Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL.L) 
calling on them to accede to Ryanair's request to an EGM so that shareholders can discuss and express their 
opinion upon the continuing "cover up" of the Deloitte & McCann Fitzgerald Report, as well as address the issue of 
further contributions to Aer Lingus' defined contribution pension schemes, without shareholder approval.
Ryanair stated that it has rejected Aer Lingus' legally invalid claim that its previous requisition was invalid because it 
was signed "pp" by Ryanair's Company Secretary. The company added that in order to remove this spurious claim, 
it has tabled a new requisition signed personally by its Company Secretary.
In addition, Ryanair said it released a letter from Aer Lingus' lawyers Arthur Cox and a letter from the Office of the 
Director of Corporate Enforcement, or ODCE, which confirmed in writing that the Directors of Aer Lingus "must 
proceed to convene the EGM "..." where the requisition is properly made".

The ISEQ rose this morning but fell back from earlier highs after an auction of up to E3 billion of five-year Italian 
bonds failed to provide relief to investors.
By 12:30pm, the ISEQ was up 7.69 points to 2,704.80.
Italy paid a record 6.29pc yield to sell five-year bonds today in the first auction held after former European 
Commissioner Mario Monti was asked to head an emergency government charged with tackling the debt crisis. 
Italy, which last week saw bond yields soar past the 7 percent level that has triggered international bailouts of 
Ireland and Portugal, raised the maximum targeted amount of 3 billion euros at the sale.
Kingspan has updated the market for the period from July 1st to September 30th. With nine-month sales up 30pc 
year-on-year (yoy) to E1.14bn, the group is now guiding to FY11 operating profit in the range E82-85m. This is 
comfortably ahead of the Davy estimate of E79m and broadly in-line with consensus forecasts. Like-for-like (lfl) 
sales growth slowed from +16pc yoy in H1 to +9pc yoy in Q3. Construction activity has eased in the group's 
markets due to persistent economic uncertainty, especially in Europe. Sales of insulated panels increased by 13pc 
yoy in the quarter versus growth of 22pc in H1. Order intake remains solid with orders up 8pc and 16pc yoy in the 
UK and Western Europe respectively. In Central and Eastern Europe, order intake rose 7pc yoy due to strength in 
Germany. Shares in the Cavan-based group rose 12c to E6.12. easyJet will report full year results tomorrow with a 
briefing. Guidance from the pre-close statement on September 21st implied expectations of PBT of £240-250m 
(Davy: £246.1m), implying ROCE of just over 12pc. A special dividend of £150m will be recommended to be paid 
out in January which, with the ordinary dividend, brings the dividend yield to 12.5pc. Ryanair shares fell 1c to E3.66. 
Ferry group ICG is due to release an IMS later today. Davy is predicting the group to continue to gain market share 
in a sluggish freight market. The overall picture is one of stagnant freight volumes on the island of Ireland; with the

Body
Ryanair has called on the Government to force the Dublin Airports Authority (DAA) to reduce Dublin Airport's 
charges by at least 40pc.
It said it wants the price cut in line with the recently announced reduction in Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) charges, 
after the DAA confirmed it will not be reducing its passenger charges for 2012.
The new charges will apply from January 1st next until the end of 2015 and will decline by 25pc next year and by 
6pc annually for the subsequent years up to 2015.
The decline is due largely to a reduction in capital investment by the authority over the period and was flagged 
earlier this year following a consultation process. Ryanair claims that Dublin Airport is the most expensive of the 
160 airports it operates to and from, "which is why the DAA's Dublin traffic has plummeted by 20pc to just 18.4m in 
2010, from a peak of 23.4m passengers in 2008". "Dublin Airport continues to suffer traffic declines while Ireland's 
largest airline, Ryanair, continues to grow. In light of today's confirmation that the DAA monopoly will not reduce 
charges in 2012 the Irish Government must take action to force a reduction of at least 40pc to DAA Dublin charges, 
which is in line with reductions recently announced by the IAA," according to Ryanair's Stephen McNamara.

Mixed reactions to early retirement scheme
Mixed reactions to early retirement scheme
Sunday Business Post

Body
The deadline for the public service early retirement scheme is looming, and while thousands of applications have 
already been received from public service workers, many other workers are still mulling it over.
In a bid to reduce the public sector pay bill -- and to cut staff numbers by 37,000 by 2015 -- the government has 
used the sweetener of pensions and lump sums calculated on pay levels prior to the salary cuts and pension levy 
introduced in 2009. Expressions of interest must be lodged by November 28 for those intending to retire by 
February 28.
There has been a mixed reaction to the early retirement scheme, as many public servants are unsure what to do in 
the face of ongoing economic uncertainty and another austerity budget looming on December 6.
Unions and sectoral associations are also concerned about what will happen in the event of a large exodus of 
employees from frontline services. Among areas expected to be most affected are teaching, policing, nursing and 
other healthcare sectors.
While there are no central figures available for the numbers likely to retire throughout the whole public service, 
media reports and estimates have ranged from a minimum of around 5,000 to a maximum of 8,500.
While some government departments directly receive the retirement applications, other applications go to 
management in local authorities, semi-state bodies and the likes of the HSE.
Liam Doran, general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) said that, while it was "difficult 
to be precise" on the likely number of early retirements among his members, he believed it would be between 1,200 
and 1,300.
"There are normally around 700 to 750 retirements each year, without any extra incentives," he said.
Mixed reactions to early retirement scheme
"We ran a series of seminars on this issue called 'Should I stay or should I go?' in recent weeks in Dublin, Cork and 
Limerick, and over 700 members attended. That is a very strong number on a single-issue matter."
He said the INMO's assessment was that most of the retirements next February would arise mainly from core 
nursing management grades and the public health and mental health spheres, because of the older profile of 
nurses in the latter areas, and the fact that management have better salaries.
Doran was critical of the government's decision not to stagger retirements under the scheme.
"Not even [Ryanair boss] Michael O'Leary in his most aggressive mode of running a company would have a 
situation where everyone -- in any grade -- could retire on the same day," he said. "The scheme should be 
staggered. There is no rhyme or reason to the current set-up, and it will impact on services if six or seven people, 
for example, leave in one area on the same day."
While there has already been a significant number of early retirements from the higher echelons of the Garda S och 
na, rank-and-file members are also weighing up their options, according to the Garda Representative Association 
(GRA).
Garda  are different from other members of the public service: they can retire after 30 years' service, ahead of the 
standard 40 years' service. According to GRA general secretary PJ Stone, garda  who retire after March 1 will get  
1,000 less pension per year.
"Realistically, any garda  who were planning to retire in the later months of 2012 or even 2013, or who would be 
soon obliged to leave at 55 on age grounds, would be very foolish to remain," Stone said.
"While financially it may not make a lot of sense for others, they are fed up, disillusioned and feel they have taken 
enough cuts. There is the fear factor, too, in terms of are we over the worst yet in the country's economy, or is there 
more to come?"
The Garda force currently stands at 14,000. Of that number, 1,300 are entitled to retire early. However, if they 
chose to do so on February 28, there would be repercussions, according to the GRA.
"The government would be delighted -- as it wants this reduction -- but if something unforeseen happened here, we 
would be flying by the seat of our pants," said PJ Stone. "Young guards and sergeants are fearful in terms of 
resources. There is not even a budget for patrol cars, but they are the basic tools of the trade. The country has to 
be policed."
Figures provided by the Department of Education to The Sunday Business Post showed that, while 819 primary 
teachers and 709 secondary teachers retired last year, this year to date there had been 1,149 retirement 
applications from the former group and 815 from the latter.
Of those applications, 279 primary teachers applied to retire between November this year and February next year, 
while 190 secondary teachers wanted to retire over the same period.
The Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) predicted that around 500 primary teachers would retire by 
February. A spokesman said it was likely that the numbers retiring would increase as the deadline for applications 
approached.
"Over recent months, our officials have been handling a greatly increased number of retirement enquiries. The 
union also ran information meetings throughout the country for teachers to help them to decide whether to stay or 
go, and there was a lot of interest in them," said the spokesman.
"The vacancies created by retiring teachers will be good news for the hundreds of fully qualified primary teachers 
without regular work, who will be able to step into their roles at greatly reduced salaries."
There are also 24,000 civil servants in the public sector, some of whom may consider early retirement.
Mixed reactions to early retirement scheme
The Public Service Executive Union (PSEU) represents executive and higher executive offer grades, and has 
around 10,000 members.
General secretary Tom Geraghty said the November 28 deadline was not absolute, and that a lot of public servants 
were still "hedging their bets".
"There has been a lot of interest in the scheme, but that doesn't necessarily translate into retirements," he said. 
"People still don't know what the budget will bring, and those who take early retirement get reduced lump sums and 
reduced pensions thereafter."
**Redeployment**
The public service workforce has shrunk by almost 20,000 over the last two years as part of the Croke Park deal 
reached between the last government and unions. By February 28 next, an initial target of 25,000 is set to be 
reached.
However, an increased target of a reduction of 37,000 employees by 2015 has been set by the present 
government. Central to achieving this is redeployment within the sector, which is happening in many areas, 
according to PJ Fitzpatrick, chairman of the Croke Park implementation body.
"On foot of the previous HSE voluntary retirement scheme, there were 700 to 800 staff redeployed throughout the 
service," Fitzpatrick said. "Because of the extra demand on the social welfare services at this time, 600 staff from 
other government bodies and agencies were redeployed there.
"In the education sector, 850 primary teachers have been redeployed, with an annual full year saving of  50 million. 
Around 200 secondary teachers were redeployed at an estimated annual saving of  12 million. There is also other 
redeployment going on within organisations that we are not briefed on.
"Come March 1, and depending on what is contained in the upcoming expenditure review, I would expect 
redeployment to critical frontline areas, and also as a result of the merger and amalgamation of state agencies, like 
the VECs, employment bodies and some local authorities."

Flybe is cutting the number of flights it offers in the UK by 6 per cent this winter in response to slack demand and 
rising oil prices.
Europe's biggest regional airline, which runs 70 per cent of its flights from UK airports, warned last month that 
trading in September had slowed significantly and would pull back half-year sales figures.
On Wednesday it said revenues for the six months to October were 6.4 per cent higher than last year, when the 
volcanic ash disruption dented the performance of airlines across Europe, at £350.2m. That was in line with 
reduced expectations following last month's warning .
Profits were £14.3m, down from last year's £19.8m - before taking into account the cost of the Icelandic ash cloud, 
the group's December 2010 initial public offering and other exceptional factors. After accounting for those one-offs, 
profits in last year's first half were £8.2m.
Passenger revenue per available seat rose 5.8 per cent to £49.88, boosted by higher fares and ancillary revenues.
Analysts at Espírito Santo called the UK winter capacity cuts "appropriate given the weak and uncertain demand 
outlook, and we believe these . . . should support average fares and reduce the volume of unprofitable flying".
Jim French, executive chairman, said the advantage of Flybe's high flight frequency meant it could cut flights 
without cutting routes.
Ryanair, its larger rival operator, is also grounding aircraft this winter , prompted by higher fuel costs. But flag 
carriers have been less flexible.
Nor is Flybe cutting across the board. Flybe Finland, a joint venture with Finnair, is already flying 26 routes and Mr 
French said he expected the Finnish business to drive up capacity across the group by 7 per cent this winter from 
last.
Flybe makes winter cuts to UK flights
  FT Comment 
Flybe's business model means small changes in revenue translate into big swings in the bottom line. This year has 
demonstrated that starkly, and to investors' chagrin, with analysts halving profit forecasts on the basis of 1 per cent 
revenue shortfalls and the share price diving accordingly; the group now trades at a forward p/e of 8.5. Flybe has 
responded by cutting variable costs and is pushing actively into continental Europe, where it sees opportunities for 
consolidation. Both efforts should help smooth its performance, but it could also benefit from International Airline 
Group's deal to buy BMI British Midland. If the sale goes through, chances are good that Willie Walsh, IAG's chief 
executive, will cut some of his lossmaking target's regional routes, easing competition for Flybe. Here, the 
disproportional relationship between top and bottom line could prove pleasing.

Escape the early winter chills with these travel deals on airfare, cruises, and getaways. It's important to note most of 
these sales blackout Thanksgiving and Christmas dates, but those who have some flexibility can snag a great 
bargain this winter.
Airfare
Southwest and its subsidiary Air Tran continue with their sales on one-way tickets starting at $59. Book before Nov. 
14 to grab this deal before it's gone. Travel must be between Nov. 14 and Feb. 14. There are, however, some 
blackout dates before and after Thanksgiving and Christmas. Sample deals include a $59 one-way ticket from Las 
Vegas to San Diego on Southwest or, for the same price, passengers can get a ticket from Charlotte to Orlando. 
Full details on the sales are available on the Southwest or AirTran Web site.
American Airlines has answered Southwest and AirTran's sale with one of their own. Similarly, purchase tickets 
before Nov. 14 and fly before Valentine's Day for big savings. Holiday blackout dates do apply and a Saturday stay 
may be required on some flights. Sample deals include a $59 one-way ticket from JFK to Baltimore, or for $86, 
passengers can fly between Los Angeles and Albuquerque.
For those traveling within Europe, Ryanair has one-way tickets starting at 9 euros - that's less than $13! Taxes and 
fees are, of course, not included in this price. This deal makes it a great time for backpackers or those studying 
abroad to visit other places in Europe during the holiday break. The sale ends Nov. 11, and those who purchase 
tickets must travel Monday-Thursday. See Ryanair's Web site for more information.
Cruises 
Several cruise lines also have big discounts this time of year for anyone looking to escape the winter chill. Orbitz is 
currently running an Autumn Cruise Clearance on dozens of top cruise lines that sail around the world. Orbitz sale 
packages include tons of freebies like upgrades, air fare vouchers, and lots of extra spending money. The sale ends 
on Nov. 22, but it's best to book as soon as possible before the reduced rate rooms sell out.
Getaways
Winter Travel Deals on Airfare, Cruises, and Getaways
Groupon is offering some great getaways for the adventurer or those who just want to relax beachside. Desafio 
Adventure Company has a deal on a four-day Costa Rican all-inclusive weekend warrior adventure packager for 
two. This deal includes airport pick up, a three night stay near the Arenal Volcano, meals, whitewater rafting, 
canopy zip line, and other exhilarating activities. This trip is currently priced on Groupon at $699, half off the original 
price.
If flying on a wire at tree level isn't what you consider fun, try a long relaxing week at one of the World Resorts 
International. This seven night stay is a steal at $399, just $57 per night. The best part about this deal is the 
location; it can be used throughout North America. So, those who want to soak up the sun in Mexico or ski deep 
powder in Park City, Utah can enjoy this coupon. Check out Groupon's Web site for the fine print and details on this 
getaway.

Ryanair has raised its full-year net profit guidance by 10 per cent on the back of stronger-than-expected growth in 
unit revenues in the first half and capacity cuts in the second.
Revenues per passenger at the low-cost carrier increased 11 per cent in the six months to September 30. These 
were pushed up by rising average fares - which include baggage fees - helped by some longer routes.
Operating expenses rose more than twice as quickly, however, driven mostly by higher fuel costs. The company 
had already planned to ground up to 80 of its aircraft this winter in response - a move, according to Michael 
O'Leary, chief executive, which let him now raise full-year net-profit guidance from EUR400m to EUR440m 
(£377m).
Third-quarter bookings on the smaller fleet suggested second-half revenues per passenger-mile - or yields - would 
rise 14 per cent rather than the previously forecast 12 per cent.
The shares climbed 5.1 per cent, to close at EUR3.52 on Monday. "It is somewhat unusual for Ryanair to upgrade 
guidance at the half-year stage," said RBS analysts. "We would thus see this as a marked sign of confidence in the 
outlook."
Gerald Khoo at Espírito Santo praised Ryanair's capacity discipline and pointed out that it came "in contrast to the 
network carriers that continue to plan capacity growth in 2012 , albeit at a slower pace than previously expected".
Where full-service airlines are experiencing softening demand , Mr O'Leary said Ryanair benefited from travellers 
trading down.
In the first half, the budget airline carried 44.7m passengers, 12 per cent more than in the same period last year, 
and held load factors steady, with aircraft 85 per cent full on average.
Ryanair lifts profit guidance by 10%
Profits were 20 per cent higher than last year's underlying figures - which excluded one-off costs related to volcanic 
ash disruption - at EUR620m, on revenues that were 24 per cent higher at EUR2.7bn. Diluted earnings per share 
were 30.38 cents compared with 28.5 cents last year.
Analysts' consensus forecasts had already put full-year net income at EUR442.5m but that may rise on Monday's 
comments.
The group's fuel is 90 per cent hedged for the first half of next year, at $99 a barrel compared with $82 this year.
To absorb those higher prices "we'll have to get fares up by about EUR3 next year", said Mr O'Leary.
While volumes and fare rises were the main contributors to revenue growth, ancillary sales also picked up. Mr 
O'Leary said reserved seating was proving popular on longer flights and had not increased Ryanair's 25-minute 
average turnround times. He expected it to be available on all flights by next summer.

When chief executive Michael O'Leary talks of an "improved product mix", Ryanair's passengers groan: it invariably 
means that the low-cost carrier has found another way to squeeze cash out of them. One of its latest wheezes is a 
EUR10 seat reservation fee. But Ryanair's owners will cheer, because it is one of those rare breeds - a consistently 
profitable airline.
Ryanair raised its full-year profit forecast by 10 per cent on Monday, when it published decent interim figures. The 
revision raises its own projections closer to those of analysts. It is certainly early in the fiscal year to be so bold. But 
the purchase of BMI British Midland by the parent of British Airways last week, mostly for its Heathrow slots, fits 
with Mr O'Leary's theory that flag-carriers are less keen to battle with him in the short-haul market.
That is just as well, because Ryanair faces a big strategic decision in the next two years: whether to expand or to 
return more cash to shareholders. Mr O'Leary's story keeps changing here. In 2009, he called Boeing executives 
"numpties" for failing to agree terms about a 200-aircraft order by which he had hoped to take advantage of the 
latest industry downturn. Then, he said Ryanair would slow its expansion. Last year he hinted at a switch to Airbus 
for new planes. More recently he has suggested a near-doubling of passengers between 2015 and 2021 and 
talking with Chinese and Russian manufacturers.
Expansion has to be the more likely option. To stick with Boeing, Ryanair's current fleet provider, would lower 
maintenance costs, if its executives' bruised feelings could be smoothed over. But investors need not fret. Any new 
orders are at least a couple of years away. Hopes of a 2012 special dividend - a repeat of Ryanair's first-ever pay-
out last year - and maybe another one in 2014, seem realistic.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is planning to introduce a pornography service for its passengers.
Ryanair's chief Michael O'Leary said the airline planned to introduce an app that would allow passengers to watch 
sex footages on their smartphones and iPads. The service would be provided on pay-per-view basis, reported the 
Daily Mail.
"I am not talking about having it on screens on the back of seats for everyone to see. It would be on handheld 
devices. Hotels around the world have it, so why wouldn't we," Michael was quoted as saying by The Sun.
He said it would take at least a year to introduce the service.
The airline also planned to introduce other services like gambling, games and erotic movies, he added.

Ryanair Italian Website on Tuesday 8 November 2011
Even Ryanair is betting on Silvio Berlusconi's defeat after Tuesday's vote on the Italian budget that could force the 
75-year old mogul to step down as prime minister. 
The Irish low-cost airline's Italian website advertises a picture of a Berlusconi's smiling to a crew of beautiful girls in 
bikini. "Dear Silvio, this is another chance to fly away with Ryanair," reads the advertisement. This is not the first 
time that Ryanair teases the media tycoon. Three months ago the company put on a similar picture with another 
suggestion: "I have 560 million of good reasons to run away".
Ryanair's joke clearly refers to Berlusconi's latest gaffe at the G20 meeting in France, in which he dismissed the 
financial crisis hammering Italy. "Restaurants are full, it is difficult to reserve a seat on a plane, and holiday resorts 
during bank holidays are fully booked," Berlusconi said. "If you moved to Italy, I don't think you would sense 
anything that could resemble a strong crisis. We really are a strong economy. Italians are well-off. "

Gripper museum marks big five-oh
January's 50th anniversary of the ah... de Havilland Trident will be marked in style by the museum that holds what 
are thought to be the last remnants of the prototype "Ground Gripper".
The Heathrow Trident Collection, in Feltham, is holding a gathering to mark a half-century since the maiden flight of 
the first Trident - G-ARPA - which took place at Hatfield on 9 January 1962. All that remains of Papa Alpha are the 
pilot's control yoke and a section of fuselage bearing the registration (pictured below right), which is displayed at the 
museum. The rest of this historic aircraft is believed to have disappeared into skips when Papa Alpha was scrapped 
at Prestwick in 1976.
The "G-ARPA + 50" celebration will take place at the museum on Saturday 7 January. Among invited guests will be 
former DH/HS test pilot Desmond Penrose, who flew the chase aircraft for that first flight and later flight-tested the 
Trident during its development.

Reports reach us of British Airways' efforts to improve strained relations between pilots and cabin crew on long-haul 
flights. As part of the carrier's mandatory Safety and Emergency Procedures training session, a teamwork 
discussion looks at ways of breaking down barriers between flight crew and those on the other side of the cockpit 
door, including advice on including all colleagues in any invitation to socialise in the bar down route.
No Headline In Original
Is that wise? As our grizzled former Birdseed pilot turned scribbler notes: "Back in the days of BOAC - bend over 
again Christine - the problem was keeping them apart on hotel stopovers."
Beam me down
Actor William Shatner was the star guest at Bombardier's 15th Safety Standdown in Wichita last month, his 
expertise based presumably on the fact that after five years of avoiding Klingon death rays and swerving around 
supernovas he got the Enterprise back to Earth in one piece.
Rumours that engineers at the airframer are boldly going ahead with a patent for the ultimate proximity protection 
system based on cockpit-activated deflector shields are unfounded.
Naked launch
Expect the usual feminist fury and smug retorts from Ryanair following the unveiling of the low-cost carrier's latest 
glamour charity calendar featuring semi-clad cabin crew.

In dispatches
Mr Quinto Poggioli sends us some interesting details of the work in Tripoli in connection with the Italian-Turkish 
War. He writes: "On 25 October, Capt Piazza with his Bleriot, and Capt Moizo on his Nieuport, observed columns of 
Turks and Arabs of about 6,000 men. The Italians, after receiving this information, could successfully calculate 
distances and arrange for their defence."
Steel leviathan
Convinced of the suitability of stainless steel as a structural material for aircraft, Mr Carl de Ganahl has used this 
metal at the Fleetwings plant, Bristol, Pennsylvania, for the construction of an amphibian monoplane with some 
interesting features.
Flying with Angels
Six navy-blue F11F Tigers with "Blue Angels" painted in gold across their noses had been parked near the static 
display. As the band played Anchors Aweigh, Cdr Zeb Knott, US Navy, led his team to their "Blue Angels" aircraft.
Battle: LA
American Airlines has locked horns with arch-rival United Airlines in the hotly-competitive Los Angeles-San 
Francisco "California Corridor" market, by setting about acquiring Newport Beach-based national carrier AirCal.

RYANAIR raised its 2011 profit forecast by 10 per cent yesterday, saying a focus on more lucrative routes was 
pushing up revenue per passenger and offsetting stubbornly high fuel prices. The budget airline, headed up by 
outspoken boss Michael O'Leary, said it had seen virtually no impact from the global downturn in consumer 
confidence, but warned traffic would fall in the coming months as it grounded 80 aircraft because fuel prices made 
routes unprofitable.
The airline, which flew over 70m passengers last year, said it expected to make a profit of (EURO)440m (£377.6m) 
for its 2011 financial year, up from its previous forecast of (EURO)400m.
Yields -- the keenly watched measure showing average revenue gained per mile per passenger -- will grow at 14 
per cent in the six months to March, up from 12 per cent previously forecast.
The airline earned (EURO)543.5m in the six months to September, up 20 per cent, on revenues of (EURO)2.71bn.

Ryanair has this morning increased its 2011 profit forecast by 10pc, saying higher revenues per passenger mile 
would offset stubbornly high fuel prices.
Europe's largest budget airline, releasing its first-half results, said it had seen virtually no impact from the downturn 
in consumer confidence, but warned traffic would fall in the coming months as it grounded aircraft as a result of high 
fuel prices.
The airline, which flew over 70m passengers last year, said it expected to make a profit before tax of 440 m euros 
for its 2011 financial year, up from its previous forecast of 400 m.
Yields - the keenly watched measure showing average revenue gained per mile per passenger - will grow at 14 pc 
in the six months to March, up from 12 pc previously forecast. "We are well booked for the coming months, 
fractionally ahead of where we were last year," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar. "So far we have not seen 
any impact from recession." The airline earned 452m euros in the six months to September, up 20 pc from a year 
earlier, on revenues of 2.18 bn euros. Net profit before tax for the three months to September were 404m euros, 
beating analysts' average forecasts of 393 m euros. Ryanair closed on Friday at 3.65 euros per share, down 8 pc 
since the beginning of the year, compared with a fall of 23 pc at rival low-cost carrier EasyJet. Industry body IATA 
has said it expects airlines to suffer a weak end to the year due to waning consumer confidence, sluggish 
international trade and high fuel prices. Lufthansa last week reported results battered by high fuel costs, while 
International Airline Group reported a 31 pc fall in third-quarter profit.

Aer Lingus has turned down a request from rival Ryanair to convene an extraordinary general meeting and added 
that any attempt by the 30pc shareholder to convene such a meeting by itself would be invalid.
Aer Lingus said that Ryanair's "purported requisition did not comply with the requirements of Irish company law in 
either substance or form."
Ryanair is the largest minority shareholder in Aer Lingus with a 29.8pc stake.
The rejection follows a series of attempts by Ryanair to get Aer Lingus to hold an EGM to deal with its requests 
including that the company pay a special dividend of E0.20 and to confirm it won't make any additional payments to 
the company's pension schemes without prior shareholder approval. The requisition notice issued by Ryanair calls 
for two motions to be put to an EGM to be held within three weeks. One would call for the publication of the Deloitte/ 
McCann Fitzgerald report, while the second would call on Aer Lingus to state unequivocally that it would not make 
any further contributions to its employee pension schemes. Ryanair said it has not tabled any motion calling on Aer 
Lingus to pay a dividend from its more than E900 million cash reserves but nevertheless continues to call on the 
company to do so. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said recent analysis suggested the passing of the two 
suggested motions might result in the Aer Lingus share price rising from E0.70 to more than E1. The Government is 
considering the sale of its 25.1 pc stake in Aer Lingus.

The ISEQ started the week on a roller-coaster, dropping sharply at the open but closing flat amid fears of debt crisis 
contagion to Italy and uncertainty over the fate of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
The ISEQ rose 0.59 of a point to 2,665.13.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent at 976.24 points, after falling by nearly 2 
percent in early trade. Italy's FTSE MIB , meanwhile reversed early losses to trade up 1.9 percent. "It's the rumour 
on Berlusconi that helps the market trim its losses. The market was down on concerns over Italy, so the only 
possible trigger for a bounce has to come from Italy," said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading, at 
Global Equities, in Paris.
Shares in Ryanair jumped 17c to E3.52 after it posted its latest set of figures. Its net income of E404.2m was ahead 
of estimates while full-year guidance was raised to E440m. A Q2 net income performance of E404.2m, implying an 
adjusted net margin up 2 points to 26pc (growth rate up 29pc on Q2 last year), was ahead of Davy estimates of 
E383.1m (consensus: E395m). Key components included unit costs, ex-fuel, up 5pc or adjusted for sector length, 
up just 1pc. Including fuel costs, they rose 12pc. For the six months, unit costs, ex-fuel and sector length adjusted, 
remained flat. Q2 revenue was up 21pc, driven by traffic growth of 6pc and average fares growth of 17pc (previous 
guidance was for 12-15pc yield growth). Ancillaries grew 9pc, slightly faster than the 6pc passenger growth. Total 
net income for the half-year is now running at E543.5m (up 20pc year-on-year). Net debt has fallen from E708.8m 
at March 2011 to E372.2m despite another E85m share buyback, further illustrating the cash generative ability of 
the company's business model. Aer Lingus shares rose 2c to E0.70 after it said that its total booked passenger 
numbers, including Aer Lingus Regional operations, increased by 1.6pc in October. In the UK, Taylor Wimpey has 
issued an interim management statement covering the period since July 4th. The group reiterates that it is on

completions have been fully sold for the full year and the order book for 2012 is strong at 6,265 versus 5,496 last 
year. Since the first half, the group has acquired 3,793 plots, bringing the total acquired year-to-date to 9,082. 
Shares in Kingspan fell 2c to E6.35. A report says that the AA's motor insurance premium index suggests rates 
have fallen by 3pc year-to-date. The AA index, which is based on a survey, puts the average cost of motor 
insurance at E549, compared with E567 at the start of 2011. The reduction is attributed to lower road traffic 
accident fatalities - Garda statistics show that up to 09.00 on November 4th, fatalities were down by 18pc year-on-
year - and to a drop in car thefts. The AA index differs from the CSO's monthly index which suggests that private 
motor rates at the end of September were up by 0.9pc year-to-date and 5.4pc year-on-year. FBD's shares were

The ISEQ started the week on a roller-coaster this morning, dropping sharply at the open amid fears of debt crisis 
contagion to Italy but rebounding amid talk that Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi could resign soon.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 15.80 points to 2,680.34.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent at 976.24 points, after falling by nearly 2 
percent in early trade. Italy's FTSE MIB , meanwhile reversed early losses to trade up 1.9 percent. "It's the rumour 
on Berlusconi that helps the market trim its losses. The market was down on concerns over Italy, so the only 
possible trigger for a bounce has to come from Italy," said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading, at 
Global Equities, in Paris.
Shares in Ryanair jumped 13c to E3.58 after it posted its latest set of figures. Its net income of E404.2m was ahead 
of estimates while full-year guidance was raised to E440m. A Q2 net income performance of E404.2m, implying an 
adjusted net margin up 2 points to 26pc (growth rate up 29pc on Q2 last year), was ahead of Davy estimates of 
E383.1m (consensus: E395m). Key components included unit costs, ex-fuel, up 5pc or adjusted for sector length, 
up just 1pc. Including fuel costs, they rose 12pc. For the six months, unit costs, ex-fuel and sector length adjusted, 
remained flat. Q2 revenue was up 21pc, driven by traffic growth of 6pc and average fares growth of 17pc (previous 
guidance was for 12-15pc yield growth). Ancillaries grew 9pc, slightly faster than the 6pc passenger growth. Total 
net income for the half-year is now running at E543.5m (up 20pc year-on-year). Net debt has fallen from E708.8m 
at March 2011 to E372.2m despite another E85m share buyback, further illustrating the cash generative ability of 
the company's business model. Aer Lingus shares rose 2c to E0.70 after it said that its total booked passenger 
numbers, including Aer Lingus Regional operations, increased by 1.6pc in October. In the UK, Taylor Wimpey has

completions have been fully sold for the full year and the order book for 2012 is strong at 6,265 versus 5,496 last 
year. Since the first half, the group has acquired 3,793 plots, bringing the total acquired year-to-date to 9,082. 
Shares in Kingspan rose 1c to E6.38. A report says that the AA's motor insurance premium index suggests rates 
have fallen by 3pc year-to-date. The AA index, which is based on a survey, puts the average cost of motor 
insurance at E549, compared with E567 at the start of 2011. The reduction is attributed to lower road traffic 
accident fatalities - Garda statistics show that up to 09.00 on November 4th, fatalities were down by 18pc year-on-
year - and to a drop in car thefts. The AA index differs from the CSO's monthly index which suggests that private

(RTTNews) - The UK market is moderately lower in afternoon trading Monday, with attention turning to Italy where 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's majority will be tested tomorrow, against the backdrop of the resignation of Greek 
Prime Minister George Papandreou.
The European Central Bank's Governing Council Member Yves Mersch has said the ECB is free to change its 
decision on Italian bond purchases if the country fails to take up reforms as promised.
George Papandreou, who survived a vote of confidence in parliament by 153 to 145 votes on Friday, agreed to step 
down on Sunday, after a meeting between Papandreou and opposition leader Antonis Samaras in the presence of 
President Karolos Papoulias.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is declining 0.15 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is dropping 0.54 percent.
The FTSE 100 index has been trading below the central line in a range of 5,441 - 5,527 and is currently losing 0.36

Weir Group is losing 5.7 percent and Essar Energy is declining 4.5 percent
Rentokil Initial is falling 2.1 percent. The company reported a decline in its third-quarter pre-tax profit, as it saw 
wider losses in its City Link parcels segment. Anticipating improved financial performance in the business, the 
company said it expects a solid fourth quarter performance across the group.
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported an increase in its second-quarter profit, helped by increased fares and 
higher passenger numbers. The Irish company also raised its full-year net profit guidance by 10 percent expecting 
higher yields in the second half of the year. The stock is adding 3.9 percent.

Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX is adding 0.40 percent, while the French CAC 40 is dropping 0.27 percent. 
Switzerland's SMI is adding 0.20 percent.
In economic news, Germany's industrial production declined 2.7 percent month-on-month in September, the 
Federal Ministry of Economy and Technology said. The decline was bigger than the 0.9 percent fall forecast by 
economists.
Data released by think tank Sentix showed that Eurozone investor confidence dropped for a fourth month in a row 
in November, to reach the lowest level since August 2009.
Meanwhile, statistical office Eurostat said retail sales in Eurozone decreased 0.7 percent on a monthly basis in 
September, reversing the 0.1 percent rise seen in August. Economists were expecting sales to be flat month-on-

Ryanair Lifts Full-year View As Q2 Profit Rises - Update

(RTTNews) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported Monday an increase in its second-
quarter profit, helped by increased fares and higher passenger numbers. The Irish company also raised its full-year 
net profit guidance by 10 percent expecting higher yields in the second half of the year.
Profit attributable to equity holders increased to 404.2 million euros or 27.31 cents per share in the quarter from 
330.3 million euros or 22.15 cents per share last year. Profit before tax grew to 463.0 million euros from 377.9 
million euros.
Total operating revenues rose to 1.56 billion euros from 1.29 billion euros in the prior-year quarter, owing mainly to 
a 17 percent increase in average fares and a 6 percent increase in passenger numbers.
Fuel expenses, which represented 45 percent of total operating costs compared to 41 percent last year, increased 
by 29 percent to 480.4 million euros due to a higher price per gallon paid and a 12 percent increase in the number 
of hours flown.
Total revenue per passenger for the quarter increased 14 percent primarily due to a 17 percent increase in average 
fare per passenger. Load factor decreased by one point to 87 percent.
For the first half of the year, profit attributable to equity holders increased to 543.5 million euros from 424 million 
euros. Operating revenues increased 24 percent to 2.712 billion euros.
Looking ahead, the company said its traffic would decline by 4 percent in the second half due to capacity cuts. In 
November, the airline expects to report a traffic decline of 10 percent or almost 500,000 passengers as it grounds 
up to 80 aircraft due to higher oil prices.
In a cautious tone, Ryanair said that based on its current third-quarter bookings and limited visibility into the fourth 
quarter, it now expects yields in the second half of the year to rise by up to 14 percent, slightly better than the 12 
percent previously guided.
The company also raised its full year net profit guidance by 10 percent to 440 million euros from 400 million euros, 
subject to the final outturn of the fourth-quarter yields.
Ryanair is 90 percent hedged on fuel charges for fiscal 2012 at $820 per tonne, up 12 percent on last year.

RYA.L is currently trading at 3.4680 pence, up 0.1180 pence or 3.52 percent, on 280,351 shares.

(RTTNews) - European stocks stormed back from early losses on Monday, but most markets finished in the red 
despite optimism that Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was about to step down.
Although Berlusconi said on Facebook that talk of his resignation is "groundless," reports surfaced suggesting that 
his departure is being negotiated and will be announced sometime this week.
Italian borrowing costs have soared to unsustainable levels in recent months, with lenders expressing little faith that 
Berlusconi can make the structural reforms needed to keep Italy from becoming the next Greece.
Meanwhile, in Athens, Prime Minister George Papandreou will reportedly step down as the nation's top parties form 
a new government.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks unofficially lost 0.71 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 
index, which includes some major U.K. companies, declined 0.77 percent.
Unofficially around Europe, the German DAX lost 0.70 percent and Switzerland's SMI eased 0.24 percent. The 
French CAC 40 lost 0.64 percent and the UK's FTSE 100 slipped 0.41 percent. Italy was one of the few markets in 
positive territory.
Deutsche Bank and Nomura cut their price targets on Commerzbank. Nomura also lowered the stock to "Reduce" 
from "Neutral." Commerzbank shares slipped 0.3 percent.
Lufthansa lost 1.6 percent. Deutsche Bank raised the stock to "Hold" from "Sell" and increased the price target to 
11 euros from 9 euros.
Axel Springer rose 11 percent. The print and digital media company reported a decline in third-quarter profit, 
despite strong revenue growth in advertising and digital media. The company continues to expect growth in revenue 
and EBITDA for fiscal 2011.
QSC rose 0.17 percent. The telecommunications provider reported a higher third-quarter profit, as revenues grew 
21 percent helped by consolidation of two new subsidiaries as well as positive new customer development.
In Paris, grocery retailer Carrefour lost 2.4 percent. Citigroup lowered the stock to "Sell" from "Neutral" and cut the 
price target to 15 euros from 18 euros.
European Stocks Pare Early Losses On Hope For Berlusconi Resignation
Credit Agcricole and Societe Generale were down more than 2 percent each amid reports the banks will cut 
hundreds of jobs.
Soc Gen issued a research note saying that a 2012 recession in the euro zone is inevitable, and Morgan Stanley 
downgraded European equities to underweight from neutral.
Alcatel-Lucent was lowered to "Sell" from "Buy" at Citigroup and the price target was reduced to 1 euro from 4.2 
euros. The stock dropped 7.6 percent.
Rentokil Initial fell 2.6 percent. The company reported a decline in its third-quarter pre-tax profit, as it saw wider 
losses in its City Link parcels segment. Anticipating improved financial performance in the business, the company 
said it expects a solid fourth quarter performance across the group.
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported an increase in its second-quarter profit, helped by increased fares and 
higher passenger numbers. The Irish company also raised its full-year net profit guidance by 10 percent expecting 
higher yields in the second half of the year. The stock rose 5 percent.
Sandvik lost 3.25 percent in Stockholm. The company announced a recommended public offer to acquire all 
remaining shares in its subsidiary Seco Tools AB.
Eurozone retail sales decreased in September, as consumer spending remained subdued, raising fears of a 
possible recession in the currency bloc.
Retail sales were down 0.7 percent on a monthly basis in September, reversing the 0.1 percent rise in August, data 
released by statistical office Eurostat showed Monday. Economists were expecting sales to be flat month-on-month.
German industrial output dipped 2.7 percent month-on-month in September, the sharpest drop since the beginning 
of 2009, according to data from the Federal Ministry of Economy and Technology, published Monday. The decline 
was bigger than the 0.9 percent drop forecast by economists and 0.4 percent drop seen in August.

News analysis
Rival carrier is courting disaffected customers, writes Sarah Mishkin
Body
Alan Joyce was the dark horse candidate when he was picked for Qantas's chief executive in 2008 and defeated 
John Borghetti, a career-long Qantas employee and once one of the favourites for the top job.
Mr Borghetti now leads rival Virgin Australia, and is losing no time trying to take advantage of his former employer's 
troubles to snap up disaffected customers.
Mr Joyce's decision to ground the fleet last weekend forced the government to intervene and help end its long-
running dispute with unions angry over plans to cut jobs and base others outside of Australia.
The tactic worked as strikes are suspended while management and unions negotiate a settlement, expected to be 
sealed towards the end of this year or early next, but the backlash continues.
Certain segments of the Australian media have been describing Mr Joyce, a naturalised Australian citizen, as "the 
diminutive Irishman" - a jab at the foreignness of the man seen as trying to weaken Australian unions and base 
more jobs offshore.
Mr Joyce spent Friday morning testifying before a parliamentary inquiry against legislation that could force Qantas 
to base all its subsidiaries at home and pay overseas staff at Australian rates. Also pressing the company is 
competition posed by Virgin Australia and, to a lesser extent, the local subsidiary of Singapore's Tiger Airways.
Under Mr Borghetti, Virgin has been striking alliances with international carriers, such as Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, 
to improve its network.
Virgin edges in after Qantas troubles
Domestically, Qantas dominates the corporate travel market, but Mr Borghetti is trying to double Virgin's share of 
that market to 20 per cent. Because of the additional demand generated by Qantas's slowdown, Virgin will be able 
to meet that goal earlier than expected, Mr Borghetti has said.
Last week, Virgin began selling tickets earlier than planned for seats in its new business class between Sydney, 
Melbourne and Brisbane."[The grounding] gave us an opportunity to show how good we are and how much of a 
really good alternative we are in this country," Mr Borghetti said.
Qantas's overall domestic market share is 65 per cent, but it has nearly 90 per cent of the lucrative corporate 
traveller market. That domestic base is particularly important as its share of international travel is falling. It had just 
18.4 per cent of international passengers this July, down from 19.3 per cent a year earlier, according to a report 
from RBS.
When Mr Joyce emerged as the winner of the 2008 race to become Qantas's CEO, Mr Borghetti had been the 
airline's general manager. Mr Joyce headed Jetstar, the low-cost subsidiary that resembled Ireland's no-frills 
Ryanair more than the flag-carrier he was about to take over.
Staff at Jetstar, Qantas's "small sister", have some union representation, but Mr Joyce was seen as a tough 
negotiator, and the employees there had less generous contracts than Qantas employees, says Greg Bamber, an 
academic at Monash University who has studied the company's industrial relations.
"He was taking a hard line on labour when he was chief executive of Jetstar, so to some extent this is a 
continuation of how he was seen," said Mr Bamber.
Mr Joyce's success building up the Jetstar subsidiary enabled Qantas to use its primary fleet to offer business 
travellers better service than Virgin, while its Jetstar brand challenged Virgin Australia for the tourist market.
Virgin's move to compete with Qantas for business travel could be risky, said Cameron McDonald, an analyst with 
Deutsche Bank. Qantas under Mr Joyce looks to cut costs to improve overall profits, and Virgin is now competing 
for Qantas's business customers on price.
That, says another analyst, could depress Virgin's earnings even if it does win market share. Nonetheless, Qantas' 
problems have given Mr Borghetti an opening for now.

  Vodafone , the mobile phone operator, is expected to report good growth in group revenue and free cash flow in 
line with consensus full-year expectations, writes  Daniel Thomas. However, the company is expected to voice 
concerns about the economic slowdown in certain countries when it reports first-half results.
One country that is expected to receive upbeat comments is the US, where Vodafone's Verizon Wireless joint 
venture paid a $4.5bn discretionary dividend over the summer. There is also optimism over its Indian operations 
despite an unresolved tax case.
The company is expected to report revenues of £23.4bn, up 3.4 per cent on the year, but lower growth than in the 
previous quarter because of price pressure in Spain and more difficult markets in Turkey, Australia and Greece. 
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are forecast to be slightly higher at £7.4bn.
Adjusted earnings per share of 7.7p, down from 8.7p last year, would be consistent with consensus full-year 
expectations and reflect higher interest costs and the exclusion of businesses sold during the period. Free cash flow

is expected to rise to £3.6bn from £3.5bn in the same period last year, but adjusted operating profit is expected to 
have fallen to £5.8bn, from £6bn last year.
  Interim results from Carphone Warehouse are expected to end speculation over the future of the 11 "big box" 
stores in the UK opened by Best Buy Europe, its joint venture with the US electrical retailing giant, writes Claer 
Barrett .
Analysts expect the stores to rack up losses of £70m this year as the UK electrical retail market short circuits, and 
forecast Carphone to confirm the closure of all 11 of them. Although there is no certainty of an announcement, the 
company has previously said the cost of exits from property leases would be about £40m.
Oriel Securities believes confirmation of store closures would cause shares to re-rate, pencilling in a potential 4p 
benefit to 2013 earnings-per-share forecasts, which stand at 20.3p. There is also the question of what would 
happen to the venture's cash reserves of about £120m, which could be funnelled into the expansion of Wireless 
World, the company's more successful small-store format, or even partially returned to shareholders.
Oriel forecasts full-year pre-tax profits of £74.3m and earnings per share of 16.3p for 2012.

  Rattled investors in 3i Group will be keen to hear what management of the UK's largest listed private equity group 
will propose for future dividends when it reports its half-year results, writes Daniel Schäfer .
The asset manager's share price has declined by more than 40 per cent this year and some investors have called 
for a much higher pay-out from the group, which had net debt of £343m at the end of August.
Shareholder anger over the group's performance erupted again last week when Laxey Partners, an activist investor, 
called for a disposal of 3i's listed infrastructure arm and a subsequent pay-out of the proceeds to shareholders.
However, analysts say this proposal is unlikely to gain traction among other investors, since the infrastructure 
business is reducing the cyclicality of 3i's returns.
Michael Queen, chief executive of 3i, is expected to announce a doubling of the dividend to a level of about £80m. 
The group will also report a decline in valuations of its portfolio companies, which has weighed on earnings in the 
first half of the year.

The main Dublin shares market dipped in to negative territory again after worrying comments from the German 
Chancellor Angela Merkel.
She said hardly any countries in the G20 have said they will participate in the euro zone bailout fund.
By 1.30pm, the ISEQ was down 2.01 points to 2,680.13. The comment eclipsed relief among investors that Greece 
had ditched controversial plans to hold a referendum on its bailout, which calmed fears of an imminent sovereign 
debt default. After a rollercoaster week, the index is on track to post a weekly loss of 3.4 percent, its first weekly 
loss in six weeks. Investors were also assessing U.S. monthly jobs data showing employment rose less than 
expected, while a drop in the jobless rate to a six-month low of 9.0 percent and revisions to prior months' job gains 
signalled improvement in the labour market. In Europe, data showed private sector activity in the euro zone shrank 
at its fastest pace in 28 months in October, pointing towards a new recession for the region. Switzerland is one of 
CRH's largest markets, estimated to represent around 15pc of group profits, split broadly evenly between Materials 
and Products and Distribution. Goodbody says it notes comments on pricing pressures made by Vicat and Geberit 
in results released this week. Vicat reported an increase of 4.2pc in its Swiss sales for the first nine months on a 
constant currency basis. This was down from 7.2pc in the first half. However, management notes that "mild 
competitive pressures" emerged around the border regions in both its cement and precast operations on the back 
of the strong Swiss franc. Shares in CRH rose 4c to E12.94. Ryanair reported October passenger statistics this 
week which showed growth of 4pc in the month to 7.27m passengers. Load factors were 100bps lower at 84pc. 
Previous guidance from Ryanair for the quarter is for a fall in passengers numbers of 2pc. However, as indicated 
previously, the main capacity withdrawals will take place in the coming months, with the company reiterating its plan 
to ground up to 80 aircraft for the winter. "While management has recently reiterated guidance of E400m net 
income, we remain comfortable with our E430m net income forecast and at this stage do not feel there is any need 
to move our numbers," said analyst, Colm Foley. Ryanair shares fell 8c to E3.44. In the UK, William Hill announced

this week that it had sold its 15 remaining retail shops in the Republic of Ireland market to Boylesports for E1.5m. 
The sale will complete in December and the disposal is expected to lead to an exceptional cost of £2m in 2011. The 
group states that it will continue to operate in Ireland through its Irish facing website williamhill.ie. Following the 
acquisition, Boylesports will have 176 shops in the Irish market, which compares to Paddy Power with 209 and 
Ladbrokes with 216. "We do not find it overly surprising that William Hill is exiting the Irish market. Over the past 3 
years the group has been significantly reducing the Irish retail estate through the closure of over 30 shops. Given 
the limited scale of its Irish estate and the difficult market conditions that have been evident for a few years, we 
believe the contribution from these shops was likely to be negative," said analyst Gavin Kelleher. Shares in Paddy

Highlight: Move would boost airline market value
Pensions deficit could hamper sale
Body
Aer Lingus said on Thursday that the Irish government and Ryanair should co-operate and sell their combined 55 
per cent shareholding in the Irish flagcarrier as a single package.
The company said a controlling stake in the airline would attract a better market valuation. It would also remove the 
uncertainty caused by Ryanair's 29.8 per cent shareholding in Aer Lingus.
"I think it is in the interests of the government and Ryanair to sell a majority stake as they could then ask for a 
control premium," Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, told the Financial Times.
Mr Mueller reiterated his view that the Irish low-cost carrier should sell its stake in Aer Lingus, saying it was 
"disturbing for our day-to-day business" and "limiting our strategic options".
He said he believed the combined 55 per cent shareholding could be sold to another airline or placed on the 
market. But he said it was unlikely this could occur before the first quarter of 2012 because of concerns about the 
pension deficit and the requirement for a final government decision on a sale.
The Irish government has said it is considering selling its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. Leo Varadkar, Ireland's 
transport minister, has said the government would not sell it for less than EUR1 a share, which would value the 
stake at EUR132.4m (£114.2m) and the airline at EUR529.6m. Ryanair has also signalled it is willing to sell its 
stake in Aer Lingus.
A potential stumbling block to any sale is an estimated EUR400m-EUR500m deficit in a pension scheme of which 
the company is a sponsoring employer. A new actuarial valuation of the scheme is due by December.
Aer Lingus urges rival and Dublin to sell stake Travel & leisure
Etihad, the fast-growing Middle Eastern airline, recently approached the Irish government to buy its 25 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus. But European Union foreign ownership rules would make it virtually impossible for Etihad - an 
airline based outside the EU - to take a controlling stake in Aer Lingus.
Mr Mueller said Aer Lingus was very critical of these regulations: "I can't simply understand why non-EU airlines 
can't own a majority stake. After all, you can't steal an airline."
Mr Mueller said he hoped any future new shareholder would not have a negative impact on Aer Lingus's multi-
partner strategy.
"If one airline was to take a majority share and cancel our partnerships with other airlines this could have a negative 
impact on our share value," he said.
Aer Lingus reported on Thursday a 19.4 per cent increase in operating profit to EUR94.6m for the third quarter, up 
from EUR79.2m a year ago. It said it expected to report a full-year operating profit towards the upper end of analyst 
expectations, despite warning that it would face higher fuel and airport costs in the fourth quarter. Bloxham 
stockbrokers said it expected Aer Lingus to report full-year earnings before interest and tax of about EUR42m.
Aer Lingus has submitted an offer to purchase a package of slots at Heathrow airport from BMI British Midland. The 
airline already has 26 daily slot pairs there.
Aer Lingus will hold an extraordinary meeting on Friday, where it will ask shareholders to give it more flexibility to 
pay dividends in the future.

MONARCH MAKES A SOFT LANDING AFTER £45M LOSS Monarch Airlines has slumped to a £45m loss

Body
Aer Lingus expects to post full-year operating profit at the upper end of market forecasts but has warned its fourth 
quarter will be weaker than last year due to high fuel and airport charges.
The airline has posted an operating profit of 94.5m euros in the three months through September, up 14 pc on a 
year ago, as cost cutting and ancillary sales balanced increased costs.
Analysts had forecast a full-year operating profit of 36.7m euros after the airline posted a first-half operating loss of 
27.8m euros.
Aer Lingus shares have fallen 37 pc since the start of the year compared with a fall of 8 percent in the broader Irish 
market, due in part to concern about its large pension obligations. Rival Ryanair , which has a lower cost base and 
less exposure to the Irish market, has lost 12 pc. Aer Lingus said in its statement there had been no developments 
in talks over the pension deficit. Passenger numbers were up 2.1 pc in the third quarter compared with a year ago, 
while yields - the keenly watched measure showing average revenue gained per mile per passenger - were up 4 pc. 
Retail sales to passengers were up 6.1 pc. Aer Lingus has 47 pc of its 2012 fuel needs hedged at USD 975 per 
tonne and 84 pc of its fourth-quarter needs hedged at USD 921, the statement said.

Shares have recovered from a major fright today to end their session with healthy gains.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares went with the global flow, starting the
day with a fall, but ending 2.5pc ahead tonight.
The day started badly, with markets absorbing the implications of the overnight dressing down that Greek PM 
George Papandreou was given by the "Merkozy" duo of French and German leaders. Their warning that any Greek 
referendum must be on the core issue of whether the country should keep or drop the euro stokes market dread of 
an untidy default. As the day went on, however, the news got more positive. The ECB cut its key interest rate by 
0.25pc to 1.25pc in an effort to stimulate economic growth. Comments from the US by Fed chairman Ben 
Bernanke, who tried to soothe market tensions by promising to do more if necessary to boost the US economy, also 
added to the bullish mood. And in Greece, the trading day ended with Papandreou striking a more conciliatory note. 
By the European close, markets across the continent had moved from early 1-2 pc losses to substantial gains. In 
London the FTSE 100 closed 1.25pc higher, with the Dax in Frankfurt ahead by 3.07pc and the CAC-40 in Paris up 
by 2.73pc. In Dublin the ISEQ index ended 65.28 points ahead at 2,675.27 CRH was up 70c to 1290 after two of its 
European rivals posted results ahead of expectations. Both HeidelbergCement and Geberit have revealed they are 
doing surprisingly well, which will help raise hopes for their Irish counterpart. Aer Lingus ended 5c higher at 72 after 
reporting Q3 interim results yesterday morning that showing a big rise in Q3 operating profit. The rise was 
"modestly ahead of our recently upwardly revised estimate for the quarter", said Goodbody analyst Eamonn 
Hughes. Ryanair shares were also up, by 14c to 352. Kerry Group' had a less satisfactory, with its share prices 
falling for a second day on the back of its Q3 results this week. It shares ended 9c down on the day at 2,625. The 
falls have come despite the group's figures being broadly as expected. Other big names on the move were 
Kingspan, up 35c to 645, Elan ahead by 12c to 852, Smurift Kappa 13c higher at 475 and DCC down 30c to 1935. 
US stocks have also bounced in choppy trade following an industry report that showed the pace of growth in the

vast US services sector slowed modestly in October to its lowest level since June as new orders declined. A short 
time ago, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 164 points, or 1.38 percent, to 11,999. "It is a politics-driven 
market," said one Dublin trader. "With the violent intraday moves, the best way to play it is with very short-term, 
highly leveraged trackers or options, but with tight stop losses."

Shares have recovered from a major fright today to end their session with healthy gains.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares went with the global flow, starting the day with a fall, but ending 2.5pc ahead tonight.
The day started badly, with markets absorbing the implications of the overnight dressing down that Greek PM 
George Papandreou was given by the "Merkozy" duo of French and German leaders.
Their warning that any Greek referendum must be on the core issue of whether the country should keep or drop the 
euro stokes market dread of an untidy default. As the day went on, however, the news got more positive. The ECB 
cut its key interest rate by 0.25pc to 1.25pc in an effort to stimulate economic growth. Comments from the US by 
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, who tried to soothe market tensions by promising to do more if necessary to boost the 
US economy, also added to the bullish mood. And in Greece, the trading day ended with Papandreou striking a 
more conciliatory note. By the European close, markets across the continent had moved from early 1-2 pc losses to 
substantial gains. In London the FTSE 100 closed 1.25pc higher, with the Dax in Frankfurt ahead by 3.07pc and the 
CAC-40 in Paris up by 2.73pc. In Dublin the ISEQ index ended 65.28 points ahead at 2,675.27 CRH was up 70c to 
1290 after two of its European rivals posted results ahead of expectations. Both HeidelbergCement and Geberit 
have revealed they are doing surprisingly well, which will help raise hopes for their Irish counterpart. Aer Lingus 
ended 5c higher at 72 after reporting Q3 interim results yesterday morning that showing a big rise in Q3 operating 
profit. The rise was "modestly ahead of our recently upwardly revised estimate for the quarter", said Goodbody 
analyst Eamonn Hughes. Ryanair shares were also up, by 14c to 352. Kerry Group had a less satisfactory, with its 
share prices falling for a second day on the back of its Q3 results this week. It shares ended 9c down on the day at 
2,625. The falls have come despite the group's figures being broadly as expected. Other big names on the move 
were Kingspan, up 35c to 645, Elan ahead by 12c to 852, Smurift Kappa 13c higher at 475 and DCC down 30c to

Body
The ISEQ has regained some of the big losses it made earlier this week on Greece's shock referendum call after 
the ECB cut interest rates.
By 2pm the ISEQ had gained 56.16 points to 2,666.15.
The ECB cut its main interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent today as the euro zone's escalating debt crisis 
eclipsed worries over persistently high inflation.
"It's something that they should have done two months ago," said Philip Lawlor, investment strategist at Smith and 
Williamson. "My long held belief is that the ECB should be actively looking to drive financial conditions down 
through a combination of interest rates, fx and bond yield ... A 25-basis point cut is useful but I suspect it's still a 
case of too little too late, not aggressive enough. Why not do 50 basis points?" Greece's government seemed to be 
on the brink of collapse today, fuelling investor hopes that Prime Minister George Papandreou's planned vote on 
the rescue package would be abandoned and the package could be quickly activated. CRH's European rivals have 
posted results. Both HeidelbergCement and Geberit issued Q3 results that are ahead of consensus on the back of 
easing margin pressures. Furthermore, guidance is reiterated for the full year. HeidelbergCement has reported Q3 
EBITDA (core profits) of E778m, broadly flat year on year (yoy) and 3pc ahead of Bloomberg consensus. The 
outturn reflects easing margin pressures (down 140bps versus -180bps in Q2) on like for like (lfl) sales growth of 
10pc. At a regional level, lfl sales growth was strong in North America at +8pc (0pc in Q2) due to particular strength 
in the southern region, while lfl sales growth was steady in Western Europe at 7pc (7pc in Q2). The latter is on the 
back of continued strength in Germany and Scandinavia. Poland was also noted as an area of strength in its 
Eastern Europe region which reported lfl of 15pc in Q3, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers. Shares in CRH rose 
62c to E12.82. Aer Lingus has reported Q3 interim results showing an operating profit of E94.6m, up 19pc yoy. 
"This figure is modestly ahead of our recently upwardly revised estimate for the quarter and updated operating profit

guidance this morning gives us comfort on our near top of the range estimates for the full year," said Goodbody's 
Eamonn Hughes. Shares in the airline rose 3c to E0.70 while Ryanair gained 8c to E3.46. Kerry Group's Q3 growth 
data were broadly as expected. Guidance for the full year was maintained at 8-12pc earnings per share growth 
(Goodbody +10pc). Lfl volume growth was slightly behind our implied H2 target, notably in Kerry Foods, where we 
reckon Q3 volume growth was 0.8pc, all of which is generated from the UK (Ireland still negative). Ingredients 
volumes remained robust, at +3.5pc in Q3. Within this, the Americas held up at the same level as Q2, the Asia 
Pacific region remained very strong but Europe's growth rate almost halved to 2pc. Volumes will benefit in Q4 and 
into FY12 from new product initiatives from some of Kerry Ingredients' customers, though Q4 this year will have a 
tough comp with FY10. Price increases were less than in H1, as expected and Kerry has noted that some sectors 
continue to be impacted by the cost inflation issue, Goodbody's said. Kerry's shares fell 43c to E25.92.

Shares in Aer Lingus are rising after the Irish airline unveiled a better-than-expected quarterly profit and projected a 
healthy operating profit for the full year.
Aer Lingus says its operating profit in the July-September quarter rose 14 percent to (EURO)94.5 million ($129.5 
million) versus the same quarter of 2010. Sales rose 5.9 percent to (EURO)436 million ($597 million).
Thursday's trading statement offers no net figures. It says full-year 2011 profits are expected to reach the upper 
limit of analysts' forecasts but does not specify a figure.
Aer Lingus shares rose 8 percent to (EURO)0.70 ($0.96).
Aer Lingus is locked in a head-to-head battle with industry heavyweight Ryanair on Irish short-haul routes. Ryanair 
also is Aer Lingus' largest shareholder.

Dublin shares have edged ahead uncertainty in early trade on a crucial day for the euro zone crisis.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was 13.98 points ahead a short time ago at 2,623.97, recovering from a 6 point drop 
shortly after this morning's opening.
Its uncertain progress reflects a similar lack of direction across Europe as markets fluctuate from 1-2pc down to 
0.5pc up.
The ECB holds its latest monthly meeting today, with little clarity on the markets as to whether it may move to ease 
rates. With the very future of the euro zone now in play, there is even less clarity about overall economic prospects 
in the euro zone and further afield. In Dublin, shares were mixed, with CRH up 10c to 1230, Smirfit Kapps ahead by 
5c to 467 and Ryanair 3c up at 341. DCC has slipped by 25c to 1940, Kerry Group is down 44c to 2590 and Grafton

airline.
Body
Air China has raised $135 million with a US Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) guaranteed bond. The airline will use the 
proceeds to re-finance an Ex-Im loan for one new Boeing 777-300ER which delivered in September. 
The bond has a tenor of 11.75 years and a 6.28 year average life. The coupon is 2.735%. BNP Paribas is sole 
bookrunner and structuring agent. BNP Paribas was also debt provider for the original Ex-Im loan, while Baker & 
McKenzie advised Air China.
The bond is being settled today. Pricing and placement were completed last week. A leasing vehicle set up for the 
bond, Purple Chen 2011 LLC, issued the notes on behalf of Air China.
Air China's bond is the first cross border capital markets issuance for a Chinese airline and the first US Ex-Im bond 
for any airline in the Asia-Pacific region. It is also the first Ex-Im bond issuance since the US Government's rating 
was cut to AA+ by Standard & Poor's in August.
Olivier Trauchessec, managing director, aviation finance, BNP Paribas, says Air China was not a difficult name to 
introduce to US investors since government backing already gives the Ex-Im bond product a strong brand.
Air China and BNP Paribas have been discussing the possibility of a capital markets take out option since the bank 
was first mandated to Ex-Im finance one 777-300ER for the Chinese carrier earlier this year, says Trauchessec. Air 
China chose to issue the bond now because margins are competitive in the capital markets compared to debt 
financing, he says.
The fact that a Chinese airline has tapped the US capital markets is an encouraging sign for China&s two other big 
state-owned carriers, China Southern and China Eastern, who have to finance about 40 new deliveries next year 
between them, at a time when bank liquidity has become more scarce and debt margins have risen dramatically.
Air China closes Ex-Im bond
While Chinese carriers have traditionally enjoyed support from Chinese banks, this alternative and potentially deep 
source of financing will expand their options.
Air China alone needs to finance 30 new deliveries next year. The airline has secured preliminary Ex-Im backing for 
all of its 2012 777-300ER deliveries.
This year has seen modest Ex-Im bond issuance with only two issuers; Air China, and Ryanair. Ryanair closed a 
&,¬156 million ($222 million) Ex-Im bond in July.
Aviation Capital Group closed the last dollar Ex-Im capital markets transaction in December 2010. The 
lessor's $238 million bond financed six 737-800s and had a coupon of 3.35%. Read more here.
Emirates opened the Ex-Im bond market in 2009, with a $413 million bond to finance three 777-300ERs. The deal 
won Airfinance Journal&s overall deal of the year award for 2009.
Since then 23 Ex-Im bonds worth more than $3 billion have been issued by Emirates, Gol, Lan, Gecas, ACG, 
Ryanair and DAE.

BA wants pilots from various backgrounds
British Airways is aiming to recruit 800 new flight crew by 2016
British Airways changed its pilot-recruitment strategy this year after it foresaw a potential shortage of flight crew to 
replace retiring staff as it seeks to ensure sufficient capacity for its growing fleet.
In August, the UK carrier launched its biggest pilot-recruitment programme in more than a decade to put about 800 
new staff on the flight decks by 2016. While it needs about 100 new pilots a year to maintain its roughly 3,200-
strong cockpit workforce, the company aims to recruit around 150 flight crew members a year. Half these 
employees should come via direct entry from other airlines and the military, while the other half will be career 
starters who will require ab initio flight training before they can take off "on the line".
In recent years, BA's new pilots have included qualified career starters who financed their own training, but it did not 
recruit applicants from ab initio level. "We did not have the need for large numbers," says Captain Robin Glover, 
BA's head of pilot recruitment.
Until 2001, the airline sponsored the flight training of young people who had showed the required profile in aptitude 
tests and interviews. BA contracted external flight academies and paid professional fees for its future flight crew. 
This model changed as flying colleges started to increasingly train self-funded students, who arranged bank loans 
that allowed them to start repayments after securing a job. This became predominant as airlines such as EasyJet 
and Ryanair expanded rapidly, requiring many new pilots. Things changed again with the financial crisis in 2008, as 
banks became less keen to provide unsecured funds. This made it hard for talented people from poorer 
backgrounds to start flight training and, conversely, reduced the candidate pools for people who could arrange 
funding of about $160,000 for the training.
The right STUFFThe right mix British Airways is taking on more flight crew and re-introducing an ab initio 
training scheme to ensure sufficient manpower to keep....
training funds
"One year ago, we realised that unless we did something with the banks it was likely that there were not going to be 
many people who could afford to present themselves to the colleges with the funds to train," says Glover.
BA's ab initio pilot trainees must still secure their funding but the airline will guarantee their loans. "The fundamental 
difference is that we help the individual secure the finance we lowered the barrier," says Glover. "Anyone who has 
the ability, regardless of background or financial circumstances, can now have the funds made available to them."
The trick for BA is it does not need to pay a penny towards the training, unless the cadet fails to get a job or drops 
out of training. However, applicants have to go through the aptitude tests and interviews to be selected for the 
scheme so the risk that the airline is left to pick up the tab is low.
training syllabus
Successful applicants will be taught at CTC Aviation Training, Oxford Aviation or Flight Training Europe, which is 
based in Jerez, Spain. They will go through the European Aviation Safety Agency-mandated training syllabus via 
the private pilots licence (PPL) for the basic flying skills, multi-engine rating, instrument rating, commercial pilots 
licence and all airline transport pilots licence (ATPL) exams to gain a "frozen" ATPL.
This becomes active when the person has gained sufficient flight hours as a first officer on short-haul operations. 
Long-haul pilots must have a full ATPL. EASA-mandated minimum total flight time must be at least 1,500 flight-
hours. However, airline internal guidelines may vary. As BA flight crew log about 700 flight-hours a year, 
"unfreezing" the ATPL typically takes around two years.
Training to ATPL level is not unique to BA as colleges instruct cadets who may go on to work for other airlines. The 
jet-orientation course near the end of the formal training programme may involve BA checklists and procedures but 
the airline refuses to interfere with colleges or curriculums. "What we will absolutely do is to provide feedback where 
we see strengths and weaknesses in the overall training standard," says Glover. This will be assessed when the 
trainee pilots finally gain their type rating, most likely for Airbus A320-family aircraft, and adopt BA's standard 
operating procedures (SOP) at its Cranebank simulator centre at Heathrow.
The conversion course is also where direct-entry pilots begin their service with the airline. Given that BA's short-
haul fleet is almost exclusively based on A320-family aircraft, having flight time on the European narrowbody is 
obviously an advantage.
Formally, direct-entry applicants must have at least 500 flight-hours on heavy jets. If they already have the required 
type rating, they can go on a zero flight-time course to adopt BA's SOP and then go straight into line operations with 
a training captain for the initial period. Naturally, military fast-jet pilots will not have the required "heavy" experience 
and will have to join their peers at the type rating level, which requires theoretical classes, simulator instruction and 
base training to practise takeoffs and landings on the actual aircraft before they can join line operations.
High-quality flying skills are crucial but not the lone criteria. "There are many technically outstanding pilots who find 
themselves not being successful in our interviews because they are not the type of pilots that we are necessarily 
looking for," says Glover. He says soft skills such as leader leadership qualities, good communication skills, 
emotional resilience and empathy to form effective working relationships with the cockpit and cabin crew are equally 
important.
TECHNICAL SKILLS
Glover says BA takes time over interviews to ensure the individual has the "right motivation" and fits the required 
profile. "There are no right answers. We need to see passion, credibility and people who are able to look beyond 
just the technical skills set," says Glover. "We are not looking for anybody to be exceptional in the intellectual sense 
or in the people/feeling sense. We are looking for a balance between the two."
The right STUFFThe right mix British Airways is taking on more flight crew and re-introducing an ab initio 
training scheme to ensure sufficient manpower to keep....
Good team-working skills are a central part in crew-resource management-training for modern flight decks. While 
pilots must fly manoeuvres accurately and to a high standard, they also need to be aware of human limitations, how 
to track and manage errors as well as to project their situational awareness forward to anticipate and deal with 
potential issues before they make become acute, says Glover. "When complicated situations are trained in the 
simulator, we are looking at how people manage the situation better, how they could have more information from 
each other and the system, and perhaps how they could improve the decision they have made."
Rather than taking on mainly career starters, who can be moulded according to the airline's training philosophy from 
an early stage, BA wants to take on fresh flying cadets and seasoned pilots from a variety of backgrounds. "We find 
they bring us fabulous experience," says Glover. The airline is equally keen on recruiting flight crew from the 
commercial field and, albeit in a smaller volume, from the military arena. "With that three-channel approach, we get 
the right mix, right experience and, crucially, right quality," he says.

Good team-working skills are equally as important to BA as the ability to fly manoeuvres well

The main Dublin shares index rose this morning as the markets await tonight's euro debt summit with hopes of a 
robust plan to end the lingering certainty.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 12.64 points to 2,667.42.
Financial markets were gripped on Wednesday by a European Union summit pledged to tackle the euro zone's debt 
crisis but struggling to come up with firm commitments.
Wall Street looked set to open higher, helping lift European stock out of a tight trading range. Market expectations 
that EU leaders will come up with a comprehensive solution to the debt problem have dipped as political wrangling 
ahead of the meeting has continued. Investment bank Citi said it was a "numbers game, without the numbers". Bill 
Blain at Newedge said in a note there was "a scary calm across markets". While there appears to be broad 
consensus on the need for around 110 billion euros to be injected into the European banking system to help it 
withstand a potential Greek debt default and wider financial contagion, there is little clarity on two other critical parts 
of the package. Those are how to scale up the region's rescue fund and how much of a loss private bondholders 
will take on Greek debt. "They can't quite pull the rabbit out of the hat yet, though they will probably get something 
better over time," said Lothar Mentel, chief investment officer at Octopus Investments. He suggested markets would 
react badly to any failure to come up with a plan, but there was no early sign of that. Ryanair reports its quarter (Q2) 
with the highest weighting of profitability on November 7th. Davy assume net profit of E383.1m on revenues of 
E1,498m or 25.6pc net margins, broadly flat on last year. This compares with our full-year forecasts of net income 
of E410.3m (consensus net income is running at c.E396m for Q2 and E421m for the full year). Recent 
announcements include new bases at Manchester, Wroclaw (Poland) and Baden-Baden (Germany), bringing the 
total number to 47. Fuel hedging has been added in the quarter; the airline is 57pc hedged at dollar 999 per metric 
tonne for FY 2013. Capacity growth has been running at 6pc off flat loads of 87.7pc in the quarter, but the key will

be yields - we assume 13.5pc (Q2 yield guidance: 12-15pc). We also assume 6pc growth in ancillaries, ex-fuel unit 
costs up 8pc and fuel unit costs up 15pc. Shares in Ryanair rose 5c to E3.29. Shares in United Drug rose 2c to 
E2.22. Celesio the pan-European wholesaler/pharmacy operator is now guiding "at least E575m" of EBITDA for the 
full year, compared to "around E600m" previously. Regulatory interventions in the UK and fiercer competition in 
France and Germany are cited as reasons for this revision. The group is also launching an 'Operational Excellence' 
programme to stem declining earnings. This aims to achieve savings of some E50m a year and will focus on 
reducing fixed costs, reducing losses in the pharmacy set-up in Sweden and halting projects with start-up losses.

The main Dublin shares index rose this morning as the markets await tonight's euro debt summit with hopes of a 
robust plan to end the lingering certainty.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 12.64 points to 2,667.42.
Financial markets were gripped on Wednesday by a European Union summit pledged to tackle the euro zone's debt 
crisis but struggling to come up with firm commitments.
Wall Street looked set to open higher, helping lift European stock out of a tight trading range. Market expectations 
that EU leaders will come up with a comprehensive solution to the debt problem have dipped as political wrangling 
ahead of the meeting has continued. Investment bank Citi said it was a "numbers game, without the numbers". Bill 
Blain at Newedge said in a note there was "a scary calm across markets". While there appears to be broad 
consensus on the need for around 110 billion euros to be injected into the European banking system to help it 
withstand a potential Greek debt default and wider financial contagion, there is little clarity on two other critical parts 
of the package. Those are how to scale up the region's rescue fund and how much of a loss private bondholders 
will take on Greek debt. "They can't quite pull the rabbit out of the hat yet, though they will probably get something 
better over time," said Lothar Mentel, chief investment officer at Octopus Investments. He suggested markets would 
react badly to any failure to come up with a plan, but there was no early sign of that. Ryanair reports its quarter (Q2)

Independent News and Media has appointed James Osborne as its chairman after the retirement of Brian Hillery.
Osborne, a 61-year-old director at the budget airline Ryanair, replaces Hillery with immediate effect.
Hillery announced his retirement from INM in November after seven years as chairman.
He said after the new chairman was announced that Osborne's appointment marked a "new chapter" for Ireland's 
largest media group, which has faced renewed tensions between its chief executive Gavin O'Reilly and major 
shareholder Denis O'Brien. "I am delighted that the board has approved James Osborne's appointment. He brings a 
wealth of experience and skill to the board," he said. "I have served on the board for eight years and have greatly 
appreciated the support of shareholders. I have had the privilege to work alongside excellent directors and 
management. "After some recent challenging years for the company I am happy that this appointment marks the 
beginning of a new chapter in its history and I wish James well in his new role." Osborne praised Hillery's tenure as 
chairman, and said the company is "leaner, more focused and better positioned for future growth". Osborne has 
served on Ryanair's board of directors for 15 years and is a former managing partner of the solicitors firm A and L 
Goodbody. According to a profile page on the Ryanair website, Osborne currently serves as a director of a number 
of Irish private companies. Hostilities resurfaced at INM in July this year after O'Brien said the company had 
"suffered gravely" and that Hillery was not an independent chairman because of his strong business relationship 
with the O'Reilly family.

largest media group, which has faced renewed tensions between its chief executive Gavin O'Reilly and major 
shareholder Denis O'Brien. "I am delighted that the board has approved James Osborne's appointment. He brings a 
wealth of experience and skill to the board," he said. "I have served on the board for eight years and have greatly 
appreciated the support of shareholders. I have had the privilege to work alongside excellent directors and 
management. "After some recent challenging years for the company I am happy that this appointment marks the 
beginning of a new chapter in its history and I wish James well in his new role." Osborne praised Hillery's tenure as 
chairman, and said the company is "leaner, more focused and better positioned for future growth". Osborne has 
served on Ryanair's board of directors for 15 years and is a former managing partner of the solicitors firm A and L 
Goodbody. According to a profile page on the Ryanair website, Osborne currently serves as a director of a number 
of Irish private companies. Hostilities resurfaced at INM in July this year after O'Brien said the company had 
"suffered gravely" and that Hillery was not an independent chairman because of his strong business relationship 
with the O'Reilly family.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has unveiled plans to double the size of the airline.
Talking to the Financial Times, Mr O'Leary said he wanted to increase passenger numbers from 72m to 120-130m 
over the next decade.
The company is also looking to buy up to 300 new aircraft, despite the economic uncertainty, he said.
The company is talking to Russian and Chinese manufacturers, as well as Boeing, about the deal. If implemented 
the expansion would make Ryanair one of the biggest airlines in the world. Mr O'Leary said that troubles in the 
eurozone could help it to increase its market share by boosting demand for low-cost travel. All of Ryanair's current 
fleet of 270 planes are manufactured by US plane maker Boeing. However, Mr O'Leary suggested he was now 
talking to other manufacturers, including China's Comac and Russia's Irkut, about a deal to buy new aircraft.

O'Leary gets infantile
Like fans of Millwall football club - who famously chant "No one likes us, we don't care" - Michael O'Leary is 
probably so not bothered at Ryanair being voted worst airline in a poll of UK travellers, with rival British Airways 
named favourite.
O'Leary's philosophy has always been that Ryanair is a business, not a public service, and that - despite the 
barrage of unpleasantries he throws at passengers, from the fight for seats at boarding to luggage fees and 
possible single-lav 737s - the Irish carrier's low fares and connections to the far-flung parts of Europe other airlines 
don't reach ensure its flights rarely have empty seats.
His latest response to someone asking how to avoid Ryanair's new infant fees - "don't bring your infants" - lumped 
babies with bags.
How long until fat fees, with scales for all at check-in? A matter of time, we reckon.
iPlod
We enjoyed this caustic comment about the 787 from one "Layman" on the Vero Venia blog (except for its 
depressing assumption that being born 47 years ago makes you an elderly technophobe).
"Putting new engines on such an old design is like handing an iPad to your granny. It may give her the semblance 
of being up to date, but you cannot disguise the fact that she was born at the time of the Beatles in 1964."
Apple juice
The chairman of the NBAA 'iPads in Cockpit' session (standing-room-only in the biggest seminar room at the Las 
Vegas Convention Center) closed with: "Any function you'd like the iPad to perform that it doesn't?"
From the floor a lone pilot voice: "Serve drinks."

The centre's manager Tim Wallis says visitors will be able to discuss the restoration with the experts.

constantly impressed by the innovation and workmanship that the original build represented," he says.

Highlight: Budget carrier looks to buy up to 300 aircraft
Plans for large increase in passenger numbers
Body
Ryanair has ambitious plans to increase the number of passengers flying with Europe's leading low-cost airline 
each year from 70m to up to 130m over the next decade, by buying as many as 300 aircraft.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times he was looking to take a large delivery of 
aircraft between 2015 and 2021, and was in talks with US, Chinese and Russian manufacturers.
His comments are his most explicit yet about taking the Irish airline on a second phase of growth following rapid 
expansion over the past decade.
Mr O'Leary insisted he would only buy aircraft at "cheap prices", but one analyst questioned whether Ryanair could 
strike a cut-price deal with Boeing or Airbus, the established commercial aircraft makers. Another analyst said 
further expansion could hurt profitability at the airline.
Ryanair has an all-Boeing fleet, and Mr O'Leary acknowledged it would face increased operating costs if it bought 
aircraft from a different manufacturer.
Ryanair is talking to three manufacturers - Boeing of the US, China's Comac and Russia's Irkut - about a deal to 
buy 200-300 narrow-body aircraft.
Such a deal could enlarge Ryanair's fleet from 300 to 500 and enable the airline to increase passenger numbers. "I 
would like to grow to 120m, 130m passengers," said Mr O'Leary. In 2010-11, 72.1m passengers flew with Ryanair.
At 130m passengers, Ryanair would consolidate its position as one of the world's largest airlines. Lufthansa, 
Europe's largest airline by revenue, flew 91m passengers in 2010. Southwest Airlines, the US low-cost carrier, flew 
88m passengers in 2010.
Ryanair eyes new growth phase
Mr O'Leary said demand for low-cost air travel in the deteriorating economic environment meant Ryanair could 
continue to increase market share on European short-haul routes.
Ryanair's expansion in recent years has focused on Italy and Spain, and Mr O'Leary said the airline now had big 
growth opportunities in Scandinavia and eastern Europe.
He outlined the case for deploying 50 aircraft in Scandinavia and 100 in eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.
Mr O'Leary added that Ryanair could pay two more special dividends before it placed a new aircraft order.
Ryanair paid a maiden dividend worth EUR500m ($692m) last year, and is considering a similar payment in 2012-
13.
Mr O'Leary said a third special dividend might be possible in 2014-15 if Ryanair had not finalised an aircraft order 
by then, but he ruled out an annual pay-out to shareholders.

Highlight: Interview
Michael O'Leary
Ryanair chief executive
Budget airline is eyeing Russian and Chinese options, says Andrew Parker
Body
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has a big decision to make.
After a decade of ferocious growth at the low-cost airline, Ryanair's fleet will peak at 300 next year when Boeing 
supplies the last aircraft due under a 2005 contract.
The question for Mr O'Leary is what to do next - expand Ryanair once again by purchasing more aircraft, or 
concentrate on generating cash and handing it back to shareholders. A second issue hanging over Ryanair is 
whether it can realistically retain its ultra-lean cost structure over the long term.
Mr O'Leary - a self-confessed "loud mouth" - is clear about the case for buying new aircraft: "Staying as is for the 
next 10 to 20 years sounds a bit too much like just lethargy ... we're not going to stop here," he says.
Ryanair is therefore in "talks" with three manufacturers - Boeing of the US, China's Comac and Russia's Irkut - 
about the possibility of buying between 200 and 300 narrow-body aircraft from one of them. Mr O'Leary has a tough 
reputation when it comes to negotiations. In 2002, he infuriated Airbus by signing a contract with Boeing for its 737-
800 aircraft after coming close to a deal with the European manufacturer. Relations between Ryanair and Airbus 
have never fully recovered.
He likes to highlight the discount he secured on that 2002 order, given that it was struck during the aviation crisis 
that followed the September 11 terror attacks, when aircraft makers were desperate for deals.
Ryanair chief looks for blue sky beyond Boeing contract
Mr O'Leary thinks he can get a good deal this time around because the manufacturers could again have orders 
cancelled amid the worsening economic climate.
Boeing and Airbus are also facing new competitors. To try to heap pressure on the established jet makers, Mr 
O'Leary says he is in serious negotiations with Comac and Irkut, which are both proposing to supply airlines with 
narrow-body aircraft from 2016.
However, Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners, says Boeing and Airbus have little incentive to strike a 
cut-price deal with Ryanair for new aircraft because they already have substantial orders for their narrow-body jets.
He adds that Ryanair could opt for the unknown quantity of buying aircraft from the Chinese or Russians, but those 
aircraft could well encounter significant delays in development. Meanwhile, although Ryanair may look a better 
investment than the European flag carriers in a weak economic situation, because more people want cheap air 
travel, some analysts say the company's profit margin could come under pressure.
Ryanair recorded a 13.5 per cent operating margin in 2010-11, compared with 4.5 per cent at Lufthansa in 2010, 
and 3.9 per cent at British Airways in the six months to June 30.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, says that more expansion by Ryanair could reduce its profitability 
because opening new European short-haul routes often involves discounted fares.
He adds that Ryanair investors will want reassurances that renewed expansion is not accompanied by weaker 
operating margins.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, highlights other long term risks for Ryanair, including the possibility of higher 
airport user charges and unionisation of the company's workforce.
Mr O'Leary has no issue with employees joining trade unions, but says collective bargaining could mean pay cuts. 
And he insists he can extract favourable user charges with airports that are keen to secure more travellers, 
particularly in uncertain economic times.
The Ryanair chief executive's energy is undiminished after 17 years in the top job.
Mr O'Leary says he will retire in two to three years, but acknowledges he has been saying that for a long time.

Shares in Dublin rose gingerly this morning on hopes that the EU is approaching a wide ranging deal on the euro 
crisis.
Government leaders meeting yesterday edged closer to an agreement on how to shore up banks, but remained at 
odds on details of a Greek default and measures to prevent default contagion elsewhere in the euro zone.
The gains in Dublin reflected modest advances on other markets across Euroe.
The ISEQ index was up 15.10 points a short time ago at 2,644.66. Most major shares were ahead, with CRH 
gaining 11c to 1351, DCC rising 15c to 1948 and Ryanair lifting by 5c to 326. Elan was up 4c to 800 and Glanbia

story], I'm not employed by Denis O'Brien, so I'm free to talk about it."
Smyth let her and another guest, Nick Webb of the Irish Independent, ruminate for a while about O'Brien's 
controversial appearance at the recent Farmleigh forum, but then closed it off ''before somebody comes down, runs 
into the studio and pulls a wire''.
Over on Newstalk - another O'Brien owned station - Eamon Dunphy was laying into the mogul on The Dunphy 
Show (Newstalk 106-108). Simultaneously, Smyth was pretending to give a toss about the burning issue of Ryanair 
supposedly turning down a shirt-sponsorship opportunity with Manchester United last year.
Smyth's replacement as presenter is Anton Savage, a public relations person who sometimes stands in for Matt 
Cooper on The Last Word. Those who remember the role that Smyth played in the 2005 closure of Chuck Feeney's 
Centre for Public Inquiry, happily publishing unproven allegations about investigative reporter Frank Connolly that 
had been leaked to him by Michael McDowell, might justifiably accuse Smyth as having acted as something of a PR 
conduit himself on that particular occasion. A penny for Connolly's thoughts last weekend.
Whatever you say, Sam, say nothing
* Documentary On One: From A Jack To A King (RTE Radio 1) was an enjoyable interview - a monologue, really - 
with Mark Leen, an Elvis impersonator from Tralee. The jailing of his father for republican activities when Leen was 
aged nine was the unlikely spur for him becoming interested in the King, though he went on to have his (rhinestone) 
collar felt plenty of times in subsequent years for minor stuff.
At his first gig, Leen fashioned a pair of sideburns out of melted chocolate. His collection of Elvisiana has come on a 
bit since then, including a suit that Presley wore when coming home to Memphis. A nice programme, though it 
made me wonder, not for the first time, why almost all Elvis impersonators model themselves on the sweaty, 
jumpsuited, late-period King and not the young, thrusting, leather-trousered version.
* All taoisigh end up having their own personal interview of infamy, the one where they screw the occasion up so 
badly that their knee ends up following their foot into their mouth. Both knees, if they're really on form.
Charles Haughey once fantasised aloud about slitting the throats of opponents and shoving them over a clifftop. 
Albert Reynolds revealed on Morning Ireland in 1992 that he hoped to ''dehumanise the social welfare system''. 
John Bruton screamed at a reporter that he was sick of talking about the fucking peace process. Brian Cowen . . . 
let's draw a dignified veil over that one.
Bertie Ahern's equivalent moment has arrived more than three years after he left office. In a 45-minute conversation 
with two students from DCUfm, he left behind many, many landmines. Two are especially worth repeating. First, 
having spent the last three years complaining that nobody ever told him anything about what was unfolding, he said 
here: ''They gave us a whole lot of warnings. In fairness, the Department of Finance give you warnings about 
everything."
So which was it? No warnings, or lots of warnings?
Ahern had a similarly interesting take on the property boom's failure to get boomier: ''We ended up building half a 
million houses; I mean, if we didn't build half a million houses, people would have ended up living on the side of the 
bloody street."
It's a sentence that reads like a Spot The Deliberate Mistake competition, but Ahern appeared to be deadly serious. 
A pity that the moment has now passed for a cheeky tilt at the Aras.

Aer Lingus has criticised Ryanair's attempts to call an extraordinary general meeting of Aer Lingus shareholders.
It has added that its rival's 29 pc stake in the airline should not be maintained in the long run.
The two airlines have been locked in a bitter war of words for months over Aer Lingus' large pension deficit and the 
absence of a dividend payment by Aer Lingus.
"We believe that the context in which you frame your proposals is a continuing attempt to de-focus and distract 
management with consequent potential implications for performance and, as such, are not in the best interests of all 
shareholders," Aer Lingus Chairman Colin Barrington has said in a letter to Ryanair Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary. Ryanair has twice had attempts to take over Aer Lingus rebuffed on competition grounds and Barrington 
said Ryanair should sell its stake, which is valued at around 113m euros. "It is our view that the shareholding 
cannot be maintained in the long term," he said. Ryanair has said it would consider selling its stake if the 
government sells its 25 pc shareholding. The government is considering putting its shares on the block as part of an 
EU-IMF privatisation programme.

Shares in Dublin have taken a hit this morn ing from a renewed bout of pessimism about the chances of a

The ISEQ index was down 21.15 points a short time ago to 2,599.13.
The drop tracked losses across Europe after emergency talks last night between France's Nicolas Sarkozy and 
Germany's Angela Merkel.
Sarkozy rushed to Frankfurt for the talks last night after saying that Franco-German efforts to solve the crisis were 
stalled. In Dublin this morning almost all share movements are down. CRH has dropped by 9c to 1335, Smurfit

Ryanair today said it has notified Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington that should he again fail to issue a 
satisfactory reply to his largest shareholder within 7 days, then Ryanair intends to requisition an EGM.
The meeting would, Ryanair said, allow them to discuss and express their views on the three initiatives proposed by 
Ryanair.
The initiatives include, ending what Ryanair say is the cover up of the Deloitte/McCann Fitzgerald report into Aer 
Lingus's recent E30 million "leave and rehire" Revenue penalty, a proposed one off dividend of E0.20 per share 
payable in 2011 from Aer Lingus' cash reserves of over E900 millon.
In addition, the company plans to end what it says is Aer Lingus' continuing failure to confirm that it will not make 
any additional payments to Aer Lingus' defined contribution pension schemes without prior shareholder approval. 
"We regret Mr Barrington's continuing failure to reply to our letters, while he presides over a share price which has 
collapsed from over E3 to under E0.70 in recent weeks. Given that recent analyst coverage of Aer Lingus has 
clearly signalled that a dividend and/or an end to the uncertainty over additional payments to the company's defined 
contribution pension schemes, would lead to a substantial rerating of Aer Lingus' shares, Aer Lingus' continuing 
failure to reply to Ryanair's proposals is unacceptable," the Ryanair statement said. "If Mr Barrington continues to 
ignore a 29pc shareholder, then we will be left with no alternative other than to requisition an EGM (which any 
shareholder holding more than 10pc is legally entitled to call) to see whether there is a majority of Aer Lingus 
shareholders who support Ryanair's view that these proposals should be implemented in the interests of improving 
shareholder value, and reversing the catastrophic collapse in Aer Lingus' share price which Mr Barrington and his 
Board have presided over in recent years."

The main Dublin shares index made strong early gains this morning on the prospect of a sustainable plan coming 
from EU leaders to tackle the debt crisis but statements from a German minister have cast doubts on what will 
actually emerge.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 6.10 points to 2,610.72.
Share markets lost early highs today after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said a forthcoming 
European Union summit would not yield a definitive solution to the region's debt crisis. The comments dented 
optimism after the weekend's G20 summit that EU leaders would decisively address the region's problems On Oct. 
23. A volatile week in financial markets now seems certain as the negotiations continue up to the Eurogroup summit 
on Sunday, October 23rd. New plans were presented at the G20 meeting of finance ministers in Paris over the 
weekend. The three key issues to be resolved by Sunday are the extent of private sector involvement in a 
restructuring of Greek debt, how to construct a firewall around Greece to contain spillovers into European debt 
markets and the agreement of a plan to recapitalise European banks.
Reports say that Etihad has approached the Irish government to buy its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus. Etihad has also 
been linked with Virgin Atlantic regarding the sale of BMI. Under ownership rules, there would be nothing to stop 
Etihad buying minority stakes in European airlines, but it would be prevented from buying majority stakes. For Aer 
Lingus, a resolution of the multi-employer pension deficit will be needed, but certainly Aer Lingus (like TAP and

The main Dublin shares index made strong early gains this morning on the prospect of a sustainable plan coming 
from EU leaders to tackle the debt crisis but statements from a German minister have cast doubts on what will 
actually emerge.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 6.10 points to 2,610.72.
Share markets lost early highs today after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said a forthcoming 
European Union summit would not yield a definitive solution to the region's debt crisis. The comments dented 
optimism after the weekend's G20 summit that EU leaders would decisively address the region's problems On Oct. 
23. A volatile week in financial markets now seems certain as the negotiations continue up to the Eurogroup summit 
on Sunday, October 23rd. New plans were presented at the G20 meeting of finance ministers in Paris over the 
weekend. The three key issues to be resolved by Sunday are the extent of private sector involvement in a 
restructuring of Greek debt, how to construct a firewall around Greece to contain spillovers into European debt 
markets and the agreement of a plan to recapitalise European banks.
Reports say that Etihad has approached the Irish government to buy its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus. Etihad has also 
been linked with Virgin Atlantic regarding the sale of BMI. Under ownership rules, there would be nothing to stop 
Etihad buying minority stakes in European airlines, but it would be prevented from buying majority stakes. For Aer 
Lingus, a resolution of the multi-employer pension deficit will be needed, but certainly Aer Lingus (like TAP and 
BMI) could find itself the focus of consolidation in 2012. Presumably, there is some attraction with the feeding of

Etihad in talks to buy Dublin's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus

Body
Etihad, the fast-growing Middle Eastern airline, has approached the Irish government to buy its 25 per cent stake in 
flag-carrier Aer Lingus, according to people with knowledge of the move.
The approach comes after the debt-laden Irish sovereign said in September it would sell its stake in the national 
carrier. Leo Varadkar, Ireland's transport minister, said that he would not sell it for less than EUR1 per share, which 
would value the stake at EUR132.4m (£116m) and the airline at EUR529.6m.
Aer Lingus shares closed at EUR0.64 on Friday, valuing it at EUR338.94m and the government stake at 
EUR84.7m.
It is unclear how far talks have progressed and they might not result in any deal. Etihad and the Irish government 
declined to comment. Analysts believe that the most likely buyer of the airline is International Airlines Group, the 
parent company of British Airways.
Last week James Hogan, Etihad chief executive, met Enda Kenny, Irish prime minister, at an investment event in 
Dublin, the global Irish Economic Forum. Mr Hogan announced 100 new jobs for cabin crew based in Ireland.
Etihad has been in talks with Virgin Atlantic on a possible partnership should the UK carrier bid for BMI, the 
lossmaking subsidiary of Lufthansa, say people familiar with the talks.
IAG, the holding company of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, has tabled a preliminary offer for BMI, which holds 
valuable take-off and landing slots at Heathrow airport. Etihad is interested in the possibility of tapping BMI's short 
and medium-haul network   for its own long-haul routes.
An Irish government report in June recommended selling the national airline along with ports and power stations as 
part of plans to raise EUR5bn to repair Ireland's accounts. One potential stumbling block to the sale of the Aer 
Lingus stake is the large deficit in a pension scheme of which the company is a sponsoring employer. The deficit 
was estimated to be EUR400m last year, and a new actuarial valuation is due by December.

Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, has said he welcomed a possible ownership change at the company.
Ryanair ruled itself out of a bid, having failed twice to take it over because of objections by the Irish government and 
European competition authorities.

A E9 million tourism marketing blitz involving significant matching private sector funding to boost visitor numbers to 
Ireland was announced today by Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Leo Varadkar.
Tourism Ireland's funding for the campaigns is supported by revenues from the air travel tax, while matching 
funding is being provided by partner companies including Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann, overseas airlines 
including Emirates, Etihad, US Airways, online travel agents, Irish Ferries, Stena and other ferry companies.
A series of joint co-operative marketing campaigns between Tourism Ireland and private operators will promote 
Ireland to around 20 million potential overseas visitors over the coming months. The 'Home of Champions' 
campaign will also be extended to promote golfing holidays in Ireland, on the back of Irish major golf winners.
Minister Varadkar said these measures will build on the Jobs Initiative launched earlier this year, which focused on 
job creation in tourism. The campaigns aim to increase visitor numbers before the end of the year, and also prepare 
the ground for the proposed year-long tourism initiative in 2013, The Gathering, showcased at the Global Irish 
Economic Forum. The key partners include the following: Ryanair, Aer Lingus, Aer Arann, Emirates, Etihad, FlyBE, 
Jet2, Virgin Atlantic, Norwegian Airlines, Cheapflights, Irish Ferries, Stena Line, Celtic Link, Thomas Cook India, 
Cox & Kings, GZL China, Aer China Travel Beijing, Beijing UTour, Expedia, Travelocity, Opodo, eDreams, 
HostelBookers, Hotels.com, Cheapflights and Rumbo, the Irish Tour Operators Association, SuperBreaks (UK),

AS AN island nation, the ability to move people and goods effectively and quickly to and from our shores is of vital 
importance to British business". So says David Frost, former director-general of the British Chamber of Commerce, 
and he couldn't be more right. A culture that throws so many obstacles in the way of infrastructure investment has 
led to the UK facing an air capacity crunch that threatens its economic position.
Heathrow runs at 98 per cent capacity, with jets circulating for an accumulative 55 hours every day over London. It 
is estimated that the British economy is losing £1.2bn a year to Schiphol, Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt because 
our own airports in the southeast are unable to compete with increases in capacity taking place at other European 
hubs. Business fears that the UK will lose trade deals with emerging economies such as China if it does not do 
something about air capacity.
Unfortunately for our nation's economic wellbeing, we have put off a serious discussion about the inadequacies of 
our present airport provision for too long. We should have been confronting these strategic decisions years ago. 
Even radical solutions such as Boris Johnson's Estuary Airport could not be delivered in time to stop the slide 
against our competitors. "Boris Island", a planned multi-runway airport that would sit in the Thames Estuary, would 
take 25 years to deliver and cost £50bn to construct.
We need a solution that will at least help increase capacity in the medium term, so as to give us the breathing 
space to agree and enact a longer term answer, whether that be growing Gatwick or a completely new airport.
To keep the economy flying we need more air capacity: Heathwick is our best hope
Alternatives have been suggested: London Manston already has the longest runway in southern England, and with 
a high speed rail link to the Eurostar would have adequate accessibility. Other possibilities include Cliffe in Kent, 
and closer to Heathrow is Northolt, but that would require a re-alignment of the runway.
A possible solution that could be delivered with minimal disruption and at a realistic cost is the innovative idea of a 
virtual hub. The proposal would be the first of its kind, and has acquired the nickname Heathwick. This would 
require the construction of a high speed rail link that would connect Heathrow and Gatwick as one airport. The 
trains would travel at 180 miles per hour, making the journey time just 15 minutes. The link would travel mainly 
underground, hugging the route of the M25. The rail link would act as a transit between the two hubs. By linking the 
two airports in this way, short haul airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet would then be encouraged to move out to 
the regional alternatives such as Stansted and Luton. Stansted is presently under capacity, running at just 58 per 
cent. Gatwick would then become a feeder airport, with Heathrow as the long haul focus. Although no in-depth 
costing has been carried out on the Heathwick concept, initial estimates place the cost in the region of £5bn.
Heathwick is not without detractors. Willie Walsh of the International Airlines Group has already publicly rubbished 
the idea. He would prefer the revival of the third runway option at Heathrow. Delivering such a scheme is 
complicated further by the fact that the two airports are owned by different companies. However, politics is the art of 
the possible, and currently there appears little chance of the government reversing its decision on the third runway; 
and in the current economic climate there is not the appetite for an entirely new airport - although that may be the 
right long term solution. What might be possible is this proposed virtual hub, which doesn't involve knocking down 
villages or carving up marginal parliamentary constituencies. The other big plus is the time a transit link would take 
to build - such a project could be delivered within a decade. The timescale for delivery has to be the biggest selling 
point. We need to increase capacity now, any solution needs to be delivered quickly. With Heathrow out as an 
option, an estuary airport decades away from being realised, with other large infrastructure projects such as 
Crossrail and High Speed 2 absorbing public funds, a virtual hub is a realistic option. Linking the two airports as one 
will also leave open the future prospect of a second runway at Gatwick, which will see its planning moratorium on 
future expansion come to an end in 2019.
We need to tackle the air capacity crunch, and I will be using my role to encourage the Mayor, the government and 
other politicians to put aside sectional interest and do what is right for the economic future of London and the 
country: increase air capacity before we sink further behind Europe and the Far East.

But no immediate payment planned
Body
Aer Lingus has asked shareholders to approve technical adjustments to its balance sheet that would enable it to 
pay special dividends in future.
The Irish airline has not made any dividend payments to shareholders since it was floated in 2006. In recent 
months, Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, has repeatedly called on the company's board to 
return cash to shareholders. Management has so far rejected the calls, citing unstable economic conditions.
Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus chairman, wrote to shareholders on Wednesday requesting that they sanction the 
cancellation of up to EUR500m in non-distributable reserves, freeing the cash to potentially pay a dividend in future.
The airline has called an extraordinary meeting on November 4 to approve the changes.
Under Irish company law any dividends on ordinary shares must be funded from distributable reserves, regardless 
of whether the company has enough cash to pay them. This has limited Aer Lingus's ability to pay dividends due to 
the EUR210m of accumulated losses on its balance sheet built up during past periods of sustained losses.
Mr Barrington's letter to shareholders said the company was not thinking of an immediate dividend payment but 
wanted to increase future flexibility. At the end of June, Aer Lingus had EUR357m of net cash.
"The board is not currently contemplating the payment of a dividend to shareholders [or the redemption or 
repurchase of ordinary shares] and the board believes that it is in the best interests of the company and 
shareholders as a whole to consider a dividend when there is a more durable recovery and consequent earnings 
visibility," said Mr Barrington.
Aer Lingus in dividend move
Joe Gill, an analyst with Dublin-based Bloxham stockbrokers, said that Aer Lingus shareholders, which include 
Ryanair and the Irish government, would be likely to support the changes and forecast that a dividend could be paid 
in the future.
"Aer Lingus is well capable of paying a dividend. A special dividend in Aer Lingus may also be an alternative 
method for the government to extract some value without selling its 25 per cent stake," he said.
Royal Bank of Scotland said in a research note the proposal by Aer Lingus was a "modest positive" for Ryanair.
Ryanair responded to the statement by publishing an open letter to Mr Barrington urging him to reply to a 
September 28 message when the carrier outlined proposals to reverse the collapse of the company's share price. 
Ryanair asked Aer Lingus to consider a EUR110m special dividend.

RYANAIR ramped up pressure on Aer Lingus yesterday, calling in an open letter for the airline to take "urgent 
action" to improve its share price.
Undeterred by Aer Lingus' plan for a shareholder meeting announced yesterday, Ryanair penned its third open 
letter in the space of a month to ask for a (EURO)0.20 per share special dividend.
Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, has also asked the Irish airline to halt payments into its 
defined contribution pension scheme until shareholders give their approval.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary also repeated demands to see a report commissioned by Aer Lingus into a 
(EURO)30m (£26.3m) tax settlement.
Aer Lingus said yesterday that it will use a meeting on 4 November to seek approval from shareholders to cancel up 
to (EURO)500m in reserves, giving it flexibility to return cash to investors.
Shares in Aer Lingus, which have lost nearly half their value since the start of 2011, closed flat at (EURO)0.64 
yesterday.

Ryanair 's Open Letter No. 3 To Aer Lingus Seeks Response To Proposals
Ryanair's Open Letter No. 3 To Aer Lingus Seeks Response To Proposals

Body
(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA,L, RYAAY) Wednesday asked, via its third open letter, Aer Lingus Group 
plc (AERL.L) to respond to its proposals discussed in the earlier letter dated September 28, adding that 
shareholders expected "some degree of urgency" from the Board and Chairman of Aer Lingus. The letter, like the 
earlier ones, also highlighted that Aer Lingus share price had declined to "just over 60 euro cents" from 3 euros in 
2007.
The ongoing exchange, which began in Ryanair's original open letter dated September 13, follows Ryanair's 
confirmation that it would not bid to acquire the 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus held by the Irish government. 
Instead, both of its prior letters spelled out three proposals which Ryanair felt would "significantly rebuild" Aer 
Lingus's shareholder value.
In the second letter, Ryanair also rebutted claims that Aer Lingus's management and board were "fully dedicated" 
to "creating value" for its shareholders, and cited the decline in market capitalization, drop in share price and 
rejection of takeover offers as reflecting lack of action on the management's part.
Of the three proposals, one dealt with Aer Lingus's "refusal to publish" the Deloitte report, which investigated the 
use of shareholder funds totaling 30 million euros in settling what Ryanair believes were individual employee tax 
liabilities which the company was not liable to pay.
Additionally, Ryanair asked Aer Lingus to seek shareholder approval for the issuance of a special dividend and for 
any future contributions to its pension schemes. These actions, Ryanair suggested, would help restore Aer Lingus's 
share price closer to the rejected takeover offers of 1.40 euros per share and 2.80 euros per share.
RYA.L is currently trading up by 0.06 euros, or 2.03 percent, at 3.26 euros per share. At close on Tuesday, RYAAY 
traded at $27.00 per share.
AERL.L closed Tuesday's trading at 0.64 euros per share.

Passengers on Ryanair may soon need to cross their legs - or queue to use one toilet between more than 200 
people.
The airline has dropped its plan to charge passengers for using on-board toilets, but is pressing ahead with 
proposals to remove two of the three lavatories on each plane and replace them with seats.
The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has told The Independent newspaper in London: "It would 
fundamentally lower air fares by about five per cent for all passengers" - cutting GBP 2 from a typical GBP 40 
ticket."
The airline, which will carry 75m passengers this year, has only one aircraft type: the Boeing 737-800. Ryanair has 
installed 189 seats on each plane, the maximum allowed under current rules. "We're trying to push Boeing to re-
certify the aircraft for six more seats, particularly for short-haul flights", said Mr O'Leary. "We very rarely use all 
three toilets on board our aircraft anyway." The aircraft manufacturer gave a guarded response. A spokesman at 
Boeing HQ in Seattle said "We're always listening to what our customers need but don't discuss those 
conversations or any business decisions."

The airline, which has not made any dividend payment or other form of distribution to shareholders since its initial

However, it will seek the changes as its structure prohibits dividend payments owing to accumulated realised losses

"While the board believes that it is in the best interests of all shareholders to consider a dividend when there is a

Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, hit back at critics of the new Cash Passport scheme at its UK launch in London 
yesterday after influential consumer magazine, Which?, called it "an insult to travellers".
The new branded credit card allows people to avoid a £6 administration charge per Ryanair ticket but carries a 
charge of £6 to sign up for it.
Mr O'Leary said that passengers get back the £6 charge through a £6 Ryanair voucher.
However, the Cash Passport, issued by Access Prepaid (a Mastercard subsidiary), must be used at least once 
every six months in order to avoid Ryanair's charges. The cash passport card launched in Ireland two weeks ago 
and chief executive Michael O'Leary claims Ryanair has already sold 10,000 cards. He also dismissed concerns 
over payment protection on the card, refuting claims by the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) 
that passengers would lose their money if Mastercard's card issuer goes bust. "In such an unlikely event, both 
Ryanair and Access Prepaid (a Mastercard subsidiary) confirmed that ALL monies loaded onto Ryanair Cash 
Passport cards are held in trust for Mastercard cardholders and are protected," Mr O'Leary said. He also hit back at 
criticisms from rival card provider Fair FX. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "A true like for like comparison shows 
that the Ryanair Cash Passport card is much more competitive than the Fair FX card and Ryanair's current 
MasterCard pre-paid products for flights purchased on Ryanair.com." In his characteristicly brusque manner, he 
said most Ryanair charges can be avoided. O'Leary claimed that Ryanair was the only airline to have a dedicated 
section of its website detailing its individual charges and instructions on "how to avoid them". He said: "Please stop 
saying that we have a range of hidden fees when we could not be more upfront about our fees, the list of fees, and 
how the hell to avoid paying the optional fees." He listed the ways to avoid check-in charges, advanced-boarding 
charges, charges for flying with a baby. "The infant fee is avoidable by not having infants, which as a father of four 
relatively small children, I would highly recommend."

how the hell to avoid paying the optional fees." He listed the ways to avoid check-in charges, advanced-boarding 
charges, charges for flying with a baby. "The infant fee is avoidable by not having infants, which as a father of four 
relatively small children, I would highly recommend."

Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, hit back at critics of the new Cash Passport scheme at its UK launch in London 
yesterday after influential consumer magazine, Which?, called it "an insult to travellers".
The new branded credit card allows people to avoid a £6 administration charge per Ryanair ticket but carries a 
charge of £6 to sign up for it.
Mr O'Leary said that passengers get back the £6 charge through a £6 Ryanair voucher.
However, the Cash Passport, issued by Access Prepaid (a Mastercard subsidiary), must be used at least once 
every six months in order to avoid Ryanair's charges. The cash passport card launched in Ireland two weeks ago 
and chief executive Michael O'Leary claims Ryanair has already sold 10,000 cards. He also dismissed concerns 
over payment protection on the card, refuting claims by the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) 
that passengers would lose their money if Mastercard's card issuer goes bust. "In such an unlikely event, both 
Ryanair and Access Prepaid (a Mastercard subsidiary) confirmed that ALL monies loaded onto Ryanair Cash 
Passport cards are held in trust for Mastercard cardholders and are protected," Mr O'Leary said. He also hit back at 
criticisms from rival card provider Fair FX. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "A true like for like comparison shows 
that the Ryanair Cash Passport card is much more competitive than the Fair FX card and Ryanair's current 
MasterCard pre-paid products for flights purchased on Ryanair.com." In his characteristicly brusque manner, he 
said most Ryanair charges can be avoided. O'Leary claimed that Ryanair was the only airline to have a dedicated 
section of its website detailing its individual charges and instructions on "how to avoid them". He said: "Please stop 
saying that we have a range of hidden fees when we could not be more upfront about our fees, the list of fees, and

Donal Rogers has experienced both ends of the airline industry spectrum, and is using this knowledge to turn a 
healthy profit and exceed all expectations as chief executive of Dublin Aerospace
Donal Rogers is one of the few chief executives left in Ireland who can boast of having a jet parked outside his 
office. Unfortunately, it's not his.
Instead, the Airbus A320 outside the door belongs to Aer Lingus, and it's in with Rogers, the chief executive of 
Dublin Aerospace, for an overhaul. It is the first of eight jets that Dublin Aerospace will service for the national 
carrier this winter, and Rogers is justifiably pleased with the deal.
Set up two years ago to take over parts of the SR Technics aircraft maintenance business, Dublin Aerospace has 
since beaten all its own targets. The company has more than 220 staff at Dublin Airport, including contractors, and 
is hiring up to 50 more permanent staff in the coming months.
It has won contracts as far afield as Ukraine, Denmark and the Seychelles, and has just completed a profitable 
second year in business. Revenues rose to almost  22 million, from  8 million in its first year, and Rogers is 
confident in predicting a figure of  28 million for the coming year.
It's a quiet success story following the high-profile closure of SRTechnics in 2009 with the loss of 1,100 jobs. Most 
of Dublin Aerospace's staff are former SRTechnics workers who feared the worst as the shutdown - and an ensuing 
row between Ryanair and the government over jobs - occupied the headlines, according to Rogers.
''It's great, especially after what happened with SRTechnics. They didn't get much [redundancy] notice, and it 
looked bleak," he said.
However, airline industry veteran Conor McCarthy entered the fray with Dublin Aerospace, set up specifically to 
take on some of the SRTechnics business.
''It's very hard to escape from the airline industry. It's never boring"
The company has three divisions: aircraft overhaul, servicing landing gear and servicing auxiliary power units 
(APUs), which power the lights and air conditioning on a plane. It works from 21,000 square metres of hangar 
space at Dublin Airport and has won several sizeable contracts, including a six-year deal with Easy Jet to service 
landing gear on its fleet.
A five-year APU deal was sealed last month with Danish airline Jet Time, while Air Seychelles, Ukraine International 
and XL Airways in Germany are also customers. The firm serviced 12 Aer Lingus jets last winter and has just 
signed the contract to overhaul its A320s this year and next.
''We're really pleased with the Aer Lingus deal. It went out to tender and we were up against all the other 
maintenance firms in the world. This is difficult business to win," said Rogers.
The plane in the workshop is one of Aer Lingus's first A320s, and will get ''a heavy check'' lasting about three 
weeks. ''You wouldn't recognise the interior of the aircraft - the seats come out, the floors come out, the wall panels 
come out. Most of the wiring is hidden, so it all comes out."
Dublin Aerospace focuses on 'narrow-bodied' aircraft such as Airbus A320s or Boeing 737s, although it can take a 
747 in Hangar 5 at Dublin Airport. It is spending $6 million upgrading the landing gear facility at Dublin Airport and 
sees scope for growth in that business.
''With investment, we can double the landing gear business. In the APU business, there is scope for expansion - it 
can easily triple," said Rogers, who is targeting airlines around the world.
The firm has won business in eastern Europe and Russia, and Rogers recently spoke at a seminar organised by 
Ulster Bank and Enterprise Ireland on doing business in the east.
''We have good repeat business coming out of there. Our initial venture into Russia was a learning curve, but our 
experience has been very positive. We've worked for Rossiya, Orenair, Ural Airlines, Sky Express and Air Baltic, 
and have long-term contracts with Ukraine International.
''We're trading in Britain, central Europe, Russia, the Far East, the US and Africa. We go after business from 
airlines and leasing companies all over the world, especially in landing gear and APU work. The APUs are easily 
transportable - they have to travel anyway, so it might as well be Ireland."
Rogers said that Dublin Aerospace got strong support from Enterprise Ireland, which invested  6 million in the 
business when it was founded. Another  6.5 million came from McCarthy, aerospace firm EADS and Tony 
Fernandes, with whom McCarthy worked in setting up Air Asia a decade ago.
T here is a small number of private investors in the business, but Rogers is not a shareholder ''at the moment''. It 
also has debt financing of  9.25 million, which funded the buyout of the SRTechnics assets.
A chartered accountant, Rogers had a surprise introduction to the aviation sector more than a decade ago. A native 
of Longford, he did his accountancy training in Dublin and then moved to England where he worked for KPMG and 
the Granada Group. Returning to Ireland in 1995, he spent 15 months with Team Aer Lingus before moving to a job 
in finance with Teagasc. In late 2000, an unexpected opportunity arose.
''This opportunity came up in Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines, which is the second-biggest airline in Turkey. It was a 
bit of a joke at first," said Rogers. ''They had an Irish chief financial officer and Irish general manager, who was ex-
Aer Lingus. They wanted a chartered accountant."
On ''a miserable winter night'' in Ireland, Rogers decided to take the job in a sector and a country he knew little 
about. ''It was a good opportunity, both career-wise and financially. I f you go out somewhere with the frame of mind 
that it will be very different, it works out perfectly," he said.
Rogers moved his family to Turkey, where his children attended an international school.
''It's very hard to escape from the airline industry. It's never boring"
''They really enjoyed it. I still have good friends there, both in business and socially," he said. He stayed five years, 
becoming chief financial officer and deputy chief executive of Pegasus.
''Once you get into the airline industry, it's very hard to escape from it," said Rogers.
''It's never boring. The first year I was with Pegasus, the second Gulf War broke out and Turkey was in the news 
because there was a US base there. Tourism and the airlines were badly hit."
In late 2005, Pegasus was changing hands, and it seemed like a good time for Rogers and his family to return to 
Ireland - except it didn't work out that way. Briefly back in Ireland, he had his first meeting with McCarthy, who was 
setting up a low-cost carrier in Mexico, Viva Aerobus.
''When I joined, the airline didn't exist, it wasn't licensed. I went to Mexico for six months, and I ended up staying 
five years and becoming the chief executive," said Rogers. ''It was a challenging start-up. We had the language 
barrier, and we had to get across to people the culture of what it was about. We had a focus on cost, so we had 
open-plan offices and no secretaries. It was unheard of."
The airline shook up the market by offering low fares and taking bookings only over the phone and on the internet. 
''People said it would never work without travel agents, but it has done well and has 18 aircraft now," said Rogers, 
who finished a two-and-a-half-year stint as chief executive last year.
Happy with the work Rogers had done in Mexico, McCarthy approached him in September last year about the top 
job at Dublin Aerospace. He took over on January 1 this year.
The new job puts him on the other side of the table from his roles at Viva Aerobus and Pegasus. ''I was used to 
working on the airline side and hammering the maintenance companies. I'd be asking: 'Why is it costing this much? 
Why is it late?' Now I can see the other side of it."
''We have a good group of people, and the culture is great. There aren't layers of supervisors all over the place," 
said Rogers. ''We have a non-hierarchical organisation where everyone earns their keep. It's nice to see the volume 
of work - quality work - that we put through this year."
The employees have reason to be happy too - they are part of a profit-sharing scheme that is calculated quarterly 
so, when the firm makes money, they make money.
''Everybody feels like it's their business too; the profit-sharing scheme makes them keen. The first three quarters of 
the year were profitable, and the last one [which ran up to the end of last month] will be as well."
A large contingent of staff will attend the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards later this month, where 
Conor McCarthy, the company chairman, is a finalist. An aviation engineer by profession, he held senior roles at 
Aer Lingus and Ryanair before going on to set up Air Asia, Viva Aerobus and Dublin Aerospace. He also runs an 
airline consultancy called Plane Consult.
Rogers said that, if he won, the award would be shared by everyone at Dublin Aerospace. He added that he saw 
the firm as an example of how companies might look in post-boom Ireland. ''We've turned around a massive, loss-
making operation in SRTechnics into a smaller, profitable operation," he said.
''Ireland wasn't competitive any more. We are competing with the rest of the world on cost, and we had priced 
ourselves out of business. All companies have to adjust to that reality."

Dublin Aerospace, the aircraft maintenance company set up in 2009 after SR Technics pulled out of Ireland, plans 
to hire 50 more permanent staff after winning several new contracts.
The company has been awarded a two-year contract by Aer Lingus to overhaul 16 of its Airbus A320s and also has 
new deals with XL Airways in Germany and Air Via in Bulgaria.
It will work on four aircraft for XL Airways this winter and nine aircraft for Air Via over the next two years.
Donal Rogers, chief executive of Dublin Aerospace, said the company would hire up to 50 more full-time staff in the 
coming months, bringing its permanent workforce to around 160 people. The company employs more than 220 
workers, including contractors.
It has three lines of business: aircraft overhaul, servicing landing gear and servicing the auxiliary power units on 
aircraft. Since buying assets from SR Technics when the Swiss firm pulled out, it occupies a total of 21,000 square 
metres of hangar space at Dublin Airport.
As well as permanent workers, Dublin Aerospace is recruiting 15 trainees under a new programme set up in 
conjunction with Fás. Rogers said the programme, which combines theory and practical work, was 'an innovation 
both for Dublin Aerospace and Fás.
Rogers said that Dublin Aerospace had beaten its own financial and employment targets to date. It had revenues of  
22 million in the financial year to the end of last month, up from  8 million the previous year. The company is 
profitable and cash-flow positive, he said.
Its staff are members of a profit-sharing scheme, which pays out quarterly. Rogers said that the firm's biggest costs 
were rent and rates at Dublin Airport. ''We pay rates on the space we use, but we use a lot more space than a 
different type of business with 220 staff," he said.
Dublin Aerospace set to take on 50 new staff
The firm was set up by aviation veteran Conor McCarthy after SR Technics decided to pull out of Ireland, with the 
loss of 1,100 jobs.
At the time, Ryanair claimed it could save hundreds of the jobs if the government allowed it to take over hangar 
space held by Aer Lingus at Dublin airport.

The Competition Commission has ordered BAA to begin the process of selling one of its Scottish airports, bringing 
forward a divestment first ordered 2½ years ago.
Disposal of either Glasgow or Edinburgh will now precede any sale of Stansted, changing the schedule the 
commission laid out in its 2009 report, which found the airport operator dominated markets in Scotland and south-
east England.
BAA's holdings at the time included Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. It 
was already in the process of selling Gatwick .
The commission ordered BAA, owned by Spain's Ferrovial, to complete that sale, then proceed to selling Stansted 
before disposing of either Edinburgh or Glasgow. But the process has been delayed by a raft of appeals - most 
recently BAA's request for a judicial review of the ruling to sell Stansted.
"It is clearer now than it has ever been that Heathrow and Stansted serve different markets," Colin Matthews, BAA's 
chief executive, said.
Earlier on Friday, Ryanair condemned what it called delaying tactics by BAA and the raising of fees at Stansted, 
which it said had suffered five years of traffic declines. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said: "Any other 
company faced with a 27 per cent drop in passenger numbers would respond by cutting its prices. BAA's response 
has been to more than double landing charges at Stansted."

An idea to tackle rising demand has found critics, write Andrew Parker , Jim Pickard   and Mark Odell
Body
Ever since the coalition government ruled out allowing new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted airports, 
ministers have been accused by the aviation industry of lacking a credible policy to deal with rising long-term 
demand for air travel.
In theory, the ambitious proposal to integrate Heathrow and Gatwick through a high-speed rail link could form the 
solution, but the industry has quickly denounced the idea.
Ministers have been told by business that a new aviation policy was badly needed as part of efforts to boost the 
flagging economy.
A report published last month said the UK was at serious risk of missing out on trade with emerging markets worth 
£14bn during the next decade because Heathrow was operating at full capacity and could not expand.
Those findings about the capacity-crunch in the south-east explain why ministers are coming under pressure to 
speed up their policymaking. They previously promised an aviation framework by 2013.
Ministers may now be focusing their minds but, on Friday, airlines and airport operators lined up to express grave 
misgivings about the interest in creating a "virtual hub" between Heathrow and Gatwick.
British Airways said linking Heathrow and Gatwick "does absolutely nothing to address the ever more pressing 
issue of the south-east's need to have more airport capacity in order for the UK to remain globally competitive". 
BAA, Heathrow's owner, said the idea "faces insurmountable technical, operational, political and financial 
challenges, and would take many years to deliver".
A rail industry executive who declined to be named said it would be difficult to build a high-speed network between 
Heathrow and Gatwick.
Airports rail link fails to carry industry
The government is holding to its view that it will not allow the construction of more runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or 
Stansted.
But ministers think additional airport capacity might be found by linking Heathrow and Gatwick. Following the 
construction of a high-speed network between the two airports, the idea would be for Gatwick to focus on short and 
medium-haul flights to and from Europe.
Some of these Gatwick flights could then provide important feeder traffic to Heathrow, which would focus on long-
haul destinations.
Gatwick has some room to accommodate extra flights because it is operating at 80 per cent capacity.
In theory, more capacity could be found if Ryanair and EasyJet, the low-cost airlines, ended their operations at 
Gatwick and concentrated on Stansted and other airports, such as Luton.
Ryanair and EasyJet might choose to sell their take-off and landing slots at Gatwick if they increase in value 
because of the high-speed rail link with Heathrow.
But Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said there was "no way of moving the budget airlines out of 
Gatwick". He added: "There won't be a high- speed rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick in my lifetime. The cost 
of it would be prohibitive."
EasyJet, which dismissed the idea of linking Heathrow and Gatwick, said: "EasyJet will fight any attempt to force us 
out of Gatwick all the way."

Highlight: Proposed high-speed rail link for airports
Body
A radical plan for a new "Heathwick" airport hub featuring a £5bn high-speed rail link between Heathrow and 
Gatwick is being considered seriously by ministers, the Financial Times has learnt.
The idea was put forward as an alternative to the politically unpalatable expansion of Heathrow and is being closely 
examined by ministers, who are under pressure to increase airport capacity in the south-east of England.
The British Chambers of Commerce suggested two years ago that high-speed rail could be used to link Heathrow 
and Gatwick, creating a "collective hub". Victoria Borwick, a member of the Greater London Authority's transport 
committee and former Conservative party treasurer, will today call for a more detailed consultation into the idea.
She believes her proposal will expand capacity around London without jeopardising the coalition's promise not to 
build new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted.
Stansted, in Essex, is relatively unpopular with airlines and is only running at 58 per cent capacity.
Building a 15-minute link between Heathrow and Gatwick could increase the price of landing slots at the latter, and 
eventually force low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet to move to Stansted.
This could free up more slots at the new "Heathwick" hub for an expansion of regional capacity.
A spokesman for the Department for Transport said a draft aviation policy would be published for consultation in the 
spring.
"We are seeking views on the key issues which need to be addressed, including the importance of a UK hub airport 
and whether it might be possible to create a 'virtual hub' by improving connectivity between existing airports," he 
said.
Welcome to 'Heathwick' - ministers consider radical £5bn plan for hub
The 35-mile high-speed rail route would see trains travelling at up to 180mph parallel to the M25. Passengers would 
not need to pass through immigration or check-in twice.
The route would take several years to legislate and another five to build. As such it would be faster to build than 
alternatives including the £40bn "Boris Airport" proposed by London's mayor, Boris Johnson, for the Thames 
estuary.
"We have all heard of ideas floating around such as Boris Airport, Cliffe Airport or RAF Manston but most are 25 
years off," said Ms Borwick.
"We need to look at what we can do in a reasonable time frame and to a reasonable budget."

The rally in ISEQ shares ran out of steam this morning as investors took profits and ahead of a key U.S. labour 
report that may show whether the world's biggest economy is headed for a recession.
By 12:30, the index was down 5.48 points to 2,544.43.
U.S. employment likely grew only modestly in September, with hiring too weak to pull down a lofty jobless rate and 
dispel recession fears. "Anything (in the U.S. data) that looks negative could reverse the relief rally, though it's likely 
to be an inconclusive number," Bill Blain, strategist at NewEdge Group in London, said, adding he was sceptical 
about the main driver of the rally. "There is no plan to recapitalise the banks. All there is, is chitter-chatter. The 
equity markets are phenomenally stupid. The market is hearing what it wants to hear." European governments are 
simultaneously contemplating making banks take a bigger writedown on Greek debt, taxing their financial 
transactions and boosting their capital base.
Aer Lingus has released September passenger statistics showing passengers up 2.9pc in the month. However, 
including Aer Lingus Regional (the joint venture with Aer Arann, which saw a 44.9pc increase) the figures were up 
closer to 5.0pc for the month. Short haul passengers rose by 2.5pc in September, with a much stronger 7.0pc jump 
in long haul. Revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) were up 5.0pc in the month and compare to ASKs (available 
seat kilometres) up 1.4pc, which implies an increase in load factors. Loads were up 290bps in total to 83.9pc, with a 
190bps uptick in short haul load factors, outpaced by a 520bps increment in long haul. Shares in the airline were 
flat at E0.65 as was Ryanair at E3.16. Shares in Smurfit Kappa fell 21c to E4.07. Goodbody Stockbrokers said a 
number of factors that helped European containerboard pricing recover from the third quarter of 2009 to now have 
now become slight headwinds, namely weaker testliner exports, strong US Kraftliner imports and lower OCC prices. 
"Furthermore, with underlying industrial production softening in Europe, the industry faces the prospect of supply 
growth exceeding that of demand. Given that uncertainties over economic developments are likely to remain, these

headwinds will persist in the short-term," said analyst, David O'Brien. Problems continue to mount at Premier 
Foods, the troubled UK branded food manufacturer. In the Q3 IMS, the new CEO warned that the full-year trading 
profit would be below market expectations. In the quarter, sales were down 3.6pc, but this included volume declines 
of 8pc, with Hovis again being a core problem area with volumes off 13.5pc. Shares in Glanbia fell 12c to E4.35, 
Greencore dropped 2c to E0.57 and Kerry was up 14c to E25.98.

Iberia to launch low-cost airline
Iberia to launch low-cost airline

Iberia on Thursday announced plans to create a new low-cost airline called Iberia Express, as part of efforts to 
improve the Spanish flag-carrier's profitability.
International Airlines Group, the company created through the merger of Iberia and British Airways, hopes the new 
low-cost carrier will provide stronger competition on short and medium-haul routes for budget airlines led by Ryanair 
and EasyJet.
However, Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, said the plans for Iberia Express broke agreements signed with Iberia 
during its merger with British Airways.
"The creation of the new company is illegal, violating the agreements signed with Iberia in connection with the 
merger," said Sepla, which is considering strike action over the plans.
It means Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, could get embroiled in another episode of industrial unrest. Last year, 
cabin crew at BA went on strike over plans to reduce staff on long-haul flights, and the bitter dispute was only 
resolved in June.
Iberia Express will start operations with four aircraft next summer from Madrid airport, but it should have 13 jets by 
the end of 2012.
"Iberia Express will have lower operating costs than Iberia's lossmaking short and medium-haul business," said 
IAG. "The subsidiary will recruit new staff at market rates."
The pressure from Ryanair and EasyJet has weighed on Iberia's results, and it reported a EUR78m ($104m) 
operating loss for the six months to June 30. BA reported a EUR210m operating profit in the first half of 2011.
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, said no one at the flag carrier would lose their job following the 
creation of Iberia Express. It will not operate all of Iberia's short and medium-haul operations from next year, but the

number of routes provided by the new airline is likely to increase over time. Iberia has 68 aircraft on short and 
medium-haul routes.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said European flag carriers needed to maintain their loss-making 
short-haul operations to provide feeder traffic for their profitable long-haul business.
He added that it was clear Iberia would rapidly transfer routes to Iberia Express. "We therefore see a distinct 
possibility of a strike by pilots and cabin crew at Iberia, but we believe the longer-term benefits to shareholders 
significantly outweigh the short-term cost of any strike action," said Mr van Klaveren.

The ISEQ powered ahead today after the ECB's meeting on rates and on news of co-ordinated action to 
recapitalise Europe's banks.
The index rose 69.12 points to 2,549.91.
Global stocks rallied for a third straight day after the ECB renewed offers to aid ailing regional banks, a move that 
drew a mixed reaction from investors. The ECB threw another lifeline to struggling European banks with an offer of 
longer-term loans to ward off a new credit crunch, but it also kept interest rates unchanged at 1.5 percent after a 
meeting in Berlin. European stock markets jumped, but Wall Street initially fell, as investors parsed the ECB's 
efforts to contain a sovereign debt crisis that has threatened to send recovering economies back into recession. 
Jean-Claude Trichet, in his final news conference as president of the ECB, said the bank's governing council 
decided to launch a new, covered-bond purchase program by spending E40 billion over a 12-month period from 
November.
Ryanair's shares rose 1c to E3.17. The no-frills airline reported September passenger statistics this week showing 
growth of 6pc in the month, to 7.25m passengers. Load factors were 100 basis points lower at 85pc. This wraps up 
fiscal second quarter for the airline and brings the quarterly growth rate to 6.1pc, with load factors flat at 87.7pc. 
"Previous guidance from Ryanair was for 4pc growth in the quarter to 23m passengers, so the performance is a 
modest 0.47m better (+2pc) than that initial target. However, after the August traffic stats, when 6pc growth was 
also recorded, it was clear that the figure was likely to move through the 23m (+4pc) figure for the quarter," said 
Goodbody's analyst, Eamonn Hughes. Shares in Aer Lingus were flat at E0.65. Kerry Group's shares rose 37c to 
E25.77. Modest growth in a challenging market was the key theme from Cranswick and Greggs this morning. 
Cranswick, the UK pig meat processor, said it saw volumes increase 7pc in Q2 due in part, to the fact that pig meat 
is gaining share at the expense of other proteins on a value-for-money basis. Greggs, meanwhile, is seeing slower

growth, with like for like sales up just 0.8pc in Q3, with its statement peppered with comments about "promotional 
activity" and "meal deals" which the company is using to entice customers in the current tough environment. "From 
Kerry's standpoint, rising demand for pig meat products should be positive for its UK sausage business, while in the 
case of Greencore, much of its growth is being generated by market share gain and we are anticipating sales 
growth of 6pc in 2011," said Goodbody's analyst, Liam Igoe. UK merchanting figures for August have been released 
by the Builders Merchants Federation (BMF). According to the BMF, UK merchanting volumes in August were down 
6.5pc compared to the same month last year. Taking the June to August quarter as a better gauge of underlying 
trends, volumes were 6.2pc lower than the same three months in 2010. Volumes year-to-date are now circa 3.5pc 
lower than the same period in 2010. Shares in Grafton Group rose 4c to E2.69.

The ISEQ powered ahead today after the ECB's meeting on rates and on news of co-ordinated action to 
recapitalise Europe's banks.
The index rose 69.12 points to 2,549.91.
Global stocks rallied for a third straight day after the ECB renewed offers to aid ailing regional banks, a move that 
drew a mixed reaction from investors. The ECB threw another lifeline to struggling European banks with an offer of 
longer-term loans to ward off a new credit crunch, but it also kept interest rates unchanged at 1.5 percent after a 
meeting in Berlin. European stock markets jumped, but Wall Street initially fell, as investors parsed the ECB's 
efforts to contain a sovereign debt crisis that has threatened to send recovering economies back into recession. 
Jean-Claude Trichet, in his final news conference as president of the ECB, said the bank's governing council 
decided to launch a new, covered-bond purchase program by spending E40 billion over a 12-month period from 
November.
Ryanair's shares rose 1c to E3.17. The no-frills airline reported September passenger statistics this week showing 
growth of 6pc in the month, to 7.25m passengers. Load factors were 100 basis points lower at 85pc. This wraps up 
fiscal second quarter for the airline and brings the quarterly growth rate to 6.1pc, with load factors flat at 87.7pc. 
"Previous guidance from Ryanair was for 4pc growth in the quarter to 23m passengers, so the performance is a 
modest 0.47m better (+2pc) than that initial target. However, after the August traffic stats, when 6pc growth was 
also recorded, it was clear that the figure was likely to move through the 23m (+4pc) figure for the quarter," said 
Goodbody's analyst, Eamonn Hughes. Shares in Aer Lingus were flat at E0.65. Kerry Group's shares rose 37c to 
E25.77. Modest growth in a challenging market was the key theme from Cranswick and Greggs this morning. 
Cranswick, the UK pig meat processor, said it saw volumes increase 7pc in Q2 due in part, to the fact that pig meat 
is gaining share at the expense of other proteins on a value-for-money basis. Greggs, meanwhile, is seeing slower

growth, with like for like sales up just 0.8pc in Q3, with its statement peppered with comments about "promotional 
activity" and "meal deals" which the company is using to entice customers in the current tough environment. "From

REGIONAL airline group Flybe yesterday saw its shares plummet by 36 per cent after it slashed guidance for its 
2012 profits, due to a slowdown in demand on domestic flights.
In its second profit warning this year, Flybe said revenues in the six months to October were one per cent behind 
management's expectations while costs were in line with expectations.
Shares have fallen 70 per cent since Flybe's flotation on the London Stock Exchange at the end of last year when it 
raised £60m for European expansion.
Flybe's first profit warning in May sent shares down by a quarter.
The Exeter-based group led by chairman Jim French said it was too early to determine whether the slowdown in 
September trading was "a short term reaction to the turbulent macro-economic environment" or a longer term 
market adjustment.
Revenues at Flybe were three per cent higher than last year when taking into account the impact of the 2010 
volcanic ash disruption, which cost the company about £12m.
House broker Investec, which cut its full-year estimates from £20m to £6.5m, said it still saw long term value in the 
Flybe shares.
Industry experts said the news was part of a wider trend. British Airways' owner International Airlines Group 
published figures yesterday forecasting a softening of trade and consumer demand in October, while Ryanair's load 
factor fell last month.

IAG and Flybe add to gloom over airlines

Highlight: Reduced demand for business travel
Profit warning from regional airline
Body
Two European airlines on Wednesday added to the gloom about the industry's near-term prospects, with 
International Airlines Group highlighting reduced demand for business travel and Flybe issuing a profit warning.
IAG, Europe's third-largest airline by revenue and owner of British Airways and Iberia, said that "indications so far 
for October point to a softer demand picture" in premium passenger traffic and air cargo.
Shares in Flybe, Europe's largest regional airline by routes, closed down 36 per cent at 65p after it guided the 
market towards lower full-year profit due to reduced demand for UK domestic flights.
Amid the deteriorating economic environment, Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline by revenue, last month issued a 
profit warning after disappointing sales in August and lower-than-expected flight bookings for September and 
October.
However, while IAG signalled it was prepared to cut seating capacity in response to reduced demand, the airline 
said it was on course "to produce significant growth in operating profit in 2011" compared with last year.
IAG's shares closed up 4.5 per cent at 156p.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said IAG's passenger traffic data for September were stronger than 
he expected.
"It's encouraging that corporate travel seems to be holding up," said Mr Klaveren, referring to IAG's 9.3 per cent 
increase in premium traffic in September compared with the same time last year. "This data would suggest IAG is 
outperforming its peers."
IAG and Flybe add to gloom over airlines
Business travellers are European flag carriers' most valuable customers, generating about 50 per cent of their 
revenues.
IAG's figures alluded to the contrasting performances of its two operating companies. BA, which reported a 
EUR210m ($279.9m) operating profit in the six months to June 30, recorded passenger traffic growth of 6 per cent 
in September compared with the same time last year. Iberia, which reported an operating loss of EUR78m for the 
half-year, recorded traffic growth of 0.8 per cent in September.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue, underlined its resilience in the weakening economic 
environment by outlining passenger traffic growth of 6 per cent in September.
Meanwhile, Flybe said revenue for the six months to September 30 was 1 per cent below management's 
expectations, with costs staying in line with forecasts.
Most of the revenue shortfall appeared to have come from September trading, when the airline "noted a significant 
slowdown in sales across our domestic network". It also said ticket revenue since September 30 was up 1 per cent 
compared with the same time last year, lagging expectations.
Analysts said the sell-off did not seem an over-reaction given the high operational gearing of Flybe, where a 
revenue shortfall of 1 per cent can take 30 per cent off pre-tax profit.
Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley, said: "Flybe's challenge has been to show profits commensurate with 
the strength of the brand. But Britain's feeble economy is conspiring to prevent that."
The aviation industry is facing regulatory as well as economic challenges. Today, an advocate general to the 
European Court of Justice will give an opinion on whether non-European airlines should have to comply with the 
European Union's carbon emissions trading scheme.

Despite the ongoing crisis in eurozone debt, the possibility of Greek default, fears over Europe's bank capitalisation 
levels and economic growth, Irish shares joined with world bourses in a rebound today.
The index rose 50.67 points to 2,480.79.
The ISEQ managed to recoup over half the losses it made on Tuesday as volatility becomes the norm in global 
equities.
European shares and key commodities bounced after ministers agreed to shore up euro zone banks against the 
spreading debt crisis and an IMF director said the fund might offer support by buying Spanish and Italian bonds. 
The euro recovered from losses against the dollar after the International Monetary Fund's European Department 
Director Antonio Borges said it could invest in peripheral debt alongside the euro zone bailout fund. World stocks 
and commodities including Brent crude had slumped in recent sessions on mounting concerns that a debt default 
by Greece could trigger a banking crisis that would aggravate a worldwide economic slowdown. Overnight, France 
and Belgium rescued financial services group Dexia -- heavily exposed to Greek loans and the first European 
lender to have to be bailed out because of the debt crisis. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner 
Olli Rehn told the Financial Times on Tuesday the region's finance ministers, who have hitherto rejected any 
concerted bank recapitalisation, had a new sense of urgency. British online gaming firm Sportingbet said talks over 
a possible takeover by bookmaker Ladbrokes were continuing as it posted higher-than-expected full-year earnings, 
sending its shares up 7pc today. Sportingbet also said talks were also still going on over the possible sale of its 
Turkish language website business to GVC Holdings, a move seen as critical to clear the way for a Ladbrokes deal. 
Shares in Paddy Power jumped 100c to E39.00. CRH was the next biggest mover, gaining 63c to E11.95. The 
highly complicated transaction to take over Quinn Insurance is inching towards completion. The transaction passed 
its first hurdle yesterday in the High Court where the hearing began with the administrator's case for selling the 
ISEQ stages rebound on rescue hopes ISEQ up
insurer to Anglo Irish and Liberty Mutual. Court hearings are anticipated for the rest of the week and the transfer of 
the business is not anticipated until the end of the month. Shares in FBD fell 1c to E6.54. Greenbuild 2011 is being 
currently held in Toronto, at which Kingspan will be showcasing its Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) as 
part of the initiative "Path to NetZero". EPD is a standardised, international recognised tool for providing information 
on a product's environmental impact, which for the first time has been awarded to a North American-based 
manufacturer of insulated panels. Shares in Kingspan were flat at E5.95. Ryanair reported a 6pc annual rise in 
passenger numbers in September. In the first half of 2011/2012, its UK rival, Flybe delivered a strong revenue 
performance with an increase over the previous year in passenger revenue of circa 9pc (a near 3pc increase 
excluding the impact of the 2010 volcanic ash). UK regions to European business city routes performed particularly 
well. Ryanair shares fell 4c to E3.17.

excluding the impact of the 2010 volcanic ash). UK regions to European business city routes performed particularly 
well. Ryanair shares fell 4c to E3.17.

EUROPEAN airline shares followed US counterparts in a downward spiral yesterday as investors' confidence in the 
sector ebbed away. International passenger numbers across airlines dropped in August, a month that traditionally 
provides a boost with summer holidays in full swing.
Air France-KLM was down more than nine per cent as the sector took a hammering amid gloomy forecasts on world 
growth.
International Airlines Group - which encompasses BA - was off by more than three per cent as the grim trend 
spread across the major carriers.
Even budget carriers were hit, with Ryanair dropping close to four per cent and easyJet falling 1.5 per cent.
Shares in American Airlines' parent company AMR nosedived by a third on Monday amid fears that the carrier may 
be forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Under Chapter 11 a company can enter bankruptcy on its own terms.
Yesterday its shares recovered slightly from a 41 per cent slump on Monday, which triggered automatic halts in 
trading.
Rumours about a possible restructuring appear to have sparked the sell-off, including reports that a large number of 
pilots were retiring early in case a filing affected their retirement plans.
Fears of a second recession in the US also contributed towards the share drop, which affected other airline shares.
Europe's airlines hit by turbulence in US AVIATION
Delta Air Lines shares rose around four per cent yesterday, after an 11.3 per cent fall, while United Continental was 
flat in the wake of Monday's 11.7 per cent drop.
AMR said there was "no companydriven news that caused the volatility" and described market about bankruptcy as 
"rumours and speculation".
The Texas-based carrier maintains that it does not want to file for bankruptcy protection.
Earlier in the week the International Air Transport Association said the total passenger market was down 1.6 per 
cent while cargo was down 1.3 per cent compared with July.

It's gratifying when private corporate disagreements erupt into the open. It confirms the perception that business, 
often dressed up as a decorous diplomatic dance, is in fact a vicious hand-to-hand battle. It was in this spirit that I 
welcomed the recent outbreak of hostilities between Oracle, the software group headed by Larry Ellison, and 
Autonomy, the UK technology company founded by Mike Lynch and now being taken over by Hewlett-Packard.
To recap: Mr Ellison alleged on a conference call that Autonomy had first been "shopped" to Oracle but the price 
had been "absurdly high". Mr Lynch riposted that Mr Ellison's remarks were "inaccurate" and his understanding of 
Autonomy's business weak. Oracle retorted that "either Mr Lynch has a very poor memory or he's lying" about an 
April meeting with Oracle executives. The two sides finally fought themselves to a standstill, leaving the impression 
that the company was shopped to Oracle - but earlier and by a banker acting independently (out of the goodness of 
his heart, as bankers do). Move along now, nothing to see here.
US technology companies are notorious for this rough-and-tumble public rivalry. Sometimes this criticism is direct, 
such as Mr Ellison's jibes against rivals including HP, Microsoft and SAP. Sometimes it is more subtle, like Jeff 
Bezos's sideways criticism of the price and performance deficiencies of Apple's iPad at last week's launch of 
Amazon's Kindle tablet.
Michael O'Leary, mouthy boss of Ryanair, the budget airline, has virtually built the company's identity on public 
attacks against rivals - from EasyJet to British Airways to Aer Lingus. In the same sector, Virgin Atlantic's Sir 
Richard Branson fuelled his airline's challenge to BA in the 1980s and early 1990s with some brutal public sparring.
In long-running disputes, at least one of the antagonists is usually an entrepreneur or owner with the authority and 
personality to throw punches publicly. There are exceptions, such as the dull and interminable tug of war between 
Boeing and Airbus over which has sold most aircraft. But faceless companies generally foster rivalry in private. It is 
as hard to imagine Unilever's chief executive publicly accusing his Nestlé counterpart of being an amnesiac or a liar 
as it is to imagine Mr Ellison trading his superyacht for a pair of comfortable slippers and a pipe.
The trick is to know when to shut up
Rivalry is a double-edged management tool, however. A recent study analysed US college basketball and found 
that players tried harder against traditional rivals. Co-author Gavin Kilduff of New York University's Stern School of 
Business told me that publicity for the game could further stoke up the antagonism. But the study also warns that 
intense corporate rivalry, as distinct from mere competition, "opens up the possibility of economically irrational 
behaviour" including an "unwillingness to co-operate with rivals even when it is instrumentally beneficial".
This can get personal. Speaking at a private lunch last week, the grizzled chairman of a large listed UK group 
recalled how an executive at a multinational brusquely declined to sell to him early in his career. Promoted decades 
later to run a big client of this multinational, he took great pleasure telling the same executive how he would never 
buy from him or his company, even if he gave away its product. Satisfying, no doubt, but hardly good business.
Extreme rivalry can lead to unethical behaviour - like the so-called "dirty tricks" campaign BA ran against Virgin . A 
follow-up paper by Prof Kilduff and others looks at Italian soccer derbies: it finds that when arch-rivals meet, players 
are more likely to commit serious fouls.
So, managers (on and off the sports pitch) must be careful not to encourage the wrong sort of rivalry - and they 
need to pick their moment to take such spats public.
Unlike Mr Ellison, very much in charge of his company, Mr Lynch has just agreed the sale of his - to HP, which was 
probably the real target of Mr Ellison's initial jab. Mr Lynch should have welcomed the fact that his company had 
discomfited Oracle enough to earn a mention and left it at that. If I were an Autonomy employee at this time of 
takeover uncertainty, I would not be fired up by Mr Lynch's counter-attack against Mr Ellison; I'd be worried the boss 
had got us into a brawl with one of the biggest boys on the technology block.

according to a lobby group that will object the sale of the insurer in High Court this week. It says the number of 
policies has fallen from 800,000 on April last year - when Anglo Irish Bank took control of the Quinn Group - to 
296,653 on September 16. The claims are made by Concerned Irish Business, a 550-strong lobby group of Quinn 
supporters. They want to suspend the deal to sell Quinn Insurance to Anglo Irish Bank and the US insurer Liberty 
Mutual pending an inquiry. Meanwhile, Sinn Fein TD Caomhghin O Caolain has revealed the existence of a tape in 
which an administrator tells Quinn staff the family would "never have any involvement in this insurance company 
again". - Sunday Independent
## AIB has told the government that the salary of its new chief executive will be within the state-imposed cap of 
500,000 euros a year. The bank is entering the final stages of the selection of a chief executive and hopes to make 
an announcement within the next four weeks. It is reported to have narrowed its search to two candidates - Brendan 
O O'Connor, formerly a senior executive with HSBC, and David Duffy, who has spent most of his career with the 
Dutch bank. ING. - Sunday Times
## The owners of the Montrose Hotel in Dublin are close to offloading it after writing it down in value by almost 80pc 
from its boomtime high. It is understood that a provider of student accommodation is interested in buying the hotel, 
which is close to UCD. A consortium of businessmen paid 40m euros for the hotel in 2006, but is is now valued at 
9m euros, a decline of 77.5pc. - Sunday Business Post. ## Ryanair could face a bill for carbon allowances for up to 
16m euros next year when airlines are due to comply with the EU's emissions trading scheme. A carbon allowance 
permits a company to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These are internationally traded and

The board of Iberia is set to meet this week to consider establishing a new lowcost airline that should help improve 
the Spanish flag carrier's profitability, but could also provoke industrial action.
Iberia, owned by International Airlines Group, has for the past two years been studying the case for creating a low-
cost airline that would assume responsibility for the Spanish flag carrier's short-haul flights.
Sepla, the Spanish pilots union, said it believed Iberia was considering outsourcing many functions related to its 
domestic flights and warned it could consider the case for strike action.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, could therefore be dealing with a second significant bout of industrial action.
Cabin crew at British Airways, also owned by IAG, went on strike last year after the company proposed cutting 
staffing on long-haul flights and the bitter dispute was only resolved in June.
Iberia is battling intense competition from Ryanair and EasyJet, Europe's leading low-cost airlines, on short and 
medium-haul flights, and it is a factor weighing on the Spanish flag carrier's performance.
Iberia reported an operating loss of EUR78m ($104m) in the six months to June 30, while BA recorded a profit of 
EUR210m. The board of Iberia is set to meet on Tuesday, although the airline declined to comment. IAG also 
declined to comment.
The low-cost airline that Iberia has been considering would provide feeder traffic for the Spanish flag carrier's long 
haul flights.
Joe Gill, an analyst at Bloxham, said Iberia's short-haul restructuring might also involve Vueling, the low-cost airline 
in which the Spanish flag carrier has a 46 per cent stake.
Vueling has been operating a limited number of domestic and European flights on behalf of Iberia this year.
Iberia plan for low-cost carrier faces threat of industrial action
Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said IAG and Iberia were keen to push ahead with the 
restructuring of the Spanish flag carrier's short and medium-haul operations.
"We expected this plan to prompt industrial action and we have only been surprised that the process has taken so 
long," he added.
Iberia already has experience of running a low-cost airline.
It set up Clickair in 2006, but it ran up losses and was merged with Vueling in 2009.
Vueling reported revenue of EUR230m for the three months to June 30, and posted an operating profit of EUR4m.

O'Leary: pension deficit hindering sale of Aer Lingus
O'Leary: pension deficit hindering sale of Aer Lingus
Sunday Business Post

Aer Lingus is now worth less than its pension deficit, and this is the single biggest impediment to the sale of the 
government's stake in the airline, according to Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary.
The airline's market capitalisation is around  320million, while the deficit in the airport pension scheme is now as 
much as  620 million, according to one source with knowledge of the situation. This deficit is close to double what 
scheme actuaryMercer valued it at in March.
Aer Lingus claims that it is not liable for extra contributions into the scheme. However, O'Leary has said that Aer 
Lingus will ''roll over'' and fail tostandupto the unionsonthe pension issue. Nevertheless, O'Leary also said that 
Ryanair would still consider buying the government stake in the airline, despite its commitment in recent weeks not 
to bid for it.
''If the Irish government changes its mind, and says it is willing to sell its stake to Ryanair, we would happily bid for 
it," he told The Sunday Business Post. ''But we don't think that is going to happen, so we are happy to discuss 
selling our stake to someone who is willing to buy the government's stake.We are facilitating a sale, but nothing has 
happened."
O'Leary said he did not accept that his original decision to buy a stake in Aer Lingus was a mistake. ''We clearly set 
out our strategy for growing Aer Lingus and making it profitable. The board ofAerLingus and the Irish government 
turned down offers of  2.80 a share five years ago and  1.40 two years ago. Now the share price is 60 cent.We have 
written off about  300 million of our  400 million investment, and we want some of it back," he said.
Echoing the words of Ryanair deputy chief executiveHoward Millar at an Aer Lingus investor day in London last 
week, O'Leary said that the failure byAerLingus to publish a consultant's report into the controversial leave and 
return redundancy scheme was a ''cover-up''.
''We still don't know who on the board of management negotiated this scheme, who approved it, or who paid the  30 
million in shareholders'money to pay off individual employee liabilities," saidO'Leary. ''Nobody has resigned or been 
O'Leary: pension deficit hindering sale of Aer Lingus
sacked, yet  30 million of our money was squandered paying for a tax liability that was not the company's liability. 
We are entitled to know who is to blame for it andwhy nobody has taken any responsibility." O'Leary said he 
believed that the report was being suppressed.
''It is unfair to speculate which individuals should resign, but there is a report that clearly identifies who negotiated, 
approved and implemented it, and who decided to pay  30 million," he said.
''Until we know who those people are, it would be unfair to single anyone out for resignation, but whoever was 
responsible should certainly resign."

Highlight: Airbus' chief operating officer, customers, wants the European export credit agencies to help fund more 
new deliveries in the capital markets as bank liquidity shrinks.
Body
When AerCap issued the first European export credit agency-backed bond last year, it was expected that similar 
deals would follow.
AerCap closed two dollar-denominated ECA bonds in 2010, raising about $225 million to finance three A330s. The 
UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) guaranteed the deal, while Credit Agricole-CIB and Goldman 
Sachs were bookrunners. Read more here. 
But export credit pricing became far more competitive towards the end of 2010 and early 2011, which meant that 
using the capital markets take-out became less attractive.
As bank debt drys up, European export credit debt has risen past Libor plus 100 basis points (bps), and issuing 
export credit bonds is once again on the table. 
"ECA's should not just provide guarantees for bank debt," says John Leahy, chief operating office, customers, 
Airbus,
Leahy says he wants European export credit agencies to help airlines raise cash to finance portfolios of aircraft in 
the capital markets.
The Airbus executive wants to ramp up A320 production to 50 a month in time for the A320neo and to 44 a month 
in 2013.
Airbus says financing for all its deliveries is secured until the end of this year and into early next year. But further 
out than that, the manufacturer needs to ensure customer financing is available.
One French banker says that export credit bonds are more attractive now than six months ago because the bank 
debt market is becoming more expensive.
Leahy calls for more ECA bonds
The ECGD has already guaranteed aircraft bonds, and Coface is also in preliminary discussions, the banker says. 
However, Germany's Euler Hermes is not interested in fronting aircraft bonds, according to the same banker.
He says he could see a bond issuance to finance multiple deliveries for an airline or lessor. The bond might require 
bridge financing supported by the ECAs between deliveries in order to reach a sufficient critical mass for launching 
the bonds.
Earlier this year Ryanair closed a Euro denominated Ex-Im bond which raised &,¬156 million ($222 million). Credit 
Agricole-CIB (CA-CIB) and Goldman Sachs were bookrunners, as for the AerCap bond. Read more here. 
Airfinance Journal understands that Credit Agricole-CIB is in discussions about taking another ECA bond to market.
European export credit agency-backed bonds for Airbus aircraft could be issued in Euros or dollars. The French 
banker expects dollar export credit bonds to be smaller than US Ex-Im bonds.

Pilarski says : Extending the philosophy of overbooking to manufacturers
Pilarski says : Extending the philosophy of overbooking to manufacturers
AirFinance Journal
October 2011
Copyright 2011 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved
Length: 771 words
Highlight: Overbooking is prevalent not only in flights but also in aircraft orders. Just hope you are not the ugly one, 
writes Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president, Avitas, in his monthly column.
Body
We are all familiar with overbooking. Airlines introduced that concept some time ago because they face the problem 
of passengers missing their flights. This may be for a variety of reasons. Connections may be missed because of 
weather delays, technical problems or the new realities of security checks when suspicious activity cause hours of 
delays. Additionally, the old excuse of passengers &(EURO)oeI blew a tyre on my way to the airport and missed my 
flight" are difficult to verify but cannot be ignored.
Airlines had to make a conscious decision about how to treat passengers missing their flights. They could take the 
same approach as organizers of a rock concert: we sold you a ticket, if you do not show up it is your loss. (Of 
course, if I cannot make a rock concert I can give my ticket to somebody else, an option that is not available in 
aviation.)
Or airlines could accept a certain part of the population will miss their flight and adjust to that reality. The decision 
was shaped further by the connecting passengers who would miss flights because of the airline's fault (technical 
delays) or factors clearly outside their control (weather, security scare at airport).
It is not really feasible to have a system where ground personnel can make an assessment as to whether missing a 
flight was the passenger's fault or not. The only airline that has gotten around that problem is Ryanair, where they 
assume everything is the passenger's fault and will charge extra for missing a flight regardless of circumstances.
It turns out that with the advances in computer technology and quantitative methods, airlines are able to predict 
quite accurately the percentage of passengers who will miss a flight. The analysis is conducted by specific time and 
city pairs. Airlines are fairly certain how many people will miss a specific flight, hence they sell more tickets than 
seats are available. This is the origin of overbooking and has served airlines well for years.
In the few cases where the flight is overbooked, airlines will offer volunteers financial compensation plus a seat on 
the next available flight. If not enough volunteers come forward, the airline will resort to &(EURO)oeinvoluntary 
denied boarding", usually selecting the most disposable customers (economy class, not members of frequent-flyer 
programmes, generally ugly, etc).
Manufacturers face a similar problem as airlines. Their customers purchase the product but when the time comes to 
accept they sometimes are not in a position to take delivery. The reasons are different.
Pilarski says : Extending the philosophy of overbooking to manufacturers
It is not weather or technical delays but rather declines in demand or possibility of financial bankruptcy. Or the 
manufacturer may not deliver the product on time. The outcome is the same, however, where a promised sale does 
not materialize at the expected time - and this is occurring at regular and statistically predictable intervals.
Manufacturers abhor producing white tails or any form of speculative manufacturing. On the other hand, they realize 
that a substantial share of orders will not be taken at contract specified times. Some orders will eventually be 
postponed or cancelled. Some analysts will attach a probability to such cancellations and quantify it at, say, 70%.
The situation gets more complicated when looking not at just firm orders but also at options. I remember from my 
Douglas days that a JAL option was considered more solid than a firm order from some other airlines not deemed 
as trustworthy.
So, at present we have a bubble environment with substantial overbooking of aircraft purchases by manufacturers. 
Airbus and Boeing are in a competitive situation where they are sold out for years. Some of the orders they took will 
most likely not materialize or will be substantially delayed.
Conscious overbooking makes sense in certain sales campaigns. But assuming that a certain number of orders will 
not be taken allows the manufacturers to take a statistically supported gamble that these positions will become 
available in a few years and can be offered now to others.
In a similar fashion just like airlines, manufacturers can overbook and take the chances. So what happens if - in the 
not very probable tail of the statistical distribution - there are too many airlines desiring the aircraft sold repeatedly?
Manufacturers will handle it the way airlines do: first approach customers and offer compensation plus the first next 
available aircraft. But if this does not work, they will resort to &(EURO)oeinvoluntary denied deliveries" picking the 
losers to be the least important ones (least amount bought, least likely to buy in future, ugliest, etc).

Highlight: The New York City-based bank may be quiet about its aviation transactions, but it has a large portfolio 
with an experienced team.
Body
Every Monday Apple Bank's banking and investment team, composed of five members, meet to discuss which 
export credit transactions to finance and how to expand their presence in aviation.
The New York bank entered aviation in 2009 as a way to diversify its balance sheet and has gained airline 
customers through word of mouth.
Since then, Apple Bank has financed around 35 aircraft in total. For the last two years, the bank has financed about 
$500 million per year worth of export credit loans.
"We are never going to have a global network of offices," says Jonathan Byron, senior vice president, special 
finance and export credit, Apple Bank. "To the extent that the banks in this sector have a global presence, that is an 
asset for both of us."
Safer than the average bank
Apple Bank has more than two times the average capital of other banks and three times the amount required by 
regulators to be classified as well capitalised. Delinquent loans have remained at near zero throughout the financial 
crisis.
It has financed Airbus and Boeing aircraft - both narrobodies and widebodies - for carriers and lessors in Europe, 
Middle East, North Africa, South America and Asia.
Byron says the bank is comfortable doing a maximum of 12-year loans, but it has also purchased loans with shorter 
maturities in the secondary market. Byron will also consider fixed or floating rate transactions, as well as non-US 
dollar denominated deals.
In addition to export credit agencies, Apple Bank has worked with French banks, like BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole-
CIB, Natixis Transport Finance and Societe Generale, who have been active in export credit transactions.
"We are one of the few banks in the sector that is relatively indifferent as to whether our participation is bilateral or 
new origination," says Byron. "We're happy with either and there are ways to add value to both."
Profile: Apple, the local global bank
While the bank is reserved about revealing its clients, Byron says it has worked with strong commercial credits, 
such as aircraft and engine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and export credit customers like Ryanair and 
Emirates.
It has also closed transactions with five operating lessors. In June Apple Bank partnered with BayernLB to finance a 
sale/leaseback between Jackson Square Aviation (JSA) and Malaysia Airlines for two A330-300s.
"The ECAs have become quite comfortable with lessors as borrowers because they're a good source for the 15% 
portion that is not ECA-guaranteed in transactions," Byron says. "Lessors are also well capitalised and are a good 
source for the residual value exposure of aircraft."
Portfolio 
Apple Bank's portfolio is split about 50/50 between narrowbodies and widebodies. It has financed more Boeing 
aircraft than Airbus and has the most geographical exposure to Europe.
The firm has taken a small participation in an Embraer deal, but Byron says it prefers to do larger aircraft because 
of the size of the transactions. The bank has also purchased part of a deal for an A380 in the secondary market.
When analyzing a deal, Apple Bank looks at both the asset and the credit of the airline. It also considers the 
remarketability of the aircraft.
"We look at both [the asset and the airline credit], but the assets sell themselves anyway and the quality of the 
market is quite strong," says Byron.
"There are a number of strong carriers accessing export credit and we feel the insertion of well-capitalised lessors 
is another risk mitigant."
Higher pricing
While pricing has widened across the whole industry, Byron notes that index rates are at an all time low and as a 
result loans are being financed at attractive rates.
"Even if you have a wider spread, these airlines are accessing loans with coupons in the single digits," he says. 
"Operation income is not going to be impaired by interest expense associated with debt - it may get hit by fuel, 
labour costs, taxes, emissions surcharges or airport fees&but not interest rates."
"This is why operating lessors are interested [in the sector] because at these rates, even with low loan-to-value 
ratios, the leverage looks attractive."
No slow down of ECA
Although the 2011 new Aircraft Sector Understanding will make export credit more expensive, Byron says he does 
not foresee export credit transactions to slow down - especially considering the thousands of deliveries the 
manufacturers are forecasting over the next two decades.
Last year Airbus delivered a record 510 aircraft and the manufacturer expects to deliver between 520 and 530 
aircraft in 2011. Boeing delivered 462 aircraft in 2010 and expects to deliver between 485 and 500 aircraft this year.
"There is a huge replacement demand and additional growth," Byron says. "Apple dollars would not be in the sector 
was it not for export credit - and export credit has to be there for the near term."
Now that the 787 Dreamliner is in production and the A350XWB scheduled to deliver in the next couple of years 
airlines are going to require finance for these widebody deliveries. "These are large ticket aircraft with big orders, so 
I don't expect it to slow down," says Byron.
New products available
Profile: Apple, the local global bank
The bank continues to look for ways it can further participate in aviation, for example by working witin the OEMs, in 
particular when it comes to the supply chain.
"We're also looking at ways that, as a depository institution, we can add value to the sector because we're a good 
home for safe deposits for airlines and other participants in the sector."
Byron says the industry remains buoyant and Apple Bank will continue to provide funding for airline customers as 
long as export credit remains attractive for the bank.
"We have a high expectation of the supply and demand for aircraft so there will continue to be a market out there 
that's significant for us to participate for the next seven to eight years," Byron says.

a new deal with Boeing.
Body
Ryanair is considering an order for 200-300 aircraft delivering between 2015 and 2021, according to a Financial 
times report.
In an interview with the newspaper, Michael O&Leary, chief executive, Ryanair, says that the airline wants cheap 
new aircraft as it plans to increase passenger numbers to 130 million over the next decade.
Ryanair operates an all-Boeing fleet, but has not yet agreed a new deal with Boeing. The airline is reportedly 
negotating with Boeing, Airbus, Comac and Russian manufacturer, Irkut.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst, Deutsche Bank, says that the airline appears to be far from a new deal, judging by 
O'Leary's comments to the Financial Times. The analyst says that Airbus seems unwilling to negotiate, Comac will 
not have a 180-seat aircraft until 2020 and that Boeing does not seem in a mood to offer discounts.
Ryanair plans to pay a &,¬500 million ($693 million) dividend in FY2012/2013. The dividend is being paid because 
the airline has not placed a new order with Boeing. A third dividend is possible in FY2014/2015 if the airline has not 
finalised a new aircraft order by that time.jbullen@euromoneyplc.com

The chief executive of Aer Lingus has expressed misgivings about another airline securing control of the Irish flag-
carrier.
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus' chief executive, said he welcomed a possible ownership change at the company, but 
said he would prefer institutional investors to buy stakes currently held by the Dublin government and Ryanair.
He claimed Aer Lingus' marketing partnerships with other airlines could be jeopardised if it was bought by another 
carrier.
The Irish government announced this month that it was considering selling its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. 
Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, responded by saying it could sell its 29.8 per cent stake in the airline.
Ryanair has failed with two attempted takeovers of Aer Lingus since the company's flotation in 2006, because of 
objections by the Dublin government and European competition authorities. Analysts suggested the most likely 
buyer of the Irish flag-carrier was International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia.
Mr Mueller said the Irish government and Ryanair could sell their stakes to institutional investors.
"There is enough demand in the market to place the shares," he told the FT.

The ISEQ's rally above the 2,500 mark faded this morning in line with world markets and amid increased fears of a 
global economic slowdown.
By 12:30, the index had fallen 29.11 points to 2,482.70.
World stocks fell with European shares on track to mark their biggest quarterly loss since the collapse of Lehman 
Bros three years ago as European economic readings compounded pessimism over global growth. U.S. stock index 
futures pointed to a weaker open for Wall Street, with futures down over 1 percent. The euro slipped, on course for 
its biggest monthly drop in nearly a year, weighed down by the lack of visible solution to the euro zone's deepening 
debt woes. The boost to the euro generated by Germany's parliamentary approval for new powers to the European 
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) proved fleeting after data showing German retail sales slumping at their fastest 
pace in more than four years in August.
La Brea bakery, a subsidiary of Aryzta which is ranked as the ninth-largest fresh bread brand in the US, grew unit 
sales volumes by 3.87pc for the 12 months ended August 7th last. It was the second-fastest growing brand in the 
fresh bread category in the period. Only five of the top brands recorded a year-on-year (yoy) rise in unit sales, while 
the overall fresh bread market declined by 3.3pc yoy over the period. Even private-label fresh bread unit sales fell 
by 3.72pc. Big falls were recorded by some leading brands, for example Pepperidge Farm -13.1pc and Sara Lee 
Soft and Smooth -35pc. The average retail price per unit of La Brea bread rose by 1.3pc, a relatively low rate of 
increase within the category. The data, based on Infoscan reviews from SymphonyIRI Group, are reported in the 
latest issue of Milling and Baking News. Shares in the Irish-Swiss bakers plunged 99c to E32.02. Ryanair has 
extended its fuel hedges further into 2013, according to Davy Research. From being only 20pc hedged for its Q1 
2013, Ryanair has now extended its hedges, taking advantage of hedging weakness, as shown in its AGM 
presentation. It is now 57pc hedged at an average of dollar 999 per metric tonne; this breaks down 75pc hedged in

Q1 and 50pc in each of the remaining quarters, Q2-Q4. This compares with being 90pc hedged in 2012 at dollar

The ISEQ's rally above the 2,500 mark faded this morning in line with world markets and amid increased fears of a 
global economic slowdown.
By 12:30, the index had fallen 29.11 points to 2,482.70.
World stocks fell with European shares on track to mark their biggest quarterly loss since the collapse of Lehman 
Bros three years ago as European economic readings compounded pessimism over global growth. U.S. stock index 
futures pointed to a weaker open for Wall Street, with futures down over 1 percent. The euro slipped, on course for 
its biggest monthly drop in nearly a year, weighed down by the lack of visible solution to the euro zone's deepening 
debt woes. The boost to the euro generated by Germany's parliamentary approval for new powers to the European 
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) proved fleeting after data showing German retail sales slumping at their fastest 
pace in more than four years in August.
La Brea bakery, a subsidiary of Aryzta which is ranked as the ninth-largest fresh bread brand in the US, grew unit 
sales volumes by 3.87pc for the 12 months ended August 7th last. It was the second-fastest growing brand in the 
fresh bread category in the period. Only five of the top brands recorded a year-on-year (yoy) rise in unit sales, while 
the overall fresh bread market declined by 3.3pc yoy over the period. Even private-label fresh bread unit sales fell 
by 3.72pc. Big falls were recorded by some leading brands, for example Pepperidge Farm -13.1pc and Sara Lee

British Airways is the most likely buyer of the government's 25pc stake in Aer Lingus, according to Ryanair.
BA, which formed the International Airlines Group when it merged with Spain's Iberia last year, has not expressed 
interest in buying the Aer Lingus stake, which the government is considering selling.
"It is far more likely that there will be a trade buyer. I think the obvious trade buyer would be BA or IAG," Ryanair 
CEO Michael O'Leary told journalists at the company's annual general meeting.
Earlier this week, Aer Lingus warned the government against selling its stake to a larger rival, saying this could 
undermine its business model by damaging current partnerships and driving up costs. O'Leary, whose company 
owns 29 pc of Aer Lingus, said the stake could sell at up to 1 euro per share, a strong premium over the current 
price of 68 cents per share. Ryanair says it will consider selling its 29 pc stake if it can secure a good price. The 
main stumbling block to a sale is a deficit at an Aer Lingus' employee pension fund, which at over 400m euros is 
larger than the company's market capitalisation of around 340m euros, he said. "I think Aer Lingus' share price 
could go to 1 euro per share if they took the simple measure of closing out the uncertainty on the pension scheme," 
he said. Aer Lingus management has said it has legal advice that it is not liable to make up the deficit, but O'Leary 
said investors remained nervous as the company's board of directors had not made a clear statement on the issue.

The ISEQ closed the week on a low and the quarter with the worst performance since 2008 in line with world 
markets and amid increased fears of a global economic slowdown.
The euro fell 1pc against the US dollar and the Yen as European shares posted their worst performance since the 
calamitous fall of Lehman Brothers as concerns have grown that global growth was stalling, with weak China 
manufacturing data the latest piece of evidence to suggest a slowdown.
The torrid quarterly performance had also been hit by concerns about the euro zone sovereign debt crisis, with 
policymakers still yet to come up a suitable plan to ease the situation.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares provisionally closed down 1.6 percent at 918.44 points and 
had lost 17.3 percent for the quarter its worst since the end of 2008. La Brea bakery, a subsidiary of Aryzta which is 
ranked as the ninth-largest fresh bread brand in the US, grew unit sales volumes by 3.87pc for the 12 months

Ryanair shrugs off new airline strategy
Body
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of EasyJet, will find it hard to repeat his feat of creating one of Europe's leading 
airlines, Ryanair said on Thursday.
EasyJet surprised the aviation industry on Monday by saying that Sir Stelios had told the company that he intended 
setting up a new airline called Fastjet . A website with the address fastjet.com has already been established.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, told the company's annual meeting in Dublin that Sir Stelios would find it 
tougher this time compared to when he set up EasyJet.
"If he were to set up an airline in Europe this time around it would be much more difficult now because Ryanair is 
much larger than when he set up EasyJet and EasyJet is much larger," Mr O'Leary said. "All he has done so far is 
set up one page on the internet. I wouldn't hold my breath."
Mr O'Leary became chief executive of Ryanair in 1994, one year before Sir Stelios set up EasyJet. The two 
companies became close rivals, both pursuing the same low-cost business model and offering cheap flights 
between European destinations.
Ryanair is today Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue, followed by EasyJet.
Sir Stelios stepped down as EasyJet's chairman in 2002, but his family is the company's largest shareholder, with a 
38 per cent stake. He has been locked in an acrimonious dispute with EasyJet over strategy for the past three 
years, calling for the company to pay dividends and curb its fleet expansion.
This month, EasyJet said it would pay its first ever dividends next year , worth £190m, and shortly afterwards Sir 
Stelios dropped his latest attempt to shake up the board by removing a director.
EasyJet founder's plan questioned
However, he shocked EasyJet on Saturday by sending an email to Sir Michael Rake, the chairman, saying he 
intended to set up a new airline. Sir Stelios has declined to provide further details, and did not comment on Mr 
O'Leary's comments.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, EasyJet's broker, said it would be difficult for a new venture by Sir Stelios to 
succeed compared with 10 years ago, when low-cost airlines had the opportunity to grab market share from flag 
carriers on short-haul routes.
"EasyJet, and indeed Ryanair, have major strategic advantages over other low-cost airlines, including very cheap 
aircraft [and] widely known pan-European brands," he added.

RYANAIR boss Michael Leary is known for his strong opinions - and yesterday he let Colm Barrington, the 
chairman of Aer Lingus, know exactly what he thinks of the airline Ryanair holds a 29 per cent stake in.
"Dear Colm," began O'Leary in his open letter to the London Stock Exchange. "Your claim that the board and 
management are fully dedicated to creating value for Aer Lingus is unsupported by any evidence...
over the past five years."
He has plenty of points to prove the opposite, though - ten of them, in fact, including the airline's 12 changes of 
chief executive in 18 years and the rejection of two takeover offers. Unless things improve, expect O'Leary's Aer 
Lingus shares to be offloaded fairly soon…

MICHAEL O'Leary, the chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, yesterday stepped up his attacks on Ireland's 
national carrier Aer Lingus.
He called for the company to pay a special dividend to give them value for their investments.
In an open letter to the airline's management, Ryanair - which owns 30 per cent of Aer Lingus - ridiculed a recent 
statement from the firm in which it said its objective was to "build durable value" for its shareholders.
The letter said: "You reported cumulative losses of (EURO)154m (£133.8m) and exceptional provisions of almost 
(EURO)400m.
"You opened Belfast and Gatwick bases, only to later largely close them. You opened long-haul routes to San 
Francisco, Washington, Los Angeles and Dubai, only later to close them.
"Shareholders have no confidence in your claim that 'our objective is to build durable value' when almost all of your 
initiatives over the past five years have destroyed shareholder value."
Ryanair has repeatedly tried to buy a larger stake in the Irish airline, but has always been rebuffed.
BA has been tipped as the most likely buyer of the Irish government's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.

the staff redundancy tax debacle and demanding a "special dividend" for shareholders.
In an open letter to Aer Lingus, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said that Aer Lingus's market cap has declined to 
E320m from E1.5bn.
He said the company has rejected two takeover approaches from Ryanair, one at E2.80 a share in 2007 and one at 
E1.40 in 2009; and that Aer Lingus closed its Shannon Airport base only to reopen it and opened Belfast and 
Gatwick bases only to later largely close them.
He said that, with a market cap of E320m and net cash of E350m, "the market attributes a value of less than zero to 
Aer Lingus under its current management". He also hit out at the board's claim that Ryanair's holding (of 30pc) in its 
rival is damaging for Aer Lingus. Mr O'Leary claimed that, under the current board, E30m of shareholder funds have 
been misused through tax liabilities that were individual and not an Aer Lingus obligation. He also called on the 
board to seek shareholder views on the possibility of a E0.20 special dividend, which would result in a total payout 
of about E110m. "Given your Board's failure to distinguish what creates shareholder value, we have asked you to 
canvass the views of all shareholders about a possible special dividend of E0.20 per share (approx E110m) in 
2011. With gross cash of over E919m and net cash of over E350m and no significant cap ex until at least 2018, 
such a payment can be readily funded from your excessive and inefficient cash balances, and a E0.20 one off 
dividend would significantly enhance shareholder value (and the possible sale of the Govt's 25pc shareholding) 
given that your share price currently languishes at some E0.60 per share," said Mr O'Leary. The call for a special 
dividend is strangely similar to one made by Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder and major shareholder in Ryanair's 
rival in the UK, easyJet. He successfully called on easyJet to pay a special dividend, which netted his holding 
company £72m.

The ISEQ failed to get a lift from the German parliament's approval of new powers for the euro zone's rescue fund 
that eased concerns that deep political divisions are hampering efforts to end the debt crisis.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 11.98 points to 2,489.73.
The German parliament backed more powers for the euro zone rescue fund with a large majority in what was 
Chancellor Angela Merkel's biggest test since she took power six years ago. A leading conservative lawmaker also 
said the bill had passed without the need of support from the opposition, easing worries of a rebellion against 
Merkel within the ruling coalition that could weaken her politically. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 
shares was up 0.3 percent at 930.14 points after falling 1.2 percent in the previous session. World stocks as 
measured by the MSCI index were 0.2 percent higher. The euro was up 0.6 percent to around dollar 1.3630, having 
risen to as high as dollar 1.3678 on the news that the bill was passed. "Beyond this vote nothing has changed and 
we're awaiting a more comprehensive response from euro zone policymakers," said Lee Hardman, currency analyst 
at BTM-UFJ. "The relief rally in the euro over the past week has been built on unsustainable foundations."
Shares in Aer Lingus were unmoved at E0.65. Davy noted comments regarding the peak summer period (July-
August) said that that yields were up 4.6pc, ancillary revenues per passenger up 5.1pc and passenger volumes up 
1.4pc are positive, particularly given the weighting to the peak season (the IMS on Q3 results will issue on 
November 3rd). We know from the investor day that ancillary revenue seems to performing well, while the 
'Greenfield' initiatives to achieve E97m in cost savings by FY 2012 are continuing and we would expect revenue 
growth to be volume-led rather than yield-led towards the back end of the year. "We will leave our E34.1m 
operating forecast unchanged, albeit there is likely an upward bias," said Davy. Shares in Ryanair, who delivered a 
blistering attack on Aer Lingus management demanding a "special" dividend of E0.20, were up 3c to E3.29. 
Grafton's shares rose 3c to E2.70. Irish hardware, paints and glass volumes were 6.4pc lower in August on a 
ISEQ fails to gain from German vote ISEQ Falls
seasonally adjusted basis compared to August last year. For the June to August quarter, volumes were 7.3pc down 
year-on-year. This component of the retail sales index offers a decent insight into the trading context for Grafton's 
Irish retail division. This division accounts for c.11-12pc of Grafton's overall revenues. Nationwide has added to the 
flow of negative sentiment towards the UK housing market, when it reported that in September average house 
prices increased by only 0.1pc year-on-year. The outlook for the market remains very weak, with economic fears 
and the lack of mortgage availability continuing to weigh on sentiment. Shares in Kingspan fell 8c to E6.05.

shares was up 0.3 percent at 930.14 points after falling 1.2 percent in the previous session. World stocks as 
measured by the MSCI index were 0.2 percent higher. The euro was up 0.6 percent to around dollar 1.3630, having 
risen to as high as dollar 1.3678 on the news that the bill was passed. "Beyond this vote nothing has changed and 
we're awaiting a more comprehensive response from euro zone policymakers," said Lee Hardman, currency analyst 
at BTM-UFJ.
Shares in Aer Lingus were up 2c at E0.67. Davy noted comments regarding the peak summer period (July-August) 
said that that yields were up 4.6pc, ancillary revenues per passenger up 5.1pc and passenger volumes up 1.4pc 
are positive, particularly given the weighting to the peak season (the statement on Q3 results will issue on 
November 3rd). "We know from the investor day that ancillary revenue seems to performing well, while the 
'Greenfield' initiatives to achieve E97m in cost savings by 2012 are continuing and we would expect revenue growth 
to be volume-led rather than yield-led towards the back end of the year. We will leave our E34.1m operating 
forecast unchanged, albeit there is likely an upward bias," said Davy. Shares in Ryanair, who delivered a blistering 
ISEQ edges higher after German vote ISEQ Up
attack on Aer Lingus management and demanded a "special" dividend of E0.20, were up 2c to E3.28. Grafton's 
shares fell 2c to E2.66. Irish hardware, paints and glass volumes were 6.4pc lower in August on a seasonally 
adjusted basis compared to August last year. For the June to August quarter, volumes were 7.3pc down year-on-
year. This component of the retail sales index offers a decent insight into the trading context for Grafton's Irish retail 
division. This division accounts for c.11-12pc of Grafton's overall revenues. Nationwide has added to the flow of 
negative sentiment towards the UK housing market, when it reported that in September average house prices 
increased by only 0.1pc year-on-year. The outlook for the market remains very weak, with economic fears and the 
lack of mortgage availability continuing to weigh on sentiment. Shares in Kingspan rose 2c to E6.15. At a time when 
credit ratings for many building material companies are under pressure, it is of note that Fitch has reaffirmed CRH 
at BBB, with a stable outlook. Furthermore, it believes CRH has "meaningful flexibility to undertake further 
acquisitions in terms of leverage capacity at the current rating". Shares in the Irish construction materials giant rose 
20c to E11.73.

The ISEQ lost ground today as profit takers descended though losses were limited after the EU confirmed 
negotiators would return to Greece this week to discuss issuing its next tranche of aid.
The index fell 18.60 points to 2,501.71.
Caution ahead of an audit of Greece's finances drove major world stock markets lower, while prices of commodities 
like oil and copper fell. Following its best day in a year and a half, an index of world stocks dropped as investors 
awaited news on whether Greece will be allowed another round of aid in order to avoid a default. The focus was 
also on whether European leaders could agree on an enlarged bailout fund to help other debt-laden nations in the 
region. The European Union confirmed negotiators would return to Greece this week to discuss issuing its next 
tranche of aid. U.S. stocks turned mostly lower after opening higher.
Shares in Irish cider maker, C and C, were down 8c at E2.83. Recent commentary from UK consumer stocks, 
anecdotal evidence in the market and the continued tough environment in Ireland have convinced us to err on the 
side of caution and move Davy's EBIT (profit) estimate for this year (E115m) from the top of management's 
guidance range to the middle of the range (E111.5m). Management's range is for EBIT of between E108 and 
E115m. "The driving factors of our more cautious stance are a weaker GB on-trade market environment and 
continued price deflation and weak volumes in the Irish drinks market," the broker said. Aer Lingus has released 
latest traffic figures. Overall, the company is performing positively on yields and volume. Yield per passenger for 
July and August increased by 4.6pc compared to the prior year. Passenger volumes for July and August 2011 were 
up by 1.4pc compared to the same period in 2010. Year-to-date passenger yields are 7.1pc ahead of the prior year 
while year-to-date passenger volumes have now stabilised compared to the same period in 2010. Ancillary revenue 
per passenger increased by 5.1pc compared to the same period in 2010 and is now in line with 2010 on a year-to-
date basis. This revenue performance, combined with the ongoing benefits of the Greenfield cost reduction

programme, meant that Aer Lingus traded ahead of the prior year in July and August. Yields and volumes in 
September are also ahead of the prior year. Shares in the airline were flat at E0.65 while Ryanair was down 2c to 
E3.26. Reports indicate that Bank of Ireland is in the final stages of raising around Stg£1bn in term funding. 
Indications are that it will be a similar deal to that executed on July 22, when the company raised about E2.9bn with 
a weighted average duration of 2.2 years at a spread of 265 basis points over 3 month Euribor using part of its UK 
residential Mortgage book as collateral. While the bank will continue to pay a premium in the near term, it would still 
be a positive step in the bank's return to normalised funding. Shares in the bank were unmoved at E0.08.

Body
Aer lingus today warned the government against selling its 25pc stake to a larger rival, saying this could undermine 
its business model by damaging current partnerships and driving up costs.
Transport Minister Leo Varadkar was quoted as saying last week that the government had received expressions of 
interest from airlines and investment firms in its 25 percent stake in the former state carrier.
In a meeting with investors and analysts, CEO Christoph Mueller indicated that the airline would prefer a sale to an 
institutional investor as it would allow it to remain outside the major alliances and maintain a series of bilateral 
deals.
"We make money on our neutrality. When the government stake is discussed ... before we jump to the conclusion 
of a trade buyer we should be very careful," Mueller told a meeting with investors broadcast on its web site. 
"Neutrality is a big bottom-line contributor for carriers of our nature," he said. Mueller also said most potential trade 
buyers he could see had higher costs bases, which he warned could "infect" Aer Lingus and drive up costs. Aer 
Lingus' Irish rival Ryanair , Europe's largest budget airline, has twice had takeover bids for Aer Lingus rebuffed and 
it has said it would be prepared to sell its 30 percent stake, opening the way for another airline to take majority 
control. No major airline has publically expressed interest in the stakes. Aer Lingus also issued a positive trading 
statement today, saying that yields and passenger volumes rose in the busy summer holiday months of July and 
August and that trend had continued into September. Passenger volumes were up 1.4 percent in the two months 
from a year earlier, while yields - the keenly watched measure showing average revenue gained per mile per 
passenger - rose 4.6 percent. Aer Lingus said in August that strong bookings for the second half of 2011 meant it 
would recover from a first-half loss to post a full-year operating profit. Ancillary revenue per passenger - charges for 
services like checking bags - increased by 5.1 percent compared with the same period last year and was now in 
line with 2010 on a year-to-date basis. Several analysts said this was ahead of their expectations. The airline

expects single-digit growth in ancillaries next year, Chief Commercial Officer Stephen Kavanagh told investors. The 
Irish government has not yet decided whether to sell its 25 percent stake, but it has hinted it is open to a sale if the 
offer is right. Once a review later this year provides clarity on a large deficit in a pension scheme for Aer Lingus 
employees, the number of interested parties will likely increase, Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said. Concerns 
that Aer Lingus may have to contribute to cover a 400 million euros deficit in the fund has weighed on its share 
price in recent months.

Fastjet start-up could leave EasyJet feeling queasy

Never a dull moment for Carolyn McCall, chief executive of EasyJet, which is 38 per cent owned by founder Sir 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his family. The low-cost European airline said in a Stock Exchange statement on Monday 
that Sir Stelios has notified it of his plans to set up another airline, Fastjet .
On Friday the serial entrepreneur dropped an attempt to oust EasyJet non-executive director Rigas Doganis. Ms 
McCall had been confident of defeating the challenge. But the score line looked like a draw when you considered 
that earlier in the week EasyJet announced plans to pay ordinary and special dividends totalling £190m. Sir Stelios 
has long campaigned for pay-outs to shareholders.
Where detail is lacking, supposition may fill the gaps. So it would be a mistake to read too much into the 
appearance in cyberspace of a crimson webpage announcing "Fastjet.com by Stelios. Coming soon!"
We do not know whether Fastjet would compete head-on with EasyJet, whose brand Sir Stelios has committed to 
enhancing. It would be an odd move for the Greek Cypriot entrepreneur to create a venture that cannibalised the 
revenues of a business in which he and his family are the dominant shareholders. However, some overlap appears 
possible. In a brief statement alleging "a smear campaign" by EasyJet, he said that he had "terminated" the effect of 
a comfort letter that he sent to EasyJet last year. Its provisions included an undertaking not to acquire an interest in 
an airline licensed by a country in the European Economic Area or by Switzerland.
Other shareholders - and Ms McCall - can therefore be forgiven any queasiness they feel at the advent of Fastjet. 
Sir Stelios revolutionised the European airline industry in the nineties, pioneering a low-cost model previously 
deployed in the US by carriers such as Southwest Airlines. It is questionable whether he could shake up the 
industry again, given that EasyJet and Ryanair have plucked so much of the low-hanging fruit. But you would be 
brave to bet against him.

Dublin shares have made an uncertain start this morning, bouncing back from initial losses.
The volatile mode reflected similar uncertainty across Europe, where indices also started negative but quickly 
recovered.
Doubts over the determination of Europe to forge a new plan to overcome its debt plans are fuelling nervousness 
among investors.
The ISEQ index was 14.54 points ahead a short time ago at 2,419.28, reversing a 16 point early fall. In Europe, the 
Dax index is up 1pc in Frankfurt anbd the CAC-40 is ahead by 0.54pc in Paris, both having opened lower. In Dublin, 
most big names are ahead. CRH has gained 11c to 1078, DCC is up 6c to 1796, Elan is 11c higher at 716 and 
Ryanair has surged by 10c to 330. Smurfit Kappa is down 6c at 442.

Dublin shares have made an uncertain start this morning, bouncing back from initial losses.
The volatile mode reflected similar uncertainty across Europe, where indices also started negative but quickly 
recovered.
Doubts over the determination of Europe to forge a new plan to overcome its debt plans are fuelling nervousness 
among investors.
The ISEQ index was 14.54 points ahead a short time ago at 2,419.28, reversing a 16 point early fall. In Europe, the 
Dax index is up 1pc in Frankfurt anbd the CAC-40 is ahead by 0.54pc in Paris, both having opened lower. In Dublin, 
most big names are ahead. CRH has gained 11c to 1078, DCC is up 6c to 1796, Elan is 11c higher at 716 and

Credit card spending slows

Credit cards have fallen out of favour with British shoppers, as consumers eschew high interest rates in favour of 
debit cards.
Some 40 years after they were introduced, credit cards have suffered a reversal in popularity after years of growth.
Figures from the UK Cards Association, passed to the Financial Times, reveal that debit cards outnumber credit 
cards, indicating a big change in consumer attitudes to spending and borrowing during the past decade.
Between 2000 and 2005 credit card use in the UK accelerated, as high consumer appetite for borrowing and fierce 
competition from providers drove up demand. The number of cards in this period rose from 47m to 70m.
But in the middle of the decade borrowers re-thought their spending habits, and reduced their credit card use years 
before the credit crisis came along.
Paul Rodford, head of card payments at the UK Card Association, said no single factor could explain the falling 
popularity of credit cards. The change, he insisted, had been led by consumers rather than regulatory change.
"This was not some sixth sense anticipation of the crisis to come, but rather a variety of things," Mr Rodford said. 
"By 2005 the market was saturated, and there was an increase in negative coverage from the media surrounding 
debt and the costs associated with credit cards.
"There was also an increase in home equity release , which let individuals use their mortgages to borrow on."
By the end of the decade the number of credit cards in the UK fell to 55.6m, and outstanding balances were £10bn 
lower.
Banking customers have turned to debit cards. Spending on debit cards doubled in the five years to 2010. By 2010 
some 84m cards were in circulation in the UK.
Credit card spending slows
Those consumers who still use credit cards have become more cautious about outstanding debts. Last year almost 
two-thirds of borrowers paid off the full sum owned each month, compared with about half in 2005.
Providers appear to have reacted to the changing customer spending habits by raising costs for credit cards.
The Co-operative Bank, Sainsbury's and Santander charge monthly fees for some of their credit cards, and other 
providers have introduced fees that penalise low usage.
A recently launched prepay Ryanair-branded MasterCard will levy a fee of £2.50 if the card is not used for six 
months.

Travellers who use a new Ryanair-branded pre-paid credit card will be able to reclaim the airline's online booking 
fees - but will be charged for other purchases made on the card, and will not receive the level of protection offered 
by other credit cards.
The budget carrier is believed to be included in an ongoing investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into 
surcharges by airlines for card payments. However, chief executive Michael O'Leary has announced that the airline 
will continue to apply its £6 "administration fee" to all passengers who pay for flights using cards other than the 
Ryanair Cash Passport card.
Booking charges will still be added to the bills of customers using the card, but cardholders will then receive a 
voucher equal to the sum they paid in charges, which can be redeemed on future Ryanair bookings. However, the 
card itself carries a number of additional fees.
It costs £6 to buy, and charges a £2 fee for withdrawing cash at ATMs and a 50p charge for all other card 
transactions except Ryanair bookings - plus an inactivity fee of £2.50 if the card is not used in six months.
Airline ticket buyers are estimated to have spent £300m on booking fees last year and airlines including EasyJet 
and Lufthansa's BMI are being investigated by the Office of Fair Trading over surcharges for accepting debit and 
credit card payments.
Since the OFT investigation began, one carrier, Monarch, announced that it would remove its debit card fee and cut 
credit card charges. But other airlines reacted more aggressively. EasyJet increased its fees for debit cards from 
£5.50 to £8, and raised credit card fees from £8 to £12.95 in April. Ryanair charges £6 per person, per flight, for all 
bookings made.
Critics have pointed out that the fees do not fairly represent costs incurred by airlines.
Processing debit cards typically costs less than 50p, and credit cards between £2 and £3.
Ryanair credit card fees warning
In the past, Ryanair allowed customers to avoid booking fees by using an Electron card. This was then changed to 
a prepaid MasterCard, and will now be limited to the Ryanair Cash Passport card.
Ryanair fares are expected to rise by 12 per cent this year.

Aer Lingus rejects Ryanair 's pay-out call

Aer Lingus has rejected calls by Ryanair, its largest shareholder, for the Irish flag-carrier to pay a special dividend.
Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus chairman, has told Ryanair that the carrier's board is sticking by its view of May's 
annual meeting that a dividend should be considered once a "more durable" economic recovery is apparent.
However, Mr Barrington welcomed Ryanair's statement this month that it could be willing to sell its 29.8 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus and Ryanair have been locked in a fractious relationship since Europe's largest low-cost airline by 
revenue launched the first of two failed takeover bids in 2006. Both bids faltered after objections by the Irish 
government and European competition authorities.
In a letter to Mr Barrington, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, this month called for the payment of a special 
dividend by Aer Lingus because it had gross cash of more than EUR900m (£789m).
Aer Lingus has not paid a dividend since its flotation in 2006, and in a letter to Mr O'Leary sent on Thursday, Mr 
Barrington said: "At the time of the AGM we stated that 'the board continues to evaluate the respective merits of 
balance sheet strength and payment of a dividend to shareholders. The board believes that it is in the best interests 
of all shareholders to consider a dividend when there is a more durable recovery and consequent earnings 
visibility'. This remains our position."
He added that the board had already told Ryanair it had "no right to force Aer Lingus to accede to demands 
regarding the payment of a dividend".
Mr O'Leary had also sought assurances that the company would not increase its contributions into a pension 
scheme jointly sponsored by Aer Lingus without prior shareholder approval.
Aer Lingus rejects Ryanair 's pay-out call
The company said at its half-year results last month that there was an estimated actuarial deficit of EUR400m in 
one pension scheme involving Aer Lingus.
The company added it believed it had no responsibility for the deficit, but said its view might be challenged in the 
courts.
Mr Barrington said the board had the power to determine what payments were made into the pension schemes it 
was involved in.
He added Aer Lingus had "met all its obligations" to the pension schemes, but was working with trustees and 
employee groups to try to find solutions to outstanding issues.
Ryanair said it would respond to Mr Barrington's letter in due course.
Aer Lingus faces a possible change of ownership after the Irish government said this month it was willing to sell its 
25 per cent stake in the carrier. It added it did not want Ryanair to buy its stake.

IRELAND'S Aer Lingus has written to its shareholder and rival Ryanair to reject the latter's complaints that it is 
"continually ignored" by the Aer Lingus board.
In a letter sent to Ryanair and released yesterday, Aer Lingus said Ryanair was a source of concern to other 
investors and welcomed its recent statement that it would be prepared to sell its 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus if 
the government found a buyer for the state's 25 per cent holding.
"One of the greatest concerns that we hear from shareholders relates to Ryanair's shareholding in the company and 
its impact on the company's options and value," chairman Colm Barrington wrote in the letter.
"As such, we welcome your recent statements that Ryanair would be prepared to dispose of its shareholding in Aer 
Lingus.
"We would hope to have constructive discussions with you on this issue."
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, has twice had takeover bids for Aer Lingus rebuffed and its outspoken 
chief executive Michael O'Leary has been a long-standing critic of the company.

The main Dublin shares index tumbled this morning in line with global markets as investors bailed out of equities for 
safer havens amid fears over the possibility of a new global downturn.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen 84.05 points to 2,360.47.
A grim outlook for the U.S. economy from the Federal Reserve and signs of a slowing in China and Germany sent 
world stocks tumbling today. European stocks fell more than 4 percent to a two-year low, helping drag global 
equities to a fresh one-year low. Wall Street looked set for sharp losses at the start. The Fed set the ball rolling on 
Wednesday when it launched "Operation Twist", a plan to lower borrowing costs by selling or not renewing short-
term debt in favour of longer bonds. The move was expected, but the Fed's statement of the rationale behind it was 
stark. There were "significant downside risks" to the U.S. economy, it said. Concern was increased when HSBC's 
China Flash PMI showed the factory sector shrank for the third consecutive month in September, pointing to a 
slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. Meanwhile, business activity in Germany also grew at its weakest 
pace in more than two years in September and new orders fell for a third month.
Food firm, Origin Enterprises delivered a 16.3pc rise in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for its full year, 2011. In 
what was a very active year of repositioning, Origin Enterprises traded very successfully. Adjusted EPS rose by 
16.3pc to 43.34c (beating Davy's forecast of 41.4c). Acquisitions played their part in this, but underlying operating 
profit growth was robust at 8.2pc despite a year-on-year (yoy) weaker Irish market as regards volume feed 
ingredients and fertiliser. Agri-services activity grew revenues by 16.8pc and EBITA by 29.2pc. Acquired 
businesses in agronomy services offset the impact of reduced revenue from activities that moved to associate 
status in the year. This switch had the effect of boosting the after-tax contribution of associates and joint ventures 
by 28.4pc. Shares in the group fell 7c to E3.32. EasyJet has (for the second time) brought forward a pre-close 
statement and has raised full year guidance to pre-tax profits of £240-250m. "Overall, this is a very positive

commentary from easyJet. The dividend is in line with our expectations, and we retain our 'outperform' rating and 
475p price target. We will look at our forecasts accordingly, with some revising up for 2011 (we are at profits of 
219.6m)," said Davy's Stephen Furlong. Shares in Ryanair fell 4c to E2.95. The Minister for Justice Alan Shatter 
has announced in a statement that the Government is to start work on modernising laws on gambling in Ireland. It 
mainly relates to the area of gaming (excluding sports betting), where legislation has been out of date for a long 
time. "In terms of the impact to Paddy Power our forecasts already assume that its Irish online businesses will have 
to pay 1pc turnover tax from July 2011 onwards. In regards to online gaming, we estimate that around 25pc of 
Paddy Power's 2011 online gaming gross win (about E18.1m) came from Irish customers," said Goodbody's 
analyst, Gavin Kelleher. Shares in the Irish bookies, Paddy Power, plunged by E1.20 each to E36.55.

The main Dublin shares index tumbled today in line with global markets as investors bailed out of equities for safer 
havens amid fears over the possibility of a new global downturn.
The index fell 78.39 points to 2,366.13.
A grim outlook for the U.S. economy from the Federal Reserve and signs of a slowing in China and Germany sent 
world stocks tumbling today. European stocks fell more than 4pc to a two-year low, helping drag global equities to a 
fresh one-year low. Wall Street looked set for sharp losses at the start. The Fed set the ball rolling on Wednesday 
when it launched "Operation Twist", a plan to lower borrowing costs by selling or not renewing short-term debt in 
favour of longer bonds. The move was expected, but the Fed's statement of the rationale behind it was stark. There 
were "significant downside risks" to the U.S. economy, it said. Concern was increased when HSBC's China Flash 
PMI showed the factory sector shrank for the third consecutive month in September, pointing to a slowdown in the 
world's second-largest economy. Meanwhile, business activity in Germany also grew at its weakest pace in more 
than two years in September and new orders fell for a third month.
Food firm, Origin Enterprises delivered a 16.3pc rise in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for its full year, 2011. In 
what was a very active year of repositioning, Origin Enterprises traded very successfully. Adjusted EPS rose by 
16.3pc to 43.34c (beating Davy's forecast of 41.4c). Acquisitions played their part in this, but underlying operating 
profit growth was robust at 8.2pc despite a year-on-year (yoy) weaker Irish market as regards volume feed 
ingredients and fertiliser. Agri-services activity grew revenues by 16.8pc and EBITA by 29.2pc. Acquired 
businesses in agronomy services offset the impact of reduced revenue from activities that moved to associate 
status in the year. This switch had the effect of boosting the after-tax contribution of associates and joint ventures 
by 28.4pc. Shares in the group fell 4c to E3.35. EasyJet has (for the second time) brought forward a pre-close 
statement and has raised full year guidance to pre-tax profits of £240-250m. "Overall, this is a very positive

commentary from easyJet. The dividend is in line with our expectations, and we retain our 'outperform' rating and 
475p price target. We will look at our forecasts accordingly, with some revising up for 2011 (we are at profits of 
219.6m)," said Davy's Stephen Furlong. Shares in Ryanair fell 1c to E2.98. The Minister for Justice Alan Shatter 
has announced in a statement that the Government is to start work on modernising laws on gambling in Ireland. It 
mainly relates to the area of gaming (excluding sports betting), where legislation has been out of date for a long 
time. "In terms of the impact to Paddy Power our forecasts already assume that its Irish online businesses will have 
to pay 1pc turnover tax from July 2011 onwards. In regards to online gaming, we estimate that around 25pc of

Body
Aer Lingus has written to shareholder and long-time rival Ryanair to reject the latter's complaints that it is 
"continually ignored" by the Aer Lingus board, the latest in a long-running war of words between the two airlines.
In a letter sent to Ryanair and released today, Aer Lingus said Ryanair was a source of concern to other investors 
and welcomed its recent statement that it would be prepared to sell its 30pc stake in Aer Lingus if the government 
found a buyer for the state's 25pc holding.
"One of the greatest concerns that we hear from shareholders relates to Ryanair's shareholding in the company and 
its impact on the company's options and value. As such, we welcome your recent statements that Ryanair would be 
prepared to dispose of its shareholding in Aer Lingus," Chairman Colm Barrington wrote in the letter.
"We would hope to have constructive discussions with you on this issue." Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, 
has twice had takeover bids for Aer Lingus rebuffed and its outspoken Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has been a 
long-standing critic of the company. In recent public statements, Ryanair complained about Aer Lingus's handling of 
a E400 million pension deficit, which has depressed the company's share price, as well as the absence of a 
dividend payment and decision to buy out a profit share deal with employees. The government is considering selling 
its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus, valued at around E89 million, as it seeks to cut its debt under an EU-IMF bailout, but 
uncertainty over the pension deficit is seen as a hurdle. Shares of Aer Lingus, which have dropped nearly 40pc so 
far this year and nearly 70pc since its 2006 flotation, were down 0.5pc at 67 euro cents. Ryanair's stock was 1.4pc 
lower.

Aer Lingus Rejects Ryanair's Complaints - Quick Facts

Length: 320 words
Body
(RTTNews) - Aer Lingus Group Plc's (AERL.L) Chairman, Colm Barrington, responded to the open letter from 
Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) dated September 13, 2011. Barrington wishes to correct Ryanair Ltd.'s Chief Executive, 
Michael O'Leary's letter of September 13th, which includes several significant misrepresentations about Aer Lingus.
Barrington stated that he totally denies Michael's assertion that Ryanair and other shareholders are "continually 
ignored" by the Aer Lingus board and Management. Aer Lingus agreed for talks regarding the dividend issue at its 
AGM in May, and have a comprehensive programme of meetings with major shareholders following publication of 
its half year results and would be hosting an investor day at the end of this month.
Colm Barrington continued, "Your categorization of the December 2010 transaction in which Aer Lingus bought out 
the interests of the ESOT under the profit share arrangement as being a "gift" to the ESOT is grossly misleading. 
The arrangement put in place at the time of the Aer Lingus IPO involved Aer Lingus agreeing to share a portion of 
its annual profits with the ESOT until the earlier of April 2023 and the full repayment of the ESOT's debt and 
associated interest.'
The board considers the payment of dividends on an ongoing basis, and indeed it provided shareholders with an 
opportunity to express their views on this issue at our AGM last May. Also, the board believes that it is in the best 
interests of all shareholders to consider a dividend when there is a more durable recovery and consequent earnings 
visibility". Further, the company's board is always prepared to listen to shareholders' reasonable representations, 
but at the end of the day must exercise its own judgement as to what is in the best interests of Aer Lingus and all of 
its stakeholders.

Dublin shares have tumbled by 2.5pc this morning, in line with other European markets.
The latest big falls come after the US Federal Reserve warned last night of significant risks to the already struggling 
economy, and after data showed a further contraction in China's manufacturing sector.
The ISEQ index was down 61.13 points a short time ago to 2,381.39.
The market is a sea of red, with CRH down 46c to 1070, DCC off by 38c to 1770, Ryanair slipping 2c to298, Smurfit 
Kappa dropping by 15c to 465, and Aryzta down 33c to 3192. Among the few risers was Origin, up 1c to 340 after a 
strong set of full year results this morning.

Shares in Dublin have followed a general European trend lower this morning, shedding part of their gains of

Investors are also holding back ahead of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting today.
The ISEQ index has slipped by 15.87 points to 2,477.04, after gaining 36.37 points yesterday. Top shares on the

Last week, Ryanair released an online guide that it said revealed ''the 'secrets' to avoiding optional fees''.
The low-cost pioneer strenuously argues that it does not have any hidden charges, but administration and checked 
bag fees have long been a cause of surprise and irritation for many passengers.
Yet the new guide was just the latest in a number of initiatives that, taken together, could be seen as a subtle 
change in approach by an airline that often seems to revel in its 'pile 'em high, treat 'em mean' image.
For example, the airline is renowned for its stringent approach to changing bookings. But policy has been relaxed in 
recent weeks with the introduction of a limited service allowing passengers more flexibility.
Most significant is the extension of priority seating to its Milan and Brussels routes after a successful trial on some 
Dublin and London routes. Passengers can now pay  10 each way to book assigned seats on certain flights - a big 
change for an airline which introduced the boarding scrum to air travel.
To many observers this new initiative is viewed as nothing more than a bid to earn extra ancillary revenues. Yet for 
many years the Ryanair model thrived on the absolute simplicity of its approach. Each new initiative adds a small 
but perceptible layer of complexity. Could it be that with discretionary leisure travellers becoming a rarer species, 
Ryanair is now willing to alter its formula to start hoovering up a greater share of the business travel market?
''Ryanair has made it clear that it is no longer interested in buying Aer Lingus," said one aviation source.
''But maybe it has learned something from the hybrid Aer Lingus type model and is going to, once again, take Aer 
Lingus and others on at their own game. If Ryanair were to make a success of this in Dublin, then being bought by 
Michael O'Leary might quickly become the least of Aer Lingus's worries."
Change is in the air for O'Leary
Brian Devine, NCB chief economist, believes the experience of Easyjet on some key business routes in central 
Europe is instructive when looking at Ryanair's strategy. It's not necessarily that Ryanair is changing its ways to 
attract business people, rather the business market is coming to Ryanair.
''It competes heavily with some of the flag carriers, it is starting to definitely gain market share among business 
travellers," he said. ''More business travellers are now trading down on short haul routes in particular."
According to Devine, because the differences between flag carriers and low-cost carriers in terms of short-haul 
services is narrowing all the time, it is easier for Ryanair to start competing for business travellers.
They could do this, he said, without changing their cost base or operational practices.
''Ryanair's deputy chief executive Michael Cawley mentioned on the last investor call that the airline does get 
significant numbers of business passengers," says Devine. ''They just don't make it a policy decision to go after 
them like Easyjet, but they do have decent numbers and small value added things like being able to choose your 
seat will help."
For now the priority seating initiative is only going to have limited impact on Ryanair's revenues. But a briefing note 
by Goodbody Stockbrokers suggests that it could ultimately generate up to  100 million per year.
''Operating reserved seating on a small number of routes means it is a useful, if immaterial, contributor to the 
revenue line presently," said Goodbody. ''However, the figure could become more material in the future should it be 
rolled out much more extensively. Assuming about one-third of users already pay for priority boarding, then we 
estimate that the service would generate an additional  200 of revenue per flight. Now multiply that up by 481,800 
flights per annum and the figures start to add up."
With high fuel costs and falling passenger numbers, no airline can ignore such potential revenue. Ryanair claims 
that other airlines use words like 'business travel' and 'premium' as a means to overcharge passengers and recoup 
high costs.
''They are desperate to find some way to differentiate themselves due to an inability to compete on price with 
Ryanair, but that is all just window dressing," a company spokesman said.
''Increasingly, business, community and political leaders are waking up to the reality that 'premium' and 'business' 
means they are wasting their shareholders' or taxpayers' money, which is why they are switching to Ryanair."
Whether or not that proves to be the case remains to be seen. But it appears that Ryanair is willing to bend a few of 
its cardinal rules to ensure that it happens.

Ryanair to charge for using any card but its own

Ryanair customers will soon be hit with a new fee when they purchase tickets unless they use the airline's own 
prepaid MasterCard.
The Dublin-based discount airline announced Tuesday that starting Nov. 1 customers who use other forms of 
plastic will pay an administrative fee of 6 pounds (about $9.50) for each one-way flight so double the fee for a 
round-trip ticket.
Consumer groups criticized the move from an airline already well known for an array of fees.
Richard Lloyd, executive director of the UK consumer-advocacy group Which?, said Ryanair was making it difficult 
for customers to avoid a surcharge when paying for flights. He called on the UK government to ban charges on 
debit cards that only appear at the end of the online booking process.
Ryanair Holdings PLC spokesman Stephen McNamara countered that the airline offers low fares and no fuel 
surcharges and gives customers a way to avoid the booking fee.
Currently, Ryanair waives its "admin fee" of 6 pounds for customers who use any MasterCard prepaid debit card.
Ryanair said it will sell the new card on its site for 6 pounds and give buyers a travel voucher in the same amount.
Ryanair charges fees for a variety of services including checking bags, priority boarding, reserving a seat and 
carrying a musical instrument or infant gear such as a car or booster seat. The airline says it charges such fees to 
keep fares as low as possible for passengers who don't require extras.

The main Dublin shares index rose for the third straight day this morning helped by signs that euro zone leaders are 
committed to keeping Greece afloat for now.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 36 points to 2,503.51.
European markets rose by almost 2 percent before trimming gains, with banking shares recovering from an initial 
dip on news of a dollar 2 billion loss for Swiss bank UBS due to unauthorised trading by a London-based employee. 
Worries over the euro zone crisis and a global slide into recession have hammered shares since late July and there 
was little conviction this week's gains were anything other than just a breather. "Given the fact that we are not 
seeing much more than rhetoric at the moment, many people are still expecting Greece to default and see the move 
up as nothing more than a relief rally," Zahid Mahmood, trader at Capital Spreads, said. French and German 
leaders urged Greece's prime minister in a conference call late on Wednesday to meet the terms of its new bailout 
and said they were determined to keep the country in the euro zone.
Shares in Grafton Group rose 12c to E2.85. In the UK, Grafton's biggest market, Kingfisher has announced first half 
results for the period to the end of July. Revenues rose 3.8pc to £5,662m (up 3pc on a constant currency basis); 
retail profit increased 18pc to £473m; and adjusted pre-tax profit rose 24pc to £439m. Adjusted EPS rose 27pc to 
13.5p, while an interim dividend of 2.47p has been declared, up 28pc year-on-year (yoy). Ryanair has written an 
open letter to Aer Lingus, seeking it to pay a dividend of around E20 per share (E110m) for its stake and requesting 
a shareholder vote before any additional cash payments are made to its defined contribution pension deficit. The

Body
Ryanair, the 30pc owner of rival Aer Lingus, has launched a devastating critique of the flag-carrier's performance 
and attempted to rally support from other shareholders for a 110m euro special dividend.
In an open letter to Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington, Ryanair has demanded the board consult with investors 
over three issues it claims will "significantly rebuild shareholder value that has been destroyed".
Alongside the dividend, payable from Aer Lingus' 900m euro cash reserves, Ryanair called for "assurances" that no 
more unscheduled payments would be made to plug its 400m to 500m euro pension deficit and for a copy of the 
independent investigation into a flawed "leave and rehire" scheme that cost Aer Lingus 29.5m euros.
The airline paid the sum - even though it was the staff that faced a tax liability - after the Revenue objected to a 
scheme whereby it made 913 employees redundant and then rehired 715 of them. It is understood that earlier this 
year Ryanair tried to have these issues tabled at Aer Lingus's annual meeting in June but was rebuffed. Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he had decided to go public with his concerns after the Irish government last 
week said it might sell its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus - and Ryanair's own change of strategy that could see it also 
offload its holding. "Now that the government's going to sell its stake, we are no longer going to sit there quietly 
while the value dribbles away," Mr O'Leary said. His letter complains that in its five years as a public company Aer 
Lingus has "racked up cumulative losses of over 150m euros, exceptional charges of almost 400m euros and has 
seen its stock market value fall from over 1.5bn euros to about 350m euros". Aer Lingus has also twice turned down 
takeover bids from Ryanair. The low-fare carrier offered 2.80 euros per share in early 2007 and 1.40 euros in late 
2008 - both well above last night's 67c close. An Aer Lingus spokesman declined to comment.

Ryanair, the 30pc owner of rival Aer Lingus, has launched a devastating critique of the flag-carrier's performance 
and attempted to rally support from other shareholders for a 110m euro special dividend.
In an open letter to Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington, Ryanair has demanded the board consult with investors 
over three issues it claims will "significantly rebuild shareholder value that has been destroyed".
Alongside the dividend, payable from Aer Lingus' 900m euro cash reserves, Ryanair called for "assurances" that no 
more unscheduled payments would be made to plug its 400m to 500m euro pension deficit and for a copy of the 
independent investigation into a flawed "leave and rehire" scheme that cost Aer Lingus 29.5m euros.
The airline paid the sum - even though it was the staff that faced a tax liability - after the Revenue objected to a 
scheme whereby it made 913 employees redundant and then rehired 715 of them. It is understood that earlier this 
year Ryanair tried to have these issues tabled at Aer Lingus's annual meeting in June but was rebuffed. Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he had decided to go public with his concerns after the Irish government last 
week said it might sell its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus - and Ryanair's own change of strategy that could see it also 
offload its holding. "Now that the government's going to sell its stake, we are no longer going to sit there quietly 
while the value dribbles away," Mr O'Leary said. His letter complains that in its five years as a public company Aer 
Lingus has "racked up cumulative losses of over 150m euros, exceptional charges of almost 400m euros and has 
seen its stock market value fall from over 1.5bn euros to about 350m euros". Aer Lingus has also twice turned down 
takeover bids from Ryanair. The low-fare carrier offered 2.80 euros per share in early 2007 and 1.40 euros in late 
2008 - both well above last night's 67c close. An Aer Lingus spokesman declined to comment.

The main Dublin shares index rose sharply in the morning on the back of some encouraging news about the 
worsening euro debt crisis but went in to reverse in the afternoon as investors pocketed gains from a two-day rally.
The ISEQ fell 3.63 points to 2,463.88.
European stocks rose for a third day today, after German and French leaders said they were determined to keep

Demands for special dividend
Body
Ryanair has intensified its confrontation with Aer Lingus by demanding that the Irish flag-carrier pay a special 
dividend to shareholders.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, on Wednesday made a scathing attack on Aer Lingus's board and 
management, and sought assurances that shareholders would have no liability for the large deficit in a pension 
scheme involving the Irish carrier.
Ryanair has a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, but last week Europe's leading low-cost airline ruled out bidding for 
the Dublin government's 25 per cent shareholding in the Irish carrier.
Ryanair's stance could pave the way for a takeover of Aer Lingus by another airline. Ryanair has attempted two 
takeovers of Aer Lingus since 2006, but both failed after objections by the Dublin government and European 
competition authorities.
Aer Lingus declined to respond to Ryanair's comments.
In a letter to Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus' chairman, Mr O'Leary highlighted that the Irish carrier's gross cash 
position had increased by EUR34.4m to EUR919.4m (£799m) at June 30. He also drew attention to Aer Lingus's 
move to push back a delivery of new aircraft from 2013-14 to 2018 at the earliest.
"This rise in Aer Lingus' cash and deferral of aircraft capex until 2018 clearly allows the board of Aer Lingus to 
consider and pay a special dividend of say EUR0.20 per share [a total of about EUR110m] to shareholders during 
2011," said Mr O'Leary.
He went on to complain that Aer Lingus's share price had fallen 80 per cent since 2007, and accused the Irish 
carrier's management of "catastrophic mismanagement", including in relation to taxation matters.
Ryanair steps up Aer Lingus confrontation
Analysts said one impediment to a takeover of Aer Lingus could be the company's obligations towards two pension 
schemes relating to its past and current workers.
At its interim results last month, Aer Lingus said one of the pension schemes was estimated to have an actuarial 
deficit of EUR400m last December 31.
It added that the company's stance that it has no responsibility for the deficit could be challenged in the courts. "If, 
contrary to the firm legal advice that the company has received, a court were to find against the company in any 
such litigation, significant or very significant loss could arise," said Aer Lingus.

RYANAIR attacked the board of Irish airline Aer Lingus yesterday, demanding it ask shareholders their views on 
three issues in a bid to rebuild value at the company.
Ryanair, currently one of the biggest shareholders in Aer Lingus, said investors should decide whether they receive 
an (EURO)0.20 per share special dividend to compensate for the firm's 80 per cent loss of value since 2007.
It said investors should also be asked their views on a halt on payments into the firm's pension fund, which is 
running a large deficit.

Ryanair is to pull its only remaining route from Aberdeen Airport, following a breakdown in talks with airport operator 
BAA.
The airline said it would end its Aberdeen to Dublin route next month, claiming BAA had refused to extend a low-
cost deal.
Its final flight will depart on 28 October.
Aberdeen Airport described the move as "incredibly disappointing" but added the route was served by other 
carriers. Ryanair's head of communications, Stephen McNamara, said: "Ryanair regrets the forced closure of its 
one remaining Aberdeen (Dublin) route, after BAA refused an extension to our low cost deal from 29 October and 
failed to match the competitive cost deals which are available to Ryanair from other UK and European airports." He 
added that any passengers who were booked to travel after 28 October would receive a full refund. Aberdeen's 
managing director Derek Provan said: "It is incredibly disappointing to hear of Ryanair's intentions to remove their 
service from Aberdeen Airport. "Over the years the frequency of the flights have reduced dramatically. However, it 
is sad to see them pulling the remaining rotations altogether." Mr Provan said the airport had spent months 
negotiating with Ryanair over unspecified "future leisure opportunities" which the airline had felt unable to consider. 
He added: "This is disappointing in the light of considerable investment in our infrastructure as we continue to try 
and grow our leisure routes. "We have kept the door open to the airline to allow any future discussion if they so 
wish, however we appreciate that at the end of the day it is our passengers who will feel the brunt of this decision. 
"The route is served by other carriers and as such we hope they will not be too dramatically inconvenienced in the 
long term."

A RECORD number of passengers flew from Heathrow airport last month despite the impact of Hurricane Irene, 
which disrupted flights to the east coast of the US.
Heathrow's owner BAA said 6.6m travellers passed through London's biggest airport last month, up 0.7 per cent on 
the previous year.
Much of the growth in passenger flights came from journeys across the North Atlantic, with trips to Montreal up 50 
per cent and Detroit up 42 per cent in August. BAA said that about 40,000 additional passengers would have 
travelled through Heathrow had it not been for the hurricane.
Growth at Heathrow helped offset a 5.1 per cent drop in traffic at Stansted airport compared with the August last 
year, which BAA blames on its airlines, including the budget carrier Ryanair, cutting back on capacity.
Meanwhile, the number of travellers at BAA's Scottish airports rose strongly in August ,with a three per cent 
increase at Edinburgh and a 5.5 per cent rise at Glasgow.
BAA, owned by Spain's Ferrovial, has been ordered by the Competition Commission to sell Stansted and either its 
Edinburgh or Glasgow airport in Scotland to improve competition in the sector.
But BAA's chief executive Colin Matthews said the group, which was forced to sell Gatwick in 2009, is considering a 
judicial review that could further delay the watchdog's ruling, which first started in 2007.
Overall, BAA's six UK airports handled 10.7m passengers in August, up by around 0.2 per cent on the previous 
year.

No frills carrier, Ryanair, this morning said that it will close its Dublin-Aberdeen route from the end of next month.
It blames the airport operator, BAA, for refusing to extend its agreement on airport charges.
"Ryanair regrets the forced closure of its one remaining Aberdeen (Dublin) route, after the BAA refused an 
extension to our low cost deal from 29th October and failed to match the competitive cost deals which are available 
to Ryanair from other UK and European airports," the airline's Stephen McNamara said.
"Ryanair's last Aberdeen - Dublin flight will depart on 28th October, and any passengers who are booked to travel 
after this date will receive a full refund."

Briefing
toulouse hits order milestone
airframer Airbus has broken through the net 1,000-order mark for the year, following the firming of several 
agreements in August. These include an 88-jet deal for A320s from two Chinese firms, disclosed earlier this year, 
and the confirmation of 135 A320neo-family orders from Lufthansa, Cebu Pacific, Garuda Indonesia and lessor CIT. 
Thai Airways International provided the only widebody order for August, signing for four A350-900s. Gross orders 
for the airframer this year reached 1,156, but Airbus has also achieved a four-digit net figure, with a total of 1,015 
aircraft. It delivered 334 aircraft over the first eight months of 2011 - one fewer than at the same point in 2010.
Monarch, bangkok airways axe orders
cancellations UK holiday carrier Monarch Airlines has emerged as the latest customer to cancel its Boeing 787 
order, axing six aircraft from the twinjet's backlog. The company said it had "reassessed its decision" to purchase 
the aircraft, to concentrate on reinforcing its scheduled short-haul operations. Meanwhile, Asian carrier Bangkok 
Airways has cancelled its order for Airbus A350s, undoing a deal for four -800 aircraft. The decision takes the -800's 
backlog, to the end of August 2011, down to 131 aircraft.
global hawks lined up by south korea
unmanned South Korea's plan to acquire four Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Block 30 Global Hawks, first revealed in 
March, has moved a step closer. The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency is likely to notify Congress in the 
coming weeks of the possible sale of the aircraft and one ground system. US government officials familiar with the 
matter said the deal was worth around $850 million. If it proceeds, two aircraft will be delivered in 2015 and two in 
2016.
no aer lingus sell-off until 2012
No Headline In Original
finance Ireland's government does not expect to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus until at least next year. No formal 
decision has been made about the disposal of the shareholding, said a spokesman for Ireland's department for 
transport, tourism and sport. A sale would not be possible immediately and could only happen in the medium-term, 
"perhaps next year", he said. Ryanair has already been ruled out as a prospective buyer on competition grounds.
early return for leased Airbus A330s
airlines Tour operator Thomas Cook is to cut six aircraft from its UK fleet as it looks to trim capacity. The company 
is to remove four Airbus A330-200s, a Boeing 767-300ER and an Airbus A320-200 from the fleet of Thomas Cook 
Airlines by the end of the year, cutting its overall size from 41 to 35. Three A330s will be returned to their lessors, 
CIT Group and Lease Corp International. A further A330 will return to Thomas Cook's Scandinavian business at the 
end of 2011, while the Boeing 767 will join German sister airline Condor. The A320, owned by Thomas Cook, will 
be retired. Up to 250 staff will be affected by the shake-up.
israel approves missile defence funding
safety Installation of countermeasures on Israel-registered civil aircraft - for protection against shoulder-launched 
missiles - will be accelerated following an Israeli cabinet decision to allocate funds to the project. Israel's 
government has been grappling with the problem since a failed attempt in 2002 to shoot down an Arkia Boeing 757 
on take off from Kenya's Mombasa airport.

News In Brief
## Quinn Insurance has suffered a sharp fall in business in the past year ahead of its takeover by Liberty Mutual 
and Anglo Irish Bank. The value of motor premiums written has halved, mainly because of a 67pc drop in business 
from Britain. The Irish business recorded a drop of al most 15pc in motor premiums. The firm has recorded even 
bigger drops in other segments of its business. Commercial premiums have fallen by 87pc in value after the 
company quit the commercial insurance sector in Britain - Sunday Business Post
## One51, the troubled investment conglomerate, will tell shareholders this week that it plans to sell all non-core 
assets over a "realistic" period and use the proceeds to pay down debt. Interim chief executive Alan Walsh has told 
larger shareholders that the company will manage its investment portfolio, which includes stakes in ferries group 
ICG, and recycling group NTR, to "successful realisation" and that there would be no fire sales. Its bakery company 
Irish Pride is almost certain to be earmarked for sale, as well as some recycling businesses in Britain. - Sunday 
Times
## Twenty one senior civil servants have received lump sums of between 440,000 and 570,000 euros when they 
retired in the past four years. A further 94 retired officials received lump sums of 225,000 euros. The retired officials 
also receive annual pensions of between 75 - 142,000 euros at a total cost to the taxpayer of almost 10m euros 
every year. The details of the retirement packages were released by the Dept of Finance last week. - Sunday 
Business Post ## Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has claimed that Shannon Airport "has priced itself out 
of existence" in a letter to Clare County Council. The claim met with an angry response from the Shannon Airport 
Authority, which described the letter as "self-serving and having no basis in fact". In the letter, Mr O'Leary states 
that traffic at Shannon "has continued to implode" as a result of cost increases imposed by the Dublin Airport 
Authority and "will fall below 1.5 million in 2011". In a table contained in the letter, Mr O'Leary estimates that traffic

out of Shannon this year will be 1.4 million - almost half its 2007 peak of 3.6 million. In the letter, Mr O'Leary states: 
"Ryanair has consistently stated that it can and will deliver rapid traffic growth at the main Irish airports". - Irish 
Independent ## Groupon grew its share to n52pc of the 4.4m euros spent on daily deals in Ireland during August, 
despite putting a stock market flotation on hold because of fears it is putting growth ahead of profits. According to 
Sift.ie, an aggregator that summarises the offers, the fledgling daily deals market in Ireland jumped to 4.4m euros in 
August from 2.4m euros the previous month. Apart from Groupon, the mian players are Pigsback and GrabOne, 
which is backed by Independent News and Media. - Sunday Times ## Roscommon mman Peter Kelly has sold his 
US-based online car auction firm Openlane for 150m euros in one of the biggest windfalls for an Irish entrepreneur 
this year. Rival auction form KAR - which is valued at USD 1.8bn - agreed the all cahs deal to buy the California-

Body
The Dublin shares market's three-day winning streak went in to a complete reversal today further at the close of the 
week amid growing unease about the prospects for the world economy and where the European debt crisis will 
lead.
The index fell 79.99 points to 2,444.02.
European shares ended sharply lower today on concerns U.S. President Barack Obama's dollar 447 billion jobs 
package might face hurdles in Congress and as the resignation of a top ECB official signalled a rift within the 
central bank. The move by ECB Executive Board Member Juergen Stark to quit in disagreement with the bank's 
policy of buying euro zone government bonds to combat the currency bloc's debt crisis further hurt sentiment at a 
time when the role of the central bank was crucial to resolve the euro zone debt crisis. The FTSEurofirst 300 of top 
European shares provisionally closed 2.5 percent lower at 916.10 points.
The eagerly anticipated announcement of a US economic stimulus plan was broadly as expected. President Obama 
announced measures totalling dollar 447bn, around dollar 250bn of which is in the form of tax cuts for both 
employees and employers and the balance in spending increases in areas such as additional aid to state and local 
government (dollar 85bn), the extension of emergency unemployment benefit programmes (dollar 60bn), education 
(dollar 65bn) and highway infrastructure, dollar 50bn. CRH derives just over half of its total revenues from the US 
and its shares dropped 60c to E11.29. Low-cost carriers (LCCs) are best positioned in a downturn in terms of 
margins and cash generation, according to an analysis by Davy analyst, Stephen Furlong. The LCCs have relatively 
low operational/financial gearing and should gain from a potential fall in oil prices and reductions in competitor 
capacity. Networks are more reliant than LCCs on global GDP growth and have greater operational/financial 
leverage, he said. Shares in Ryanair fell 7c to E3.09 while Aer Lingus fell 3c to E0.66 after the Government said it

might sell its stake. HMV Group released a statement for the 18 weeks to September 3. Over the period, like for like 
sales (lfl) declined by 15.1pc continuing the weak trend experienced throughout the previous twelve months. This 
should come as no surprise given the recent results from Argos and Dixons, according to Goodbodys analyst, 
David O'Brien. (It is of note that HMV's technology offering (in which it will afford more store space to products such 
as MP3 players, speakers, headsets, etc) is doing well, with sales growing by over 100pc year on year (yoy). This

The Dublin shares market's three-day winning streak went in to a complete reversal today further at the close of the 
week amid growing unease about the prospects for the world economy and where the European debt crisis will 
lead.
The index fell 79.99 points to 2,444.02.
European shares ended sharply lower today on concerns U.S. President Barack Obama's dollar 447 billion jobs 
package might face hurdles in Congress and as the resignation of a top ECB official signalled a rift within the 
central bank. The move by ECB Executive Board Member Juergen Stark to quit in disagreement with the bank's 
policy of buying euro zone government bonds to combat the currency bloc's debt crisis further hurt sentiment at a 
time when the role of the central bank was crucial to resolve the euro zone debt crisis. The FTSEurofirst 300 of top 
European shares provisionally closed 2.5 percent lower at 916.10 points.
The eagerly anticipated announcement of a US economic stimulus plan was broadly as expected. President Obama 
announced measures totalling dollar 447bn, around dollar 250bn of which is in the form of tax cuts for both 
employees and employers and the balance in spending increases in areas such as additional aid to state and local 
government (dollar 85bn), the extension of emergency unemployment benefit programmes (dollar 60bn), education 
(dollar 65bn) and highway infrastructure, dollar 50bn. CRH derives just over half of its total revenues from the US 
and its shares dropped 60c to E11.29. Low-cost carriers (LCCs) are best positioned in a downturn in terms of 
margins and cash generation, according to an analysis by Davy analyst, Stephen Furlong. The LCCs have relatively 
low operational/financial gearing and should gain from a potential fall in oil prices and reductions in competitor 
capacity. Networks are more reliant than LCCs on global GDP growth and have greater operational/financial 
leverage, he said. Shares in Ryanair fell 7c to E3.09 while Aer Lingus fell 3c to E0.66 after the Government said it

OFT launches an inquiry into airline fees for card purchases
OFT launches an inquiry into airline fees for card purchases

Airlines including EasyJet, Lufthansa's BMI and Flybe are being investigated by the Office of Fair Trading over 
surcharges for using debit and credit cards.
The OFT said on Thursday it had opened a formal investigation into "a number of airlines".
The probe followed a warning by the regulator in June that retailers which levied artificially high fees for card 
payments, or did not advertise fees charged, faced action under consumer protection laws.
The OFT was pressed to look into the issue after Which?, the consumer group, in March drew up a list of retailers 
including estate agents, insurers and airlines, that used "excessive" fees on debit cards, often springing them on 
customers at the last minute. Budget airlines including Ryanair were picked out as particular offenders.
Airline ticket buyers in the UK are estimated to have spent £300m on surcharges last year.
The OFT said in June that it would lobby the government to change the law to ban surcharging on debit cards.
The OFT is examining whether the companies complied with consumer-protection legislation. The watchdog can 
demand undertakings from companies to stop certain practices that it deems unfair. If they do not, the OFT must 
take the companies to court and it would be for the court to levy an eventual unlimited fine.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, declined to comment on whether it had been contacted by the OFT. It 
charges £6 per person per flight when credit or debit cards are used to buy tickets, although the airline describes 
the arrangement as an "administration fee". It said: "Since Ryanair don't levy either credit card or debit card fees, 
we do not believe that this investigation or its outcome will have any effect on us."
EasyJet, Europe's second largest low-cost airline, charges £8 per booking when credit or debit cards are used, 
which means the fee can cover a group of people rather than just one individual. EasyJet declined to comment.
OFT launches an inquiry into airline fees for card purchases
Flybe, the UK regional airline, confirmed that it was contacted by the OFT. "We can also confirm that we have had 
constructive and positive early discussions with the OFT and look forward to working with them to resolving these 
important issues."
Lufthansa, the German airline that operates flights out of Heathrow, also confirmed that it had been contacted by 
the OFT. "We received a letter from the OFT and we will of course look into this letter and provide the necessary 
information," it said.
Lufthansa added that BMI, its subsidiary that also operates flights from Heathrow, had received a separate letter 
from the OFT asking for information.
The OFT has long scrutinised business practices among airlines. It fined British Airways   £121.5m in 2007 for fixing 
the price of fuel surcharges with Virgin Atlantic   . A related criminal trial - the first contested prosecution of price-
fixing the OFT brought - of four current and former BA executives collapsed last year after the emergence of 
thousands of new documents from Virgin Atlantic's databases during the trial. BA has since signalled its 
unhappiness over the size of the fine, which is yet to be paid.

The ISEQ rally held this morning after the ECB left base interest rates unchanged as inflation fears faded in to the 
background but recession worries mounted.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 23.60 points to 2,543.02.
The European Central Bank held interest rates at 1.5 percent today and is likely to indicate that a policy tightening 
cycle it began in April is on hold in the face of growing evidence the euro zone's economic recovery is losing 
momentum. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will explain the Governing Council's decision news conference 
later. Markets are looking for hints of a long break before the next interest rate increase, and for any signs the ECB 
could even cut rates. The bank's reactivation of its bond-buy programme will also be in the spotlight now the euro 
zone debt crisis has spread to Italy.
Equity markets enjoyed a welcome rally in anticipation of President Obama's expected announcement of a "jobs-
focused" stimulus plan. There may also be some indication from the Federal Reserve that it is planning some form 
of monetary stimulus to deal with the sluggish recovery in the economy and high unemployment rate. Transport 
minister Leo Varadkar has indicated that the government may sell its 25pc holding in Aer Lingus. The other large 
minority holder, Ryanair, said yesterday that it would welcome another financially strong airline/investor acquiring

The ISEQ rally held this morning after the ECB left base interest rates unchanged as inflation fears faded in to the 
background but recession worries mounted.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 23.60 points to 2,543.02.
The European Central Bank held interest rates at 1.5 percent today and is likely to indicate that a policy tightening 
cycle it began in April is on hold in the face of growing evidence the euro zone's economic recovery is losing 
momentum. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will explain the Governing Council's decision news conference 
later. Markets are looking for hints of a long break before the next interest rate increase, and for any signs the ECB 
could even cut rates. The bank's reactivation of its bond-buy programme will also be in the spotlight now the euro 
zone debt crisis has spread to Italy.
Equity markets enjoyed a welcome rally in anticipation of President Obama's expected announcement of a "jobs-
focused" stimulus plan. There may also be some indication from the Federal Reserve that it is planning some form 
of monetary stimulus to deal with the sluggish recovery in the economy and high unemployment rate. Transport 
minister Leo Varadkar has indicated that the government may sell its 25pc holding in Aer Lingus. The other large

Irish flag-carrier may face takeover
IAG City favourite to bid for airline
Body
Ryanair on Wednesday ruled out bidding for the Dublin government's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, in a move 
that could pave the way for a takeover of the Irish flag-carrier.
Analysts said International Airlines Group, the company that owns British Airways and Iberia, was the leading 
candidate to buy Aer Lingus.
On Wednesday, Leo Varadkar, Ireland's transport minister, said Dublin no longer regarded its 25 per cent stake in 
Aer Lingus as a strategic asset and was considering selling it as part of efforts to reduce the country's budget 
deficit.
He added that he would object to Ryanair buying the stake, which is worth about EUR89m (£78.3m) based on the 
Irish flag-carrier's share price.
Ryanair has a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, but two attempted take-overs since 2006 of the Irish flag-carrier by 
Europe's leading low-cost airline have failed following objections by the Dublin government and European 
competition authorities.
"If the Irish government wishes to dispose of its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, and if the government believes that 
any offer from Ryanair for this stake would be unwelcome, then Ryanair is happy to confirm that it will not bid for the 
government's 25 per cent stake," said Ryanair.
The budget carrier added that should another airline purchase the Irish government's stake in Aer Lingus, it would 
"not rule out entering into discussions with that party for the subsequent disposal of Ryanair's near-30 per cent 
stake, subject to an acceptable agreement on price".
Ryanair eschews Aer Lingus state stake
Aer Lingus' shares closed up 6.3 per cent at 67.5 cents. Mr Varadkar said he was not interested in selling the 
government's stake for less than EUR1 a share.
Analysts said IAG was the most plausible buyer for Aer Lingus partly because of the Irish carrier's valuable take-off 
and landing slots at Heathrow.
BA has stressed it would like more slots at Heathrow and Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, knows Aer Lingus 
well because he used to be its top manager.
Geoff van Klaveren, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said it also made sense for IAG to be considering Aer Lingus 
because the Irish carrier's long-haul flights were, like BA, focused on the North Atlantic.
Joe Gill, an analyst at Bloxham, said that any sale of the Dublin government's stake in Aer Lingus could be slowed 
down by a looming dispute over how to deal with the deficit in a pension scheme that some of the Irish carrier's 
current and former employees belong to.
He estimated that Aer Lingus' portion of the pension scheme deficit could be as high as EUR250m.
IAG declined to comment.

IRELAND is considering the sale of its 25 per cent stake in airline Aer Lingus as it no longer considers it a strategic 
asset, the transport minister said yesterday.
The government's stake would be worth (EURO)84m (£74m) at yesterday's share price.
"It's certainly under consideration, it's definitely one of the candidates," Leo Varadkar said yesterday.
The government has indicated its priority is to maintain competition in the aviation sector, making a sale to rival 
Ryanair, which already holds close to a 30 per cent stake, unlikely.
Ryanair said in a statement it would not bid for the stake if the government indicated that such an offer would be 
unwelcome. It said it would work with any new investor and would consider selling its own 30 per cent stake.
Concerns that Aer Lingus may have to contribute to cover a (EURO)400m deficit in a pension fund for staff has 
weighed on its share price in recent months and could hamper a sale.
"I can't see an institutional investor coming forward until there is clarity over the pension deficit," said Stephen 
Furlong an analyst with Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin.

The ISEQ rebounded this morning after Germany's top court rejected lawsuits aimed at blocking Berlin's 
participation in bailout packages for Greece and other euro zone countries, including Ireland.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 58.56 points to 2,506.49.
The Constitutional Court also handed the country's parliament a greater say over euro zone bailouts, potentially 
hampering the government's ability to act decisively against a two-year-old debt crisis. But it at least cleared the 
way for Germany to contribute more to the euro zone's rescue fund, giving temporary relief to investors after this 
week's sharp sell-off in risky assets. Better-than-expected data on the U.S. services sector and Australian growth 
as well as speculation that Washington may unveil a dollar 300 billion package to create new jobs also helped 
improve the mood. "Today's ruling should bring some relief to financial markets as a total chaos scenario has been 
avoided but it should not lead to euphoria," said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. "The ruling confirms our view that 
the German piecemeal approach on the debt crisis is not likely to change but eventually the German parliament will 
vote in favour of a second Greek bailout package and the beefed-up EFSF."
Aer Lingus has this morning reported August passenger statistics. The figures show a 4.1pc increase in passenger 
levels, including the regional business with Aer Arann, but on the direct Aer Lingus network, passengers were up 
1.8pc in the month. Available seat kilometres (ASKs) were up 0.6pc in August, so with revenue passenger 
kilometres (RPKs) up by 1.0pc, the load factor improved 40bps to 86.1pc. Short haul (SH) loads were up 80bps to 
84.6pc, with capacity up 2.7pc, but RPKs were up 3.7pc. SH passengers were up 2.4pc. On the long haul (LH) side, 
loads were down 20bps to 89.7pc, with capacity down 4pc mainly due to Hurricane Irene at the end of the month. 
LH passengers were down 4pc. Elsewhere, passengers on the AL Regional business (JV with Aer Arann) were up 
46pc yoy. Shares in the airline climbed 2c to E0.65 while Ryanair gained 11c to E3.07. Dixons has released a

weeks to April and +6pc in the comparable period last year. Management notes that while underlying markets 
remain difficult, it believes the company is outperforming its markets. Unsurprisingly, the outlook remains cautious. 
"Given DCC's focus on broadening out its multi-channel offering, high street retailers such as Dixons, have become 
far less significant to the performance of the SerCom division (c. 20pc of Group profit)," said goodbody

The Government is considering the sale of its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus as it no longer considers it as a 
strategic asset, the transport minister said today.
The government has committed to raising around 2 billion euros from sales of state assets to reduce high public 
debt, but it had indicated that it saw its stake in Aer Lingus as a lever to maintain competition in the sector.
Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said there would be changes of ownership in the state aviation sector during the 
privatisation drive, but he said no final decision had been made on whether to sell its Aer Lingus stake.
"No formal decision on that is made yet," he told Newstalk radio. "What I can say is that that stake in the past was 
held for strategic reasons and having studied the matter over the summer I don't think that really stands any more." 
He said Aer Lingus' prized slots at London's Heathrow Airport were less important than in the past and that Ireland 
would in any case need over 30 percent of the company to block any changes to slots. A government-sponsored 
report published in April recommended that the state sell its 25 percent stake in the airline as soon as is opportune. 
It also named the Dublin Airport Authoritiy (DAA) and the Irish Aviation Authority as possible privatisation targets. 
The sale of one of the terminals at Dublin airport might not yield much money for the government due to the DAA's 
pension deficit, Varadkar said. In April Minister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin said state assets sales were 
unlikely this year and warned that the government supported the European Commission's opposition to a takeover 
of Aer Lingus by Ryanair, which holds a near-30 percent stake in the airline. In a statement, Ryanair said it would 
welcome another financially strong airline/investor acquiring the Govt's 25pc stake, "which could then work with 
Ryanair and other like minded shareholders to restore shareholder value, which has been destroyed over the past 
five years by the Board and Management of Aer Lingus".

end (and +3pc for the same period last year). Like for like sales (Lfl's) in the UK declined by 10pc versus -7pc for 
the 28 weeks to April and +6pc in the comparable period last year. Management notes that while underlying 
markets remain difficult, it believes the company is outperforming its markets. Unsurprisingly, the outlook remains 
cautious. "Given DCC's focus on broadening out its multi-channel offering, high street retailers such as Dixons, 
have become far less significant to the performance of the SerCom division (about 20pc of Group profit)," said 
Goodbody Stockbrokers. DCC's shares rose 19c to E18.96. Glanbia's shares jumped 27c to E4.66. The downtrend 
in dairy product prices at the fortnightly global dairy trade auction, in situ since June, continued at the latest event. 
The all product index was lower on the previous event. But across products and contract periods, the price changes 
were mixed. Price rises were recorded by milk protein concentrate and skim milk powder. Price declines were 
recorded by butter, whole milk powder and cheddar.

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) confirmed Wednesday in a statement that 
it will not bid for the Irish government's 25 percent stake in peer airline Aer Lingus Group PLC. Ryanair revealed 
this in a statement released by it in response to statements reportedly made by Minister for Transport, Leo 
Varadkar.
Varadkar reportedly said that the Government might consider a disposal of its non strategic 25 percent 
shareholding in Aer Lingus. Meanwhile, Ryanair is a near 30 percent stakeholder of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair confirmed in its statement that it will not bid for the government's stake if it wishes to dispose it. Ryanair 
added that it is ready to work with any other financially strong airline/investor that is willing to acquire the 
government's 25 percent stake.
Ryanair revealed in the statement that the airline/investor could then work with it and other like minded 
shareholders to restore shareholder value, which has been destroyed over the past five years by the board and 
management of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair said the shareholder value of Aer Lingus has collapsed by more than 80 percent to less than 0.60 euros 
per share in recent days from the over 3.00 euros per share in early 2007 under the current Board.
However, Ryanair added that it could enter into discussions with the airline/investor in order to dispose off its near 
30 percent stake at an acceptable agreement on price and maximizing shareholder value.
In Wednesday's regular trading session, RYAAY is currently trading at $25.31, up $1.10 or 4.54 percent on a 
volume of 32,066 shares.
Meanwhile, RYA.L is currently trading at 3.09 pence, up 0.14 pence or 4.63 percent on a volume of 3.07 million 
shares on the LSE.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) Wednesday issued its response to reports that the Irish 
Government was planning to divest its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus, and said that it would not make a bid if so 
desired by the government. The reports cite Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar as saying ministers were mulling 
the stake sale.
Further, the airline also welcomed other "financially strong" airlines or investors and said it would even be open to 
selling its own near-30 percent stake in Aer Lingus if that seemed beneficial to shareholders. The company blamed 
the Board and Management of Aer Lingus for destroying its shareholder value.

The main Dublin shares index put in a volatile day's trading today as investors reacted to growing concern about 
Europe's debt crisis but were cheered by positive data from the US.
The ISEQ rose 13.85 points to 2,447.93.
Global stock markets fell on fears of the European debt crisis worsening, while the Swiss franc plunged 8 percent 
against the euro after Switzerland's central bank sought to slow the safe-haven rush into its currency, which it 
worries could hurt its economy. Nervous investors channelled cash into less risky assets as doubts resurfaced over 
Italy and Greece's willingness to implement tough budget and debt measures demanded by other euro zone 
members, while Germany hardened its stand against giving them more aid. However, latest figures show that the 
pace of expansion in the U.S. services sector unexpectedly accelerated in August, snapping a three-month streak 
of slower growth, according to an industry report.
Total Produce has reported first half (H1) numbers. Revenues were flat year-on-year (yoy). Adjusted EBITA (core 
profits) fell 3.5pc to E26.2m. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 2pc to 4.2c. "In what the company has 
described as an unusual trading period, the H1 out-turn is solid. Cash flow generation remains robust, and for us 
the current valuation is an attractive entry point," said Davy's Aiden O'Donnell. Shares rose 1c to E0.38. Media 
reports suggest that CRH may buy a Russian cement business from Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. CRH has 
made no secret of its desire to enter the Russian cement market. It already has significant positions in the 
neighbouring Polish and Ukrainian markets and supplies the St Petersburg market from its Finnish cement plant. 
The Russian cement market remains fairly fragmented but is likely to enjoy significant growth in the future, 
according to Davy Research. CRH has the balance sheet to complete such a deal. This could cost the company 
over E400m based on a 75pc stake in the business that is estimated to be worth E550m, according to a Moscow-
based newspaper. "This would be an interesting deal for CRH and would establish a presence in the Russian 
ISEQ closes up in volatile day's trading ISEQ up
market. It already has the experience of running a successful operation in Poland and Ukraine, and this would help 
to further expand its Eastern European growth platform," the broker said. Shares in CRH climbed 19c to E11.31. 
Ryanair published August passenger statistics this week showing 6pc growth on flat load factors at 89pc. After 
growing by 6pc in July, the airline now looks like it is on track to surpass the 4pc growth rate previously guided for 
the quarter. In previous years, the September month has typically been flat to slightly lower than the August figure. 
At this stage, no growth in September would be required to deliver 4pc passenger growth, which looks too cautious, 
according to Goodbody Stockbrokers, "so it's likely the figure is closer to 5-6pc, delivering at least an extra 250k 
passengers to the airline". Ryanair shares were up 1c at E2.96. UK packaging group DS Smith has released an an 
interim management statement covering the three month period from April 30th. Like-for-like revenues grew 13pc in 
the packaging business, with corrugated volume growth of 3pc, in-line with company guidance and targets, while 
margins have also improved during the quarter. Management attributes this performance to the group's high 
exposure to the resilient consumer goods sector and its ability to fully recover the impact of persistent cost 
increases. Shares in Smurfit Kappa fell 13c to E4.83.

available for passengers, edged down 0.1 percent points to 92.2 percent from 92.3 percent last year.
However, total passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, for the month were 5.54 million, 6.5 
percent higher than prior year's 5.20 million.
The company noted that earned seats include seats that are flown whether the passenger turns up or not, as 
easyJet is a no-refund airline.
Among peers, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) on Monday reported that passengers in August grew 6 
percent to 8.14 million, while load factor remained flat at 89 percent.
In the preceding month of July, easyJet reported a 0.8 percentage point rise in load factor to 91.7 percent and total 
passengers grew 8.1 percent to 5.43 million.
On the basis of a rolling 12 months ending August, easyJet's load factor increased 0.3 percentage points to 87.2 
percent, and passengers climbed 11.8 percent to 54.10 million.
In a different development on Monday, easyJet's board confirmed that it has received a request from easyGroup 
asking it to convene an extraordinary general meeting to put forward a a resolution to vote on the removal of 
Professor Rigas Doganis as a director of the company.
easyGroup Holdings, owned by easyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, is the largest single shareholder in easyJet. 
Haji-Ioannou, along with his family, holds around 38 percent of easyJet.
Noting that the request is a further unnecessary and costly distraction, the company said its board will write to 
shareholders in due course recommending that they vote against this resolution.
EasyJet August Load Factor Edges Down, While Number Of Passengers Up - Update
The company said in its statement, "The Board believes that this resolution is not about removing Rigas Doganis as 
a director of easyJet but a clear attempt by a minority shareholder to inappropriately determine the composition of 
the Board and to override normal corporate governance protocols."
EasyJet's Board also rejected a number of inaccurate claims made repeatedly by easyGroup in recent weeks, 
regarding its fleet announcement and outlook.
Haji-Ioannou has earlier sought the departure of the company's deputy chairman David Michels earlier than 
planned, and has been calling the company to pay dividends rather than expand fleet.
easyJet has confirmed Monday that it plans to cap the size of its fleet for at least the next two winters, and added 
that it will see whether or not there should be a return over and above the 20 percent dividend the airline proposes 
to pay to shareholders.
EZJ.L is currently trading at 323.10 pence, down 1.50 pence or 0.46 percent.

Exodus from ISE continues
The formal takeover offer for IFG, announced last week, will in all likelihood see the financial services group 
become the next company to exit the Irish stock market. It seems the steady flow of exists of companies from the 
Irish Stock Exchange will continue for some time to come. Natural attrition, which normally sees companies leave, 
get taken over or merge, replaced by a similar number who decide to float.
During boom times the numbers floating on the stock exchange will often outstrip those exiting. But during this 
downturn the number of companies going off the exchange, for various reasons, has been incredible. In recent 
weeks Balmoral, the former Blackrock International property company, secured shareholder backing to de-list. No 
explanations are necessary as to why a quoted commercial property company might want to de-list from the Irish 
exchange right now. It follows house builder McInerney - which also disappeared from the exchange - simply 
because it went bust.
The nationalisation of Anglo in 2009 was quickly followed by the collapse of Waterford Wedgwood later that year. 
Bathroom suite maker Qualceram went into examinership.
Last year Niall McFadden's Boundary Capital went. Oglesby & Butler was taken out by takeover, as was Norkom 
Technologies. AIB is as good as gone, having become 99 per cent state-owned.
Irish Life & Permanent will follow as buyers are found for the insurance business and the state becomes the biggest 
shareholder in Permanent TSB. Food group Aryzta is now listed in Switzerland, while Greencore has taken away its 
Dublin listing.
The question of who might be next is quite telling. It seems highly unlikely that Aer Lingus, having already been the 
subject of two Ryanair approaches, will remain on the exchange for the long term.
The INQUISITOR
Readymix has also received takeover approaches in the past. Irish Continental was the subject of a long protracted 
takeover battle, which could resurface, albeit without some of its previous suitors.
Companies that might have been seen as candidates for a listing included On 51, now in consolidation mode and 
NTR, which has broken up and is reinventing itself. Wind energy group Airtricity would have been another 
candidate, but it was taken over. While the software sector in Ireland continues to do well, there are few signs of a 
flotation coming to the Irish market from that sector any time soon.
The causes behind the various high profile exits are obvious.
But is there a much deeper malaise in the Irish market that will impact on the sparse number of new listings in the 
future. If it were just a cyclical thing, then in theory, more candidates for flotation should emerge in the coming 
years. But given the carnage in stock buying in Dublin, the weakening of the indigenous stockbroking sector and the 
clear lack of private investor money, this may be a much longer term pattern.
The Irish exchange runs the risk of being truly peripheral in a single currency, something many believed would 
happen when the euro came along. But the sheer explosion of private wealth and the appetite for investment 
masked that peripheral reality for many years.
There are some positives out there. For example, in Kerry Group, Ryanair and CRH, we still have three blue chip 
Irish companies that are as good at what they do, as anyone else in their industry worldwide.
Other companies like DCC continue to do well, as does the smaller investment vehicle Trinity Venture Capital. Bank 
of Ireland will remain on the exchange and even hardy stocks trying to stage a recovery, like Kingspan and Grafton 
Group, are still a real presence.
But for Irish stockbrokers though, thin pickings are about to get even thinner.

John Saunders is director of Shine, a national support organisation for people with mental ill health, their families 
and friends.
Shine runs support groups and resource centres and offers counselling services. Its website, www.resource.ie, 
offers advice and information to people who suffer from mental ill health, their relatives, the general public and 
healthcare professionals.
Established in 1979, Shine has 40 staff at offices in Dublin, Cork, Tullamore, Galway, Kilkenny and Dundalk. It 
coordinates See Change, an alliance of organisations working together to bring about positive change in public 
attitudes and behaviour towards people with mental health problems.
What are your job responsibilities?
To fulfil all the chief executive functions of Shine and, specifically, to work on building awareness of the organisation 
and the main issues affecting people directly affected by mental ill health.
What motivates you professionally?
An energy and commitment to getting the job done. Succeeding in the objectives that have been set out and 
helping to make significant change for the better in people's lives.
How would you describe your work style?
A mix of strong decision-making and building effective teams that achieve success.
What rates as your best professional decision to date?
To develop the See Change programme as a national initiative to reduce stigma in mental health.
working WEEK
What is the most valuable lesson you have learned?
To approach the task in hand with sincerity. If you do that, you usually find sincerity in other people.
Who do you most admire in Irish business?
Michael O'Leary of Ryanair is someone I would admire for doing what he has done. He has not only created an 
international company out of a fledgling Irish venture, but has also radically changed the whole structure of the 
international airline industry.
What are your expectations for Irish businesses?
I think we are probably now at the lowest point of the economic cycle and so hopefully things can only get better.
What is your ultimate professional goal?
To make sure that Shine thrives as a major national voluntary organisation, and to see that the See Change 
programme is successful in reducing stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental ill health.

THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has resumed its investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus and 
said it expected to reach a decision by the end of next month.
The move, which Ryanair slammed as "unnecessary" and "damaging", is part of an OFT probe into whether 
Ryanair's 30 per cent holding in the carrier gives it undue influence and hampers competition.
Ryanair maintains that the OFT has run out of time to examine the failed merger, which fell through five years ago, 
and in any case has no jurisdiction over a deal between two Irish companies.
But last month the Competition Appeal Tribunal said the OFT could still pass the case onto the Competition 
commission for further investigation.
"[I]t appears that the OFT now intends to second guess and become involved in mergers up to nine years after the 
transaction, only once all EU appeals have been completed," said Ryanair in a statement.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, first acquired a stake in Aer Lingus in 2006 and mounted a public bid for 
its entire shareholding late that year, but the European Commission investigated the bid and decided to prohibit it in 
June 2007.

Body
Britain's Office of Fair Trading resumed its investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in rival Aer Lingus today and 
said it expected to reach a decision by the end of next month.
The OFT began to probe almost a year ago into whether Ryanair's near 30 percent holding in Aer Lingus gave it the 
power to influence the former state carrier's commercial policy and hampered competition.
Ryanair said at the time that the OFT no longer had jurisdiction over the matter and asked Britain's Competition 
Appeal Tribunal to rule on the matter.
The tribunal said last month that the OFT was not out of time to consider making a reference to the UK's 
Competition Commission for investigation and a spokesman for the OFT said it expected to make a decision on or 
before October 26. Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, first acquired a stake in Aer Lingus in 2006 and 
mounted a public bid for its entire shareholding late that year, but the European Commission investigated the bid 
and decided to prohibit it in June 2007. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said the OFT is wasting its time. "We are 
surprised that the OFT continues to waste time and resources on a failed merger offer between two non UK 
companies, some five years after the offer was withdrawn, and some four years after the EU Commission prohibited 
the original offer but confirmed that Ryanair had neither de jure nor de facto control over Aer Lingus. This OFT 
investigation sets a damaging precedent for future UK mergers, as it appears that the OFT now intends to second 
guess and become involved in mergers up to 9 years after the transaction, only once all EU appeals have been 
completed. We believe that this investigation is out of time and we trust that the Court of Appeal will share our view 
and put an end to this unnecessary investigation," he said.

Avolon, says that the financing is important because it opens up new types of debt for the company, and 
demonstrates the ability of the business to access a wider range of lenders.
"Most of our debt deals announced to date have been mortgage-style standard debt structures," he says.
The financings announced today include Avolon's first ever European export credit agency-backed deal, and the 
lessor's first PDP financing. The deals have been closed in the last three months, just as the pricing and supply of 
debt to aviation has become increasingly volatile, with key aviation lenders experiencing pressure on their USD 
funding costs.
"Certainly the past 90 days has been a challenging time to be in the market closing debt deals but we have very 
strong relationships with our lenders and without exception they have all delivered on their commitments." says 
Higgins.
The Avolon executive says that pricing has been trending upwards, but this is not consistent across all banks.
"The pricing picture is yet to become clear. Different banks have differing funding structures and different 
approaches to liquidity costs. We are monitoring it very closely," he says. 
While Air Lease Corporation, which also launched in 2010, successfully completed an initial public offering (IPO) in 
April this year, Higgins says Avolon has no plans in place to do an IPO right now.
$600 million new debt facilities for Avolon
"We are focussed on executing our initial growth phase, which is to grow the fleet to 150 airplanes by 2014. IPO is 
not a priority for the business," he says.
Separately, Avolon announced that it will finance nine narrowbody aircraft for Air Asia and Ryanair with 
sale/leasebacks. Both airlines are first-time customers for the lessor.
Ryanair will take delivery of five new Boeing 737-800s this week on seven-year operating leases, while Air Asia will 
take delivery of two A320s this week on 12-year operating leases, and two additional aircraft in early 2012.
Including these new deals, Avolon says it has now committed to a fleet of 88 aircraft worth more than $4 billion.

Analysis: Is there a secondary market for the superjumbo jet?
Analysis: Is there a secondary market for the superjumbo jet?

Highlight: There will be a secondary Market for the A380 writes, Mark Lapidus, managing director, Doric Asset 
Finance.
Body
Maybe as little as a year or two ago many aviation professionals, if not most, would have said that ''low-cost, long-
haul'' is Freddy Laker's dream and that AirAsia X (the long-haul off-shoot of AirAsia) is Tony Fernandes' ego trip 
and is doomed to struggle. In fact, it seems to be doing well.
However, even diehards of the old aviation order would have taken notice of Singapore Airlines' low-cost start-up 
and Qantas' recent announcements about restructuring. The aviation business is changing to fit into the new 
realities of the global economy.
It is unlikely that the "low-cost, long-haul" segment will conform to the typical low cost carrier (LCC) models people 
associate with Ryanair or EasyJet. It is going to be about low labour costs, as everything else is broadly similar 
between all airlines, and marketing ability to get the formula right.
Air Austral will operate its A380s with more than 840 seats from a small island in the Indian ocean. And Skymark, 
operating from a large island, Japan, will fly with one of the lowest density A380s with only premium economy and 
business class seats. Both are looking to appeal to a price conscious mass market.
Some travellers may be newly affluent, some newly "not as affluent as before", some younger, some older, but all 
with an increasing propensity to travel. Whether to give life a better meaning, or to make a better living, travel 
remains a human imperative.
With these ingredients in mind, the A380 will appeal to many existing and future low-cost operators. For many of 
these, the business will not be about frequencies - it will be about ticket prices, a good flying experience 
commensurate with the price, and keeping costs low.
The key to the A380 is the ability to kit it out for a particular flying formula. With 400 seats or 850, it is a big, 
economical bus and its per-seat economics will remain hard to beat.
For a good flying experience, the A380's scale creates options. It is not just 18.5 inch seats, it may be that 780 
seats with the extra space used for a bar creates the perfect package for yield management. No other aircraft can 
afford to give up that many sellable seats simply to create the right atmosphere on-board.
Analysis: Is there a secondary market for the superjumbo jet?
For cost-conscious operators, fewer frequencies but the same overall passenger numbers also means significantly 
lower crewing and related costs. Air France has reported about (EURO)15 million per year savings by replacing an 
A340-300 and a 777-200 with one A380 on its New York route.
Demand for a 10 year old aircraft
The "low-cost, long-haul" sector will like the A380 more than is currently forecast and quicker than is currently 
anticipated. There will be demand for both new and vintage A380s. The first Singapore Airlines A380s come off 
lease in 2017 and 2018. It is possible that these aircraft could go to its new low-cost subsidiary.
The bigger challenge to the secondary market is essentiality of this aircraft, establishing itself in the operations of 
the major carriers, who have or will have the aircraft and setting this against limited production rates for the type. If 
you have got an A380 to work for you on a route, it is highly cash generative and you will not down-gauge. Once 
British Airways has the taste when it starts operating in 2013, a new large order will come and take out a year or 
more of production. Others will follow.
Traditional lessors have so far shied away from the A380 citing familiar arguments - potentially high reconfiguration 
costs, less liquidity and may be fewer prospective customers, two engine choices, an unknown secondary market. 
But easy transition and a liquid market does not always equate to value.
If the business case makes sense, reconfiguration costs are not going to drive decisions for these low cycle 
airplanes, which, incidentally, repay debt quicker than any other.
Shifting a 777-300 from one first class airline to another's fleet can cost tens of millions; it also can cost nothing 
when instead an emerging market airline buys it for the asking price and puts it into service immediately.
Converting an A380 to an all-economy configuration - bearing in mind that this new aircraft design has specific 
functions reducing variability, and is wired for high speed connectivity with an open system architecture to simplify 
changes to in-flight entertainment - will be very cost efficient..
However, most A380s will stay with their original operator, but with enough of a secondary market out there, with 
strong interest, to keep those trades honest.
Traditional lessors may be right to stay away from the type, for now. Indeed, for their investment model, which 
requires trading out high, buying in low, with short-term financing, it is not a fit.
But for investors who focus on value, they will do well with the A380.

Aer Lingus resists pressure from EU to sell off state's stake
Aer Lingus resists pressure from EU to sell off state's stake

Body
Irish flag-carrier Aer Lingus has ruled out a quick sale of the government's one-quarter stake in the airline despite 
European Union pressure for a deal to ease the heavily indebted nation's finances.
An Irish government report in June recommended selling the national airline along with ports and power stations as 
part of plans to raise EUR5bn (£4.4bn) to repair Ireland's accounts.
Andrew Macfarlane, Aer Lingus' chief financial officer, said he would be "surprised if a deal was to happen in the 
current year". "The likely proceeds would be fairly small compared with the government's financial problems and it's 
hard to see who would be the buyer."
Ryanair, which is keen to purchase the airline, holds a near 30 per cent share in Aer Lingus, the legacy of two 
hostile takeover attempts in 2006 and 2008, which were flatly rejected by the Irish government and European 
regulators as anticompetitive.
The Office for Fair Trading has recently said it will again challenge Ryanair over its shareholding.
The Irish government has pledged to keep at least two airlines crossing the channel to protect tourist numbers: 55 
per cent of Aer Lingus's revenues are derived from customers travelling into Ireland.
Joe Gill, analyst at Bloxham Securities, said: "The Irish government needs reassurances about the strategic links 
provided by Aer Lingus to Ireland so a quick sale of its 25 per cent stake is unlikely."
There are other obstacles to a government sell-off, not least a fractious relationship with the unions, which disrupted 
flights for a month and cost the airline EUR15m in the first half of this year. The group reported an operating loss of 
EUR27.8m for the first half of 2011, up from EUR19m a year ago, as a result of the conflict, which involved a 
dispute over staff rostering changes.
Aer Lingus resists pressure from EU to sell off state's stake
Mr Macfarlane acknowledged that the airline faced the threat of either legal action or further confrontation with 
employees as it sought to resolve a EUR400m pension deficit. Trustees have until the end of this year to propose a 
solution, which is likely to include a cut to benefits or an increase in contributions from the 5,000 employees still 
paying into the 15,000- member fund. Aer Lingus has 3,000 members of staff but the scheme also covers other 
employers at Dublin Airport. "If trustees ask staff to increase contributions we may find ourselves in line for trouble," 
said Mr Macfarlane.
Despite this, Aer Lingus said strong bookings for the second half of 2011 meant its full-year profits would be better 
than expected and the airline was on track to achieve EUR80m of cost savings by the end of the year.
Aer Lingus has recently pulled back from the low-cost airline business model and increased average fares, a 
strategy that paid off with an 8.4 per cent increase in yield per passenger compared with a year ago and despite a 1 
per cent fall in passenger numbers.
  FT Comment 
Aer Lingus's share price has fallen 46 per cent since the start of the year as confidence was dented by the industrial 
action and doubts over its growth potential. But the stock rose more than 9 per cent on Wednesday to EUR0.645 as 
investors endorsed the management's strategy, which has stabilised cash levels in a ropy economy. Despite the 
pension deficit issues, the shares, which trade on 9.7 times earnings for 2011, versus 12 times for the EU airline 
sector, are ready to fly.

Highlight: As the Irish government considers selling a 25% share in Aer Lingus, the Irish Ministry of Transport says 
there will not be a sale this year.
Body
Ryanair has decided not to bid for the Irish government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus. The International Airlines Group 
(IAG) is the most likely bidder at the moment, according to press reports.
Ryanair released a statement yesterday stating that they would welcome another airline acquiring the 25% stake to 
"restore shareholder value, which has been destroyed over the past five years by the board and management of 
Aer Lingus." The statement went on to say that Ryanair would not rule out disposing of their 30% equity if a 
financially sound airline or investor acquired the Irish government's stake.
A spokesperson for the Irish Ministry of Transport said today that any sale of the Irish government's stake would 
have to be ratified by the IMF,EU and ECB. The spokesperson stressed that Aer Lingus would not be sold this year, 
and that a sale is only up for discussion at the moment.
Both IAG and Aer Lingus declined to comment.

IRISH airline Aer Lingus saw a surge in second quarter profits but blamed the effects of industrial action by its cabin 
crew for overall losses in the first half of the year.
The airline, which is owned in part by the Irish government and Ryanair, posted an operating loss of almost 
(EURO)28m (£24.6m) in the year to 30 June compared with (EURO)19m last year.
Following a miserable first quarter when the group made a (EURO)15m loss from cabin crew disputes, the second 
quarter was more positive, with operating profits rising to (EURO)25.9m from (EURO)18.8m a year earlier.
"While we wont reach the same profit levels we reached in 2010 they will certainly be above what we were 
expecting in the first quarter," chief operating officer Stephen Kavanagh told City A.M.
Passenger numbers were up by 8.3 per cent in the second quarter whilst the yield or fare per passenger increased 
6.6 per cent.
The group said that while economic conditions in Ireland "remained challenging", it was confident that a pickup in 
bookings and strong trading prospects meant it would recover to post a better than expected full-year operating 
profit.

Body
Aer Lingus has posted an operating loss of 27.8m euros for the first six months of 2011, as higher passenger yields 
failed to make up for lower passenger numbers.
But CEO Christoph Mueller said its booking profile for the second half of 2011 were better than expected.
"As a result, we are more positive about the profitability of the business in 2011 than we were at the start of the 
year," Mueller said in a statement, without giving a specific forecast.
The airline, which has a far greater exposure to the ailing domestic market than larger Irish rival Ryanair, said its 
average yield per passenger in the first six months was up 8.4 pc on a year ago, but passenger numbers fell 1 pc. 
Mueller said that the airline's performance had been hit in the first quarter by the IMPACT cabin crew dispute. 
However, things had been better in the the second quarter. Operating profit in Q2 rose to 25.9m euros from 18.8m 
euros a year earlier. Pretax profit was higher still for the quarter at 42.2m euros compared to 15.4m euros in 2010. 
Passenger numbers also rose during the quarter by 8.3pc overall, with a rise of 8.6 pc in short haul and 4.8 pc on 
long haul routes. Aer Lingus's share price has fallen 46 pc since the start of the year, compared with a fall of 14 pc 
in the broader Irish market, as confidence was dented by threatened industrial action and doubts about its growth 
potential. Ryanair has seen its share price fall 20 pc in the same period. Aer Lingus's revenue was up 5.8 pc to 
569.1m euro for the six months to June 30. Revenue growth in the second half of 2011 is expected to be broadly 
similar to the first six months, Mueller said. The operating loss before exceptional items of 27.8m euros compared 
with a loss of 19m in the same period last year.

The promotion will be available on return flights, from 13 UK airports to Ryanair's six Irish airports and will apply to 
all flights booked before midnight 30th Sept, for travel between 1st September and 7th November - with fares 
beginning at £14.99 one way.
"Ireland meets and entertains almost 150,000 overseas golfers annually. Golf is one of Ireland's greatest tourist 
attractions, contributing an estimated E110 million to the economy - with Britain as one of our biggest markets 
contributing to that revenue," Failte Ireland's Head of Golf, Keith McCormack said.

Irish shares added this morning to their gains of yesterday, as they track global markets higher.
The ISEQ index was 34.60 points ahead a short time ago at 2,506.11, building on its 41 point gain of yesterday.
The latest upward global trend reflects expectations that key US macro data due this week will ease fears over the 
prospect of another global economic downturn.
Irish Continental shares were ahead by 30c to 1500 a short time ago after it reported a rise in revenue but a fall in 
profits for the first half of the year. CRH is up 7c to 1180 and DCC ahead by 22c to 1817. Elan has edged up by 13c 
to 696 and Kerry Group has added 7c to 2680. Ryanair has lifted by 7c to 307 and Smurfit Kappa has gained 8c to

The ISEQ rose steadily today as bargain hunters descended on key stocks after last week's volatility and as 
investors looked to the US in hope of more measures to stimulate the weak U.S. economy.
The index rose 41.57 points to 2,471.51.
Global stocks rallied along with oil after news of a merger between the top two banks in Greece suggested that 
Europe was working through its financial problems. Surprisingly strong U.S. consumer spending for July - which 
indicated the economy was not falling back into recession - helped sentiment, although weak pending sales of 
existing homes mitigated this somewhat. However, trading volumes across markets were lighter than usual as New 
York City struggled to return to work after the weekend's flooding and power outages, including in the Wall Street 
district, from Tropical Storm Irene. The closure of London markets for a holiday further crimped activity. U.S. crude 
oil futures rose about 2 percent, extending gains from Friday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke left 
the door open last week for further action to stimulate the U.S. economy and fight unemployment.
Grafton's first half (H1) results will be notable as it will be the first announcement under the leadership of new CEO, 
Gavin Slark, who replaced long-standing executive chairman Michael Chadwick (now chairman) at the start of July. 
As per Grafton's interim management statement of July 8th, Davy are forecasting H1 revenues of just under E1bn, 
up 2pc on H1 2010. This included constant currency growth of 4.7pc in the UK while Irish revenues fell 6pc in H1. 
"No other figures were provided, although Grafton did indicate that it continued to "significantly improve its trading 
performance from the historically low levels of the recession". For H1, operating profit of c.E24m and underlying 
EPS of 8c (H1 2010: 7c) would be broadly consistent with our full-year expectations. Given the depressed level of 
housing-related activity in Ireland, nearly all Grafton's profits will continue to be generated in the UK," said analyst, 
Flor O'Donoghue. Grafton's shares were up 8c at E2.78. Following Independent News and Media's (INM) interim 
results on August 26th, Davy are revising their forecasts to reflect a more uncertain outlook. The broker is reducing

cautious outlook for advertising, in Ireland in particular. "For 2012, we expect the group to achieve EBIT of E75.6m." 
INM's shares were unmoved at E0.29. With Ryanair looking at a E500m special dividend in 2013 (after a similar 
payment last year), the announcement that easyJet is considering a £100m payment is probably no surprise. The 
balance sheet will be ungeared at the end of this year, so such a payment, equivalent to a 7pc dividend yield is 
certainly feasible, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers. Shares in Ryanair rose 2c to E3.00. Latest data from RISI 
on containerboard pricing in the German market confirm a further E5/tonne decline in testliner prices in August. The 
fall in testliner prices in Germany in August follows the E15/tonne decline recorded in July, bringing the total fall to 
E20/tonne. The decline is still viewed by most industry players as being largely seasonal in nature, reflecting slower 
summer demand and a confluence of plant re-openings following maintenance shutdowns. Shares in Smurfit Kappa

Regional airports face further subsidy cuts
Regional airports face further subsidy cuts
Sunday Business Post

There has hardly been a more challenging time for Ireland's regional airports.
Dramatic cuts in state support have led to the four main regional airports at Knock, Kerry, Donegal and Waterford 
finding themselves in a highly competitive arena.
All four will be keenly conscious of the fate of Sligo and Galway airports, which will be cut adrift from all state funds 
at the end of this year - as the government attempts to bring greater efficiency to its programme for funding regional 
airports.
Industry analysts unanimously agree that in the medium term, state supports which are a critical element of the 
regional airports' cost structure, are likely to be further cut.
Ryanair's decision to opt out of operating a daily air service between Kerry and Dublin last week came as no 
surprise to keen watchers of both the regional airport sector and Ryanair's interaction with the Department of 
Transport.
It was not the first time the low-cost carrier pulled the plug on flights in and out of Kerry, in an argument over the 
state's subsidy of the Kerry public service obligation (PSO) contract.
Three years ago, Ryanair won the contract to operate the PSO Kerry-Dublin air service, consisting of three daily 
return flights from July 2008 to July of this year, although that arrangement did not last its full term.
For many of the airports, Kerry included, PSO contracts have been worth a great deal in terms of supplying footfall 
to the retail units in their terminals - on which they depend for a large chunk of income.
Some 28 per cent of Kerry's foot traffic is from PSO travellers. For Donegal airport, that figure was over 70 per cent 
in 2009 though just 2 per cent for Knock airport, which will suffer least from the discontinuation of its PSO route 
earlier this year.
Regional airports face further subsidy cuts
The government has been eagerly attempting to drive down PSO costs, but at  17 per passenger the Kerry route 
has consistently been the best performer in PSO terms, compared to  170 per passenger in Knock. However, the 
biggest pinch for the regional airports is likely to come in the form of reduced operational supports, or Opex funding.
The state spent  21.2 million under the Regional Airports Programme in 2010, of which capital supports amounted 
to  1.3 million. A further  4.8 million came in the form of operational supports and  15million was paid out in 
subsidised PSO routes.
The provisional allocation for regional airports this year was  13.4 million, of which  2 million was in the form of so-
called Capex, or capital, funding and the remainder was categorised as 'current' - covering both the PSO and Opex 
supports.
In that context, something had to go on the current funding side and the PSO contracts were the biggest and 
easiest target.
A crucial value for money (VFM) review by the department into the six regional airports last year recommended that 
Opex support should be maintained for only four of them: Donegal, Kerry, Knock and Waterford, but discontinued 
for the West of Ireland's two smaller airports, Galway and Sligo.
The reason given for this recommendation was Galway and Sligo's proximity to Knock and Shannon, both of which 
have bigger airports and longer runways. Knock's runway is longer than that of the state airport in Shannon.
Three months after taking office, transport minister Leo Varadkar announced  5 million in additional funding for 
regional airports for this year, but simultaneously confirmed that from next year Galway and Sligo airports would 
have to survive without state support in either Capex or Opex funding.
Of the remaining four regional airports which will get some operational support, the 2010 VFM review noted in 
favour of Knock and Kerry that both ''stand out from the other regional airports as having good air services 
connectivity in their own right. They have jet runway capacity, which means they can attract more airlines and serve 
more routes than the other regional airports''.
Knock and Kerry also have the most activity. The state's six regional airports counted for five per cent of all 
passenger traffic in the state in 2009. Of this, Knock and Kerry airports accounted for 71 per cent of traffic, 
according to the Department of Transport.
The government will also be conscious that, Knock and Kerry aside, none of the other airports has a record of 
making any significant contribution to inbound tourism, with roughly 2 per cent of travellers to Donegal or Sligo 
travelling there through the local airports in 2008.
Critically, it also noted that recent falling passenger numbers have led to increasing subvention costs per passenger 
on PSO services.
One key line in the 2010 VFM review which stands out is: ''with the exception of Kerry, regional airports are 
increasingly dependent on Opex subvention, even when PSO services are also provided''.
In 2009, for example, the operating cost at Kerry airport was  5.2 million but the airport required no Opex 
subvention; compared to Waterford, which obtained Opex support of almost half its  3.7 million operating cost for 
the same year.
Similarly, Galway and Sligo - soon to be cut adrift - required current supports to the tune of 21 per cent and 27 per 
cent of turnover respectively.
Minister Varadkar has also signalled that he is reluctant to sanction major capital expenditure despite some 
ambitious plans being submitted for development at Knock airport.
Regional airports face further subsidy cuts
In the Mayo airport's defence, it has the second highest return in relation to increasing passenger numbers as a 
percentage of Capex funding from 2000 to 2009.At 3.5 per cent, it is second only to Kerry airport's 7.4 per cent 
return.
None of the other airports passed the 2 per cent mark over the period, indicating that there are limitations to the 
amount of increased traffic which Waterford and Donegal can ever supply without major investment.

Ryanair today announced that it will cease to operate flights on its Dublin - Kerry route from September 7 while 
flights on its Dublin - Cork route will close from the end of October.
It said the decision to cut the routes was made because of a marked decline in traffic on the Cork route as 
motorway improvements have reduced driving times between Dublin and Cork to 2.5 hours.
The airline also blamed the Government's imposition of a PSO subsidised operation on the Dublin - Kerry route 
from 3rd Nov to replace Ryanair's existing commercial flights as well as what it called high charges from the Dublin 
Airport Authority and the Government's E3 travel tax.
"Ryanair regrets having to close our Dublin - Cork and Dublin - Kerry routes. However, passengers have been 
voting with their feet and switching to the convenience of driving 2.5 hours between Dublin and Cork. Meanwhile, 
since this Govt clearly prefers to subsidise high fares with the awarding of yet another pointless PSO on the Dublin - 
Kerry route, Ryanair has been forced to close our unsubsidised low fare flights on this route, from 7th Sept. 
However, All Ireland Football Final flights will operate on 17th, 18th and 19th September," said Ryanair's Stephen

Body
Ryanair has said it has no immediate plans to take up routes being abandoned by budget airline Air Berlin.
The German carrier is cutting back routes and services because of poor demand and a German passenger tax.
Many of the routes concerned are from smaller German airports to the Mediterranean.
While Ryanair is already planning to add winter services from Frankfurt and Munich to Alicante in Spain, its 
spokesman Stephen McNamara said in Dublin this morning that it has been generally cutting German capacity 
since a new aviation tax was implemented. He said Ryanair would carry only 8m passengers to and from Germany 
this year, down from 11 million in 2010. "Until the German market becomes competitive I can't see any big 
increases in capacity by Ryanair," McNamara said. "Some Air Berlin routes may seem attractive but the tax is going 
to be a problem, especially during the winter." Air Berlin is scrapping unprofitable services, cutting frequencies and 
reducing its presence at regional airports to focus on bases in Berlin, Dusseldorf, Vienna and Palma de Mallorca. 
Bloxham Stockbrokers analyst Joe Gill said in Dublin that deeper cuts to Air Berlin's network to the Balearic Islands 
would present the best openings for Ryanair. However, he added that discount carriers would probably bide their 
time to see how far Air Berlin's retreat goes before making significant moves. "I wouldn't assume that the capacity 
cuts that Air Berlin has announced are not themselves the opportunity; I think it's a much deeper opportunity than 
that," he said. "Ryanair is waiting in the shadows to do a deal with anybody if it can get the right metrics with airport 
costs." Among services being terminated by Air Berlin are those from Dusseldorf to Bilbao, from Vienna to Madrid 
and from Palma to the German town of Saarbrucken and to Murcia on the Spanish mainland. Other cuts are at the 
business-focused City Shuttle unit, including Hanover to London Gatwick, Munster to London Stansted and 
Stuttgart to St Petersburg.

Rynair is scrapping its Cork-Dublin route, the only domestic flight left at Cork Airport, according to a report this 
morning.
The route is to be axed in 10 weeks' time, the Irish Examiner says.
It quotes the airline as saying that the decision is due to the improved motorway between the two cities and also 
because of the high charges at the Dublin Airport Authority.
A spokeswoman for Cork Airport tells the paper that the airport is "disappointed" by the news but added it has 
received no formal communication indicating that the flights are ending. She said that there was a drop in 
passenger numbers on the route in recent years but it added that its passenger and landing charges have not 
increased since 2004. Ryanair started a Cork-Dublin route in 2005 with a numbe of flights daily, and its low fares 
eventually pushed other carriers off the route. Cork Airport chief executive, Pat Keohane, recently said domestic 
travel from the airport has fallen by 88pc in the last four years. Mr Keohane said the motorway network had almost 
wiped out domestic air travel. Irish Rail is also offering low fares for passengers who book weeks in advance.

earners become exorbitant. "I start to get pissed off when tax rates get to 60 pc or up to 80 pc. At a certain point,

won't work for that," he said in a wide-ranging interview in his office at Ryanair's Dublin headquarters. As further 
cuts and tax rises are predicted for the up-coming budget, the airline boss -- who earned a salary of 1.1m euros last 
year -- called for the income tax system to be simplified. "Anybody earning under 50,000 euros should pay 10 per 
cent tax," he says. "If you're earning under 100,000 euros, you pay 25 pc and anybody earning over 100,000 euros

## Enterprise minister Richard Bruton is to meet the chief executive of Bank of America in the US next month to

## Housing minister Willie Penrose says it would be "foolhardy" of the government to ignore proposals for a 6bn 
euro debt relief plan for struggling homeowners. Penrose, a "super junior" at the Department of the Environment, 
says the government should give consideration to proposals by economist Morgan Kelly to see whether they could 
help the growing number of households in mortgage arrears and negative equity. - Sunday Times
## Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has warned that he will leave Ireland and become a tax exile if rates for high 
earners become exorbitant. "I start to get pissed off when tax rates get to 60 pc or up to 80 pc. At a certain point, 
people just leave. I would have no compunction about becoming non-resident if the rates went up to 75 or 80 pc. I 
won't work for that," he said in a wide-ranging interview in his office at Ryanair's Dublin headquarters. As further 
cuts and tax rises are predicted for the up-coming budget, the airline boss -- who earned a salary of 1.1m euros last 
year -- called for the income tax system to be simplified. "Anybody earning under 50,000 euros should pay 10 per

Top Irish shares moved positive as a new week began this morning.
The ISEQ index shook off a small early retreat to go 5.78 points ahead to 2,425.55 as mid morning approached.
It was a similar trend on European markets, where early losses among top shares were replaced by gains as trade 
continued.
A short time ago, the FTSE 100 was 1.38pc ahead in London, with the Dax up 0.12pc in Frankfurt and the CAC-40 
gaining 1.14pc in Paris. The apparent collapse of the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli helped balance worries about a 
possible double dip recession in western economies. In Dublin, CRH is up 5c to 1116, with DCC lifting by 6c to 
1761 and Glanbia ahead by 11c to 405. Smurfit Kappa has gained 2c to 493 and Ryanair has risen by 1c to 301. 
Kingspan has dipped by 9c to 578 despite announcing a 37pc rise in first half profits this morning.

Enterprise minister Richard Bruton is to meet the chief executive of Bank of America in the US next month to 
discuss the threat to 750 jobs at the bank's MBNA operation in Co Leitrim.
The meeting with Brian Moynihan has been scheduled to take place on September 22, during a trade mission to the 
US.
Ahead of the meeting, Bruton and his advisors are expected to hold conference calls with Moynihan and other 
senior bank executives over the future of the credit card business in Carrick-on-Shannon. Last Tuesday, Bank of 
America announced plans to exit the MBNA credit card business in Ireland and Britain, resulting in the sale or 
closure of the Leitrim operation.
Barclays, Virgin Money and Santander are seen as potential buyers of the business, which has about $19 billion in 
loans, but there are fears a trade buyer might not retain the Irish workforce.
A spokesman for IDA Ireland said it would help To market the business through its international network. He 
stressed that the process was in its early stages and Bank of America had not decided on its preferred outcome.
If the Carrick-on-Shannon facility cannot be sold as a going concern to another financial services firm, it is 
understood that it could be attractive to outsourcing or IT companies. The facility has high-end IT and call centre 
systems.
A spokeswoman for Richard Bruton confirmed that the minister would meet Moynihan next month. He said that 
Bruton and his officials were ''keeping in touch'' with representatives of Bank of America in the interim.
The MBNA business includes affinity credit cards for Ryanair, Virgin, BT and a number of charities. It is understood 
that MBNA is close to signing a major international firm as a customer, leading to some optimism among employees 
in Leitrim that the company may be an attractive proposition for a buyer.
Bruton to meet bank chief over MBNA's future
Frank Feighan, a local Fine Gael TD, said that ''everyone involved'' had to ensure that the MBNA jobs are retained 
in Carrick-on-Shannon. ''The workers have been very loyal and have made a huge success of this company. I will 
be doing everything in my capacity to ensure the jobs are saved, and so will the government."
It is estimated that the workforce and business generated from the company is worth  35 million to the region.
More than  400,000 in rates are paid by MBNA to Leitrim County Council annually, representing almost 10 per cent 
of all rates collected from businesses in the county.
Bank of America acquired MBNA for $35 billion in 2006, but Moynihan has sold more than 20 of the bank's assets 
in the past year as he refocuses on its core operations. He has said he wants to build a ''fortress balance sheet'' at 
the bank.
