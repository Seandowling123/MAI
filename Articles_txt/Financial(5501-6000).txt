Zurich has pledged to slash emissions from air travel, the latest big employer to seize on working practices 
introduced during the pandemic to cut its carbon footprint.
The Swiss company said yesterday that from next year it would cut emissions generated from flights for employees 
to 70 per cent below pre-pandemic levels, one of a number of changes designed to help the group meet an existing 
goal of halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.
Zurich, which employs 55,000 people in more than 200 countries, said it would achieve the target by holding fewer 
internal meetings that involved travel and using video conference tech.
"The experience of the global pandemic has shown us a pathway to improving many aspects of our daily and 
working lives, and there's no going back," chief executive Mario Greco said.
The move comes as airlines anxiously await the return of lucrative business travel.
The pandemic has forced companies to replace face-to-face meetings with digital communication and cut travel 
budgets.
Some airline executives such as Ryanair's
Michael O'Leary are expecting a full recovery while others such as Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, are 
braced for a 20 per cent reduction in coming years.

Lloyds has pledged to keep emissions from travel to under than 50 per cent of 2019 levels, while Dutch bank ABN 
Amro is aiming to halve its air travel compared with 2017. Consultancies Deloitte and PwC, and consumer group 
Nestle, have pledged to reduce travel.
A permanent reduction would be a big blow to hotels and airlines, given that corporate travel can generate up to 75 
per cent of airlines' revenues on some international flights, according to PwC.

       The major U.S. index futures are currently pointing to a modestly lower open on Wednesday following the 
lackluster performance seen in the previous session.
 The major U.S. averages ended mixed on Tuesday after a somewhat cautious session, with investors weighing the 
likely impact of surging cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus on the pace of the economic recovery.
 The Nasdaq closed at a fresh record high, while the Dow and the S&P 500 drifted lower. Expectations that the 
Federal Reserve will maintain its accommodative monetary policy for a longer duration helped limit the market's 
downside.
 The Dow ended down by 269.09 points or 0.8 percent at 35,100.00. The S&P 500 settled at 4,520.03, recording a 
loss of 15.40 points or 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq ended up by 10.81 points or 0.1 percent at 15,374.33, after 
climbing to a new all-time high of 15,403.44.
 Shares of Boeing (BA) drifted lower after Ryanair said it had ended discussions with the company with regard to a 
proposed purchase of Max 10 jets worth several billion dollars due to differences over price.
 Amgen (AMGN) shares declined more than 2.5 percent following a rating downgrade by Morgan Stanley. Merck 
(MRK), down 1.6 percent, also fell due to a rating downgrade.
 3M (MMM) shed more than 4 percent. Honeywell International (HON), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), 
Walmart (WMT), IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) lost 1 to 2 percent.
 Travelers Companies (TRV) climbed more than 2.5 percent. Walt Disney (DIS) shares gained about 1.8 percent 
and Apple (AAPL) surged up 1.4 percent. Netflix (NFLX) gained more than 2.5 percent, and Amazon (AMZN) ended 
nearly 1 percent up.
 Shares of medical device manufacturer Tandem Diabetes Care (TNDM) soared more than 13 percent, buoyed by 
news the company is set to enter the S&P MidCap 400 effective from September 20.
 Commodity, Currency Markets
 Crude oil futures are jumping $0.93 to $69.28 a barrel after slumping $0.94 to $68.35 a barrel on Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $1,800.40, up $1.90 compared to the previous session's close of 
$1,798.50. On Tuesday, gold plunged $35.20.
 On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 110.19 yen compared to the 110.28 yen it fetched at the close of 
New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is trading at $1.1827 compared to yesterday's $1.1840.
 Asia
U.S. Stocks May Move Modestly Lower In Early Trading
 Asian stocks ended mixed on Wednesday as traders weighed the likely impact of the spread of the Delta variant of 
coronavirus in the region.
 Chinese shares ended on a flat note amid bets that the worst of Beijing's regulatory crackdown has passed. Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng index ended down 0.1 percent at 26,320.93.
 Japanese shares ended near a six-month high after GDP growth for April-June was upwardly revised to an annual 
pace of 1.9 percent from a preliminary estimate of 1.3 per cent. Investors also expressed hopes that the 
coronavirus-hit economy would recover under stimulus packages.
 The Nikkei 225 Index climbed 265.07 points, or 0.9 percent, to 30,181.21, its highest since March 18. The broader 
Topix closed 0.8 percent higher at 2,079.61.
 Heavyweight SoftBank Group jumped 4.6 percent after announcing a $7 billion share-swap deal with Deutsche 
Telekom. Tokyo Electron, Advantest, Rakuten Group and Nikon climbed 2-4 percent.
 Australian shares ended lower alongside a broad commodity sell-off as the greenback strengthened. The 
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 18.30 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,512, while the broader All Ordinaries 
Index ended down 18.90 points, or 0.2 percent, at 7,807.50.
 BHP Billiton fell 1 percent and Rio Tinto dropped half a percent as copper prices hit their lowest level in five

over 1.5 percent on Tuesday, hit by a buoyant dollar and higher yields. Energy stocks saw modest gains as oil 
steadied after a two-day decline.

regulations against online platform giants. The benchmark Kospi fell 24.43 points, or 0.8 percent, to settle at 
3,162.99.
 Tech giant Kakao plunged 10 percent and Naver plummeted 7.9 percent after lawmakers warned the nation's 
internet giants against abusing their market dominance in the pursuit of profits.
 Europe
 European stocks have succumbed to selling pressure on Wednesday amid worries about the slowing pace of the 
global economic recovery due to the rapid spread of the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus.
 Investors also looked ahead to Thursday's European Central Bank meeting that will see policymakers debate a cut 
in its stimulus.
 Governing Council member and Austria's central bank chief Robert Holzmann told Eurofi Magazine that the ECB 
may normalize policy "sooner than most financial market experts expect."
 While the German DAX Index has tumbled by 1.3 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 0.7 percent and 
the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.6 percent.
 Recruitment company Adecco Group AG has moved to the downside a day after it announced the acquisition of 
QAPA.
 Spanish turbine maker Siemens Gamesa has also slumped after JPMorgan downgraded the stock's rating to 
Neutral.
 French drug major Sanofi has also declined. The company said it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to 
buy Kadmon Holdings, Inc. (KDMN), the developer of Rezurock, a recently FDA-approved treatment for chronic 
graft-versus-host disease.
 Biffa has also fallen. The British waste management firm reported that its trading in the first half of the year has 
continued in line with the Board's revised expectations.
 On the other hand, B&M European Value Retail S.A. has moved sharply higher. The variety store company said 
that group revenue to date has been broadly in line with market expectations.
 Avon Protection, a maker of life-critical respiratory and ballistic personal protection systems, has also risen after 
bagging a contract worth up to $87.6 million from the U.S. Army.
 Airlines including EasyJet Plc and Ryanair Holdings have also jumped after reports that the U.K.'s "traffic light" 
travel system could be scrapped from next month.
 Smiths Group has also advanced. The industrial technology company announced that it has agreed the sale of 
medical devices supplier Smiths Medical to ICU Medical, Inc. (ICUI) on terms that are superior to the previously 
announced transaction entered into with TA Associates.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the company will wait for Boeing (BOE.L, 
BOEI.BR) to lower prices before ordering more 737 MAX 10 aircraft, Reuters reported Wednesday.
The Irish budget airline recently terminated talks with the aircraft manufacturer for a potential order of the 737 MAX 
10 jet after the companies failed to reach an agreement on pricing.
O'Leary said Boeing needs to "price competitively," and said there is a chance that the Chinese state-owned 
aerospace manufacturer Comac could become a significant supplier to the airline in the medium term.
"We're not wasting any time on those MAX 10 discussions nor will we for a period of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 years until we get 
to the next crisis," O'Leary said.
Ryanair's shares climbed almost 2% on Wednesday morning.

 The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada and Switzerland have adopted or expanded 
sanctions against Belarus, and the Alexander Lukashenko regime. 
President Biden issued a new executive order that expanded U.S. sanctions authority against Belarus, authorizing 
the designation of government officials, oligarchs and various companies linked to the Lukashenko regime[1]. The 
expanded sanctions authority now encompasses various sectors, including defense, energy, security, 
transportation, cigarette manufacturing, and construction. OFAC expects to implement a broad set of sanctions 
across the Belarus economy[2]. 
The United Kingdom also imposed restrictions including prohibitions on technology, software, dual-use goods, oil 
and gas and tobacco products. The UK prohibitions apply in the territory of UK and all UK persons and companies 
wherever located[3]. 
The EU imposed new restrictions on aviation, and prohibitions on trade in technology items, including artificial 
intelligence and software products.[4] Earlier in the summer, the EU adopted a broad range of sectoral sanctions 
against Belarus. 
Canada adopted revised sanctions relating to securities, money market instruments, debt and various financial 
transactions, along with a robust set of restrictions on oil and gas products. 
Finally, Switzerland introduced new trade prohibitions in the financial sector and products used to monitor internet 
and telephone communications. 
United States and Global Community Adopt Broad Sanctions Targeting Belarus (Part III of IV)
OFAC took immediate steps under the new executive order to sanction 23 individuals and 21 entities, many of 
whom were involved in the crackdown on protesters after last year's disputed election and the government's forced 
landing of a Ryanair flight in May. OFAC announced the new sanctions by stressing that the action was 
unprecedented in scope against Belarus. 
OFAC's sanctions specifically target oligarchs connected to Lukashenko's regime - individuals and entities that 
continue to finance the Lukashenko regime through corrupt activities. These sanctions include oligarch Mikalai 
Varabei and associated companies, former government official Aliaksey Aleksin and associated companies. 
OFAC also sanctioned two major government-owned entities: Belaruskali OAO, a top global producer of fertilizer 
ingredient potassium chloride, and Grodno Tobacco Factory Neman, a tobacco factory and 'major source' of illegal 
cigarettes in the European Union. OFAC issued a general license involving Belaruskali OAO authorizing individuals 
and companies 120 days to wind down transactions. 
The U.S. and international set of sanctions are intended to pressure Belarus to allow an international investigation 
of the Ryanair flight diversion, to release political prisoners, and to refrain from targeting activists who are 
demanding free and fair elections.

Airbus maintains lead over Boeing in deliveries

Airbus (AIR.PA) delivered 40 jets in August to bring supplies of its new jets to 384 since the start of the year, 
remaining broadly on course to meet an annual goal of 600 deliveries that would preserve its crown as no.1 aircraft 
manufacturer.
The European planemaker also sold 269 planes in the first eight months of the year, or 132 after cancellations, 
company data showed on Tuesday.
Fresh sales included 28 narrowbody jets to Latam Airlines (LTM.SN), though South America's largest carrier 
simultaneously cancelled an order for two A350-1000 wide-body jets.
On deliveries, which drive most aerospace revenues, Airbus remains well ahead of U.S. rival Boeing Co (BA.N) 
which is gradually clearing a backlog of undelivered jets following the almost two-year safety grounding of its 737 
MAX.
However, after a lull caused by the MAX crisis and then the industry-wide impact of COVID-19, Boeing remains 
ahead in the number of new orders as U.S. carriers renew their fleets.
As of the end of July, Boeing had sold 630 planes or 270 after adjusting for actual and possible cancellations. 
Orders included more than 524 Boeing 737 MAX by the end of July, compared to Airbus's Jan-August tally of 234 
A320-family jets.
Boeing nonetheless took a knock from one of its largest customers on Monday when Ryanair (RYA.I) said it had 
halted talks to buy up to 250 of the largest variant, the 737 MAX 10, because of a difference with Boeing over 
prices. read more
On Tuesday, Boeing shares fell over 2%.
While the coronavirus pandemic has upended many assumptions about the travel industry, analysts cautioned a 
shock defection by Ryanair to Airbus faces numerous obstacles.
The European firm already has a long waiting list for its competing A321neo and it claims to be commanding higher 
prices, meaning a price war over Ryanair could upset existing customers.
Airbus maintains lead over Boeing in deliveries
Airbus dominates the large single-aisle segment at the centre of the Ryanair-Boeing standoff, while the U.S. 
planemaker has been leading contests against the smaller A320.
After the unusual public spat, Ryanair and Boeing are widely expected to wait each other out before seeing in which 
direction COVID pushes the battered aviation market this winter, with most market sources predicting a 
compromise deal next year.
But in a reminder of the unusual row involving its rival, Airbus data issued on Tuesday confirmed the sale of 36 
A321neo jets to Boeing customer Jet2 - a move that much larger Ryanair has held up as evidence that Boeing 
needs to cut prices further.
Boeing responded on Monday that it would maintain a disciplined approach in airplane negotiations.

       The major U.S. averages ended mixed on Tuesday after a somewhat cautious session with investors weighing 
the likely impact of surging coronavirus of the Delta variant on the pace of economic recovery.
 The Nasdaq closed at a fresh record high, while the Dow and the S&P 500 drifted lower. Expectations that the 
Federal Reserve will hold its accommodative monetary policy for a longer duration helped limit market's downside.
 The Dow ended down by 269.09 points or 0.76 percent at 35,100.00. The S&P 500 settled at 4,520.03, recording a 
loss of 15.40 points or 0.34 percent, while the Nasdaq ended up by 10.81 points or 0.07 percent at 15,374.33, after 
climbing to a new all-time high of 15,403.44.
 Shares of Boeing Inc. drifted lower after Ryanair said it had ended discussions with the company with regard to a 
proposed purchase of Max 10 jets worth several billion dollars due to differences over price.
 Amgen shares declined more than 2.5 percent following a rating downgrade by Morgan Stanley. Merck, down 1.6 
percent, also fell due to a rating downgrade.
 3M shed more than 4 percent. Honeywell International, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, WAlmart, IBM, Verizon 
and Walgreens Boots Alliance lost 1 to 2 percent.
 Travelers Companies climbed more than 2.5 percent. Walt Disney shares gained about 1.8 percent and Apple 
surged up 1.4 percent. Netflix gained more than 2.5 percent, and Amazon ended nearly 1 percent up.
 Shares of medical device manufacturer Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc soared more than 13 percent, buoyed by news 
the company is set to enter the S&P MidCap 400 effective from September 20.
 Other markets
 Asian stocks ended broadly higher on Tuesday, aided by hopes that U.S. interest rates would stay low for longer. 
Trading volumes were thin in the absence of fresh cues from Wall Street, which was closed overnight for a holiday.
 Chinese shares rallied after government data showed the country's exports grew more than expected in August.
 European stocks ended lower on Tuesday after a cautious session amid signs of a slowdown in global economic 
recovery due to the surge in coronavirus cases of the Delta variant.
 Investors also looked ahead to Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank, which may act to slow down its 
massive bond-buying program in light of recent stronger-than-expected inflation data.

A court in Belarus sentenced two opposition activists to decade-long prison sentences yesterday for leading a 
protest movement against strongman president Alexander Lukashenko. Maria Kolesnikova masterminded a 
campaign against Lukashenko in last year's presidential election and then led protests against his dubious landslide 
victory, prosecutors claimed. She was sentenced to 11 years in prison at a closed trial in Minsk.
Maxim Znak, a lawyer who served with Kolesnikova on an opposition leadership council, was sentenced to 10 years 
in a maximum-security facility on the same charges, which included "plotting to seize state power unconstitutionally" 
and "creating an extremist group". The punishments indicate how Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron 
fist since 1994, has used force to secure his hold on the nation of 9.5m following last year's protests.
Security forces dispersed rallies calling for Lukashenko to hand over power - the largest attracted about 200,000 
people - and arrested 35,000 protesters. Many said they were beaten and tortured while in custody. Human rights 
groups estimate that Belarus is holding more than 650 political prisoners.
The crackdown has made Lukashenko, who accused the west of trying to engineer his downfall or assassinate him, 
an international pariah and driven him into the arms of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
The US and EU refused to recognise the election result, which gave Lukashenko 80 per cent of the vote. They also 
imposed sanctions on Belarus for the post-election violence and for forcing the landing of a Ryanair flight carrying a

prominent dissident blogger. Yesterday, the EU said it "deplores the continuous blatant disrespect by the Minsk 
regime of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Belarus" and called for the activists' release.
"The EU will continue its efforts to promote accountability for the brutal repression by the Belarusian authorities," 
the bloc added.
Putin and Lukashenko, whose relationship had hitherto been frosty, have met five times since the protests and held 
several phone calls to discuss strengthening ties. The two presidents plan to sign a "road map" of secretly 
negotiated integration plans in Moscow on Thursday, then observe major joint military exercises on the countries' 
borders with the EU.
A former flautist in Belarus's philharmonic orchestra, Kolesnikova, 39, was a campaign manager for former banker 
Viktor Babariko. He is in prison after being sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment for bribery and tax evasion. After 
Babariko and several other opposition candidates were barred from running, Kolesnikova joined forces with 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the wife of another jailed presidential contender, to mount a surprising challenge to 
Lukashenko. Tsikhanouskaya claimed to have won the vote but fled Belarus days later, saying the country's feared 
KGB had threatened her family.
"We demand the immediate release of Maria & Maksim, who aren't guilty of anything," Tskihanouskaya wrote on 
Twitter. "It's terror against Belarusians who dare to stand up to the regime."

F orget Ryanair. British Airways is the real low-cost airline, at least for carbon offsets. The UK flag carrier offers 
these at almost half the price charged by its Irish rival for some of the same trips.
Both are pricing carbon at big discounts to what industrial companies pay to cover excess emissions. The airlines 
say they are giving passengers the chance to "fully offset" flights and go "carbon-neutral" via payments to 
environmental projects.
Superficially it is a triple win. Environmental charities need the money. Airlines want passengers to share the cost of 
giving aviation a greener gloss. Many travellers yearn to avoid what is called in Swedish flugsham - the guilt of 
contributing to climate change.
The snag is that prices are unrealistically low. If offsets were marketed as financial products, regulators would be 
asking questions about the promises made.
Carbon calculators are at the heart of the issue. You can see why an increasing number of airlines, from JetBlue to 
Lufthansa to Cathay Pacific, build these into online sales systems. For customers, it feels nice to hit a button and 
generate an offset price they can add to their flight package. Particularly when prices are so affordable.
BA was last week quoting £1.72 ((EURO)2) to offset a return trip in economy class from London to Alicante. 
Ryanair's website quoted (EURO)5.67. BA offsets for long-haul trips are even cheaper per mile than short-haul 
offsets - under £10 to fly to Hong Kong and back.
Airline schemes to take sting out of 'flight shame' don't add up
I calculate that BA is pricing carbon at (EURO)8-(EURO)10 a tonne. I reckon Ryanair is closer to (EURO)18 per 
tonne. EU and UK industrial companies are meanwhile paying around (EURO)56 per tonne via emissions trading 
schemes.
Defenders of carbon offsets complain that I am comparing apples and pears. They say governments limit the supply 
of permits to make emissions to push prices up. Quite so. Unless prices are higher, there is no chance climate 
change will be arrested.
It is questionable whether many of the carbon sequestration projects that provide cheap offset certificates have the 
financial heft to lock up as much of the stuff as claimed.
Many travellers to avoid what in Swedish the guilt of to climate
One scheme I looked at provides clean drinking water in Africa, for example. Sinking boreholes and digging wells 
are great projects that are well worth backing. But I am unconvinced by the argument that these qualify as offsets 
by reducing heavily the amount of wood burnt to sterilise drinking water. Years ago, I lived in an Indian village as a 
development volunteer. People there did not have the fuel or the time to boil drinking water.
Forestry schemes look like a clearer way to reduce carbon, by turning it into trees. But in developed nations these 
often "preserve" woodlands that might not be cut down anyway. Planting trees where they are absent looks like a 
better bet. After all, a tree supposedly sequesters upwards of 10kg of carbon a year, getting it to a running total of 
around a tonne in a century.
Logic peters out, however, when you ponder the task facing latter-day Johnny Appleseeds. Suppose they sought to 
plant enough trees to soak up all aviation's yearly emissions. My backof-an-envelope figuring suggests these 
gallant arboriculturists would need to cover an area roughly the size of Norway with saplings before protecting them 
from loggers, drought and wildfires for the requisite 100 years. I doubt you can do that for (EURO)10 per tree.
Sola Zheng of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a US nonprofit organisation, argues offsets are a 
way of outsourcing aviation's climate challenges to other sectors. She thinks airlines should focus on alternative 
fuels and using them efficiently.
Airlines would riposte that they are already doing that. My feeling is that voluntary carbon offset schemes could help 
build public awareness of the cost of arresting climate change if they used credible numbers and were more 
transparent.
First, airlines need to disclose clearly the assumptions behind their online calculators. Second, these gizmos need 
to spit out a carbon price somewhere roughly in the same postcode as the figure produced by emissions trading 
schemes. Aviation bodies can help by setting tougher guidelines.
There is no push for carbon offsets to be regulated like financial products. That is just as well, given the likely 
overheads. But it is time for the industry to be far more realistic about what it is marketing and for how much.

F orget Ryanair. British Airways is the real low-cost airline, at least for carbon offsets. The UK flag carrier offers 
these at almost half the price charged by its Irish rival for some of the same trips.
Both are pricing carbon at big discounts to what industrial companies pay to cover excess emissions. The airlines 
say they are giving passengers the chance to "fully offset" flights and go "carbon-neutral" via payments to 
environmental projects.
Superficially it is a triple win. Environmental charities need the money. Airlines want passengers to share the cost of 
giving aviation a greener gloss. Many travellers yearn to avoid what is called in Swedish flugsham - the guilt of 
contributing to climate change.
The snag is that prices are unrealistically low. If offsets were marketed as financial products, regulators would be 
asking questions about the promises made.

 CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts 
at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:
BA shares underperformed today on  news of Ryanair ending talks for a 737 MAX order and separately that 787 
deliveries are unlikely to resume before October. We encourage investors not to overreact, especially to the 
Ryanair negotiations, as this type of maneuvering is common in aircraft purchase negotiations. In fact, Ryanair has 
snubbed BA in the past, breaking off talks in 2009 and also in 2011 when it made a design agreement with Chinese 
planemaker, COMAC. Neither setback  ultimately ended Ryanair's commitment to an all-737 fleet, however, as the 
airline went on to make large 737 orders in 2013, 2014,  2018, and 2020. We are actually encouraged that BA is 
seeing enough worldwide 737 demand to hold firm on pricing rather than make the steep concessions Ryanair likely 
wanted. The 787 delays continue to disappoint us, but we had previously penciled in a December resumption of 
deliveries to be conservative, so news of the delivery halt stretching to October does not impact our estimates or 
price target.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said on Monday that it has failed to reach an agreement with Boeing (BA) for a large 
follow-on order for the US-based aerospace manufacturer's MAX10 aircraft due to disagreements on pricing.
"Both sides have agreed to waste no more time" following 10 months of talks, the Ireland-based budget carrier said 
in a statement.
Ryanair has ordered over 200 B737 "Gamechanger" aircraft, with deliveries expected over the next five years, 
according to a statement.
"Boeing have a more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track record of not 
paying high prices for aircraft," Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said.

 Welcome to B-Day, the beginning of the grand cryptocurrency experiment for El Salvador, which 'became the first 
country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday.' Predictably, 'the launch got off to a bumpy start 
online early' this morning - WSJ[1] and Bloomberg[2] and Marketplace[3] 
A new bill that passed the California House in May and is heading to the Senate this week would 'require 
warehouse employers like Amazon to disclose productivity quota for workers, whose progress they often track 
using algorithms' and ban 'any quota that prevents workers from taking state-mandated breaks or using the 
bathroom when needed.' Business groups have pushed back hard on the measure, and the Senate could water 
down some of the bill's more stringent requirements - NYTimes[4] 
Those tracking the effect of the Delta variant on business need look no further than the travel industry to see how 
the rise in infections is throwing a wrench in what some had expected would be an autumn return to normalcy - 
WSJ[5] 
Chinese microblogging platform Weibo cited unauthorized fund-raising as the reason to shut down nearly two-
dozen K-Pop fan accounts amidst a recent wave of 'broader government crackdown[6] on celebrity worship and 
online fan culture in China' - NYTimes[7] 
Elsewhere, Chinese President Xi Jinping is putting into words what the government action has already made quite 
clear: it's now time to reverse the growing economic inequality in his country, and he won't be shy about targeting 
the rich in order to do so - NYTimes[8] 
JD.com founder Richard Liu will 'step back from day-to-day business to focus on longer-term strategy and 
mentoring young managers' at the Chinese e-commerce company as part of a series of recent moves that included 
the company naming its first president - WSJ[9] and MarketWatch[10] 
Financial Daily Dose 9.7.2021 | Top Story: El Salvador Adopts Bitcoin as National Currency
Food giant KraftHeinz will pay the SEC $62 million 'to resolve an investigation into years of alleged accounting 
improprieties and inflated earnings reports' while neither admitting nor denying the agency's claims as part of the 
deal - Law360[11] 
Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess kicked off the week by raising concerns that the chip shortage causing delays 
throughout the auto industry could be a fact of life for 'months or even years' to come' - Bloomberg[12] 
An overview of the CFPB's 'expansive new data collection regime intended to help fight discrimination and promote 
equality in the $1.4 trillion small business lending market' that it released last week - Law360[13] 
Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier that's Boeing's 'biggest customer outside of the U.S.,' is ending negotiations with 
the American planemaker 'over a potential new order for the 737 MAX in a dispute over pricing.' The announcement 
ends 10 months of talks between the parties and delivers a blow to Boeing, which has been beset with production 
delays and safety problems for years - WSJ[14] and MarketWatch[15] 
We've talked plenty here over the years about both the desperate search for yields and the questionable 
independence of rating agencies. So maybe it was inevitable that the former's now pushing past the latter 
altogether, with some money managers rolling the dice on bonds that have no rating whatsoever (pointing out that 
they're not necessarily 'more likely to default' but rather are unrated because they 'require[] more research,' are 
'less liquid' or are 'more difficult to trade') - WSJ[16] 
A Labor Day look from the Times at recent moves by some companies to introduce 'wellness weeks' in an effort to 
address employee burnout and retain workers rather than unknowingly shove them out the door - NYTimes[17] 
Join us in embracing a bit of Tuesday Twee as we dip into Wes' world in anticipation of the coming 'French

Boeing: Trade Me Deadly 
I went to a party last Saturday night. I didn't get picks got in a fight. Uh-huh it ain't no big thing. 
 Ryanair killed an order; Boeing prices are bad. Can't borrow ten bucks from your old man? 
 Uh-huh it ain't no big thing. 
 But I know what I like. I know I like trading with you, Great Ones. And I know what you like. I know you like trading 
with me. 
 Okay that's enough Lita Ford[1] for one day. 
 But Mr. Great Stuff there's never enough Lita Ford! 
 I 
hear 
you, 
but 
we 
have 
to 
talk 
about 
Boeing 
(NYSE: 
BAhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=ba&#38;checkSymbol=true) 
and 
Ryanair 
(Nasdaq: 
RYAAYhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=ryaay&#38;checkSymbol=true). I mean, Boeing is a Great Stuff 
Picks holding after all. 
 So, BA stock fell more than 2% today after Ryanair canceled a 737 MAX 10 order[2] reportedly worth billions. 
According to Ryanair, it canceled the order because it was unable to agree on price: 
We are disappointed we couldn't reach [an] agreement with Boeing on a Max 10 order. However, Boeing have a 
more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track record of not paying high 
prices for aircraft. 
That was Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, who also speculated that high prices were the reason customers such as 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DALhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=dal&#38;checkSymbol=true) and others were 
moving to Airbus in recent months. 
 And that may be true or it could be that Boeing still has a bit of a PR problem given the 737 MAX issues and the 
787 Dreamliner delays. 
 But I'm pretty certain that none of these issues are why Ryanair just canceled its 737 MAX 10 order. I don't think 
Boeing's pricing is even the issue for Ryanair. 
Boeing Catches Ryanair , Match Strikes Tinder & Terminator X It
 During the same announcement where O'Leary bemoaned Boeing's pricing, he also said that Ryanair had 'more 
than sufficient order pipeline' to meet its growth plans for the next five years. 
So, here's a question: Why would you buy more planes if you already have enough for your growth plans for the 
next five years? Throw in COVID-19 uncertainty over the short term, and you have your answer: There's no reason 
for Ryanair to buy more planes. 
 Sure, Ryanair would love to pick up a couple planes here or there if the price is right. But it already has its needs 
met for the next half-decade. 
 What I believe Ryanair is really saying here is that it won't grow enough to use or need those extra Boeing 737 
MAX 10s. It just doesn't want to come out and tell investors that directly. Telling investors that you won't grow 
enough is bad news bears — even if it's to tell investors you thought about buying more planes but decided you 
didn't need them. 
 So, why not blame Boeing's pricing? After all, Boeing is everyone's whipping boy lately. Who'd notice that you're 
not growing fast enough to need the planes you thought you needed? 
 It's the perfect smokescreen for Ryanair. 
 So, fear not Great Stuff Picks readers. Boeing will be just fine. Remember, we're in this one for the long haul. 
Boeing is a blue chip. It will gain more ground.

 Good: I SPOT A Bull Rally? 
 Don't 
call 
it 
a 
comeback, 
but 
remember 
when 
I 
said 
Spotify 
(NYSE: 
SPOThttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=spot&#38;checkSymbol=true) might've finally caught a break with 
investors? When the sheer exuberance of a billion-dollar share buyback sent SPOT shares[5] up 5%? 
 Well, at long last a whole two weeks later analysts on the Street are coming around to the music-streaming stock. 
SPOT is up 4% today because Keybanc analysts Justin Patterson and Sergio Segura upgraded the stock from 
sector weight to overweight[6], since suddenly they think Spotify's business 'is in a stronger position.' 
 Wow, it took two of you to come up with that? 
 Keybanc also backed up its equivalent of a buy rating by pointing out Spotify's improving user growth, which is a 
valid point. As much as I've complained about Spotify and its constantly changing and boneheaded user interface 
it's really the only game in town for music streaming. 
 Apple Music has its walled garden that Android users typically couldn't care less about, and YouTube Music gets 
some subs on both sides of the mobile OS aisle. But Spotify gets them all no matter how bad its app-building is. 
 I agree with Keybanc's thoughts on user growth, and this is usually the part of the Spotify conversation where I 
remind you that the company has yet to turn that user growth into substantial earnings growth. 
 But in a surprising turn of events, let's forget all of that fundamental nonsense and get technical. I know, math after 
a long weekend? It's inhumane — torture! 
 But is now the right time to buy SPOT stock, like Keybanc recommends? After the stock's 25% rally off of those 
share buybacks? I mean, jeez, even Spotify timed that buy better, Keybanc 
 SPOT shares just broke out of a downtrend of lower highs and lower lows and are now heading toward resistance 
at $270. What this sets up is another short-term peak for SPOT. So, while analysts might be right about Spotify's 
sub growth, which will be good for the company right now is far from the best time to buy in. 
 If you were bullish on SPOT, I'd wait until it pulls back to $250, see if buying support is really there after all and 
then look to buy in. 
Better: I Got Bugs Bugs In My Room 
 Spotify isn't the only stock jumping higher on that ever-elusive analyst attention. No, today's other top dog on the 
Street 
is 
pest-control 
expert 
Terminix 
Global 
(NYSE: 
TMXhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=tmx&#38;checkSymbol=true). If you couldn't tell, this week is starting 
sloooow. 
Boeing Catches Ryanair , Match Strikes Tinder & Terminator X It
 This might be the first time we've talked about Terminix in Great Stuff — frankly, what is there to say? It kills bugs. 
That's it. And I try and avoid thinking about the creepy crawlies myself until I'm called to the domestic front line for 
bug or spider duty. 
 BofA Securities Analyst Gary Bisbee believes that TMX's recent 20% post-earnings sell-off makes the stock a 
buying opportunity. Bisbee double upgraded TMX from underperform to buy[7] and raised his price target from $47 
to $49. 
 TMX is up 7% on the news, and while a double upgrade is all nice and dandy, none of this is what I wanted to talk 
about today with Terminix. BofA rates Terminix higher as a turnaround play, which is fine but what if there was a 
more interesting angle to investing in Terminix? 
 Surprise: It's climate change. 
 Hotter temperatures mean more bugs in your house. And personally, I'm a bit tired of being the resident 
exterminator. (Shout-out to my palmetto-bug-killing Great Ones out there — everybody's a gangster until the roach 
flies at your face.) 
 Terminix will face increasing demand as bug problems get worse. You can try to DIY pretty much every other home 
improvement or repair situation but pest control? Leave it to the brave and willing. 
 You don't have to be an ultra-prepper, getting your bunker ready, to start thinking about climate change plays. I'm 
sorry we had to get all apocalyptic today, but what are you gonna do. Some say the only things left after the world 
ends will be the roaches and Ozzy running Terminix. Whether Keith Richards is on Ozzy's side or the roaches' side 
remains to be seen. 
 So, short of snatching up property around the Great Lakes, what else can you do to keep making bank as the Earth 
burns to a crisp? Buy pest control stocks, apparently. At least we're not getting into water futures[8] or pulling a 
Nestl. 
Best: Love Is All You Need 
 Once upon a time — way back in the olden days before the internet took over everything — you actually had to 
leave your house and participate in the real world to date someone outside of your immediate social circle. Oh, the 
horror! 
 Sure, dating wasn't all chance romantic encounters in bookstores and coffee shops like '90s rom-coms would have 
you believe but there was a certain je ne sais quoi in not knowing when Cupid's arrow might strike. 
 But 
now, 
thanks 
to 
online 
dating 
companies 
like 
Match 
Group 
(Nasdaq: 
MTCHhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NASDAQ%3AMTCH), you can find your future life 
partner from the comfort of your own home or at least someone to go see the new Spider-Man: No Way Home 
movie with. (Seriously, this movie looks amazing[9]!) 
 For all you Great Ones blissfully avoiding the online dating scene, Match Group is the parent company of dating 
pioneer Match.com. But the brand has grown to include popular dating apps Tinder, Hinge, Plenty of Fish and 
OkCupid, among others[10]. 
 Investors of Match Group were feeling the love this morning after the company's stock rose 7% following news that 
Match will be added to the S&#38;P 500 Index[11] on September 20. 
 Apparently, the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly kind to Match Group, as the dating conglomerate saw a 
surge of new users while people were stuck in lockdown. And here we've all been whining about the ongoing chip 
shortage — love is in the air, Great Ones[12]! 
 But won't Match's business slow down now that people can go outside again, Mr. Great Stuff?  
 Not according to Match Group. In fact, the company expects business to boom now that people can go outside and 
meet their matches at bars and restaurants again. And here I thought love was dead. 
 What about you, Great Ones? Have you ever used an online dating app? Or do you prefer to do things old school 
and meet potential beaus out in the wild? Let us know at GreatStuffToday@BanyanHill.com [13].; 
Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDAhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=nvda&#38;checkSymbol=true) is this close to 
becoming a fully ARMed and operational battle station. This close, I tell you. 
 But NVDA investors (that's all y'all Great Stuff Picks readers, mind you) know that the company's mission to buy 
out chip designer ARM looks less and less like the Death Star we wanted and more like the remnants of Alderaan. 
 Last we checked in on the chipmaking couple[14], it was up against a battery of regulatory scrutiny in the U.K. Yes, 
it's been literally a year since Nvidia first entered the antitrust limelight and we didn't even get to the EU's approval 
yet. 
Boeing Catches Ryanair , Match Strikes Tinder & Terminator X It
 So, how's that U.K. approval going? To shreds, you say? 
 Approval in the U.K. has been anarchy (I wanna beeeeEEE). The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority — aka 
the CMA, a regulatory watchdog — isn't keen on passing the buyout. Or, as one person with direct knowledge of 
the deal puts it[15]: 
The CMA has been very aggressive. If they are not willing to accept [the] concessions, it will be a matter of trying to 
convince them until the very end. It will go down to the wire. 
And here I thought the deal was already down to the wire. Clearly, Nvidia's '18-month timeline' ain't happening. 
Especially not with fresh fury now brewing among European regulators. 
 And the EU approval oh, to shreds, you say. 
 Yeah Nvidia is filing for approval in the EU this week, but it looks as dubious as the U.K. hassle, unfortunately. 
According to one unnamed EU official: 
It's not certain the deal will get easily cleared here. 
The EU filing is the only 'new' news here: If you've held NVDA this long, you've heard the same doubtful spiel 
before. 
 Antitrust critics still think that Nvidia will cut off licensees' access to ARM's chip tech once the deal is signed, sealed 
and delivered — essentially making Nvidia 'uncompete-able,' if you will, and screwing over the many other 
chipmakers and tech companies that use ARM's chip designs. 
 For its part, Nvidia denied that it would ever do such a malicious, monopolistic thing — the nerve of you to assume 
that! 
 But now there are two regular unknowns hanging over Nvidia's head today: the U.K. and the EU regulators. And 
you know how much Wall Street loves unknown variables, antitrust issues and the ensuing uncertainty 
 Anyway the good news, Great Ones, is that we know Nvidia's chipmaking prowess is strong enough to keep 
driving solid earnings without the extra ARM. Should the buyout get struck down by the EU or U.K., Nvidia would 
keep chugging along as it was before just not as dominantly. 
 With how much Wall Street hates uncertainty, the biggest risk for NVDA investors might not be whether the deal is 
blocked but how long the regulatory thumb-twiddling rhetoric drags on. 
 We'll keep you looped into the NVDA situation, Great Ones. And while we're at it, you should keep me in the loop 
of all the greatness happening in your own portfolio.

Ryanair drops plan to buy Boeing MAX10 planes
Ryanair drops plan to buy Boeing MAX10 planes

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has pulled out of talks to buy another batch of Boeing Corporation 737 MAX jets, 
saying the US aircraft maker was being unrealistic over prices.
The news will be a blow to Boeing as Ryanair has been a staunch supporter of the troubled aircraft and is one of 
the plane's largest customers.
Ireland-based Ryanair has already ordered 210 737 MAX-8 aircraft, which can carry 197 passengers, but this latest 
order would have been for an additional 200 of the 230-seat MAX-10.
"We are disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement with Boeing on a MAX10 order," Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
"However, Boeing have a more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track 
record of not paying high prices for aircraft," he said.
"We do not share Boeing's optimistic pricing outlook, although this may explain why in recent weeks other large 
Boeing customers such as Delta and Jet2, have been placing new orders with Airbus, rather than Boeing," he 
added.
The MAX has only recently been given clearance to resume flying again after two fatal crashes saw it grounded for 
twenty months.
O'Leary is one of the plane's biggest backers and has often described the MAX as a game-changer for his airline.
Ryanair drops plan to buy Boeing MAX10 planes
"These new Boeing 737 aircraft will help Ryanair lower costs, cut fuel consumption and lower noise and CO2 
emissions," he said in June when it received its first MAX-8 delivery.
"Each B737 aircraft offers 197 seats (compared to our 189-seat current 737 fleet)."
Shares in Ryanair today rose 1.1% to (EURO)16.08.

Ryanair Holdings plans to return to pre-pandemic capacity Europe-wide in October 2021 but expects to move a 
sizeable part of its operations from Ireland to other markets, where governments are more supportive of the tourism 
industry, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
"As long as there are no adverse COVID developments, things are set fair for a very strong recovery," O'Leary told 
Reuters.
He added that demand and pricing are expected to lag while capacity will return to pre-pandemic levels this fall. In 
the fourth quarter of 2021, Ryanair hopes to see an 80-85% average load factor, around 10 points below historical 
levels. Both load factors and fares are forecast to fully rebound by summer 2022.
However, while the system-wide recovery is progressing smoothly, O'Leary pointed out that not all markets would 
rebound equally. In particular, he slammed the Irish government's policies, accusing it of not doing enough to 
support inbound tourism. As a result, Ryanair could move 10-20% of its Irish capacity to other markets.
"I would be very worried for Irish tourism. There is no agenda for transport in this country. Ireland is an island on the 
periphery of Europe. Aviation and tourism should be front and centre of government policy... But Ireland is sitting on 
its hands. [Minister of Transport] Eamon Ryan doesn't give a shite about aviation," O'Leary said.
He criticised the lack of support for the Dublin Airport Authority, which, in turn, has been prevented from offering 
steep discounts to airlines to attract more traffic. However, Ryan responded that the government has earmarked 
EUR130 million euros (USD154.2 million) for the DAA and regional Irish airports but could not force them to use the 
funds to finance discounts for airlines during a period when there is little demand to attract them in the first place.
For now, the ch-aviation capacities module shows, Dublin Int'l remains the second largest airport in Ryanair's 
network with a 3.9% share by weekly departure capacity. Only London Stansted is a more significant point of origin 
for the low-cost carrier.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) on Monday said it ended discussions with Boeing (BOE.L) for a potential order of the 
latter's MAX10 aircraft after the companies failed to reach an agreement on pricing. 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said the company "[does] not share Boeing's optimistic pricing outlook, 
although this may explain why in recent weeks other large Boeing customers, such as Delta and Jet2, have been 
placing new orders with Airbus, rather than Boeing."
O'Leary previously said the company was "very keen" on placing an order of up to 200 aircraft. 
The European airline said it will still receive its order of 210 B737 Gamechanger aircraft from Boeing through 2025.
Shares in Ryanair rose 1%, while Boeing fell 1% in morning trade.

Ryanair says ends talks with Boeing on large 737 MAX order
Ryanair says ends talks with Boeing on large 737 MAX order

Ryanair has ended talks with Boeing on a major new order for Boeing 737 jets due to a disagreement over pricing, 
the Irish airline said on Monday.
The budget giant is already the largest European customer for the 737 MAX, with 210 firm orders of the 197-seat 
MAX 8-200 model. It has said it could order up to 250 of the 230-seat MAX 10 for delivery from around 2025.
A large order from Ryanair would provide a major boost to U.S. planemaker Boeing and its MAX, which was 
grounded for 20 months, up to last November, after two fatal crashes. It would also boost an industry grappling with 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last week, Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary poured cold water on the chances of a quick deal, 
saying he would be surprised if agreement was reached before next year.
On Monday, he said talks had collapsed without any agreement on pricing.
"We are disappointed we couldn't reach agreement," O'Leary said in a statement.
"However, Boeing have a more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track 
record of not paying high prices for aircraft."
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The breakdown in negotiations - at least for now - means there will be no quick deal that would have provided a 
major vote of confidence in the MAX, but Ryanair did not say it was planning to hold talks with rival Airbus, the only 
realistic alternative supplier.
O'Leary, one of Boeing's most loyal customers, in recent years has repeatedly played down the prospect of a deal 
with Airbus due to the manufacturer's heavy backlog of orders.
In Monday's statement O'Leary did refer to the fact that other Boeing customers had done deals with Airbus.
Britain's Jet2 last week closed a deal for 36 A321 neo aircraft worth about $4.9 billion.. Delta in August added 30 
A321neo narrowbody aircraft to its order book with Airbus.
Ryanair says ends talks with Boeing on large 737 MAX order
Boeing's more optimistic pricing outlook "may explain why in recent weeks other large Boeing customers such as 
Delta and Jet2, have been placing new orders with Airbus," O'Leary said. Delta has a mixed fleet of Airbus and 
Boeing jets.
Industry analysts noted Boeing has nonetheless had a series of major orders for the MAX in recent months 
including 150 of the 737 MAX-10 from U.S. carrier United Airlines.
Some analysts say the public standoff suggests that recent orders have given Boeing increased confidence to 
defend a red line on pricing as the MAX regains commercial momentum.
That contrasts with the pattern seen around six months ago when the MAX was reported to be available at 
aggressive prices.
Ryanair, on the other hand, is gambling that its supplier will come to the table with a better offer as continued 
pressure from the pandemic adds to the fallout from the MAX crisis.
How the tug of war over prices plays out will depend in part on the progress of efforts to contain COVID-19 in 
coming months.
Despite the public row, "it is likely Boeing and Ryanair will eventually cut a deal," a senior industry source said.

Airlines share turbulence continues despite flights recovery
Airlines share turbulence continues despite flights recovery

Airline shares were caught in crosswinds again even though the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics 
confirmed a strong rebound in the number of flights.
In the seven days to 29 August, the average number taking off rose to 3,405 or the highest number since the start 
of the pandemic.
Total flights though are still down by more than 50% since pre-pandemic and nervousness over the future with the 
spread of infections and almost daily reports of new variants of Covid-19 are suppressing any enthusiasm to buy 
into the air sector recovery, said analysts.
A new coronavirus strain named Mu and first identified in Colombia has been designated a variant of interest by the 
World Health Organisation (WHO).
Cases have been recorded in South America and Europe as has another variant C.1.2, though the WHO has yet to 
list this as a variant of concern even though it has received widespread media coverage.
The recent decision by the EU to re-impose restrictions on non-essential travel from the US has also dampened 
investor enthusiasm for the sector.
British Airways has traditionally done well out of transatlantic travel and its share price has slipped from 217p in 
March to 158.2p, down 1% today.
Airlines share turbulence continues despite flights recovery
Ryanair was one of the few not to drop today as it echoed the bullish tone of the ONS data with its numbers for 
August.
The airline recently upped its estimate for passengers this year and said that August traffic increased to 11.1mln 
from 7mln a year ago and 9.3m in July 2021, with a load factor of 82%, the fullest its planes have been since March 
2020.
A trading update from low-cost airline Jet2 added that the restrictions on travel meant people were booking 
"significantly closer to departure" this summer.
The low-cost carrier said it has seen momentum slow for winter deals due to concerns about restrictions tightening 
again and also the costs of travel, though advanced demand for next year's summer season was encouraging.
Prices needed to remain 'enticing' to encourage people to fly, it added.
Wizz Air, meanwhile, carried 3.58m passengers last month, up 50% on twelve months ago at 84% of capacity.
EasyJet shares fell 0.5% to 793p, Jet" 1% to 1,181p though Ryanair rose 0.6% to (EURO)16.09.

John Menzies, the aviation services group, said yesterday that the recovery in travel was gaining pace.
However, it said volumes for its ground services and fuelling business remained muted and were unlikely to return 
to pre-pandemic levels for another two years.
The cautious optimism was in contrast to the bullish predictions 24 hours earlier of Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary, who expects the carrier to return to pre-pandemic passenger numbers this winter.
Volumes for ground services at Menzies were 62 per cent lower in the first half of the year compared with the same 
period in 2019, while fuelling services dropped 45 per cent.
However, air cargo services were more resilient, with volumes handled for the period 9 per cent above 2019 levels.
John Geddes, corporate affairs director at the FTSE 250 group, said the company, which provides cargo handling 
services, refuelling and aircraft maintenance at more than 200 airports, was generally "very positive", but "you've 
got to be realistic as well".
He said: "We are still looking at a business that is 60 per cent down on volumes from 2019. We see that returning, 
and it is just a question when that returns."
Geddes said volumes in the UK remained "very, very low".

The company, along with other air services groups, is continuing to lobby ministers for further support.
The government in January announced the launch of a scheme for commercial airports and ground handlers in 
England affected by the drop in travel. It provides support up to the equivalent of a company's business rates 
liabilities or Covid losses, whichever is lower, for the 2020-21 financial year.
According to Geddes, the scheme's design meant it was "unfortunately 99 per cent fit for airports and 1 per cent fit 
for handlers", as the latter were services businesses without property.
Geddes was speaking as the company announced it had swung to profit in the first six months of the year as it 
benefited from the results of a restructuring as well as government support.
It said pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of June was £4.7m compared with a pre-tax loss of £80.1m for the 
first half of 2020.
Underlying pre-tax profits, excluding exceptional and other one-off items, were £10.9m compared with a loss of 
£48.7m the year before. However, revenues for the period fell to £415.8m, compared with £431.5m in 2020.
Geddes said the restructuring would deliver up to £25m of annualised cost savings on a permanent basis. The 
group would be in a "more profitable business once volumes return".

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) saw passenger numbers in August boosted by EU Covid certificates.
The Irish airline said traffic rose to 11.1 mln passengers in August, up from 9.3mln in July and 7mln in the same 
month of 2020, when air travel was severely hit by restrictions related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The EU Covid Certificates are stimulating a recovery in the travel industry, Ryanair said in a statement.
The airline's load factor - the percentage of seats filled - was 82% in August, compared with from 80% in July and 
73% in August last year.
Earlier this week, Ryanair raised its traffic forecast for the rest of the year to 10.5mln passengers a month in 
September, October and November, from a previous estimate of 10mln.
"As long as there are no adverse Covid developments, things are set fair for a very strong recovery," Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters.
Flights should return to pre-COVID-19 2019 levels in October, he added, from close to 90% in September and 80% 
in August, though the airline will likely fly with 15-20% empty seats this winter compared with 7-8% before the 
pandemic.

(Alliance News) - Both Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC saw an uptick in passenger numbers in 
August as the travel sector benefits from Europe's vaccination progress. 
Irish budget airline Ryanair on Thursday reported August traffic of 11.1 million at a load factor of 82%, operating 
over 71,000 flights in the month. 
August's stats marked an improvement on July, when it flew 9.3 million passengers at a load factor of 80%. In 
August 2020, Ryanair saw 7.0 million passengers and registered a load factor of 73%.
Ryanair noted that the EU's Covid certificates have helped to stimulate air travel recovery.
Central and eastern Europe-focused airline Wizz Air, meanwhile, said it carried 3.6 million passengers at a load 
factor of 83.6% in August. The traffic figure was up 50% on a year ago, while load factor notched a 12.7 percentage 
point improvement on 2020.
Ryanair shares were trading 0.3% higher in London on Thursday at EUR16.04 each, while Wizz Air stock was up 
1.1% at 4,988.00 pence a share.

Decade of
disruption
The 10 years following the terror attacks were challenging, but the period did usher in a new breed of low-cost 
airline and different ways of doing business
In the decade following the terror attacks, the airline business was a sorry story when it came to making money. 
Giovanni Bisignani, the plain-speaking Italian who led the International Air Transport Association for a decade from 
2002, said in his annual report of 2010 that the industry had lost nearly $50 billion in that decade.
Less than two years after the 9/11 attacks, Bisignani told airline bosses at the IATA annual meeting in June 2003: 
“Our industry has been hit by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The successive impact of September 11, a 
world economic slowdown, Iraq and SARS has been devastating. Our industry was like the boxer who gets hit 
harder after every knockdown.”
In the early 2000s, this was described as a crisis – but however shocking those losses were, the word crisis does 
not even come close to describing how bad the past 18 months have been. In 2020, IATA estimates, the industry 
lost $126.4 billion, with a further loss of $47.7 billion expected this year.
Intense restructuring
“9/11 was one of a number of catalysts that drove industry restructuring at the time, but it did not change the 
ultimate direction of the business. And this is exactly what Covid will do – it will speed up an evolutionary process 
that has already been taking place,” believes Mark Dunkerley, who had taken the chief commercial officer role at 
Belgium’s Sabena just weeks before 9/11 and joined Hawaiian Airlines as president in 2002.
The 2000s was a period of intense airline restructuring, particularly in the USA. But there is some irony in the fact 
that government financial support and Chapter 11 bankruptcy processes that many US carriers entered slowed 
change.
No Headline In Original
“The weakest did not fade away. They restructured and came back stronger,” says Dunkerley. “The impact of not 
letting market forces play out is like taking a bandage off slowly; it prolonged the pain.”
There were failures in this decade, of course. Famous names such as Ansett Australia, Air Afrique, Sabena, 
Swissair, Transbrasil, and TWA went away.
However, just as now, there were upstarts and disruptors ready to take advantage. As Flight Inter­national’s sister 
title Airline Business wrote in September 2002: “While others have suffered, the crisis has provided a springboard 
for the new breed of low‑fare operators, with JetBlue as its poster child.” In Europe, Ryanair, Go and EasyJet were 
making waves, with WestJet in Canada and Virgin Blue in Australia growing fast too.
For Jeff Katz, a digital air travel services pioneer, who was chief executive of Swissair from 1997 to 2000 and on the 
board of Northwest Airlines from 2005 to 2009, airline consolidation that was triggered by the financial shock was 
the single biggest impact of 9/11 in the years that followed.
The biggest saw the merger of America West and US Airways in 2005, the joining of Delta Air Lines and Northwest 
in 2008 and the union of Continental and United in 2010.
“Europe did different versions of consolidation, with Air France-KLM, British Airways-Iberia and the formation of the 
Lufthansa Group; but overall, whether in the US or Europe, they have been good for airlines,” says Katz. “In the US, 
you now have four very powerful airlines that dominate networks. Europe is a little softer, but the by-product of 
carefully managing capacity has happened.”
Another major development in the immediate post-9/11 period was the rise of the internet to sell air tickets and 
travel and the acceleration of digital technology, says Katz. In June 2002, he was the chief executive of new global 
online travel business Orbitz Worldwide, set up by the US majors in response to the rise of online travel agencies 
such as Expedia and Travelocity. “Orbitz took off as online access to life became essential rather than a nice to 
have. Its website was much better designed than those of the airlines,” says Katz.
The European carriers founded their own online travel agency, Opodo, which was launched in November 2001 by 
Bisignani before he joined IATA. In this decade the online booking of travel increasingly became the norm. It was 
also a time when IATA brought in electronic ticketing to automate several outdated processes and save money.
Change needed
For Dunkerley, who retired as chief executive of Hawaiian in 2018, one of the lessons of 9/11, and the series of 
shocks that followed during that decade – including SARS, Hurricane Katrina, oil prices spiking to $140 a barrel and 
the global financial crisis of 2008 – was that industry change had not gone far enough. “What was revealing about 
that decade was how the impact of each major shock showed that restructuring wasn’t yet done,” he says. “The 
industry still was not working well. It was still not producing sensible returns in good times or demonstrating 
resilience in bad.”
Following the big US mergers – and with capacity discipline the order of the day, rather than the chase of market 
share – the 2010-2020 decade did usher in a period of unprecedented profitability for the US carriers and for 
airlines globally.
The impact of Covid has undone virtually all that progress. However, the airline industry is a resilient business, 
driven by the strong underlying demand for air travel. The actors delivering that service will change, and – just as 
after 9/11 – there will be consolidation among the strongest, and low-cost carriers will flourish. w

Sep 02, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Delta Air Lines' DAL[1] management announced that it intends to boost its workforce by hiring 
1,500 flight attendants in the summer of 2022 to meet the anticipated increase in air-travel demand. Meanwhile, 
Southwest Airlines' LUV[2] pilots opted for the legal route against the company alleging that the latter brought about 
some changes in their pay and working conditions without negotiations during the pandemic. 
The European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[3] August traffic was impressive as widespread 
vaccination in addition to the relaxation of restrictions in the EU led to an uptick in air travel. Recap of the Past 
Week's Most Important Stories 1. Following the latest announcement to hire flight attendants, Delta, currently 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will have 3,000 flight attendants for the summer of 2022. This is because it had 
recruited 1,500 flight attendants last year before the pandemic struck. The airline requires all new recruits to be fully 
vaccinated before their training starts[4]. 
Delta was also in the news when it announced that its unvaccinated employees will have to pay $200 more per 
month for their company-sponsored healthcare scheme[5]. The surcharge will be effective Nov 1. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. The lawsuit filed by the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association in the federal court in Dallas claims that the airline 
'significantly altered working conditions, rules, and pay rates for pilots' sans negotiations. Per management, 
measures taken by the company to tackle the coronavirus-induced challenges did not require any discussion. The 
pilots' union is seeking an injunction so that the company restores the terms of their collective bargaining 
agreement[7]. 
3. Reflective of the improving air-travel demand scenario in the European Union, Ryanair's August traffic surged 
58.6% year over year to 11.1 million. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the period was 82% 
compared with 73% in August 2020. The airline operated more than 71,000 flights last month. That the August 
traffic report will be impressive was hinted at by its CEO Michael O'Leary as reported in the previous week's 
writeup[8]. 
With travel demand continuing to recover, Ryanair announced 14 new routes from London as part of its winter 2021 
schedule. 
4. United Airlines' UAL[9] Boeing 777 jets, one of which was involved in the emergency landing at the Denver 
International Airport in February, remain grounded as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) continues to review 
Airline Stock Roundup: DAL 's Hiring Plans, LUV in a Legal Wrangle & More
the Boeing 777-200 planes with Pratt &#38; Whitney engines, per a Reuters report[10]. The jet involved in the 
United Airlines' Denver fiasco was powered by a Pratt &#38; Whitney engine. 
The aircraft had to make an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport after one of its right engines 
failed soon after the take-off. The plane was headed to Honolulu. Following this flight scare, United Airlines stopped 
operating the 24 such jets in its fleet post the FAA order that the planes required inspections. According to the 
Reuters report, The Wall Street Journal reported that United Airlines' 777 jets may not fly until early 2022. 
5. In a customer-friendly move, Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK[11], unveiled 
a new lounge at the San Francisco International airport (SFO). The space offers a variety of facilities like espresso 
drinks and a play area for kids. The latest is an addition to the seven lounges, already operated by Alaska Airlines 
across the United States Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that the majority of stocks have traded in the red in the past week, even though the losses 
were muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index was flat at $92.07. Over the course of the past 
six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 14.4%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With air-travel 
demand improving in Latin America, the August traffic report of Gol Linhas GOL[12] will be keenly awaited in the 
coming days.

 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] August 2021 traffic increased 58.6% year over year to 11.1 million owing to continued 
recovery in air-travel demand in the European Union. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the 
period was 82% compared with 73% in August 2020. The airline operated more than 71,000 flights last month. 
The traffic figures not only represent significant improvement from the year-ago numbers, but also on a sequential 
basis. The European low-cost carrier's August passenger numbers climbed 19.4% from the July level. August load 
factor also ascended 2 percentage points from July. 
Traffic, however, continues to be below the pre-pandemic levels. Evidently, Ryanair's August traffic declined 25.5% 
from 
the 
August 
2019 
level.

Ryanair ends Max 10 talks

Ryanair has said that talks with Boeing on a potential Boeing 737 Max 10 order have fallen through due to diverging 
views on pricing.
"We are disappointed we couldn't reach agreement with Boeing on a Max 10 order," O'Leary said in a statement.
"However, Boeing have a more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track 
record of not paying high prices for aircraft," O'Leary added.
The European low-cost carrier recently indicated that it was unlikely a deal could be reached before next year.
"We still can't reach an agreement on price. I would say there's a meaningful gap between us and Boeing on price," 
Michael O'Leary said during a media briefing last week, adding that the company was "hopeful" a deal could be 
reached in 2022.
He also underlined the price range it is considering for the kind of bulk order Ryanair is used to making, stating that 
"if they're looking for $100 million per plane, I won't take any".
Boeing's extended range narrowbody is valued at around $134 million at list prices.
O'Leary continued: "We do not share Boeing's optimistic pricing outlook, although this may explain why in recent 
weeks other large Boeing customers such as Delta and Jet2, have been placing new orders with Airbus, rather than 
Boeing."
Ryanair is Boeing's largest 737 Max customer outside the USA with 210 197-seat Boeing 737 Max 8200s on order, 
12 of which were delivered this summer.
"We have a more than sufficient order pipeline to allow us to grow strongly over the next five years with a Boeing 
737 fleet, which will rise to over 600 aircraft and will enable Ryanair to capitalise on the extraordinary growth 
opportunities that are emerging all over Europe as the continent recovers from the Covid pandemic," O'Leary 
added.
There are currently 559 737 Max 10s on order, according to Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker, including a recent 
top-up order for 150 units by United Airlines.

Pressure remains on Boeing 's extended narrowbody

So far this year, Boeing has outpaced Airbus in new-generation narrowbody orders as confidence in the aircraft 
returns and several key markets approach clearance for a return of Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
The US manufacturer had received 175 net orders for the Max compared with 106 for the Airbus A320neo family as 
of 31 August.
Airbus managed to close the gap significantly in August with 95 net orders for the A320neo. Up to the end of July, 
Boeing had received 168 net orders for the Max, compared with just 11 for the A320neo family.
However, with the Max grounded for nearly two years, the programme still lags far behind the A320neo.
Airbus's A320neo-family backlog stands at 5,654 aircraft, compared with 3,325 for the Max after ASC 606 
adjustments.
The difference is wider when comparing larger-gauge narrowbodies. Airbus still holds a roughly six-to-one lead over 
Boeing in the segment, with 2,990 A321neos in its backlog.
This compares with 561 737 Max 10 units for Boeing, according to Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker, including the 
recent top-up order for 150 units by United Airlines this year.
The A321neo has also received more support from the leasing community. Fleet Tracker shows around 18% of 
A321neo aircraft in its backlog were ordered by lessors, compared with around 10% for the Max 10.
The A321neo programme is already in service, with 580 deliveries as of 31 July, while the Max 10 is slated to enter 
commercial service in 2023.
This is around the same time that Airbus is expected to start deliveries of the A321XLR, its 4,700nm range 
narrowbody, whereas Boeing is still assessing its 'New Midsize Airplane', its own long-haul narrowbody product.
Further impacting the programme, Ryanair, Boeing's largest 737 Max customer outside the USA, recently scrapped 
a potential 737 Max 10 order due to diverging views on pricing of the aircraft.
Pressure remains on Boeing 's extended narrowbody
"Boeing have a more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track record of not 
paying high prices for aircraft," Ryanair's chief executive officer, Michael O'Leary, said.
He added: "We do not share Boeing's optimistic pricing outlook, although this may explain why in recent weeks 
other large Boeing customers such as Delta and Jet2, have been placing new orders with Airbus, rather than 
Boeing."
Delta Air Lines and Jet2 together ordered 66 A321neos from Airbus in August.
During a media briefing late that month, O'Leary said that if Boeing was seeking "$100 million per plane, I won't 
take any".
Boeing's extended-range narrowbody is worth roughly $130 million at list prices.

Suvarnabhumi-based express cargo airline K-Mile Asia has confirmed the launch of operations with its first Boeing 
737-800 converted freighter.
The aircraft was delivered following conversion by Boeing at STAECO in Jinan, China, and is now flying for K-Mile 
customer DHL Aviation serving Hanoi and Hong Kong from Bangkok.
The 2006-vintage aircraft was previously operated as a passenger aircraft by Irish low-cost airline Ryanair.
Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker lists the aircraft as belonging to leasing platform KV Aviation.
The aircraft is the 50th 737-800 converted by Boeing for freighter use.
K-Mile Asia's first 737-800BCF is the fourth aircraft in its fleet, joining three 737-400F units.
K-Mile Asia's cargo 737s serve an extensive network across Southeast Asia for DHL, connecting Bangkok 
Suvarnabhumi with destinations including Phnom Penh, Singapore, Jakarta, Yangon and Vientiane.
Welcoming the new aircraft to the fleet, K-Mile chief operating officer Pansith Sasunee, said "It is a very important 
step forward as we pursue our growth plans for the airline, and it is a positive statement of the confidence of our 
shareholders in the future of K-Mile as a leading express parcel cargo operator in Thailand and across Southeast 
Asia."
Sasunee joined K-Mile in January 2021; before that he was the head of planning and fleet management at Thai low-
cost carrier Nok Air.

Following a failed takeover bid of Easyjet, reports have emerged Wizz Air is in talks with Airbus to order another 
100 new generation narrowbody aircraft.
Negotiations between Wizz Air and the European manufacturer have progressed over summer 2021 but the two 
companies are not currently in a position to confirm a deal, Reuters writes.
Wizz Air declined to comment.
The Hungarian carrier has 236 A320neo family aircraft still on order with Airbus, according to the August data from 
the OEM, including an order for 20 A321XLRs with deliveries starting in 2023.
It ended the three months to 30 June 2021 with 141 aircraft after adding six A321neos, while returning two A320 
aircraft, on lease expiry, to lessors.
CDB Aviation signed a purchase and leaseback agreement with Wizz Air covering four new Airbus A321neos 
earlier this month. The carrier also closed a 12-year financing of one A321neo delivery with Credit Agricole-CIB via  
Japanese operating lease (JOL).
Airbus' A320neo-family backlog stood at 5,654 aircraft as of 31 August.
European low-cost airline group Ryanair recently ended talks over a large Boeing 737 Max 10 aircraft order, 
suggesting it is willing to wait until the next economic downturn to reach a better deal on aircraft pricing.

Avolon cancels widebody orders

Lessor Avolon cancelled orders for two 787-9 aircraft in August, leaving a single 787, also a -9 variant, in its Boeing 
backlog alongside 31 additional 737 Max units, manufacturer data shows.
Nonetheless, Chicago-headquartered Boeing reported its seventh straight month of positive net orders.
Boeing recorded 53 new orders in August, but also 30 cancellations.
The new purchase commitments signed during the month comprised deals for 35 Boeing 737 Max programme 
aircraft, seven 787-9 widebody aircraft and 11 777Fs.
The 737 Max orders included eight additional units for US-based 777 Partners, the first direct manufacturer order 
placed by Griffin Global Asset Management, for five Max units, 12 from Alaska Airlines and eight from United 
Airlines. Two unidentified customers ordered the two remaining Max units.
The widebody orders placed in August comprised 10 777Fs for an undisclosed buyer, an additional 777F for FedEx 
and seven 787-9s, also from an undisclosed customer.
On the cancellation front, unidentified customers terminated orders for 20 Max aircraft, while United cancelled 
contracts for eight Max units but reinstated them under newly inked purchase orders the same month.
Aircraft leasing companies were involved in certain 737 Max deliveries last month.
Boeing handed over 22 aircraft in August, down from 28 deliveries in July, including 14 737 Max aircraft.
Air Lease (ALC) and Jackson Square Aviation each took two 737 Max units, respectively. The bulk of the Max 
deliveries in August went to United, which accepted seven units. Ryanair and Turkish Airlines both took a single 
Max last month.
Once again, there were no 787 widebody deliveries in August as Boeing continued to address programme 
deficiencies highlighted in recent months.
Boeing handed over 767F and 777F widebody freighters to FedEx and DHL last month.
Avolon cancels widebody orders
The OEM has landed total new orders for 683 aircraft in the first eight months, to 31 August, offset by 403 
cancellations.

Fresh routes launched by Ryanair amid 'very strong' recovery Airlines
Fresh routes launched by Ryanair amid 'very strong' recovery; Airlines

Ryanair expects to return to pre-pandemic passenger numbers this winter, as Europe's largest airline banks on a 
"very strong recovery" in travel.
The carrier has launched 14 new routes from London for this winter and will slash prices of its flights to encourage 
passengers to step back on board.
"The recovery has been very strong," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive. He claimed that "no airline has 
recovered as quickly as we have", after estimating that Ryanair carried a little more than 10.5m customers in 
August.
He expected the airline to sustain those numbers in September and October, with the launch of new routes from 
Stansted and Luton to places including Grenoble, Turin, Naples and Helsinki, which will help to create 500 new 
jobs.
Between November and March, O'Leary expected Ryanair to hit prepandemic passenger levels on a monthly basis. 
Monthly numbers are running at 85 per cent of pre-Covid levels. The airline is then expected to exceed its annual 
pre-pandemic level of about 150m travellers in the year to March 2023.
Ryanair plans aggressive expansion: it will receive 55 Boeing 737 Max aircraft this winter and the same number 
each year until 2025. Its fleet will expand to 600 by the end of the 2026 financial year, up from more than 450.
Fresh routes launched by Ryanair amid 'very strong' recovery Airlines
Jet2, another UK low-cost carrier, also showed increasing confidence in the recovery in air travel as it unveiled a 
deal to buy dozens of Airbus A321 NEO aircraft to meet expected growth and to refresh its fleet.
The order is for 36 planes worth $4.9bn - although the Leeds-based group said it negotiated significant discounts - 
that will be delivered between 2023 and 2028. Jet2 has the option to extend the deal to 60 aircraft.
O'Leary said it would take until the summer of next year for prices to return to normal levels. "There's a lot of pent-
up demand there. The pent-up demand will take advantage of low pricing, pricing will then begin to work its way 
back up to pre-pandemic levels."
He said the traffic light system for travel was holding back people from going abroad due to uncertainty. "The UK is 
lagging behind. The traffic light system serves no purpose any more."
The airline has emerged from the pandemic in a relatively robust position because of its lower cost base as well as 
the collapse or problems of rivals such as Thomas Cook and TAP Air Portugal.
O'Leary estimated that Europe would have 20 per cent less short-haul capacity as a result of the pandemic. Ryanair 
was not encountering staffing problems for pilots and cabin crew.
In response to reports that British Airways was considering replacing shorthaul operations with low-cost ones at 
Gatwick, O'Leary said it was "the very definition of insanity", and "no legacy airline has ever managed" to succeed 
in producing a successful low-cost airline.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that the British Airways' plan to set up a budget 
airline would fail "like all the ones before it" as it has no commitment to low fares, The Telegraph reported Tuesday.
O'Leary said the move by the International Consolidated Airlines (IAG.L) unit is the "definition of insanity."
Ryanair's shares fell over 3%, while IAG slipped almost 3% on Tuesday's close.

Boeing has shrugged off concerns over Ryanair's recent decision to end negotiations for a large Boeing 737 Max 
10 order.
Instead, Boeing's senior-vice president commercial marketing Darren Hulst highlighted the historical success of 
major low-cost carriers operating the 737 will continue in the future.
"Globally the two most important and successful low-cost carriers in history have been Southwest Airlines and 
Ryanair, and we have managed to support both of the airlines with 737s over the last 40 to 50 years, especially in 
recent decades for Ryanair," Hulst said during a media briefing.
"The 737 Max 8 and high capacity 737 Max 8200 that Ryanair has ordered is truly going to be a changer... we look 
forward to that taking flight as their fleet grows and builds scale."
Hulst added the US manufacturer will continue to ensure the 737 Max 10 and other derivatives of the Max 
programme can help Ryanair "change the game even more".
Ryanair has ordered a total 210 737 Max 8200s with 12 delivered over the summer.

Ryanair is willing to wait until the next aviation downturn in order to secure better pricing from Boeing for an 
additional aircraft order, the airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has told Reuters.
As reported, this week the Irish low-cost carrier ended talks about a potential order for up to an additional 250 
Boeing 737 Max 10 aircraft, saying that Boeing was being too optimistic about pricing.
"We take the view we are still in a period of great crisis. Boeing take the view that now the world is fine and it's all 
recovered and its latest pricing offer reflects that," O'Leary told Reuters.
He added that the low-cost carrier would delay an order "for a period of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 years until we get to the next 
crisis", or until Boeing otherwise changed its views on pricing.
Ryanair is Boeing's largest 737 Max customer outside the USA with 210 197-seat Boeing 737 Max 8200s on order, 
12 of which were delivered this summer.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA)  has raised its estimate for the number of passengers it expects to fly over the 
rest of the year after a "very strong recovery" recently in short-haul demand.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the airline expects to fly 10.5mln passengers a month in September, October 
and November, against his previous estimate of 10mln.
"As long as there are no adverse COVID developments, things are set fair for a very strong recovery," O'Leary told 
Reuters ahead of a briefing in Brussels.
Flights should return to pre-covid -19 levels in October, he added, from close to 90% in September and 80% in 
August.
Though the airline will likely fly with 15-20% empty seats this winter compared with 7-8% before the pandemic.
"Through the winter, pricing will continue to build, but it will still be below (pre-)COVID," he said. "We don't expect 
pricing to go back to pre-COVID levels until the summer of 2022."
Ryanair also announced it was launching 14 new routes from UK to places in Spain, Italy, France, Finland and 
Sweden.
O'Leary also reiterates his support for Boeing and said it was looking at a new order for Max-10 planes, but only 
when the timing was right.
Other airlines echoed Ryanair's comments about the recovery in flying.

EasyJet has announced it will fly to more destinations, while British Airways is mulling a new short-haul operation 
based at Gatwick.
Ryanair shares eased 3.3% to (EURO)15.81, easyJet PLC dropped 1.8% to 794p while British Airways owner IAG 
shed 3.6% 157.6p.
Talk of a new Covid variant C.1.2, emanating from South Africa seemed to be the cause even though the World

Lithuania pushes for EU ban on Belavia leases
Lithuania pushes for EU ban on Belavia leases

The Government of Lithuania is lobbying in the European Union to ban bloc-based lessors from dealing with 
Belavia (B2, Minsk National) due to the Belarus carrier's alleged involvement in a state-sponsored people-
smuggling racket, Politico has reported.
"We need to make sure that no European company participates, either directly or indirectly, in the human smuggling 
- as, for example, those European companies that are renting airplanes to the otherwise sanctioned Belarusian 
Belavia company," Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis wrote to the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell.
Later, the governments of all three EU countries bordering Belarus - Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland - joined by 
Estonia, issued a statement calling for their fellow EU member states to "jointly use all available diplomatic and 
practical means to cut the new irregular migration routes at its inception". However, they did not specifically ask for 
pressure to be put on lessors dealing with Belavia.
Belarus's EU neighbours have accused President Alexander Lukashenko's regime of at least facilitating, if not 
outright organising, a new migration route from the Middle East via Belarus to the EU. In July and August 2021, the 
issue came to light when thousands of economic migrants and refugees mostly from Iraq, tried to enter Lithuania, 
having first flown to Minsk National on Iraqi Airways or Fly Baghdad flights. Both carriers increased their capacity to 
Belarus at that time. While these flights largely stopped after the EU put pressure on Baghdad, Belavia has 
allegedly been using its scheduled services to Turkey to carry not just Belarusian vacation-goers, but also migrants 
subsequently escorted by Belarus authorities to EU borders.
State-owned Belavia is heavily exposed to international lessors. According to the ch-aviation fleets ownership 
module, it owns just 12 of 33 aircraft in its current fleet, including three VIP aircraft operated on behalf of the 
government. Out of its commercial fleet, 21 out of 30 aircraft are currently dry-leased, primarily from EU-based 
lessors. It leases six aircraft (one B737-300, two B737-500, and three E195-E2s) from Ireland-based AerCap, four 
E175s and three E195s from Denmark's Nordic Aviation Capital, one B737-800 each from Ireland's SMBC Aviation 
Capital and Thunderbolt Aircraft Lease, and one B737-300 from Romanian carrier Carpatair. The remainder of 
Belavia's fleet is leased from US-based entities Air Lease Corporation, Altavair, and Merx Aviation Finance.
Sources told Politico that lessors have been unwilling to heed any non-binding pressure from the EU and that any 
binding decisions are doubtful. While Belavia and all other Belarus-based carriers are banned from the European 
Lithuania pushes for EU ban on Belavia leases
Union airspace after the state-backed hijacking of a Ryanair B737-800 in Belarus, no trade or financial sanctions 
have been placed on the airline.
None of the involved EU-based lessors responded to ch-aviation's request for comment, except for NAC, which 
refused to comment.

(Alliance News) - Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair returned to profit in July thanks to a strong holiday season, but 
expects a "difficult" winter, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told AFP on Tuesday.
"We went back to profit in July, we'll make a profit again in August because the recovery has been very strong in 
the peak summer period. But this winter will be difficult," O'Leary said after holding a major press conference in 
London.
Shares in the Dublin-based airline were down 3.1% to EUR15.84 in London on Tuesday afternoon. 
Earlier, O'Leary told Reuters that Ryanair has lifted its passenger target for September, October and November to 
10.5 million per month. The previous forecast in July was for 10 million passengers per month in that period. 
O'Leary said Ryanair is set to beat its target for 10.5 million passengers in August, and that capacity should return 
to pre-pandemic levels in October - up from 90% in September and 80% in August.
But around 15% to 20% of seats will be empty over the winter, compared to 7% to 8% before the pandemic, he 
added. Pricing will "continue to build" over the winter and is expected to reach pre-Covid levels in summer 2022.

Ryanair accuses TAP of blocking Lisbon slots

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) continues its campaign against state protection of TAP Air Portugal (TP, Lisbon) with 
group chief executive Michael O'Leary accusing the flag carrier of deliberately blocking slots at Lisbon airport to 
prevent the growth of competitors.
Announcing its winter schedule from Portugal, Ryanair in a statement hit out at TAP saying: "TAP confirmed that its 
fleet will suffer a 20% cut (from 108 to 88 aircraft) this summer, yet it continues to block the growth of competition at 
Portela airport. The airline, which currently operates 50% of its capacity, only unlocks slots on a weekly basis to 
prevent other airlines from using them to grow.
"We appeal to the Portuguese Government and the slot coordinator in Lisbon to prevent TAP from accumulating 
take-off and landing slots that it does not have the capacity to use, as TAP has already confirmed the reduction of 
its fleet by 20 %. TAP should not be authorised to pretend that it can use weekly slots throughout the season, but 
then return them to the regulator on a weekly basis just to prevent competitors from using them."
TAP was not immediately available for comment.
Speaking at a news conference in Lisbon, O'Leary said Ryanair would invest more in Portugal if these slots were 
released, which would help tourism recover faster. "We could put more planes in Lisbon, create more jobs, help 
Portugal grow and recover from the COVID-19 crisis faster," he added. While he acknowledged that TAP was doing 
nothing illegal, he said the carrier was currently" blocking around 300 flights".
Ryanair has been in a running battle against Brussels' sanctioned state aid to TAP. Earlier this month it filed 
another complaint in the European General Court against EUR462 million euros (USD540 million) in Portuguese 
state-aid to TAP.
This is Ryanair's second legal challenge against European Commission approved state funding to the Portuguese 
national carrier after it successfully contested a bailout of EUR1.2 billion (USD1.4 billion) granted on June 10, 2020. 
However, the EC has since re-approved the rescue aid. The Portuguese state regained a 72.5% controlling share in 
TAP in exchange for the funding.
Ryanair accuses TAP of blocking Lisbon slots
Meanwhile, Ryanair said it would continue to invest in Portugal. It announced a winter 2021 schedule to/from 
Portugal with 124 destinations, including 26 new routes from Lisbon, Porto, and Faro to destinations such as Bari 
and Palermo (Italy), Agadir (Morocco), Lanzarote (Spain), and Malta Int'l (Malta), amongst others.
From November, the airline will also base three additional aircraft in Lisbon, bringing its total fleet there to seven for 
the 2021 winter schedule.

EU court to hear Ryanair action on aid to Aegean Airlines
EU court to hear Ryanair action on aid to Aegean Airlines

The Court of Justice of the European Union's Luxembourg-based General Court has said it will hear a review, 
initiated by Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), of the European Commission's approval of state aid to Aegean Airlines (A3, 
Athens Int'l).
In Ryanair's latest legal challenge to bailouts handed to European carriers since the outbreak of Covid-19, the 
General Court agreed to assess the Irish low-cost carrier's "action for annulment" against the European competition 
regulator's decision to back the Greek government's aid package.
In December, the commission backed a Greek state grant of EUR120 million euros (USD142 million) to the 
privately-owned flag carrier, judging it to be in line with the bloc's loosened Covid-era state aid rules. The sum "does 
not exceed the estimated damage caused to the airline between March 23 and June 30" of last year, it said in its 
statement at the time.
The aid was conditional on Aegean Airlines undertaking a share capital increase of EUR60 million (USD71 million), 
which it announced it completed in June.
However, the court summarised in its recent resolution to hear the case that "the applicant, Ireland-based Ryanair 
DAC, is challenging several state aid measures for the airline sector throughout the EU that were granted during the 
Covid-19 pandemic. In support of its action, it contends that the European Commission [...] committed a manifest 
error of assessment in its review of the proportionality of the aid to the damage caused by the Covid-19 crisis" and 
"violated several principles of EU law."
Ryanair has sought to undo bailouts handed to Air France, Finnair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS 
Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, LOT Polish Airlines, and other major EU airlines, mostly without success. It 
has argued that the European regulator's approvals of state aid have gone "against the fundamental principles of 
EU law and reversed the clock on the process of liberalisation in air transport by rewarding inefficiency and 
encouraging unfair competition."
Aegean Airlines was not immediately available for comment.

British Airways is poised to launch a new low-cost airline for Europe, a move that would allow it to compete with the 
two premier budget carriers that service the continent.
EasyJet and Ryanair have had success in recovering from the pandemic as both mostly cater to leisure travelers, 
the group that has returned more quickly than the business sector travelers, CNN noted.
British Airways CEO Sean Doyle issued a memo to BA staff, first seen by the travel website Headforpoints.com, 
Doyle said that British Airways was planning a "new operating subsidiary" to run alongside its existing long-haul 
operation at London's Gatwick airport.
Doyle added that the new airline would seek to serve "highly competitive" short-haul routes from London's second-
biggest airport by the summer of 2022.
A spokesperson for British Airways confirmed to CNN that the airline was working "on proposals for a short-haul 
operation at Gatwick" but declined to comment further.
British Airways' owner, International Airways Group (IAG), has been no different than any other major airline - it 
hemorrhaged money for the last year-and-a-half due to the coronavirus pandemic, a reluctance to travel by air, and 
restrictions on those who were willing to fly by air.
IAG reported a pre-tax loss of 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for the first half of this year, the bulk of which was 
incurred by British Airways.

seeks flexibility from unions ahead of return to Gatwick for short-haul flights

When British Airways moved its shorthaul flights from Gatwick to Heathrow last year to survive the pandemic 
downturn, some wondered if the UK's flag carrier would ever return in full force.
The country's second airport, home base of low-cost rival easyJet, had always been a tougher challenge than 
Heathrow, its main hub of operations and the link to its once lucrative transatlantic routes.
"It was always seen as a difficult business because of [BA's] cost structure," said Chris Tarry, aviation consultant at 
Ctaira consultancy.
Over the past decade, easyJet's share of flights from Gatwick increased 25 per cent, while BA's declined by a third, 
according to Tarry.
Now BA is aiming to return to shorthaul flying from Gatwick and, according to two people close to the subject, has 
been in negotiations with unions for several months over more flexible terms and conditions to support a new, lower 
cost airline operating from the airport.
However, lower cost does not mean low cost. People with knowledge of the situation said that the group was 
looking at setting up services "in line with BA brand guidelines".

This suggested that the airline would not try to replicate the offers and models operated by Ryanair, easyJet and 
Wizz Air, but focus instead on leveraging advantages such as brand, reliability, flight times and loyalty, said 
analysts.
Sean Doyle, BA chief executive, suggested in late July that the group would have to find a lower-cost model if it was 
to operate a sustainable business out of the airport best known for its leisure traffic.
"We're looking at what [the] options are for summer '22 at Gatwick," he told analysts and investors at the results 
meeting of parent group IAG late last month. "We need to be competitive because the market will be very 
competitive coming out at the other end of the pandemic."
Doyle was referring not just to the inevitable price competition that will intensify as airlines seek to woo passengers 
on to their aircraft, but to the stated ambitions of the most aggressive low cost carriers to snatch market share as 
demand comes back.
Ryanair has some 200 737 max singleaisle aircraft on order and chief executive Michael O'Leary has been 
bellicose about his plans to grow quickly while competitors are still recovering from the financial damage wrought by 
the pandemic. Wizz Air, the Hungarian upstart, has declared its own ambition to take 20 per cent of the take-off and 
landing slots at Gatwick. BA has 18 per cent of the slots, while before the pandemic easyJet had about 45 per cent.
BA had a choice, said Stephen Furlong, aviation analyst at Davy, the Irish stockbroker and asset manager. "The 
choice is to cede and go back to Heathrow, or to hold their ground, keep their slots and compete," he said.
But competing with low-cost operators is notoriously difficult for legacy carriers. BA has twice tried and failed to run 
a low-cost operation of its own.
"Low-cost carriers drive down overheads by sweating assets more efficiently," said Martin Chalk, acting general 
secretary of the pilots' union Balpa.
"Aircraft don't go there and back, they tramp around Europe. Network airlines don't have that ability because their 
routes are designed as an integrated network product ... marrying up waves of European flights with waves of 
Atlantic flights. Network airlines will always struggle to compete on price against the low-cost carriers for that 
reason."
Chalk, who is not involved in the discussions with BA, said the union welcomed the prospect of a new airline that 
could re-employ the pilots who have been grounded by the pandemic. It may mean different terms and conditions, 
but increased flexibility was already a feature of labour agreements at several airlines, he said.
At easyJet, for example, some pilots work full time in peak summer periods and 50 per cent in the slower winter 
months.
People with knowledge of the discussions said this kind of flexibility was among the topics being discussed by BA 
and unions. It is expected there will also be a shift in balance from fixed pay to remuneration based on the hours 
flown.
In the end, returning to Gatwick - where customers mainly expect to fly directly to their destination rather than 
connect to another flight - would pitch BA head to head with easyJet, and potentially in future with Wizz. Relying on 
brand, reliability and loyalty would not be sufficient, said Furlong.
"The only way they can compete is to have some version of labour agreement and flexibility that their competitor set 
has," he said. "Most short-haul flights at Gatwick are point to point ... and those more traditional BA competitor sets 
are not sufficient. You have to be competitive on the cost side."

British Airways mulls short-haul shift to new airline based at Gatwick
British Airways mulls short-haul shift to new airline based at Gatwick

British Airways, part of airline conglomerate International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG), is considering 
shifting all its short-haul operations into a new low-cost subsidiary based at Gatwick Airport, according to reports 
today.
The airline suspended flights from the airport at the start of the pandemic to use vacant slots at Heathrow but with 
flights starting to edge back towards pre-pandemic levels, the airline is said to be keen to re-establish its presence 
in the shorter flight end of the market.
British Airways has traditionally earned much of its revenue from long-haul especially the US to UK routes and has 
been hit hard by Covid as these flights have almost all been halted by the pandemic.
A subsidiary would allow it to lower its cost base and compete more effectively with dominant European discount 
carriers such as Ryanair PLC, EasyJet PLC and WizzAir PLC.
A British Airways spokesman told the Wall Street Journal any progress on the new subsidiary will require 
agreement being reached with the group's unions.
Earlier today, Gatwick, which is owned by French industrial group Vinci, said it was considering a way to boost 
capacity at the airport by converting its emergency runaway into a second landing and take-off strip.
The conversion would cost £500mln and see the existing northern runway moved 12m sideways and upgraded.

Previous attempts by Gatwick to add a second runway have into fierce local opposition and  Communities Against 
Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE) again condemned the plan.
The expansion "flies in the face of the climate emergency we are all facing" and would one million tonnes of 
additional carbon on top of Gatwick's pre-Covid-19 flight figures said the group.
Shares in IAG fell 1% to 161.7p.

Ryanair pulls out of Northern Ireland over tax issues
Ryanair pulls out of Northern Ireland over tax issues

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has blamed UK passenger taxes and a lack of COVID-19 recovery incentives for its 
decision to pull out of Northern Ireland this year.
The Irish carrier in a statement on August 24 confirmed it would stop flying from both Belfast City and Belfast Int'l on 
September 13 and October 30 respectively, while it already ended operations from Londonderry earlier this year. A 
Ryanair spokesperson said the airline would reallocate its aircraft to lower-cost airports elsewhere in the UK and 
Europe for the winter schedule starting in November.
The UK government levies GBP13 pounds (about USD18) on each departing passenger on short-haul flights of 
3,200km and GBP82 (USD112) for longer return flights, with higher rates for premium class travellers. It increased 
the longer-haul charge this year in the face of criticism from the aviation industry.
Airlines operating in Northern Ireland are subject to these charges, in contrast to the Republic of Ireland, which 
axed passenger tax in 2013. Derry City Airport joined forces with the two Belfast gateways in 2018 to demand that 
the UK government follow the Irish example. Ryanair and other carriers with UK-based operations also have been 
lobbying for a cut or end to the APD.
Ryanair's departure from Belfast City means the loss of eight routes: Alicante, Malaga, Palma de 
Mallorca, Ibiza, Barcelona El Prat, and Valencia Manises in Spain, Faro in Portugal, and Milan Bergamo in Italy, 
according to the ch-aviation schedules module. Belfast International will lose six routes including Alicante and 
Malaga in Spain, Gdansk, Kraków, and Warsaw Modlin in Poland, and Milano Bergamo in Italy.
A spokeswoman for Belfast City said the routes had only been seasonal, reported The Irish Times.
Belfast International Airport said: "It is disappointing that Ryanair has now decided to withdraw operations from the 
entire Northern Ireland market at the end of October, having variously had a presence in all three local airports in 
recent years. It has been a difficult period for aviation and a time when consumers need some stability and faith in 
the Northern Ireland air transport network."
The spokesman said the move was not unexpected. "As we have been anticipating such a move, we have been 
engaging with our existing and other new airlines to provide continuity on the routes to be vacated by Ryanair, and 
Ryanair pulls out of Northern Ireland over tax issues
to help sustain employment in the aviation industry at a local level in Northern Ireland. To this end, we hope to be 
able to make announcements regarding fresh route development in the near future."

 International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.L) unit British Airways is looking to set up a budget airline to rival 
EasyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR), The Telegraph reported Thursday.
The new unit will be set up at the Gatwick airport in England and offer short-haul services, but the move may initiate 
a dispute between the airline and the unions if the workers are offered inadequate contracts, the report said.
IAG's shares declined over 1% on Thursday's close.

European budget carriers refute Italian regulator's claims

Budget carriers Ryanair, Wizz Air, Volotea, and easyJet have hit back at the Italian civil aviation authority (Ente 
Nazionale per l'Aviazione Civile - ENAC) for imposing fines of up to EUR50,000 euros (USD58,600) for alleged 
non-compliance with regulations compelling free seat allocation to minors and the disabled next to their carers.
The carriers have refuted as incorrect claims by ENAC last week that they were in default of the new regulations. 
They face penalties ranging from EUR10,000 (USD11,700) to a maximum of EUR50,000 for each individual 
dispute.
ENAC claimed the airlines had not yet, as prescribed and confirmed by an Italian court, changed their computer and 
operating systems and continued to request a supplement equal to the cost of an air ticket for the allocation of seats 
close to carers of minors and the disabled.
This was in addition to alleged violations found at Ryanair, which the ENAC said it would continue to investigate in 
the coming weeks. The ENAC earlier last week imposed a EUR35,000 (USD40,900) fine on the Irish carrier for 
"circumventing" regulations and continuing to charge supplements for the assignment of nearby seats. "The carrier 
has only modified a contractual provision, difficult to perceive by the passenger, which allows them not to pay or to 
obtain reimbursement of the increase in the price paid on the ticket, only after the outcome of a complex procedure, 
evidently elusive of the ENAC regulation and contrary to the provisions of the Regional Administrative Court," the 
regulator said.
ENAC cancelled the seat surcharges by August 15, after the Italian court rejected a request by Ryanair in early 
August to freeze a regulation on the matter until a court hearing on September 8.
"Wizz Air has taken note of ENAC's decision alleging Wizz Air's non-compliance with the newly introduced 
regulation on the seating of minors. We are happy to confirm that our seating systems are set up to ensure that 
parents are seated together with their children at no extra charge. We are in the process of analysing the exact 
substance of ENAC's concerns, as we have always stated this explicitly in the 'Important Notice' section of the Wizz 
Air booking flow," a spokesperson told ch-aviation.
"easyJet believes it has acted in full compliance with the regulations in force and so any initiation of a procedure to 
impose any penalty is totally unfounded. easyJet assigns seats for families together which means that children 
European budget carriers refute Italian regulator's claims
under 12 and persons with reduced mobility are seated next to an accompanying adult at no additional cost," an 
easyJet spokesperson informed ch-aviation.
Volotea said it had examined the investigations initiated by ENAC and found its conclusion to be unfounded. 
"Volotea expects children to always sit next to one of the adults travelling with them. Furthermore, following the 
health uncertainty arising from the pandemic, to ensure the highest level of safety for all passengers and crews, 
Volotea ensures that passengers belonging to the same family sit close together, reducing the risk of contagion 
even more. In the event of the presence of passengers with disabilities, Volotea automatically guarantees the best 
available seat, next to the companion travelling with them. In both cases, the assignment of these places is 
completely free. The company, therefore, does not share the objections raised by ENAC and also remains at the 
disposal of the authority, in order to provide all the information necessary to clarify the conduct being audited," 
Volotea said in a statement.
Ryanair said ENAC's claims were "incorrect" and "misleading". "Ryanair implemented temporary measures on 
August 13 to ensure adult passengers accompanying minors or special needs passengers have several options to 
avail (themselves) of free allocated seating," a spokeswoman said in an emailed comment to Reuters. She said this 
was a temporary solution "as it was impossible to fully amend the booking system in the unreasonable timeframe 
set by ENAC". She added: "It is misleading for ENAC to categorise its interference with the airline's commercial 
freedom to set prices as a safety issue."

Covid-19 Delta variant shocks world airlines

The delta variant of covid-19 is scything through aviation just as key markets were getting back on their feet.
In the U.S., Southwest Airlines is blaming the delta strain for a rash of canceled bookings and a slowdown in 
demand that may push it and several others to quarterly losses. After leading the industry's recovery for much of 
last year, China is in retreat with airlines offering the fewest seats in six months as authorities attempt to stamp out 
an outbreak. Australia's carriers are also in reverse with more than half of the country in lockdown.
"There is every chance the delta variant will dampen any recovery," said John Grant, chief analyst with Official 
Aviation Guide of the Airways. If there is progress, it will be "stop-start" as outbreaks make governments nervous 
about opening borders, he said.
A rare bright spot is Europe, the only place where so-called vaccine passports are widely used. The continent was 
an aviation laggard for most of 2020 as it floundered under infection waves, but airlines such as Ryanair Holdings 
Plc are now capitalizing on high inoculation rates and providing more flights.
Here's how the highly-contagious delta variant has affected major markets:
U.S.
Hopes are fading that a summer recovery, where passenger traffic reached 80% of pre-pandemic levels, will extend 
into the fall as a surge in infections spooks travelers and investors. The Bloomberg Americas Airlines Index last 
week tumbled 5.6% to its lowest level since February.
Southwest warned on Aug. 11 of a slowdown in bookings and rising cancellations, and said it will be difficult to 
replicate July's profit over this quarter. Low-cost airlines Frontier Group Holdings Inc. and Spirit Airlines Inc. have 
also said they may report losses for the three months through September.
The delta variant is putting the brakes on corporate demand, too. Office reopening delays of up to 90 days are 
causing "a bit of a pause" in the recovery of domestic business travel, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed 
Bastian said in an interview with Fox Television on Aug. 9. The carrier is close to 50% of its 2019 level for U.S. 
business travelers.
China
Covid-19 Delta variant shocks world airlines
Chinese airlines plan to operate 360,509 flights in August, the fewest since February, according to data from 
Cirium, which tracks air traffic. That follows the country's latest covid eradication campaign, which included traffic 
shutdowns at airports in places such as Nanjing, Beijing and Yangzhou. On Monday, China reported zero local 
transmissions, a promising sign that its slump in travel will be short-lived.
In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday, Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau said covid 
must be kept at bay before borders can fully reopen. The tight controls are piling pressure on the city's Cathay 
Pacific Airways Ltd., which has suffered without a domestic market.
"It is extremely difficult to plan and operate with the constantly changing environment," Cathay Chairman Patrick 
Healy said on Aug. 11, when the carrier reported a $976 million first-half loss.
Europe
Freer borders and looser quarantine requirements are helping fill planes in Europe during the peak summer season, 
when carriers bring in revenue to see them through the winter months. Regional airline capacity is now about two-
thirds of 2019 levels, compared with roughly a third as recently as April.
Discount airline Ryanair expects to post a profit this quarter and is opening 250 new routes for winter to keep the 
momentum going. Rival Wizz Air Holdings Plc sees capacity returning to pre-covid levels this month, a feat few 
carriers anywhere have achieved.
Deutsche Lufthansa said in early August that North American routes could open up from late summer, with Asia 
next from the end of 2021. Air France-KLM has predicted a return to profit this quarter, when capacity will reach as 
much as 70% of normal levels.
Australia and New Zealand
A spiraling delta outbreak has thrust Qantas Airways' recovery into reverse. New South Wales and Victoria, 
Australia's two most populous states, are in lockdown as authorities rush to accelerate a sluggish vaccination 
program. The prolonged clampdown -- Sydney's late-June lockdown runs until at least the end of September -- has 
forced Qantas to furlough an additional 2,500 workers, taking the total to 9,500. Qantas' domestic flying in July fell 
from 90% of pre-pandemic levels to less than 40%.
Air New Zealand is running a skeleton schedule of services after a nationwide lockdown was extended until Friday. 
The restrictions follow the country's first community covid-19 case since February. New Zealand reported 35 cases 
Monday, taking the current outbreak to 107. www.arkansasonline.com

Irish Ryanair to end operations at two Belfast airports
Irish Ryanair to end operations at two Belfast airports

Highlight: Irish carrier Ryanair has announced plans to cease all its flights at Belfast International Airport and 
Belfast City Airport.
Body
The company will end flights at Belfast City Airport in September and at Belfast International Airport in October. 
Ryanair blamed the UK Government's 'refusal to suspend or reduce air passenger duty (APD), as well as the 
absence of Covid recovery incentives from both the airports'. A tax levied on air passengers, APD differs according 
to destination and class of travel. The carrier informed that the aircraft flying on routes to and from Belfast would be 
'reallocated to lower-cost airports elsewhere in the UK and Europe for the winter schedule, which starts in 
November'. Belfast International Airport said that it will negotiate with other airlines to replace the routes. 
A spokesperson for Belfast International Airport was quoted by BBC as saying: "It is disappointing that Ryanair has 
now decided to withdraw operations from the entire Northern Ireland market at the end of October, having variously 
had a presence in all three local airports in recent years. "It has been a difficult period for aviation and a time when 
consumers need some stability and faith in the Northern Ireland air transport network." Ryanair's services from 
Belfast International Airport included Alicante, Malaga, Milan, Krakow, Gdansk and more. After an 11-year absence, 
the company recommenced flights at Belfast City Airport in May 2021. It has been running flights to and from eight 
destinations in Spain, the Balearic Islands and Italy. The move proves that the demand for flights has remained 
muted due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said that in the 12 
months to the end of March 2022, the airline is projected to fly between 90 million and 100 million people, as 
against the peak of 149 million before the pandemic.

20th August update:
Ryanair continues to invest in the Swedish market by adding more destinations to Stockholm Arlanda and Göteborg 
Landvetter. A new route to Barcelona premiere in conjunction with the opening of the new base and close to twenty-
five new routes at Stockholm Arlanda Airport later this autumn. At the same time, the Irish low-cost carrier continues 
to expand also at Göteborg Landvetter Airport with additional routes for the autumn, now adding Kaunas in 
Lithuania. Wizz Air continues to expand its network at Malmö Airport and increases service with a route to Sarajevo.
Ryanair will start flying to Stockholm Arlanda Airport during the winter season 2021 when it will open a base. With 
the addition of Barcelona, it will involve close to twenty-five European destinations launched by the end of October 
or beginning of November. In conjunction with the set-up of operations, Ryanair will also launch domestic service in 
Sweden for the first time, to Gothenburg and Malmö from Stockholm Arlanda.
Ryanair continues to expand its network also at Göteborg Landvetter. In addition to the planned new domestic route 
to Stockholm in autumn, the airline is at the same time launching service to Riga and Billund and now adding also 
Lithuania's second city, Kaunas.
Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air also see more opportunities in the Swedish market and are increasing their 
service with a new route to Sarajevo from Malmö Airport this winter, starting before Christmas.
- It's rewarding that both Ryanair and Wizz air continue to expand in Sweden. That Ryanair choose to add more 
destinations to the large number of routes they are opening this autumn at both Stockholm Arlanda and Göteborg 
Landvetter, and that Wizz Air choose to launch another new route so shortly after they started operations to Banja 
Luca - shows a clear demand for travel, and is really a sign of the Swedish market's strong position, says Elizabeth 
Axtelius, Director Aviation Business at Swedavia Airports.
Even though travel is still strongly affected by the pandemic, the demand for flights continues to recover. In July, for 
the first time since February 2020, Swedavia's airports had over one million passengers in a single month. At 
Stockholm Arlanda Airport, passenger volume increased nearly 180 per cent compared to July 2020, at Göteborg 
Landvetter Airport there was an overall increase in traffic of 255 per cent and at Malmö Airport over 190 per cent.
Ryanair and Wizz air expand further in Sweden with new routes at Stockholm Arlanda, Göteborg Landvetter 
and Malmö Airport
The EU's new digital Covid travel certificate creates conditions for smoother travel as control procedures can be 
further harmonised for travel within the EU.
Ryanair will serve the Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN) - Barcelona El Prat Airport (BCN) route three times a week 
on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays starting November 2, 2021. Tickets are on sale. For further information 
about current traffic at Stockholm Arlanda Airport: www.swedavia.com/arlanda. For more information about the 
airline: www.ryanair.com.
Ryanair will serve the Göteborg Landvetter Airport (GOT) - Kaunas International Airport (KUN) route twice a week 
on Mondays and Fridays starting November 2, 2021. Tickets are on sale. For further information about current 
traffic at Göteborg Landvetter Airport: www.swedavia.com/landvetter. For more information about the airline: 
www.ryanair.com.
Wizz Air will serve the Malmö Airport (MMX) - Sarajevo International Airport (SJJ) route three times a week on 
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays starting December 14, 2021. Tickets are on sale. For further information about 
current traffic at Malmö Airport: www.swedavia.com/malmo. For more information about the airline: 
www.wizzair.com.
Swedavia complies with the authorities' advice and recommendations on Covid-19. In addition, we comply with 
international aviation industry regulations. For information about the measures Swedavia has introduced for safe 
travel, see for example: www.swedavia.com/arlanda/before-your-journey.
Swedavia has carried out ambitious sustainability work for many years. All ten of its airports achieved the goal of 
zero fossil carbon dioxide emissions from their own operations by year-end 2020. Swedavia also works actively to 
promote the switch to biofuel and has the goal that five per cent of all fuel used for refuelling at Swedish airports 
shall be fossil-free by 2025.

Lukashenko's reliance on Russia comes with risks for Putin Belarus
Lukashenko's reliance on Russia comes with risks for Putin; Belarus

A range of western countries tightened economic sanctions against Belarus this month, one year after mass 
protests first roiled the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko.
In response, Lukashenko turned again to Vladimir Putin, asking the Russian president for debt relief on a $1.5bn 
loan agreed with Moscow last year.
As the west has sought to isolate Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader has put himself ever more in Putin's debt. 
Yet while that may have suited Putin so far, Minsk's increasing dependence on Moscow comes with growing risks 
for the Kremlin too, analysts say.
"A weak Lukashenko is good for Moscow as it can expect greater conditionality, but not if he is so weak as to 
destabilise the situation in the streets," said Alex Kokcharov, principal country risk analyst at IHS Markit in London.
The Belarusian strongman's stand-off with the west escalated after he launched a violent crackdown on popular 
protests sparked by the August 2020 presidential election that critics had described as rigged. Since then, 
Lukashenko has referred to Putin as a partner, a friend and, most recently, a brother, while seeking to repress 
dissent at home and to push back against his European opponents abroad.
He has forced a Ryanair flight bound for Lithuania to land in Minsk and has also sent migrants to Belarus's borders 
with Europein what Brussels has called a "hybrid warfare" campaign against the EU. Poland last week sent 900 
soldiers to stop migrants, some of them Afghans, from crossing over from Belarus.
Lukashenko's reliance on Russia comes with risks for Putin Belarus
Lukashenko's confrontation with the west may suit Putin's purposes in that it weakens the EU and buttresses 
Russia's strategic position by providing Moscow with a buffer. But analysts say it comes with potential political and 
economic costs for Putin as well.
Most immediately, Baltic states have warned that Belarus's "weaponisation" of migration to the EU and imminent 
military exercises involving Russian and Belarusian troops could lead to a border "incident" with Nato troops.
Lukashenko even appears to relish that prospect. "They [the west] should be afraid," he said. "If needed, there will 
be not just a base here [in Belarus]. All the Russian military forces will be based [here] in case of a new world war 
outbreak." "  Then there is the risk to Putin if he continues to support Lukashenko onlyfor the Belarusian president 
totter and fall. Rising Belarusian protests could also spark unease in Russia and poison Moscow's reputation with 
internal opponents to Lukashenko and any eventual successor.
"Last year it was clear that many in Russia were following the protests in Belarus with great interest and Putin and 
his circle are extremely paranoid about protests at home," said Eleanor Bindman, an expert in eastern European 
politics at Manchester Metropolitan University.
Mindful of the risks, Russia's foreign ministry has trodden a careful line. It has said: "Russia will continue providing 
assistance to brotherly Belarus and its people in resisting the western pressure and asserting its sovereignty."
But it has also admitted the existence of "demand for certain political change" in Belarusian society.
As well as the political risks, Moscow faces potential economic and financial costs from the sanctions placed on 
Belarus over the past year by the US, EU, UK, Canada and Switzerland.
Russia is Belarus's biggest trading partner, with about half of its exports and imports, and Russian companies have 
stakes in key Belarusian businesses, including the Mozyr refinery, one of the country's two oil processing 
enterprises.
Russia may face more of this indirect pressure as western countries ratchet up the pressure on Minsk, particularly if 
Lukashenko continues to funnel migrants towards the EU.
Sofya Orlosky, deputy director of Europe and Eurasia programmes at Freedom House, said: "If the west can 
collectively raise the costs ... of supporting authoritarian regimes, it will send a very powerful message that this is 
just not worth it."

 Ryanair's (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) passenger traffic is on course to hit yearly targets, with 10 million passengers 
travelling via the Irish airline in August, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing Chief Executive Michael O'Leary. 
According to O'Leary, the airline's flight bookings for the rest of the year are strong, however, ticker prices remain 
cheap in order to "recover the market very quickly." 
The company expects passenger traffic between 90 million and 100 million people in the 12 months to the end of 
March 2022.

Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) is to cease flying to and from Belfast International Airport.
The airline is also set to cease services from Belfast City Airport at the end of autumn, which will mean it no longer 
has any routes serving Northern Ireland.
"It is disappointing that Ryanair has now decided to withdraw operations from the entire Northern Ireland market at 
the end of October, having variously had a presence in all three local airports in recent years," a spokesperson for 
Belfast International Airport said.
The spokesperson added that the airport has been in talks with airlines, including some that currently do not fly to or 
from Belfast, to take over some of the routes previously flown by Ryanair.
"To this end, we hope to be able to make announcements regarding fresh route development in the near future," 
the spokesperson said.
Irish broadcaster RTE said Ryanair did not respond to requests for an explanation of the reasoning behind the 
latest decision.

 Per Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] CEO Michael O'Leary, the carrier is on track to achieve its current-month 
guidance with respect to passengers to be transported, backed by strong booking trends. This was mentioned in a 
recent Reuters report[2]. 
In July, while reporting first-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Jun 30, 2021) results, this Irish low-cost airline had predicted 
that it will carry more than 10 million passengers in August. With bookings continuing to be impressive, the CEO is 
naturally bullish on the possibility of matching that outlook. 
Expressing his enthusiasm, O'Leary stated: "Ryanair is recovering strongly, much faster than any other airline in 
Europe ... Bookings are increasing very rapidly". 
Ryanair currently expects traffic for fiscal 2022 in the 90-100 million range. The midpoint of this guided range (95 
million) is much higher than the fiscal 2021 traffic of merely 27.5 million. 
In fact, Ryanair's traffic has been improving over the past few months, reflecting the improvement in air-travel 
demand, courtesy of the ramp-up in vaccination drives. Evidently, the carrier transported 1 million passengers in 
April, 1.8 million in May, 5.3 million in June and 9.3 million in July. With bookings remaining strong, O'Leary expects 
August traffic to increase to 10.5 million. Zacks Rank &#38; Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks 
Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings 
Inc. KNX[4],Landstar System, Inc. LSTR[5] and Herc Holdings Inc. HRI[6]. Both Knight-Swift and Landstar currently 
carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Herc Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7]. 
Long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Knight-Swift, Landstar and Herc 
Holdings is pegged at 15%, 12% and 49.2%, respectively. 
 Tech IPOs With Massive Profit Potential 
 In the past few years, many popular platforms and like Uber and Airbnb finally made their way to the public 
markets. But the biggest paydays came from lesser-known names. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) CEO Confident of Meeting August Traffic Target
 For example, electric carmaker X Peng shot up +299.4% in just 2 months. Think of it this way 
 If you had put $5,000 into XPEV at its IPO in September 2020, you could have cashed out with $19,970 in 
November. 
 With record amounts of cash flooding into IPOs and a record-setting stock market, this year's lineup could be even 
more lucrative. See Zacks Hottest Tech IPOs Now  > >[8]

Talking at the CAPA Live on 9-Jun-2021, Ryanair DAC CEO Eddie Wilson spoke with CAPA's senior financial 
analyst Jonathan Wober.
Some of the key highlights can be found below:
JW: Hello and welcome to another CAPA Live, and I'm delighted to give a very warm welcome to Eddie Wilson, 
chief executive of Ryanair DAC, the main operating company of the Ryanair group, which is responsible, I think 
Eddie, if I'm right, for 250-odd aircraft, which I think is 60% of the group total, or thereabouts. So it's a very 
significant airline in its own right. I think in fact, it's the biggest airline fleet in Western Europe.
So Eddie, I'm just going to kick off, I think, by asking you about the current situation where the group is in terms of 
capacity and traffic.
I think the June traffic figures for the group suggested that you're at around about 50% of 2019 seat capacity, so 
pre-COVID levels. But passenger numbers are still a bit below that, at 37%. So what are the plans for the group 
going through the summer and to the end of the year in terms of capacity?
EW: We originally had said we're going to be north of 60% of capacity and reasonably confident for the summer 
months, that we will get up to around 75% to 80% of capacity for this summer. The digital COVID certificate has 
given people the confidence to book
"Yes. I think it's been a relatively strong build, driven by much lower fares coming back from around a million 
passengers in April to the five million as we made our way up into June. I think we're seeing that we originally had 
said we're going to be north of 60% of capacity and reasonably confident for the summer months, that we will get 
up to around 75[%] to 80% of capacity for this summer.
"So you have some countries that were late to the party. I think the EU passport, the digital COVID certificate, has 
given people the confidence to book, and with the UK and Ireland lagging, but I think the UK have with the 
announcement recently by the prime minister that they're getting back to normal, we expect that will make its way 
into travel and we will see the return to travel without restrictions for member countries.
Ryanair 's Eddie Wilson: " You've got to give people confidence"
"So I think it's gradually making its way back and I think that August will really show the level of the snapback, but 
too early to say on that. But I would say somewhere in the region of 75%."

Ryanair will be offering offer four additional destinations
Charleroi, 19 August 2021 - This winter, the airline Ryanair will be launching four new routes from Brussels South 
Charleroi Airport. Lourdes (France), Suceava (Romania), Poznan (Poland) and Tétouan (Morocco) will be available 
to travellers. There will be two flights a week between these new destinations and Brussels-Charleroi.
Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrénées International Airport will be connected to Brussels South Charleroi Airport on 
Wednesdays and Sundays from 31 October 2021 with flights at the following times:
Wednesday:
Brussels-Charleroi - Lourdes: 16.55 - 18.40
Lourdes - Brussels-Charleroi: 19.00 - 20.45
Sunday:
Brussels-Charleroi - Lourdes: 19.05 - 20.50
Lourdes - Brussels-Charleroi: 21.10 - 22.55
Located in the south-west of France, in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées in the Occitanie region, Lourdes is 
mainly known as a religious destination. A Marian shrine and a major pilgrimage site in France, the town welcomes 
millions of people from around the world every year. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, which covers several 
hectares, houses lots of religious buildings, various reception points for the sick, as well as the Grotto of 
Massabielle, also known as the Grotto of the Apparitions.
In addition to its religious appeal, the region has lots to offer, including its lovely natural setting. At an altitude of 
2,877 metres, the Pic du Midi de Bigorre offers a breathtaking view of the Pyrenees from its panoramic terraces. 
The Pyrenees National Park is also popular with walkers, who can take their time admiring the local flora and fauna.
Suceava, a town in the north-west of Romania near the Ukrainian border, will be linked to Brussels-Charleroi on 
Mondays and Fridays from 1 November 2021 with flights at the following times:
New routes from Brussels-Charleroi this winter
Monday:
Brussels-Charleroi - Suceava: 06.30 (local time) - 10.10 (local time)
Suceava - Brussels-Charleroi: 10.35 (local time) - 12.15 (local time)
-Friday:
Brussels-Charleroi - Suceava: 16.25 (local time) - 20.05 (local time)
Suceava - Brussels-Charleroi: 20.30 (local time) - 22.10 (local time)
Built on both banks of the Suceava River, this town is the perfect base from which to explore lots of historic 
buildings, as well as the different monasteries, decorated with typical Bukovina frescoes, which can be found in the 
countryside surrounding the town.
From 1 November 2021, one of Poland's oldest cities will be available from Brussels South Charleroi Airport. Flights 
between Poznan and Brussels-Charleroi will run on Mondays and Fridays at the following times:
Monday:
Poznan - Brussels-Charleroi: 15.55 - 17.35
Brussels-Charleroi - Poznan: 18.00 - 19.40
Friday:
Poznan - Brussels-Charleroi: 15.40 - 17.20
Brussels-Charleroi - Poznan: 17.45 - 19.25
Poznan is the capital of the Greater Poland Voivodeship and can be found in the west of the country. It is an 
important industrial and cultural centre, as well as being a major hub for higher education and science.
You can find out a lot by learning about the history of Poland from Poznan's perspective. Ostrów Tumski (Cathedral 
Island), an island located between the two branches of the river Warta, provides a lovely setting for a walk. The 
island is packed with historical monuments, including its main cathedral, which houses the tombs of Poland's first 
rulers
It's also definitely worth visiting the old town and its Renaissance town hall, with its carillon that attracts many 
tourists every year. Every day at noon, two doors open above the clock, revealing two goats that bang their horns 
twelve times. The Town Hall is also surrounded by a dozen historic houses with brightly coloured façades.
Lastly, Tétouan will be linked to Brussels-Charleroi airport from 1 November 2021 every Monday and Friday with 
flights at the following times:
Monday:
Brussels-Charleroi - Tétouan: 15.00 (local time) - 16.55 (local time)

Brussels-Charleroi - Tétouan: 06.30 (local time) - 08.25 (local time)
Tétouan - Brussels-Charleroi: 08.50 (local time) - 12.45 (local time)
New routes from Brussels-Charleroi this winter
Tétouan is a city in the north of Morocco, in the Western Rif area and not far from the Strait of Gibraltar. It is home 
to some characteristic historic and architectural heritage, with strong Spanish influences. A direct testimony to the 
link between Tétouan and Andalusia, its Medina is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and features 
architecture and art with plenty of Andalusian influences.
However, the three districts of Tétouan belong to very distinct architectural styles. While its Medina bears witness to 
the influences of the Andalusian civilization, both from an architectural point of view and in the way that its centre is 
organised, the El Ensanche district, to the west of the Medina, features the Spanish architectural style of the early 
20th century. The outlying neighbourhoods, which have sprung up as a result of urban migration, are much more in 
keeping with the style and architecture of independence, in other words Tétouan style buildings.
In other news from Ryanair for the winter season, eight more routes will be launched from 29 October, namely: 
Billund (Denmark, from 29/10/2021), Stockholm-Arlanda (Sweden, from 31/10/2021), Helsinki (Finland, from 
02/11/2021), Paphos (Cyprus, from 02/11/2021), Essaouira (Morocco, from 31/10/2021), Trieste (Italy, from 
31/10/2021), Genoa (Italy, from 02/11/2021) and Trapani (Italy, from 31/10/2021).
Philippe VERDONCK, Chief Executive Officer de Brussels South Charleroi Airport, explains:  This news from 
Ryanair brings the number of routes that will be launched this winter to 12. These add to the other flights we already 
offer and will give travellers the opportunity to explore new cities from our airport. Ryanair continues to grow at 
Brussels South Charleroi Airport and we can only thank them for the trust they have placed in all the airport's teams

GullivAir (G2, Sofia) launched its first scheduled route on August 15, 2021, flying daily between Sofia and Burgas.
Flightradar24 ADS-B data shows flights G2211/212 are operated with the airline's sole active aircraft, ATR72-600 
LZ-DAJ (msn 1352). The service is currently scheduled to run at least through the end of the summer season 
although the airline is looking at operating them on a year-round basis.
According to the ch-aviation fleets advanced module, GullivAir's fleet comprises three A330-200s and three ATR72-
600s. However, all three Airbus widebodies are currently parked. One of the trio, LZ-AWZ (msn 874), had been 
active through August 9 on long-haul leisure charters but has since been parked at Sofia airport. In terms of the 
Avions de Transport Régional fleet, GullivAir never fully inducted the other two units, which remain in maintenance, 
into service. The sole active turboprop has been used for leisure charters mainly to Greece and Turkey, but also 
occasionally on domestic sectors.
The privately-owned carrier competes on the route with Bulgaria Air. The flag carrier and Ryanair also connect 
Sofia with Varna, the other Black Sea Bulgarian resort town, the ch-aviation schedules module shows.
GullivAir is also contemplating flights to Ruse in northern Bulgaria in cooperation with local authorities there as soon 
as the derelict airport is refurbished to commercial traffic standards. It would then become the only carrier to serve 
the city. The airline has also been awarded scheduled traffic rights to connect Sofia and Cairo Int'l, although it 
provided no information about its potential launch timeline.
Gullivair is owned by Yanko Ivanov, who is also the founder of BH Air - Balkan Holidays Air (8H, Sofia).

Passenger Traffic in July 2021 During the seventh month of 2021, 423,627 passengers - 258,757 more (+156.9%) 
in comparison with the same time period in 2020 - travelled via the Katowice Airport network.
156,414 people - 42,990 more (+37.9%) than in July 2020 - travelled on regular flights (Wizz Air, Ryanair, LOT 
Polish Airlines, Lufthansa). In July 2021, the following regular destinations were the most popular at Katowice 
Airport: Dortmund (16.1 thousand passengers), Burgas (11.0 thousand), Athens (6.6 thousand), Podgorica (5.5 
thousand) and Catania (5.3 thousand). In the charter flights segment, 265,551 travellers - 214,289 more (+418.0%) 
in comparison with the seventh month of 2020 - were handled. The most popular charter destinations were as 
follows: Antalya (45.3 thousand passengers), Rhodes (17.7 thousand), Zakynthos (17.0 thousand), Hurghada (15.2 
thousand) and Heraklion (14.5 thousand). In July 2021, 3,813 take-offs and landings - 1,287 more (+50.9%) than 
last year - took place.
During the first seven months of 2021, 844,898 passengers were handled, i.e. 19,762 more (+2.4%) in comparison 
with the same time period in 2020. 267,853 travellers - 379,531 fewer (-58.6%) than last year - flew on regular 
flights. On flights handled for travel agencies, 570,697 passengers were noted, i.e. 408,715 more (+252.3%) than in 
the first seven months of 2020.  From January to July, 12,212 take-offs and landings took place, 336 more (+2.8%) 
than last year.
"The number of passengers handled in July 2021 is 64% of the record-breaking pre-pandemic result achieved in 
July 2019. In July 2021, just like in previous months, the traffic at Katowice Airport was dominated by charter flights 
under which 62% of the total number of passengers were handled. Aircraft which realize flights for travel agencies 
have more passengers on board. It is worth emphasizing, however, that the average number of passengers 
travelling on regular flights has considerably improved. When it comes to short-term forecasts, it seems that August 
at Katowice Airport will be better than July. We estimate that 480-490 thousand passengers will be handled during 
the eighth month of 2021.  Traffic during the upcoming autumn/winter season will depend on the pandemic 
situation, i.e. whether it improves or additional restrictions affecting travelling by air are introduced," said Artur 
Tomasik, President of the Management Board of Górnoslaskie Towarzystwo Lotnicze SA, the company managing 
Katowice Airport.
Katowice Airport is among the biggest regional airports in Poland. In 2019, record breaking 4.84 million passengers 
used its flights network; 2 million of them travelled on charter flights. Forecast for 2020 assumed that 5.5 million 
travellers would be handled. Ultimately, due to the coronavirus pandemic, 1.44 million passengers travelled to/from 
Katowice Airport Handles over 420 Thousand passengers
Katowice Airport last year. The airport is the country leader in the area of charter traffic and the regional leader in 
the area of cargo traffic.

A Broadening Effort for Belarus — U.S. Expands Sanctions on the Belarusian Regime, Coordinating with the 
EU, UK and Canada

Aug 17, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 On August 9, 2021, the one-year anniversary of the claimed reelection of Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenka, 
President Biden issued an 'Executive Order on Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation 
in Belarus' (August 9, 2021 Executive Order[1]). The Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC) implemented the executive order by sanctioning[2] 27 individuals and 17 entities related to the Lukashenka 
regime. 
These U.S. actions were part of a coordinated series of sanctions measures imposed alongside those of the United 
Kingdom, the European Union and Canada to hold the Belarusian leader and his regime responsible for election 
misconduct, state-sponsored violence against protesters, and diverting a European air flight over Belarussian 
territory. 
Background The U.S. sanctions regime for Belarus dates to 2006, when President George W. Bush issued 
Executive Order 13405 (E.O. 13405) in response to concerns that the 2006 presidential election had been 
undemocratic. Belarusian leader Mr. Lukashenka, other members of the Government of Belarus (GoB), and several 
companies were designated as Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs). 
The most recent U.S. sanctions actions are in response to the falsification of the 2020 election, the escalating 
repression of the political opposition and peaceful protesters, and the forced diversion of Ryanair Flight FR4978 to 
arrest a dissident journalist on May 23, 2021. On May 28, 2021, the Biden Administration announced that it would 
re-impose full blocking sanctions on nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises that were previously granted relief 
under a series of General Licenses, including the major petrochemical company, Belneftekhim. On June 21, 2021, 
OFAC designated 16 individuals, including Lukashenka's press secretary, and five entities, including the State 
Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (the Belarusian KGB) pursuant to E.O. 13405. Concurrently, the 
State Department issued visa restrictions[3] on 46 Belarusian officials. 
A Broadening Effort for Belarus — U.S. Expands Sanctions on the Belarusian Regime, Coordinating with the 
EU, UK and Canada
The August 9, 2021 Executive Order followed a July visit to Washington, DC, by the Belarusian opposition leader, 
Svyatlana Tshikhanouskaya, to urge the United States to support Belarusian democratic activists and civil society 
groups and put further political and economic pressure on the regime. 
New Executive Order Offers Expanded Scope to Sanctions The August 9, 2021 Executive Order broadens the 
scope of sanctions authority beyond the prior E.O. 13405 to enable the U.S. government to target elements of the 
Lukashenka regime and his support network across various sectors of the Belarusian economy. Most significantly, 
the new executive order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to 
impose sanctions on the following: 
 Leaders and Officials of Entities Sanctioned Under or Engaging in Conduct Sanctionable under E.O. 13405; 
Organs of the GoB—Including political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities of the GoB, including the 
National Bank of the Republic of Belarus; Government Officials—Current or former leaders or officials of the GoB; 
Targeted Economic Sectors—Defense and related materials sector, security sector, energy sector, potassium 
chloride (potash) sector, tobacco products sector, construction sector, or transportation sector of the Belarus 
economy, or any other economic sector as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State; Activities that Undermine Peace, Stability and Democracy in Belarus—Including (a) actions that 
threaten the peace, security, stability, or territorial integrity of Belarus; (b) actions that limit the exercise of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms by individuals in Belarus, or that limit access to the Internet or print, online, or 
broadcast media in Belarus; (c) electoral fraud or other actions that undermined the electoral process; (d) deceptive 
or structured transactions or dealings to circumvent U.S. sanctions; or (e) public corruption; Material Assistance—
Providing material assistance, sponsorship, or financial, material or technological support, or goods or services, for 
any activity described in point (5) above or any person blocked pursuant to the August 9, 2021 Executive Order; or 
Owned or Controlled Entities—Persons that are owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly, the GoB or any person 
blocked pursuant to the August 9, 2021 Executive Order. 
While U.S. officials have the authority to issue sanctions designations on the economic sector participants, 
agencies, parties and activities described above, U.S. primary sanctions prohibitions apply only after persons have 
been subjected to sanctions designations. 
August 9, 2021 Sanctions Designations OFAC's designations significantly broadened sanctions on Belarussian 
state enterprises, individuals operating as sources of funds for the regime, and security services. 
First, OFAC designated two Belarusian state-owned enterprises. Grodno Tobacco Factory Neman (GTF Neman), a 
Belarusian state-owned tobacco factory and a major source of illicit cigarettes in the EU, was designated for 
operating in the tobacco products sector. Belaruskali OAO, a global producer of potassium chloride (potash), was 
designated for operating in the potash sector. OFAC concurrently issued Belarus General License 4 'Authorizing 
the Wind Down of Transactions Involving Belaruskali OAO,' to provide U.S. persons 120 days to wind down 
transactions involving Belaruskali OAO or any entity in which Belaruskali OAO owns a 50 percent or greater 
interest. 
Second, OFAC targeted Lukashenka's 'wallets,' meaning persons operating within various economic sectors that 
receive preferential treatment from the GoB in exchange for demonstrating public support and providing funds both 
for the regime and Lukashenka's personal projects. Specifically, OFAC identified the following: 
 Energy Wallet—Mikalai Varabei, a Belarusian businessman closely tied to Lukashkenka and eight entities within 
his business network (six Belarusian companies, one Ukrainian entity, and Russian-based subsidiary). This 
includes Novopolotsk Limited Liability Company Interservice (Interservice), Closed Joint-Stock Company New Oil 
Company (NNK), and Limited Liability Company Bremino Group (Bremino Group). Tobacco Wallet—Aliaksey 
Aleksin was designated pursuant to E.O. 13405. Two of his former companies, Inter Tobacco and Energo-Oil were 
sanctioned for operating in the tobacco products sector, and Belneftegaz, another company with former ties to 
A Broadening Effort for Belarus — U.S. Expands Sanctions on the Belarusian Regime, Coordinating with the 
EU, UK and Canada
Aleksin, was designated for operating in the transportation sector. Construction Wallet—Dana Holdings Limited 
(Dana Holdings) (a Cyprus-registered firm) and its Belarus subsidiaries were designated for operating in the 
construction sector of the Belarus economy. Dana Holdings has connections to Serbia's Karic family, which 
financially supported Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s and is considered close to Lukashenka. 
Finally, OFAC expanded sanctions on the Belarus security services, designating the Investigative Committee of the 
Republic of Belarus (Belarusian SK), a Belarus law enforcement body that has investigated politically motivated 
criminal cases against human rights organizations and dissidents. OFAC also designated Kanstantsin Bychak, the 
head of the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus' Investigations Department, and several other 
security officials. OFAC already had designated the latter entity on June 21, 2021. 
As a result of the designations, the property and interests in property of the SDNs, as well as entities directly or 
indirectly owned 50 percent or more, individually or in the aggregate, by such SDNs, are blocked where U.S. 
jurisdiction applies. In addition, the SDNs are blocked from entering into the United States. 
A Global Effort 
The U.S. Government has been coordinating pressure on the regime with the UK, Canada and the EU. Those 
governments each have adopted a combination of trade, financial and/or aviation sanctions. 
 EU Sanctions—As of June 24, 2021, the EU[4] had imposed sanctions on 166 individuals and 15 entities in 
Belarus. The EU has imposed economic sectoral sanctions that, among other restrictions, prohibit trade in 
petroleum products and potash, Belarus' leading exports. The EU also has banned the export of equipment, 
technology or software intended primarily for use in the monitoring of the internet and of phone communications as 
well as dual-use goods and technologies for military use. On June 4, 2021, the EU also banned Belarusian carriers 
from its airspace and airports. UK Sanctions—On August 9, 2021, the UK[5] announced a similar package of trade 
and aviation sanctions as that previously imposed by the EU. In addition, the UK imposed financial measures 
prohibiting purchases of transferable securities and money-market instruments issued by the Belarusian state, 
state-owned banks, and the provision of loans. The UK has also engaged in multiple rounds of sanctions 
designations on specific individuals and entities. Canada Sanctions—Canada has issued a series of sanctions on 
Belarusian officials and entities since September 2020. Most recently, on August 9, 2021, Canada announced new 
restrictions on certain activities relating to transferrable securities and money market instruments, debt financing, 
insurance and reinsurance, petroleum products, and potassium chloride products.

Highlight: The airline industry is at the mercy of mother nature as climate change begins to rear its ugly head, 
causing significant headaches. Last month, more than 300 flights were delayed, and eight flights were cancelled at 
Denver International Airport due to heavy smoke from extensive wildfires in Oregon, California, and Idaho. In early 
August, American Airlines cancelled 350 flights at Fort Worth Airport in Texas due to storms.

Climate change is also putting coastal airports at risk. San Francisco Airport plans to spend $587m on a shoreline 
protection wall around the entire perimeter of the airport to protect the airport from rising sea levels.  As the 
frequency of climate-related extreme weather events increases, airlines should brace themselves for further 
disruptions and infrastructure damage and make plans to adapt to these future possibilities. Airlines are coming 
under fireInvestors are beginning to crack down on airlines' lobbying activities. 
In June of this year, the majority of Delta Air Line Inc's shareholders voted in favour of making the airline disclose its 
climate lobbying activities. According to the think tank InfluenceMap, several airlines, Air France-KLM, IAG, 
Lufthansa, and Ryanair, have pursued lobbying initiatives to oppose stricter European Union (EU) environmental 
regulations while simultaneously employing climate-related PR and ad campaigns. Blatant greenwashing. The 
policies that these companies oppose include the full inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System, 
kerosene fuel taxes, and ticket taxes on flights. The sector is under considerable pressure to address rising carbon 
emissions. In 2020 aviation accounted for 2.5% of all human-induced (CO2) emissions. Environmental campaigners 
have urged airlines to reduce emissions from flights rather than relying on carbon offsets - the preferred method for 
airlines. Both European and US airlines have publicly committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. However, 
these commitments are significantly undermined by the lobbying activities by companies in the sector. Airlines will 
be relying on the expansion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which advocates say can reduce GHG emissions 
by up to 75% relative to conventional jet fuel. Derived from renewable feedstock, SAF is one of the most viable 
short-term options to reduce the industry's carbon footprint significantly. However, reaching the SAF goal will 
require an 84% annual average increase in SAF production through 2030. Airlines are taking action, United has 
partnered with Fulcrum BioEnergy to develop sustainable aviation fuel refineries located near US hubs. These 
refineries will produce nearly one billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel for United in their first 10 years of 
After Covid-19, climate change is the next challenge for the airline industry
operation. JetBlue recently announced its aim to source 10% of its total jet fuel from SAF by 2030. Electric air travel 
is yet to take offAirline operators are also exploring the possibility of electric air travel. For instance, JetBlue and 
Boeing have invested in electric plane startup Zunum Aero. In May 2021, Amazon announced that, via its Climate 
Pledge Fund, it had invested in BETA Technologies, which is developing an electric vertical take-off and landing 
(eVTOL) aircraft capable of carrying three cargo pallets or up to six people with zero operational emissions. While 
electric aircraft could solve carbon emissions and noise pollution issues, technology constraints remain the most 
significant barrier to widespread adoption.

Aug 17, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 On 4 June 2021, the EU imposed a prohibition on Belarusian air carriers from landing in, taking off from or 
overflying the territory of the EU, in response to the forced Ryanair flight in Minsk on 23 May (Council Regulation 
(EU) 2021/907[1] and Council Decision (CFSP) 2021/908[2]). On 21 June 2021, additional persons were added to 
the list of persons subject to asset freezing measures (Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/997[3] and 
Council Implementing Decision (CFSP) 2021/1002[4]; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/999[5] and 
Council Decision (CFSP) 2021/1001[6]). On 24 June 2021, the EU adopted further comprehensive restrictions 
through Council Regulation (EU) 2021/1030[7] and Council Decision (CFSP) 2021/1031[8] on a significant part of 
the Belarusian economy. 
On 21 June 2021, the UK added additional persons to the list of persons subject to asset freezing measures under 
The Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019[9]. On 9 August 2021, the UK adopted an 
additional package of trade, financial, and aviation sanctions on Belarus through The Republic of Belarus 
(Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) Regulations 2021[10], that is similar to the comprehensive restrictions adopted 
by the EU in June 2021. 
Please find below an overview of EU and UK sanctions that corporates must observe when doing business in or 
with Belarus. 
 Targeted economic sanctions 
Equipment/technology 
 The EU imposed a prohibition on the direct and indirect sale, supply, transfer, or export of equipment, technology 
or software intended primarily for use in the monitoring or interception of the internet and of telephone 
communications by or on behalf of the Belarusian authorities. Listed items not used for these uses require an export 
licence before they are exported to any party in Belarus or for use in Belarus. 
 The products covered by this prohibition include: Deep Packet Inspection equipment Network Interception 
equipment including Interception Management Equipment (IMS) and Data Retention Link Intelligence equipment 
Radio Frequency monitoring equipment Network and Satellite jamming equipment Remote Infection equipment

monitoring or interception services of any kind to, or for the direct or indirect benefit of, the Belarusian Government, 
public bodies, corporations and agencies or any natural or legal person or entity acting on their behalf or at their 
direction. 
The UK imposed a similar prohibition on the direct and indirect sale, supply, transfer, and export of goods, 
technology, and software that may be used for interception and monitoring services. 
 Dual-use and military items 
 The EU imposed a prohibition on the direct or indirect sale, supply, transfer, or export to anyone in Belarus of dual-
use goods and technologies for military end-use. 
Additionally, it is prohibited to sell, supply, or transfer dual-use items to certain listed parties in Belarus, as well as 
on the provision of related technical assistance, brokering services, financing, or financial assistance or other 
related services to listed parties. At the time of writing this update, the EU has not identified the Belarusian parties 
subject to this prohibition. 
This prohibition does not apply to the export of dual-use goods and technology or the provision of related technical 
or financial assistance for the maintenance and safety of existing civil nuclear capabilities for non-military use or for 
a non-military end-user. 
EU restrictive measures also prohibit the provision of technical assistance related to goods listed in the EU 
Common Military List. 
The UK imposed a similar prohibition on the sale, export, supply, delivery, transfer, and making available to anyone 
in Belarus of dual-use goods and technologies for military end-use. In addition the UK imposed a prohibition on the 
provision of technical assistance and financial services to a person connected with Belarus or for military use in 
Belarus in connection to arrangements relating to dual-use items and military end-use technologies. 
 Potash/Tobacco 
 The EU and the UK each imposed restrictions on trade in potassium chloride (potash) and tobacco products, as 
follows: 
 It is prohibited to sell, supply, transfer, or export certain listed items used for the production or manufacturing of 
tobacco products to any person, entity, or body in Belarus or for use in Belarus. Listed goods in the EU regime 
include filters, papers for cigarettes, flavours for tobacco, and machinery for preparing or making up of tobacco. It is 
prohibited to import, purchase or transfer, directly or indirectly, certain listed products of potash and chemical or 
mineral fertilisers containing potassium from Belarus, regardless of their origin. 
The restrictions in the EU regime allow for the grandfathering of existing contracts concluded before 25 June 2021 
or ancillary contracts necessary for the execution of such contracts. 
 Petroleum products 
 The EU and the UK each imposed restrictions on trade in petroleum products, as follows: 
The EU and UK adopt additional comprehensive sanctions on Belarus
 It is prohibited to: Import certain listed petroleum products originating in Belarus or exported from Belarus. 
Purchase petroleum products located in or originating in Belarus. Transport petroleum products originating in 
Belarus, or are being exported from Belarus to any other country. Provide, directly or indirectly, technical 
assistance, brokering services, financing or financial assistance, including financial derivatives, as well as insurance 
and re-insurance, related to listed petroleum products. Petroleum products covered by these restrictions are those 
classified under CN 2710, 2711, 2712, 2713, and 2715. An exception is made for purchases of listed petroleum 
products which are required in order to meet the essential needs of the purchaser in Belarus or of humanitarian 
projects in Belarus. The UK regime makes an additional exception for petroleum products acquired in Belarus by an 
individual on a retail basis, for that individual's personal use. 
The restrictions in the EU regime allow for the grandfathering of existing contracts concluded before 25 June 2021 
or ancillary contracts necessary for the execution of such contracts. 
 Investment services/loans/credit 
 Under the new EU regime: 
 It is prohibited to directly or indirectly purchase, sell, provide investment services for or assistance in the issuance 
of, or otherwise deal with transferable securities and money-market instruments with a maturity exceeding 90 days, 
issued after 29 June 2021 by the Belarussian government and Belarusian public bodies and entities, or 
Belarusbank, Belinvestbank, and Belagroprombank (or any non-EU legal entity directly or indirectly owned by more 
than 50 percent by these three credit institutions or any legal entity acting on behalf of or at the direction of the 
above entities or bodies). It is also prohibited to directly or indirectly make or be part of any arrangements to provide 
new loans or credit with a maturity exceeding 90 days, after 29 June 2021 to the Republic of Belarus, its 
Government, its public bodies, corporations or agencies, or Belarusbank, Belinvestbank, and Belagroprombank (or 
any non-EU legal entity directly or indirectly owned by more than 50 percent by these three credit institutions or any 
legal entity acting on behalf of or at the direction of the above entities or bodies). EU Member States may grant an 
authorisation for the purpose of providing support to the Belarussian population (humanitarian assistance, 
environmental projects, nuclear safety). There are exceptions concerning legitimate trade financing between the EU 
and third countries, as well as drawdowns or disbursements made under pre-existing contracts (i.e., contracts 
concluded before 25 June 2021). 
The UK has imposed a similar prohibition on the direct and indirect purchase, sale, provision of investment services 
and other forms of dealings in transferable securities and money-market instruments with a maturity exceeding 90 
days issued by a 'relevant person' after 9 August 2021. In addition, the UK has imposed a similar prohibition on the 
direct and indirect making available of loans and other credit arrangements with a maturity exceeding 90 days to 
'relevant persons.' 'Relevant persons' include Belarus and Belarusian authorities, as well as credit and financial 
institutions majority owned by, and other entities wholly owned by, Belarus or Belarusian authorities. The 
prohibitions do not apply to loans first made or granted at any time prior to 9 August 2021. 
 Insurance/re-insurance and EIB financing 
 Under the new EU regime it is prohibited to provide insurance and re-insurance to the Belarussian government and 
Belarusian public bodies and entities, while there are certain restrictions on the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 
relation to projects in the public sector. The EIB will stop any disbursement or payment under any existing 
agreements in relation to projects in the public sector and any existing Technical Assistance Service Contracts. 
Member states will also be required to take actions to limit the involvement in Belarus of multilateral development 
banks of which they are members. 
The UK has imposed a similar prohibition on the provision of insurance and re-insurance to the Belarussian 
government and Belarusian authorities and entities. The prohibition does not prohibit compliance with insurance 
and reinsurance agreements concluded before 9 August 2021. 
 Asset freezing measures 
 To date, the EU has imposed asset-freezing measures against 166 individuals and 15 entities. EU persons are 
prohibited from making available, directly or indirectly, funds or economic resources to listed parties. The UK has 
The EU and UK adopt additional comprehensive sanctions on Belarus
imposed asset-freezing measures against 100 individuals and nine entities. UK persons are prohibited from making 
available, directly or indirectly, funds or economic resources to listed parties. 
 Restrictions in relation to aircraft carriers 
 The EU imposed a specific prohibition on Belarusian air carriers from landing in, taking off from or overflying the 
territory of the EU, including as a marketing carrier in code-sharing or blocked-space arrangements. There are 
exemptions or authorisations for emergency landings and flights with a humanitarian purpose. 
The UK imposed a specific prohibition on Belarusian air carriers from overflying or landing in the UK, and a 
prohibition on the provision of technical assistance related to aircrafts listed in UK Statutory Guidance[11] where 
this is provided to or for the benefit of specific designated persons. 
 Next steps 
 These new sanctions are expected to have a significant impact on EU and UK companies trading with Belarus, 
who will need to comply with relevant restrictions. Companies doing business in or with Belarus are required to 
assess their risk exposure to the new measures and take appropriate due diligence measures to allow them to 
remain compliant.

Austria Lanserhof, the health resort in the village of Lans, just outside Innsbruck, has launched a series of packages 
aimed at tackling long Covid. The resort (pictured right), which opened in 1984, is known for its detoxification and 
"fasting cure" programmes but has expanded to offer a wide range of medical treatments and has launched 
outposts in Hamburg, London and Bavaria. The new long Covid programmes feature regular examinations and 
treatment sessions including breathing therapy and simulated altitude training, as well as fasting and nutritional 
analysis designed to reduce inflammation. The two-week programmes cost from (EURO)8,817 per person, 
including accommodation. Lanserhof isn't alone in seeing a potential market in post-Covid therapy - the new Rakxa 
spa in Bangkok and the SHA Wellness Clinic in Alicante, Spain, have both also launched packages.

I screamed, smothered by a black bag, and they laughed. They said: 'Don't scream. Your Tsikhanouskaya won't 
hear you.'" This is how Stsiapan Latypau, a political prisoner in Belarus, recalled his arrest in his final statement in a 
Minsk "court" last Thursday. His speech was dignified and eloquent, devoid of spite and hate, even as he spoke of 
beatings and torture.
I do hear you, Stsiapan. And I urge the democratic community of the world to hear you, too.
Stsiapan's story illustrates the crisis my country is going through. Since the stolen presidential election of August 
2020, more than 35,000 people have been detained in Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko's regime has launched 
4,691 politically motivated criminal cases. Viasna, a human rights centre, recognises 631 people as political 
prisoners and has received 4,644 allegations of torture. As many as 10 people have lost their lives.
This campaign of relentless repression is the regime's response to a non-violent uprising that has swept Belarus 
since last August. On Monday we will celebrate the anniversary of the "Freedom March", when more than 200,000 
people in Minsk took to the streets in an entirely peaceful action to demand new, free elections and to protest 
against regime-inspired violence. Since then, protests have taken place almost every day all over Belarus.
Besides their repression of innocent citizens, the authorities in Belarus have become a security problem for the rest 
of Europe. In May, the regime's agents hijacked a Ryanair plane en route from Athens to Vilnius to capture Roman 
Protasevich, a citizen-journalist who was on board.
The Belarus dictatorship is destined to collapse
Vitaly Shishov, a Belarusian community leader, was found hanged in a park in Kyiv, capital of Ukraine, two weeks 
ago. The regime is facilitating the passage of migrants from Iraq to Lithuania, Latvia and Poland. As a result, 
Lithuania and Latvia have declared a state of emergency. These events demonstrate that unless Belarusians are 
safe, no other European citizens are safe either.
In this situation, I urge the democratic community to stay true to our common values and to take action. As I have 
emphasised in my meetings with US president Joe Biden at the White House and with Boris Johnson, the British 
prime minister, in London, Belarus stands today on the frontline of a broader struggle between autocracy and 
democracy.
Democratic countries have a moral obligation to support us. Assistance programmes for civil society and 
independent media in Belarus are of crucial importance. We also welcome the sanctions announced by the British 
government, the EU and the Biden administration on the regime's enterprises and its representatives that are 
funding and carrying out repressions. Sanctions deprive the regime of resources, destroy the corrupt schemes of its 
cronies and split the elites. However, for sanctions to be effective, it is vital to remove loopholes in them.
Lawlessness caused by the impunity of the regime is the main reason why the people of Belarus are experiencing 
such suffering. Sanctions are the most effective way to stop it. To the same end, the International Criminal Court 
should initiate proceedings on the crimes that the Belarusian dictatorship is committing. The UN could start this 
process by putting Belarus on the agendas of the General Assembly and Security Council.
The dictatorship is destined for collapse, even though the illegitimate ruler of Belarus, who has held the country in 
his grip since 1994, is trying to buy more time for himself. State propaganda has been promoting the idea of a 
referendum on constitutional reform as a way to "move on" from the crisis. However, no solution is possible without 
dismantling the dictatorial system. At the same time, an attempt to fake reform might be the trigger that causes a 
collapse.
We, the democratic movement of Belarus, will be prepared. We have laid the groundwork for a way out of the crisis 
through holding free elections under international observation. We propose an international high-level conference 
that can lead to negotiations. The
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is ready to be a platform for dialogue on new elections.
I have met with the heads of state of 31 countries, and I have made 22 working visits to make sure that Belarus will 
have friends to rely on during the transition to democracy. We have worked together with the European 
Commission in Brussels to develop a comprehensive plan of economic support for a future democratic Belarus.
We have drafted policies for the conduct of free and fair elections within 60 days. We are putting in place 
mechanisms for the release of political prisoners, for the rehabilitation of victims of regime repression and for the 
national reconciliation that will be essential after the democratic transition.
Belarus can and will be a success story of Europe. In 2020, we put our country on the map as a place defined by 
dignified, daring, peaceful people struggling for democracy. We have learnt that the path to freedom is long and 
difficult. But we are closer than ever to achieving it. We will not miss our chance.

government, the EU and the Biden administration on the regime's enterprises and its representatives that are 
funding and carrying out repressions. Sanctions deprive the regime of resources, destroy the corrupt schemes of its 
cronies and split the elites. However, for sanctions to be effective, it is vital to remove loopholes in them.
Lawlessness caused by the impunity of the regime is the main reason why the people of Belarus are experiencing 
such suffering. Sanctions are the most effective way to stop it. To the same end, the International Criminal Court 
should initiate proceedings on the crimes that the Belarusian dictatorship is committing. The UN could start this 
process by putting Belarus on the agendas of the General Assembly and Security Council.
The dictatorship is destined for collapse, even though the illegitimate ruler of Belarus, who has held the country in 
his grip since 1994, is trying to buy more time for himself. State propaganda has been promoting the idea of a 
referendum on constitutional reform as a way to "move on" from the crisis. However, no solution is possible without 
dismantling the dictatorial system. At the same time, an attempt to fake reform might be the trigger that causes a 
collapse.
We, the democratic movement of Belarus, will be prepared. We have laid the groundwork for a way out of the crisis 
through holding free elections under international observation. We propose an international high-level conference 
that can lead to negotiations. The
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is ready to be a platform for dialogue on new elections.
I have met with the heads of state of 31 countries, and I have made 22 working visits to make sure that Belarus will 
have friends to rely on during the transition to democracy. We have worked together with the European 
Commission in Brussels to develop a comprehensive plan of economic support for a future democratic Belarus.
We have drafted policies for the conduct of free and fair elections within 60 days. We are putting in place 
mechanisms for the release of political prisoners, for the rehabilitation of victims of regime repression and for the 
national reconciliation that will be essential after the democratic transition.
Belarus can and will be a success story of Europe. In 2020, we put our country on the map as a place defined by 
dignified, daring, peaceful people struggling for democracy. We have learnt that the path to freedom is long and 
difficult. But we are closer than ever to achieving it. We will not miss our chance.
The writer is the leader of the democratic movement of Belarus
Besides the repression of citizens, the regime has become a security problem for the rest of Europe

Major Airline Forces 12-Year-Old Autistic Boy To Undergo COVID-19 Test Despite Exemption
Major Airline Forces 12-Year-Old Autistic Boy To Undergo COVID-19 Test 
Despite Exemption

 Employees of a major airline reportedly made an autistic boy with an exemption letter take a COVID-19 test before 
allowing him to board his flight, the BBC reported Thursday. Ryanair employees forced Callum Hollingsworth, 12, 
who has autism[1] as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), to take a COVID-19 nasal swab test 
before being allowed to travel[2] home to the U.K. from Spain last week, his mother Katie told the BBC[3]. Callum 
had a letter from his doctor exempting him from testing, which the U.K.'s COVID-19 guidance[4]recognizes. 
Ryanair[5] staff insisted on administering the test despite the letter, his mother told the BBC. 'The staff were just 
ignoring us. All they kept saying was 'it's not our problem,'' she said. WATCH: Ryanair has apologised, after staff at 
Valencia airport forced Callum, 12, from Harlow, to have a Covid test despite being exempt because of his autism. 
Callum's dad filmed the incident. pic.twitter.com/AHkmnTrJ2M[6] — BBC Essex (@BBCEssex) August 12, 2021[7] 
Callum can be seen sobbing and shaking in the video of the incident as employees raised their voices while 
attempting to administer the test[8]. 'My husband then had to physically restrain my son with two members of staff 
to try to get him to have a test,' Katie Hollingsworth told the BBC. Callum was previously tested for COVID-19 in 
January, his mother told the BBC, but the experience was so traumatic his doctor wrote an exemption letter for 
future testing. 'The fact that he didn't need this one made it even worse because we'd told him the previous one 
was going to be his one and only test,' Katie Hollingsworth said. A Ryanair spokesperson told the BBC the 
company 'regrets to hear of the stress' the Hollingsworth family experienced, citing constantly changing COVID-19 
guidelines as the reason for its mistake. Ryanair did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's 
request for comment. Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any

 Vitaly Shishov left Belarus last year after joining protests against its autocratic leader, Alexander Lukashenko. He 
settled in Kyiv, where he ran Belarusian House in Ukraine, a nonprofit group to support people fleeing his home 
country. 
But after leaving his home to go for a jog last Monday, 'he never came back', said Kvitka Perehinets in the Kyiv 
Post[1].The next day, he was found hanged from a tree in a park. His face was bruised, his nose broken. And while 
there's no definitive proof he was killed, his organisation is in no doubt about who was responsible. 'This was a 
planned operation of the Belarus security forces to liquidate a person truly dangerous for the regime,' it said. 
He was found just a day after Belarusian Olympic sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya was forced to take refuge in 
Poland's embassy in Tokyo, saying she'd been taken to the airport against her will and was in fear of punishment 
after criticising her national coaches. 
Shishov, who had recently complained of being followed, isn't the first Belarusian opposition figure to be found 
hanged, said Kirill Krivosheev in Kommersant (Moscow): at least three others in the past 11 years have suffered the 
same fate. But he is the first to have been found in the territory of another state. 
The alleged killing follows the arrest of activist Roman Protasevich following the forced landing of a Ryanair plane 
he was travelling on in Minsk in May, said Dmitry Solomchuk in Ukrayinska Pravda (Kyiv). It adds to the sense that 
Lukashenko, who quashed protests sparked by his disputed election win last year, will 'stop at nothing to hold on to 
power'. Yet it could backfire, forcing the international community - not least Ukraine, which has close economic ties 
to Belarus - to cut diplomatic ties with Lukashenko's regime and impose tougher sanctions. 
As for Tsimanouskaya, her fear of retribution was wellfounded, said Jerzy Haszczynski in Rzeczpospolita[2] 
(Warsaw). Several Belarusian athletes who supported the 2020 protests - including a champion kickboxer and a 
footballer - are in prison; others lost their jobs. 
Tsimanouskaya is now in Poland, together with her husband. Many other Belarusians have fled to Lithuania, 
including opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who took on Lukashenko in last year's poll (and held talks with 
Boris Johnson last week). These cases show that Lukashenko has no respect for borders in his quest to crush 
dissent, said Roman Olearchyk in the FT[3]. For thousands of Belarusians living in exile, the message is chillingly 
clear: 'No one is safe.'

Aug 13, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 On Monday, August 9, 2021, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury 
issued a multitude of sanctions designations affecting dealings with Belarusian companies in the construction, oil, 
coal, tobacco, and other commodities sectors. The new designations rely on existing Belarus sanctions authority 
under Executive Order 13405 (June 20, 2006), which was issued to counter alleged human rights abuses, political 
repression, and the undermining of democratic processes or institutions in Belarus. The stated bases for Monday's 
sanctions actions were 'the continuing violent crackdown on peaceful protests,' the 'May 23, 2021 Ryanair incident' 
and other activities considered to 'profit from or sustain the Belarusian regime at the expense of the Belarusian 
people.' Monday's Order authorizes the imposition of sanctions on, among others, any person determined 'to 
operate or have operated in the defense and related material sector, security sector, energy sector, potassium 
chloride (potash) sector, tobacco products sector, construction sector, or transportation sector of the economy of 
Belarus,' as well as any person determined to have 'materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, 
or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of,' any person who is designated under the 
Order. 
Who was sanctioned under Monday's Order? 
The new designations target 23 individuals and 21 entities, including various revenue-generating enterprises for 
President Lukashenka's regime—referred to by the US Treasury Department as 'Lukashenka's wallets'—including 
those in the tobacco, construction, and energy, transportation, and potash and other commodities sectors. Also 
targeted are certain senior Belarus government officials, the Belarusian security services, and the Belarusian 
National Olympic Committee. 
Considered a key actor in Lukashenka's 'energy wallet,' OFAC has designated Belarusian businessman Mikalai 
Varabei, reportedly a member of Lukashenka's inner circle with enterprises extending into the Ukraine and Russia. 
OFAC announces new sanctions targeting Belarus ' construction, coal, oil, tobacco, potash and transportation 
sector
Accordingly, OFAC also designated BelKazTrans and BelKazTrans Ukraine—two companies involved in the 
transport of coal in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine—as owned or controlled by Varabei. 
OFAC also sanctioned for operating in the energy sector Novopolotsk Limited Liability Company Interservice 
(Interservice), one of the largest oil traders in Belarus, and Closed Joint-Stock Company New Oil Company (NNK), 
the only private company permitted to export petroleum products from Belarus state-owned refineries. 
Absolutbank, a financial institution in Belarus, and Industrial Unitary Enterprise Oil Bitumen Plant (OBP) were also 
designated for being owned or controlled by Interservice, and Limited Liability Company New Oil Company East 
(NNK East), a subsidiary of petroleum product exporter NNK, was designated for being owned or controlled by 
NNK. 
Lastly, Limited Liability Company Bremino Group (Bremino Group), which is also linked to Varabei and was granted 
a presidential decree to manage a special economic zone in Lukachenka's home region, was designated for 
operating in the Belarusian transportation sector. Meanwhile, Belaruskali OAO, one of the world's largest producers 
of fertilizer ingredient potassium chloride (potash) and reportedly a source of revenue and foreign currency for the 
Lukashenka regime, was designated for being owned or controlled by the government of Belarus and for operating 
in the potash sector of the Belarusian economy. 
The European Union (EU) hadpreviously sanctioned[1]both NNK and Bremino Group on June 24, 2021, along with 
broad sectors of the Belarusian economy, including financial services, insurance, telecommunications, technology, 
oil and gas, shipping and maritime, mineral and mining, agriculture and tobacco enterprises. 
Expansion of Biden Administration Sanctions Targeting Belarus 
These latest OFAC designations follow other recent sanctions actions by the Biden Administration targeting the 
Lukachenka regime. InApril 2021[2], OFAC revoked wind-down General License 2H and imposed, as of June 3, 
2021, comprehensive sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned entities and their 50%-or-more owned 
subsidiaries: 
 Belarusian Oil Trade House (a transaction clearinghouse) Belneftekhim (a petrochemical company) Belneftekhim 
USA, Inc. (US unit of petrochemical company Belneftekhim) Belshina OAO (a tire manufacturing company) Grodno 
Azot OAO (a fertilizer producing company) Grodno Khimvolokno OAO (a large manufacturing company) 
Lakokraska OAO (a paint and varnish manufacturing company) Naftan OAO (an oil-refining company) Polotsk 
Steklovolokno OAO (a fiberglass manufacturing company).

Flight FR4978 interception: what's the threat response?
Flight FR4978 interception: what's the threat response?

Highlight: On May 23, Ryanair flight FR4978 was travelling from Athens to Vilnius Airport in Lithuania. During the 
flight, air traffic controllers in Belarus allegedly provided the Ryanair pilots with false information about a bomb on 
board to divert the plane's flight path to land in Minsk.
Body
Once the plane landed, local authorities arrested two of its passengers: the anti-government activist and journalist 
Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega. After several hours of delays, the flight was allowed to continue 
to its original destination.  There were also reports that a Belarusian military jet was deployed to escort flight 
FR4978 to Minsk. Authorities in Belarus have disputed all these claims, with national air force chief Igor Golub 
stating: "There was no interception, no forced diversion from the state border or forced landing of the Ryanair 
plane."  As a consequence of the incident, the EU and UK banned Belarusian planes from their airports and 
suggested that airlines avoid flying over Belarus. The International Civil Aviation Organization is currently 
investigating the incident to determine exactly what happened.  Nevertheless, what happened on FR4978 was a 
reminder that despite all the increased safety procedures for air travel since 9/11, airliners remain vulnerable to 
outside interference while in the air.  Dealing with interference on a flightThe main priority of an aircraft crew is to 
ensure the safety of all the passengers on board. Any potential threats need to be taken seriously, with pilots 
working with air traffic control to determine the best possible course of action in the circumstances.    There are 
internationally recognised treaties regarding offences that take place on aircraft, notably the Tokyo Convention on 
Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft. 
This was ratified by 185 nations in 1969 and gave pilots the ability to take action in certain circumstances.  
Examples of actions pilots can take include the ASSIST principle - acknowledge, separate, silence, inform, support, 
time. Should an aircraft get into trouble during a flight, the captain can also send a transponder code, or squawk 
code, over the radio to quickly and concisely let authorities know what is happening.  In the event of a hijacking, the 
internationally recognised code is 7500. If it is transmitted, the affected aircraft will be tracked closely by air traffic 
control. Military jets can also be deployed to escort the plane to the land at the nearest airport. Failure to comply 
could see the airliner shot down as a last resort.  There are also transponder codes for numerous other incidents 
such as mechanical emergencies or a communications outage.   Training can prepare pilots for many scenarios

they may one day experience in the air. However, according to ex-British Airways pilot Terry Tozer, there is no 
current training scenario that would have prepared a pilot for what happened on the diverted Ryanair flight.  "Your 
training would be to take air traffic control very seriously, because their job is to look after you, not play games with 
you," says Tozer. "You wouldn't have specific training for an event like that, because I've never heard of it 
happening before. That's the first time I've heard air traffic control actually interfering with a flight. They just don't do 
that. "The real question since this has happened is: What happens in future? The problem now is if a credible threat 
did come up. Let's just say there was a dispute between the country your aircraft is registered in and the country 
you're flying over. If they told you that there was something like [flight FR4978], would you believe them or not?"   
Threat assessment and responseTozer says the bigger airlines have a security department, with operations 
specialists who assess potential threats as they occur to determine what is credible and then recommend the best 
course of action.  "If you're a major airline, there'll be somewhere you go through that's dodgy," he explains. "They 
have people who assess the threats, and there would be threat levels. They would have a system."  "Major airlines 
have a security department. They have direct links with the security services. And BA, when I was there, would 
have risk levels. They had a team of people who worked on this all the time, long before September 11.  "At the end 
of the day, the decision always comes down to the captain. Because you only do what operations want if it's safe to 
do so; if the weather's all right, and all that. There are lots of variables."  A commercial airliner being intercepted by 
a military aircraft is rare. Pilots have little option but to comply when approached by military aircraft mid-air. A pilot 
must ensure the safety of all passengers on board, and commercial airliners are not equipped with military-grade 
defences or advanced manoeuvrability.  "If the intent is hostile - or perceived to be that - there is no choice," says 
Suren Ratwatte, qualified pilot and ex-CEO of Sri Lankan Airlines. "From the skipper's point of view, an actual 
intercept by fighters is pretty straightforward. ICAO rules have the protocol and you don't have much of a choice. 
The safety of the passengers and aircraft is paramount, so pretty much anyone will comply."  Impact on passenger 
confidenceThe diversion of the Ryanair flight came at a time when the air travel industry is looking to increase 
flights after being largely grounded since March 2020 by Covid-19 restrictions. However, according to Gus Gardner, 
GlobalData associate travel and tourism analyst, the incident is not expected to affect consumer confidence in the 
long term. "The interception of an aircraft by a military jet is a rare occurrence, however, it can be rather distressing 
for those on board. Depending on the severity of the incident, there is likely to be an impact on consumer 
confidence - especially if flying around the region surrounding Belarus," says Gardner. "The fact that airlines are 
avoiding Belarusian airspace is a step in the right direction to restoring air travel confidence. Governments acted 
swiftly, and airlines immediately implemented their advice which should have restored confidence quickly.  
"However, the events have reaffirmed to passengers the importance of understanding who they are flying with and 
the route the aircraft will take. If passengers believed a flight might enter airspace of concern, then they are likely to 
think twice about booking or proceeding with their flight. "The long-term impact of this incident is likely to be 
minimal. The aviation industry is incredibly resilient, passengers often forget about incidents quickly, and confidence 
will rise again."

CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing easily beat rival Airbus in orders for new planes last month, but Chicago-based Boeing 
trailed its European rival in delivering planes to airline customers.
Boeing said Tuesday that it took orders for 31 planes in July while 17 others were canceled, resulting in a net gain 
of 14. That compared with two orders for Airbus.
It was Boeing’s sixth straight month of positive net orders after seeing cancellations exceed orders for most of 2020. 
Boeing has reported 270 net orders so far in 2021.
Brazil’s Gol ordered nine 737 Max jets last month and Dallas-based Southwest Airlines ordered six.
Boeing delivered 28 planes in July, including nine 737 Max jets sent to Irish airline Ryanair. That fell short of Airbus, 
which delivered 47 planes last month.
For the year, Boeing has delivered 184 planes — more than all of 2020 — despite another halt in shipping its 787 
jet because of production flaws in the fuselage and nose. Last month, the company said it will cut production of 
787s.
Deliveries are critical for aircraft companies because buyers usually pay much of the purchase price when they get 
the plane.
Boeing shares rose more than 1% in afternoon trading.

Aug 10, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 On August 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order[1] (E.O.) authorizing the imposition of additional 
sanctions on the Government of Belarus and a number of key sectors of the Belarusian economy in coordination 
with the United Kingdom[2] and Canada[3], which also expanded sanctions on Belarus. The E.O. authorizes the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to impose sanctions on parties that are a part of the 'Government of 
Belarus,' any entities owned or controlled by the government, and entities operating in the security, energy, 
potassium chloride (potash), tobacco, construction, or transportation sectors of the Belarusian economy, among 
others. 
Pursuant to the new E.O. and existing authorities, OFAC added 23 individuals and 21 entities[4] to its List of 
Specially Designated Nationals (SDN List) yesterday, broadly prohibiting U.S. persons from conducting business 
with the newly sanctioned parties and freezing any sanctioned party property subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Among 
others, OFAC targeted Belarusian oligarchs Mikalai Varabei and Aliaksey Aleksin and the Serbia-based Karic family 
and their holdings in Belarus. Companies associated with these parties include significant players in the Belarusian 
energy, cargo, and tobacco industries. OFAC also designated Belaruskali OAO, a major producer of potash, 
Grodno Tobacco Factory Neman, and several directors of other previously sanctioned state-owned enterprise. 
Limited transactions necessary to wind down existing business with Belaruskali OAO are authorized until December 
8, 2021, pursuant to a general license[5] issued by OFAC. Yesterday's action also includes sanctions on individuals 
and entities involved in human rights abuses, the suppression of peaceful protestors, and the diversion of Ryanair 
flight 4978. 
Companies doing business in Belarus should closely review these developments and any dealings with the newly 
sanctioned parties or any entities majority owned by the new SDNs, which may now be prohibited. Further 
sanctions targeting state-owned enterprises, the Belarusian government, and the other sectors identified in 
yesterday's E.O. are possible.

 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko attends a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saint 
Petersburg, Russia 13 July, 2021. Sputnik/Alexei Nikolskyi/Kremlin via REUTERS 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko (pictured) struck a note of defiance on Monday (9 August) on the first 
anniversary of an election which opponents said was rigged so that he could extend his long rule, write Natalia 
Zinets and Matthias Williams. 
Lukashenko told a news conference he had won the presidential election fairly on 9 August last year, and that he 
was protecting his country against a violent uprising. 
"Today Belarus is in the focus of the attention of the whole world," he said. Last year, some people "were preparing 
for a fair election, while others were calling...for a coup d'tat." 
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in 2020 in the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's rule since he first 
became president in 1994. 
He has clung to power, and unleashed a crackdown during which his main opponents gave been jailed or have 
moved abroad. The opposition says there are more than 600 political prisoners in jail. Protests inside Belarus have 
simmered down. 
At loggerheads with Western countries that imposed sanctions on his government, Lukashenko has stayed in 
power thanks to support and financial backing from traditional ally Russia, which sees Belarus as a buffer state 
against NATO and the EU. 
Lukashenko strikes defiant note a year after contested Belarus election
Belarus was thrust into the international spotlight again last week after Belarusian sprinter Krystsina 
Tsimanouskaya refused to obey team orders to go home from the Tokyo Olympics and sought refuge in Poland. 
Read more[1]. 
Lukashenko has also tussled with the European Union since Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair flight flying 
over Belarus to land in the capital, Minsk, in May and arrested a dissident Belarusian journalist who was on board. 
Separately, EU neighbours Lithuania and Poland have accused the government in Minsk of trying to engineer a 
migrant crisis on the Belarusian border in retaliation for EU sanctions. Read more[2]. 
Lukashenko says Lithuania and Poland are to blame. 
Tens of thousands of people have been detained in Lukashenko's crackdown, described by a senior United Nations 
human rights official as a "human rights crisis". 
Belarusians living abroad held rallies against Lukashenko on Sunday in European capitals including Kyiv, London, 
Warsaw and Vilnius. 
"One year ago today, the right to freely elect their leader was taken away from the people of #Belarus. The EU 
stands firmly with you and will continue to do so," European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs EU 
summits, said in a tweet.

London Speculation of a potential capital raise sent McColl's tumbling.
In response to media reports, the convenience store chain said it was weighing up a fundraising "to increase the 
number of its Morrisons Daily store conversions, accelerate the pace of rollout of its Morrisons Daily store 
conversion programme, and strengthen its balance sheet".
Metal's group Bluejay Mining jumped after announcing a joint venture with KoBold Metals, a Bill Gates-backed 
exploration company that uses machine learning to find "deposits rich in ... materials for electric vehicles", it said.
KoBold Metals will help explore Bluejay's Disko-Nuussuaq, a project off the south-west coast of Greenland focused 
on nickel, copper, platinum and cobalt.
Esken, the aviation and energy infrastructure group, sank on news that Ryanair would cease operations based from 
a facility it owns and operates from November this year.
Commenting on the airline's move away from the London Southend airport, David Shearer, executive chair, said 
Esken was "commercially agnostic to this decision" and would "look to build sustainable and profitable passenger 
growth for LSA with a range of other carriers". Ray Douglas

 The United States will on Monday impose fresh sanctions on the regime of Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko, who is accused of a brutal crackdown on opponents, a White House official told AFP. 
President Joe Biden will sign an executive order targeting Lukashenko over an ongoing "assault against the 
democratic aspirations and human rights of the Belarusian people, transnational repression... and corruption." 
In power since 1994, Lukashenko has been cracking down on opponents since unprecedented protests erupted 
after last year's elections, deemed unfair by many observers. 
The sanctions to be imposed by the US Treasury on Monday will mark the anniversary of the elections, which the 
US official described as "fraudulent." 
At the now-completed Tokyo Olympics, Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya sought protection to avoid 
being forced onto a plane home, saying she feared for her life if she returned to Belarus after she criticized her 
coaches. 
Tsimanouskaya was among the many Belarusian sports figures who in August 2020 publicly criticized violence 
against protesters at demonstrations that gripped the ex-Soviet country after the presidential vote. 
In May, Lukashenko's government intercepted a Ryanair plane and arrested an opposition activist and his girlfriend 
on board.

"Since then, the regime has only further expanded its repression, including by threatening the safety of an Olympic 
athlete outside its borders," the US official said. 
"With today's actions, President Biden is abiding by his pledge to hold the Belarussian regime accountable for its 
abuses." 
The latest sanctions target key institutions and supporters of Lukashenko including the Belarusian National Olympic 
Committee, business leaders and companies such a private Belarusian bank. 
Also on the list is Belaruskali OAO, one of Belarus's largest state-owned enterprises and one of the world's largest 
producers of potash. It is alleged to be a source of illegal wealth for the regime. 
The US accused the National Olympic Committee of facilitating money laundering, sanctions evasion and 
circumventing visa bans. 
US To Slap New Sanctions On Belarus Regime: W.House Official
Western nations have already imposed a slew of sanctions on Lukashenko and his regime, but they appear to have 
had limited effect as he maintains backing from key ally and creditor Russia. 
Tsimanouskaya, 24, arrived in Poland on Wednesday after being granted a humanitarian visa, saying she was 
"happy to be in safety." 
According to local rights group Viasna, there are currently 603 political prisoners in Belarus. 
The US will call for an international investigation into the Ryanair flight diversion, the release of all political 
prisoners, and free and fair elections.

Ryanair to close London Southend base in mid-4Q21

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will close its base at London Southend with effect from November 1, 2021, the airport's 
owner and operator has revealed. The LCC signed a five-year agreement to base three aircraft at the airfield, 
located roughly 65 kilometres east of central London, in 2018 and commenced operations there on April 1, 2019. 
However, it scaled back the number to two aircraft - B737-800s - in 2020, following a decline in demand brought on 
by the pandemic.
In a statement, Esken, formerly known as Stobart Group, said Ryanair's schedules, load factors, and yields have 
continued to suffer significantly as a result of the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on travel demand. As such, 
following a review of its network, Ryanair has now decided to redeploy its two aircraft to its other bases so as to 
improve its own overall network efficiency with effect from the start of the winter flying season. Esken is therefore in 
talks with other carriers - low-cost and full service - to fill the capacity gap ahead of the summer 2022 season.
"The terms of the deal which had been entered into with Ryanair in 2018 were based on a significantly different set 
of market and economic parameters to the present day," David Shearer, Executive Chairman of Esken, 
commented. "We are therefore commercially agnostic to this decision and will look to build sustainable and 
profitable passenger growth for London Southend Airport with a range of other carriers as demand recovers into a 
post-pandemic world."
Ryanair is Southend's only remaining scheduled operator at present, offering flights to Alicante, Bilbao, Brest 
Guipavas, Bucharest Otopeni, Dublin Int'l, Faro, Kerkyra, Malaga, Milan Bergamo, Palma de Mallorca, and Reus. 
Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) is slated to start a 3x weekly service to Bucharest from November 1 onwards, the ch-
aviation schedules module shows.
Esken says the impact of Ryanair's departure on both its EBITDA and cash headroom in FY2022 will be negligible 
given it expects limited flying during the winter season. For FY2023, management has time to implement mitigating 
actions which include cost savings and the deferral of discretionary capital expenditure as well as attracting new 
carriers to operate the routes vacated by Ryanair. If no such actions are taken, the impact on EBITDA and cash 
headroom in FY2023 is expected to be around GBP1.4 million pounds (USD1.94 million).
Ryanair did not respond to a ch-aviation request for comment.

Esken seeks new carrier as Ryanair prepares to depart London Southend

(Alliance News) - Esken Ltd on Monday said it was in talks with replacement carriers as it seeks to compensate for 
the decision of Ryanair Holdings PLC plans to close its base at London Southend Airport.
Shares in Esken were trading down 2.7% at 15.92 pence each in London on Monday morning. Ryanair was down 
0.3% at EUR16.63.
Esken, formerly known as Stobart Group, is an infrastructure, aviation and energy company with operations in the 
UK and Ireland. It owns and operates London Southend.
Last Friday, Ryanair announced plans to close its base there on November 1. The low-cost carrier decided to 
redeploy the two aircraft currently located at London Southend to other bases, after the pandemic significantly 
affected the Dublin-based company's load factors and yields.
Esken said it expects Ryanair's decision to have a "negligible" effect on its current financial year, given expectations 
of limited flying in the upcoming winter season.
Management has time to initiate cost savings and deferral of discretionary capital expenditure ahead of the 
following period, financial 2023, the company said. 
Esken said it also plans to attract new carriers to the airport to replace Ryanair.
"The group is in active dialogue with a range of low cost and flagship carriers where the previously proven route 
profitability, the airport's efficient operating cost base and the safe passenger experience is likely to prove attractive 
as demand recovers," the company said. 
If the company takes no mitigating actions, it said Ryanair's departure would result in a hit of up to GBP1.4 million 
to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and to cash headroom in financial 2023.

The ring-fenced funding facility for the airport has adequate headroom to cover any such potential impact, Esken 
noted. Early last month, Esken secured GBP125 million in financing for Southend Airport from private equity 
investor Carlyle Group. 
"Esken remains focussed on targeting airlines for the recovery of flying in summer [2022] when demand is expected 
to show a recovery post Covid-19," the company said.
Executive Chair David Shearer added: "The fundamental commercial rationale for [London Southend Airport] 
remains strong and our partnership announced recently with Carlyle will allow us to capitalise on that opportunity as 
passenger demand recovers."

e was on the shortish side, probably in his 40s, with pale hair, eyes of ice and the steely voice of a remorselessly 
officious prig.
"All your liquids have to go into one plastic bag no larger than 20 by 20 centimetres," he said flatly, as I stood in the 
security line at Stansted airport last weekend.
I had two bags, both the wrong size, and inside one was an item the man declared he would be confiscating 
forthwith: roll-on mosquito repellent.
"But I've flown with this stuff for years!" I whined. "And where's the rule that says a bag has to be 20 by 20 
centimetres?" Behind me in the queue, I felt eyes starting to roll as people realised they were in the presence of the 
worst type of traveller: the idiot kind.
The security man was quite correct. The bag size rule has been around since at least 2006, a Google search later 
showed, and though the insect repellent rules are less clear, I should have known better.
Not having been inside an airport for nearly 18 months was no real excuse. Nor was the unsettling dread that 
another official was about to pounce on an error lurking in the fat binders of Covid paperwork needed to get on the 
plane. Nor the fear that, if I ever managed to board the rammed Ryanair flight to Spain, I would be lucky to exit 
uninfected.
Travel for work will not recover any time soon, but so what?
The whole experience left me with one overwhelming thought: if this is the future of flying, just for a summer 
holiday, business travel is going to be in trouble for quite a while.
Airline bosses predicting a "renaissance" in business trips, as Delta Air Lines' Ed Bastian did in June, may be 
comforted by the idea that vacations are optional while work journeys are essential.
But Covid has exposed a great unspoken truth about business travel: a lot of it was done for reasons that had 
nothing to do with business.
Pre-pandemic, a business trip offered the winning combination of getting out of the office and into a new place you 
always wanted to visit - or an old one whose haunts you missed.
Unfairly, work trips also allowed one to avoid domestic drudgery while enhancing one's importance. Of course you 
wanted to be home for that parentteacher night next month but alas! You had to go to a dratted business 
conference in Aspen. Or Bali. Or Barcelona and all the other destinations that once lit up a work calendar with such 
glittering promise.
If you think this sounds overly cynical, consider what 3,850 business travellers in 25 global markets told researchers 
for a survey commissioned by SAP Concur, a business that sells work travel management software.
An impressive 96 per cent were willing to return to business travel and 65 per cent were "very willing". But when 
asked to name the personal reasons for wanting to get back in a business lounge, the 54 per cent who cited a 
desire to make connections with customers and colleagues were almost matched by the 52 per cent who wanted to 
"experience new places".
In addition, 41 per cent admitted they were keen on "taking a break from their everyday life" and 19 per cent said 
they were simply looking forward to being able to dress up and go somewhere.
I do not blame them. And while Covid has shown how much of working life can be done easily, and cheaply, on a 
screen, business travel will never disappear completely.
Clearly it is better to turn up in person to, say, inspect a factory building before your company buys it, or persuade a 
client to sign a big contract with your firm instead of a hungry new rival.
Personally, I cannot wait to interview people face-to-face in their natural environments again, rather than over a 
screen.
But I also know that, before 2020, I would have thought it impossible to go through anything like an initial public 
offering from home on Zoom. Then I met the founder of a British company who has just done precisely that - very 
successfully.
The pandemic has a habit of turning predictions to dust, but if business travel recovers to anything like what it was 
any time soon, I will be seriously surprised.

 The United States will on Monday impose fresh sanctions on the regime of Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko, who is accused of a brutal crackdown on opponents, a White House official told AFP. 
 President Joe Biden will sign an executive order targeting Lukashenko over an ongoing 'assault against the 
democratic aspirations and human rights of the Belarusian people, transnational repression and corruption.' 
 In power since 1994, Lukashenko has been cracking down on opponents since unprecedented protests erupted 
after last year's elections, deemed unfair by many observers. 
 The sanctions to be imposed by the US Treasury on Monday will mark the anniversary of the elections, which the 
US official described as 'fraudulent.' 
 At the now-completed Tokyo Olympics, Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya sought protection to avoid 
being forced onto a plane home, saying she feared for her life if she returned to Belarus after she criticized her 
coaches. 
 Tsimanouskaya was among the many Belarusian sports figures who in August 2020 publicly criticized violence 
against protesters at demonstrations that gripped the ex-Soviet country after the presidential vote. 
 In May, Lukashenko's government intercepted a Ryanair plane and arrested an opposition activist and his girlfriend 
on board. 
- Olympic threats - 
'Since then, the regime has only further expanded its repression, including by threatening the safety of an Olympic 
athlete outside its borders,' the US official said. 
 'With today's actions, President Biden is abiding by his pledge to hold the Belarussian regime accountable for its 
abuses.' 
 The latest sanctions target key institutions and supporters of Lukashenko including the Belarusian National 
Olympic Committee, business leaders and companies such a private Belarusian bank. 
 Also on the list is Belaruskali OAO, one of Belarus's largest state-owned enterprises and one of the world's largest 
producers of potash. It is alleged to be a source of illegal wealth for the regime. 
US to slap new sanctions on Belarus regime: W.House official
 The US accused the National Olympic Committee of facilitating money laundering, sanctions evasion and 
circumventing visa bans. 
 Western nations have already imposed a slew of sanctions on Lukashenko and his regime, but they appear to 
have had limited effect as he maintains backing from key ally and creditor Russia. 
 Tsimanouskaya, 24, arrived in Poland on Wednesday after being granted a humanitarian visa, saying she was 
'happy to be in safety.' 
 According to local rights group Viasna, there are currently 603 political prisoners in Belarus. 
 The US will call for an international investigation into the Ryanair flight diversion, the release of all political 
prisoners, and free and fair elections.

 The U.S.[1], U.K.[2] and Canada[3] imposed an array of new sanctions against Belarus on Monday, the first 
anniversary of a fraudulent election[4] that triggered a national protest movement and a brutal crackdown by the 
country's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko. 
Why it matters: Previous Western sanctions have so far done little to influence Lukashenko's behavior as he clings 
to power — with the support of Russian President Vladimir Putin — by jailing his political opponents[5], arresting 
journalists[6] and publicly attacking[7] those who criticize his regime. The new sanctions target the country's potash, 
oil and tobacco exports, its defense, transportation and construction sectors, and several prominent business 
leaders. The sanctions are designed to increase pressure on Lukashenko's regime while reducing consequences 
for Belarus's wider population. What they're saying: "Rather than respect the clear will of the Belarusian people, the 
Lukashenka regime perpetrated election fraud, followed by a brutal campaign of repression to stifle dissent," 
President Biden said in a statement. "From detaining thousands of peaceful protesters, to imprisoning more than 
500 activists, civil society leaders, and journalists as political prisoners, to forcing the diversion of an international 
flight in an affront to global norms, the actions of the Lukashenka regime are an illegitimate effort to hold on to 
power at any price," he added. The other side: "You are America's lapdogs," a furious Lukashenko responded on 
Monday when asked about the U.K.'s sanctions, telling London they can "choke on them," according to Reuters[8]. 
The big picture: U.S. and several other countries no longer recognize Lukashenko as the legitimate president of 
Belarus following the blatantly rigged election, in which he claimed to have won a landslide victory over pro-
democracy opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Lukashenko maintains that he won the election fairly and 
that his crackdown on opposition is his attempt to defend Belarus against a plotted coup, according to 
Reuters[9].His security forces have detained hundreds of protesters and opposition activists. In May, Belarusian 
agents were accused[10] of calling in a fake bomb threat to divert a Ryanair plane carrying an opposition activist, 
who was subsequently arrested.Lukashenko's regime received widespread criticism during the Tokyo Olympics 
when Belarusian sprinter said she feared for her safety[11] after she was ordered to return home following her 
criticism of Belarusian coaches. She defected and received asylum in Poland[12]. Biden met in July with 
Tsikhanouskaya[13], who was forced to flee to Lithuania after the post-election crackdown last year. During their 
meeting, Tsikhanouskaya gave the president a list of targets that she believed should be sanctioned, according to 
U.S. , U.K. and Canada impose new sanctions on Belarus on anniversary of rigged election
CNN[14]. "We appreciate the decision of [the U.S.] to expand sanctions against Lukashenka's regime," 
Tsikhanouskaya tweeted[15] Monday."Though sanctions are not a silver bullet, they are designed to push the 
regime towards dialogue and stop its impunity. Thankful to the US for the principled position and support of 
Belarusians." August 9, 2021. 1 stolen presidential election in Belarus. Millions of votes for changes. 365 days of 
peaceful protests. 610 polit. prisoners. Thousands are imprisoned on polit. grounds. 36,000 came through

 Ryanair (RYA.L) decided to shut its base at London Southend Airport, owned and operated by UK's Esken 
(ESKN.L), at the start of the winter season, according to an Aug. 6 filing.
The British low-cost carrier previously entered into a five-year deal to base three aircraft at the airport, starting April 
1, 2019. However, the airline's performance at London Southend was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
resulting in Ryanair pulling out from the airport.
Meanwhile, Esken said the financial impact of the closure is expected to be mitigated by a consequent reduction in 
costs and low level of passengers during the winter season. 
Ryanair's stock lost over 2% on Aug. 6's close, while Esken lost over 1%.

Lukashenko threatened with new EU sanction on re-election anniversary
Lukashenko threatened with new EU sanction on re-election anniversary

On the eve of the anniversary of his re-election, widely believed to have been rigged, Belarusian ruler Alexander 
Lukashenko was threatened by the European Union with additional sanctions.
"The EU stands ready to consider further measures in light of the regime's blatant disregard of international 
commitments," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday.
With the "forced and unlawful" landing of a Ryanair flight in May and the instrumentalization of migrants for political 
purposes, the regime has "further challenged international norms," Borrell added.
Borrell was alluding, among other things, to the fact that more than 2,000 illegal crossings were registered at the 
border of EU member Lithuania with Belarus in July alone.
From the EU's point of view, this is being done deliberately by the government in Minsk. Lukashenko had openly 
threatened to allow people from countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria to cross the border in response to the 
EU sanctions.
The EU statement was published on the anniversary of the presidential election in Belarus on August 9 last year. 
Lukashenko was declared the winner despite massive accusations of electoral fraud.
Mass protests following the elections were put down with violence.
The EU has already imposed sanctions in recent months due to the repression of civil society and the democratic 
opposition in Belarus.
Most recently, there were also economic sanctions following the arrest of the anti-government blogger Roman 
Protasevich.

Authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius in Lithuania to make a

Lukashenko's opponent Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claims victory in the August 2020 election, again called for 
greater pressure on Minsk.
"At the moment, nobody can feel safe, including me," the 38-year-old, who now lives in exile in Lithuania, told dpa. 
She mentioned the case of Belarusian activist Vitaly Shishov, who was recently found dead in Ukraine, where he 
lived in exile.
The situation of Belarusian Olympic athlete Kristina Timanovskaya also showed that anyone could be a victim of 
Lukashenko's "repressive apparatus".
The track and field athlete fled to Poland after she said she was to be kidnapped from the Tokyo Olympics for 
criticizing Belarusian sports officials.

Lukashenko threatened with new EU sanction on re-election anniversary
Lukashenko threatened with new EU sanction on re-election anniversary

On the eve of the anniversary of his re-election, widely believed to have been rigged, Belarusian ruler Alexander 
Lukashenko was threatened by the European Union with additional sanctions.
"The EU stands ready to consider further measures in light of the regime's blatant disregard of international 
commitments," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday.
With the "forced and unlawful" landing of a Ryanair flight in May and the instrumentalization of migrants for political 
purposes, the regime has "further challenged international norms," Borrell added.
Borrell was alluding, among other things, to the fact that more than 2,000 illegal crossings were registered at the 
border of EU member Lithuania with Belarus in July alone.
From the EU's point of view, this is being done deliberately by the government in Minsk. Lukashenko had openly 
threatened to allow people from countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria to cross the border in response to the 
EU sanctions.
The EU statement was published on the anniversary of the presidential election in Belarus on August 9 last year.
Lukashenko was declared the winner with 80.1 per cent of the votes despite massive accusations of electoral fraud.
Mass protests following the elections were put down with violence.
The EU no longer recognizes Lukashenko as president and has already imposed sanctions in recent months due to 
the repression of civil society and the democratic opposition in Belarus.
Lukashenko threatened with new EU sanction on re-election anniversary
Most recently, there were also economic sanctions following the arrest of the anti-government blogger Roman 
Protasevich.
Authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius in Lithuania to make a 
stopover in Minsk in order to arrest the Lukashenko critic.
Lukashenko's opponent Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claims victory in the August 2020 election, again called for 
greater pressure on Minsk.
"At the moment, nobody can feel safe, including me," the 38-year-old, who now lives in exile in Lithuania, told dpa. 
She mentioned the case of Belarusian activist Vitaly Shishov, who was recently found dead in Ukraine, where he 
lived in exile.
The situation of Belarusian Olympic athlete Kristina Timanovskaya also showed that anyone could be a victim of 
Lukashenko's "repressive apparatus."
The track and field athlete fled to Poland after she said she was to be kidnapped from the Tokyo Olympics for 
criticizing Belarusian sports officials. 
Later on Sunday, the German foreign minister pledged to support the country's democracy movement.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the whole country was being held "hostage" by Lukashenko, according to a 
ministry statement.
"Alongside political support, we have launched practical assistance with our Belarus civil society action plan to 
support people who are being politically persecuted," he said.
Maas called the anniversary a "turning point in Belarusian history" with regard to the anniversary.
"Led by courageous women like Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and Maria Kolesnikova, people walked, and still walk, the 
streets of the country peacefully protesting against state violence."
Kolesnikova, an opposition activist who had worked as a cultural manager in Stuttgart for many years, is now a 
political prisoner, jailed alongside more than 600 other government critics.
"Their protest, their will to persevere is met with admiration, solidarity and support worldwide," Maas said.
He repeated criticism that peaceful citizens were being tortured and driven into exile, and stressed that Lukashenko 
had lost any political or moral legitimacy.
"Germany and the European Union stand by the people of Belarus who are fighting for respect for fundamental 
democratic and human rights values."

The Ambassador of the European Union to Iraq, Martin Huth, told the Lithuanian newspaper 15min and the news 
agency Baltic News Service on the evening of August 4 that he had received "positive signals" that flights from Iraq 
to Minsk National would be suspended for the next ten days due to attempts by Lithuania and the EU to cope with a 
surge in illegal migration via Belarus.
"We received information from several sources that flights have been cancelled for the next ten days. This seems to 
be very reliable information. As far as we understand, Iraqi Airways (IA, Baghdad) has informed all travel agencies 
in the country about this," he said.
On August 5, a scheduled flight due to be operated from Basrah to Minsk by the state-owned flag carrier was 
indeed cancelled Flightradar24 ADS-B data shows. However, a flight on the same day from Baghdad to Minsk 
courtesy of privately owned Fly Baghdad (IF, Baghdad) operated as planned.
Flightradar24 shows that Fly Baghdad has been operating ad hoc flights between the two capital cities, while Iraqi 
Airways has been flying to Minsk from Baghdad, Basrah, Erbil, and Sulaymaniyah.
Also on August 5, Iraq's Ministry of Transport confirmed in a statement, released through the National Iraqi News 
Agency, that Iraqi Airways had suspended its flights to Minsk as of the same day.
More than 4,000 people, mostly from Iraq, have crossed the border illegally from Belarus into EU member Lithuania 
so far this year. Lithuanian officials believe that the swelling migration flows have been organised by the regime of 
Belarus' president, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, in retaliation for Vilnius' support for the 2020-2021 Belarusian protests 
and its vocal condemnation of the forced diversion in May of a Ryanair flight to Vilnius from Athens Int'l by the 
authorities in Minsk.
The EU has been in talks with Baghdad to return Iraqis who have recently crossed the Belarus-Lithuania border and 
are currently being held in a camp near Vilnius. Huth said that the Iraqi government had formed a committee to 
investigate the possible smuggling of Iraqi migrants into Lithuania via Belarus.
Iraq does not have an embassy in Vilnius, but on August 4, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that its 
embassy in Moscow "is closely following information about an incident in which an Iraqi citizen was killed at the 
border between Belarus and Lithuania." It is believed that this incident, which officials in Lithuania and Belarus have 
Iraqi Airways suspends flights to Minsk amid migrant crisis
blamed on each other, could be behind the temporary reduction in flights to Minsk. The ministry has urged Iraqis not 
to become targets of human trafficking and smuggling networks.
Gitanas Nauseda, president of Lithuania, told 15min: "At this point, I say only this: we are ready to talk to both 
countries of origin and transit, but we must be ready for such negotiations because otherwise the results can be 
disappointing and there is no need to look far for examples."
On August 5, Belarus' state-run news agency BelTA reported that Lukashenka had closed the country's land border 
with Lithuania altogether, without giving any indication as to when it could be reopened. "As of today, no one will be 
allowed to cross the border from anywhere, neither from the south nor from the west," the president said.

Esken Ltd - London Southend airport operator - Notes Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC has stated its intention to 
close its base at London Southend Airport with effect from the start of the winter season this year. As a result, 
Ryanair will cease operations based from London Southend Airport from November 1.
"Esken is currently in the process of reviewing the impact of such decision on its forecasts. However, the financial 
impact of Ryanair's base closure will be mitigated by a reduction in costs directly associated with serving Ryanair's 
base and the low level of passengers expected during the winter season," it says.

Britons on holiday in Mexico were scrambling to find a return flight before Sunday after the Central American 
country was upgraded to red status in the latest review of the traffic light system.
Airline and travel shares perked up a little on the news, though analysts said that except for Mexico the changes 
had been well flagged.
Red list status means that visitors returning to the UK have to quarantine in a government-run hotel for ten days at 
a cost of £1,750.
Some holidaymakers only found out about the change in status on arriving in Mexico today and have said they had 
spent today looking for a flight back to the UK.
In addition to Mexico, Georgia and French territories of  La Reunion and Mayotte were also upgraded to red.
Going the other way were India, Bahrain, Qatar and UAE, which were downgraded to red from amber. France was 
also downgraded to amber from Amber Plus, also meaning that people who had two vaccine jabs don't have to self-
isolate on return to the UK.
Additions to the Green List, which means there is no requirement to quarantine, are Austria, Germany, Latvia, 
Norway, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.
Liberum said: "Although the direction of travel is generally one of relaxation of restrictions, these changes offer little 
material help to airlines and come relatively late in the peak travel season."

Lufthansa to report on difficult second quarter
Lufthansa to report on difficult second quarter
dpa international (Englischer Dienst)

Dateline: Frankfurt (dpa) - 
Body
German airline Lufthansa is due to report on Thursday on its business in the second quarter, which continued to be 
strongly influenced by the coronavirus pandemic.
Lufthansa planes continue to take off far less frequently and with fewer passengers than before the crisis began.
The continuing ban on EU citizens entering the US is particularly painful. New losses are likely unavoidable for 
Lufthansa in the second quarter.
According to an evaluation by the air safety organization Eurocontrol, Lufthansa was able to increase the number of 
its flights recently, but in the last week of July it was still 46 per cent behind the same week of 2019.
Other airlines such as Ireland's Ryanair, down 17 per cent on the year, or the direct competitor Air France, down 25 
per cent, were already much more present in the skies again.
In the first quarter, the state-backed and highly indebted MDax group had flown in another loss of 1.05 billion euros 
(1.24 billion dollars) after the record loss of 6.7 billion euros in the first coronavirus year 2020.
Chief executive Carsten Spohr and the rest of the management are therefore focused primarily on liquidity, which 
was 10.6 billion euros at the end of March, in part thanks to various tranches of state aid.
According to the company, the main priority of raising 5.5 billion euros of new equity, a move shareholders have 
now approved, is to repay state investments in the company.

UK relaxes quarantine rules for travellers from France

Highlight: The Government of the UK has eased quarantine rules for fully vaccinated people visiting England from 
France.
Body
Fully vaccinated travellers from France can now skip the ten-day isolation rule. Last month, the UK Government 
reportedly planned to lift quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers coming from the EU and the US. 
From 2 August, the ten-day quarantine requirement after arriving in England was lifted for travellers fully vaccinated 
with the US and EU-approved vaccines. However, France arrivals were previously excluded from this rule. In 
addition to France, the UK has now also added six other European nations, including Germany, to the Green list. 
Passengers arriving from these countries can avoid quarantine, even if they are not fully vaccinated. Furthermore, 
the UK has eased restrictions for passengers arriving from countries including India, Bahrain, the UAE and Qatar. 
These countries, which were previously on the country's red list, were moved to the amber list. All these changes 
will come into effect on 8 August 2021. The announcement by the government is expected to help airlines and 
tourism companies in the country, which were hit hard by the pandemic. In June, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) 
in the UK reportedly teamed up with Irish airline company Ryanair to launch a legal action against the government 
over the travel traffic light system. The UK Government introduced the traffic light system, which rates countries 
green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. The litigation was also supported by British Airways owner IAG, TUI, 
Easyjet and Virgin Atlantic. By launching a legal challenge, the companies sought more transparency on how the 
countries are being classified. However, the High Court ruled in favour of the government.

Sun-seekers enjoy European summer 'workcation' before office return
Sun-seekers enjoy European summer 'workcation' before office return

Aug 05, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 Drawn by sun, sea and speedy Wi-Fi, remote workers are converging on Europe's southernmost islands to try 
"workcationing" before employers order them back to the office, giving battered tourism businesses a welcome 
boon, write Clara-laeila Laudette and Corina Pons. 
Olga Paul, 34, came to the Spanish island of Gran Canaria in May to work remotely for the first time, after long 
pandemic months cooped up in her flat in Munich, where she is a business analyst for one of Germany's largest car 
manufacturers. 
"I think I'm more productive now," she said, delighted with the sea view from her rooftop, where she goes for 
breaks. "I can concentrate on my work and explore the islands on the weekends ... it feels great." 
Combining holiday destinations with remote work is a growing trend in Spain and Portugal's sunniest archipelagos, 
as travel bans ease and the starved tourism industry offers discounted stays and dedicated workspaces. 
"We have certainly seen a growth in the 'Digital Nomads' category, (which) has been important to the tourism sector 
during the pandemic since it contributed to long-term stays and local economies," said Jennifer Iduh, head of 
research at the European Union's tourism body. 
The remote workers register as tourists, making them hard to quantify, but evidence of their presence is ubiquitous, 
from new co-working spaces sprouting up to stickers advertising free, extra-powerful Wi-Fi in many restaurants, 
cafes and bars. 
However, the influx is but slight relief to the tourism-reliant islands: Spain's first half arrivals were still just a third of 
the 10 million in the same period of 2019. 
Still, local associations in the Canary Islands or Portugal's Madeira said the number of people coming to work 
remotely surged, even in the more expensive peak season. 
Sun-seekers enjoy European summer 'workcation' before office return
The "Nomad List" website counted the Canary island of Tenerife among the 10 fastest-growing destinations for 
teleworking in the first seven months of 2021, after the trend began last year. 
"By (last) summer, I could see more and more people starting to come, not for holidays or living permanently but to 
work for six weeks, two months, three months," said Nele Boesmans, a Belgian native living in Fuerteventura, the 
second largest of the Canary Islands. 
Membership of the "Digital Nomads Fuerteventura" Facebook group Boesmans runs quintupled during the 
pandemic. 
Airlines and rental websites said bookings from mainland Europe, which ticked up last summer, are shooting up 
now. 
Flights to the Canary Islands were up 88% between April and July of this year versus the same period in 2020, low-
cost carrier Ryanair said, while bookings for Tenerife doubled. 
The trend should continue, a Ryanair spokeswoman said, noting that June sales of one-way tickets to the Canaries 
were 32% up on May and 74% up on June 2020. 
Rental requests for over 15 days in the Canary, Balearic and Madeira islands grew 51% last summer, according to 
property portal Idealista, which forecast bookings would keep the pace in 2021. 
"I call them corporate nomads," said Ignacio Rodriguez, who presides a Canary Islands association of co-working 
spaces and saw a particular boom in temporary teleworkers, most from France. 
Around 8,000 remote workers have come in the first half of this year, the Canaries' tourism office estimated, with an 
additional 30,000 expected in the next 5 years. 
In Madeira, authorities created an office to advise remote workers, expecting 500 requests - but receiving 8,000 
since February. 
"Hotel managers didn't know about remote workers but now the word is so common for them," said Micaela Vieira, 
manager of Madeira's "Digital Nomad" project. 
In windswept Fuerteventura's north, local council La Oliva ran a campaign so effective that the tiny fishing village of 
El Cotillo received enough remote workers to justify a new co-working space called COCO. 
Italian-Colombian surfer Matteo Leoni created COCO after noticing a tourism influx neither he nor El Cotillo's slow-
living locals had ever seen. 
"They were people aged 25-45, working remotely, coming from Madrid, Paris, Rome, Milan, who'd thought, 'Why 
not work somewhere warmer?,'" Leoni said. "In the Canaries, there's so much space that social distancing is a 
given." 
COCO will open in mid-September, with Leoni hoping 8-10 permanent subscribers will enjoy its relaxation zones, 
garden, cafe and acoustically-isolated cabins. 
Spanish airline Iberia launched a 10% discount for those keen to make the most of remote working's possible final 
months from a temporary perch in the Canary Islands. 
Sun-seekers enjoy European summer 'workcation' before office return
Hotel chains Melia and Vincci are offering discounted package deals for remote workers looking to stay several 
weeks, with Melia's campaign called "Work in Heaven." 
"Since (Spain's) state of emergency ended and mobility between regions began, the service is in higher demand," 
Vincci said in an email. 
Croatia and Greece also jumped on the bandwagon, developing special visas for sun-starved remote workers, with 
Croatia touting its idyllic landscapes as "Your new office" in its promotional campaign. read more[1] 
And around 3,500 people have registered for Dubai's "Virtual Working" programme this year, mainly British, U.S. 
and Indian visitors, said Issam Kazim, director general of Dubai's Tourism and Commerce Corporation. Read 
more[2]. 
"Dubai's average occupancy in 1-5 star properties is approaching 60% ... strongly supported by apartments ... 
suggesting people are looking for long-term options, in line with choosing to work from here," Kazim added. 
Whether the trend survives this autumn's sweep of back-to-office mandates is another question, especially given 
the success of vaccination campaigns in some regions. 
Some, though, hope to return to the islands - or maybe just stay. 
"Everybody who I met trying it absolutely loves it," said Alexander Swanton, a U.S. freelance screenwriter who surfs 
in his spare time in Gran Canaria, where he settled after leaving an insurance job last October. 
Nor is Joao Santos ready to relinquish his after-work beach trips. "I'm not going to be forced back into an office 
anytime soon," vowed the Portuguese web developer working remotely for the first time in Madeira.

 In the past week, SkyWest SKYW[1] reported better-than-expected earnings per share for second-quarter 2021 as 
air-travel demand improves in the United States. Latin American carriers like Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[2] 
and Copa Holdings CPA[3] reported narrower-than-expected loss for the June quarter as air-travel demand gains 
momentum in South America too owing to ramped-up vaccination. U.S. carriers like American Airlines AAL[4] and 
Southwest Airlines LUV[5] incurred a loss in the second quarter as was reported in the previous week's write up[6]. 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[7] July traffic was impressive as wide-spread vaccination in 
addition to the relaxation of restrictions in the EU led to an uptick in air-travel. Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1 SkyWest, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported second-quarter 2021 
earnings of $1.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents. Quarterly earnings also came 
against the year ago loss of 51 cents. Revenues in the June quarter summed $657 million, not only surpassing the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $581.5 million but also increasing 87.7% year over year. Passenger load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased 42 percentage points to 76.4% in the June quarter owing to 
the uptick in air-travel demand[8].

2021, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.22. Net operating revenues of $194.1 million 
surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $188.2 million. The top line surged more than 100% year over year 
with passenger revenues (accounting for 86.3% of total revenues) rising more than 200%, thanks to improvement in 
air-travel demand due to easing coronavirus-led restrictions. Cargo and other revenues improved 23%[10]. 
3. Copa Holdingsincurred a loss (excluding $1.04 from non-recurring items) of 38 cents per share in the second 
quarter of 2021, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.08. In the year-ago period, the 
company reported loss of $2.70. This was the fifth successive quarterly loss incurred by the carrier. Results were 
hurt by the coronavirus-induced limited flight operations. The company's flight operations were only 48% of 2019 
(pre-pandemic) level in the quarter. 
Quarterly revenues of $304.3 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $268.4 million and rose 3.5% 
year over year. Management stated that the June quarter was the first period since the onset of the pandemic when

capacity to reach 4.5 billion in the third quarter of 2021. This represents around 70% of the third-quarter 2019 
levels. 
The company anticipates total revenues of $415 million in the quarter, accounting for 58% of the third-quarter 2019 
revenues.

guests a year-ago. The carrier's load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in the month was 80%, up from June's 
72%. Also, in the same period, Ryanair operated in excess of 61,000 flights. 
5. In a bid to expand its footprint in South America, American Airlines inked a letter of intent with ultra-low-cost 
carrier JetSMART. The former intends to acquire a minority stake in the latter. The proposed codeshare agreement 
between the two carriers aims to boost connectivity between the United States and South America and widen travel 
options for passengers. Travelers will be able to earn and redeem AAdvantage miles on JetSMART flights provided 
the deal materializes. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over

 Belarusian Olympic athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya arrived at a Japanese airport on Wednesday where she is 
expected to board a plane to Poland, after Warsaw offered the sprinter a humanitarian visa. 
The 24-year-old, who was seen leaving a car and entering Narita airport, has said her team tried to force her to 
return home after she criticised her coaches. 
The sprinter declined to speak to the media as she entered the airport. 
Tsimanouskaya has said she fears for her life if she returns to Belarus, where there has been political upheaval and 
a crackdown on dissent after disputed elections that returned strongman Alexander Lukashenko to power last year. 
She was one of more than 2,000 Belarusian sports figures who signed an open letter calling for new elections and 
for political prisoners to be freed. 
Her husband has now fled to Ukraine and the pair are expected to meet up in Poland, which is a staunch critic of 
Lukashenko's regime and has become home to a growing number of dissidents. 
Tsimanouskaya arrived in Poland's embassy on Monday evening following a night spent in an airport hotel after she 
sought help to avoid what she said was an attempt by her team to forcibly return her home.

 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Tuesday he had spoken to the "courageous" Tsimanouskaya, who 
is "currently well taken care of and safe". 
"I assured her that she can count on the support and solidarity of Poland. In the coming days, she will fly to 
Warsaw, where she will be able to thrive without obstacles and, if she so chooses, will receive further assistance," 
he wrote on Facebook. 
The International Olympic Committee has said it will investigate Belarus's Olympic team over the incident, but 
activists have called for the country's Olympic committee to be suspended and its athletes to compete as neutrals. 
And US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Belarus of "another act of transnational repression" over the 
alleged attempt to force Tsimanouskaya home. 
Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, sparked international outrage in May by dispatching a fighter jet to 
intercept a Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania in order to arrest a dissident onboard. 
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski seemed to reference that incident when he declined to confirm 
whether Tsimanouskaya would fly out on Wednesday as had been rumoured, citing safety.

The Olympic saga came as police in Ukraine said a missing Belarusian activist, whose NGO helps his compatriots 
flee the country, had been found hanged in a park in Kiev. 
Police said they had opened a murder probe and would pursue all leads including "murder disguised as suicide".

Lukashenko's Belarus is a full-blown rogue regime West should heed opposition calls to extend and tighten

The "defection" of the Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya is something that seems easier to imagine at 
the Tokyo Olympics of 1964 than at a Games being held in 2021. Hours after she took refuge in the Polish 
embassy, a Belarusian activist, Vitali Shishov, was found hanged in a Kyiv park; his death is being investigated as a 
potential murder. If it was indeed a political hit, then this week's events - after May's effective state hijacking of a 
Ryanair flight to seize another opposition activist - highlight how Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko has 
created a rogue regime at the heart of Europe.
The Tsimanouskaya case harks back to Soviet times. The 24-year-old sprinter complained on social media that 
coaches entered her for a relay she did not train for, as other Belarusian athletes had not completed enough anti-
doping tests to compete (the circumstances of which ought to be investigated). After team bosses tried to put her on 
a flight home because of what they called her "emotional, psychological state", she was given protection by Tokyo 
police and offered a humanitarian visa by Warsaw.
There are echoes, too, of other strongman regimes: the president of the Belarus Olympic Committee is Viktor 
Lukashenko, the dictator's son and presumptive heir - rather as Saddam Hussein's son Uday once headed Iraq's 
Olympic and football associations. The International Olympic Committee barred both Lukashenkos from Tokyo, 
after Belarusian athletes accused Minsk authorities of political discrimination and imprisonment. Athletes were 
prominent in the protests that erupted after Lukashenko claimed what was seen as a fraudulent election victory, a 
year ago next week.
Lukashenko's Belarus is a full-blown rogue regime West should heed opposition calls to extend and tighten 
sanctions
Up to 35,000 Belarusians have since been arrested. Allegations of torture are rife. Many young people are 
emigrating.
Vitali Shishov, who went missing while running in Kyiv on Monday, headed the so-called Belarusian House in 
Ukraine, which helps émigrés fleeing persecution. Friends said Shishov was recently followed. So was the activist 
Roman Protasevich, before boarding the flight from Greece to his home in exile of Lithuania, which was diverted to 
Minsk by a bogus bomb scare.
The opposition clampdown betrays mounting paranoia on Lukashenko's part. Critics say western sanctions only 
drive him into Russian president Vladimir Putin's arms, while leaving
Belarusians worse off. But Lukashenko has spent years playing Brussels off against Moscow, while only tightening 
his hold on power. Western countries can no longer tolerate his mistreatment of his own people and flouting of the 
law, at home and abroad. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who many Belarusians believe was the real winner of last 
year's election, has spent recent days urging Washington and London to tighten sanctions.
They should pay heed. The EU is to be commended for going further than the US and the UK in imposing sanctions 
not just on individuals, but sectoral measures that ban imports of Belarusian oil products and potash sales - among 
the country's most lucrative exports. It also restricted issuance in the EU of new debt with a longer than 90- day 
maturity for the Minsk government and some state-controlled groups.
But several loopholes which limit the effect of the EU potash ban need to be removed. As they did over Russia's 
intervention in Ukraine, the US and UK should also impose sectoral measures on Belarus. Three decades after the 
Berlin Wall fell, the Belarus regime looks like a historical anomaly. Its people deserve western solidarity in pressing 
Lukashenko finally to heed the message voters sent him a year ago.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) said that passenger numbers have doubled in July as the travel industry begins 
to recover.
The budget carrier flew 9.3mln people last month, across over 61,000 flights, compared to 4.4mln in July 2020.

The load factor rose to 80% from 72% in July, which analysts at Liberum noted was the strongest since the start of 
the pandemic.
"Ryanair has operated more capacity than we expected and will inevitably have used low fares to stimulate 
demand, which has also benefited from the roll-out of EU Covid certificates," fellow broker Peel Hunt commented.
"We expect a further increase in passenger volumes and load factor in August as travel restrictions are gradually 
eased and customers become more accustomed to travel requirements for certificates and testing."
Shares were flat at (EURO)16.64 on Wednesday morning.

       U.K. stocks rose on Wednesday even as new data showed the recovery of the country's services sector slowed 
in July alongside record inflationary pressures.

The figure indicated an increase in activity for the fifth month running.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 inched up 28 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,134 after gaining 0.3 percent on Tuesday.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said passenger numbers more than doubled in July 
following the roll-out of EU Covid certificates.
The budget airline carried 9.3 million passengers, up from 4.4 million a year ago. Compared to June, passenger 
numbers increased by 75% from 5.3 million. 
The load factor, measuring how many seats on planes are filled, was 80% in July. That's up from the 72% achieved 
in both June and in July 2020. 
The Dublin-based carrier cited the EU Covid certificate scheme, which was rolled out on July 1. This allows those 
who have either been vaccinated, tested negative, or recovered from the disease to travel within the bloc. 
On Tuesday, smaller rival Wizz Air Holdings PLC said July passenger numbers increased 62% year-on-year and 
90% month-on-month, with a load factor of 79%. 
Ryanair shares were down 0.1% at EUR16.64 in London on Wednesday morning.

Airlines and travel companies will know the next round of changes to the UK government's traffic light system on 
Thursday, ministers confirmed today.
Boris Johnson has also scrapped a proposed change to the system that would have seen an amber watchlist set up 
after from the industry, chancellor Rishi Sunak and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.
Industry figures were concerned that the amber watchlist would have stalled any recovery in summer travel.
Countries on the list would have been at risk of being moved up to the red list, which requires anyone coming back 
to the UK from a visit to quarantine in a hotel for ten days at a cost of £1,750.
Concern has been growing that the visitors to places such as Spain, Greece and Italy might bring the Delta variant 
back to the UK.
Spain has been widely reported as a candidate to be moved on to the amber plus list alongside France due to a rise 
in the number of Beta variant cases.
These cases though are being overshadowed by a rise in the more infectious Delta variant, and these are an 
ongoing concern for the UK government said Boris Johnson.
 "On travel, we have had to balance it because of the anxiety that I think a lot of people have - I have - about 
importing new variants, bringing back the disease."
France is being tipped to be downgraded to amber again in Thursday's review, after a decline in Beta variant cases.
Green list changes to be announced on Thursday, UK government confirms
That will mean people who have had two vaccination jabs will not have to self-isolate if they come back from holiday 
in France, though they will still have to take Covid-19 tests.
Shares in British Airways owner IAG dropped 0.7% to 172.24p, EasyJet PLC fell 1.6% to 832.8p though Ryanair 
rose 0.4% to (EURO)16.84.

Ryanair challenges (EURO)650mn Polish state aid to LOT

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has lodged another complaint at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) 
against airlines across the continent receiving state aid, this time targetting the EUR650 billion euros (USD772 
million) in public funds that LOT Polish Airlines (LO, Warsaw Chopin) has received, Puls Biznesu and Gazeta 
Wyborcza reported.
The Irish carrier has so far challenged aid to 20 airlines, which it says have received a total of EUR30 billion 
(USD35.7 million). The European Commission approved the sum to LOT in December, to compensate it for losses 
suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The aid will consist of a EUR400 million (USD475 million) subsidised loan granted by the state-owned Polish 
Development Fund (Polski Fundusz Rozwoju) and a capital injection of EUR250 million (USD297 million) through 
newly minted shares taken up by the Polish treasury.
"We appealed against the decision in the LOT case to the CJEU at the beginning of July. The case is pending. The 
next step is the response of the European Commission and probably the intervention of Poland that supports it. I 
suspect that the trial will not take place until 2022," Juliusz Komorek, Ryanair's chief legal and regulatory officer, 
told Puls Biznesu.
LOT spokesman Krzysztof Moczulski countered: "Ryanair accuses the European Commission of, among other 
things, the misapplication of state aid rules, including recapitalisation as a support measure, instead of other less 
market-distorting methods. It should be noted, however, that before issuing its decision, the commission analysed 
the LOT case in detail, the conditions of the assistance provided, its necessity, and how appropriate the forms of 
support accepted are."
LOT Polish Airlines posted a net loss of over PLN1 billion zloty (USD260 million) for 2020 as passenger numbers 
plunged from almost 10.5 million in 2019 to three million in 2020, disrupting the plans it had to expand that year and 
beyond.
LOT and Ryanair did not immediately respond to ch-aviation's request for comment.

 A Belarusian activist who heads an NGO helping his compatriots flee repression in Belarus has disappeared in 
Kiev, his organisation said on Telegram. 
Vitali Shishov, head of the Belarusian House in Ukraine, went jogging in Kiev on Monday morning but did not return 
and could not be reached on his mobile phone, the organisation said. 
Friends of Shishov said he had been followed by "strangers" while jogging recently, human rights organisation 
Vyasna said on Telegram. 
Police and volunteers had mounted a search of the area where he went running but had failed to locate him, 
Belarusian House said. 
Many Belarusians have fled, often to neighbouring Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania, as President Alexander 
Lukashenko's regime has cracked down on any form of dissent since mass protests erupted after disputed 
elections last year.

Lukashenko has ruled the former Soviet republic with an iron fist since 1994. 
Shishov's disappearance comes as Belarusian athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya said she was forced to withdraw 
from the Tokyo Olympics and threatened with forced repatriation for criticising her athletics federation on social 
media. 
 The sprinter, who was granted a humanitarian visa by Poland on Monday, said she feared being jailed if she 
returned to her country, where the authorities have targeted the president's opponents, rights activists and 
journalists. 
Her husband Arseny Zdanevich told AFP he had fled from Belarus to Ukraine and was hoping to join his wife "in the 
near future". 
Lukashenko and his son Viktor have been banned from Olympic events over the targeting of athletes for their 
political views. 
Lukashenko sparked international outrage in May by dispatching a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair plane flying from 
Greece to Lithuania in order to arrest a dissident onboard.

A Belarusian sprinter at the Tokyo Olympics has taken refuge in Poland's embassy in Japan after her criticisms of 
the country's coaches sparked a backlash in Minsk and an alleged attempt to repatriate her against her will.
Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, 24, who had used social media to express dismay at being entered into the 4x400 relay 
even though she has never raced the event, has applied for and been granted a humanitarian visa, Polish officials 
said.
"She's planning to come to Poland, and was invited by us," Marcin Przydacz, Poland's deputy foreign minister told 
the Financial Times.
Having fraudulently claimed victory in last year's presidential election, Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus's leader, has 
embarked on a brutal campaign to suppress protest and the opposition. In May, the Belarusian authorities used a 
false bomb threat and a fighter jet to force a Ryanair plane to land in Minsk, where dissident journalist Roman 
Protasevich was detained.
Tsimanouskaya has not directly criticised Lukashenko but Belarusian media have rounded on her. Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus's opposition leader, told the Financial Times that what happened to Tsimanouskaya was 
"part of the wider crackdown against athletes in Belarus. Today, any criticism of authorities - even sports leadership 
- is considered an attack on the government."
Belarusian sprinter shelters in Polish embassy after backlash from Minsk
Eleanor Bindman, an eastern European politics expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: "This scandal 
did not start out as a political one but has become one due to the extremely heavy-handed response ... by 
Belarusian state media and then the attempt to force her to fly home from Tokyo."
Tsimanouskaya, who was due to compete in the 200m yesterday, stayed at a hotel in Haneda airport on Sunday 
after seeking "protection" from city authorities. The sprinter had said she was afraid of being arrested if she returned 
to Belarus and that she feared for her family. Her husband Arseny Zdanevich has since left Belarus. "Where did I 
go? Kyiv, but I will not give details," he told Sport Express, a Russian sports portal.
Tokyo said it was working with the IOC to determine the athlete's intentions. The police did not respond to a request 
for comment. The IOC said it had requested a report from the Belarus Olympic Committee. The BOC did not 
respond to a request for comment. EU to help Lithuania page 2

 A Belarusian activist who heads an NGO helping his compatriots flee repression in Belarus has disappeared in 
Kiev, his organisation said on Telegram. 
 Vitali Shishov, head of the Belarusian House in Ukraine, went jogging in Kiev on Monday morning but did not return 
and could not be reached on his mobile phone, the organisation said. 
 Friends of Shishov said he had been followed by 'strangers' while jogging recently, human rights organisation 
Vyasna said on Telegram. 
 Police and volunteers had mounted a search of the area where he went running but had failed to locate him, 
Belarusian House said. 
 Many Belarusians have fled, often to neighbouring Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania, as President Alexander 
Lukashenko's regime has cracked down on any form of dissent since mass protests erupted after disputed 
elections last year. 
 Lukashenko has ruled the former Soviet republic with an iron fist since 1994. 
 Shishov's disappearance comes as Belarusian athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya said she was forced to withdraw 
from the Tokyo Olympics and threatened with forced repatriation for criticising her athletics federation on social 
media. 
 The sprinter, who was granted a humanitarian visa by Poland on Monday, said she feared being jailed if she 
returned to her country, where the authorities have targeted the president's opponents, rights activists and 
journalists. 
 Her husband Arseny Zdanevich told AFP he had fled from Belarus to Ukraine and was hoping to join his wife 'in the 
near future'. 
 Lukashenko and his son Viktor have been banned from Olympic events over the targeting of athletes for their 
political views. 
 Lukashenko sparked international outrage in May by dispatching a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair plane flying 
from Greece to Lithuania in order to arrest a dissident onboard.

 A missing Belarusian activist has been found hanged in a park in the Ukrainian capital Kiev, police said on 
Tuesday, adding they had opened a murder probe. 
 Vitaly Shishov, 26, headed the Belarusian House in Ukraine, an NGO helping his compatriots flee repression in 
Belarus. 
 Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko has been cracking down on any form of dissent since mass protests 
erupted after last year's elections, deemed unfair by the West. 
 Many Belarusians have fled, often to neighbouring Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. 
 'Belarusian citizen Vitaly Shishov, who had gone missing in Kiev yesterday, was today found hanged in one of the 
Kiev parks, not far from where he lived,' police said in a statement. 
 Police said they had opened a murder probe and would pursue all leads including a possible 'murderdisguised as 
asuicide'. 
 The Belarusian House in Ukraine accused the Lukashenko regime of being behind the murder of Shishov. 
 'There is no doubt that this is an operation planned by Chekists to liquidate a Belarusian who presented a true 
danger to the regime,' the NGO said in a statement, referring to security service agents. 
 The activist went jogging in Kiev on Monday morning but did not return and could not be reached on his mobile 
phone. 
 Shishov moved to pro-Western Ukraine in the autumn of 2020, after joining anti-government protests in Belarus, 
and helped establish the Belarusian House in Ukraine. 
- 'Followed by strangers' - 
The NGO said that Shishov had been involved in everything from helping fellow compatriots to settle in Ukraine to 
staging anti-regime protests. 
 The group also said that it had repeatedly received warnings about possible 'provocations, including kidnapping 
and liquidation.' 
 Friends of Shishov said he had been followed by 'strangers' while jogging recently, human rights organisation 
Viasna has said. 
Belarus dissident found hanged in Ukraine
 Belarusian authorities have used force to put down historic demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule and have 
been trying to snuff out remaining dissent, jailing university students and shutting down independent media. 
 Shishov's death came as Belarusian athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya said over the weekend she was forced to 
withdraw from the Tokyo Olympics and threatened with forced repatriation for criticising her athletics federation. 
 The sprinter, who was granted a humanitarian visa by Poland on Monday, said she feared being jailed if she 
returned to her country. 
 Her husband Arseny Zdanevich told AFP on Monday he had fled from Belarus to Ukraine and was hoping to join 
his wife 'in the near future'.

 The head of Belarusian House in Ukraine (BHU), an activist organization that helps Belarusians flee abroad, was 
found hanged in a park near his home in Kyiv on Tuesday, the New York Times reports[1]. 
Why it matters: Police say they have launched an investigation into whether the death of Vitaly Shishov, who went 
missing after he left for his daily jog, was "murder disguised as suicide," per CNN[2]. Shishov's colleagues say he 
was "under surveillance" before his death and have accused Belarusian authorities of killing him.One colleague, 
Yuri Shchuchko, said police had warned BHU about threats to activists and the presence of the Belarusian KGB in 
Ukraine, according to the BBC[3]. The big picture: Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in 
power since 1994, has waged a crackdown against anti-government activism[4] in the wake of a fraudulent election 
that he claims to have won last August. Many Belarusian activists have been imprisoned or fled to neighboring 
Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Lukashenko's government in May forced the landing[5] of a Ryanair plane to arrest 
journalist and opposition leader Raman Pratasevich, calling in a fake bomb threat to divert the plane to 
Minsk.Belarusian Olympic sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya said this week that she was taken to the Tokyo airport 
against her will after criticizing her coaches. She told AP Tuesday that she was going to face "punishment"[6] from 
authorities upon her return home. What they're saying: "Devastated by the news of the death of the Belarusian 
activist Vital Shyshou who was found hanged in Kyiv. My heart is with his family. It is worrying that those who flee 
Belarus still can't be safe," tweeted[7] Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.

Portions of Europe are experiencing a tourism resurgence as remote workers look to take advantage of the time 
they have remaining away from the office.
According to Reuters.com, the lifting of COVID-related travel restrictions and cheaper prices have led to a boom for 
the starved tourism industry in Spain and Portugal's most popular vacation destinations.
While the influx of travelers taking workcations has brought relief to the tourism-reliant islands, Spain reported the 
number of international arrivals for the first half of 2021 was still around 33 percent of the 10 million visitors 
recorded during the same period in 2019.
"We have certainly seen a growth in the 'Digital Nomads' category, (which) has been important to the tourism sector 
during the pandemic since it contributed to long-term stays and local economies," the European Union's head of 
research for tourism Jennifer Iduh told Reuters.
Airlines and rental websites are also reporting a spike in bookings, with flights to the Canary Islands up 88 percent 
between April and July when compared to the same period in 2020. Bookings for Tenerife doubled, according to 
low-cost carrier Ryanair.
Property portal Idealista said rental requests for over 15 days in the Canary, Balearic and Madeira islands grew 51 
percent last summer, with the trend continuing into 2021. Tourism officials said an estimated 8,000 remote workers 
have arrived so far this year and an additional 30,000 remote workers are expected to arrive over the next five 
years.
To entice international travelers looking to squeeze in one last workcation, airlines, hotel chains and rental 
companies are offering discounted package deals to people looking to stay in Europe for several weeks.
Last week, the United Kingdom's transport minister announced that fully vaccinated visitors from the European 
Union and United States would be allowed to skip COVID-related quarantine when visiting England.

Belarusian Timanovskaya tells IOC she is safe, gets Polish visa

Belarusian runner Kristina Timanovskaya is "safe and secure" after an alleged kidnapping attempt, the International 
Olympic Committee (IOC) said Monday.
The country's opposition on Sunday accused Belarusian authorities of trying to kidnap the athlete and force her to 
fly home from the Tokyo Olympics after the 24-year-old criticized Belarusian officials.
Timanovskaya had been due to compete in Monday's 200 metre heats.
IOC spokesman Mark Adams said she had spent Sunday night in a hotel at Tokyo's Haneda airport in a "safe 
environment."
She is now in the hands of authorities and the IOC has asked the Belarusian Olympic Committee for a written report 
on the matter.
IOC representatives spoke to her directly and she assured them she felt safe, Adams said.
On Monday she was photographed entering Poland's embassy in Tokyo, with media reports saying she is seeking 
asylum there and could fly to Warsaw as early as Wednesday.
Poland, as well as the Czech Republic and Slovenia, had offered to help and she has now received a visa from 
Poland.
"Poland will do everything necessary to help her continue her sporting career," deputy foreign minister Marcin 
Przydacz wrote on Twitter.

Olympic officials became aware of her situation after she turned to Japanese police at the airport, Tokyo Olympics 
spokesman Masa Takaya said.
The Belarusian Olympic Committee said in a statement that the runner had been examined by a doctor and would 
not take part in the 200m heats because of her "emotional-psychological condition."
Timanovskaya called that a lie in an Instagram post and told the radio station Euroradio in an interview: "They just 
told me to pack my things and fly home."
Tensions between the international community and Belarus are running high due to the ongoing repression of civil 
society and peaceful protests that were unleashed a year ago after disputed elections, which long-time ruler 
Alexander Lukashenko says he won.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who many in the European Union believe won the election, 
has welcomed the IOC's help with Timanovskaya.
The athletes' plight is the latest international scandal to hit Belarus after the country forced a Ryanair flight to land in 
Minsk in May and arrested an opposition figure.

The international Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected an urgent appeal by Belarusian runner Kristina 
Timanovskaya to be allowed to compete in the 200-metre heats at the Olympic Games on Monday, after her 
exclusion by her country's authorities.
The runner had called on the court to overturn the decision made by the Belarusian Olympic Committee, which 
prevented Timanovskaya from taking part in the race.
However, Timanovskaya's application was turned down on the grounds that she had not been able to prove her 
case, the court said.
Earlier on Monday, the runner was granted a humanitarian visa by Poland's embassy in Tokyo, following what she 
described as an attempted kidnapping to forcibly repatriate her after she criticized Belarusian sports officials.
She was photographed entering Poland's embassy in Tokyo, with media reports saying she was seeking asylum 
there and could fly to Warsaw as early as Wednesday.
Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia had all offered to help.

 Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya escaped from a flight to Minsk from the Haneda Airport on Sunday 
and asked for Japanese protection, claiming that her team forced her to return home after she publicly complained 
of a decision made by national coaches. 
 Japanese authorities and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that Tsimanouskaya has been 
placed under Japanese protection[1] as of Monday after she refused to board the flight back home, NBC reported. 
'She has told us she feels safe,' the IOC said in a tweet. 
 Tsimanouskaya was supposed to participate in the 200-meter heats Monday after she performed in the women's 
100-meter heats Friday. The sprinter said the national coach added her to the 4x400 meter relay scheduled 
Thursday without her knowledge after some of the original sprinters were unable to fly to Tokyo as they did not 
complete the required doping tests. 
 Speaking with Reuters[2], the 24-year-old athlete further revealed that after she complained of the issue through a 
video she posted online, the head coach told her that 'there had been an order from above to remove me.' 
 Tsimanouskaya was then ordered to pack and was taken to the Haneda airport by Belarusian Olympic team 
representatives. She said she has since deleted the video. 
 In a statement, the Belarusian Olympic Committee said the decision by coaches to remove Tsimanouskaya from 
the Tokyo Games was under doctor's advice due to her supposed 'emotional, psychological state,' the outlet 
reported. The athlete, however, denied the claims, stating that she was not examined by doctors and is in a 'good 
psychological state.' 
 Tsimanouskaya was also quoted by Belarusian sports news site Tribuna as saying that while she is not scared of 
getting 'kicked out of the national team,' she fears for her safety. 'I am afraid that I might be jailed in Belarus[3],' 
Tsimanouskaya reportedly said. The sprinter did not provide further details on why she thinks she might be put in 
prison when she steps back home. 
 Tsimanouskaya's ordeal came at a time when Belarus remains in intense discord following protests last year 
against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.During last year's rallies, some athletes joined protests against 
Belarusian Olympics Sprinter, Forced To Return From Tokyo, Makes A Dash For Freedom
the Lukashenko regime. Lukashenko's son, Viktor Lukashenko, is also president of the Belarus Olympic 
Committee. 
 The issue on Tsimanouskaya's refusal to board a plane home came roughly two months after Belarusian journalist 
Roman Protasevich[4] was pulled out of his Ryanair flight and arrested in Minsk. Protasevich's girlfriend was also 
arrested. 
 Protasevich's flight, which was supposed to ride from Athens to Vilnius, was forced to land in Minsk. Protasevich is 
known for being a public critic of Lukashenko and his administration. He is accused of organizing public riots. 
 Meanwhile, Tsimanouskaya is reportedly requesting for the IOC to investigate her case. A source from the 
Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation said Tsimanouskaya is now planning to request asylum[5] either in Austria 
or Germany. 
 Head of the foundation, Aliaksandra Herasimenia, said the Polish consulate was first to respond with willingness to 
welcome Tsimanouskaya following an appeal to several countries.

It has been a stream of bad news for Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye over the past 18 months. His airport has 
lost nearly £3bn since the pandemic began, terminals have been mothballed, while he has been engaged in frantic 
government lobbying to reopen UK borders.
But in the past few weeks, the black clouds hanging over aviation seem to be lifting to reveal at least chinks of blue 
sky, prompting Holland-Kaye to call a meeting of airlines and ground-handlers with a new message: make sure you 
are ready for flying to rebound in the coming months.
"I think we have come out of the phase where we just batten down the hatches," he told the Financial Times.
This cautious optimism is slowly spreading across large parts of the ravaged airline industry, which has suffered its 
worst ever crisis as one of the hardest hit sectors in the pandemic, with executives betting that vaccines and 
loosening travel restrictions have cleared the path to recovery.
Confidence is growing fastest in the US, with carriers starting to report profits thanks to a buoyant domestic market, 
while in Europe the new upbeat mood has prompted the region's airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair to plan a

ramp up in their flying schedules during the late summer. "We are in the midst of an unprecedented recovery," 
Doug Parker, American Airlines chief executive, told analysts on the latest quarterly earnings call.
Willie Walsh, ex-head of British Airways owner IAG who now runs global airline trade body Iata, added: "The 
recovery has definitely started in the second half, there are signs of things improving, restrictions being relaxed or 
removed, and we have to take positives from that."
It is a sharp change in fortunes for an industry that has been battered by the pandemic with global airlines losing a 
combined $125bn in 2020 and forecast to lose another $48bn this year by Iata.
Although optimism is tempered by an uneven recovery that has been slow in parts of the world with limited access 
to vaccines and an awareness that new variants could reverse the outlook, the outbreak of positivity is backed by 
the increase in the number of jets in the sky and loosening restrictions.
Since May, the number of planes in the air has risen steadily to its highest level globally since the crisis started, 
according to data from Citigroup, while easing restrictions and signs governments are moving towards living with 
Covid in key markets are at the heart of newfound confidence.
The UK has significantly loosened travel restrictions for vaccinated travellers. Even Singapore, a poster child for 
tough restrictions to contain the virus, this week said it aims to introduce quarantine-free travel for vaccinated 
people in September.
In Europe, a late summer surge in bookings, prompted by an EU-wide digital travel pass brought in at the start of
July, has boosted optimism further, confirming airline executives' hopes that the desire to travel has been 
undimmed by the pandemic. "What we are seeing empirically is there is nothing wrong with the consumer," said 
Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of Hungary-based Wizz Air. "We think the desire to travel is totally intact."
The no-frills, low-cost airline has forecast a complete return to pre-pandemic 2019 levels of flying in August, putting 
it at the forefront of a recovery, led by the short-haul carriers, that is taking hold across Europe this summer.
But even some legacy airlines, hampered by the slow return of long-haul and business trips, are showing signs of 
optimism. Flag carrier Air France-KLM, for example, said it was confident it would return to profit this quarter.
In the US, the speed of the recovery has taken the industry by surprise, with demand for domestic flying snapping 
back so quickly that some flight crews have been left sleeping by baggage reclaims as airlines have failed to find 
enough hotels, according to unions.
There have also been fuel supply shortages at some airports, while American Airlines had to cancel hundreds of 
flights after not having enough pilots this summer.
They are problems the industry will happily face as three of the "Big Four" US carriers reported a profit in the 
second quarter, with the outlier, United, predicting it would also be back in profit by the second half.
Another big plus is an early sign that business travel, one of the last areas to recover, is starting to revive, while 
Boeing on Wednesday said it would cut 10,000 fewer jobs than it forecast in October as the market rebounds.
Even the rapid spread of the Delta variant in a largely vaccinated population, and some companies closing their 
offices again, has not dimmed the enthusiasm.
Still, with US borders closed to most people from the UK and Europe, the industry is waiting for the full reopening of 
transatlantic routes - among the busiest and most lucrative in the world. These are worth about £9bn a year in 
revenue to US and UK carriers, but have stagnated at about 25 per cent of normal flight volumes for more than a 
year.
Clouds lift as confidence returns to aviation Profitability and wanderlust boost optimism in some countries, but 
the industry remains at the mercy of Covid
"We are very close to losing another peak summer season on the important transatlantic market," Iata's Walsh said.
The recovery is also strongly biased towards the well-vaccinated western world, with flight volumes still more than 
40 per cent lower than normal in
Africa, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. Many countries without the luxury of high vaccination rates to counter the 
Delta variant are now in the grip of their worst outbreaks of the pandemic so far.
In Asia, the huge Chinese domestic market, which has more-or-less fully recovered, is skewing the region's overall 
numbers, which are worse than headline figures suggest.
"The already dire situation has recently been compounded by new Covid infections across the region due to the 
Delta variant, with ongoing border restrictions holding back any meaningful restart," said Subhas Menon, the 
director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. Hopes for recovery will be "dim" until governments 
accelerate the vaccine rollout, he added.
Even while well vaccinated Singapore begins to look at gradually opening up, New Zealand has shut the "trans-
Tasman travel bubble" with Australia. Prompted by an outbreak in Australia, it underlines an industry at the mercy 
of changing government policy.
At the same time, Australia's Qantas still expects a more than $1.5bn loss in the 2021 financial year, despite 
government support and a strong network of domestic routes.
In particular, lingering concerns over new variants means executives everywhere are conscious optimism could 
suddenly evaporate. "Clearly we are on an upward trend, but I am not sure it is going to be a straight line like we all 
wish for," said Wizz's Varadi.
But, after 18 months of pain, many of the world's airlines think the worst is over. "We are reaching the light at the 
end of the tunnel," said Luis Gallego, chief executive of BA owner IAG.

It has been a stream of bad news for Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye over the past 18 months. His airport has 
lost nearly £3bn since the pandemic began, terminals have been mothballed, while he has been engaged in frantic 
government lobbying to reopen UK borders.
But in the past few weeks, the black clouds hanging over aviation seem to be lifting to reveal at least chinks of blue 
sky, prompting Holland-Kaye to call a meeting of airlines and ground-handlers with a new message: make sure you 
are ready for flying to rebound in the coming months.
"I think we have come out of the phase where we just batten down the hatches," he told the Financial Times.
This cautious optimism is slowly spreading across large parts of the ravaged airline industry, which has suffered its 
worst ever crisis as one of the hardest hit sectors in the pandemic, with executives betting that vaccines and 
loosening travel restrictions have cleared the path to recovery.
Confidence is growing fastest in the US, with carriers starting to report profits thanks to a buoyant domestic market, 
while in Europe the new upbeat mood has prompted the region's airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair to plan a

ramp up in their flying schedules during the late summer. "We are in the midst of an unprecedented recovery," 
Doug Parker, American Airlines chief executive, told analysts on the latest quarterly earnings call.
Willie Walsh, ex-head of British Airways owner IAG who now runs global airline trade body Iata, added: "The 
recovery has definitely started in the second half, there are signs of things improving, restrictions being relaxed or 
removed, and we have to take positives from that."
It is a sharp change in fortunes for an industry that has been battered by the pandemic with global airlines losing a 
combined $125bn in 2020 and forecast to lose another $48bn this year by Iata.
Although optimism is tempered by an uneven recovery that has been slow in parts of the world with limited access 
to vaccines and an awareness that new variants could reverse the outlook, the outbreak of positivity is backed by 
the increase in the number of jets in the sky and loosening restrictions.
Since May, the number of planes in the air has risen steadily to its highest level globally since the crisis started, 
according to data from Citigroup, while easing restrictions and signs governments are moving towards living with 
Covid in key markets are at the heart of newfound confidence.
The UK has significantly loosened travel restrictions for vaccinated travellers. Even Singapore, a poster child for 
tough restrictions to contain the virus, this week said it aims to introduce quarantine-free travel for vaccinated 
people in September.
In Europe, a late summer surge in bookings, prompted by an EU-wide digital travel pass brought in at the start of
July, has boosted optimism further, confirming airline executives' hopes that the desire to travel has been 
undimmed by the pandemic. "What we are seeing empirically is there is nothing wrong with the consumer," said 
Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of Hungary-based Wizz Air. "We think the desire to travel is totally intact."

Aditya Ghosh, president of IndiGo Airlines (6E, Delhi Int'l) for ten years from August 2008 to July 2018 and known 
during that period as one of India's most successful airline executives, will join a project to launch a new ultra-low-
cost carrier with up to 70 aircraft under the moniker Akasa Air, multiple sources have told The Economic Times.
He will be working with billionaire Indian investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and former Jet Airways (JAI, Mumbai Int'l) 
chief executive Vinay Dube to establish the airline, using the business model of Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) as 
inspiration, the sources said.
Ghosh was initially general counsel for IndiGo owner InterGlobe Enterprises for four years before becoming 
IndiGo's president, growing the neophyte carrier into the country's biggest airline by market share. Since leaving, he 
has been a board member at a string of companies, none of them in aviation, and completed an advanced 
management programme at Harvard Business School.
However, one of the sources said that Ghosh will own a stake of less than 10% in the airline and will be a board 
member rather than playing a role in the management team - though the new venture "will be his key focus." 
Jhunjhunwala will hold 40%, while Dube, the project's chief executive, will have a shareholding of more than 15%.
Boston-based private investment firm PAR Capital Management, which acquired a stake in Sun Country Airlines 
(SY, Minneapolis/St. Paul) in May at the time affiliates of Apollo Global Management sold theirs, and homestay 
specialist Airbnb will also invest in Akasa Air, the sources claimed.
Jhunjhunwala confirmed to local media on July 28 his plans to invest in the start-up, to obtain a no-objection 
certificate (NOC) from India's Ministry of Civil Aviation within 15 days, and then place orders for up to 70 aircraft.
Praveen Iyer, who held prominent posts at Jet Airways and GoAir (G8, Mumbai Int'l), is likely to join the Akasa team 
as chief commercial officer, the sources said, while Anand Srinivasan a former vice-president for revenue 
management at GoAir, will lead information technology operations.

Ryanair eyes potential Max 10 order next year
Ryanair eyes potential Max 10 order next year

Ryanair's chief executive officer (CEO) Michael O'Leary says the carrier is still in discussions with Boeing over a 
possible Boeing 737 Max 10 order but notes talks are being held up over price negotiations.
"We still can't reach an agreement on price. I would say there's a meaningful gap between us and Boeing on price," 
O'Leary explains during a press briefing.
While an order is unlikely this year, the company remains hopeful an agreement can be reached in 2022, according 
to him. However O'Leary underlines the rate and pace of negotiations depends on how the US manufacturer fares 
in the medium term.
"If you see Boeing's orderbook take off in the next 12 to 18 months, we're less likely to have a Ryanair order," 
O'Leary comments.
"They need a couple of large Max 10 orders. We're by far and away Boeing's largest customer outside of the US, 
we're certainly Boeing's largest customer in Europe and so we would be the obvious candidate for a Max 10 order," 
he adds.
Ryanair plans to add 55 new aircraft per year over the next four years, with around 15 to 20 aircraft coming off 
lease per year.
O'Leary says the carrier will be opportunistic when looking to sell used aircraft to keep its fleet age young. 
He notes however it is more likely the aircraft will be needed to match demand expectations over the coming years.
"If second-hand prices are weak, and I think they will be weak for a year or two, we're more likely to extend the 
second lease period or extend the usable life of some of the older aircraft," O'Leary says.
He adds Ryanair is seeing "more growth than we can handle, certainly for the next two years," with all 55 expected 
deliveries already allocated through to next summer.
The Irish carrier aims to increase its fleet to 600 aircraft by 2026. It has ordered 210 197-seat 737 Max 8200s with 
12 already delivered.
Ryanair eyes potential Max 10 order next year
O'Leary also rules out a scenario where the carrier will have to raise cash over the winter season.
He points out the company "very generously endowed" in terms of liquidity with net debt coming back down on 
stronger forward bookings.
Ryanair has around (EURO)4 billion ($4.7 billion) in cash on its balance sheet, including funding for aircraft orders 
over the winter season, according to O'Leary.

Shareholders on board International Airlines Group put up with a lot of turbulence. The shares of the British airways 
owner rose steeply on Wednesday after changes to UK travel restrictions fuelled a US bookings surge. That 
reversed yesterday following a cautious interim results statement.
IAG will fly, at most, 45 per cent of its regular schedule this summer. Though Iberia and Vueling are benefiting from 
pent-up demand, BA - normally the biggest profit generator in the group - is still hampered by tough UK travel 
restrictions. By contrast, Air France-KLM adopted a sunnier tone, laying out plans to fly up to 70 per cent of normal 
capacity this summer.
IAG shares have lost a lot of height since the start of 2020 - down 60 per cent compared with a 56 per cent fall for 
Air France-KLM and a 10 per cent rise for Ryanair. The shares trade on a 2023 EV/ebitda ratio of 3.9. That is 
almost a tenth lower than Air France- KLM, based on UBS figures.
The airline has some strengths, though. Since the financial crisis, it has steered away from business travel, 
increasing exposure to the premium leisure market. Corporate sales account for just 13 per cent of group revenues, 
about a third of the global average. Disruption caused by carbon emission concerns and changing work practices 
affect it less than many peers.
Having shored up its capital base, IAG also has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Net debt to 
ebitda is expected to peak at 3.3 times in 2022 before falling to 1.9 times in 2023, says Citigroup's Sathish 
Sivakumar. It should also be a beneficiary of Norwegian, Thomas Cook and Air New Zealand opting out of UK-US 
routes, which together accounted for 11 per cent of seats.
IAG: late take-off
Recovery will be a long haul.
Passenger demand is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until at least 2023. But once the Covid-19 fog has 
cleared, a more encouraging view of IAG's prospects will emerge.

British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG) is behind its competitors in terms of 
capacity for the summer as a big chunk of its operations has traditionally been long-haul flights.
The FTSE 100 group said it will fly at 45% of 2019 capacity in the summer months, while Wizz Air Holdings 
(AIM:WIZZ) Plc and easyJet PLC forecast to reach 90-100% and 60% respectively.
READ: British Airways owner IAG to fly at 45% of 2019 capacity in summer months
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), instead, didn't give a specific figure but said it will pick up from the collapse of 
some of its European competitors, such as Flybe and Germanwings, as it eyes a strong rebound in travel as most 
people get vaccinated against COVID-19.
"IAG's in the business of flying people around the world, a tricky place to be in a global pandemic," said Laura Hoy, 
analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
"Long-haul traffic will be last to recover, and IAG's position within Europe means it's at the mercy of many of 
different government restrictions. The group doesn't expect passenger demand to return to pre-pandemic levels 
until 2023 at the earliest, leaving no choice but to continue paring down operations. This will undoubtedly leave 
scars that will follow the group well into the future."
British Airways owner IAG lags UK competitors due to reliance on long-haul flights
IAG had (EURO)10.2bn of liquidity at the end of June after completing a series of financing deals and bond issues, 
while it continues to focus on cost savings to adjust to lower demand. British Airways even agreed to defer monthly 
pension deficit contributions for £450mln.
"Prospects for business travel, a key arena for British Airways, also remains clouded, with virtual meetings during 
the pandemic potentially making the costs and time of physical travel harder to justify in the future," said Keith 
Bowman, analyst at interactive investor.
"More favourably, IAG has taken considerable action since the start of the pandemic to conserve cash, bolster its 
finances and wait out the worst crisis in the industry's history. Vaccination rates across much of the world continue 
to rise and governments such as those in the UK and US remain eager to ease restrictions."
Shares tumbled 7% to 169.02p on Friday morning.

Brussels re-approves (EURO)525mn German state aid to Condor

The European Commission has re-approved Germany's EUR525.3 million (USD620 million) bailout of Condor (DE, 
Frankfurt Int'l), after the European General Court rejected an earlier approval following a challenge from Ryanair 
(FR, Dublin Int'l).
The measures would enable Berlin to compensate the charter carrier for losses directly suffered as a result of travel 
restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, EC Executive Vice-President, Margrethe Vestager, said in a 
statement.
The Commission's new approval comes after Ryanair won an annulment at the European Unions' General Court of 
an earlier EC decision. Under its terms, the Commission had approved compensation to Condor for the period 
March 17 to December 31, 2020, in the form of two loans, with a nominal amount of EUR550 million (USD648.6 
million) and an aid amount of EUR267.1 million (USD314.9 million), based on estimates of damages. The new 
decision was based on the actual damages suffered. Condor would repay anything received in excess of the actual 
amount, plus interest.
The Irish low-cost carrier has also sought to undo bailouts of Lufthansa, Air France, TAP Air Portugal, and other 
major EU airlines, mostly without success. Earlier this month the Commission announced it was re-approving aid of 
EUR1.2 billion (USD1.4 billion) to TAP following a similar challenge by Ryanair. The Irish carrier is also litigating 
against EUR150 million (USD176.8 million) in state aid granted to Austrian Airlines.
Meanwhile, the EC said it found Germany's aid package to Condor to be in line with EU state aid rules and to be 
proportionate of Condor's losses as a result of COVID-19. The approval was based on three separate EC 
decisions, comprising two sums of EUR204.1 million (USD240.7 million) plus EUR321.2 million (USD378.8 million) 
of restructuring support.
In the first decision, the EC approved EUR144.1 million (USD170 million) of loans in compensation for the period 
March 17 to December 31, 2020. In the second decision, it approved additional compensation of EUR60 million 
(USD70.7 million) for the period January 1 to May 31, 2021.
Thirdly, the Commission also approved Germany's EUR321.2 million (USD378.9 million) support for the 
restructuring of Condor, which started in October 2019 and was envisaged to end September 2023. This involved 
Brussels re-approves (EURO)525mn German state aid to Condor
writing off an additional EUR90 million (USD106.1 million) of existing loans and restructuring remaining loans, as 
well as writing off EUR20.2 million (USD23.8 million) of interest.
Condor and its new private investor, Attestor, will fund more than 70% of the restructuring. Its creditors have agreed 
to write off more than EUR630 million (USD743.3 million) of claims. Attestor has committed to inject EUR200 million 
(USD235.9 million) of equity and to provide a further EUR250 million (USD294.9 million) for Condor's fleet renewal. 
The airline has committed to a capacity cap of its fleet during the restructuring period (until September 2023) in 
order to limit any impact on fair competition resulting from the financial aid, the EC noted.
Ryanair has estimated the total state aid to airlines approved by Brussels since the beginning of the pandemic at 
more than EUR30 billion (USD35.4 million), including EUR11 billion (USD12.9 billion) to Lufthansa, EUR10.6 billion 
(USD12.5 billion) to Air France-KLM, EUR3.5 billion (USD4.1 billion) to Alitalia, and EUR1.3 billion (USD1.5 billion) 
to SAS Scandinavian Airlines, as well as EUR1.2 billion (USD1.4 billion) to Finnair, EUR0.8 billion (USD0.9 billion) 
to Norwegian, EUR0.65 billion (USD0.7 billion) to LOT Polish Airlines, and EUR0.5 billion (USD0.58 billion) to Air 
Europa.

Fighting back
Its troubles are not over, but the 737 Max programme has landed significant new orders, while Boeing progresses 
with clearing a hundreds-deep inventory of stored jets
Despite ongoing technical issues, Boeing has recently landed significant new orders for the once-grounded 737 
Max narrowbody, progressed with clearing a hundreds-deep inventory of stored jets and achieved first flight of the 
Max 10.
“It’s onward and upward,” Cirium head of valuations George Dimitroff says of the Max programme. “As a whole, the 
programme will get back to health.”
Boeing passed the highest hurdle in November 2020, when the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lifted the 
type’s 20-month grounding. During that period, Boeing had continued manufacturing the jets despite not delivering 
them, consequently accumulating an inventory of some 450 aircraft.
Finally, in December 2020, the airframer resumed deliveries and began working through the inventory, aiming to 
deliver about half of the stored jets by the end of 2021 and the majority of the remainder by end-2022.
Boeing has since whittled its Max inventory down to about 340 aircraft, some of which it produced after the FAA 
lifted the grounding, Cirium data shows.
But the Max programme suffered a setback this year when airlines pulled 106 aircraft from service due to an electric 
grounding issue involving standby power control units. The FAA approved Boeing’s fix in May, though the issue led 
Boeing to temporarily halt Max deliveries.

Still, Boeing has landed new Max orders in recent months, and surging air travel demand (at least in the USA) 
bodes well for continued sales.

Southwest Airlines ordered 100 737 Max 7s in March, throwing a major wave of support behind the smallest Max 
variant, which Boeing expects to begin delivering in 2022. This year, Boeing has also secured Max orders from 
Alaska Airlines, United Airlines, financial company 777 Partners and lessors Dubai Aerospace and Aviation Capital. 
It has concurrently logged Max cancellations, but Max orders in 2021 through May exceeded cancellations by 61 
jets, company data shows.
Boeing’s Max momentum accelerated in June. Mid-month, it delivered the first of its high-capacity 737 Max 8-200 
variant to UK low-cost carrier Ryanair. Then, on 18 June, the first 737 Max 10 got airborne, kicking off a certification 
campaign that Boeing says will lead to a first delivery in 2023.

The Max programmes faces several remaining hurdles, notable among those being China’s re-certification of the 
jet. When that might happen remains unclear; the process appears snarled in the broad US-China trade dispute. 
But China’s approval is critical – the country’s airlines will generate an expected 25% of the aerospace industry’s 
growth in the next decade, Boeing chief executive David Calhoun recently said.
Ensuring the Max’s success means more to Boeing than about anything else. Of the 4,121 jets in Boeing’s backlog 
at the end of May, 3,291 – 80% – were 737s (the majority being Max, with a small number being 737NG-based 
military surveillance jets), according to company figures. Boeing needs revenue from those deliveries to fund its 
future.
The company intends to ramp up 737 Max production to 31 jets monthly in early 2022. But the FAA remains 
involved. The agency still holds responsibility for issuing Max airworthiness certificates – the documents that clear 
individual aircraft to fly. The FAA took that duty from Boeing in 2019.
Additionally, as part of a 2021 settlement with the FAA, Boeing agreed to perform a safety risk assessment of its 
“readiness for increasing” Max production. The FAA will have the chance to evaluate Boeing’s readiness ahead of 
production rate increases. w

737 Max
Its troubles are not entirely over, but the 737 Max programme has landed some significant new orders, as Boeing 
looks to clear a huge inventory of aircraft

Despite ongoing technical issues, Boeing has won new orders for the once-grounded 737 Max narrowbody, 
progressed with clearing a hundreds-deep inventory of stored jets and achieved first flight of the Max 10.
“It’s onward and upward,” Cirium head of valuations George Dimitroff says of the Max programme. “As a whole, the 
programme will get back to health.”

1 additional based aircraft, $100m investment, 36 routes (8 new)
Ryanair, Italy's No.1 airline, today (27th July) announced it will further expand its presence at Malpensa Airport, with 
1 additional based aircraft for the Winter season (8 in total). This will represent a total investment of $100m in 
Malpensa and will create 30 additional Ryanair jobs. As vaccination rollouts continue, Europe's tourism is opening 
up and Ryanair's increased connectivity will play a crucial role in the restoration of air traffic in the Milan region 
these Summer and Winter seasons.
Ryanair's Malpensa Summer '21 schedule will deliver:
7 based aircraft supporting 210 Ryanair jobs
30 routes in total (8 domestic / 22 international)
194 weekly flights
4 new routes: Barcelona (7pw), Corfu (2pw), Santorini (4pw) and Zakynthos (2pw)
Ryanair's Malpensa Winter '21 schedule will deliver:
8 based aircraft (+1 / $100m investment) supporting 240 Ryanair jobs
30 routes in total (9 domestic / 21 international)
243 weekly flights
4 new routes: Aarhus (2pw), Malta (2pw), Naples (21pw) and Sibiu (2pw)
Italian citizens/visitors can now book a well-deserved break at even lower fares (with the reassurance of a "zero" 
change fee should plans change). To celebrate, Ryanair has launched a (EURO)19.99 seat sale for travel until 
March 2022, which must be booked by midnight Thursday, 29th of July on www.Ryanair.com.
Ryanair's Director of Commercial, Jason McGuinness, said:
Ryanair expands in Malpensa
"As Italy's largest airline, we are delighted to deliver recovery and growth to Milan Malpensa and the regions as Italy 
emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. Following the successful vaccination programmes, Italian air traffic - led by 
Ryanair - is set to recover strongly and we are pleased to announce our extended Summer and Winter schedules 
for Malpensa, including an additional based aircraft from Winter with an overall investment of $100m, supporting 
over 30 additional direct jobs.
With 36 destinations to choose from across summer and winter - including 4 new routes in both seasons - our 
customers will be spoiled for choice when planning their next sun holiday to the likes of Malta, Santorini and 
Zakynthos or a city break getaway to Aarhus, Barcelona or Sibiu. 
Following the successful vaccination programmes, the launch of the EU Digital Covid Cert and easing of 
restrictions, travel is set to recover strongly this year. To celebrate, we are releasing a seat sale from just 
(EURO)19.99 for travel until March 2022, which are available to book until midnight Thursday, 29th of July. Since 
these amazing low prices will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and avoid 
missing out."
SEA's VP Aviation Business Development, Andrea Tucci, said:
 "SEA Milan Airports is very pleased with the new investments by Ryanair at Malpensa airport, consisting of an 
additional aircraft based, new frequencies and new destinations and delivering positive employment impact on our 
territory.
The partnership between SEA Milan airports and Ryanair goes on generating very important results for Malpensa, 
such as the full restoration of Ryanair preCovid capacity at the airport and further developments for the future. 
Thanks to the recovery of Ryanair and several other carriers, as well as to the measures implemented by SEA to 
protect passengers in this difficult phase, SEA airport system is growing in terms of route portfolio and is rapidly 
recovering both capacity, traffic and market share, resulting actually the number one national airport system by 
volume of passenger traffic in the first half of 2021."

Wizz Air shareholders back £100m bonus Airlines

Wizz Air's chief executive Jozsef Varadi has won shareholder approval for a potential £100m payout in a vote that 
was open to only a small proportion of investors because of Brexit.
Just under two-thirds of the votes at Wizz's annual meeting were cast in favour of the bonus scheme, with about a 
third voting against.
But the votes represented just 16 per cent of the company's issued share capital, far below the average for a UK-
listed company and much lower than the previous turnouts at the company.
In late December Wizz significantly watered down the voting rights of investors from outside the European 
Economic
Area in order to comply with EU rules around airline ownership following Brexit. Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, 
took similar action.
EU regulations demand that airlines with EU operating licences are majority owned and controlled by nationals of 
the bloc, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.
"The Brexit component has substantially reduced the number of shareholders that can vote," said Mark Simpson, 
an aviation analyst at Goodbody.
Wizz Air shareholders back £100m bonus Airlines
Wizz's board consulted investors before drawing up the pay scheme, and received the most pushback from 
UKbased institutions, an insider said.
Wizz said its board had "engaged extensively with shareholders to discuss our approach to remuneration and to 
seek feedback", adding: "The board understands the issues raised by certain shareholders but is wholly satisfied 
that the adoption of the [bonus scheme and remuneration policy] are in the best interests of the company, its 
shareholders and other stakeholders."
Shareholders shot down a short-term remuneration plan at last year's annual meeting, when investors owning 
about 80 per cent of the issued share capital voted. According to Equiniti, about 75 per cent of FTSE 100 share 
capital is voted on average, falling to 54 per cent for smaller UK-listed companies.
Under the newly approved pay plan, Varadi will be granted up to £100m in shares if London-listed Wizz's shares 
climb from their current £47 to £120 over the next five years.

'A big sigh of relief has rippled through the travel and aviation sector with the confirmation from the UK Transport 
Secretary that double jabbed arrivals from the US and the European Union will no longer have to isolate.

 Speculation that a decision was imminent had pushed up shares in British Airways owner IAG which is heavily 
reliant on transatlantic bookings. Rolls Royce was also among the FTSE 100[5] risers, given that the group's bread 
and butter comes from servicing and delivering wide body aircraft engines, which are used primarily for long-haul 
flights. There are higher hopes its recovery will materialise more quickly with normality beginning to return for the 
airline industry. 
 But questions remain about just how many tourists will come flocking, given that travel to the UK still isn't advised

summer season. In the FTSE 250, EasyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air maintained their higher trajectory with 
investors[6] hopeful that EU travellers might now widen their travel plans, which have been largely limited to inside 
the block. Ryanair took delivery of its first batch of 'Gamechanger' aircraft just days after Portugal was removed 
from the green list, so a reopening of routes for vaccinated tourists will be particularly reassuring. 
 The relaxation of the rules for double jabbed tourists is the comfort blanket caterer SSP has longed for, and it was 
one of the top risers on the FTSE 250[7]. It relies on travellers to pick up snacks from its Upper Crust kiosks, 
Ritazza cafes and other franchise outlets. Investors are clearly hoping that now the stage is set for tourists to return, 
footfall will finally rebound across its airport and train station network, where the chain runs concessions. 
 However uncertainty still remains for the travel sector, given that for now the traffic lights appear to be stuck on 
amber for many destinations, and amber plus for France, leaving so many holiday plans still in disarray.''

report of a wider fiscal Q1 2022 loss, as the company raised its fiscal-year passenger volume guidance following a 
surge in bookings in recent weeks. 
Credit Suisse's new price target on Ryanair's Ireland-traded shares is EUR18.80, up from EUR18.65, while the firm 
kept its investment rating on the shares at outperform.
Monday, Ryanair reported a loss per share for its fiscal Q1 ended June 30 that was wider than in the year-earlier 
period despite revenue nearly tripling year over year. Still, customers soared to 8.1 million from just 0.5 million a 
year earlier, and the company forecast a continued climb in traffic as travel restrictions ease for passengers that 
have received COVID-19 vaccines.
Ryanair said it expects traffic to reach almost 9 million in July and more than 10 million in August as long as there 
are no further setbacks in Europe related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the full fiscal year, the company now expects traffic in a range of 90 million to 100 million, up from its previous 
guidance for the lower end of a range of 80 million to 120 million. Ryanair also said it "cautiously" expects that the 
"likely outcome" for the fiscal year "is somewhere between a small loss and breakeven."
Credit Suisse thus pared its estimated net loss for Ryanair's fiscal year while boosting its estimate for passenger 
traffic, which led to the higher price target. The firm described Ryanair as "a carrier that we believe is very well 
positioned to benefit from competitor restructuring challenges over both the short and the medium term" and said it 
sees the company as "positioned to recover profitability quickly."
Ryanair Gets Price Target Lift to EUR18.80 From EUR18.65 From Credit Suisse Amid Higher Passenger View; 
Outperform Kept
Ryanair's Irish shares have an average investment rating of outperform from analysts polled by Capital IQ, with 
price targets ranging from EUR16 to EUR22.50.

After court ruling, EU Commission reapproves German aid for Condor
After court ruling, EU Commission reapproves German aid for Condor

The European Commission has approved an updated state bailout package of 525 million euros (618 million 
dollars) for German airline Condor following a court ruling last month that found the previous authorization decision 
lacked necessary detail.
The German plan, comprising loans and aid in the form of debt relief, should compensate the firm for coronavirus-
related damages and help finance a restructuring that will help it get back on solid footing, the EU executive said in 
a press release on Tuesday.
"The aviation sector has been hit particularly hard by the various travel restrictions necessary to contain the spread 
of the coronavirus," EU executive branch vice-president Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said in 
a written statement.
In June, the EU General Court annulled commission decisions from April 2020 approving coronavirus-related state 
aid to Condor: the airline was granted two loans of 550 million euros.
The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to be paid out, the court 
ruled.
Condor managed to avert insolvency last year and left "protective shield" proceedings in December. In May, the 
company found a new investor and a way to hold on the remaining 4,050 jobs.
Budget carrier Ryanair took the commission to court in a slew of cases this year, arguing that its approving a host of 
state aid measures to airlines across Europe distorted competition in the bloc.
The company won certain cases in first instance, for example related to state aid to Dutch KLM and Portuguese 
TAP, but lost others, such as a complaint against aid given to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair.

Signs of a long-awaited recovery in European aviation are growing after Ryanair reported a "surge" in late summer 
bookings and raised its forecast for passenger numbers over the next year. The low-cost carrier said the rebound 
was down to vaccinations, the introduction of an EU-wide digital travel pass this month and the rollback of isolation 
rules for vaccinated travellers in the UK.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, predicted a recovery in air travel over the winter and into next summer. 
"We have seen a strong rebound in pent-up travel demand," he said.
Shares closed 4 per cent up at (EURO)16.32 yesterday and are trading above levels just before the outbreak of 
coronavirus.
The carrier's upbeat outlook mirrors rival easyJet, which last week said it would increase its number of flights over 
the late summer due to strong bookings, particularly from continental Europe.
Heathrow airport also yesterday said the UK was "emerging from the worst effects" of the pandemic but said the 
country was lagging behind the recovery in continental Europe. The industry has been desperate for any signs of a 
sustained rebound in demand for flying following 15 months of mounting losses.
Ryanair produced a net loss of (EURO)273m in the three months to the end of June, with Easter largely a write-off. 
This compared with a net loss of (EURO)185m in the same quarter last year. The airline carried 8.1m passengers in 
Ryanair reports late summer booking surge Airlines
the quarter, but outlined how flying has since rapidly rebounded, with 9m passengers forecast for July and 10m for 
August. Ryanair was taking 2m bookings a week in June, four times more than in March.
With passengers booking late and fares below pre-Covid levels, Ryanair warned that it was still difficult to provide 
meaningful earnings guidance, but expects to post "somewhere between" a small loss and break-even this financial 
year, which runs until the end of March.
It expects to carry between 90m and 100m passengers in the year, up from its previous guidance, which was at the 
lower end of a range between 80m and 120m. Ryanair carried 149m passengers a year pre-Covid, and hopes to 
reach 200m a year in four years' time.
O'Leary hopes to emerge from the Covid crisis stronger as weaker rivals retrench and growth opportunities open up 
across Europe. The airline has a strong balance sheet and had (EURO)4.6bn in cash at the end of June, up from 
(EURO)3.2bn three months earlier. Net debt fell during the quarter, from (EURO)2.3bn to (EURO)1.7bn.
But the rise of Wizz Air has offered competition in the ultra-low cost end of the industry, with the London-listed and 
Hungary-based airline also planning a rapid expansion as Covid-19 fades. Wizz's shareholders will today vote on a 
pay package that will reward chief executive Jozsef Varadi with a bonus of up to £100m if he can rapidly expand the 
airline after the pandemic.
Still, losses are piling up across the industry. Heathrow posted an adjusted loss of £787m in the first half and said 
fewer than 4m passengers had passed through the airport this year, a number that would have taken just 18 days 
to reach before the pandemic.

Let competitive forces fly in the airline recovery
Let competitive forces fly in the airline recovery

R ailing against the anti-competitive tendencies of the aviation industry is part of the regular schtick if you're a low-
cost airline.
The pandemic has provided a wealth of new material. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has complained loudly about 
competing against the "crack cocaine, state-aid junkies" created by a wave of European government bailouts, 
following up with more than 20 court complaints. His latest source of ire involves airport slots, the seemingly prosaic 
business of getting permission to use airport infrastructure at a certain time and date, and whether hoarding them 
will impede recovery. He has a point.
One of the peculiarities of this almighty crisis is that, even in the UK where aviation has had precious little in the 
way of sector-specific support, elements of the industry that seemed ripe for disruption have been preserved in 
aspic instead. "Use it or lose it" rules, which require airlines to fly 80 per cent of the time to retain precious slots, 
were waived during the pandemic as part of efforts to conserve cash and stop the flying of empty aircraft. As the 
recovery picks up, with Ryanair increasing its forecast for passenger numbers this year as travel restrictions ease, 
that becomes impossible to justify.
The UK, where travel restrictions remain strict but also lamentably unpredictable, has proposed asking airlines to fly 
50 per cent of journeys over the winter to preserve their slots. This comes with carve-outs for countries on the 
government's red list of travel restrictions, and the ability to hand back a full batch of slots without penalty.
Let competitive forces fly in the airline recovery
The EU, where the digital Covid-19 pass has prompted a recovery in flying, has gone further: it also wants airlines 
to fly half their slots but without any intra-EU suspensions on the rules and without an option to surrender slots for 
the season.
The fact that this has provoked an unhappy response from parties on all sides tells you it's probably a reasonable 
compromise, as a first step.
The angst breaks down along predictable lines. Legacy airlines, such as British Airways or European flag carriers, 
want to hold on to slots as long as possible, particularly given the slow expected recovery in their most valuable 
longhaul routes and business fares.
Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Wizz Air want to increase their ability to get hold of slots to expand. Airports 
such as Heathrow, which yesterday said it expects fewer passengers in 2021 than last year, simply want footfall, 
wherever it comes from.
In the UK, airlines can buy slots from each other on a short-term basis, though the prospect of investing in a new 
route only to lose it when the market recovers (as well as propping up a rival) doesn't necessarily appeal.
One mystery is how the byzantine slot system has survived this long. The Competition and Markets Authority in 
2018 suggested moving to a market-based system, arguing that the current rules were inefficient. The 
government's aviation strategy noted the system was not designed to "stimulate a competitive market environment", 
and could result in poor outcomes for consumers.
There may be an opportunity to rethink the UK system, which after Brexit now falls to the Department for
Transport. This amounts to heresy for the airlines, which treat slots as sacred assets, including using them as 
collateral against borrowing. But others in the sector concede that there could be ways of reforming the system to 
increase competition, and align with policy objectives around connectivity or indeed decarbonisation.
In the meantime, there may need to be a mechanism to shake loose slots from weakened or nationalised 
incumbents. Ryanair said yesterday that bailed-out airlines such as Portugal's TAP and long-suffering Alitalia had 
cut their short-haul fleets by 20-30 per cent as part of restructurings and that other operators were "sitting on slots 
that they're not using". That could mean a shortage in capacity in the future, given it takes over a year for unused 
slots to be reallocated to another airline. Airlines with slots they can't use shouldn't be allowed to hold and hope for 
too long. helen.thomas@ft.com
There may be an opportunity to rethink the UK system ... to increase competition

 Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) admitted that it temporarily faced operational issues due to staffing problems but called 
Ryanair's (RYA.L) accusations of suffering from operational chaos "misleading and inaccurate," Reuters reported 
Monday.
The low-cost air carrier's Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary previously accused British airline Wizz Air of 
canceling hundreds of flights and flying empty planes to meet regulations requiring pilots and plane crew to fly a 
minimum period of time or undergo additional training.
Wizz Air, on the other hand, responded that an unrelated rostering issue, which has since been resolved, disrupted 
its operations for three days.
Wizz Air's stock gained over 1%, while Ryanair grew by over 4% on Monday's close.

Jul 27, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] incurred a loss of $1.46 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Jun 30, 
2021), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.50. Following the earnings release, shares of 
the company gained 2.6% at the close of business on Jul 26. 
The amount of loss, however, increased year over year due to cancelation of most Easter flights and slow easing of 
the European Union's coronavirus-led travel restrictions in May and June. Although quarterly revenues of $446.4 
million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $459 million, it skyrocketed more than 100% from the year-
ago period, which was characterized by significant decline in traffic owing to large-scale travel restrictions amid 
rising coronavirus cases. 
Ryanair's net loss for the quarter came in at €273 million compared with the year-ago quarter's net loss of €185 
million. Traffic jumped to 8.1 million customers in the reported quarter from a mere 0.5 million in the first quarter of 
fiscal 2021, thanks to increased capacity in May and June. Load factor in the period was 73%, a 12-percentage-
point improvement from the year-ago period. 
Ancillary revenues augmented to €178.6 million from only €24.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to 
significant improvement in traffic, and strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating. With a 
'sevenfold increase in sectors flown', the airline's fuel and oil expenses surged to €157 million in the fiscal first 
quarter from €8.9 million in the year-ago period. With increased operations, total operating expenses climbed more 
than 100% year over year to €675 million. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), had cash of €4.06 billion at the 
end of Jun 30, 2021 compared with €3.15 billion at the end of Mar 31, 2021. Outlook With the rollout of EU Digital 
Covid Certificates on Jul 1 and the relation of the United Kingdom's quarantine rules for fully vaccinated travelers, 
Ryanair has witnessed accelerated recovery in bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. However, fares are 
still way below pre-coronavirus levels, the airline stated. It now anticipates fiscal 2022 traffic to be in the range of 90 
million-100 million (previous guidance: low end of 80 million-120 million). The company expects to either incur a 
small loss or break even in fiscal 2022, provided vaccine rollout continues this summer and the coronavirus 
situation remains under control. 
With improving close-in bookings, the company estimates traffic to increase to about 9 million in July from more 
than 5 million in June. The same is predicted to be more than 10 million in August. The airline is seeing a strong 
pent up travel demand for August and September, which it expects to continue into the second half of fiscal 2022.

FTSE 100 opened lower as markets in Asia were rocked by China's latest move to control the activity of tech firms.  
London's blue-chip index shed 37 points at 6,990 in early dealings.
China latest clamp down is on online education groups with a wave of new restrictions sending share prices in 
companies listed in Hong Kong and the US plummeting up to 70%.  The news followed fines by China for music 
steaming giant Tencent over its exclusive music deals and a probe into ride-hailing app Didi.
Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) raised its passenger forecast for passengers this year as routes start to open up. The low-
cost carrier flew 8.1mln passengers in the three months to June up from 500,000 a year ago and now expects to 
carry between 90mln and 100mln passengers this financial year.
Britain's economy is growing at its fastest pace in 80 years and could be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of 
2021 according the EY Item Club. The well-regarded think tank expects GDP this year to jump by 7.6%.
Among the small caps, CentralNic Group PLC (LON:CNIC) said full-year revenue will be well ahead of market 
expectations after a strong second quarter. The internet platform company has achieved record organic growth.
Galantas Gold Corp (AIM:GAL, TSX-V:GAL, OTC:GALKF, FRA:G2V2) (LON:GAL) is about to start an underground 
exploration programme at the Omagh gold mine in Northern Ireland. Drilling will focus on two veins.
United Oil & Gas PLC (AIM:UOG, FRA:1UO) (AIM:UOG) posted much higher average daily oil production that 
guided previously. Operations in Egypt have been performing beyond expectations said the oil and gas group.

Ryanair expects break even year as passenger numbers recover

Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) expects to be close to breaking even this year even though Covid-19 disruption meant its 
latest quarterly losses increased.
The low-cost carrier flew 8.1mln passengers in the three months to June, the airline's fiscal first quarter, up from 
500,000 a year ago.
Consequently, it expects to carry between 90mln and 100mln passengers this financial year compared to guidance 
of around 80mln previously.
That will result in a small loss or breakeven for the year, Ryanair added.
"We are seeing a strong rebound of pent up travel demand into Aug. & Sept. and we expect this to continue into the 
second half of FY22, with pre-Covid-19 growth planned to resume strongly in summer 2022,"  said the statement.
Losses in the quarter to June totalled (EURO)273mln ((EURO)185mln) as a recovery in revenues to 
(EURO)371mln from (EURO)125mln a year ago was outstripped by costs rising to (EURO)675mln from 
(EURO)313mln.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said Covid-19 had  "continued to wreak havoc on our business during Q1" with 
most Easter flights cancelled and a slower than expected easing of EU travel restrictions into May and June. 
"Significant uncertainty around travel green lists (particularly in the UK) and extreme government caution in Ireland 
meant that Q1 bookings were close-in and at low fares. 
Ryanair expects break even year as passenger numbers recover
"Pricing remains below pre-Covid-19 levels and there will continue to be great value for Ryanair guests travelling 
this summer as we focus on recovering traffic, jobs and tourism across our European network.
"Based on current (close-in) bookings, we expect traffic to rise from over 5mln in June to almost 9mln in July, and 
over 10mln in August"
The airline had  (EURO)4.06bn cash with almost 90% of its B737 fleet unencumbered at quarter-end, the statement 
added.

Heathrow and airlines tell UK to open up travel as hopes rise for U.S. visitors

London's Heathrow Airport and Britain's main airlines urged the UK to open up travel to vaccinated passengers or 
face more job losses, as hopes rose that travellers from the United States could be given the green light this week.
Heathrow Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye said Britain could exempt fully vaccinated U.S. citizens from 
quarantine in the coming days, in what would be a huge boost to the country's aviation industry which continues to 
be plagued by uncertainty.
Strict rules which the government has previously altered with little notice has meant that Britain's travel sector 
remains in the doldrums while Europe's has partially recovered.
Airlines UK, the industry body representing British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, easyJet and others, warned more 
aviation jobs would go if the government did not make changes at its next travel review expected later this week.
It wants quarantine to be scrapped for fully vaccinated travellers from the United States and the European Union, 
with more countries added to Britain's green list for low risk travel.
Holland-Kaye noted the EU had opened up unilaterally with the United States, adding: "There's no reason why the 
UK shouldn't do the same. I think that could happen this week."
Heathrow, which before the pandemic was Europe's busiest airport, said Britain's travel restrictions were 
suppressing trade volumes and traveller demand, pushing its cumulative pandemic losses to $4 billion.
Passenger levels at Heathrow were about 20-25% of their pre-pandemic levels, while European airports are already 
back to about 50%, said Holland-Kaye.
"Without the passenger planes going to global markets like the U.S., UK exports aren't getting out of the country, 
and the UK will fall behind and that will cost jobs, unless we open up," he told Reuters on Monday.
For the whole of 2021, Heathrow forecast 21.5 million passengers would travel through its terminals, a big jump 
from 4 million in the first six months of the year as travel returns, but a long way off the 81 million who used its 
facilities in 2019.
Heathrow and airlines tell UK to open up travel as hopes rise for U.S. visitors
Holland-Kaye said he was encouraged by a recent pickup as school holidays started. Separately Ryanair said it 
was seeing strong summer bookings.
Heathrow said worries over potential new UK restrictions or other countries barring UK travellers, had pushed it to 
seek a waiver of its Heathrow Finance ICR covenant for 2021 to cover it in case passenger numbers significantly 
miss its 21 million forecast.
For the six months to June 30, Heathrow posted an adjusted pretax loss of 787 million pounds, compared with a 
471 million loss for the same period last year. ($1 = 0.7274 pounds)

Ryanair could place a significant order for Boeing's 737 MAX 10 aircraft this year but only if the price is right as the 
airline is not under any time pressure, its chief financial officer said on Monday.
A large order from Ryanair, Boeing's largest European airline customer, would provide a major boost to the MAX, 
which was grounded for 20 months after two fatal crashes.
Ryanair is already the largest European customer for the MAX, with 210 firm orders of the 197-seat MAX200 model.
It has repeatedly said it is interested in a significant order of the larger 230-seat MAX 10, which took off on its 
maiden flight in June.
"Maybe the back end of the year we will do something. Maybe not. It's all predicated on price," CFO Neil Sorahan 
told Reuters in an interview on the publication of the airline's results for its April-June quarter.
"If the price is right, we're interested but it's a post FY26 time frame so we are under no time pressure there," he 
said, referring to the airline's financial year to March 31, 2026, when its current order ends.
In a presentation to investors O'Leary said the MAX 10 was something the airline would "revisit with Boeing maybe 
towards the end of the year."
"We think the MAX 10 is a great aircraft, but you know we are very disciplined in Ryanair we will only place orders 
when we think the price is right," O'Leary said.

BT , airlines and oilers among blue-chip bonanza in coming week
BT, airlines and oilers among blue-chip bonanza in coming week

The coming week is set to see a bonanza of results and updates from some of the LSE's major blue-chip stocks 
including major oilers BP and Shell, telecoms firm BT, airlines Ryanair, Wizz Air and BA owner IAG.
Also in focus will be the FTSE 100's drug giants GSK and AstraZeneca (LSE:AZN), tobacco firm BAT and another 
batch of earnings from the large US corporates.
Meanwhile, the macro calendar will be in focus on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve makes its latest decision 
on interest rates.
Budget airlines descend with trading updates
Things looked to be getting better for the airline industry until the Delta variant of COVID-19 muddied the picture. 
Passenger numbers have picked up but shilly-shallying over travel restrictions has made it difficult for 
holidaymakers to book flights with confidence in the summer holiday season.
For Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), which will deliver a trading update on Monday, predicting quarterly revenue 
of (EURO)420mln, up from (EURO)125mln in the same quarter of last year and ahead of the consensus forecast of 
(EURO)376mln.
Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) are expected to be negative, with UBS going for a loss of (EURO)257mln 
versus the market's prediction of a loss of (EURO)283mln.
BT , airlines and oilers among blue-chip bonanza in coming week
Meanwhile, UBS is forecasting fiscal first-quarter revenues of around (EURO)225mln for Wizz Air Holdings 
(AIM:WIZZ) PLC when it updates on Wednesday, up from (EURO)91mln a year earlier and well above the 
consensus forecast of (EURO)189mln.
UBS's forecast is based on the assumption that traffic levels will be at least more than 25% of pre-pandemic levels 
in the same quarter of 2019.
Games Workshop to (war)hammer home profit jump
Warhammer maker Games Workshop Group PLC (LSE:GAW) will release its final results on Tuesday in what is 
expected to be a positive affair following the company's upbeat trading update in May.
The company said previously that its profits for the year to end May 2021 will be more than £150mln, a rise of 
almost 70% on the previous year, while revenues are expected to be not less than £350mln, up from £270mln in 
2019.
Investors are also heading for a heft payday, with the company's total dividend for the year due to hit 235p per 
share compared to 145p the year before.
With the figures for the year expected to be bumper ones, the key point of interest is likely to be the firm's outlook 
statement and whether its strong growth run could be side-tracked by the reopening of the economy and easing of 
lockdown restrictions, meaning people are less likely to be staying at home playing and painting Warhammer 
figurines.
Blue-chip banks in focus
Bank results season is upon us and most of the lenders should be chipper now that the banking authorities have 
taken off the limiter on dividend payments.
As per usual, the banks have also taken pity on the City by spreading their results announcements out, starting with 
Barclays on Wednesday.
UBS is forecasting second-quarter adjusted profit before tax of £1.8bn "in a result in which capital market revenues, 
loan loss overlay write-backs and restructuring charges will likely distort headline numbers".
UBS is predicting the CET1 ratio - a measure of balance sheet strength - will be 14.4%, including the exclusion of 
capitalised software intangibles.
Retail investors' favourite Lloyds Banking Group (LSE:LLOY) PLC is expected to post a second-quarter adjusted 
profit before tax of £1.45bn and a CET1 of 16.6%.
In the past, the company has been a favourite of income investors and shareholders would probably like at least a 
nod and a wink as to how high the dividend is likely to be and how soon Lloyds can return to the ranks of the FTSE 
100's top dividend payers but it has been suggested that with Charlie Nunn not having been in the chief executive's 
role for long he will be reluctant to change too much too soon.
NatWest Group (LSE:NWG) PLC is also issuing second-quarter results and the expectation is for adjusted profit 
before tax of some £935mln and CET1 of 18.1%.
The government recently indicated it would sell off another chunk of shares in the nationalised bank, which could 
either mean things are going well or the government is cashing in while it can.
Given the strength of the housing market and the relatively low level (so far) of loan defaults, it is probably more a 
case of the former.
BAT hopes to spark interest with results
BT , airlines and oilers among blue-chip bonanza in coming week
Lucky Strike and Pall Mall owner British American Tobacco PLC (LSE:BATS) reports its half-year results on 
Wednesday, with the number likely to be highly anticipated by investors after the firm's better than expected trading 
update in June.
Despite the increasing pressure on the tobacco industry from regulators and a somewhat lukewarm take-up of next-
generation products (NGPs), BAT has managed to keep growing its dividend and pay down its debts. It has also 
seen sales accelerate of its own NGPs, namely its Vuse, Vype and glo brands.
The firm's CEO Jack Bowles has also flagged up improving cigarette volumes in emerging markets and better 
market share in developed jurisdictions, so shareholders will be hoping these trends continue into the rest of the 
year and beyond.
In the numbers themselves, consensus is expecting first-half sales of £12bn, down from £12.2bn a year ago, and 
an adjusted operating profit of £5.2bn compared to £5.4bn last year.
A dividend of 53.9p will also be expected, in keeping with the group's strategy of paying 215.6p per share in 
dividends and distributing around two-thirds of its profits.
Shell to be confirmed most profitable major
Like BP, Royal Dutch Shell (LSE:RDSA) Plc is also doing lots of talking and planning around its 'transition'.
At the same time, it is arguably positioned best to capitalise on recently strong oil prices.
Indeed, in a preview note, UBS called it the "most profitable of the majors".
UBS - which rates Shell as a 'buy' with a 1,860p - expects the oiler to report US$5.5bn of net income which would 
mark a 28% improvement quarter-on-quarter.
"We expect Shell to retain its position as the most profitable of the majors," the Swiss bank said in the note. 
"Whether it is also the most cash generative is likely to be dependent on the level of working capital build this 
quarter but we fully expect underlying CFFO generation to be the best as well."
BT calls in with update
BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) (LON:BT.A) is due to deliver a trading update on Thursday as investors keep a wary eye 
on the telecom giant's operating trends amid the pressures of the pandemic, competition and regulatory changes.
For the first quarter, analysts at UBS are expecting some improvement for the firm as the effects of the pandemic 
reduce, although they added that revenues are likely to remain under pressure.
Despite this, analysts said they expected earnings to be helped by cost savings and accounting effects, predicting 
earnings (EBITDA) of £1.8bn for the quarter and revenues of £5.15bn.
Can the gap widen between FTSE's drug giants?
GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LSE:GSK) on Wednesday and AstraZeneca PLC (LSE:AZN) on Thursday are due to release 
their first-half results.
GSK's numbers follow last month's big strategy rejig, where under-pressure boss Emma Walmsley as well as 
adding some details on the planned demerger next year of GSK Consumer Healthcare, unveiled new goals 
including lifting sales 5% a year on over the next decade, ramping up operating profit margins above 30% from the 
current mid-20s, and generating £10bn of cash generation over the next five years.
BT , airlines and oilers among blue-chip bonanza in coming week
The dividend will be a "sacrificial victim", in the words of financial analyst Danni Hewson at AJ Bell, as it is expected 
to drop to 80p a share in 2022 from the company in its current guise to 55p a share across 'New' GSK and 'New' 
Consumer Healthcare.
For the half-year, investors and analysts will be focusing on any changes to current guidance for an EPS decline of 
the current year of a "mid-to-high single-digit percentage", plus developments in the key areas of vaccines (after 
missing out on the big Covid one) and speciality medicines, plus infectious diseases, HIV, oncology and 
immunology/respiratory, with a drug pipeline that currently contains 20 vaccines and 42 medicines. 
AstraZeneca, its more successful rival in recent years with a £40bn-plus market cap gap over its former superior, is 
sure to update full-year guidance after recently completing its acquisition of Alexion, with analysts at UBS expecting 
around 40 US cents to current EPS guidance of US$4.75-5.00.
"It is possible the guidance range will be wider," the UBS analysts added, though they do not expect a hidden 
deteriorating outlook.
"Top-line momentum remains key for investors as well as its growth drivers: Tagrisso, Lynparza and Imfinzi. 
Calquence uptake will also be of interest especially after we saw the topline data of the head-to-head trial with 
Imbruvica."
Investors will also be looking for comment on further Covid-19 impact and the group's China business given the 
China volume-based procurement (VBP) and Beijing's National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) hit sales for a 
number of drugs in the first quarter.
BA owner IAG hopes for recovery after turbulent year
Half-year results from British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG) SA are unlikely to 
make for great reading as coronavirus travel restrictions continue to be a millstone around the neck of the travel 
industry.
However, investors will likely be hoping the easing of restrictions, albeit slightly, will lift the firm's fortunes across the 
rest of the year, so the outlook statement will therefore be crucial as well as the group's ongoing cost management.
With this in mind, analysts at UBS are predicting the focus to be on forward bookings and the impact of the UK's 
traffic light system, as well as on the current rate of cash burn.
Macro matters
The week's key macro focus is going to be on the Fed meeting along with US GDP on Thursday and PCE indices 
on Friday, plus a range of other US data that could move the market.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the rate-setting body of the US central bank, meets on Wednesday,
"The FOMC is bound to discuss the appropriate timing for tapering down their $120bn-a-month bond purchases, 
but they're not likely to be in any rush to make a decision, IMHO," says market analyst Marshall Gittler at BDSwiss.
At their last meeting on June 16, the Fed committee determined that reaching the standard of "substantial further 
progress" was still some way off, but that they expect progress to continue.
Since then, June jobs numbers were "good but not great", but inflation is well over the 2% target, so Gittler 
wondered if the FOMC can still have confidence in their view that inflation is "transitory".
While an optimistic outlook on the US economy can be expected, Gittler added.
"They are however likely to remain cautious because of the alarming spread of the delta variant of the virus. One 
hopes though that with most of the vulnerable over-60s cohort vaccinated, hospitalizations and deaths won't rise at 
BT , airlines and oilers among blue-chip bonanza in coming week
anything near the increase in new cases and the US can continue to open up. This is one of the main reasons why I 
think the 'let's wait' crowd is likely to prevail."
Big week for US earnings as Tesla, Apple, Amazon etc report
After Monday's closing bell it's Tesla results time, with Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) another well-known name on the 
day.
Things heat up on Tuesday as the US$2trn companies in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp both 
report after the bell, along with close-behind Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), the owner of Google. There are also a 
number of big names reporting across various sectors including McDonald's Corp, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) 
Corp, Texas Instruments Inc (NYSE:TXN), 3M and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).
On Wednesday it's billion-dollar Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), along with Visa (NYSE:V) Inc, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) 
Inc, Qualcomm, Boeing, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Ford Motor Co.
Thursday brings Amazon.com Inc and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Intel, Altria, Newmont 
Mining, KKR and Hershey.
The Wall Street week finishes with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) Inc, together with big names 
including Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co, ExxonMobil Corp, Caterpillar, Chevron and Pinterest.
Starting with Tesla, recent production numbers came in ahead of expectations, showing Tesla navigated the 
computer-chip shortages that have hit the wider industry well. However, tighter supply chains, a changing product 
mix and increasing competition in the electric car market will also "spark extra interest in any comments on the 
outlook for future deliveries - particularly in China where local competitors have been ramping up sales", says 
analyst Nick Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown.
For Microsoft, analysts at broker Wedbush is expecting a robust performance from its Azure cloud product: "We 
expect another 'beat and raise' special from Redmond with Azure growth numbers (45%+ YoY) that exceed whisper 
expectations and headline numbers that comfortably exceed the Street's $44bn and $1.90 estimate."
As for Apple, where the Street is looking for US$73bn revenues and US$1.00 of earnings, Wedbush says both 
measures "look likely conservative given the underlying iPhone strength we saw during the quarter with a particular 
uptick in demand out of China". The big deal is the iPhone 13 launch expected in September, where supply chain 
checks put iPhone production at 130-150mln units and "this positive outlook gives us enhanced confidence that 
2021's launch timing will be "normal'," said analyst Dan Ives.
Looking at Alphabet, investors will be looking for the Mountain View search behemoth to show continued 
momentum in its Google search and advertising products, plus signs of the cloud division becoming a contender 
against the runaway market leaders of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
As for Facebook, it has been a pandemic winner and as a result the group will have a hard time besting its 2020 
first-half results, says analyst Laura Hoy at Hargreaves, with monthly active users up 10% last quarter, but likely to 
be a bit lower as people are out and about a bit more. "However, nothing seems impossible for the social media 
giant and the world's shift to digital looks like a long-term behavioural change rather than a passing fad."

Sweden 's Amapola Flyg secures Irish PSO contract for Donegal
Sweden's Amapola Flyg secures Irish PSO contract for Donegal

Amapola Flyg (HP, Stockholm Arlanda) has been awarded the Public Service Obligation (PSO) air services contract 
for the Dublin Int'l to Donegal and vice versa route after it was left vacant following the collapse of Stobart Air (RE, 
Dublin Int'l) in June.
An Irish government statement said the Swedish regional carrier would use a Fokker 50 to run the route twice a 
day, every day effective July 26.
"I am pleased to announce that Swedish operator Amapola has been awarded the seven-month contract to operate 
on the Government-funded Donegal - Dublin PSO route," Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said. "In order to 
ensure continuity of service on the Donegal route when this temporary contract expires, I plan to launch a further 
procurement process this summer to provide for a longer-term contract of up to four years on the route."
Amapola Flyg operates a fleet of twelve Fokker Aircraft split evenly between Fokker 50 passenger props and 
Fokker 50 freighters. It currently operates seven PSO routes in Sweden and Finland.
As previously reported, Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will assume Stobart Air's other vacant Irish PSO contract - 
between Dublin and Kerry - albeit on an unsubsidised basis, effective July 28.

Budget airline Ryanair posts 273 million euro loss as Covid continues to wreak havoc
Budget airline Ryanair posts 273 million euro loss as Covid continues to 
wreak havoc

Low-cost airline Ryanair said Monday that it's still facing a "challenging" environment and that it might finish the 
fiscal year "somewhere between a small loss and breakeven" as Covid-19 restrictions linger.
The Irish firm reported a 273 million euro ($322 million) loss for the period between April and June, as lockdowns 
meant most flights over the Easter period were canceled and with European nations being cautious over the easing 
of travel restrictions. The figure beat a forecast from analysts which was compiled by the company.
In comparison, the airline posted a 185 million euro loss over the same first-quarter period a year ago.
"Covid-19 continued to wreak havoc on our business," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement Monday.
At the same time, operating costs also increased, deteriorating the company's balance sheet. Over the year to 
June, costs rose by 116%, driven mostly by fuel, airport and route charges.
However, O'Leary expects traffic to pick up in the coming weeks.
"We expect traffic to rise from over 5 million in June to almost 9 million in July, and over 10 million in August, as 
long as there are no further Covid setbacks in Europe," he said.
However, the outlook is highly dependent on the pandemic and successful vaccination campaigns. According to 
Our World in Data, in the European Union 46% of the adult population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. In the 
U.K., that number is 54.4%.
Ryanair shares are up 42% from a year ago. They traded 2.5% higher in early European deals Monday on the back 
of the results.
"Ryanair is still at the mercy of the virus and, although a recovery is materializing, the group noted that travel within 
Europe will be depressed for the foreseeable future," Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said via 
email.
"We're encouraged by the group's progress, but it may have to toe the precarious line between low fares and high 
costs for some time."

Ryanair Losses Widen On Covid Travel Restrictions

Jul 26, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Irish no-frills airline Ryanair on Monday announced a widening of losses in its first quarter, hit by Covid travel 
restrictions in Europe. 
Losses after tax hit 272.6 million euros ($321 million) in the group's first quarter, or three months to June 30. 
That compared with a net loss of 185.1 million euros one year earlier for the Dublin-based carrier that flies mainly 
throughout Europe. 
"Covid-19 continued to wreak havoc on our business during the first quarter with most Easter flights cancelled and 
a slower-than-expected easing of EU government travel restrictions into May and June," Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said in the company's earnings statement. 
Costs more than doubled in its first quarter, offsetting a near trebling of revenues. 
Traveller numbers however soared to 8.1 million from just half-a-million one year earlier. 
And Ryanair was experiencing a "strong rebound of pent up travel demand into August and September", noted 
O'Leary, adding that the airline expects the rebound to continue. 
 "We are encouraged by the high rate of vaccinations across Europe," he said. 
"If, as is presently predicted, most of Europe's adult population is fully vaccinated by September, then we believe 
that we can look forward to a strong recovery in air travel for the second half of the fiscal year." 
Fierce European rival EasyJet last week ramped up its summer capacity and revealed narrowing losses on 
improving demand.

Elsewhere Monday, London's Heathrow airport announced that its losses from the pandemic had reached ?2.9 
billion ($4.0 billion, 3.4 billion euros). 
"The UK is emerging from the worst effects of the health pandemic, but is falling behind its EU rivals in international 
trade by being slow to remove restrictions," said Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye. 
With travel restrictions easing however, Ryanair earlier this month announced plans to hire more than 2,000 pilots. 
At the start of the pandemic, it had slashed 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15 percent of staff, mirroring moves 
by airlines globally to save cash in the face of collapsing demand. 
Ryanair had in May posted an annual net loss of 1.0 billion euros as the pandemic grounded planes. 
Ryanair Losses Widen On Covid Travel Restrictions
Ryanair's latest results "painted a rosy picture of the future for European air travel as vaccination passports open 
the door to a summer travel season", noted Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. 
"However, despite an influx of travellers, Ryanair's losses widened over the past three months.. Ticket prices, on 
the other hand, were depressed." 
Shares in Ryanair rose 3.3 percent to 16.26 euros in morning deals following the results.

       European stocks fell in cautious trade on Monday after a government crackdown pushed China stocks to their 
worst day in a year and a survey showed German business confidence weakened unexpectedly in July.
 German business sentiment index fell to 100.8 in July from a revised 101.7 in June, the ifo Institute said. The score 
was forecast to rise to 102.1 from June's initially estimated value of 101.8.
 Rising COVID-19 infections also dented sentiment, with Russia's total virus cases surpassing 6 million and Turkey 
reporting a tripling of cases on Sunday compared with earlier this month.
 The key event of the week for markets is the Fed meeting, where investors will look for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's 
comments on inflation and interest rates.
 On the earnings front, more than one third of S&P 500 companies are set to unveil their quarterly earnings this 
week, headlined by Facebook, Tesla, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon.com.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 slipped 0.3 percent to 459.93 after climbing 1.1 percent on Friday. The German DAX 
dropped 0.6 percent, France's CAC 40 index eased 0.4 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was down 0.3 percent.
 Dutch technology investor Prosus, which has a 28.9 percent stake in Tencent Holdings, plunged almost 10 percent 
after Beijing intensified its regulatory crackdown on the Chinese internet giant.
 Koninklijke Philips lost 3.1 percent after reporting a fall in second-quarter net profit.
 Credit Suisse was marginally lower after the Swiss banking giant said it reached an out-of-court settlement with its 
former wealth-management executive over allegations of spying.
 ABB was little changed after reports it is in advanced talks to sell its mechanical power transmission business to 
RBC Bearings Inc.
 Faurecia shares declined 4 percent despite the French car parts maker posting higher first-half sales and profit, 
and upgrading its 2021 cash flow target.
 Lower yields pulled down banks, with Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank and HSBC Holdings falling around 1 percent.
 Strong base metal prices helped lift miners, with Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore rising about 1 percent 
each.
 Low-cost carrier Ryanair jumped 3.6 percent. The company lifted its full-year traffic forecasts after reporting a 
smaller-than-expected first quarter loss.
 Drug maker AstraZeneca, which recently completed its $39-billion acquisition of Alexion, fell about 1 percent.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said at best it expects to achieve a breakeven in its current 
financial year, as it saw signs of recovery in the first quarter on easing lockdown restrictions in the EU and the UK. 
The Irish budget airline said traffic rebounded to 8.1 million in the three months to June 30 from 500,000 a year 
before, as capacity recovered in May and June. As a result, revenue nearly tripled in the quarter to EUR370.5 
million from EUR125.2 million a year earlier. 
Scheduled revenue grew by 91% year-on-year to EUR192 million, while ancillary revenue - generated from goods 
or services not including tickets - performed well, generating EUR22 per passenger, as more guests choose priority 
boarding and reserved seating.  
Ryanair said it saw operating costs more than doubling to EUR675 million in the first quarter from EUR312.8 million, 
driven primarily by variable costs such as fuel, airport & handling and route charges.
The company's pretax loss widened to EUR324.5 million from EUR210.0 million year-on-year. 
Going forward, the company said its current financial year is expected to be challenging, with Covid-19 travel 
restrictions prolonging uncertainty. Following the July 1 rollout of EU Digital Covid Certificate and the relaxation of 
the UK's quarantine rules for those who are fully-vaccinated, the company said it has seen second-quarter bookings 
recover strongly, albeit at low fares.
Ryanair said it believes that full-year traffic has improved to a range of 90 million to 100 million from the previously 
guided 80 million to 120 million passenger range, and the company said it expects that the likely outcome for the 
year to the end of March 2022 is "somewhere between a small loss and breakeven".

Looking ahead, Ryanair expects fiscal 2022 traffic to improve to a range of 90 million to 100 million passengers

 Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY), an ultra-low cost airline, announced Monday that it may end the fiscal year 
'somewhere between a small loss and breakeven' amid the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions in Europe. The firm's 
losses after tax amounted to USD322 Million during its first quarter. 
 'COVID-19 continued to wreak havoc on our business during the first quarter with most Easter flights cancelled and 
a slower-than-expected easing of EU government travel restrictions into May and June,' Ryanair CEO Michael 
O'Leary said in a statement Monday. 
 Simultaneously, operating costs have surged affecting the company's finances even more. Throughout the year to 
June, expenses increased 116%, greatly attributed to fuel, airport and route costs. 
 Nevertheless, travellers surged to 8.1 Million, compared to the previous year's half-a-million. Ryanair was seeing a 
'strong rebound of pent up travel demand into August and September', according to O'Leary, which he expects will 
continue. 
 'We are encouraged by the high rate of vaccinations across Europe,' he said. 
 'If, as is presently predicted, most of Europe's adult population is fully vaccinated by September, then we believe 
that we can look forward to a strong recovery in air travel for the second half of the fiscal year.' 
 The forecast is heavily reliant on the pandemic and positive vaccination campaigns. Our World in Data revealed 
that 46% of adults in the European Union are now fully vaccinated against Covid as well as 54.4% adults in the U.K. 
 Ryanair shares have risen 42% compared to the previous year and traded 2.5% higher in European deals Monday. 
 'Ryanair is still at the mercy of the virus and, although a recovery is materializing, the group noted that travel within 
Europe will be depressed for the foreseeable future,' Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in an 
email.

 Ryanair is expecting to fly 100 million passengers during this financial year after a surge in summer bookings in 
recent weeks, although it warned that it does not expect to make a profit this year. 
The Irish airline increased its passenger forecast to 90-100 million for the 12 months to the end of March 2022, 
thanks to the coronavirus vaccination programme and the easing of some travel restrictions. 
 It expects to carry larger numbers of passengers over the summer, almost doubling from 5 million in June to almost 
9 million in July, and reaching 10 million in August, provided there are no further setbacks as a result of Covid-19. 
 However, the company cautioned that it expected to make a small loss or to just break even during the year to 
March, as it reported that it remained in the red in first quarter of the financial year. 
 Ryanair reported a loss of €273m (234m) for three months to the end of June and said that Covid had continued to 
'wreak havoc' on its business during the period, when most Easter flights were cancelled and there was a slower 
than expected easing of travel restrictions from EU governments. 
 The low-cost carrier flew 8.1 million people from April to June this year, up from only 500,000 in 2020, although its 
losses increased by almost half, up from the €185m loss reported a year earlier. 
 Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said: 'Significant uncertainty around travel green lists (particularly in the 
UK) and extreme government caution in Ireland meant that Q1 bookings were close-in and at low fares. 
 'The 1 July rollout of EU digital Covid certificates (DCC) and the scrapping of quarantine for vaccinated arrivals to 
the UK from mid-July has seen a surge in bookings over recent weeks.' 
 The airline said ticket prices remained lower than pre-Covid levels and it is focusing on the recovery of traffic and 
tourism across its European network during the summer. 
 The announcement came only days after Ryanair said it was aiming to recruit 2,000 pilots over the next three years 
as it tries to rebuild its passenger numbers after the pandemic. 
 The airline has also started to take delivery of its first Boeing 737 Max aircraft and has ordered more than 200 of 
the planes. 
 Ryanair has labelled the Boeing aircraft a 'gamechanger' because of its better fuel efficiency and seat capacity, 
compared with its existing fleet. 
Ryanair forecasts 100m passengers in financial year as bookings soar
 While Ryanair and the aviation sector have been hit hard during the pandemic, the airline believes it is well 
positioned to benefit from the difficulties of its rivals during the crisis, which has resulted in the collapse of European 
competitors.

On May 23, the Belarusian authorities forced the landing of a Ryanair passenger plane with a pro-democratic 
Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich, using a military jet and a false bomb alarm. The forcible landing 
was intended to arrest the activist and his partner Sophia Sapiega. Both Belarusian and Russian authorities went to 
great lengths to spread disinformation about the event. 
DebunkEU.org experts analyzed problematic information flow in a short period after the event May 23-30th. 
Analysts reviewed 300 selected articles on the issues and detected 219 articles (more than 73%), that were 
identified as disinformation. 
Detected disinformation has potentially reached almost 155 million contacts. Numbers prove that topic was 
important for both audience and hostile media outlets. 
Day after the event, pro-Kremlin media outlets copied false statements of Belarusian authorities stating that the 
forced plane landing was conducted accordingly to international laws. However, after the harsh reaction of the 
West, this narrative was muted and was not used that often. 
Despite the short delay of pro-Kremlin media reaction on this event, Russian state-funded media sources aligned 
their stories on the situation with Belarus undemocratic regime and stance and strived to develop a story hand in 
hand with the portrayal of the story in Belarus disinformation outlets. 
 Top narratives concerning the forced landing in Minsk, 23-30 May, 2021 
One plane and a lot of noise. Pro-Kremlin disinformation about forced landing in Minsk
 Through the whole week 23-30 of May, the major message which was spread across the misleading outlets 
attacked representative of pro-democratic opposition Mr Protasievich, claiming that he is a terrorist, dangerous 
extremist, or follower of Nazi ideology. The common use of this narrative aimed to justify the operation. 
 Timeline of creation of harmful narratives 
 Western criticism provoked establishment of new narratives against EU countries and US. Some of them were 
connected to Mr Protasievich stating that he worked for foreign intelligence form countries like Poland or Lithuania 
and was planning to conduct coup in Belarus. In such narratives West countries were portrayed as interfering in 
Belarus internal affairs. Other messages undermined the effort of West to transparently cover the story. The articles 
accused Western countries in politicising the situation as well as reacting hysterically. 
 Sources by the share of published articles 
 The analysis showed a great diversification of Russian language media sources spreading disinformation on this 
topic. Such trend suggests that it was important for Kremlin media to maintain extensive coverage of the topic in 
various channels in order to not only Belarusian version of event but also to ground it in wider audience. 
To present disinformation on the issue technique of association were used very often. Disinformation within the 
association technique predominantly was complemented and reinforced with the statements of Russia's officials 
and other statesmen. It suggests that Russia's officials are active participators of spreading disinformation and they 
legitimize disinformation messages.

US airlines are returning to profitability faster than European counterparts thanks to generous aid, a much larger 
domestic market and a relatively quick vaccines rollout.
Three of the four big US carriers reported a profit in the second quarter. United, which recorded a quarterly loss, 
said it expected to return to profitability in the second half.
The speedy recovery stands in contrast to Europe, where airlines have racked up record losses.
Dan Akins, an economist at Flight path Economics, said US airlines travelled "a great deal more" in their domestic 
market, whereas European carriers had to contend with "international boundary issues".
US airlines also benefited from billions of dollars of direct government support for the industry, whereas many 
European carriers did not receive targeted aid beyond furlough schemes intended for the wider economy.
Doug Parker, American chief executive, said on Thursday that the mix of grants and low-interest loans made 
available to the industry had been "an overwhelming success".
The payroll support program meant airlines could keep more workers employed during the pandemic, allowing them 
to add capacity rapidly when demand returned.

Parker said: "Had it not been for PSP, you would not see airlines trying to grow, like we are, 45 per cent in a 
quarter. You'd see airlines shut down. I can't imagine how horrific it would be ... not just for the airline industry but 
for our entire economy" if they had not had access to PSP.
Ed Bastian, Delta chief executive, said this month that the return of US travellers was a tribute to the scientists who 
developed the vaccines that would "be key to opening the world".
Delta reported $652m in net income in the second quarter, followed by $348m at Southwest and $19m at American. 
All three posted losses without the aid that, for the three of them since the start of the crisis, totals $43bn.
United reported a $434m net loss, but the company said that with robust demand it would generate adjusted pretax 
income in the second half.
"We don't just see the light at the end of the tunnel, we're exiting the tunnel," Scott Kirby, chief executive, said.
European carriers have been hobbled by small domestic markets and tough, oft-changing curbs.
This week easyJet reported a quarterly pre-tax loss of £318m, taking its losses for the first three quarters of its fiscal 
year past £1bn.
The handful of carriers that reported a profit, such as Turkish, tapped a boom in air freight.
Investors see Ryanair and Wizz as best placed to recover quickly from the crisis.

Boris Johnson's reopening plans face several major tests this weekend as events reopen across the country for the 
first time since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced in March last year.
Festivals in particular are now able to go ahead with the Latitude event in Suffolk this weekend expected to attract 
40,000 people.
Early arrivals yesterday had to show proof of two vaccinations or a negative Covid-19 test to get in but social 
distancing measures are not in place in the trial event and there is no requirement for facemasks, though marquees 
will be open-sided or equipped with air purifiers.
A huge weekend for travel is also expected with the start of the summer school holidays expected to spark a mass 
exodus to the sun.
The getaway comes as infections continue to rise across the country with almost 750,000 people testing positive 
over the past week.
Even so, an estimated 400,000 people are expected to travel over the weekend in what is expected to be the first 
mass holiday break since pandemic lockdown restrictions were introduced.
Airlines are putting on more flights
UK reopening plans face critical test as summer starts in earnest
"With schools breaking up for summer this weekend sees the busiest weekend so far this year and we are looking 
forward to taking as many people as we can on that long-awaited and well-deserved trip," said Ali Gayward, 
easyJet's UK manager, said in a statement.
The airline is preparing to carry over 135,000 passengers this weekend from the UK on over 80 routes to Green 
and Amber destinations across Europe.
Jet2 has 100 more flights taking off this weekend than last week with 40 destinations now on its schedule.
Airports, too, are braced for a surge of holidaymakers with Heathrow Airport expecting almost 130,000 passengers 
this weekend.
"We're thrilled to see the terminals coming to life again, with most of the shops and restaurants now reopened. We 
have additional colleagues on hand to ensure our passengers have a smooth journey," said John Holland-Kaye, 
chief executive.
Reports today that France might be downgraded again to no-quarantine status, having been moved up the amber-
list plus category only last weekend also helped the mood.
Trade association ABTA said today it wants more countries to be added to the green list to boost travel abroad and 
also for testing requirements to be eased while adding that it was essential financial support for the travel industry 
continues.
Shares in airlines have had a tough week but were edging up again today with easyJet 1% better at 818p, Ryanair 
PLC (LON:RYA) 0.5% higher at (EURO)15.90 and JET2 PLC (LON:JET2) a couple of pence higher at 1,149p.

 Spain's highest court on Friday said Ryanair's (RYA.L) practice of sending luggage on a different flight from the

In addition, the Supreme Court again ruled that the airline charging 40 euros ($47.05) to reprint boarding passes is 
void.

How Warren Buffett Turned Three Deep Value Stocks Into A $700 Billion Conglomerate 
It took decades for Warren Buffett to build Berkshire Hathaway into the conglomerate it is today. Along the way, the 
Oracle of Omaha and his business partners have acquired a range of different companies and extracted cash from 
failing businesses to reinvest back into growth stocks. Q2 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more The

Look Ahead To Q2 Earnings: Tesla , Ryanair , LVMH And More
 'With production coming in ahead of expectations Tesla[7] has clearly navigated the computer-chip shortages that 
have hit the wider industry well. However, tighter supply chains together with changing product mix (Model 3/Y 
deliveries continue to grow while premium Model S/X sales fall) mean margins will be the main area of focus once 
again. Increasing competition in the electric car market will also spark extra interest in any comments on the outlook 
for future deliveries - particularly in China where local competitors have been ramping up sales. That extra 
competition could also undermine the group's lucrative line in selling carbon credits to other manufacturers. While 
we don't see a collapse in credit revenues as imminent, any suggestion this crucial source of cash is under threat 
would raise questions about whether Tesla can fund future expansion without further shareholder support.' 
Ryanair, Q1 Trading Statement, Monday 26 July 
Laura Hoy, Equity Analyst  
 'The big question for Ryanair[8] is whether it is still on track to breakeven for the current financial year. The group 
said it would avoid another loss in the 2022 financial year if travel restarted between July and September. However, 
the yo-yo restrictions over the past few months have added some turbulence to the sector. We're keen to see how 
Ryanair's responded to the uncertainty and whether it will be enough to push profits into the black. Capacity and 
passenger numbers in the current quarter will be top of mind as we work out whether Ryanair will be able to make 
good on its ambition to breakeven. We suspect they won't be quite as strong as the group had been hoping. But 
with internal EU travel flowing more freely, it should be enough to piece together something of a summer travel 
season. We've also seen peers like easyJet aim to capitalise on travellers' willingness to pay more for things like 
additional baggage and priority boarding. We'd like to see Ryanair pounce on this trend as well, particularly 
because roughly a third of the group's passenger revenue comes from spend on extras.' 
LVMH, Interim Results, Monday 26 July 
Susannah Streeter, Senior Investment and Markets Analyst  
 ''Steering the big LVMH ship through the pandemic has been far from plain sailing for management, but overall, the 
group has weathered the storm admirably. Even though some shops have remain shut in many markets, and all-
important tourist numbers are low, sales still thrived in the first quarter. It's not just testament to the group's online 
strength, but its 24-carat brand. Even when socialising opportunities have been limited, wealthy shoppers have 
shown they still want to reward themselves with high end treats. After a bitter spat over the price of the acquisition, 
LVMH has also now welcomed Tiffany with open arms, heralding the prestigious arrival of the American jeweller to 
its luxury stable. However, the deal came with a hefty dose of debt, so sales trajectories here will be a key metric to 
watch. With worries about new Covid variants swirling there will also be concern that international travel will not 
rebound as quickly as hoped, and with LVMH somewhat reliant on well-heeled tourists splashing the cash, this is 
likely to act as a drag on sales for some time.'' 
Moonpig, Full Year Results, Tuesday 27 July 
Susannah Streeter, Senior Investment and Markets Analyst 
 ''Moonpig flew into the FTSE 250 at the June reshuffle after rooting out a hefty valuation at its IPO launch. The 
company had been living high on the hog during the pandemic as demand for cards and personalised gifts ordered 
online soared. But the easing of shopping restrictions mean consumers are now free to browse real rather than 
virtual piles of cards once more,and there are concerns its flying sales may have come down to earth with a bump. 
Reflecting those worries, the share price has fallen by a fifth since reaching a high at the beginning of June. By 
positioning itself as a digital sales platform, using data to predict consumer preferences, Moonpig seemed to have 
succeeded in positioning itself as a big e-commerce player, rather than an online card retailer. But whether it can 
capitalise on those data sets to boost sales of other ranges is far from clear.'' 
Microsoft, Q4 Trading Statement, Tuesday 27 July 
Steve Clayton, Manager of the UK Select Funds 
 'Microsoft[9] report on their Q4 trading on Tuesday. All eyes are likely to be on its Azure cloud computing division 
where growth has been extraordinarily strong in recent quarters.' 
Alphabet, Q2 Trading Statement, Tuesday 27 July 
Steve Clayton, Manager of the UK Select Funds 
 'Alphabet[10] needs to show that momentum in its core Google Search and Advertising products remains buoyant 
to support the strong performance the stock has put on so far this year. Can the company show any signs of their 
Google Cloud division becoming a serious contender against the runaway market leaders of Amazon Web Services 
and Microsoft Azure?' 
ITV, Interim Results, Wednesday 28 July 
Look Ahead To Q2 Earnings: Tesla , Ryanair , LVMH And More
Susannah Streeter, Senior Investment and Markets Analyst 
 'ITV[11] is trying to change channels to make the business less reliant on advertising as a driver for growth. 
Developing its Studios arm which creates content for other platforms and channels is a big part of this strategy. But 
the move is taking time, not least because of the production setback brought on by Covid and any update on 
progress will be one to watch. The recent share price plunge, off the back of concerns about new variants causing a 
drag on the recovery, demonstrates why the pivot is so important. Sentiment is highly sensitive to any factors which 
could affect ad revenues. The picture remains fuzzy regarding the impact this current spike of infections will have 
for the economy, but overall advertising revenue has been recovering. ITV's schedule is looking brighter with the 
return of big shows like Love Island following cancellations during the pandemic.'' 
McDonald's, Q2 Results, Wednesday 28 July 
Sophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst  
 'Overall revenue and profit beat expectations last quarter, partly thanks to a strong performance from the key US 
market[12], where comparable store sales rose 13.6%. That's set the bar high heading into next week's results, and 
we wonder if the strong run can be continued. A quick way to check this will be looking at whether the group still 
expects full-year sales growth in the mid-teens, and operating margins in the low-to-mid 40% range. We have 
reason to hope sales have remained robust in core markets. The group managed a rapid increase in digital and 
delivery options in the last few years, and this could be a long-term shift in customer behaviour accelerated by 
COVID. What's less clear is what the overall picture will be. Restrictions have lifted at different rates across the 
globe, and that means we're probably in for an eclectic mix of regional results. Finally, we'll be looking out for any 
updates on the growth strategy. There are some vague platitudes in the current plan, and we'd like a bit more detail, 
or at least a better idea of when we can expect it.' 
Facebook, Q2 Results, Wednesday 28 July 
Laura Hoy, Equity Analyst  
 'Facebook[13] has been a pandemic winner and a result he group will have a hard time besting its 2020 first-half 
results. However, nothing seems impossible for the social media giant and the world's shift to digital looks like a 
long-term behavioural change rather than a passing fad. The second quarter should see revenue growth slow 
significantly from the 46% increase in the first quarter, but even just maintaining some of the pandemic-driven 
momentum would be impressive. The driving force behind revenue will be advertising spend, itself a reflection of 
the size of Facebook's active user base. The group was able to grow Monthly Active Users by 10% last quarter, but 
we suspect that could be a bit lower as people are out and about a bit more. Advertising prices saw a double digit 
increase last quarter and we'd like to see that trend continue without knocking volume growth. Continued revenue 
growth is important because the group's spending has been on the rise recently as it works to build out its data 
centres and keep up with the ever-changing tech landscape. Those dollars are also destined to go somewhere else 
though—the legal and corporate affairs departments. While the group won the first round of lawsuits, which alleged 
the company had become an unfair monopoly, the Biden administration is likely to continue pursuing a break-up. 
We'd like to hear Facebook's take on the ordeal and get a sense of how much they think the battle, sure to be years 
long, will cost.' 
Dr Martens, Q1 Trading Statement, Thursday 29 July 
Susannah Streeter, Senior Investment and Markets Analyst 
 ''Dr Martens, made famous for dressing punk and grunge fans had a city style makeover with a successful IPO[14], 
but the shine has come off the bootmaker recently. Although its revenues are still forecast to grow at a double-digit 
pace, guidance shows they are unlikely to match the sales sprint the company saw in 2020, thanks to a 70% surge 
in e-commerce. Standard sizing of its iconic designs means it is likely to continue to benefit from a lower return rate, 
which should hold up margins. But with shoppers free to try on other rival brands, the fresh completion may stomp 
on its sales. The brand will be also sensitive to future fashion trends. It may now be basking in the style spotlight 
with the grunge look back in mode, but fashion is fickle and that could reflect in its share price down the line. 
Widening its footprint of styles is likely to be the path trodden in the future, but that also risks diluting the core 
brand.'' 
Compass Group, Q3 Trading Statement, Thursday 29 July 
Steve Clayton, Manager of the UK Select Funds 
 'Compass Group is one of the market's core 'reopening plays' and investors will be all ears as to what they have to 
say about the pace of employees, students and fans returning to the canteens which the group operate across the 
USA and beyond.' 
Look Ahead To Q2 Earnings: Tesla , Ryanair , LVMH And More
AB InBev, Q2 Trading Statement, Thursday 29 July 
William Ryder, Equity Analyst 
 'Brewing giant AB InBev must be looking nervously at the UK's Covid numbers. After a year in which pubs were 
shut the brewer made a strong start to 2021, with beer volumes and revenue ahead of 2019. However, that's come 
as markets around the world reopened pubs and restaurants after a hard Covid winter. We expect the group's 
second quarter, which we will hear about next week, to have enjoyed similar momentum. But, with cases rising 
quickly in the relatively well vaccinated UK, further trading restrictions may be imposed if hospitalisations follow. By 
itself the UK is a relatively small market for a giant like AB InBev, but we could be the canary in the coalmine for 
another major wave. This makes management's outlook both interesting and somewhat unimportant. AB InBev's 
results will depend heavily on the pandemic's path over the next six months, but we still want to know how the 
group is positioning itself.' 
Intertek, Interim Results, Friday 30 July 
Steve Clayton, Manager of the UK Select Funds 
 'Intertek are a key player in facilitating global trade, and their pace of growth will be keenly watched. With a growing 
presence in supply chain assurance, Intertek are a potential beneficiary of the growing trend for ESG investing.' 
Primary Health Properties, Primary Health Properties, Friday 30 July 
Laura Hoy, Equity Analyst  
 'Primary Health Properties benefits from its location in the healthcare sector—with the NHS and Ireland's HSE 
making up the bulk of the group's tenants. For that reason, we're expecting strong rent collection to have continued 
through the second quarter. The larger question for PHP is portfolio growth and revenue growth potential. In the first 
quarter the group made just one acquisition and Covid-related disruptions kept the group from making progress on 
pipeline deals. At last check the group had 18 direct development projects at varying stages in the medium-term 
pipeline and 4 live. We're keen to know whether progress has been made to shift some of those developments 
forward. The group's Nexus acquisition is also one to watch— aside from the development opportunities that come 
with it, it's expected to generate annual cost savings of 4m and we'd like to know if it's on track to meet that goal. 
Finally, the group's loan-to-value ratio has been creeping higher, rising nearly a full percentage point to 41.9% over 
the past year. This could become an issue if interest rates rise, so it's worth keeping an eye on.'

Highlight: The London High Court in the UK has turned down the legal challenge filed by Manchester Airports 
Group (MAG) and other airline companies against the UK Government's traffic lights system for travellers entering 
Britain.
Body
In June, MAG in the UK reportedly partnered with Irish airline company Ryanair to launch a legal action against the 
government over the travel traffic light system. The complaint was filed against the Department for Transport and 
the Department of Health and Social Care. This legal challenge sought more transparency on how the countries are 
being classified by the government. The litigation, led by MAG, was also supported by British Airways owner IAG, 
TUI, Easyjet and Virgin Atlantic in addition to Ryanair. In their appeal to the court, airports and airline companies 
have raised concerns over the government's traffic light system, which classifies countries based on their Covid-19 
risk. They argued that the decisions were not based on data. Although the court partially accepted the argument 
against the government, the final decision was given in favour of the government. The judges said that the 
government had not acted unlawfully and will not have to make more disclosures regarding how it reaches 
decisions over its travel rules. The UK Government has welcomed the court's decision. A government spokesman 
said: "Our traffic light system continues to cautiously manage the risk of new variants as we balance the timely 
reopening of international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out."

EasyJet warns Britons are being left behind Airlines Carrier says the country's travel restrictions force it to

EasyJet warns Britons are being left behind; Airlines Carrier says the 
country's travel restrictions force it to serve continent instead

EasyJet has warned UK customers are being left behind because of travel restrictions as it increased the number of 
flights it operates over the late summer in response to a surge in bookings from continental Europe.
The low-cost carrier yesterday said it expected to operate 60 per cent of its 2019 schedule between July and 
September, up from just 17 per cent in the previous quarter.
EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren told the Financial Times: "You can definitely see Europe is leading the 
way out of this, and the UK unfortunately is falling behind."
While easyJet's business is normally split evenly between the UK and Europe, at present two-thirds of its bookings 
come from the continent.
From the start of this month, passengers from the EU can use a digital Covid-19 pass to cross borders, while the 
UK government has complex and sometimes rapidly changing rules on foreign travel.
Lundgren questioned UK travel restrictions, which are based on a traffic-light system that classifies countries by 
Covid-19 risk.
EasyJet warns Britons are being left behind Airlines Carrier says the country's travel restrictions force it to 
serve continent instead
"You have to suspect there is a different approach and different risk willingness when it comes to travel compared 
to reopening the domestic economy," Lundgren said.
"You can go into a nightclub with no restrictions whatsoever, but you can't travel to a low-risk destination to go to 
the beach without having to take expensive testing, it just doesn't make any sense."
Lundgren's criticism came as the industry lost a High Court ruling against the government in a judicial review.
The industry argued ministers had breached their duties of transparency in making public the criteria that 
determined where countries were placed on travel lists under the traffic light system.
However, the easyJet boss still expects a resurgence in travel from Britain as soon as the rules ease, and 
welcomed the government's decision to drop quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers returning from countries on 
the "amber" travel list.
Shares rose 0.9 per cent to 777p by yesterday's close, but have fallen more than a fifth over the past month as 
rising case numbers across the UK and Europe prompt concerns over travel for the rest of this year.
EasyJet is the first big European airline to report earnings this summer, and its plan to increase flights is particularly 
encouraging given that it has been more cautious in restoring capacity than some of its rivals including Ryanair and 
Wizz Air, analysts at Bernstein said.
"This should be taken as highly encouraging for the sector, and a key sign that the travel recovery is upon us," 
Bernstein said.
Chris Tarry, a London-based aviation consultant, said the cautious approach meant easyJet had been late in 
moving capacity to continental Europe to take advantage of changing passenger demand.
EasyJet posted a pre-tax loss of £318m during the three months to the end of June, only marginally less than the 
£349m it lost a year earlier when there was virtually no flying due to coronavirus curbs.
The airline has now passed more than £1bn in losses for the first three quarters of its current financial year.
However, it has managed to cut its cash burn during its third quarter to £55m, and has access to £2.9bn of liquidity, 
having raised more than £5.5bn since the start of the crisis.
The company said it would "continue to review its liquidity position on a regular basis", but did not outline any 
immediate plans to raise more cash.
A growing debt burden is expected to hang over the airline sector for years, and easyJet had about £2bn in net debt 
by the end of June, roughly flat on the previous quarter.
The company will repay a £300m Bank of England emergency Covid-19 loan in November, but will then have no 
other debt maturities outstanding until the 2023 financial year.

An attempt to sue the UK government over its travel traffic light scheme by the owner of Manchester Airport has 
been rejected in the High Court.
Manchester Airports was supported in its claim by airlines Ryanair (LON:RYA), easyJet (LON:EZJ), British Airways-
owner IAG (LON:IAG), TUI UK (LON:TUI)  and Virgin Atlantic.
The carriers suggested that the decisions on how to rate countries either red, amber or green were not based on 
data.
While some parts of the claim were upheld, the court decided that the government had not acted unlawfully and that 
it would not have to disclose all the information behind its country-rating decisions.
Airlines have been critical of the UK's travel policy for months and today slammed the decision on Friday to 
upgrade France to quarantine status and arguing instead for more countries to be put on the green list.
easyjet shifts focus to Europe as UK travel recovery stalls
EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren described Britain's policy today as senseless and unfair.
"The UK is being left behind, and the rest of Europe is opening up and unwinding," he told the Evening Standard, 
adding that the government's stance was unscientific and inconsistent.
Airlines fail in writ against UK government's traffic light scheme
"The fact that you can go into a very crowded nightclub with no face mask, no vaccination, no testing - but you can't 
lie on the beach in a destination that has proven much lower cases of infection levels than the UK... That just 
doesn't make sense."
Lundgren was speaking after another big quarterly loss for the airline that followed a slide in the value of travel 
stocks yesterday due to fears over the repercussions from a surge in Delta variant infections of Covid-19.
"If you are following the data, many more destinations in Europe should go on the green list.  Unnecessary testing 
should not be in place because it does restrict travel for millions of passengers in a way that is unfair and not 
backed up by science," added Lundgren.
EasyJet said it was seeing more bookings now in Europe than the UK now and was increasing capacity there to 
take advantage.

Malta Air (AL, Malta Int'l) took delivery of its first B737-8-200 on July 14, 2021, debuting an individual branding that 
distinguishes it from that of its sister carrier Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l). 9H-VUE (msn 65876) was ferried directly from 
Seattle Boeing Field to Dublin Int'l, where it is awaiting service entry, currently scheduled for July 20, 2021.
The carrier already operates 120 B737-800s on behalf of Ryanair all of which feature its livery. As such, the MAX 8 
marks not just operational but also a branding change for the Maltese operator.
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module indicates that five more B737-8-200s are ready for delivery Ryanair 
Holdings's Maltese carrier. The group previously confirmed that due to certification delays, it would induct just 12 
units of the type during the Summer 2021 season, split evenly between Ryanair and Malta Air. The Irish unit took 
delivery of its first B737-8-200 on June 16 and began the type's commercial operations on June 26. It has already 
inducted all six of its units of the type planned for this summer season.
In total, Ryanair Holdings has firm orders for 210 B737-8-200s. On top of the first 12 units delivered this summer, 
the group is expecting a further 50 by the beginning of the Summer 2022 season. The added jets will also deliver to 
the group's Polish unit Buzz (where they will also be the first aircraft in that carrier's dedicated branding) and to 
Ryanair UK. The only group unit not currently scheduled to take the B737 MAX is Lauda Europe, which operates 
A320-200s.
Ryanair is one of only two customers for the B737-8-200 variant, a high-density modification of the B737-8, with the 
other one being VietJetAir.

European travel demand drives EasyJet summer comeback

EasyJet plans to fly 60% of its pre-pandemic capacity in July-September as a travel recovery takes hold in mainland 
Europe, and Britain is expected to catch-up in the coming weeks.
The British airline said it was confident on demand for the summer and autumn, issuing its most buoyant update 
since the start of the pandemic almost a year and a half ago, and allowing it to lift capacity from just 17% of 2019 
levels in March-June.
The travel pick-up has to date been led by the European Union, said easyJet, leading it to shift planes from Britain 
to markets including Scandinavia and Holland.
Two-thirds of bookings are currently coming from the rest of Europe, while normally its business is evenly split 
between Britain and the continent, but easyJet expects that to change now travel rules for fully-vaccinated Britons 
have been relaxed.
"I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the UK demand will follow the same pattern that we're seeing outside 
the UK in mainland Europe," chief executive Johan Lundgren told reporters on Tuesday.
Lundgren has been one of the most vocal critics of Britain's approach to travel over the last two months, slamming 
last-minute changes which have resulted in booking surges and mass cancellations.
Britain should add more countries to its "green list" of low-risk destinations, Lundgren said.
Asked about worries quarantine could be reintroduced for Britons returning from Spain, as it was for France 
recently, he said easyJet was flexible.
"We set ourselves up to be able to cope with shifting demands," he said.
Shares in easyJet traded up 2% to 785 pence at 0845 GMT. The stock has lost about 20% of its value over the last 
month over worries about the impact of strict UK travel rules.
The airline's plan for more flights in July-September, when it tends to make almost all of its profit, is being mirrored 
at rivals such as Ryanair and Wizz Air.
European travel demand drives EasyJet summer comeback
EasyJet, which has shed staff, cut the size of its fleet and taken on new debt to survive, said it was well-placed 
financially, with 2.9 billion pounds ($4 billion) of liquidity, and had cut costs to improve its cash burn rate. ($1 = 
0.7324 pounds)
But it said limited visibility and ongoing uncertainty meant it could not provide guidance for the rest of the year. For 
the three months to June 30, easyJet posted a pretax loss of 318 million pounds.

EC reaffirms (EURO)1.2bn TAP state aid, reviews restructuring aid

TAP Air Portugal (TP, Lisbon) will not have to repay EUR1.2 billion euros (USD1.4 billion) in emergency state 
rescue aid granted last year by the European Commission (EC), securing the airline's immediate status while efforts 
continue to restructure the flag carrier for long-term stability.
This follows a decision by the EC on July 16, 2021, to re-approve the rescue loan to TAP. This comes in spite of the 
European General Court (EGC) - in a case brought by Irish budget carrier Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) - on May 19, 
2021, having overturned the EC's initial decision on June 10, 2020, to award the loan. "We have adopted a new 
decision re-approving the emergency aid in favour of the Portuguese airline TAP. In this way, the rescue aid already 
paid to TAP will not have to be repaid, while efforts continue to develop a solid restructuring plan that will guarantee 
TAP's long-term viability without the need for continued state support," explained EC Executive Vice President 
Margrethe Vestager. As previously reported, Ryanair had argued the aid had been anti-competitive, rewarded 
inefficiency, and had reversed the clock on air transport liberalisation in Europe.
In its ruling, the EGC said the Commission had not indicated, in its decision, whether TAP's holding company, TAP 
SGPS, belonged to a larger group of companies and the possible implications for its financial difficulties. "The 
General Court gave the Commission the possibility to adopt a new decision within two months in order to correct 
these deficiencies. The decision adopted today re-approves the emergency aid and specifies in more detail the 
reasons for the approval of the aid, in the context of the situation of the TAP Group and its shareholders in June 
2020," the EC stated.
Meanwhile, the Commission said it was re-assessing if Portugal may grant the airline another EUR3.2 billion 
(USD3.7 billion) in new restructuring aid as notified on June 10, 2021, she said. This followed a separate decision 
on July 16, following which the EC was reviewing if the new restructuring aid was in line with European Union rules 
on state aid granted to firms in difficulty. Portugal and interested third parties would have the opportunity to present 
their case. "We will maintain a constructive dialogue with the Portuguese authorities on this issue," Vestager said in 
a statement.
The Portuguese state support is expected to take the form of equity and quasi-equity measures worth about 
EUR2.7 billion (USD3.2 billion), which would include the EUR1.2 billion rescue loan to be converted into equity. 
Portugal would grant, from 2022, additional support of around EUR512 million (USD602 million), in the form of a 
state guarantee to secure commercial loans, in case TAP could not access financial markets in 2023-2025, as 
currently forecast.
EC reaffirms (EURO)1.2bn TAP state aid, reviews restructuring aid
The overhaul plan involves around 2,000 job cuts by 2022, pay cuts of up to 25%, a reduced fleet and route 
network, and the sale of non-core assets.
In its review, the EC said it would in particular look at the following:
Whether TAP could proportionately contribute to the restructuring costs to reduce the burden on the Fiscus;
Whether the restructuring plan was accompanied by appropriate measures to prevent an anti-competitive situation.
EU state aid rules allow member states to support firms in difficulty, under certain strict conditions. Rescue aid may 
be granted for a maximum of six months, whereafter it must be repaid or member states must submit a restructuring 
plan to the EC, which it assesses under the state aid rules. For the restructuring aid to be approved, the plan must 
ensure that the company's viability can be restored without continued state support, that the company sufficiently 
contributes to its restructuring costs, and that the distortions of competition created by the aid are corrected through 
compensatory measures.

 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet Monday with Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 
in a show of support for the self-exiled candidate who says she won last year's elections. 
Blinken will join a meeting between Tikhanovskaya and State Department number three Victoria Nuland, known as 
a forceful critic of Moscow, a day before the Belarusian opposition chief holds meetings at the White House, 
according to the top US diplomat's public schedule. 
President Joe Biden has vowed to ramp up pressure on President Alexander Lukashenko, an ally of Moscow who 
has been in power for nearly three decades and whose security forces have put down mass protests following the 
announcement that he secured a sixth term. 
 Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya looks on before she delivers a speech in Prague during a 
protest in June 2021 Photo: AFP / Michal Cizek  
Tikhanovskaya, until then a stay-at-home mother, ran in place of her husband who was detained before the election 
and claimed to have easily won. 
"The world has been inspired by the Belarusian people -- including the Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya -- who continue to bravely demand a meaningful voice in their country's future in the face of cruel 
repression," a US official said last week when announcing her visit. 
The United States, European Union, Britain and Canada last month jointly imposed new sanctions on Belarus after 
a Ryanair passenger flight was grounded in Minsk on the pretext of a security threat, with authorities arresting an 
opposition activist and his girlfriend who were on board.

 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet Monday with Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 
in a show of support for the self-exiled candidate who says she won last year's elections. 
 Blinken will join a meeting between Tikhanovskaya and State Department number three Victoria Nuland, known as 
a forceful critic of Moscow, a day before the Belarusian opposition chief holds meetings at the White House, 
according to the top US diplomat's public schedule. 
 President Joe Biden has vowed to ramp up pressure on President Alexander Lukashenko, an ally of Moscow who 
has been in power for nearly three decades and whose security forces have put down mass protests following the 
announcement that he secured a sixth term. 
 Tikhanovskaya, until then a stay-at-home mother, ran in place of her husband who was detained before the 
election and claimed to have easily won. 
 'The world has been inspired by the Belarusian people — including the Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya — who continue to bravely demand a meaningful voice in their country's future in the face of cruel 
repression,' a US official said last week when announcing her visit. 
 The United States, European Union, Britain and Canada last month jointly imposed new sanctions on Belarus after 
a Ryanair passenger flight was grounded in Minsk on the pretext of a security threat, with authorities arresting an 
opposition activist and his girlfriend who were on board.

The case for taxing European flights Making holidays more expensive will inevitably be politically difficult
The case for taxing European flights; Making holidays more expensive will 
inevitably be politically difficult

If you fancied flying from London to Tuscany this weekend, a one-way ticket to Pisa cost just £4.99 on Ryanair, 
before any "optional" extras, and a still reasonable £70.99 on easyJet. This might not last. Of all the measures set 
out in this week's sweeping EU climate action blueprint, the ones ordinary Europeans may notice first are those 
aimed at the bloc's airlines.
Aviation has only accounted for about 4 per cent of EU carbon emissions in recent years and obviously fell during 
the pandemic, but past trends suggest curbs will be needed to make sure flying does not endanger the bloc's goal 
of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050. Brussels aims to tax conventional kerosene jet fuel for intra-European 
flights and require greener fuel to be gradually blended in with kerosene.
Airlines would also have to eventually pay for their planes' pollution, as free allowances under the EU's emissions 
trading system are phased out.
The aviation industry's response to these plans has been strident. Trade bodies say the measures would eventually 
raise ticket prices and could be counterproductive if aircraft fly longer routes to skirt new levies. The International Air 
Transport Association says taxes "siphon money from the industry" that could support investments in greener 
aircraft and technologies.
The association has a point. Governments should have done more earlier to promote sustainable aviation fuels, the 
main solution to the industry's emissions in the absence of planes powered by electricity or other green alternatives. 
Likewise, more could have been done to help cleaner train journeys compete against dirtier short-haul flights. Yet 
The case for taxing European flights Making holidays more expensive will inevitably be politically difficult
the airlines' arguments would have more force if the industry had shown a greater willingness to effectively tackle its 
emissions in the past. Instead, some of its members repeatedly resisted earlier EU efforts to rein in pollution. Since 
then, public demands for action have grown, along with a new campaign of "flight shaming" frequent flyers.
Even so, policymakers must ensure that the burden of climate measures does not fall too heavily on those least 
able to carry it and, perhaps, most in need of a holiday. The EU's climate plans include a (EURO)72bn "social 
climate fund" to ease the impact on poorer countries. Others have come up with innovative ideas to specifically spur 
fair green aviation policies.
Existing air passenger duties would be scrapped and replaced by a frequent flyer levy on the 15 per cent of people 
who take 70 per cent of flights under one proposal this month from a UK think-tank. The plan would raise £5bn a 
year, says the New Economics Foundation, while limiting emissions and offering poorer people a better chance of 
travelling after the pandemic.
There will be much haggling to come over the final shape of the policies in the European Commission's "Fit for 55" 
climate blueprint, which is named for the bloc's aim to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent from 1990 
levels by 2030.
This is a profoundly ambitious target. It took nearly 30 years for the emissions of the EU's 27 current members to 
fall 24 per cent from what they were in 1990. Brussels now aims to more than double the size of that reduction in 
just nine years.
The scale of the climate crisis demands such action. This week's deadly floods in western Europe, and the searing 
heatwaves in North America before that, underline the need for policies that should have been enacted decades 
ago. All industries must play their part in the far-reaching changes needed to bring emissions down to safer levels. 
That includes airlines too.

If you fancied flying from London to Tuscany this weekend, a one-way ticket to Pisa cost just £4.99 on Ryanair, 
before any "optional" extras, and a still reasonable £70.99 on easyJet. This might not last. Of all the measures set 
out in this week's sweeping EU climate action blueprint, the ones ordinary Europeans may notice first are those 
aimed at the bloc's airlines.
Aviation has only accounted for about 4 per cent of EU carbon emissions in recent years and obviously fell during 
the pandemic, but past trends suggest curbs will be needed to make sure flying does not endanger the bloc's goal 
of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050. Brussels aims to tax conventional kerosene jet fuel for intra-European 
flights and require greener fuel to be gradually blended in with kerosene.
Airlines would also have to eventually pay for their planes' pollution, as free allowances under the EU's emissions 
trading system are phased out.
The aviation industry's response to these plans has been strident. Trade bodies say the measures would eventually 
raise ticket prices and could be counterproductive if aircraft fly longer routes to skirt new levies. The International Air 
Transport Association says taxes "siphon money from the industry" that could support investments in greener 
aircraft and technologies.
The association has a point. Governments should have done more earlier to promote sustainable aviation fuels, the 
main solution to the industry's emissions in the absence of planes powered by electricity or other green alternatives. 
Likewise, more could have been done to help cleaner train journeys compete against dirtier short-haul flights. Yet 
The case for taxing European flights; Making holidays more expensive will inevitably be politically difficult
the airlines' arguments would have more force if the industry had shown a greater willingness to effectively tackle its 
emissions in the past. Instead, some of its members repeatedly resisted earlier EU efforts to rein in pollution. Since 
then, public demands for action have grown, along with a new campaign of "flight shaming" frequent flyers.
Even so, policymakers must ensure that the burden of climate measures does not fall too heavily on those least 
able to carry it and, perhaps, most in need of a holiday. The EU's climate plans include a (EURO)72bn "social 
climate fund" to ease the impact on poorer countries. Others have come up with innovative ideas to specifically spur 
fair green aviation policies.
Existing air passenger duties would be scrapped and replaced by a frequent flyer levy on the 15 per cent of people 
who take 70 per cent of flights under one proposal this month from a UK think-tank. The plan would raise £5bn a 
year, says the New Economics Foundation, while limiting emissions and offering poorer people a better chance of 
travelling after the pandemic.
There will be much haggling to come over the final shape of the policies in the European Commission's "Fit for 55" 
climate blueprint, which is named for the bloc's aim to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent from 1990 
levels by 2030.
This is a profoundly ambitious target. It took nearly 30 years for the emissions of the EU's 27 current members to 
fall 24 per cent from what they were in 1990. Brussels now aims to more than double the size of that reduction in 
just nine years.
The scale of the climate crisis demands such action. This week's deadly floods in western Europe, and the searing 
heatwaves in North America before that, underline the need for policies that should have been enacted decades 
ago. All industries must play their part in the far-reaching changes needed to bring emissions down to safer levels. 
That includes airlines too.

Refugees Not So Welcome in Lithuania

Jul 17, 2021( Gates of Vienna: http://gatesofvienna.net/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 One of the preferred routes for migrants from the Middle East and South Asia to the European Union used to be 
the 'Balkan Route', which involved a short sea passage from Anatolia to the Greek islands, and then an overland 
trek (via buses chartered by NGOs) through the Balkans to the Austrian border. In the last couple of months that 
route has been superseded by one that involves airliner flights from the Middle East to Belarus, then overland 
passage to the border with Lithuania, and thus to the EU. 
 Now Lithuania is cracking down on the flow of immigrants, and is even — horrors! — building a fence. Hellequin 
GB, who translated the article below, includes this introductory note: 
Now who would've thought that just a few days ago, after Lithuania announced the construction of a barbed wire 
fence with Belarus to block the illegal entry of migrants, mainly from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, that they would go 
one step further and tighten their asylum policy. I'm flabbergasted. 
The translated article from Kronen Zeitung[1]: 
Mass arrests of refugees in Lithuania 
 In the conflict with neighboring Belarus, Lithuania's parliament has approved mass arrests of refugees. The new 
law stipulates that they can only be released six months after their arrival at the earliest. The rights of objection are 
also restricted for rejected asylum seekers. 
 The law is intended to deter migrants from coming via Belarus to Lithuania and thus to the EU, as Interior Minister 
Agne Bilotaite told parliament. 
 'Such migrants are not real asylum seekers' 
 Such migrants are not real asylum seekers, but a means for Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to 
destabilize the Baltic country. 84 MPs voted for the regulation. There was one vote against and five abstentions. 
The Lithuanian Red Cross and human rights organizations criticized the law. It violates Lithuania's international 
obligations and the rights of refugees. 
 1,100 people came to Lithuania from Belarus in July. The Lithuanian government had repeatedly asserted that 
refugees were being brought by air from Baghdad and Istanbul to Belarus in Minsk and from there to the Lithuanian 
Refugees Not So Welcome in Lithuania
border. According to the Lithuanian border guard, more than 1,700 people came from Belarus to Lithuania this year, 
1,100 of them in July alone. On Friday, Lithuania began building a 550-kilometer border fence with Belarus. 
 Lukashenko had announced that his country would no longer prevent migrants from crossing the border to 
Lithuania and thus to the EU. He was reacting to EU sanctions after Belarus forced a Ryanair flight to land in Minsk 
and then arrested the Belarusian opposition leader Roman Protassevich, who was on board. 
Afterword from the translator: 
Isn't it funny — when Obama forced the Bolivian president's plane to land in Vienna in 2015, because he thought 
Edward Snowden was aboard, there were no EU sanctions against the US. The moral double standards of those 
prostitutes in the EU, when it comes to bend over backwards for some political sodomy, makes even the Devil 
blush.

Court rules against Ryanair in Austrian Airlines aid case
Court rules against Ryanair in Austrian Airlines aid case

The Luxembourg-based European General Court has dismissed a complaint Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) brought 
against the European Commission's approval of state aid last year for Lufthansa Group subsidiary Austrian Airlines 
(OS, Vienna).
Ryanair and its own Austrian subsidiary at the time, Lauda (now Lauda Europe), sued against the Austrian 
government's assistance of EUR150 million euros (USD178 million) to the flag carrier. The aid was meant as 
compensation for the damage caused to Austrian Airlines' finances during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The sum was part of a total financing package worth EUR600 million (USD709 million) that also included an equity 
grant of EUR150 million from Lufthansa and a state-guaranteed bank loan of EUR300 million (USD354 million).
"The General Court confirms that the aid granted by Austria to Austrian Airlines in order to compensate it for the 
damage resulting from the cancellation or rescheduling of its flights due to the Covid-19 pandemic is compatible 
with the internal market," the court said in its July 14 ruling.
The court agreed with the commission that "aid to make good damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional 
occurrences is compatible with the internal market" of the European Union.
"That aid, having been deducted from the subsidies granted, in the same context, by Germany to Lufthansa Group, 
which includes Austrian Airlines, does not constitute overcompensation in favour of that group," the court 
elaborated.
Austrian commented in its own statement: "The ruling by the European General Court allows Austrian Airlines to 
continue flying high. The aid of EUR150 million approved in July 2020 was and is still necessary to safeguard 
Austria's largest aviation company with more than 6,000 employees and to maintain Austria's international 
connections via the Vienna hub in the long term."
Ryanair has launched 16 lawsuits against the European Commission for approving billions of euros to be 
channelled from the national budgets of member states to individual airlines hit by coronavirus-related travel 
restrictions. So far, the European General Court has ruled in favour of Ryanair against aid handed to Condor, KLM 
Royal Dutch Airlines, and TAP Air Portugal but has thrown out its challenges against aid for Air France, Finnair, and 
SAS Scandinavian Airlines.
Court rules against Ryanair in Austrian Airlines aid case
The budget carrier has said it will appeal the latest ruling to Europe's highest court, the European Court of Justice.

Wizz chief 's bumper pay plan is a sign of the times
Wizz chief 's bumper pay plan is a sign of the times

I s the UK's latest pay bust-up ready for take-off? Proxy adviser ISS this week joined Glass Lewis in recommending 
that shareholders reject a plan for Wizz Air's József Váradi that could hand the founder and chief executive up to 
£100m over eight years.
They called the potential windfall "excessive", raising concerns about the plan's structure and the focus on share 
price performance.
To earn top whack, Váradi will need to more than double the airline's share price over five years, a compound 
annual growth rate of 20 per cent.
To get anything at all, the shares must pass a 10 per cent growth rate, at which point the payouts start at £20m.
This has the makings of a classic pay stink: uncomfortably big numbers for a boss who is already a 6 per cent 
shareholder, against the backdrop of a doubling in pay revolts at big UK-listed companies this year.
The notable absence, so far, of vocal investor dissent may be down to a couple of factors.
First, the Hungary-based, Jerseyregistered company has a rather international shareholder register, including a 
sizeable US following where private equity backer Indigo Partner is based.
Wizz chief 's bumper pay plan is a sign of the times
Second, the UK institutions that tend to police pay most assiduously don't hold the sway they once did. The rise of 
tracker funds isn't the issue so much as Brexit: Wizz Air, like rival Ryanair, has partially "disenfranchised" UK and 
US investors to meet EU ownership rules for airlines, including for the vote later this month.
The £100m on offer may jar against a low-cost ethos and comparatively low-paid crew. But Váradi's performance 
isn't in doubt: the shares have more than tripled since its 2015 listing. And the airline has a better claim than most to 
be creating a high-risk, high-reward package to retain an entrepreneurial boss who is in demand, not least from the 
improbably high numbers who think a pandemic is a great time to start an airline.
The plan is also longer-term than your bog-standard package. The targets are stretching, requiring adding about 
£7bn in market value at the top end. Unlike Cineworld's bonus scheme, the shares don't start from a bombed-out 
level but close to an all-time high. There are new reward plans for all employees.
The broader context is the growing angst about the dearth of founder-led, high-growth businesses on the London 
market as well as concerns that the appeal of private equity ownership for executives (more money, fewer annoying 
questions) is leaching talent from the public markets. The boss of SSP, owner of travel-orientated baguette chain 
Upper Crust, this week turned in his apron after only two years for a job in private equity; the shares sank.
Perhaps to soften the impression of unpalatably ruthless capitalist tendencies, Váradi's package contains ESG 
metrics, worth 10 per cent of the payout, an increasingly popular option that generally deserves more scrutiny. The 
emissions target falls squarely into the category of stuff they were going to do anyway.
On an emissions per revenue passenger kilometre basis, it goes hand in hand with ambitious growth plans that 
involve flying and emitting more, albeit using a newer, more efficient fleet than the competitors that it hopes to 
squeeze.
Given that Wizz's emissions per RPK jumped last year as the pandemic emptied planes, pretty much the entirety of 
the promised 36 per cent reduction over the five years to March 2026 can be accounted for by a post-pandemic 
recovery in flying and larger aircraft already on order. If cramming more people on to lower-cost aircraft sounds part 
and parcel of the Wizz strategy, that's because it www.is.No wonder the ESG portion of Váradi's plan only pays out 
if the share price targets are hit.
Does his proposed payout look toppy, given the chances he would abandon a company he calls his "baby"? Yes. 
Would cutting the windfall 20 or 30 per cent have won over proxy firms? Unlikely. Would shareholders contest that 
he's worth retaining or begrudge him his millions if he actually hits the big target? Probably not.
Just don't kid yourself that he's saving the planet in the meantime.

 Security officials in Belarus have raided the homes of several independent journalists as part of an ongoing 
crackdown.Belarusian police on Friday carried out a third successive day of raids across the country against 
journalists and human rights activists. 
The raids follow searches by the country's notorious KGB earlier this week of offices of a dozen human rights, news 
and opposition groups. 
The swoops appear to be the latest in what opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko called a new 
crackdown. 
Who are the latest targets? 
The broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Friday said security services had searched the home of the 
head of its Minsk bureau, Valentina Zhdanko. 
Other journalists who work for the outlet also reported raids, with at least one of them arrested and taken for 
questioning. 
Meanwhile, three journalists working for the opposition channel Belsat said their homes had been searched, as did 
an independent journalist based in the western city of Grodno. 
UN rights chief slams Minsk 
Security officials carried out raids on some 20 human rights, charitable, media and expert institutions. They 
detained more than 15 people, among them the head of prominent rights group Viasna-96. 
UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Thursday said she was "deeply alarmed" by the escalating repression. 
 "Such a crackdown is completely unacceptable," said Bachelet, accusing Minsk of showing "blatant disregard... for 
their obligations under international human rights law." 
Lukashenko earlier this week vowed to "find and bring to justice" all of his country's "wretched NGOs." 
The authoritarian leader — who has ruled the former Soviet republic since 1994 — sparked mass protests by 
claiming to have won a sixth presidential term in an election last year. 
That drew condemnation from the West, whose leaders say the vote was not free or fair.  
Relations between the EU and Belarus have since deteriorated further with Brussels imposing sanctions on Belarus 
after it forced a Ryanair passenger plane to land in Minsk in late May

Jul 16, 2021( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: https://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 A final thought for the week on bank transformation. I often talk to banks. Some I've spoken to for decades. It 
shocks me that, after decades, they still have exactly the same issues. Fragmentation of data; an organisation built 
over decades with systems that are not integrated; data that is split into lines of business and has never been 
rationalised; management who have no idea and cannot make a decision; leadership that have no idea and cannot 
make a decision (because it's too risky); and a broken business that lumbers onwards. 
 Thing is that the business keeps lumbering onwards. 
 If it's a broken business with systems that don't work, how come it keeps lumbering onwards? 
 Lackadaisical customers. 
 Customers don't care. Customers don't see banks as business they love or embrace. Like getting a telephone or 
electricity or water, it's just a utility. It's just a service that has no customer interest and the customer is not 
interested as long as the service works. 
 Dumb pipes or smart pipes, it's just a utility like waterworks. 
 Hmmmm. 
 I kind of agree with this view and disagree. I kind of feel like banks should be compared to airlines. When the airline 
industry worked, you had a number of national carriers. Like the big national banks, the national airline carriers 
were cumbersome, fragmented and a bit broken, but they lumbered onwards. 
 Then you suddenly had challenger airlines like Southwest Airlines in the USA and Ryanair in Europe. These 
airlines changed the game: they cut back the service to nothing and just focused upon getting you from A to B as 
cheaply as possible. 
 Cool. 
 Funnily enough, we haven't seen a bank like that in most countries (maybe this is an opportunity). 
 Then you saw the rise of super-elite airlines who offered far better service at low-cost. Emirates, Etihad, Qatar and 
others. As a friend of mine said, when you fly from America to Asia, the US airlines is like getting into a grubby old 
yellow taxi and then you switch to the West Asian airlines and it's like entering a Rolls-Royce. Great simile. 
 I see the same simile in the telecommunications industry. AT&#38;T and BT and others have been around for 
years. They provided dial-up services. Who even know what a dial-up is anymore? Sure, those companies are still 
Galileo or Mars - where do you want to go?
going, but we all moved to being mobile. Vodafone, O2, Verizon and more are now mainstream. Who even thinks 
about AT&#38;T and BT? 
 Now, sure these firms are still around and, luckily for them, managed to become the backbone of broadband 
services. Great. Yet, it's still a challenge to move from dial-up to broadband to mobile, so that transition was not 
obvious or easy. 
 It's a bit like USPS and Royal Mail. People mail each other. It used to be mailing envelopes and letters. People 
actually used to use a pen and paper and write to each other!?!?! Who the hell does that anymore? 
 Then, luckily for USPS and Royal Mail, everyone switched to ordered stuff online so that's what's now sent and 
delivered. Forget pen and paper, we want Amazon boxes. Thing is that it's also created DPD, UPS, FedEx and 
more. 
 In other words, the world has changed, but many of the businesses that were around last century are still here 
today because they've changed too. Have they changed enough? Can they keep up? Are they fit for purpose today 
and tomorrow? 
 Who knows, but what I do know is that American Airlines, British Airways, AT&#38;T, BT, USPS, Royal Mail and 
more are trying to become 21st century digital businesses but are struggling with it in the same way as Chase and 
Lloyds. Yet, when you lift the hood on any of these businesses, there's an aching, creaking old infrastructure 
underneath. If you haven't seen it, just look at Galileo which is the old system that runs the airlines. 
 Galileo is a green-screen 3270 mainframe system developed about a thousand years ago. Just go up to any airline 
desk and ask the check-in person to show you their screen. It's absolutely archaically disgusting. 
 Nevertheless, by comparison with what some of my bank friends deal with, it's truly visionary and innovatory. 
Damn. 
 Refresh and reboot or solve and evolve? What do you think? Galileo or Mars? Where do you want to go?

Ryanair confirms Dublin-Kerry launch in early 3Q21

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) confirmed on July 14 that it would fly between Dublin Int'l and Kerry, taking up an Irish 
domestic service previously run by defunct Aer Lingus Regional operator Stobart Air (RE, Dublin Int'l). On the same 
day, the Ryanair website began to show seats for sale on the route, starting from July 28.
Stobart's collapse last month prompted the government to seek bids from airlines to operate services on a public 
service obligation (PSO) basis between Dublin and both Kerry and Donegal.
However, last week Ryanair jumped in to say it would operate the Kerry route on a commercial basis, saving 
taxpayers' money, initially 1x daily and rising to 2x daily from September 1.
That prompted the government to announce that Ryanair would take over the route on a commercial basis from 
July 19, but Ryanair issued a counter-release alleging that no agreement had yet been concluded. The carrier 
claimed the statement from Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan had been issued without it being consulted, calling it 
"premature and inaccurate."
On the morning on July 14, though, the airline confirmed it would provide a commercial, unsubsidised schedule for 
Dublin-Kerry starting on July 28, using one of its B737-800s. That would ultimately quadruple the number of 
available seats on the service to 5,000 a week, it added.
Nevertheless, Ryanair DAC CEO Eddie Wilson cautioned that costs must be lowered at Dublin and Kerry airports to 
make it commercially viable.
Ryanair already operates international flights from Kerry to London Luton (3x weekly), London Stansted, 
Manchester Int'l, and Alicante (2x weekly each), the ch-aviation schedules module shows.
Also on July 14, Wilson again criticised the Irish government and "Minister Ryan's failure to take any action to 
promote air travel recovery [which] has led to Ireland being the most damaged aviation market in Europe as 
evidenced by this week's Eurocontrol statistics. Other island nations like Malta and Cyprus have vastly 
outperformed Ireland."

Newquay Airport needs to face surge in growth after 2021
Newquay Airport needs to face surge in growth after 2021

Highlight: With growing domestic tourism demand in 2021, coupled with a record number of airlines operating 
flights to Newquay, the Cornwall-based airport will need to consider expanding in the next few years if the 
destination can sustain demand.
Body
Ten airlines are now operating domestic routes to Newquay Airport, including some of Europe's top carriers such as 
EasyJet, Ryanair and British Airways. The record number of airlines now flying to the airport directly connects 
Newquay to all corners of the UK and Northern Ireland, enabling it to recapture its initial growth between 2015 and 
2019. Increased domestic air traffic will drive future growthNewquay Airport is no stranger to rapid growth. 
According to the airport's website, before the pandemic, it witnessed an 83% growth in arrivals between 2015 and 
2019, reaching approximately 461,000 at the end of this time scale. 
Naturally, the trend bucked due to the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020 and 2021, with many flights grounded due to 
travel restrictions. However, the figures show that the popularity of the area was growing considerably prior to the 
pandemic. In addition, the pandemic has accelerated the trend for summer staycations in 2021 and 2022, due to 
the continuation of quarantine measures and international travel restrictions across Europe. The increase in airlines 
operating to the airport is also an excellent opportunity for Cornwall to win new markets and tourists. Airline 
newcomers to the airport are Ryanair and British Airways and they will open a realm of potential new leisure and 
business travellers, driving future growth. This increase also means most of the Flybe slots lost due to the airline's 
bankruptcy are replaced, covering the shortfall. Moreover, the government plans to scrap domestic air passenger 
duty could increase demand to Cornwall quickly by lowering the cost of flights. This legislation will undoubtedly be 
welcomed by budget carrier giants, EasyJet and Ryanair, which are likely to pass on these savings to the 
consumer. This law may be a short-term measure, but it is an additional opportunity for the airport to build on the 
shortfall of international travel. Ultimately, the exposure to more major airlines means there is potential to create a 
more diverse network as the pandemic eases, providing demand is sustainable. Projections show demand will 
increase for Cornwall in the futureThe challenge is whether Cornwall as a destination can sustain demand after 
2022, but the signs are looking positive. In May 2021, Airbnb reported that rentals in Cornwall surpassed London as 
the most popular summer location. Likewise, according to GlobalData's tourism demands and flows database, 
Newquay Airport needs to face surge in growth after 2021
domestic visits to the south-west of England will increase by a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 7% from 
2021 to 2025. Furthermore, in 2022, most international restrictions will likely be lifted depending on Europe's 
vaccination progress, meaning an increase in international tourism is imminent. Therefore, Newquay Airport must 
consider expansion over the next few years to cope with rapidly growing domestic and international traffic.

       European stocks declined on Wednesday as investors fretted about the impact higher prices will have on 
economies around the world.
 Official data showed earlier today that U.K. consumer inflation rose to 2.5 percent in June from 2.1 percent in May. 
The rate was forecast to climb to 2.2 percent.
 The annual growth was largely driven by prices of food, second-hand cars and clothing and footwear.
 On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.5 percent, following a 0.6 percent rise in May. The expected rate 
was 0.2 percent.
 Weak Eurozone industrial production data also dented sentiment. Industrial output fell 1 percent on a monthly basis 
in May, reversing a revised 0.6 percent rise in April, Eurostat said. The pace of decline exceeded the economists' 
forecast of -0.2 percent.
 Meanwhile, after U.S. inflation data blew past Wall Street's expectations, investors now wait for guidance from Fed 
Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on monetary policy and the economy today and 
tomorrow.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 dropped 0.3 percent to 459.56 after ending flat with a positive bias on Tuesday.
 The German DAX and France's CAC 40 index both slipped around 0.2 percent, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was 
down half a percent.
 Swedish telecoms operator Tele2 jumped 5.4 percent after it reported an 8 percent rise in quarterly core earnings.
 Italian fashion company Brunello Cucinelli edged down slightly despite raising 2021 sales forecast for the second 
time this year.
 Travel & leisure stocks were losing ground, with TUI tumbling 4 percent on reports the world's largest holiday 
company has cancelled more holidays until August.
 easyJet dropped 1.6 percent, Ryanair Holdings shed 0.6 percent and British Airways owner IAG lost 1.2 percent on 
worries over the Delta variant's spread in the continent.
 German airline Lufthansa fell nearly 1 percent after saying passenger numbers are currently around 40 percent of 
pre-pandemic levels.
 Fashion house Hugo Boss rallied 3.5 percent. The company remains confident that its overall business recovery 
will continue in the second half of 2021, despite the persisting uncertainties regarding the further development of 
the pandemic.

Putting rights before profits; Activists are increasing pressure on asset

L ate one evening last November Nickolai Prakofyeu answered the phone to some troubling news: he had 24 hours 
to leave Belarus or face at least 12 years in prison. Prakofyeu's father had been tipped off by a sympathetic source 
within the Belarusian KGB that the security forces of Alexander Lukashenko's regime were no longer willing to 
tolerate the family's prodemocracy activities since last August's disputed election.
Officials were about to shut down his family's hotels and restaurant in the south-eastern city of Gomel, which had 
been giving free food to anti-government protesters. After the warning, Prakofyeu and his wife had time to gather 
just a few belongings before fleeing.
"We packed what we could and drove to Ukraine," says the 28-year-old, who has since linked up with the Belarus 
opposition in exile in Poland. He now spends his time pressuring western companies into ditching their investments 
in his home country. They include an array of asset managers who have funded Lukashenko's authoritarian regime 
by buying Belarusian government debt.
Such divestment campaigns are not new in the world of emerging markets investing, where European and North 
American fund groups frequently use their clients' money to bankroll unsavoury regimes. But they have been given

fresh impetus by the phenomenon of ESG investing - which evaluates investments on environmental, social and 
governance criteria. And by the public attention Belarus has attracted.
Prakofyeu has tried to hold the industry to its promises, writing to asset managers such as BlackRock and UBS to 
ask if owning Belarus' bonds is consistent with their policies, "given that the proceeds support the terroristic regime 
which is involved in gross human rights violations". UBS says it only holds small positions of these bonds.
"All of these companies say 'we're all about ESG and sustainable practices'," Prakofyeu says. "But when it comes 
to their investments, it seems like no one really cares."
Such campaigns have enjoyed isolated success. Even before Belarus' forced grounding of a Ryanair flight in May 
sparked a tightening of US and EU sanctions, a group of Danish asset managers sold all their Belarus government 
debt. Germany's Union Investment has also sold out, while BlueBay Asset Management avoided last year's bond 
sale over human rights concerns. EU sanctions, imposed in June, prevent European investors from buying or 
trading any new Belarusian bonds, but do not affect existing bond holdings.
Many emerging market investors point to a dilemma for the industry: if they steer clear of Belarusian bonds, what 
about other countries with dubious human rights records? Many worry privately it would be hard to make money if 
the likes of Russia, Saudi Arabia or China were off-limits.
"All of the countries in the emerging markets index will have some issue of some kind - there's no perfect way to do 
it," says Richard House, chief investment officer for emerging market debt at Allianz Global Investors. "It's a bit of a 
pandora's box."
Missing out on profitable trades The dilemma over human rights exposes an uncomfortable tension at the heart of 
the ESG boom. Is all the effort spent measuring and evaluating "ESG factors" simply a way to improve returns by 
avoiding some hitherto under-appreciated risks? Or is investing more "sustainably" an end in itself?
Asset managers love to pretend both these goals are in perfect harmony. Logically, that won't always be the case. 
And up to now a poor human rights record has been little barrier to borrowing money from western investors.
Saudi Arabia has successfully sold $32bn of international bonds since the start of 2019, according to data from 
Bond Radar, despite widespread condemnation of the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi linked to Crown 
Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Riyadh's military campaign in neighbouring Yemen. Over the same period 
Russia, under international pressure over events such as its 2014 annexation of Crimea, has raised more than 
$10bn on international bond markets.
Egypt is a very popular holding among emerging market bond managers, even though president Abdel Fattah al-
Sisi's government holds tens of thousands of government critics in prison on politically-motivated charges, 
according to Human Rights Watch.
Prominent holders of its bonds include BlackRock, AllianceBernstein and Crédit Agricole. ESG and human rights 
are important issues for all three, according to their websites. BlackRock and Crédit Agricole declined to comtries 
ment. AllianceBernstein said no country it does business in "demonstrates policies, strategies and actions that are 
100 per cent ideal or responsible".
Foreign investors have also grown active in China's massive bond market, despite the imposition of a security law 
in Hong Kong and its treatment of the Muslim Uyghur population in Xinjiang province, which the US state 
department has described as "genocide".
Criticised by human rights activists, many fund managers insist that deciding what to do about bonds issued by 
unsavoury regimes is not straightforward. Their mandate is to make money. In a performance-based industry, 
excluding countries over human rights concerns could deny them access to profitable trades.
Putting rights before profits Activists are increasing pressure on asset managers to stop backing regimes that 
abuse their own citizens. But some investors worr....
"We have a core responsibility to generate a return for investors, and a lot of the challenging ESG stories [countries 
ranking poorly on environmental or social measures] have the [highest] yields, which creates a bias to invest," says 
Timothy Ash, senior emerging market sovereign strategist at BlueBay.
And while a country may score badly in one area, it could fare better elsewhere. Ash highlights Saudi Arabia: while 
Prince Mohammed approved a "capture or kill" operation on Khashoggi, according to US intelligence, he has also 
introduced reforms.
Some asset managers believe the scrutiny on them is unfair. "We're not here to measure the extent of human rights 
violations," says the head of emerging market debt at a big global asset manager that holds Belarusian government 
bonds. "We're not going to go to Saudi Arabia and ask them to become a democracy."
Nor would their investors wish them to, he argues. The firm manages money for western pensioners, Middle 
Eastern sovereign wealth funds and wealthy Chinese individuals - to automatically assume a preference for 
democracies would be perverse, he says. "Some investors don't want to invest in coun- that have a problem with 
racism.
Does that mean we shouldn't invest in the US?" he asks.
'Turning a blind eye to abuses' Many fund managers say they are simply deferring to widely-used bond benchmarks 
against which their performance is judged when explaining why they invest in countries with poor human rights 
records.
Belarus remains part of the benchmark JPMorgan emerging market bond index, a broad index of countries 
accessible to investors. Such indices aim to provide a snapshot of investable assets, rather than make moral 
judgments about inclusion. JPMorgan said in April it was considering ejecting Russian bonds because US sanctions 
might render it impractical or illegal to purchase them. Most fund managers take a similar view, preferring to wait 
until sanctions are threatened or in place before selling.
ESG bond indices, which are often based on ratings from specialist firms and which are designed to provide clarity 
on ethical investing, can add to the confusion.
The widely used JPMorgan ESG EMBI Global Diversified index uses ESG scoring and screening "to tilt toward 
issuers ranked higher on ESG criteria and green bond issues, and to underweight and remove issuers that rank 
lower". Its biggest exposure is to the United Arab Emirates at 5.2 per cent. Yet, hundreds of activists, academics 
and lawyers are in prison in the UAE, "in many cases following unfair trials on vague and broad charges", according 
to HRW. Saudi Arabia is the index's third-biggest weighting, while China is also included.
More than 37 per cent of the bonds in the JPMorgan EMBI index are issued by countries labelled "not free" by 
human rights campaign group Freedom House. Even in the ESG version of the index, that figure is 34 per cent.
Some managers have begun to take action themselves. AkademikerPension, a Danish pension fund for academics, 
sold out of Belarus bonds in April on human rights grounds, and now excludes 45 countries, including China, Saudi 
Arabia and Venezuela.
The fund has taken a harder line because its members have made it clear human rights are a priority when 
choosing investments, chief executive Jens Munch Holst says. Even so, working out where to draw the line is 
difficult. "It's a dilemma. Whenever we exclude a country, we always get asked 'why not these other countries too?'" 
he says. "At some point too many exclusions might start to hurt our returns - it hasn't yet."
Although such an approach remains rare, there are increasing signs that other investors are taking notice of human 
rights. Germany's Union Investment decided not to buy Tajikistan's bonds because of abuses. The firm also raised 
the Khashoggi killing with Saudi representatives in 2019 and the dominant role of the military with the Egyptian 
government, says Christian Kopf, head of fixed income and currencies.
Putting rights before profits Activists are increasing pressure on asset managers to stop backing regimes that 
abuse their own citizens. But some investors worr....
But often appeals made to fund managers have little impact. "Certain investors are [turning] a blind eye to human 
rights abuses," says Vytis Jurkonis of Freedom House. "They are contributing to the survival of the regimes."
A detained diplomat's case A poor human rights record also appears to be little barrier to countries building a 
presence in bond markets.
Since the death of authoritarian dictator Islam Karimov in 2016, Uzbekistan, which used to rank alongside North 
Korea for its political rights and civil liberties, has tried to open up to the outside world. President Shavkat 
Mirziyoyev has released political prisoners, lifted exchange controls and encouraged debate. This year the central 
Asian country published its first report on its ESG progress, which said it had introduced laws to enhance civil and 
economic rights and was working to eradicate forced labour in its cotton industry.
Yield-hungry investors have flooded in. A debut eurobond in 2019 and a subsequent issue late last year were 
heavily oversubscribed, raising more than $1.5bn. Blue-chip investors such as T Rowe Price, M&G, Candriam and 
Neuberger Berman bought in.
But concerns are growing over the state of human rights in the country. HRW notes that "grave rights violations, 
including impunity for torture and abuse of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) people, persist" while 
journalists have been "arbitrarily prosecuted".
Kadyr Yusupov, 69, a former highranking Uzbek diplomat convicted of treason by a closed court last year, is one of 
those said to have been mistreated.
In April last year Yusupov raised concerns about prisoner welfare. According to a December 2020 submission to a 
UN working party by Yusupov's son Babur, who says his father was wrongly convicted, the former diplomat was 
threatened and put in a punishment cell.
After two days on hunger strike, Yusupov was transferred to a cell measuring 1.5 metres by 2 metres, containing a 
metal chair and a bed, as well as a torn mattress that was taken away during the day. The toilet was a hole in the 
ground, and the cell was, according to the submission, infested with scorpions and snakes. The filing also details 
alleged psychological torture by Uzbek security services, including threats of sexual violence against him, his wife 
and daughter, and to arrest his sons.
In May the UN working group on arbitrary detention found that Yusupov's imprisonment contravened five articles of 
its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and called for his immediate release. Uzbekistan's ministries of justice 
and foreign affairs did not respond to requests for comment.
"It's been remarkable how people have just said 'we don't really care too much about what's going on politically and 
locally, because the credit is so healthy'," says Max Hess, central Asian fellow at the Foreign Policy Research 
Institute. He points to Uzbekistan's good record on investor relations as being attractive to fund managers.
Investors including Neuberger Berman, Candriam and M&G point to signs of ESG progress in Uzbekistan. 
Neuberger says it is monitoring the situation, "including the case of Mr Yusupov, and should we get more evidence 
that Uzbekistan is regressing on the reform momentum, we would look to reduce our exposure".
Since March 2021, EU rules have required fund managers to disclose how they account for the ESG impacts of 
their investments. And from 2023 they will have to provide details on the human rights records of the countries they 
lend to, boosting transparency.
For some, such pressure cannot come soon enough. Babur Yusupov contacted JPMorgan, which underwrote 
Uzbekistan's bonds, in 2019 shortly after his father's arrest and again on June 23 this year. JPMorgan 
acknowledged his approach in July after the Financial Times contacted it to ask about its involvement in 
Uzbekistan. JPMorgan declined to comment.
Putting rights before profits Activists are increasing pressure on asset managers to stop backing regimes that

L ate one evening last November Nickolai Prakofyeu answered the phone to some troubling news: he had 24 hours 
to leave Belarus or face at least 12 years in prison. Prakofyeu's father had been tipped off by a sympathetic source 
within the Belarusian KGB that the security forces of Alexander Lukashenko's regime were no longer willing to 
tolerate the family's prodemocracy activities since last August's disputed election.
Officials were about to shut down his family's hotels and restaurant in the south-eastern city of Gomel, which had 
been giving free food to anti-government protesters. After the warning, Prakofyeu and his wife had time to gather 
just a few belongings before fleeing.
"We packed what we could and drove to Ukraine," says the 28-year-old, who has since linked up with the Belarus 
opposition in exile in Poland. He now spends his time pressuring western companies into ditching their investments 
in his home country. They include an array of asset managers who have funded Lukashenko's authoritarian regime 
by buying Belarusian government debt.
Such divestment campaigns are not new in the world of emerging markets investing, where European and North 
American fund groups frequently use their clients' money to bankroll unsavoury regimes. But they have been given

fresh impetus by the phenomenon of ESG investing - which evaluates investments on environmental, social and 
governance criteria. And by the public attention Belarus has attracted.
Prakofyeu has tried to hold the industry to its promises, writing to asset managers such as BlackRock and UBS to 
ask if owning Belarus' bonds is consistent with their policies, "given that the proceeds support the terroristic regime 
which is involved in gross human rights violations". UBS says it only holds small positions of these bonds.
"All of these companies say 'we're all about ESG and sustainable practices'," Prakofyeu says. "But when it comes 
to their investments, it seems like no one really cares."
Such campaigns have enjoyed isolated success. Even before Belarus' forced grounding of a Ryanair flight in May 
sparked a tightening of US and EU sanctions, a group of Danish asset managers sold all their Belarus government 
debt. Germany's Union Investment has also sold out, while BlueBay Asset Management avoided last year's bond 
sale over human rights concerns. EU sanctions, imposed in June, prevent European investors from buying or 
trading any new Belarusian bonds, but do not affect existing bond holdings.
Many emerging market investors point to a dilemma for the industry: if they steer clear of Belarusian bonds, what 
about other countries with dubious human rights records? Many worry privately it would be hard to make money if 
the likes of Russia, Saudi Arabia or China were off-limits.
"All of the countries in the emerging markets index will have some issue of some kind - there's no perfect way to do 
it," says Richard House, chief investment officer for emerging market debt at Allianz Global Investors. "It's a bit of a 
pandora's box."
Missing out on profitable trades The dilemma over human rights exposes an uncomfortable tension at the heart of 
the ESG boom. Is all the effort spent measuring and evaluating "ESG factors" simply a way to improve returns by 
avoiding some hitherto under-appreciated risks? Or is investing more "sustainably" an end in itself?
Asset managers love to pretend both these goals are in perfect harmony. Logically, that won't always be the case. 
And up to now a poor human rights record has been little barrier to borrowing money from western investors.
Saudi Arabia has successfully sold $32bn of international bonds since the start of 2019, according to data from 
Bond Radar, despite widespread condemnation of the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi linked to Crown 
Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Riyadh's military campaign in neighbouring Yemen. Over the same period 
Russia, under international pressure over events such as its 2014 annexation of Crimea, has raised more than 
$10bn on international bond markets.
Egypt is a very popular holding among emerging market bond managers, even though president Abdel Fattah al-
Sisi's government holds tens of thousands of government critics in prison on politically-motivated charges, 
according to Human Rights Watch.
Prominent holders of its bonds include BlackRock, AllianceBernstein and Crédit Agricole. ESG and human rights 
are important issues for all three, according to their websites. BlackRock and Crédit Agricole declined to comtries 
ment. AllianceBernstein said no country it does business in "demonstrates policies, strategies and actions that are 
100 per cent ideal or responsible".
Foreign investors have also grown active in China's massive bond market, despite the imposition of a security law 
in Hong Kong and its treatment of the Muslim Uyghur population in Xinjiang province, which the US state 
department has described as "genocide".
Criticised by human rights activists, many fund managers insist that deciding what to do about bonds issued by 
unsavoury regimes is not straightforward. Their mandate is to make money. In a performance-based industry, 
excluding countries over human rights concerns could deny them access to profitable trades.
Putting rights before profits Activists are increasing pressure on asset managers to stop backing regimes that 
abuse their own citizens. But some investors worr....
"We have a core responsibility to generate a return for investors, and a lot of the challenging ESG stories [countries 
ranking poorly on environmental or social measures] have the [highest] yields, which creates a bias to invest," says 
Timothy Ash, senior emerging market sovereign strategist at BlueBay.
And while a country may score badly in one area, it could fare better elsewhere. Ash highlights Saudi Arabia: while 
Prince Mohammed approved a "capture or kill" operation on Khashoggi, according to US intelligence, he has also 
introduced reforms.
Some asset managers believe the scrutiny on them is unfair. "We're not here to measure the extent of human rights 
violations," says the head of emerging market debt at a big global asset manager that holds Belarusian government 
bonds. "We're not going to go to Saudi Arabia and ask them to become a democracy."
Nor would their investors wish them to, he argues. The firm manages money for western pensioners, Middle 
Eastern sovereign wealth funds and wealthy Chinese individuals - to automatically assume a preference for 
democracies would be perverse, he says. "Some investors don't want to invest in coun- that have a problem with 
racism.
Does that mean we shouldn't invest in the US?" he asks.
'Turning a blind eye to abuses' Many fund managers say they are simply deferring to widely-used bond benchmarks 
against which their performance is judged when explaining why they invest in countries with poor human rights 
records.
Belarus remains part of the benchmark JPMorgan emerging market bond index, a broad index of countries 
accessible to investors. Such indices aim to provide a snapshot of investable assets, rather than make moral 
judgments about inclusion. JPMorgan said in April it was considering ejecting Russian bonds because US sanctions 
might render it impractical or illegal to purchase them. Most fund managers take a similar view, preferring to wait 
until sanctions are threatened or in place before selling.
ESG bond indices, which are often based on ratings from specialist firms and which are designed to provide clarity 
on ethical investing, can add to the confusion.
The widely used JPMorgan ESG EMBI Global Diversified index uses ESG scoring and screening "to tilt toward 
issuers ranked higher on ESG criteria and green bond issues, and to underweight and remove issuers that rank 
lower". Its biggest exposure is to the United Arab Emirates at 5.2 per cent. Yet, hundreds of activists, academics 
and lawyers are in prison in the UAE, "in many cases following unfair trials on vague and broad charges", according 
to HRW. Saudi Arabia is the index's third-biggest weighting, while China is also included.
More than 37 per cent of the bonds in the JPMorgan EMBI index are issued by countries labelled "not free" by 
human rights campaign group Freedom House. Even in the ESG version of the index, that figure is 34 per cent.
Some managers have begun to take action themselves. AkademikerPension, a Danish pension fund for academics, 
sold out of Belarus bonds in April on human rights grounds, and now excludes 45 countries, including China, Saudi 
Arabia and Venezuela.
The fund has taken a harder line because its members have made it clear human rights are a priority when 
choosing investments, chief executive Jens Munch Holst says. Even so, working out where to draw the line is 
difficult. "It's a dilemma. Whenever we exclude a country, we always get asked 'why not these other countries too?'" 
he says. "At some point too many exclusions might start to hurt our returns - it hasn't yet."
Although such an approach remains rare, there are increasing signs that other investors are taking notice of human 
rights. Germany's Union Investment decided not to buy Tajikistan's bonds because of abuses. The firm also raised 
the Khashoggi killing with Saudi representatives in 2019 and the dominant role of the military with the Egyptian 
government, says Christian Kopf, head of fixed income and currencies.
Putting rights before profits Activists are increasing pressure on asset managers to stop backing regimes that 
abuse their own citizens. But some investors worr....
But often appeals made to fund managers have little impact. "Certain investors are [turning] a blind eye to human 
rights abuses," says Vytis Jurkonis of Freedom House. "They are contributing to the survival of the regimes."
A detained diplomat's case A poor human rights record also appears to be little barrier to countries building a 
presence in bond markets.
Since the death of authoritarian dictator Islam Karimov in 2016, Uzbekistan, which used to rank alongside North 
Korea for its political rights and civil liberties, has tried to open up to the outside world. President Shavkat 
Mirziyoyev has released political prisoners, lifted exchange controls and encouraged debate. This year the central 
Asian country published its first report on its ESG progress, which said it had introduced laws to enhance civil and 
economic rights and was working to eradicate forced labour in its cotton industry.
Yield-hungry investors have flooded in. A debut eurobond in 2019 and a subsequent issue late last year were 
heavily oversubscribed, raising more than $1.5bn. Blue-chip investors such as T Rowe Price, M&G, Candriam and 
Neuberger Berman bought in.
But concerns are growing over the state of human rights in the country. HRW notes that "grave rights violations, 
including impunity for torture and abuse of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) people, persist" while 
journalists have been "arbitrarily prosecuted".
Kadyr Yusupov, 69, a former highranking Uzbek diplomat convicted of treason by a closed court last year, is one of 
those said to have been mistreated.
In April last year Yusupov raised concerns about prisoner welfare. According to a December 2020 submission to a 
UN working party by Yusupov's son Babur, who says his father was wrongly convicted, the former diplomat was 
threatened and put in a punishment cell.
After two days on hunger strike, Yusupov was transferred to a cell measuring 1.5 metres by 2 metres, containing a 
metal chair and a bed, as well as a torn mattress that was taken away during the day. The toilet was a hole in the 
ground, and the cell was, according to the submission, infested with scorpions and snakes. The filing also details 
alleged psychological torture by Uzbek security services, including threats of sexual violence against him, his wife 
and daughter, and to arrest his sons.
In May the UN working group on arbitrary detention found that Yusupov's imprisonment contravened five articles of 
its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and called for his immediate release. Uzbekistan's ministries of justice 
and foreign affairs did not respond to requests for comment.
"It's been remarkable how people have just said 'we don't really care too much about what's going on politically and 
locally, because the credit is so healthy'," says Max Hess, central Asian fellow at the Foreign Policy Research 
Institute. He points to Uzbekistan's good record on investor relations as being attractive to fund managers.
Investors including Neuberger Berman, Candriam and M&G point to signs of ESG progress in Uzbekistan. 
Neuberger says it is monitoring the situation, "including the case of Mr Yusupov, and should we get more evidence 
that Uzbekistan is regressing on the reform momentum, we would look to reduce our exposure".
Since March 2021, EU rules have required fund managers to disclose how they account for the ESG impacts of 
their investments. And from 2023 they will have to provide details on the human rights records of the countries they 
lend to, boosting transparency.
For some, such pressure cannot come soon enough. Babur Yusupov contacted JPMorgan, which underwrote 
Uzbekistan's bonds, in 2019 shortly after his father's arrest and again on June 23 this year. JPMorgan 
acknowledged his approach in July after the Financial Times contacted it to ask about its involvement in 
Uzbekistan. JPMorgan declined to comment.

Following the UN ruling, the diplomat's son also emailed Aberdeen Standard Investments, an investor in the bonds,

fulfilling our human rights responsibilities requires ongoing engagement and effort to drive positive change".
Babur Yusupov is still waiting for a reply.

Officials were about to shut down his family's hotels and restaurant in the south-eastern city of Gomel, which had 
been giving free food to anti-government protesters. After the warning, Prakofyeu and his wife had time to gather 
just a few belongings before fleeing.
"We packed what we could and drove to Ukraine," says the 28-year-old, who has since linked up with the Belarus 
opposition in exile in Poland. He now spends his time pressuring western companies into ditching their investments 
in his home country. They include an array of asset managers who have funded Lukashenko's authoritarian regime 
by buying Belarusian government debt.
Such divestment campaigns are not new in the world of emerging markets investing, where European and North 
American fund groups frequently use their clients' money to bankroll unsavoury regimes. But they have been given

fresh impetus by the phenomenon of ESG investing - which evaluates investments on environmental, social and 
governance criteria. And by the public attention Belarus has attracted.
Prakofyeu has tried to hold the industry to its promises, writing to asset managers such as BlackRock and UBS to 
ask if owning Belarus' bonds is consistent with their policies, "given that the proceeds support the terroristic regime 
which is involved in gross human rights violations". UBS says it only holds small positions of these bonds.
"All of these companies say 'we're all about ESG and sustainable practices'," Prakofyeu says. "But when it comes 
to their investments, it seems like no one really cares."
Such campaigns have enjoyed isolated success. Even before Belarus' forced grounding of a Ryanair flight in May 
sparked a tightening of US and EU sanctions, a group of Danish asset managers sold all their Belarus government 
debt. Germany's Union Investment has also sold out, while BlueBay Asset Management avoided last year's bond 
sale over human rights concerns. EU sanctions, imposed in June, prevent European investors from buying or 
trading any new Belarusian bonds, but do not affect existing bond holdings.
Many emerging market investors point to a dilemma for the industry: if they steer clear of Belarusian bonds, what 
about other countries with dubious human rights records? Many worry privately it would be hard to make money if 
the likes of Russia, Saudi Arabia or China were off-limits.
"All of the countries in the emerging markets index will have some issue of some kind - there's no perfect way to do 
it," says Richard House, chief investment officer for emerging market debt at Allianz Global Investors. "It's a bit of a 
pandora's box."
Missing out on profitable trades The dilemma over human rights exposes an uncomfortable tension at the heart of 
the ESG boom. Is all the effort spent measuring and evaluating "ESG factors" simply a way to improve returns by 
avoiding some hitherto under-appreciated risks? Or is investing more "sustainably" an end in itself?
Asset managers love to pretend both these goals are in perfect harmony. Logically, that won't always be the case. 
And up to now a poor human rights record has been little barrier to borrowing money from western investors.
Saudi Arabia has successfully sold $32bn of international bonds since the start of 2019, according to data from 
Bond Radar, despite widespread condemnation of the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi linked to Crown 
Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Riyadh's military campaign in neighbouring Yemen. Over the same period 
Russia, under international pressure over events such as its 2014 annexation of Crimea, has raised more than 
$10bn on international bond markets.
Egypt is a very popular holding among emerging market bond managers, even though president Abdel Fattah al-
Sisi's government holds tens of thousands of government critics in prison on politically-motivated charges, 
according to Human Rights Watch.
Prominent holders of its bonds include BlackRock, AllianceBernstein and Crédit Agricole. ESG and human rights 
are important issues for all three, according to their websites. BlackRock and Crédit Agricole declined to comtries 
ment. AllianceBernstein said no country it does business in "demonstrates policies, strategies and actions that are 
100 per cent ideal or responsible".
Foreign investors have also grown active in China's massive bond market, despite the imposition of a security law 
in Hong Kong and its treatment of the Muslim Uyghur population in Xinjiang province, which the US state 
department has described as "genocide".
Criticised by human rights activists, many fund managers insist that deciding what to do about bonds issued by 
unsavoury regimes is not straightforward. Their mandate is to make money. In a performance-based industry, 
excluding countries over human rights concerns could deny them access to profitable trades.
Putting rights before profits Activists are increasing pressure on asset managers to stop backing regimes that 
abuse their own citizens. But some investors worr....
"We have a core responsibility to generate a return for investors, and a lot of the challenging ESG stories [countries 
ranking poorly on environmental or social measures] have the [highest] yields, which creates a bias to invest," says 
Timothy Ash, senior emerging market sovereign strategist at BlueBay.
And while a country may score badly in one area, it could fare better elsewhere. Ash highlights Saudi Arabia: while 
Prince Mohammed approved a "capture or kill" operation on Khashoggi, according to US intelligence, he has also 
introduced reforms.
Some asset managers believe the scrutiny on them is unfair. "We're not here to measure the extent of human rights 
violations," says the head of emerging market debt at a big global asset manager that holds Belarusian government 
bonds. "We're not going to go to Saudi Arabia and ask them to become a democracy."
Nor would their investors wish them to, he argues. The firm manages money for western pensioners, Middle 
Eastern sovereign wealth funds and wealthy Chinese individuals - to automatically assume a preference for 
democracies would be perverse, he says. "Some investors don't want to invest in coun- that have a problem with 
racism.
Does that mean we shouldn't invest in the US?" he asks.
'Turning a blind eye to abuses' Many fund managers say they are simply deferring to widely-used bond benchmarks 
against which their performance is judged when explaining why they invest in countries with poor human rights 
records.
Belarus remains part of the benchmark JPMorgan emerging market bond index, a broad index of countries 
accessible to investors. Such indices aim to provide a snapshot of investable assets, rather than make moral 
judgments about inclusion. JPMorgan said in April it was considering ejecting Russian bonds because US sanctions 
might render it impractical or illegal to purchase them. Most fund managers take a similar view, preferring to wait 
until sanctions are threatened or in place before selling.
ESG bond indices, which are often based on ratings from specialist firms and which are designed to provide clarity 
on ethical investing, can add to the confusion.
The widely used JPMorgan ESG EMBI Global Diversified index uses ESG scoring and screening "to tilt toward 
issuers ranked higher on ESG criteria and green bond issues, and to underweight and remove issuers that rank 
lower". Its biggest exposure is to the United Arab Emirates at 5.2 per cent. Yet, hundreds of activists, academics 
and lawyers are in prison in the UAE, "in many cases following unfair trials on vague and broad charges", according 
to HRW. Saudi Arabia is the index's third-biggest weighting, while China is also included.
More than 37 per cent of the bonds in the JPMorgan EMBI index are issued by countries labelled "not free" by 
human rights campaign group Freedom House. Even in the ESG version of the index, that figure is 34 per cent.
Some managers have begun to take action themselves. AkademikerPension, a Danish pension fund for academics, 
sold out of Belarus bonds in April on human rights grounds, and now excludes 45 countries, including China, Saudi 
Arabia and Venezuela.
The fund has taken a harder line because its members have made it clear human rights are a priority when 
choosing investments, chief executive Jens Munch Holst says. Even so, working out where to draw the line is 
difficult. "It's a dilemma. Whenever we exclude a country, we always get asked 'why not these other countries too?'" 
he says. "At some point too many exclusions might start to hurt our returns - it hasn't yet."
Although such an approach remains rare, there are increasing signs that other investors are taking notice of human 
rights. Germany's Union Investment decided not to buy Tajikistan's bonds because of abuses. The firm also raised 
the Khashoggi killing with Saudi representatives in 2019 and the dominant role of the military with the Egyptian 
government, says Christian Kopf, head of fixed income and currencies.
Putting rights before profits Activists are increasing pressure on asset managers to stop backing regimes that 
abuse their own citizens. But some investors worr....
But often appeals made to fund managers have little impact. "Certain investors are [turning] a blind eye to human 
rights abuses," says Vytis Jurkonis of Freedom House. "They are contributing to the survival of the regimes."
A detained diplomat's case A poor human rights record also appears to be little barrier to countries building a 
presence in bond markets.
Since the death of authoritarian dictator Islam Karimov in 2016, Uzbekistan, which used to rank alongside North 
Korea for its political rights and civil liberties, has tried to open up to the outside world. President Shavkat 
Mirziyoyev has released political prisoners, lifted exchange controls and encouraged debate. This year the central 
Asian country published its first report on its ESG progress, which said it had introduced laws to enhance civil and 
economic rights and was working to eradicate forced labour in its cotton industry.
Yield-hungry investors have flooded in. A debut eurobond in 2019 and a subsequent issue late last year were 
heavily oversubscribed, raising more than $1.5bn. Blue-chip investors such as T Rowe Price, M&G, Candriam and 
Neuberger Berman bought in.
But concerns are growing over the state of human rights in the country. HRW notes that "grave rights violations, 
including impunity for torture and abuse of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) people, persist" while 
journalists have been "arbitrarily prosecuted".
Kadyr Yusupov, 69, a former highranking Uzbek diplomat convicted of treason by a closed court last year, is one of 
those said to have been mistreated.
In April last year Yusupov raised concerns about prisoner welfare. According to a December 2020 submission to a 
UN working party by Yusupov's son Babur, who says his father was wrongly convicted, the former diplomat was 
threatened and put in a punishment cell.
After two days on hunger strike, Yusupov was transferred to a cell measuring 1.5 metres by 2 metres, containing a 
metal chair and a bed, as well as a torn mattress that was taken away during the day. The toilet was a hole in the 
ground, and the cell was, according to the submission, infested with scorpions and snakes. The filing also details 
alleged psychological torture by Uzbek security services, including threats of sexual violence against him, his wife 
and daughter, and to arrest his sons.
In May the UN working group on arbitrary detention found that Yusupov's imprisonment contravened five articles of 
its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and called for his immediate release. Uzbekistan's ministries of justice 
and foreign affairs did not respond to requests for comment.
"It's been remarkable how people have just said 'we don't really care too much about what's going on politically and 
locally, because the credit is so healthy'," says Max Hess, central Asian fellow at the Foreign Policy Research 
Institute. He points to Uzbekistan's good record on investor relations as being attractive to fund managers.
Investors including Neuberger Berman, Candriam and M&G point to signs of ESG progress in Uzbekistan. 
Neuberger says it is monitoring the situation, "including the case of Mr Yusupov, and should we get more evidence 
that Uzbekistan is regressing on the reform momentum, we would look to reduce our exposure".
Since March 2021, EU rules have required fund managers to disclose how they account for the ESG impacts of 
their investments. And from 2023 they will have to provide details on the human rights records of the countries they 
lend to, boosting transparency.
For some, such pressure cannot come soon enough. Babur Yusupov contacted JPMorgan, which underwrote 
Uzbekistan's bonds, in 2019 shortly after his father's arrest and again on June 23 this year. JPMorgan 
acknowledged his approach in July after the Financial Times contacted it to ask about its involvement in 
Uzbekistan. JPMorgan declined to comment.
Putting rights before profits Activists are increasing pressure on asset managers to stop backing regimes that 
abuse their own citizens. But some investors worr....
Following the UN ruling, the diplomat's son also emailed Aberdeen Standard Investments, an investor in the bonds, 
to request help in highlighting the case. In a statement on its website in May the firm said that "as active investors, 
fulfilling our human rights responsibilities requires ongoing engagement and effort to drive positive change".
Babur Yusupov is still waiting for a reply.

 The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest tribunal, threw out a suit initiated by Irish low-cost 
airline Ryanair (RYA.L) challenging Viennese state aid to Austrian Airlines for alleged non-compliance with EU 
rules, media reports said Wednesday.
Ryanair has filed 16 suits against the European Commission for giving the green light to state aid to various airlines, 
including Vienna's decision to grant aid to Austrian Airlines in June 2020. The General Court ruled that the aid was 
compatible with the internal market and is intended to compensate the Lufthansa (LHA.F) unit from damages 
resulting from cancellations and rescheduling due to the pandemic.
Ryanair now has the recourse of an appeal with the EU Court of Justice to challenge the judgment. The airline 
previously won favorable rulings from the General Court in its challenges to state aid granted to Germany's Condor, 
KLM (AF.PA) and TAP, but lost in its challenges to aid for SAS (SAS.ST), Finnair (FIA1S.HE) and Air France.
Ryanair's stock lost over 1% on Wednesday midday.

 Official data showed earlier today that U.K. consumer inflation rose to 2.5 percent in June from 2.1 percent in May. 
The rate was forecast to climb to 2.2 percent.
 The annual growth was largely driven by prices of food, second-hand cars and clothing and footwear.
 On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.5 percent, following a 0.6 percent rise in May. The expected rate 
was 0.2 percent.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 dropped 35 points, or half a percent, to 7,089 after closing marginally lower on Tuesday.
 Travel & leisure stocks were losing ground, with TUI tumbling 4 percent on reports the world's largest holiday 
company has cancelled more holidays until August.
 easyJet dropped 1.6 percent, Ryanair Holdings shed 0.6 percent and British Airways owner IAG lost 1.2 percent on 
worries over the Delta variant's spread in the continent.

Staffing up Ryanair 's plan to hire pilots bucks trend

Ryanair is planning to hire 2,000 pilots over the next three years in one of the aviation industry's biggest recruitment 
drives since the start of the pandemic.
The hiring spree will add to the current roster of 5,000 pilots at Europe's largest airline. It is also aiming to increase 
annual passenger numbers more than a third over pre-pandemic levels within three years.
"We are ... planning for a return to growth as we recover from the Covid-19 crisis and grow to 200m guests by 
financial year 2024," said Darrell Hughes, people director at Ryanair.
In May last year, the airline warned it would need to cut 3,000 jobs, however it has managed not to make any of its 
pilots redundant during the pandemic. Some cabin crew have lost their jobs.
But pilots agreed a 20 per cent cut to pay, which will be restored to original levels over four years. Ryanair said it 
needed more pilots for its new Boeing 737 Max jets - the first delivery of its order of more than 210 arrived last 
month. They should help the company reduce fuel use, carbon emissions and costs.
Ryanair's investments in planes and staff contrast with difficulties elsewhere in the industry. As of April, more than 
18,000 pilot jobs are threatened or have been lost during the pandemic, according to the European Cockpit 
Association.
Ryanair is betting on pent-up demand when curbs on overseas travel ease. Chief executive Michael O'Leary 
reckons rivals will be unable to meet that demand, forecasting a 20 per cent fall in the number of short-haul seats 
available in Europe in the next few years. Harry Dempsey

Jul 13, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Spirit Airlines SAVE[1] announced that it intends to expand its operations at Orlando International 
Airport (MCO). With the plan in place to operate its largest-ever Orlando schedule, the carrier expects to provide 
more than 80 daily departures from MCO by 2021 end. 
With air-travel demand picking up in the United States, American Airlines AAL[2] too announced an expansion plan. 
The carrier aims to fortify its footprint in Miami, FL with two international destinations and six domestic routes, slated 
for launch this winter. 
European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] announced plans to hire more than 2,000 pilots over the next three 
years as it modernizes its fleet and gradually recovers from the COVID-led setback. In an investor update, 
management at Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[4] projected second-quarter 2021 load factor (% of seats 
filled by passengers) to be 85.1%. Detailed results will be out on Jul 29. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important 
Stories 1. On materialization, Spirit Airlines' robust expansion plan, which was announced at MCO, will make the 
carrier the largest international airline in Orlando. On an overall basis, the impending extension will make the airline 
the second-largest carrier operating out of MCO. Its Orlando operations will be 45% above the schedule at the end 
of 2019 following the activation of new and resumed routes[5]. 
Spirit Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. As part of its fleet-modernization plans, Ryanair announced that it took delivery of the first fuel-efficient Boeing 
737-8200 Gamechanger aircraft. The carrier intends to take delivery of more than 210 Boeing 737-8200 
Gamechanger aircraft over the next three years. With these anticipated additions to its fleet, the carrier looks to 
boost its work force. It hopes to continue its recovery from the coronavirus-induced damage and fly 200 million 
passengers by the fiscal year 2024. 
We remind investors that Ryanair's June traffic was impressive as wide-spread vaccination in addition to the easing 
of restrictions in the EU led to an uptick in air-travel demand as was mentioned in the previous week's write-up[7]. 
3 As part of its expansion plan in Miami, American Airlines intends to begin services to Chetumal, Mexico and San 
Andres Island, Colombia from Miami International Airport this December. Following this addition, the Fort Worth, 
TX-based carrier will serve 28 destinations in Mexico and seven in Colombia. Flights to Chetumal and San Andres 
Airline Stock Roundup: SAVE 's Route Additions, Gol 's Investor Update & More
Island will operate on Wednesdays and Saturdays. While the Chetumal service will begin on Dec 1, the San Andres 
Island flights will commence from Dec 4[8]. 
4. Gol Linhas expects second-quarter EBITDA margin (excluding special items) in the band of 16-18%. Passenger 
unit revenues for the June quarter are expected to be approximately 17% lower than the year-ago reported number. 
Non-fuel unit costs in the to-be-reported quarter (excluding non-operating and non-recurring expenses) are 
expected to decrease roughly 55% from the prior-year reported number. Total capacity (measured in available seat 
kilometers) is expected to increase roughly 307% from the second-quarter 2020 reported level. Strong seasonal 
demand is expected to drive the third-quarter capacity to 80% above the June-quarter reading. 
5. At Azul AZUL[9], June's consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers, increased 18.2% month 
over month. With travel demand rising, capacity moved up 16.8% in June from the May tally. Since traffic surge was 
more than capacity expansion, load factor rose to 76.8% in June from 75.8% in May[10]. Performance The following 
table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows most airline stocks have traded in the red over the past week even though the losses were 
muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has been more or less flat over the past five trading 
days. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated13%. What's Next in 
the Airline Space? Investors will keenly await the second-quarter 2021 earnings report of Delta Air Lines DAL[11] 
on Jul 14. 
 Bitcoin, Like the Internet Itself, Could Change Everything  
 Blockchain and cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it 
the 'Internet of Money' and predict it could change the way money works forever. If true, it could do to banks what 
Netflix did to Blockbuster and Amazon did to Sears. Experts agree we're still in the early stages of this technology, 
and as it grows, it will create several investing opportunities.

and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly. See 3 crypto-related stocks

Romania 's Blue Air plans London listing in challenge to Ryanair and Wizz Air
Romania's Blue Air plans London listing in challenge to Ryanair and Wizz

Blue Air, a Romanian budget airline, is planning a float on London's AIM market later this year which could see it 
reach a valuation of up to half a billion pounds.
The Bucharest-based airline is planning to list through a reverse takeover of cash shell Ridgecrest PLC 
(LON:RDGC), whose shares were suspended on Monday morning after agreeing to the deal with Blue Air's parent 
Airline Invest SA.
READ: Ryanair and Wizz Air passenger numbers bounce back in June
Blue Air is aiming to raise up to (EURO)250mln (£214mln) through the listing, according to the Times, which will 
then be used to expand its existing fleet of 15 aircraft to around 50 over the next five years, all of which will be 
Boeing Co's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes, which despite their controversial history have been touted as highly fuel-
efficient.
While it has bases in Bucharest and the Italian city of Turin, Blue Air has managed to pick up slots at London 
Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol and Frankfurt during the pandemic, which caused havoc 
in the airline industry and led to the collapse of some weaker competitors.
The company may be aiming to replicate the success of fellow Easter European carrier Wizz Air Holdings PLC 
(LON:WIZZ), which is currently the fastest-growing airline in the continent and is seen by many as a key challenger 
to Irish budget behemoth Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA).
Romania 's Blue Air plans London listing in challenge to Ryanair and Wizz Air
Blue Air may also be looking to time its debut on the public markets in line with an expected rebound in air travel as 
pandemic travel restrictions are eased, particularly with the UK government recently announcing that double-
vaccinated passengers returning from countries on its 'Amber' list will not need to quarantine for 10 days.
Signs of an uptick in passenger numbers were already being noted by the airlines last month, with both Ryanair and 
Wizz Air reporting massive jumps in customers in June.

Ryanair has announced a recruitment drive for 2,000 new pilots to crew aircraft deliveries over the next three years 
as Ryanair recovers and rebuilds from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ryanair has now taken delivery of its first Boeing 737-8200 Gamechanger aircraft, which help Ryanair lower costs, 
cut fuel consumption and lower noise and CO2 emissions. This investment in new aircraft arriving through the 
recovery phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic deepens Ryanair's environmental commitment as Europe's greenest, 
cleanest major airline and creates these exciting opportunities for experienced and aspiring pilots to secure the best 
pilot jobs in aviation. Ryanair Pilots enjoy great pay, industry leading five on, four off rosters, outstanding career 
development and world class training. As part of Ryanair's career development initiatives, most Captain vacancies 
created by these new aircraft deliveries will be filled by internal promotions which creates opportunities for 
replacement First Officers, and ultimately new cadet pilots who can kickstart their pilot career with Ryanair so they 
can grow into the next generation of Ryanair's First Officers and Captains.
Training courses take place through 2021 to be ready for Summer 2022 for positions all over Europe. Ryanair has 
partnered with Airline Flight Academy in Dublin to deliver Boeing 737 Training Courses as part of this recruitment 
drive.
Ryanair's People Director Darrell Hughes said: "As we take delivery of more than 210 Boeing 737-8200 
gamechanger aircraft, Ryanair will recruit 2,000+ pilots over the next three years to fill positions created by this 
growth. This is great news for experienced and aspiring pilots but also for our own pilots who will enjoy fast tracked 
promotions. Throughout the pandemic, Ryanair has worked closely with our people to save jobs and we are 
delighted to start planning for a return to growth over the coming years as we recover from the COVID-19 crisis and 
grow to 200m guests by FY2024''.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) announced plans to hire 2,000 new pilots to crew aircraft deliveries over the next 
three years.
The budget carrier said the investment in new aircraft, such as the 'greener' Boeing 737-8200 Gamechanger, has 
created an opportunity to take in new staff as it rebuilds from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most captain vacancies will be filled by internal promotions of first officers, who will then be replaced by new cadet 
pilots.
Training courses will take place this year so the new hires will be ready for Summer 2022 for positions all over 
Europe.
The Irish airline has partnered with Airline Flight Academy in Dublin for the courses.
Last year, the group said it would cut 3,000 jobs but the plan was scrapped after unions agreed to cut salaries of 
pilots and cabin crews to avoid redundancies.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday set out a plan to recruit 2,000 new pilots over the next three 
years for new aircraft deliveries to recover from the damage done from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Captain vacancies created by these new aircraft deliveries are expected to be filled by internal promotions, which 
will allow for replacement First Officers and new cadet pilots.
Ryanair has now taken delivery of its first Boeing 737-8200 Gamechanger aircraft, which is expected to help the 
Swords-based low cost airline reduce costs, cut fuel consumption and lower noise and CO2 emissions. 
"Ryanair has worked closely with our people to save jobs and we are delighted to start planning for a return to 
growth over the coming years as we recover from the Covid-19 crisis and grow to 200 million guests by FY2024," 
said People Director Darrell Hughes.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.1% at EUR16.05 in London on Monday afternoon.

Wizz challenges king of Europe's skies in battle for budget carrier crown; 
Airlines. Low-cost competition Hungarian operator plans to benefit from

For years, Michael O'Leary has been king of Europe's skies. He expanded Ryanair from a low-cost upstart into the 
region's dominant airline by offering cheap fares through an ultra-efficient model that rivals could not match.
But when the aviation industry emerges from the pandemic, O'Leary will have competition. Hungarian carrier Wizz 
Air has an equally low-cost business and is set on continuing breakneck expansion and moving further into western 
Europe.
While the rest of their sector crumbles, O'Leary and Wizz Air chief executive József Váradi have spent the past year 
touting opportunities. Both airlines are taking on new aircraft, scooping up take-off and landing slots and opening 
new bases, while rivals with weaker balance sheets such as Alitalia and Norwegian Air Shuttle retrench or collapse.
Neither Ryanair nor Wizz Air is immune from the impact of the pandemic. They have bled hundreds of millions of 
euros over the past year. But their shares have recovered from heavy losses and are close to all-time highs, a sign 
that investors agree that low-cost is the future of European aviation.
For O'Leary it was "the greatest growth opportunity" in Ryanair's 35- year history. He expected a 20 per cent fall in 
short-haul seats available from rivals in Europe over the next few years.
Wizz challenges king of Europe's skies in battle for budget carrier crown Airlines. Low-cost competition 
Hungarian operator plans to benefit from collapse of ri....
Váradi said: "We think we are going to be a much ... more competitive airline and more formidable competing 
force."
The scale of Wizz's ambition was revealed last week when shareholders were asked to back a plan that hands 
Váradi a £100m bonus if he lifts the stock from £48 to £120 over the next five years. That would give it a market 
capitalisation of nearly £12bn, a third smaller than Ryanair's now.
The company listed in London at £11.50 in 2015, but its shares have increased sharply as investors welcome the 
first serious low-cost competition to Ryanair to emerge and "the last great growth story in European aviation", 
according to Bernstein aviation analyst Daniel Roeska.
Váradi masterminded Wizz's growth. A background as an economist and a career at Procter & Gamble and the now 
defunct Hungarian flag carrier
Malév behind him, he approached US investor Bill Franke in 2004 with a plan for a regional airline. Franke, one of 
history's most successful aviation investors and an early backer of Ryanair, persuaded him to adopt the low-cost 
model, and within six weeks Váradi had presented him with a new plan.
Franke said: "I liked József. He is a smart guy, a direct guy, and we ended up making an investment. It has been a 
very successful model, and we have for a private equity fund been unusually long-tenured ... We are now at 17 
years and it has been a significantly favourable investment."
Wizz's structure, with a London listing, Hungarian base for cheap labour and Swiss tax registration, has left it the 
only airline to be able to match, and in some places beat, Ryanair's model.
London-listed easyJet competes with legacy carriers at expensive airports and is not considered ultra-lowcost, while 
airlines such as British Airways are more reliant on long-haul and business travel.
Both Ryanair and Wizz claim to have the lowest unit cost in the industry, but Bernstein analysts believe Wizz has 
the edge. O'Leary calls that "bullshit" based on theoretical future fleets.
Wizz's growth has been fuelled by stimulating demand for flying and connecting cities in central and eastern 
Europe, where analysts see opportunities. It has moved into parts of western Europe, and has opened UK bases. 
But to hit his target, Váradi will have to move further onto Ryanair's turf.
"The jury is still out. Wizz is being more aggressive in bringing capacity back in this year, but they are not filling it to

O'Leary said Wizz had a "reasonably compelling" growth story. He respected the way Váradi ran the business, and 
saw "niches" for Wizz. But it could not challenge his dominant position.
"To be fair, they are good on this schlock about, 'Oh, you know, we've got lower costs than Ryanair, and therefore 
ultimately we're going to replicate Ryanair returns over the last 20 years.' ... The real difficulty for the Wizz model is 
that they can't explain how the hell you can expand dramatically in western Europe when Ryanair is already there."
While Wizz plans to take on new aircraft to expand its fleet from about 140 to 270 planes, O'Leary has an order for 
more than 200 aircraft from Boeing, which he pointed out was "the same size as Wizz's whole bloody fleet" and 
would leave Ryanair with 600 planes by 2026.
Váradi has been briefing investors that there is space for both to grow. "I think the real question is what is going to 
happen to the others who don't have the cost base and the capacity to grow," he said.
"I am sure Ryanair will do great coming out of the pandemic, but I think we will be doing even better."

For years, Michael O'Leary has been king of Europe's skies. He expanded Ryanair from a low-cost upstart into the 
region's dominant airline by offering cheap fares through an ultra-efficient model that rivals could not match.
But when the aviation industry emerges from the pandemic, O'Leary will have competition. Hungarian carrier Wizz 
Air has an equally low-cost business and is set on continuing breakneck expansion and moving further into western 
Europe.
While the rest of their sector crumbles, O'Leary and Wizz Air chief executive József Váradi have spent the past year 
touting opportunities. Both airlines are taking on new aircraft, scooping up take-off and landing slots and opening 
new bases, while rivals with weaker balance sheets such as Alitalia and Norwegian Air Shuttle retrench or collapse.
Neither Ryanair nor Wizz Air is immune from the impact of the pandemic. They have bled hundreds of millions of 
euros over the past year. But their shares have recovered from heavy losses and are close to all-time highs, a sign 
that investors agree that low-cost is the future of European aviation.
For O'Leary it was "the greatest growth opportunity" in Ryanair's 35- year history. He expected a 20 per cent fall in 
short-haul seats available from rivals in Europe over the next few years.

Váradi said: "We think we are going to be a much ... more competitive airline and more formidable competing 
force."
The scale of Wizz's ambition was revealed last week when shareholders were asked to back a plan that hands 
Váradi a £100m bonus if he lifts the stock from £48 to £120 over the next five years. That would give it a market 
capitalisation of nearly £12bn, a third smaller than Ryanair's now.
The company listed in London at £11.50 in 2015, but its shares have increased sharply as investors welcome the 
first serious low-cost competition to Ryanair to emerge and "the last great growth story in European aviation", 
according to Bernstein aviation analyst Daniel Roeska.
Váradi masterminded Wizz's growth. A background as an economist and a career at Procter & Gamble and the now 
defunct Hungarian flag carrier
Malév behind him, he approached US investor Bill Franke in 2004 with a plan for a regional airline. Franke, one of 
history's most successful aviation investors and an early backer of Ryanair, persuaded him to adopt the low-cost 
model, and within six weeks Váradi had presented him with a new plan.
Franke said: "I liked József. He is a smart guy, a direct guy, and we ended up making an investment. It has been a 
very successful model, and we have for a private equity fund been unusually long-tenured ... We are now at 17 
years and it has been a significantly favourable investment."
Wizz's structure, with a London listing, Hungarian base for cheap labour and Swiss tax registration, has left it the 
only airline to be able to match, and in some places beat, Ryanair's model.
London-listed easyJet competes with legacy carriers at expensive airports and is not considered ultra-lowcost, while 
airlines such as British Airways are more reliant on long-haul and business travel.
Both Ryanair and Wizz claim to have the lowest unit cost in the industry, but Bernstein analysts believe Wizz has 
the edge. O'Leary calls that "bullshit" based on theoretical future fleets.
Wizz's growth has been fuelled by stimulating demand for flying and connecting cities in central and eastern 
Europe, where analysts see opportunities. It has moved into parts of western Europe, and has opened UK bases. 
But to hit his target, Váradi will have to move further onto Ryanair's turf.
"The jury is still out. Wizz is being more aggressive in bringing capacity back in this year, but they are not filling it to 
the extent Ryanair is," said aviation consultant Edmond Rose.
O'Leary said Wizz had a "reasonably compelling" growth story. He respected the way Váradi ran the business, and 
saw "niches" for Wizz. But it could not challenge his dominant position.
"To be fair, they are good on this schlock about, 'Oh, you know, we've got lower costs than Ryanair, and therefore 
ultimately we're going to replicate Ryanair returns over the last 20 years.' ... The real difficulty for the Wizz model is
