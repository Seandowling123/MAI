During a pandemic that has wreaked havoc with global travel, Enrique Beltranena is something of a rarity: a happy 
airline boss.
Volaris, his Mexican low-cost airline, has added routes during the crisis, has a healthy balance sheet and is 
"cautiously optimistic" in its outlook, he said.
But with three leading carriers forced into bankruptcy protection and another three halting operations altogether 
because of the pandemic, Latin America is staring at a difficult future for its industry and the likelihood that travel 
options will be permanently reduced.
The region that remains the centre of the pandemic - with nearly 40 per cent of daily deaths - sucks up money from 
tourism in a normal year. This year is exceptionally bad and likely to remain so, with travellers escaping the 
northern hemisphere winter expected to stay away, in part because of restrictions on flights to Europe from all Latin 
American countries except Uruguay.
"What all this process is going to do is delay growth [of the industry] in the region," said Pablo Ceriani, president of 
Aerolíneas Argentinas.
Latin America carriers face empty runways as tourists stay home Airlines. Flight restrictions Some providers 
collapse while others call halt to operations in re....
Peter Cerda, vice-president for the Americas at the International Air Transport Association (Iata) believes many 
regional airlines will come out of the crisis smaller and operating fewer flights. "That will limit opening new 
destinations," he said.
He expects it will take until 2024 for international flights to recover to prepandemic levels and that even domestic 
routes will take until 2023 to pick up.
Within the region, people will start to travel again, especially to visit friends and family, but they are unlikely to 
journey far. "Long-haul business travel will take longer to recover," Mr Cerda said.
Stephen Trent, director of Americas airline research at Citi, said Mexico, Central America and Colombia remained 
"within short-haul international flight range from the US" but for the south of the continent, "it's a different issue ... 
maybe now there'll be sparser choices for example for flights from the US to Buenos Aires". Flights between Latin 
America and Europe and Asia are also likely to be less frequent.
Short-term, Mr Trent said, low-cost airlines with smaller balance sheets, less debt and lower fixed costs would have 
an advantage, if demand for shorter routes recovers more quickly.
Volaris is one such potential winner. It had overtaken Mexican flag carrier Aeroméxico as the country's largest 
airline in passenger numbers even before the pandemic and its cost per available seat mile, a metric used to 
measure efficiency, is roughly a sixth of Aeroméxico and Copa Airlines, Panama's flag carrier.
Mr Beltranena prides his airline on having the third-lowest unit cost in the world, behind Budapest-based Wizz Air 
and Malaysia's AirAsia, and on a par with Ireland's Ryanair. All its 84 aircraft are leased, it has $436m in cash and 
no debt to repay before June 2020. At the end of this year, it hopes to be back to 85 per cent of capacity, he added.
"We've had to open new routes - five domestic and five international," he said of Volaris, which floated in 2013. 
"The next five to six months are going to be defining for Latin American airlines but Volaris will be one of the big 
winners."
Covid struck Latin America at the end of February, prompting travel restrictions in some countries with dramatic 
consequences. In Mexico, for example, the number of international carriers serving Latin America's second-biggest 
economy nearly halved between April and July, from 64 to 34, according to the country's federal civil aviation 
agency.
Few regional airlines have the liquidity to weather more than seven months of low or no income, Mr Cerda said. As 
a result, the biggest, LATAM, as well as Colombia's Avianca and Aeroméxico, have all filed for Chapter 11 
protection from creditors and face painful restructurings that will slash their capacity. "With Chapter 11, you typically 
gain operating efficiencies but your footprint shrinks significantly," Mr Trent said.
Some have fared even worse: LATAM's Argentina operations, as well as TAME in Ecuador and Caribbean airline 
Liat, have ceased operations altogether.
Few Latin American carriers have had access to state aid, receiving just 1 per cent of the $130bn in government 
bailouts offered worldwide, said Mr Cerda, "and of that 1 per cent, only two countries stepped up - Brazil and 
Colombia". Brazil offered aid to Azul, which is still evaluating whether to accept. A Colombian bailout for Avianca 
has been held up in court after a member of the public filed a lawsuit arguing the company was in financial trouble 
even before the pandemic and it would be reckless to lend heavily to it now.
Declan Ryan, co-founder of Ryanair and executive chairman of low-cost carrier Viva Air Colombia, said his airline 
had been offered a loan scheme adding only up to $25m to $27m, despite having a 20 per cent share of the market.
"We're not disrespectful of that but it's about 7 per cent of what Avianca's getting," he told the Financial Times. "Do 
we feel pissed off? We do ... I wouldn't rule out us doing something on the legal front. It's not my style ... but we're a

very big foreign direct investment company and you have to treat your FDI companies fairly. This is anti-
competitive. It makes Colombia look like a banana republic."
In Argentina, Aerolíneas has received "a bit more state subsidy" during the pandemic but had still had to put fleet 
upgrades on hold, Mr Ceriani said.
Flybondi and JetSmart, two budget rivals, have warned they risk going out of business because of the country's 
lockdown which has halted most flights.
"I don't know if we'll have winners," Mr Ceriani said. "We will have survivors."

During a pandemic that has wreaked havoc with global travel, Enrique Beltranena is something of a rarity: a happy 
airline boss.
Volaris, his Mexican low-cost airline, has added routes during the crisis, has a healthy balance sheet and is 
"cautiously optimistic" in its outlook, he said.
But with three leading carriers forced into bankruptcy protection and another three halting operations altogether 
because of the pandemic, Latin America is staring at a difficult future for its industry and the likelihood that travel 
options will be permanently reduced.
The region that remains the centre of the pandemic - with nearly 40 per cent of daily deaths - sucks up money from 
tourism in a normal year. This year is exceptionally bad and likely to remain so, with travellers escaping the 
northern hemisphere winter expected to stay away, in part because of restrictions on flights to Europe from all Latin 
American countries except Uruguay.
"What all this process is going to do is delay growth [of the industry] in the region," said Pablo Ceriani, president of 
Aerolíneas Argentinas.
Latin America carriers face empty runways as tourists stay home Airlines. Flight restrictions Some providers 
collapse while others call halt to operations in re....
Peter Cerda, vice-president for the Americas at the International Air Transport Association (Iata) believes many 
regional airlines will come out of the crisis smaller and operating fewer flights. "That will limit opening new 
destinations," he said.
He expects it will take until 2024 for international flights to recover to prepandemic levels and that even domestic 
routes will take until 2023 to pick up.
Within the region, people will start to travel again, especially to visit friends and family, but they are unlikely to 
journey far. "Long-haul business travel will take longer to recover," Mr Cerda said.
Stephen Trent, director of Americas airline research at Citi, said Mexico, Central America and Colombia remained 
"within short-haul international flight range from the US" but for the south of the continent, "it's a different issue ... 
maybe now there'll be sparser choices for example for flights from the US to Buenos Aires". Flights between Latin 
America and Europe and Asia are also likely to be less frequent.
Short-term, Mr Trent said, low-cost airlines with smaller balance sheets, less debt and lower fixed costs would have 
an advantage, if demand for shorter routes recovers more quickly.
Volaris is one such potential winner. It had overtaken Mexican flag carrier Aeroméxico as the country's largest 
airline in passenger numbers even before the pandemic and its cost per available seat mile, a metric used to 
measure efficiency, is roughly a sixth of Aeroméxico and Copa Airlines, Panama's flag carrier.
Mr Beltranena prides his airline on having the third-lowest unit cost in the world, behind Budapest-based Wizz Air 
and Malaysia's AirAsia, and on a par with Ireland's Ryanair. All its 84 aircraft are leased, it has $436m in cash and 
no debt to repay before June 2020. At the end of this year, it hopes to be back to 85 per cent of capacity, he added.
"We've had to open new routes - five domestic and five international," he said of Volaris, which floated in 2013. 
"The next five to six months are going to be defining for Latin American airlines but Volaris will be one of the big 
winners."
Covid struck Latin America at the end of February, prompting travel restrictions in some countries with dramatic 
consequences. In Mexico, for example, the number of international carriers serving Latin America's second-biggest 
economy nearly halved between April and July, from 64 to 34, according to the country's federal civil aviation 
agency.
Few regional airlines have the liquidity to weather more than seven months of low or no income, Mr Cerda said. As 
a result, the biggest, LATAM, as well as Colombia's Avianca and Aeroméxico, have all filed for Chapter 11 
protection from creditors and face painful restructurings that will slash their capacity. "With Chapter 11, you typically 
gain operating efficiencies but your footprint shrinks significantly," Mr Trent said.
Some have fared even worse: LATAM's Argentina operations, as well as TAME in Ecuador and Caribbean airline 
Liat, have ceased operations altogether.
Few Latin American carriers have had access to state aid, receiving just 1 per cent of the $130bn in government 
bailouts offered worldwide, said Mr Cerda, "and of that 1 per cent, only two countries stepped up - Brazil and 
Colombia". Brazil offered aid to Azul, which is still evaluating whether to accept. A Colombian bailout for Avianca 
has been held up in court after a member of the public filed a lawsuit arguing the company was in financial trouble 
even before the pandemic and it would be reckless to lend heavily to it now.
Declan Ryan, co-founder of Ryanair and executive chairman of low-cost carrier Viva Air Colombia, said his airline 
had been offered a loan scheme adding only up to $25m to $27m, despite having a 20 per cent share of the market.
"We're not disrespectful of that but it's about 7 per cent of what Avianca's getting," he told the Financial Times. "Do 
we feel pissed off? We do ... I wouldn't rule out us doing something on the legal front. It's not my style ... but we're a

very big foreign direct investment company and you have to treat your FDI companies fairly. This is anti-
competitive. It makes Colombia look like a banana republic."
In Argentina, Aerolíneas has received "a bit more state subsidy" during the pandemic but had still had to put fleet 
upgrades on hold, Mr Ceriani said.
Flybondi and JetSmart, two budget rivals, have warned they risk going out of business because of the country's 
lockdown which has halted most flights.
"I don't know if we'll have winners," Mr Ceriani said. "We will have survivors."

Ryanair has reduced its winter flight schedule further as the outlook for the sector darkens.
The carrier intends to fly 40 per cent of last year's schedule between November and March, down from a previously 
planned 60 per cent, following a sharp fall in bookings.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, blamed "government mismanagement of EU air travel" as quarantine restrictions 
weaken demand.
"Our focus continues to be on maintaining as large a schedule as we can sensibly operate to keep our aircraft, our 
pilots and our cabin crew employed while minimising job losses," he said.
Ryanair stock closed down 4.1 per cent in London while other European airline stocks also came under pressure.
Shares in rival carrier EasyJet declined 3 per cent.
Ryanair has been forced to cut flights after bookings failed to materialise in expected numbers.
Airlines are usually able to predict long-term demand and adjust schedules well in advance. But this year the 
industry has been forced into regular changes to match planes to erratic bookings influenced by quarantine 
measures.
By trimming its schedule, Ryanair intends to save costs by ensuring its planes are at least 70 per cent full.
Ryanair makes more cuts to winter capacity; Airlines
EasyJet will fly only 25 per cent of last year's capacity in the final three months of this year, while Wizz Air has cut 
schedules and expects to fly 50 per cent of last year's flights through the winter.
In September, BA said it was running between 25 and 30 per cent of its normal schedule. It is badly exposed to 
longhaul and corporate travel.
The airline carried 5.1m passengers in September, a third of last year's number. It expects to carry 38m passengers 
this financial year, which began in April, down from the 60m forecast in July.
Ryanair has a strong balance sheet and many analysts expect it to increase market share eventually.
The airline had enough liquidity to survive more than 20 months in current conditions, and longer if it began selling 
its aircraft, according to Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy.
O'Leary put the blame on state 'mismanagement' of EU air travel as virus curbs weaken demand

Ryanair has slashed its winter flight schedule further as the outlook for the industry darkens.
The airline intends to fly 40 per cent of last year's schedule between November and March, down from a planned 
60 per cent.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, blamed the cuts on "government mismanagement of EU air travel".
He said: "Our focus continues to be on maintaining as large a schedule as we can sensibly operate to keep our 
aircraft, our pilots and our cabin crew employed while minimising job losses."
Ryanair stock was flat yesterday while others in the Europe sector were pressed, with easyJet down 3.3 per cent.
Ryanair has been forced to cut flights after passenger bookings failed to materialise in expected numbers.
Airlines are usually able to project long-term passenger demand with precision, and adjust schedules well in 
advance. But this year the industry has been forced into regular changes to match planes to erratic bookings 
influenced by quarantine measures and the resurgence of the virus in Europe.
By trimming its schedule, Ryanair intends to ensure its planes are at least 70 per cent full to help save costs.
EasyJet will fly only 25 per cent of last year's capacity in the final three months of this year, while Hungarian low-
cost carrier Wizz Air has cut schedules and expects to fly 50 per cent of last year's flights through the winter.
Ryanair makes more cuts to winter capacity Airlines
In September, BA said it was running 25 to 30 per cent of its normal schedule. It is exposed to long-haul and 
corporate travel, which have been hit hardest. The airline carried 5.1m passengers in September, a third of last 
year's number. It expects to carry 38m passengers this financial year, which began in April, down from the 60m 
forecast in July.
Ryanair has a strong balance sheet and many analysts expect the airline to increase its share of the market 
eventually, given its low costs and the weak state of some of its competitors.
The airline has enough available liquidity to survive more than 20 months in the current conditions, and longer if it 
began selling its aircraft, according to Stephen Furlong, an aviation analyst at Davy.

London Low-cost airline Ryanair slipped after saying it would cut its winter schedule to 40 per cent of last year's 
between November and March, down from plans to run at 60 per cent.
British Airways owner IAG and easyJet followed the carrier lower.
Pub group Marston's dropped after announcing 2,150 job cuts with the latest government restrictions on trading in 
pubs and bars hitting consumer confidence.
The tougher measures knocked foodto-go group Greencore, transport operator FirstGroup and retailers Dunelm, 
Burberry and Frasers Group.
AO World, the online market for household appliances, surged after proving itself to be one of the lockdown 
winners.
The group expected its first-half sales to September 30 would rise nearly 60 per cent from a year earlier to about 
£715m as the pandemic encouraged consumers stuck at home to buy their washing machines and dishwashers 
online.
Rolls-Royce powered ahead after releasing final pricing details for its bond offering, which was upsized to £2bn.
The coupons were not as expensive as some had feared and received strong demand, bolstering its chances of 
pushing through its £5bn financing package. Harry Dempsey

between November and March, down from plans to run at 60 per cent.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-slashes-flights-as-second-wave-engulfs-europe/Ryanair is going into 
hibernation for the winter, operating just two in five of its scheduled services as the second wave of the pandemic 
envelops the European economy.Job losses were inevitable, Europe's busiest airline said. It carried 150 million 
passengers a year on short-haul services before the pandemic, with its trademark lack of in-flight hospitality, but 
said it would be cutting the schedule from 60 per cent to 40 per cent[1] through to March. 
The decision is effectively a running-up of the white flag by Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, 
who during the initial lockdowns and fleet grounding in the spring confidently targeted flying 100 million passengers 
this year on a schedule running at 80 per cent capacity. He has now said he is aiming to break even and minimise 
cash burn by carrying 38 million passengers on a winter flight schedule running at 40 per cent, with planes 
operating 70 per cent full compared with the 90 per cent-plus it ordinarily targets. 'These winter schedule cuts have 
been forced upon us by government mismanagement of European Union air travel,' he said. He added that 
Ryanair's capacity could be 'further revised downwards if EU governments continue to mismanage air travel and 
impose more lockdowns this winter'. Its main rival at the budget end of the European short-haul market, Easyjet, 
has said it has cut capacity to 25 per cent through to the turn of the year after reporting that it expects to have lost 
at least 1.25 billion in its financial year to the end of September. Mr O'Leary urged member states of the EU to act 
as one in adapting the European Commission's proposed air travel 'traffic light system', which envisages 
unrestricted travel between countries and regions where there are fewer than 50 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 
people. Ad hoc restrictions between countries had, Ryanair said, caused forward bookings to weaken. It said its 
capacity-cut would be affected by continuing to run as much as 65 per cent of its routes but with reduced 
frequencies. Aircraft are being withdrawn altogether from its two west of Ireland bases at Cork and Shannon and 
also from Toulouse in southern France, with other aircraft being mothballed across Belgium, Germany, Spain, 
Portugal and Austria. Ryanair said at the outset of the pandemic that it expected to make 3,000 people redundant. 
That figure was revised downwards as pilots and crew accepted pay cuts and unpaid leave during the summer, but 
it will now rise again. 'It is inevitable,' Mr O'Leary said, 'given the scale of these cutbacks that we will be 
implementing more unpaid leave and job sharing this winter in those bases where we have agreed reduced working 
time and pay. 'This is a better short-term outcome than mass job losses. There will regrettably be more 
redundancies at those small number of cabin crew bases where we have still not secured agreement on working

time and pay cuts.' Having halved from its early 2020 high of more than €16 each, Ryanair stock had clawed its way 
back to nearly €13. Shares closed last night down 4.3 per cent at €11.77. Read more: Ryanair slashes flights as

Ryanair blames European 'mismanagement' for winter cuts
Ryanair blames European 'mismanagement' for winter cuts

 LONDON (AP) — Ryanair became the latest European airline to announce big reductions in its winter schedule 
after coronavirus-related travel restrictions were reimposed across the continent.
Casting the blame on European governments for “mishandling” air travel during the pandemic, the Ireland-based 
budget airline said Thursday that it will cut around a third of its flight routes this winter.
It said demand for flights has been “heavily curtailed” to and from the U.K., Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Portugal and 
much of central Europe.
The airline said it will maintain up to 65% of its route network between November and March and will close its bases 
in the Irish cities of Cork and Shannon, and Toulouse in France through the period. The routes that continue 
operating will see fewer flights.
Overall, the airline said its winter capacity will be 40% of what it was a year earlier, compared with the 60% it had 
previously pencilled in. It also said it expects to fill 70% of seats on its planes.
As a result, the airline said it will implement more unpaid leave and job-sharing during the winter, a move that Chief 
Executive Michael O’Leary described as “a better short-term outcome than mass job losses.”
However, he said there will “regrettably be more redundancies at those small number of cabin crew bases where 
we have still not secured agreement on working time and pay cuts, which is the only alternative.”
With the resurgence of the coronavirus in Europe over the past few weeks, many governments have sought to limit 
travel once again after easing restrictions during the summer.
O'Leary said the cutbacks have been “forced upon us by government mismanagement" of European air travel.
“We continue to actively manage our cost base to be prepared for the inevitable rebound and recovery of short-haul 
air travel in Europe once an effective COVID-19 vaccine is developed,” O'Leary said.
Ryanair blames European 'mismanagement' for winter cuts
Over the past few months, airlines including Air France, British Airways and easyJet have cut back their already 
reduced winter schedules as a result of the resurgence of the virus and the travel restrictions.
Ryanair's share price in London fell 4.3% after the announcement. Others airlines saw their stocks fall too, including 
British Airways' parent company, International Airlines Group, which was down 2.8%.
“Spikes in coronavirus cases across Europe are resulting in fresh regional lockdowns, adding to worries that the 
international travel sector will remain depressed for a lot longer than previously feared,” said Susannah Streeter, 
senior investment and markets analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said premarket Thursday that it is reducing its winter flight schedule due to increased flight 
restrictions imposed by European Union countries amid a resurgence of COVID-19 infections.
Air travel to/from much of Central Europe, the UK, Ireland, Austria, Belgium and Portugal have been heavily 
curtailed due to the flight restrictions, causing bookings to decline "slightly" in October and "materially" in November 
and December, according to the company.
The weaker bookings combined with plans to operate with 70% load factors has forced the Irish budget carrier to 
reduce its winter flight capacity to 40% from 60% of the previous year's level. Ryanair said that it now anticipates 
passenger traffic to drop by approximately 38 million guests, although that "could be further revised downwards if 
EU Govts continue to mismanage air travel and impose more lockdowns this winter."
The airline company also said that it was "inevitable" that it will implement more unpaid leave and job sharing this 
winter as well as more redundancies that will affect a small number of cabin crew bases.
"We have continued to flex our capacity in Sept & Oct to reflect both market conditions and changing government 
restrictions, with the objective of sustaining a 70% load factor, which allows us operate as close to breakeven as 
possible and minimise cash burn. While the Covid situation remains fluid and hard to predict, we must now cut our 
full year traffic forecast to 38m guests," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

Ryanair is to cut its planned winter capacity by a third due to a wave of travel restrictions imposed by European 
governments, the airline said on Thursday.
The airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, this winter expects to fly 40% of the capacity it flew last year, down 
from an earlier forecast of 60%, it said in a statement.
It expects to fly 38 million passengers in its financial year to March 31, 2021, it said, down from a forecast of 50 
million made in September and from 149 million flown last year.
That estimate could be lowered further if more lockdowns are introduced and travel restricted, Group Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary said.
"While we deeply regret these winter schedule cuts, they have been forced upon us by government 
mismanagement of EU air travel. Our focus continues to be on maintaining as large a schedule as we can sensibly 
operate," O'Leary said.
The airline's focus is to "keep our aircraft, our pilots and our cabin crew current and employed while minimising job 
losses," he said.
The airline will maintain up to 65% of its winter route network, but with reduced frequencies.
A new wave of travel restrictions in recent weeks has caused forward bookings to weaken slightly in October, but 
materially in November and December.
Ryanair to close Cork and Shannon bases for winter
Bases will be closed in Cork and Shannon in Ireland and Toulouse in France with significant cuts in Belgium, 
Germany, Spain, Portugal and Vienna, the statement said.
The airline plans to implement more unpaid leave and job sharing and there will be some redundancies at cabin 
crew bases where pay cuts have been rejected, the statement said. (Reuters)

       European stocks fell for a third day running on Thursday as surging coronavirus infections across Europe as 
well as tightened restrictions to battle the second wave of infections dampened the prospects for economic 
recovery. 
 Europe now has over 7.2 million confirmed cases of the virus, according to the World Health Organization.
 The European Commission warned today that EU governments were unprepared for the new surge of Covid-19 
infections and urged states to adopt a common strategy for the new phase of the pandemic.
 "While the evolution of the pandemic is getting back to March levels, our state of preparedness is not," the EU 
executive's vice-president Margaritis Schinas said.
 Fading hopes for more U.S. fiscal stimulus before the presidential election, rising U.S.-China tensions and worries 
over Brexit talks also dented investors' appetite for risk. 
 The pan European Stoxx 600 fell 2.3 percent to 362.21 and headed toward its biggest drop in three weeks.  
 The German DAX lost 2.9 percent, France's CAC 40 index shed 2.3 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was down 
2.2 percent. 
 Banks Commerzbank, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole fell 3-5 percent, tracking a decline in bond yields. 
 Italy's Banco BPM rose about 2 percent after it signed a non-disclosure agreement to explore a potential tie-up with 
France's Credit Agricole.
 Swiss drug maker Roche Group declined 2.6 percent after reporting a fall in third-quarter sales. 
European Shares Extend Losses As Virus Cases Surge
 Chemicals and biotechnology company Lonza Group advanced 1.6 percent after it forecast double-digit sales 
growth as part of its 2023 group guidance.
 Medical and safety technology provider Draegerwerk AG . KGaA rose more than 3 percent after its preliminary 
EBIT for the third quarter significantly increased to 127 million euros from last year's 9.3 million euros, reflecting a 
higher net sales volume and a higher gross profit margin.

restrictions across the EU.
 BP Plc fell 4.6 percent and Royal Dutch Shell gave up 4.5 percent as oil prices fell over 2 percent on rising 
concerns about the global economic outlook.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) will cut capacity for its winter schedule between November and March 2021 from 60% to 
40% of the year-ago period and said there will be more redundancies at cabin crew bases amid increased flight 
restrictions in the European Union.
The airline said Thursday it expects to maintain up to 65% of its winter route network, but with reduced frequencies, 
and plans to operate with a 70% load factor.
Ryanair said passenger traffic in full fiscal 2021 is estimated to drop to about 38 million guests, adding that the 
guidance could drop even further if more lockdowns are imposed.
The company also announced significant base aircraft cuts in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Vienna in 
addition to the winter closure of bases in Cork, Shannon, and Toulouse.
Ryanair will implement more unpaid leave and job sharing during winter in bases where it agreed reduced working 
time and pay, and said there will be redundancies at bases where no agreements have been signed.
The company was up marginally on Wednesday's close.

Low-cost airline Ryanair is to reduce its winter flight schedule due to coronavirus travel restrictions and a significant 
drop in bookings.
Ryanair plans to take down its capacity to 40 per cent between November and March compared to last year, the 
carrier announced in a statement on Thursday.
Ryanair had originally planned to reduce its capacity to only 60 per cent, but a further drop in bookings prompted 
the additional cut, the company said.
It added it was expecting to operate at 70-per-cent capacity, compared to 95-per-cent capacity in 2019.
"While the Covid situation remains fluid and hard to predict, we must now cut our full year traffic forecast to 38 
million guests," Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Last year, Ryanair and its subsidiaries carried 149 million passengers.
O'Leary accused EU governments of mismanaging air travel during the coronavirus crisis. He urged them to 
implement the European Union's traffic-light system, which allows for travel between regions with low infection 
rates.

Oct 15, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  LONDON (AP) — Ryanair became 
the latest European airline to announce big reductions in its winter schedule after coronavirus-related travel 
restrictions were reimposed across the continent. Casting the blame on European governments for 'mishandling' air 
travel during the pandemic, the Ireland-based budget airline said Thursday that it will cut around a third of its flight 
routes this winter.  It said demand for flights has been 'heavily curtailed' to and from the U.K., Ireland, Austria, 
Belgium, Portugal and much of central Europe. 
 The airline said it will maintain up to 65% of its route network between November and March and will close its 
bases in the Irish cities of Cork and Shannon, and Toulouse in France through the period. The routes that continue 
operating will see fewer flights.  Overall, the airline said its winter capacity will be 40% of what it was a year earlier, 
compared with the 60% it had previously pencilled in. It also said it expects to fill 70% of seats on its planes. As a 
result, the airline said it will implement more unpaid leave and job-sharing during the winter, a move that Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary described as 'a better short-term outcome than mass job losses.' However, he said 
there will 'regrettably be more redundancies at those small number of cabin crew bases where we have still not 
secured agreement on working time and pay cuts, which is the only alternative.' With the resurgence of the 
coronavirus in Europe over the past few weeks, many governments have sought to limit travel once again after 
easing restrictions during the summer. O'Leary said the cutbacks have been 'forced upon us by government 
mismanagement" of European air travel. 'We continue to actively manage our cost base to be prepared for the 
inevitable rebound and recovery of short-haul air travel in Europe once an effective COVID-19 vaccine is 
developed,' O'Leary said. (Ad) This biotech stock focused on psychedelics is seeking to disrupt the mental health 
market. Over the past few months, airlines including Air France, British Airways and easyJet have cut back their 
already reduced winter schedules as a result of the resurgence of the virus and the travel restrictions. Ryanair's 
share price in London fell 3.4% after the announcement.7 Great Biotech Stocks That Don't Depend on a 
Coronavirus Cure[1]Biotech stocks are some of the most volatile for investors to include in their portfolio. And that 
volatility can be hard to predict. Biotech companies don't have a firm correlation with the overall economy. And what 
can add to the challenge is that many of these companies are small-cap companies that are not well-known names. 
These small biotech stocks may shoot higher based on a vaccine or drug candidate that gets national attention. But 
these small-cap stock also reflect the adage of letting the buyer beware. Because the stark reality for many 
investors is that the vast majority of these treatments never make it past clinical trials. And that means that a stock 
that goes up rapidly can move down just as fast. We're seeing that right now with the multitude of companies that 
are competing in the race towards a vaccine and/or treatment for Covid-19 and the novel coronavirus that causes

the disease. And if you've been good at timing the market, you could have made some good money on some of 
these candidates. Of course, if you held the stock too long, you could have lost your shirt as well. That doesn't 
mean however that buy and hold investors should avoid the biotech sector altogether. There are still some 
attractively priced small-cap biotech companies that are working on treatments for a range of conditions that 
provide them with a large addressable base. And we've identified seven of these stocks in this special presentation.

Oct 14, 2020( Naked Capitalism: http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The WTO issued a ruling 
in its biggest trade dispute ever: the tit for tat between Boeing and Airbus over government subsidies. Boeing 
started its action against Airbus in 2004; Airbus lodged its case against Boeing in 2005. Boeing won a ruling in its 
favor in 2019, permitting the US to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods; as we'll see, the US has 
already started levying charges. The EU win allows Europe to impose tariffs on $3.99 billion of specified US goods, 
including Boeing airplanes, although the EU needs to take an additional formal step to get rolling. The 
extraordinarily attenuated process shows why WTO adjudications aren't a great way to stop trade abuses. 
And this timeline doesn't include appeals, which currently are a non-starter due to the Trump Administration 
refusing to appoint new WTO appellate judges. The disparity between the amount of trade the US can subject to 
tariffs, $7.5 billion, versus the EU's $3.99 billion, means the US is being reported as having an advantage in 
settlement talks ('talks' also assumes a Biden win). But the Wall Street Journal reports, in a pretty big detail that 
other accounts appear to have missed, that the EU can levy more in tariffs based on earlier decisions in its favor[1]: 
European officials say they can levy an additional $4 billion in tariffs based on a previous finding of other U.S. 
violations, which would be on top of the $3.99 billion awarded on Tuesday. Ooops. Even though this $4 billion is 
outside the aircraft tit-for-tat cases, if the US doesn't have other WTO judgments against Europe in its favor (and I 
don't see any indication of that in the stories I've seen), it looks like a slight edge for the EU on a raw numbers 
basis. And the US position is weakened a bit further by the 737-Max diminished state of Boeing, which means that 
aircraft tariffs would hurt Boeing more than similar tariffs applied to Airbus. The EU could impose 15% tariffs on the 
737 Max right when Boeing hopes to deliver planes to buyers like Ryanair in 2021. It would be nice to see a version 
of this chart that showed the nominal sales value of these orders and deliveries, but this gives an idea of the relative 
positions of the two manufacturers. From Defense Security Monitor on September 14[2]:And from the body of the 
story[3]: At the end of August, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,501 jets, of which 6,615, or 88 percent, were A220 
and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 224 aircraft below the company's all-time backlog record of 7,725 
aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of August 2020, Boeing's backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 
adjustment) was 5,160 aircraft, of which 4,164, or 81 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing's all-time 
backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered

On?
represents 8.7 years of shipments at the 2019 production level. In comparison, Boeing's backlog would 'only' last 
6.4 years at the 2018 level, which we use as a proxy for 2019 due to the severe drop in 737 MAX deliveries. This 
year to date, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is negative due to 
cancellations exceeding gross orders. Airbus' book-to-bill ratio is 1.07, thanks mainly to very strong order bookings 
in January. In 2019, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio was negative, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.89. Lambert 
linked yesterday to Leeham News' take on Boeing's 20-year Current Market Outlook: Boeing's latest forecast raises 
more doubt than hope[4]. Even Boeing isn't trying to pretend that conditions will improve soon. Even the 
mainstream press concedes that Boeing has more to lose. From the New York Times[5]: The tariffs, when 
American companies are reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, would be especially painful for Boeing, which is 
already struggling from a pair of devastating crises. Boeing, like Airbus, announced plans this summer to cut more 
than 10 percent of its global work force amid a steep decline in travel, which has forced airlines to delay and scale 
back plans to buy planes. Both Boeing and Airbus plan to cut more than 30,000 jobs in all. To state the obvious, this 
isn't a great time for Boeing and Airbus to be kicking each other in the teeth via tariffs. And even though the WTO 
rulings allow each party to levy charges on goods other than airplanes, they are listed first and presumably 
represent the biggest economic target. And the US has already hit US Airbus buyers with tariffs, which makes it well 
nigh impossible for the EU not to respond in kind, even if the intent is to bring the US to the table.BOEING: The EU 
will immediately re-engage with the U.S. in a positive and constructive manner to decide on next steps. Our strong 
preference is for a negotiated settlement. Otherwise, we will be forced to defend our interests &#38; respond in a 
proportionate way. #EUTrade[6] @wto[7] https://t.co /oQPjPmYm37[8] — Valdis Dombrovskis (@VDombrovskis) 
October 13, 2020[9]The Seattle Times and New York Times reports give the most background on the disputes. 
From the Seattle Times[10]: The WTO authorized the action against the U.S . in response to illegal government 
subsidies for Boeing[11]. The parallel ruling allowed the U.S. to impose $7.5 billion in tariffs on EU goods for illegal 
subsidies to Airbus[12]. In October 2019, 15 years into the case, the U.S. finally slapped tariffs of 25% on a series 
of non-aerospace goods including European wine, whiskey and cheese and a 10% tariff on European-built Airbus 
jets[13]. In March, the U.S. increased the tariff on imports of Airbus planes — though not those assembled in 
Mobile, Alabama — to 15%. Note that the WTO doesn't regard subsidies per se as illegal; governments can 
subsidize production targeting domestic customers to their heart's content. The no-no is subsidies that confer a 
advantage in foreign trade.  The US objected to Airbus having gotten bargain-rate loans that allowed the European 
champion to move up from its below 25% market share in 1990 to being a competitive equal. The EU targeted the 
State of Washington's business and state occupation tax relief for Boeing. Even though the US has tried depicting 
the WTO ruling as invalid because Washington eliminated those WTO-offending gimmies in March, the WTO ruling 
against Boeing is based on the harm of those subsides from 2013 to 2015.  It isn't clear if the two sides can come to 
terms. If Trump unexpectedly wins in November, it's hard to see the Administration backing down, particularly with 
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer sounding as pugnacious and as unconcerned about accuracy as his 
boss. From the Journal: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the top U.S. trade negotiator, said the EU 
has 'no lawful basis to impose tariffs' because the subsidies for Boeing have already been repealed. He suggested 
the U.S. would consider retaliating if Brussels moved forward with tariffs. 'Any imposition of tariffs based on a 
measure that has been eliminated is plainly contrary to WTO principles and will force a U.S. response,' he said. But 
the Journal also reports that the two sides have been trying to de-escalate: Both the U.S. and the EU have taken 
steps in recent months to defuse their dispute, which spawned a series of claims, WTO rulings, concessions and 
appeals that have colored broader trade relations between them and led to tariffs on goods ranging from cheese to 
industrial parts. Boeing earlier this year stepped away from tax breaks provided by Washington state for 787 
production. The company recently said it planned to end assembly of the plane in the state and move it to South 
Carolina. Airbus announced a deal in July with Spain and France to change some financial-support agreements. 
Both sides now maintain they are in full compliance with WTO guidelines. If Biden wins, even though his team 
would presumably prefer to come to an understanding with Europe, most observers expect his Administration to 
move slowly so as not to look soft on trade.  The New York Times, interestingly, depicts the current state of play as 
more contentious than the Journal does[14]: It remains to be seen whether the new tariffs will ultimately persuade 
the United States and Europe to come to a negotiated settlement that would lift the levies, or merely inflame 
relations and result in higher costs on businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. The European 
Union has repeatedly appealed to the United States to remove its tariffs, but American officials say Europe has not 
taken the necessary actions to stop its Airbus subsidies. The tariffs will not go into effect immediately. The 
EU Wins WTO Ruling on Boeing Subsidies, Following WTO Ruling for the US on Airbus Subsidies. Tariff War 
On?
European Union needs to request authorization from the W.T.O. to impose the levies, which it can do at an Oct. 26 
meeting at the earliest. The European Commission last year issued a preliminary list of American products that it 
could choose to tax, including aircraft, chemicals, citrus fruit, frozen fish and ketchup. Regardless, aside from the 
EU possibly seeking WTO authorization sooner rather than later, no one expects anything to happen on this front 
until after the election. And optimists hope that going through a period of higher trade barriers will eventually lead to 
a reset and improved trade relations. But to quote a cynical colleague, 'If you want a happy ending, watch a Disney 
movie.'https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/10/eu-wins-wto-ruling-on-boeing-subsides-following-wto-ruling-for-

UK flag carrier British Airways, reeling like its peers from the pandemic's impact on air travel, has axed a slew of 
flights and cut 10,000 jobs. Yesterday it was the turn of Alex Cruz, the man whose command of the hot seat - as 
BA's chief executive and chairman - made him responsible for the airline's response to coronavirus.
His four-year tenure brought heavy criticism. Stakeholders of all stripes griped. Union discontent forced Mr Cruz to 
abandon controversial plans to "fire and re-hire" thousands of workers. Passengers, never a uniformly happy bunch 
at BA, ratcheted up complaints about deteriorating service. Investors pushed the market worth of parent 
International Airlines Group to under half that of Ryanair.
BA is the biggest revenue contributor to IAG, the listed entity that includes Spain's Iberia and a clutch of other 
airlines. Last year BA made up comfortably more than half of sales at IAG and two-thirds of pre-exceptional 
operating profit.
IAG is not disclosing the financial terms under which the Spaniard will depart or those agreed with his successor, 
Sean Doyle, the boss of Aer Lingus. Mr Cruz, who will retain the role of non-executive chairman for a transition 
period, was paid £805,000 in salary and pension last year and took a 33 per cent Covid-19 pay cut.
One hopes Mr Doyle's terms are more in keeping with our parsimonious times. The company has just tapped 
investors for (EURO)2.75bn to bolster its balance sheet after racking up a record first-half net loss of (EURO)3.8bn. 
The changes at the top show new IAG boss Luis Gallego putting his stamp on the group after taking over from the 
peppery Willie Walsh.
British Airways : Cruz control Twitter : @FTLex
Conventionally, when a boss steps down after operational challenges, the replacement is supposed to take the 
business on to a new phase. That would be optimistic in the case of BA. The airline is losing money hand over fist. 
It cannot expect the unquestioning state bailouts continental flag carriers have been receiving. Even cheap fuel is of 
little benefit when planes are grounded. Air travel could take three to four years to get back to normal, if it ever 
does. Business travellers have warmed to video meetings.
The world is now in retreat from globalisation for epidemiological as well as political reasons. Friends may wonder 
whether to congratulate Mr Doyle or commiserate with him.

UK flag carrier British Airways, reeling like its peers from the pandemic's impact on air travel, has axed a slew of 
flights and cut 10,000 jobs. Yesterday it was the turn of Alex Cruz, the man whose command of the hot seat - as 
BA's chief executive and chairman - made him responsible for the airline's response to coronavirus.
His four-year tenure brought heavy criticism. Stakeholders of all stripes griped. Union discontent forced Mr Cruz to 
abandon controversial plans to "fire and re-hire" thousands of workers. Passengers, never a uniformly happy bunch 
at BA, ratcheted up complaints about deteriorating service. Investors pushed the market worth of parent 
International Airlines Group to under half that of Ryanair.
BA is the biggest revenue contributor to IAG, the listed entity that includes Spain's Iberia and a clutch of other 
airlines. Last year BA made up comfortably more than half of sales at IAG and two-thirds of pre-exceptional 
operating profit.
IAG is not disclosing the financial terms under which the Spaniard will depart or those agreed with his successor, 
Sean Doyle, the boss of Aer Lingus. Mr Cruz, who will retain the role of non-executive chairman for a transition 
period, was paid £805,000 in salary and pension last year and took a 33 per cent Covid-19 pay cut.
One hopes Mr Doyle's terms are more in keeping with our parsimonious times. The company has just tapped 
investors for (EURO)2.75bn to bolster its balance sheet after racking up a record first-half net loss of (EURO)3.8bn. 
The changes at the top show new IAG boss Luis Gallego putting his stamp on the group after taking over from the 
peppery Willie Walsh.

Conventionally, when a boss steps down after operational challenges, the replacement is supposed to take the 
business on to a new phase. That would be optimistic in the case of BA. The airline is losing money hand over fist. 
It cannot expect the unquestioning state bailouts continental flag carriers have been receiving. Even cheap fuel is of 
little benefit when planes are grounded. Air travel could take three to four years to get back to normal, if it ever 
does. Business travellers have warmed to video meetings.
The world is now in retreat from globalisation for epidemiological as well as political reasons. Friends may wonder 
whether to congratulate Mr Doyle or commiserate with him.

Top holding
Cause for concern
The biggest holding in Spectrum is the long-only hedge fund Egerton Capital Equity, which accounts for 11.5% of 
the portfolio, according to Morningstar.
In its August factsheet, Spectrum noted that the £124.1m Aurora Investment Trust , which makes up 2.9% of the 
portfolio, has had ‘a more difficult 2020’ because of the pandemic. At the end of August the trust’s shares were 
trading at £1.65, at a 4.6% discount to the net asset value of £1.73. It returned -15.3% on the three years to the end 
of August.
‘While the UK equity market as a whole has been weak this year, Aurora has also suffered from owning a range of 
businesses that have been materially impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, including Barratt Developments, EasyJet and 
Ryanair,’ Spectrum said.
With international travel restrictions in force, it is easy to see why airlines have been hit. EasyJet’s share price fell 
64.9% from the start of the year until the end of September, and according to Morningstar returned -12.2% to 
Aurora from April to September. 
Ryanair’s share price fell 23.1% between 1 January and 30 September. However, this figure belies Ryanair’s 
recovery since the initial dramatic crash in March, returning 27.7% between April and September, according to 
Morningstar.
Covering the six months to 30 June, housebuilder Barratt Developments recorded a pre-tax profit of £491.8m, down 
46% from £909.8m over the same period in 2019. This was attributed to a lower number of completions and 
increased costs to meet safety requirements because of Covid-19.
Despite this period of poor performance, Spectrum backs Aurora, managed by Phoenix Asset Management, in the 
long term.
Savvy shares and a trailing trust: inside a fund of funds
‘It is too soon to tell when the Covid-19 clouds will clear but, when they do, Aurora should bounce back strongly,’ 
the factsheet said.
Talk to Frank: The Citywire view
Tom Yeowart has enjoyed a strong run on the Trojan Spectrum  fund since taking over management in September 
2014. He has received 28 of 37 possible Citywire ratings, which reflects his general outperformance. He has been 
second quartile or better in each calendar year he has managed the fund.
The fund is aggressively positioned, with nearly three-quarters in developed equity markets. The portfolio has been 
helped by having a small allocation to UK equities, which have suffered post Breixt referendum, instead preferring 
international equities. A long-term holding in the fund is Citywire A-rated Nick Train’s Lindsell Train Global Equity  
fund.
More recently the fund’s defensive allocation to gold bullion has reaped the rewards of the flight to safety during the 
pandemic – a trend that pushed the price of the yellow metal to its all-time high of more than $2,000 (£1,530) an 
ounce.

Highlight: Ireland is planning to introduce airport testing to support the recovery of the aviation sector amid the 
Covid-19 pandemic.
Body
This comes after Ireland-based airlines Ryanair and Aer Lingus criticised the government for imposing a 14-day 
quarantine for passengers arriving in the country, a step which is said to dampen travel demand and impede its 
recovery. Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly told Reuters that plans are currently being worked out to introduce 
airport testing as an alternative to quarantine for some incoming travellers. 
The schemes under consideration include waiving off quarantine requirements for passengers from some 
destinations if they produce negative Covid-19 tests taken three days before travelling. Other passengers may be 
required to undergo a second, rapid test before departing. However, the minister did not specify when the initiative 
will be ready for implementation. As of 12 October, Ireland has reported more than 42,520 Covid-19 cases. The 
death toll has crossed 1,800. Globally, the virus has infected more than 37 million people and killed around 1.07 
million. Recently, the Airports Council International (ACI) World and the International Air Transport Association 
(IATA) called for universal testing of passengers as an alternative to restrictive quarantine measures. The Covid-19 
pandemic has significantly affected the aviation industry. Globally, passenger traffic fell by 58.4% in the first half of 
this year compared to the figures for the same period in 2019. An ACI World report found that the world's busiest 
airports also recorded sharp declines in numbers following the pandemic.

Seven of the world's biggest aerospace companies have warned that the aviation industry's drive to reach net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050 is at risk because of the lack of agreement on how to encourage the use of sustainable 
aviation fuel.
In a letter to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the chief technology officers of Boeing, Airbus, Rolls-
Royce, General Electric, Safran, Dassault Aviation, and Raytheon have urged greater efforts to create "conditions 
under which sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) can be widely deployed".
They warn that without broad agreement on tools and policies to incentivise the use of green fuels, energy 
companies would not put up the "trillions of dollars of capital investment between now and 2050" required to meet 
the needs of the aviation industry.
The industry is divided over how best to encourage the development of sustainable fuels, which are currently three 
to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Norway, for example, has set a minimum requirement for 
green fuel. The EU is also considering a quota for all aircraft refuelling in the bloc.
But some airlines, such as Ryanair, have lobbied hard against quotas, unless they apply to all airlines globally. 
Others believe production should be subsidised by governments until it becomes commercially viable.
Aerospace executives encourage green fuel use
The financial questions are much more important now that the aviation industry is struggling with the biggest crisis 
of its history because of the pandemic. With cash preservation a priority, there is little incentive to buy more green 
fuel.
Moreover, sustainable fuels currently account for less than 1 per cent of jet fuel supply. Warren East, chief 
executive of aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce, has said in the past that volume would have to be increased by a 
factor of 1,000.
"To be compatible with a net zero carbon future, we will still need 500m tonnes of sustainable fuels to power the 
aviation industry of 2050," he said.
The challenge of expanding production has left some climate change experts sceptical about the potential of 
sustainable fuels.

Oct 12, 2020( Customer Service Blog: http://www.hyken.com Delivered by Newstex)  Each week I read a number of 
customer service and customer experience articles from various resources. Here are my top five picks from last 
week. I have added my comment about each article and would like to hear what you think too. Radical Empathy 
And Other Ways To Rethink Your Customer Experience[1] by Bridget Brennan (Forbes) Our world is changing by 
the minute (or so it seems), but amidst all the disruption, one thing remains constant: women's domination of 
consumer spending. 
That fact alone provides a valuable compass for innovating your customer experience during Covid-19, as well as 
reimagining what it could look like post pandemic. My Comment: Let's start this week's Top Five with one of the 
hottest topics in customer service and experience, and that's empathy. The author includes five customer loyalty 
strategies, the first one being empathy. That's what caught my eye. She refers to a deep understanding of your 
customer as radical empathy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of empathy has emerged as an 
important way to communicate with customers, and may very well turn out to be the business 'word of the year.' 
Four proven ways to foster stronger customer loyalty[2] by Liem Viet Ngo (UNSW Business School) Managers and 
marketers who want to boost customer loyalty post-COVID-19 should focus on four key areas, according to UNSW 
Business School research My Comment: In my quest to find the best way to create customer loyalty, here is a great 
article that sets up the importance of going for loyalty followed by four sound strategies. These are very strategic 
and will make you think. Of course, you want to create a great experience (number four), but you also want to build 
'equity' with the brand, relationship and value proposition. Does Ryanair deliver poor service or is it a CX success 
story?[3] by Sampson Lee Ryanair has long been criticized for its poor service and is commonly regarded as 
delivering bad customer experiences. But there's a train of thought that suggests, contrary to this, Ryanair is in fact 
a customer experience success story My Comment: So, we know that Ryanair doesn't win awards for great 
customer service. On the contrary, they are recognized for their poor service. They don't hide it. If you want a 
comfortable first-class seat, this airline is not for you. But, if you want the lowest prices, then you've found cheap-
fare utopia (my term, not theirs). If the value perceived (low fares) is more important than the experience, the value 
will push the experience aside. Ryanair doesn't promise you the best service. They promise you a low price. And for 
them, it works. 13 Ways To Leverage The Trust-Building Power Of Company And Personal Accolades[4] by Expert 
Panel (Forbes Agency Council) You can proclaim your value proposition in emails, ads and owned media, but leads 
will find few things more persuasive than the praise of happy consumers or recognition from industry leaders and 
5 Top Customer Service Articles For the Week of October 12, 2020
peers. Here, 13 members of Forbes Agency Council look at ways of leveraging accolades to maintain customer 
loyalty while winning new business. My Comment: A powerful way to build trust with your company is to have your 
customers evangelize your products and services. Word-of-Mouth marketing, as it is called, is about others 
testifying on your behalf. Friends, colleagues and even strangers who comment and share their opinions can help 
build the trust needed to get a customer to want to do business with you. How do you do it? Here are 13 ways from 
an Expert Panel put together by the Forbes Agency Council. Building customer service resilience during continued 
uncertainty[5] by Paul Selby (A Customer Service Perspective) As living with the pandemic has become a fact of 
life, customers' expectations for great customer service have returned. And with uncertain times still ahead, now is 
the time to bolster the means of delivering customer service in a resilient and flexible manner to meet those 
expectations. My Comment: Paul Selby is an executive at ServiceNow. Somehow he finds time to write articles, it 
seems weekly about the topic of service and experience. This is an interesting take on how resilient your service is 
during an uncertain economy, such as the one that COVID-19 has delivered to us. He shares five ideas worth 
thinking about. Some of this may seem like old news, but today it's more important than ever.BONUS8 Ways to 
Stand Out in Your Next Virtual Meeting[6] by Shaun Belding (The Belding Group) This article shares eight of the 
very basics to remember for your next Zoom (or other virtual meeting) call: My Comment: It's not customer service, 
but it is about creating a better experience for customers and employees - during your next virtual meeting or 
presentation. We've all been seemingly over-exposed to poorly managed online meetings. My thought is that it's not 
the online meeting, but the people presenting at these meetings and events. Read this article, and if you're not 
using these ideas already, I'll guarantee you'll be better at your next virtual meeting. Your customers and colleagues 
will really appreciate you for the effort! Shep Hyken[7]is a customer service expert, professional speaker and New

Alaska Airlines seeking to buy more Boeing 737 MAX?
Alaska Airlines seeking to buy more Boeing 737 MAX?

Boeing is in talks with Alaska Airlines, a major American airline, to sell more 737 MAXs after the aircraft 
recertification.
While more details of negotiations among the manufacturer and the airline are not made public, the exact size of 
the new potential 737 MAX order is not clear yet.
According to Boeing 737 MAX order list, Alaska Airlines aimed to purchase a total of 32 aircraft in 2012. However, 
none of the jets were delivered since that time due to two fatal Boeing 737 MAX aircraft crashes in 2018 and in 
2019, after which the aircraft was grounded.
If negotiations succeeded, a new order of the Boeing 737 MAX by Alaska Airlines would potentially give the 
manufacturer a notable boost in the company's finances. If the agreement on a new order would be reached, it is 
likely that Boeing would grant the airline a significant discount, reported Reuters.
While the authorities worldwide continue working on the 737 MAX recertification process, discussions among other 
airlines should help Boeing to stimulate a future demand for the grounded jet when it is allowed to return to the 
skies. The manufacturer is also in talks with Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, over the compensation for delays in 
MAX deliveries as well as the potential new deal.
Boeing hopes to return the 737 MAX to service and resume the jet deliveries by the end of 2020.

Ryanair warns of Cork, Shannon base seasonal closures

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has warned that it will temporarily close its bases at Cork and Shannon airports for the 
winter 2020/21 season, affecting around 130 employees, if the Irish government does not relax its COVID-19 border 
policy. "Ryanair... notified Transport Minister Eamon Ryan that it had no choice but to close its Cork and Shannon 
bases from 26 October for the Winter season, due to the devastating impact of the Irish Government's 
mismanagement of air travel on and off the Island of Ireland since July 1 last," the low-cost carrier said. Ryanair 
called upon the government to immediately adopt the EU's recommended, although not mandatory, "traffic lights" 
system which would introduce more nuanced distinctions and restrictions for various countries depending on their 
current public health situation. 
Currently, Ireland maintains Europe's strictest regime with arrivals from just four countries - Cyprus, Finland, Latvia, 
and airport-less Liechtenstein - absolved from the mandatory quarantine. "Many EU countries, most notably 
Germany and Italy, have allowed the return of intra-EU air travel without quarantine restrictions, and they have 
delivered significantly lower COVID case rates than Ireland," Chief Executive Eddie Wilson argued. The Irish airline 
admitted that "some quarantine restrictions may be necessary" for regions designated by the European Centre for 
Disease Control (ECDC) as "red zones" but called for the relaxation of rules that govern other countries. Ryanair 
said that it would finalise the decision to temporarily close its Cork and Shannon bases if the government does not 
change its policy during the next review of its border restrictions, scheduled to enter into effect from October 13, 
2020.

POINTSRyanair ordered 135 737 MAX planes from Boeing before it was grounded in 2019 following two fatal 
crashesThe Lion Air and Ethiopia Airlines crashes killed more than 340 crew and passengers in 2018 and 2019, 
respectivelyFAA conducted test flights and has drafted a new safety manual in the U.S. while foreign flight agencies 
conduct their own reviews of the plane Irish airline Ryanair said Friday it expects the Boeing 737 MAX, all of which 
were grounded following two fatal crashes, to return to service within the next month. The company has more than 
100 of theplanes non order and isdue to receive them early next year.'The first of those [orders]we would hope to 
arrive in very early 2021,' Ryanair executive Eddie Wilson[1] said. 'The FAA finished their test flights last week and 
it looks like it's going to go back into service in the U.S. in the next month or so.'Ryanair previously ordered 135 737 
MAX planes before they were grounded in March 2019[2].Boeing's commercial passenger plane was grounded 
after 346 passengers and crew were killed in two crashes. 
The first took place on Oct. 29, 2018, when Indonesia's Lion Air Flight 610 crashed in the Java Sea and killed all 
189 people onboard. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on March 10, 2019, near Bishoftu, Ethiopia and killed all 
157 people onboard.In both cases, it was found a glitch in the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System 
caused the planes to go into nosedives, and the pilots were unable to regain control.Shortly after the second crash, 
all 737 MAX planes were grounded, and federal investigators began looking into the problem. Documents from 
Boeing and the FAA showed test pilots encountered the problem two years before the first crash, but still deemed 
the plane safe and did not add information about the potential glitch to the plane's manual.'I'm outraged,' House 
Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio[3] told NPR in October 2019. 'Somehow they saw fit, even 
though they've had it four months, not to provide us this document, which in my mind is the smoking gun.' The 
plane's programming has since undergone detailed review and was reworked to eliminate the glitch, with the latest 
test flights taking place on Sept. 30. During the review, several other potential problems were identified and 
corrected. A draft of revised training procedures was drawn up, and the FAA said 'interested parties' have until Nov. 
1 to submit comments or questions.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency[4] started its own tests on the 
reworked 737 MAX in September and said it will operate at its own pace. This means even if the FAA says the 
plane is ready for flight in the U.S., the EUAS could say it is not ready to be redeployed in Europe. FAA chief Steve 
Dickson last week piloted a Boeing 737 MAX test flight, moving the grounded plane closer to regulatory approval to 
return to service Photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / POOL [ 1]: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-

? Wall Street rallies on renewed hopes of US relief package ? Bailout talks between Pelosi and Mnuchin help lift 
airline stocks ? Spectre of US sanctions sends Turkish lira to record low Global stocks rose after a drip-feed of 
reports resurrected hopes that another round of US stimulus was still a possibility before November's presidential 
election.
The FTSE All-World index, which climbed 0.7 per cent, was on track for its best weekly performance in more than a 
month after the President Donald Trump said in an interview that talks on a US relief package were making 
progress.
A day earlier after Wall Street had closed, Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff to the House Democratic leader, 
tweeted that Nancy Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, "had a 20-minute phone call ... on a 
standalone airlines bill. The two agreed to talk again".
The news helped lift airline stocks, taking the NYSE Arca Airline index up 2.8 per cent by lunchtime in New York.
Some investors were not, however, banking on an imminent deal. Trevor Greetham, investment strategist at Royal 
London Asset Management, said markets were "starting to look through" the twoparty debate over stimulus, given 
"Joe Biden's widening lead in the polls".
Markets were "increasingly seeing the prospect of Democrats taking control of both houses", added Sean 
Markowicz, investment strategist at Schroders. "That will be good for stimulus."
The day in the markets What you need to know
Wall Street's S&P 500 climbed 0.5 per cent with investors appearing to brush aside jobless claims data that showed 
a downward trend may have stalled.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefit fell to 840,000 last week, slightly less than the 849,000 figure the week 
before, but "far too high [and] still well above the 665k peak - for one week - seen after the crash of 2008", said Ian 
Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Airlines such as Lufthansa and Ryanair were among the best performers in Europe, helping the continent's travel 
and leisure sector close up 1.2 per cent.
Turkey's lira hit a record low of TL7.9449 against the dollar after the US warned it was "deeply concerned" at 
reports that Ankara planned to test a Russian S-400 air defence system.
The spectre of US sanctions weighed on the lira although Washington may hold off taking action, said Piotr Matys, 
FX strategist at Rabobank. "Trump's affinity for President Erdogan is an important factor which has so far prevented 
the worst-case scenario of US punitive measures," he said.
Oil prices tracked stocks higher with global benchmark Brent crude rising 2.9 per cent to $43.21 a barrel. Ray

EasyJet warned yesterday the coronavirus crisis would push it into its first annual loss in its 25-year history as boss 
Johan Lundgren appealed for more state support to help airlines through the difficult winter months.
The European low-cost airline's fullyear losses are expected to swell to more than £800m this year as passenger 
numbers have halved amid the Covid-19 emergency.
It expects to report a pre-tax loss of between £815m and £845m in the year to September 30, slightly worse than 
analysts had forecast.
In a sign of the growing desperation for airlines, Mr Lundgren urged the UK government to offer the industry more 
help as the company planned to slash winter flight schedules because of falling passenger demand.
"The UK government urgently needs to step up with a bespoke package of measures to ensure airlines are able to 
support economic recovery when it comes," the company's chief said.
Mr Lundgren has previously called for the abolition of air passenger duty and airport testing to help tempt 
passengers back into the skies.
The spectre of huge losses prompted easyJet's founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou to renew his long-running attacks on 
the company's management.
EasyJet heads for first ever annual loss; Airlines
The airline's largest shareholder, who lost his attempt to oust four directors including Mr Lundgren this year, wants 
the company to cancel a multibillion contract with Airbus for new planes.
"The easyJet scoundrels must stop squandering shareholders' money," he said.
EasyJet shares climbed 2.2 per cent yesterday as analysts had already factored in losses. The company's shares 
have lost about 60 per cent of their value this year.
The carrier will fly only 25 per cent of last year's capacity in the final three months of this year, down from just under 
40 per cent in its most recent quarter, as passenger demand slumps amid rising coronavirus cases and shifting 
quarantine curbs.
The coronavirus crisis has forced airlines across Europe to cut costs and raise cash to see them through the winter, 
a lean period even in normal times.
IAG, owner of British Airways, tapped shareholders for (EURO)2.75bn in a steeply discounted rights issue to shore 
up its balance sheet, while low-cost carrier Ryanair warned this winter would be a "write-off" and has slashed its 
schedules.
With few signs that the industry-wide crisis will improve until well into next year at the earliest, easyJet said it would 
keep its finances under review and consider further opportunities including the sale and leaseback of more of its 
aircraft. About half of its fleet of 337 aircraft are owned by the company.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) expects Boeing (BA) 737 MAX jet to resume service in the US "in the next month or so," clearing 
the way for delivery of the aircraft early next year, Reuters reported, citing a statement from a senior executive of 
the Irish budget carrier.
Earlier this week, the Federal Aviation Administration released a draft report proposing revisions to the training 
requirements for 737 Max pilots, marking another step toward the regulator's certification of the troubled aircraft.
"The FAA finished their test flights last week and it looks like it's going to go back into service in the U.S. in the next 
month or so," Eddie Wilson, the chief executive of Ryanair's main airlines business, told Ireland's Newstalk radio 
station in an interview on Friday. "EASA, the European agency, are working very closely."

Eurozone Travel companies advanced to their best five-day winning streak since early August on rising hopes for a 
$25bn bailout for US carriers and the launch of a trial for a digital health pass to certify that passengers are free of 
Covid-19 infections.
British Airways owner IAG, Lufthansa and Ryanair recorded some of the strongest gains.
Mediobanca rose after Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of the eyewear maker that grew to become EssilorLuxottica, 
told local media he would back "ambitious" growth plans by Italy's largest investment bank.
The billionaire, who has raised his stake in the banking group above 10 per cent, said he planned to remain its 
largest shareholder.
Belgian lender KBC Group gained after Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation since it was likely to be a 
frontrunner among European banks in the recovery from Covid-19.
Nemetschek rose after Barclays raised the German software developer from "equal weight" to "overweight".
Its new boss had shown signs of addressing key investor concerns surrounding unintegrated brands and the 
strategy to transition from a licence to subscription-pricing model, the analysts said. Harry Dempsey

POINTSEasyJet warned that it expects to incur pre-tax losses of up to 845 million ($1.09 billion) for fiscal 
2020EasyJetexpects to fly at only 25% of its normal capacity well into next year.The company has also cut about 
4,500 jobs British budget airline EasyJet[1] warned that it expects to incur pre-tax losses of up to 845 million ($1.09 
billion) for fiscal 2020 - its first ever annual loss.Analysts had forecast a loss of about 794 million, or $1.03 
billion.The budget carrier also said it expects to fly at only 25% of its normal capacity well into next year."At this 
stage, given the continued level of short-term uncertainty, it would not be appropriate to provide any financial 
guidance for the 2021 financial year,' EasyJet stated.Like virtually all British and European airlines, EasyJet has 
been hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic and related quarantines, which has sapped demand and forced 
aircraft to be grounded and carriers to cut costs by laying off workers.EasyJet said it may need more state support 
to survive - in April, the carrier received a 600 million ($775 million) loan from the British Treasury. The company 
has also cut about 4,500 jobs, raised 608 million ($786 million) from selling aircraft and borrowed another 419 
million ($541 million) from shareholders."Aviation continues to face the most severe threat in its history and the U.K. 
government urgently needs to step up with a package of measures to ensure airlines are able to support economic 
recovery when it comes," said EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren. 
Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent, wrote that EasyJet's problems are widespread in the British aviation 
sector.'Hopes of a rapid recovery after the lockdown were dashed when the [U.K.] government introduced 
quarantine restrictions on arrivals from abroad,' he wrote. 'Over the summer peak, the airline [EasyJet] was still able 
to operate at 38% capacity -- but its expectations for the final three months of the year are clearly very 
limited.'Leggett noted that despite cutting costs by selling and leasing back parts of its fleet, Easyjet is still burning 
through cash and its future remains 'deeply uncertain.''Like pretty much every other carrier right now, it's navigating 
through some very stormy skies,' he added.Indeed, EasyJet's principal rival in the budget carrier space, Irish-based 
Ryanair has said it expects to fly at only about 40% of capacity in October. In late July, Ryanair [2]posted a second-
quarter loss of 185 million euros ($217 million), while passenger traffic plunged by 99% over the year-ago quarter. 
Ryanair further warned that "air travel in Europe is likely to remain depressed for at least the next two or three 
years"While Ryanair initially planned to cut 3,000 job[3]s this year - that figure is expected to be lowered after pilots, 
cabin crew and other employees agreed to accept pay cuts.The U.K.'s largest airline, British Airways, has already 
confirmed that it will cut more than 10,000 jobs.Moreover, an airline union official recently warned that EasyJet was 
'hanging by a thread.' BBC News reported that Martin Entwisle[4], a British pilots' union official, said that EasyJet 
Carnage In UK Aviation Continues As EasyJet Warns Of Unprecedented $1 Billion Loss
was in a "really, really dire situation' after meeting with the airline's chief financial officer, Andrew Findlay.Entwisle, 
himself an EasyJet pilot and union representative, said: "I think the easiest way to put it is that the company is 
hanging by a thread. The situation is dire. If we don't have a good summer next summer and make a considerable 
amount of money, we really are going to be out of a job."Last month, EasyJet CEO Lundgren[5] himself admitted 
that the U.K. aviation industry is running out of time and money, and reiterated his urgent plea for more government 
financial support.'This is the last chance to save the U.K. airline industry and ensure it is as vibrant and competitive 
after COVID as it was before,' he stated. 'I hope the government takes it.'Lundgren pointed out how governments in 
Europe, including France, Italy and Germany, have bailed out their airlines, while the British government has been 
more 
reticent.

Brussels and EU states split on post-Brexit share trading Dual listings

Brussels has pushed back against a move by EU governments intended to forestall possible friction in the trading of 
shares in European companies listed in London, saying the plan would cut across Brexit talks.
The European Commission has resisted plans discussed by EU capitals to legislate now to counter the risk that 
trading in London shares could be heavily curbed at the end of Britain's Brexit transition period on January 1. 
National experts from across the EU last week discussed concerns raised by Ireland that EU rules could create 
hurdles for companies whose shares are traded both in the UK and the EU, potentially blocking European investors 
from trading the stocks in London's deep capital markets.
The problem arises because of an EU rule, known as the "share trading obligation" that limits trading on exchanges 
outside the EU once a particular share is regularly bought and sold on venues inside the 27-nation bloc. There are 
many dual-listed companies, including Ryanair and Tui, the travel company. London is the biggest centre for share 
trading in Europe.
But the commission has argued that the threat of losing access to London should be dealt with by other means for 
now. Diplomats told the FT that Brussels warned governments at two separate EU meetings last week that 
changing legislation to accommodate Brexit disruption was the wrong approach, and that such issues should not be 
broached amid negotiations with the UK.
The issue is one of a number of financial access questions the EU is facing as it deliberates over how to handle 
future relations with the City of London, a global financial centre that will henceforth be outside the single market.
Brussels and EU states split on post-Brexit share trading Dual listings
Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, has publicly questioned whether the City should be allowed to 
retain its "prominent position" in serving EU customers, but there are also pressures within the bloc to minimise 
friction for business.
Brussels has insisted throughout Brexit talks that future financial services ties should be based on regulatory 
permissions, known as "equivalence" rights, that the commission can award to non-EU countries unilaterally.
It has suggested that this approach, coupled with action by the EU financial markets authority, Esma, should be 
enough to largely address the problem for dual-listed shares in the short term. Brussels would then review the 
situation next year.
But diplomats confirmed that, during a video meeting of national officials on September 28, close to 10 
governments including Ireland, Luxembourg and the Baltic states spoke favourably of exploring rapid legislation to 
deal with the problem.
This would be done by inserting a solution into an otherwise unrelated financial markets law that the commission 
proposed this year.
However, Brussels said this draft markets law was intended to spur Europe's recovery from Covid-19, not to 
address Brexit.
The stance has some backing from governments, including France.

Oct 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, United 
Airlines UAL[1] announced its decision to re-start nonstop services to China later this month through flights 
connecting San Francisco and Shanghai. Meanwhile, with the $25-billion federal aid having expired on Sep 30 and 
a second round of stimulus not yet approved despite positive signals to that end, United Airlines laid off around 
13,000 employees.American Airlines AAL[2] also went ahead with its earlier decision to retrench 19,000 employees 
following the expiry of the pandemic package deadline. However, on a positive note, CEOs of both above-
mentioned carriers hinted at the possibility of recalling the departed employees if a second round of fiscal stimulus 
gets approved in the coming days.Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] was in news by virtue of its decision to avail 
of loans up to $1.14 billion from the United States Department of the Treasury. Also, American Airlines opted for 
this facility and is eligible to borrow up to $5.5 billion from the Treasury as mentioned in the previous week's write-
up[4].Notably, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] grabbed headlines by virtue of the update that it is 
currently negotiating with the plane manufacturer Boeing on its current order of up to 210 Boeing 737 MAX planes, 
per a Reuters report[6]. Synopsis of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank 
#4 (Sell), aims to resume nonstop services on the San Francisco-Shanghai route beginning Oct 21, 2020. The 
carrier will utilize the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to serve this route on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and 
Sundays. 
Passengers will be able to return to San Francisco from Shanghai on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and 
Sundays[7].You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[8]2. With demand for 
leisure travel improving,Spirit Airlines SAVE[9]decided to broaden its network by restarting operations to the Haitian 
city of Cap-Haitien. Services on the Cap-Haitien-Fort Lauderdale route are scheduled to be resumed thrice a week 
on Dec 3, 2020.By recommencing non-stop flights to this favorite tourist spot of Haiti, Spirit Airlines aims to take 
advantage of the impending winter holiday season. Additional traffic on the route will boost revenues for the airline, 
which like other carriers is suffering coronavirus-induced revenue weakness. Notably, the flights will connect Cap-
Haitien to 22 major cities in the United States[10]3. American Airlines and United Airlines removed around 32,000 
employees in all following the termination of the Payroll Support Program for the airline industry. However, 
Southwest Airlines' LUV[11] CEO Gary C. Kelly reiterated that there will be no involuntary salary reductions or 
headcount cut through 2020-end. He stated that the carrier is looking at employee pay cuts to avoid furloughs. As 
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL to Resume Shanghai Flights, Job-Cut Updates & More
part of the company's various cost-cutting efforts, the CEO, who is already on a slashed remuneration, will forego 
his entire salary through the end of next year.4. In a bid to bolster its liquidity position in the face of a tepid travel-
demand scenario, JetBlue Airways signed a loan and guarantee agreement with the United States Department of 
the Treasury under the CARES Act. Notably, JetBlue already borrowed $115 million of the eligible amount. The 
carrier now has the option to borrow further through Mar 26, 2021. In connection with the loan contract, this low-
cost carrier inked a warrant deal with the Treasury.5. Due to the coronavirus-induced lackluster performance of 
carriers in the Northern Hemisphere during summer, International Air Transport Association (IATA) issued a 
downbeat current-year airline traffic forecast. Per IATA, global air traffic is expected to plummet 66% in 2020 from 
its 2019-levels. The previous projection had hinted at a 63% year-over-year plunge. Such a dismal prediction 
reflects a weaker-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand[12]. Performance The following table shows the 
price movement of major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows 
that all airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, courtesy of the bullish comments from House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi regarding an additional federal help for the airlines. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has appreciated 4.1% to $57.74. Moreover, during the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has surged 44.6% owing to impressive gains at the likes of Gol Linhas GOL[13], Spirit Airlines and United 
Airlines. What's Next in the Airline Space? Considering that another stimulus package for the airlines may be a 
possibility, as hinted by Pelosi, investors will look forward to the updates on the same. Breakout Biotech Stocks with 
Triple-Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists

Oct 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted disappointing traffic numbers for September, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming 
from the COVID-19 pandemic. This Ireland-based carrier reported a 64% year-over-year plunge in September 
traffic to merely 5.1 million passengers.Ryanair operated approximately 53% of the normal September schedule 
with a load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) of 71%. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair 
(including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 47% to 79.9 million.Apart from the traffic results, Ryanair was in news 
recently when it announced that it will reduce its October capacity by a further 20%[2] due to coronavirus-related 
travel restrictions by European Union governments. In mid-August, the carrier had already announced plans to 
slash its October capacity by 20%[3] due to a drop in bookings following surge in coronavirus cases in some 
European Union countries.With the additional capacity reductions, Ryanair now expects its October capacity to 
decrease from 50% to approximately 40% of October 2019 levels. 
Even at this reduced schedule, the airline anticipates to maintain a load factor (percentage of seats filled with 
passengers) of more than 70% in October. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #4 
(Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation [4]sector are Canadian Pacific Railway Limited 
CP[5], Werner Enterprises, Inc. WERN[6] and Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc KNX[7]. While Canadian 
Pacific and Knight-Swift carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Werner sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[8]Long-term expected earnings per share (three to five 
years) growth rate for Canadian Pacific, Werner and Knight-Swift is pegged at 8.5%, 8.5% and 15%, respectively. 
Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775

Court rules against Ryanair challenge to Irish pandemic travel curbs

Ryanair's claim that Ireland's pandemic-related travel measures are illegal was dismissed by the country's High 
Court on Friday.
Backed by the airline Aer Lingus, Ryanair had argued that the measures were imposed without parliamentary 
approval and were presented by the Irish government as "mandatory."
However the court ruled that the framework was neither mandatory nor an abuse of power.
"The advice to avoid non-essential travel and to restrict movement on entry to the state is just that: advice," said 
Justice Garrett Simons.
According to the Department of the Taoiseach, or prime minister, inbound travellers from countries other than those 
on the government's "Green List" are advised to "restrict their movements for 14 days" by "staying indoors in one 
location."
The list was on Monday cut to just Cyprus, Finland, Latvia and Liechtenstein.
With travel slow to pick up after lockdowns were mostly ended in Europe in June, Ryanair, the continent's biggest 
airline, said on Friday that September traffic dropped by 64 per cent, compared to last year, to 5.1 million guests. 
Only half of scheduled flights were operated.
On Thursday, Ryanair warned of the imminent closure of two Irish bases, including in the second-biggest city Cork, 
if the government did not align its rules with the rest of the European Union by October 13.
"The Irish government needs to open back up," Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson told broadcaster Newstalk ahead 
of Friday's court ruling.

Airline Ryanair has endorsed a Friday judgement by Ireland's High Court that the government's pandemic travel 
measures are advisory rather than mandatory.
Despite losing the case, Ryanair said in a statement it "welcomes" the decision as it "confirms there is no legal 
requirement for the current travel restrictions."
Backed by Aer Lingus, formerly Ireland's state airline, Ryanair sued the government in July over travel guidelines it 
claimed were presented as "mandatory" and were imposed without parliamentary oversight.
Ruling that the guidelines are neither compulsory nor an abuse of power, Justice Garrett Simons said on Friday 
that "advice to avoid non-essential travel and to restrict movement on entry to the state is just that: advice."
According to the Department of the Taoiseach, or prime minister, anyone travelling from countries other than those 
on the government's "green list" are "requested" to "restrict their movements for 14 days" by "staying indoors in one 
location." 
The list of exempted countries is down to effectively three - Cyprus, Finland, Latvia. Liechtenstein, which does not 
have an airport, is also on the list, which was last changed in late September with the removal of Germany, Poland, 
Lithuania and Iceland.
The rules do not apply to Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK and where authorities on Friday announced a 
daily record of 934 cases of the coronavirus.
Ryanair has announced two 20-percent capacity cuts since August and on Friday repeated a warning that it will 
close two Irish bases, including in the second-biggest city Cork, unless the government ditches its list and "adopts 
the EU 'traffic light' system," which would exempt 15 countries from the self-isolation request.
Despite losing, Ryanair welcomes Irish court ruling on pandemic rules
"The Irish government needs to open back up," Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson told Dublin broadcaster Newstalk ahead 
of Friday's court ruling. 
Ryanair previously accused the government of keeping Ireland "locked up like North Korea."
Some of Ireland's domestic restrictions have dragged on for longer than elsewhere in Europe, with all pubs only 
allowed to reopen on September 21, and a ban on attending religious services reintroduced in Dublin after a recent 
rise in daily case numbers.
Official figures show 117 people in hospital after testing positive for the virus, an increase from 10 two months ago.
With travel slow to pick up after lockdowns were mostly ended across Europe in May and June, Ryanair said 
separately on Friday that its September traffic dropped by 64 per cent year-on-year, with only 5.1 million "guests" 
flying last month and only half of scheduled flights taking off.
Data collated by the World Tourism Organization, a United Nations agency, show tourism in Europe to be the 
second-worst hit after the Asia-Pacific by pandemic-related curbs.

Ryanair loses High Court case over Ireland 's COVID-19 travel advice

Body
The High Court ruled on Friday that the government's advice against non-essential travel to most countries due to 
the risk of COVID-19 infection was legal, dismissing a case brought by low-cost airline Ryanair .
Ireland has some of the strictest COVID-19 travel advice in Europe, advising against non-essential travel to all but 
four countries - Cyprus, Finland, Latvia and Liechtenstein. Those four countries however have restrictions on 
incoming passengers from Ireland.
Passengers from all countries - other than those four - coming into Ireland are advised to restrict their movements 
for 14 days.
Ryanair described the Irish government measures as "nonsensical" and questioned their legality in a High Court 
case that rival Aer Lingus also participated in.
"The government acted lawfully in providing travel advice and public health advice in respect of the coronavirus 
pandemic on a non-statutory basis," the ruling by Justice Garrett Simons said.
"The advice to avoid non-essential travel and to restrict movements on entry to the State is just that: advice," the 
ruling said. (Reuters)

Oct 02, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The fact that the ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic has upended air travel is no longer news to us. Even though more than six months have 
elapsed since the health peril was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the dreaded disease 
continues to cripple airline stocks by drastically eating into their passenger revenues.Due to the ill-effects of this 
global health peril, the usually busy summer season for the carriers in the Northern Hemisphere turned out to be a 
damp squib this time. This dismal performance prompted the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to 
downgrade its current-year airline traffic forecast.Per IATA[1], global air traffic is expected to plummet 66% in 2020 
compared with the 2019- levels. The previous projection had hinted at a 63% year-over-year decline. 
The dismal prediction reflects the weaker-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand. The emergence of fresh 
cases in Europe and the re-imposition of restrictions on many European countries are likely to serve as a further 
dampener to the already slow rebound. Notably, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] recently 
announced that it will slash its October capacity by a further 20% due to travel limitations imposed by the European 
Union governments.Given the current scenario, IATA expects air-travel demand to be restored at a much sluggish 
pace than estimated earlier. The airline association predicts that December traffic (measured in revenue passenger 
kilometers or RPKs) is now projected to plunge 68% from the 55% year-over-year fall predicted earlier.Apart from 
the revised traffic forecast, IATA unveiled the global traffic report for August, which was equally disastrous. Per 
IATA, which represents 290 airlines across the globe, RPKs in August slumped 75.3% year over year. Capacity 
(measured in available seat kilometers) was down 63.8% from the August-2019 level. With traffic deteriorating more 
than capacity, load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) contracted 27.2 points to 58.5%. Such a tepid scenario 
can be gauged from the fact that the reading for load factor represented an all-time low for the month.Per Alexandre 
de Juniac, IATA's director general and CEO: 'August's disastrous traffic performance puts a cap on the industry's 
worst-ever summer season'. The sole bright spot was the performance of the carriers in their domestic markets 
(apart from Australia and Japan), which bettered the international market levels with the recovery in demand on the 
international front being 'virtually non-existent' per Juniac.The improvement in the domestic markets is evident from 
the fact that the U.S. carriers including Delta Air Lines DAL[3], United Airlines UAL[4], American Airlines AAL[5], 
Southwest Airlines LUV[6], Alaska Air Group ALK[7] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[8] recorded an uptick in their 
respective August domestic traffic numbers from the July readings. While domestic traffic for the U.S. carriers in 
August declined 69.3% year over year, the July performance was worse with a 71.5% plunge. Wrapping Up Even 
IATA 's 2020 Traffic Forecast Deteriorates Due to Dull Summer
though traffic is likely to be down significantly year over year at least in the remainder of the year as can be figured 
out from IATA's downbeat forecast, the only solace is the improvement in the metric of most domestic flights across 
the globe. Airlines will be hoping that the upturn on their home turf continues on the back of the recently 
implemented safety-protocols to attract passengers. They will also be expecting a vaccine to soon hit the medical 
market for neutralizing the dreaded disease so that people can take to the skies without any apprehension,Come 
what may, we expect investors interested in this not-so-long-ago high-flying space to stay tuned for further updates 
on how things pan out for the airlines in the near term. These Stocks Are Poised to Soar Past the Pandemic The 
COVID-19 outbreak has shifted consumer behavior dramatically, and a handful of high-tech companies have 
stepped up to keep America running. Right now, investors in these companies have a shot at serious profits. For 
example, Zoom jumped 108.5% in less than 4 months while most other stocks were sinking.Our research shows 
that 5 cutting-edge stocks could skyrocket from the exponential increase in demand for 'stay at home' technologies. 
This could be one of the biggest buying opportunities of this decade, especially for those who get in early.See the 5

Ryanair is reportedly looking at a firm order for between 150 and 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
A report in the Irish Independent states that the carrier was seeking to place an order for almost $16 billion of 
aircraft at list prices by the end of the year.
The carrier told Airfinance Journal that: "We don't comment on rumour or speculation."
Ryanair's chief executive officer (CEO) Eddie Wilson was later quoted by Irish broadcaster RTE as saying that the 
carrier was prioritising its current order for 135 firm 737 Max orders and 75 options.
"We're working with Boeing at the moment and our priority is to get that order back into service and we expect that 
to be in early 2021," he was quoted as saying.
The report echoes predictions made by Davy analyst Stephen Furlong that Ryanair was likely to commit to a firm 
Max order by the end of 2020.
Doug Kelly, senior vice president asset valuation at Avitas said the idea of Ryanair placing a large order in the 
current circumstances was "not surprising"
"This has been (Ryanair Group CEO) Michael O'Leary's modus operandi for a long time. Ryanair places large 
orders of airplanes during distressed times to obtain favouable terms.
"Because Ryanair is a low cost airline, they can grow market share while other airlines are pulling back and 
struggling to survive. During really good times, Ryanair finds it difficult to obtain such good terms on aircraft 
purchases," he says.
Olga Razzhivina, senior ISTAT appraiser at Oriel, predicts that the Dublin headquartered carrier would be getting 
an "extremely competitive offer" on any order at this point.
While Kelly said that he did not know what the low-cost carrier pays for a 737 Max he believed the price would be 
lower than anyone else in the market.
Ryanair seeking 150-200 Max order: report
Avitas's current market value (CMV) for a Max as defined by ISTAT is $46.5 million versus a base value of $51.1 
million.  "This value assumes a small lot order of one to five aircraft, not a 150-200 airplane order. I would expect 
the airline to negotiate a discount of at least 20% off our CMV," Kelly states.
While he says that a number of aircraft are not doubt available immediately he does not expect Ryanair to 
necessarily want them now.
"Most of their fleet is still parked or only flying a very reduced schedule. The passenger demand is not there now 
and won't be until there is a vaccine widely available, which may not be until next summer. We don't expect world 
passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels until 2023/24 timeframe," he says.

Air Nostrum is reportedly seeking (EURO)10 million ($11.5 million) of financial support from Valencian authorities 
and also eyeing a national scheme.
El Confidencial reported that Air Nostrum's chief executive officer, Carlos Bertomeu, and Valencian government 
president Ximo Puig were in discussions over financial aid due to the impact of Covid-19 on the Iberia franchise 
partner.
The regional carrier is also examining the possibility of tapping a (EURO)10 billion fund administered by SEPI to 
provide financial support for companies that have been impacted by the pandemic.
In May, Air Nostrum closed negotiations with the Spanish state-owned Instituto de Credito Oficial to receive a 
(EURO)130 million loan to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 crisis.
The loan, which will be guaranteed by Instituto de Credito Oficial, involves a pool of 18 financial institutions, among 
which are the main Spanish banks: Bankia, Bankinter, BBVA, Caixabank and Santander.
At the time Air Nostrum said the funding followed two months of negotiations and would cover the company's cash 
flow needs for the rest of this year.
El Confidencial notes that an attempt by the Valencian government to provide Air Nostrum with (EURO)3 million in 
2018 towards the renewal of its fleet was blocked following a competition complaint from Ryanair.
Air Nostrum did not immediately comment.

Ryanair has strength to be "~last man standing' - CEO

Ryanair has the financial clout to ensure it would be the "last man standing" in a worst-case scenario resulting from 
the Covid-19 pandemic, chief executive officer Eddie Wilson believes.
Speaking on the carrier's official podcast, Wilson predicted that the Irish carrier's cash reserves, lower cost base 
and ability to ramp up operations put it in a good position to survive an "apocalyptic scenario".
"What we have got going for us is that we have a strong balance sheet and while we did have to raise money 
recently through an equity raising and also through a bond we have one of the strongest, if not the strongest, 
balance sheets," Wilson said.
Because Ryanair owns more than 70% of its fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, although it does incur maintenance costs 
while the aircraft are grounded, it does not have to pay "expensive leases", he said.
He contrasted this with long-haul operators that are paying lease rates of between (EURO)1 million ($1.7 million) to 
(EURO)1.5 million per month for their aircraft.
Because the Irish carrier is operating a flexed working arrangement for staff over the winter, Wilson said Ryanair 
was working on the basis of bringing them back in the summer, rather going for a "redundancy we don't need you" 
approach.
"If you've got the money, you've got the aircraft, you've got the people , you've got the cost base at the airports, 
then you are in a much better position than those that are scrambling around, that are running out of cash, have to 
raise money, looking for short-term deals all the time, selling their aircraft, firing their people," he said.
Wilson said that Ryanair is well placed to come back in a stronger position once the pandemic comes to an end, as 
it did in previous crises such as the global financial crash and the 9/11 attacks.
But he warned that governments in the UK and Ireland had to do more to protect the aviation infrastructure in their 
countries, noting that airlines based in Germany, the Netherlands and France had received significant financial 
support from their respective governments.

Travel demand at Jordan's Amman Queen Alia Airport has remained low since it reopened to international 
commercial traffic earlier this month, says the Airport International Group (AIG). AIG, a consortium of local and 
international partners that manages the airport on behalf of the Kingdom, said in a statement that passenger

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has announced it will open its fourth French base, at Paris Beauvais, on December 3, 
2020, stationing two B737-800s out of the airport. The Irish LCC plans to launch two new routes from the Parisian 
airfield following the opening of the base - to Paphos and Manchester Int'l - on top of the 30 already operated albeit 
with aircraft based at other airports. Ryanair was the first airline to launch scheduled flights out of Beauvais in 1997. 
It will be the first airline to establish a crew base at the airport, an LCC-oriented airport located around 100 
kilometres north of downtown Paris. Despite not having a base at the airport, the Irish LCC is already Beauvais's 
largest operator with 12,654 weekly seats and a 51.3% market share by capacity, the ch-aviation capacities module 
shows. The second-largest airline at the airport is Wizz Air with a 35.2% market share by capacity. The Beauvais 
base will be Ryanair's first new base since the COVID-19 pandemic started.

Sep 27, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  With the 
coronavirus crisis putting a chill on travel, European airlines are reducing fares to attract passengers and fill the 
planes that are still flying.Travel restrictions adopted by many countries to stem the spread of the disease have 
clobbered airlines, bringing air traffic to a near halt in the spring. And while traffic picked up during the summer, it is 
now falling off again.According to Eurocontrol, which coordinates air traffic in Europe, traffic has been slowing over 
the past couple of weeks, and is now 54 percent below its comparable level last year. A European airline trade 
association says August traffic was just 30 percent of 2019 levels Photo: AFP / Adrian DENNIS A European airline 
trade association has put August traffic even lower, at just 30 percent of 2019 levels.Eurocontrol is now more 
pessimistic about a recovery for the sector.In the spring it had expected traffic to be 30 percent below 2019 levels in 
October, but it now sees a 57-percent drop.While the pandemic has left airlines starved for cash, they have begun 
to cut fare prices. 
While air passerger traffic did pick up a bit during the summer, it is now falling back Photo: AFP / ANGELOS

from Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands to destinations in southern Europe by 15 percent in August 
compared with the same period last year.In a study released Thursday it found that prices on some routes were 
down by more than one third. Airlines have been pushing Europe to take coordinated steps on restrictions and 
testing requirements Photo: AFP / Tobias SCHWARZ "You have to entice travellers to return to flying and price is a 
factor," said Reginald Otten, deputy managing director for France at budget airline easyJet.He said the airline had 
managed to reopen some routes during the summer and the planes it flew were nearly full."But we are nevertheless 
around 30 percent of capacity, which is a very, very low figure, and the summer is the most important, most popular 
(time) for people to travel," he told AFP.Lower prices also stimulate traffic, according to Eddie Wilson, head of 
Ryanair DAC, one of the two firms which operate flights under the Ryanair brand.Ryanair, which has used a low-
cost model to become one of Europe's biggest airlines, this week launched a brief buy-one-get-one-free 
promotion."At some stage you can't sit there and look out of the window and hope that things will be alright and wait 
for the politicians to do something," he said.Beyond cutting prices, airlines can and are focusing on their most 
profitable routes.But the reimposition of travel restrictions and tighter quarantine and testing measures could quickly 
undo their planning and efforts.European airlines earlier this month urged national capitals to coordinate measures 
to limit the spread of the virus, saying the current patchwork of restrictions is hobbling a return to regular travel

The tale this week for UK investors will feel wearily familiar. Again Covid-19 cases are rising. Again the risk of a 
nationwide lockdown is looming. Again the economy looks like it might be dealt another body blow.
The question for investors now is whether recent history continues to repeat. As the pandemic started to spread 
early in the year, the market saw a 35 per cent drop from its peak in mid-January before joining a global rally driven 
by the huge intervention by central banks.
For now, investors still seem to be taking a rather gloomy view of UK company prospects with the FTSE 100 falling 
nearly 3 per cent over the week.
Even before this fall, the FTSE 100's year-to-date loss of 20 per cent meant it was lagging behind its US and 
European counterparts by more than 10 percentage points.
Profit forecasts might be akin to "finger in the air" estimates given the macro uncertainties but Nobel Prize winning 
economist Robert Schiller's longer term measure of comparing today's prices with the average earnings of the past 
decade now shows the UK market to be trading on a ratio of just 12.6 times, down from 15.8 times at the end of 
2019.
The initial reaction this week may be more muted than the sell-off in March but it still indicated a downbeat 
assessment of the prospects for a market exposed to cyclical industries such as finance, commodities and travel.
Investors on the alert as Covid worries loom
Chancellor Rishi Sunak's fresh $5bn for the economy might provide some support but the pain is still coming. As 
Deutsche Bank's Sanjay Raja pointed out in a note on Thursday: "We don't think the Chancellor's plan will be 
enough to fully avert a jobs crisis in the near term."
Financials, as the second-largest sector in the market, will be of particular concern if that's the case.
Although Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey played down the likelihood of negative interest rates this week, 
the prospect of a dwindling number of borrowers will be of little comfort to investors who have watched banks 
struggle to eke out a profit after a decade of near-zero rates.
The outlook for even mid-single digit returns on equity is dim.
Sell-offs also bring opportunities for those seeing through the gloom over a longer term. Morgan Stanley believes 
there might be some in travel, a sector hit by dashed hopes of swift return to holidaying.
Already out-of-favour plays such as easyJet, Tui and Wizz Air were all down more than 15 per cent this week. 
Morgan Stanley did plump for Ryanair this week as one cyclical pick.
The reasons will be familiar to followers of Michael O'Leary's fee extracting airline - lowest unit costs, a lack of 
competition on some routes and ample liquidity from a recent bout of capital raises should mean Ryanair is well 
placed to capitalise when we do take to the skies again.
Little is mentioned, however, of the potential for lingering caution over air travel after a stressful summer of 
quarantines.
News on Thursday of the company offering a buy one get one free offer doesn't bode well for its margins either.
Just as airlines have fared poorly on news of further lockdown measures so the stay-at-home stocks, such as 
Ocado, Just Eat Takeaway and stock gambling stock Plus 500, have excelled.
Grocery delivery specialist Ocado has done particularly well with its stock up 10 per cent following news of a 
bumper third quarter last week, taking its yearto-date return to 124 per cent.
One less obvious stay-at-home play is gin enabler Fevertree which, despite falling this week, is up 11 per cent year 
to date. It seems like an aeon ago that the company swept into town after Schweppes ignored premium gin's rise 
among the melancholic middle classes.
In the UK, Fevertree's years of revenues doubling are firmly in the past, according to Morgan Stanley. But great 
expectations for a further run in sales of mother's ruin lie across the pond.
However, it is facing fierce competition there and for a company trading at 46 times 2021's earnings, there's 
probably pain ahead if there's even a suggestion its US business is losing its fizz.
More broadly, investors might need a stiff drink. The market might rally as investors look through the gloom to a 
world after a Covid-19 vaccine but a winter of rising unemployment and restrictions to tackle the virus will test 
longer-term resolve to stay the course. And that is before one big uncertainty - the countdown to Brexit. If there is 
no deal on this, all bets are off.

Low-cost airlines investigated in Italy for Covid-19 cancellations
Low-cost airlines investigated in Italy for Covid-19 cancellations
dpa international (Englischer Dienst)

Four low-cost airlines, including Ryanair, are facing an antitrust probe in Italy for failing to reimburse flights 
cancelled on account of the coronavirus pandemic.
The carriers offered vouchers rather than full refunds, in a "possible breach" of EU regulations on air passengers' 
rights, the Italian competition authority (AGCM) said in a statement on Friday.
Vueling, easyJet and Blue Panorama are the three other airlines targeted by AGCM's investigation.
The authority noted that even though the pandemic was given as the reason for cancellations, the flights in question 
were scheduled for after the end of Italy's lockdown period.
The airlines were also accused of failing to inform customers about their cancellation rights, and providing "onerous 
and poor" customer service via an expensive and "hard-to-reach" phone helpline.
ACGM said it launched similar investigations in July against two other airlines, Alitalia and Volotea.

UK COVID-19 policy threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs warns Michael O'Leary
UK COVID-19 policy threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs warns Michael

Britain risks losing hundreds of thousands of travel and tourism jobs in the coming months unless the government 
offers proper supports to workers and relaxes travel restrictions, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said on Thursday.
O'Leary, group chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier, was speaking hours ahead of the 
announcement of new UK COVID-19 support measures and weeks ahead of the launch of a European Union plan 
to coordinate travel restrictions in Europe.
Failure join the EU plan and provide a proper furlough scheme to pay those whose work has dried up due to 
COVID-19 "will mean literally hundreds of thousands of job losses this winter," O'Leary told Sky News in an 
interview.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday was due to announce a replacement for the Coronavirus Job 
Retention Scheme, which supported 8.9 million private-sector jobs at its peak in May, as part of a series of new 
COVID-19 support measures.
O'Leary said if there was no "proper" replacement, staff not required would be put on unpaid leave. Job losses 
cannot be ruled out, but Ryanair is "desperately working with our people to prevent them," he said.
O'Leary also called for the scrapping of the United Kingdom's air passenger tax for 12-24 months.
The EU travel scheme, due to be finalized in mid-October, would set out common COVID-19 travel rules across the 
continent and impose restrictions on regions with high COVID-19 rates rather than countries.
UK COVID-19 policy threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs warns Michael O'Leary
O'Leary, who earlier this month described the winter as a "write-off," said Ryanair's forward bookings for November 
and December are around 10%, around a quarter of the normal level for this time of year.
He said British airlines in general were likely to fly around 30-40% of their normal capacity this winter and said 
bookings were now around 20-30% of normal levels. (Reuters)

Worst-hit by pandemic travel curbs, Asia sees domestic tourism grow
Worst-hit by pandemic travel curbs, Asia sees domestic tourism grow

International travel has plummeted during the pandemic, with nowhere worse affected than the Asia-Pacific region, 
according to United Nations tourism body data.
International arrivals across the Asia-Pacific have dropped 72 per cent so far in 2020, according to the data, which 
was compiled for the Madrid-based World Tourism Organization's (UNWTO) new Tourism Recovery Tracker.
The region's June arrivals were down 99 per cent year-on-year, a standstill that came after countries imposed strict 
lockdowns and holiday bans aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
China, Japan and South Korea were among the worst affected, with the UNWTO tracker showing an 83-per-cent 
drop in tourist arrivals across north-east Asia as most countries prohibited all but essential travel.
South-east Asia, where countries remain largely closed to foreign tourists - and some, such as Malaysia, have 
effectively barred citizens from leaving - saw arrivals fall by 64 per cent. 
Around 7 per cent of Malaysia's 2019 gross domestic product (GDP) was derived from international tourism. In 
neighbouring Thailand, that figure usually tops 10 per cent, whereas Cambodia's is nearer to 20.
Asian governments are now promoting internal travel in an attempt to shore up the sector, with Singapore earlier 
this month offering 100-dollar domestic tourism vouchers to residents.
Tony Fernandes, chief executive of Air Asia, one Asia's biggest low-cost airlines, said on Thursday that "our 
domestic routes like in Thailand and Malaysia, we are at about 70 per cent load capacity."
"Business travel, intercontinental travel, first-class travel is going to take longer to rebound," Fernandes said during 
a press conference in Kuala Lumpur.
Worst-hit by pandemic travel curbs, Asia sees domestic tourism grow
After the Asia-Pacific, Europe was the second worst-hit region, UNWTO data show. A 66-per-cent overall decline in 
arrivals was registered - though a revival began after restrictions were eased around the continent in June.
No region has seen tourism fall by less than half, the UNWTO tracker shows, with South America registering the 
least-worst performance to date with a 56 per cent decline.
The UNWTO last month slammed governments for their "timid" efforts to revive tourism, citing worldwide losses 
estimated at 460 billion dollars - equivalent to Austria's GDP - for the first half of 2020.
Airlines have echoed UNWTO's criticism, with Ryanair, Europe's biggest carrier, last week saying pandemic-related 
travel rules had forced it to cut capacity by 20 per cent for the second time in two months.

The Irish LCC is already the largest operator at the airport by capacity and plans to further increase its footprint 
during the upcoming winter season.
Ryanair is opening a base at Paris Beauvais (BVA) before the end of the year, the first new outpost to be 
announced by the carrier since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Two Boeing 737 aircraft will be stationed at the airport from Dec. 3, enabling the launch of two new routes in 
addition to the existing 30 destinations offered.
The airline is already the largest operator at BVA-located about 75 km north of France's capital city-having provided 
more than 1.7 million departure seats from the airport in 2019. This figure represented an increase of 2.3% on the 
previous 12 months.
Ryanair director of commercial Jason McGuinness said the decision to station two aircraft at BVA represents a 
long-term investment, adding the airport offers "the means for traffic growth and new routes." It will become 
Ryanair's fourth base in France alongside Bordeaux (BOD), Marseille (MRS) and Toulouse (TLS).
The new routes being launched will connect BVA with Manchester (MAN) and Paphos (PFO) in Cyprus. Both will 
operate 2X-weekly. Existing destinations served by Ryanair from BVA include Barcelona (BCN), Budapest (BUD), 
Dublin (DUB) and Vienna (VIE).
"Our historic relationship has been strengthened and is now evolving to a new dimension with this operational base, 
its jobs and the potential developments it will allow, especially in such challenging times for air transport," BVA 
chairman François Rubichon said.
The planned launch of the new base comes despite Ryanair's decision to trim capacity over the coming months, 
blaming "continuous changes" in EU government travel restrictions for denting bookings.
Ryanair will cut October capacity by 20%, on top of a 20% reduction already announced in mid-August. The airline 
now expects next month's capacity to fall from around 50% of its October 2019 levels to 40%. However, the ULCC 
said it should maintain a load factor of at least 70% at this reduced schedule.
Ryanair plots Paris Beauvais expansion
"We are disappointed to reduce our Oct capacity from 50% of 2019 to 40%. However, as customer confidence is 
damaged by government mismanagement of COVID travel policies, many Ryanair customers are unable to travel 
for business or urgent family reasons without being subjected to defective 14-day quarantines," a spokesperson 
said on Sept. 18.

The Irish LCC is already the largest operator at the airport by capacity and plans to further increase its footprint 
during the upcoming winter season.
Ryanair is opening a base at Paris Beauvais (BVA) before the end of the year, the first new outpost to be 
announced by the carrier since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Two Boeing 737 aircraft will be stationed at the airport from Dec. 3, enabling the launch of two new routes in 
addition to the existing 30 destinations offered.
The airline is already the largest operator at BVA-located about 75 km north of France's capital city-having provided 
more than 1.7 million departure seats from the airport in 2019. This figure represented an increase of 2.3% on the 
previous 12 months.
Ryanair director of commercial Jason McGuinness said the decision to station two aircraft at BVA represents a 
long-term investment, adding the airport offers "the means for traffic growth and new routes." It will become 
Ryanair's fourth base in France alongside Bordeaux (BOD), Marseille (MRS) and Toulouse (TLS).
The new routes being launched will connect BVA with Manchester (MAN) and Paphos (PFO) in Cyprus. Both will 
operate 2X-weekly. Existing destinations served by Ryanair from BVA include Barcelona (BCN), Budapest (BUD), 
Dublin (DUB) and Vienna (VIE).

UN data shows Asia-Pacific tourism worst-hit by pandemic travel curbs
UN data shows Asia-Pacific tourism worst-hit by pandemic travel curbs

Dateline: Dublin (dpa) -

International travel has plummeted during the pandemic, with nowhere worse affected than the Asia-Pacific region, 
data released by the United Nations tourism body showed on Thursday.
International tourist arrivals across the region dropped 72 per cent in 2020, according to data compiled by the World 
Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the worst decline seen around the world.
In the month of June, international tourist arrivals to the region plummeted 99 per cent year-on-year in the wake of 
pandemic era travel bans, UNWTO's new Tourism Recovery Tracker shows.
China, Japan and South Korea were worst hit by the drop in global travel, with North-East Asia seeing an 83 per 
cent drop in tourist arrivals as most countries prohibited all but essential travel.
South-East Asia, where countries remain largely closed to foreign tourists -  and some, such as Malaysia, have 
effectively barred citizens from leaving - saw arrivals fall by 64 per cent. 
Around 7 per cent of Malaysia's 2019 gross domestic product (GDP) was derived from international tourism. In 
neighbouring Thailand, that figure usually tops 10 per cent, whereas Cambodia's is nearer to 20.
Europe ranks as the second-worst hit region on the UNWTO tracker, registering a 66-per-cent decline in arrivals 
despite an uptick after many restrictions were eased in June.
The UNWTO last month slammed governments for "timid" efforts to revive tourism despite worldwide losses 
estimated at 460 billion dollars - equivalent to Austria's GDP - in the period to June alone.
Airlines have echoed UNWTO criticisms, with Ryanair, Europe's biggest carrier, last week saying pandemic-related 
travel rules had forced it to cut capacity by 20 per cent for the second time in two months.

Ryanair Pilots, Cabin Crew May Go on Unpaid Leave Without 'Proper' 
Furlough Scheme in UK

 Ryanair (RYAAY) pilots and cabin crew may have to go on unpaid leave "for the winter" if the UK government 
doesn't provide a "proper" furlough scheme, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Thursday, according to media 
reports.
In an interview on Sky News, O'Leary said given the "terrible" winter and forward bookings, the airline will need 
"huge" government assistance. In addition, he cited other actions that the UK government may take to help the 
industry, which include the withdrawal of the taxation on air travel to and from the UK and a relaxed travel plan that 
allows advance bookings.
"It seems to me that the British airlines are going to be flying at about 40% or 30% of their normal winter capacity," 
said O'Leary.
Shares fell 0.9% in pre-market trading on Thursday.

Ryanair will put unneeded British staff on unpaid leave if the UK government does not provide a "proper" furlough 
scheme, Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Thursday, as Britain prepares to change its COVID-19 job 
supports.
"We want to keep our pilots and cabin crew employed and paid and we are going to have to have huge government 
assistance for that, otherwise I'm afraid they're all going to go on unpaid leave for the winter," O'Leary told Sky 
News television. (Reuters)

Sep 23, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  It is a well-documented 
fact that stocks in the airline space could not set the stage on fire in 2019 due to headwinds like lackluster cargo 
business and loss of revenues following flight cancellations stemming from the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets. 
These drawbacks continued to weigh on the airlines as they entered 2020. Despite such downsides, passenger 
revenues remained strong owing to impressive demand for air travel.However, with the advent of coronavirus, air-
travel demand nose-dived, crippling passenger revenues in turn. Situation Continues to be Grim as Pandemic 
Persists Airlines are gasping for breath even six months after the dreaded disease was declared a pandemic by the 
World Health Organization on Mar 11. This can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Airline [1]industry has shed 
24.7% of its value since March.Due to depressed passenger revenues, companies like Delta Air Lines DAL[2], 
United Airlines UAL[3] and American Airlines AAL[4] incurred loss in each of the first two quarters of 2020. In fact, 
the coronavirus impact was more severe on the second quarter than on the March quarter as the entire three-month 
period (April to June) bore the brunt of this meltdown in air-travel demand as opposed to only a single month 
(March) in the first quarter of the year.Moreover, the emergence of fresh cases in Europe and the reimposition of 
restrictions on many European countries has sparked further trouble for the aviation stocks. 
For example, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5], currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), announced that it will slash 
its October capacity by a further 20% due to travel limitations imposed by the European Union governments.You 
can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. Q3 Results Unlikely to be Any 
Better As mentioned above, airlines are far from being out of the woods as passenger revenues are way below the 
year-ago levels. Consequently, akin to the first two quarters, the September-quarter results are likely to be bleak as 
well. In fact, many airlines have come out with tepid third-quarter forecasts as they trim capacity in response to the 
dwindling demand scenario.Evidently, Southwest Airlines LUV[7] expects its third-quarter capacity to decline 30-
35% year over year. JetBlue Airways JBLU[8] expects scheduled capacity to decline approximately 55% year over 
year in the September quarter. Delta and United Airlines expect a 60% and 70% drop in their respective capacities 
for the September quarter. Hawaiian Holdings HA[9] expects third-quarter capacity to slump 87% year over year. 
The massive capacity cuts are likely to flare up unit costs in the third quarter of the year. What's Ahead? Despite 
lagging the year-ago readings, airlines are seeing some improvements particularly in terms of leisure-travel 
demand. Owing to these upsides, some airlines issued bullish cash burn-related updates. Evidently, Southwest 
Airlines management stated that air-travel demand rebounded in August after stalling in July and this uptrend has 
Coronavirus Continues to Hurt Airlines : Any Respite Soon?
continued so far in September. As a result of this recovery, the carrier came out with an upbeat third-quarter view 
for cash burn. The metric is now expected to be approximately $17 million compared with almost $20 million 
expected previously.Moreover, with the current stimulus package set to expire at this month-end, many airlines 
warned of potential layoffs October onward as they are faced with the problem of overstaffing in the face of waning 
demand. Notably, airline companies, which accepted the financial assistance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act in April, are prohibited from retrenching employees through Sep 30.The entire 
scenario of job cuts can, however, be avoided if another round of federal help comes through. Many airline 
companies are lobbying for another $25-billion worth federal aid to protect jobs through March 2021. However, 
nothing has materialized yet. As a result, we expect investors to keep track of the updates on the anticipated 
second-round of federal financial grant for the airlines. 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand-picked by a Zacks 
expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique 
qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall 
Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.Today, See These 5 Potential Home

Second wave changes the calculus for Rolls-Royce's cash call
Second wave changes the calculus for Rolls-Royce's cash call

Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today is good advice for procrastinators and those in a pickle. Rolls-
Royce is undoubtedly in a pickle. And it has arguably been putting off an inevitable equity raise for months. But the 
situation facing the aerospace engineering group, which confirmed yesterday that it was evaluating a cash call of up 
to £2.5bn, is nuanced and not as straightforward as its weakened share price implies.
It was always a question of when, not if, with Rolls' equity issue. Its shares have fallen steadily from 680p at the 
start of the year to 160p by yesterday. The strain on its balance sheet was plain well before August's half-year 
results. Revenues based on number of hours its engines fly plummeted when fleets were grounded, while cash 
burn and net debt soared. Difficulties forecasting the industry's future could be cause for delay, but that didn't stop 
easyJet, Ryanair and IAG tapping investors for cash injections before the summer was out.
Rolls pulled out other stops to shore up its liquidity, though, securing access to £4.2bn in new debt between April 
and August and starting a painful restructuring process to save cash. It is also targeting £2bn in proceeds from 
asset sales, with Spanish parts maker ITP Aero slated for disposal.
If the base case for recovery it laid out last month comes to pass, Rolls says it shouldn't need the extra equity. That 
is debatable. It will be a slow return to its investment-grade credit rating without one. But if Rolls can afford to wait 
and circumstances do improve, it could avoid an unnecessarily large and dilutive equity issue. Analysts talked about 
a £2bn raise, not £2.5bn, before August's results.
Second wave changes the calculus for Rolls-Royce's cash call
Rolls' base case depends on avoiding a second series of lockdowns and a rebound in earnest from the fourth 
quarter, however. Recent data are not encouraging. The "severe but plausible downside scenario" Rolls presented 
last month, under which it would need to find more money within the next 18 months, seems ever more likely. If the 
worst does come to pass, refinancing will become much more difficult with delay.
Doing an equity raise now is a hedge against Rolls' worst-case scenario becoming its base case. If there is a 
drastic improvement in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks, Rolls can always change course. But given current 
conditions, it can ill-afford to put off preparing.

Sep 22, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Southwest Airlines LUV[1] dominated headlines by virtue of its positive update on cash burn for the September 
quarter. The bullish forecast on this key metric was primarily owing to improved air-travel demand on the leisure 
front. Moreover, booking trends have also been encouraging.Meanwhile, with no confirmation available yet on 
another round of federal stimulus for the airlines, job cuts are looming large on the industry post Sep 30 (when the 
current package expires). However, the aviation industry is looking to limit job losses in absence of no further aid. 
Updates in this respect were available from Delta Air Lines DAL[2] and United Airlines UAL[3] in the past 
week.European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] was also in the news, courtesy of its decision to trim its October 
capacity due to coronavirus-led travel restrictions. 
Notably, U.S. carriers like Hawaiian Holdings HA[5] provided a tepid capacity outlook for the September quarter as 
mentioned in the previous week's write-up[6]. Synopsis of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Southwest Airlines 
management stated that air-travel demand rebounded in August after shrinking in July and this uptrend has 
continued so far in September. As a result of this improvement, the carrier came out with an upbeat third-quarter 
view for cash burn. The metric is now expected to be approximately $17 million compared with approximately $20 
million expected previously. To preserve liquidity, the carrier raised $18.7 billion through various means since the 
beginning of 2020. As of Sep 15, 2020, the company had cash and short-term investments worth $14.8 billion. It 
also has unencumbered assets of approximately $12 billion[7].2. According to a Reuters report[8], Delta will be able 
to avoid involuntary furloughs of its frontline employees except its pilots on Oct 1, courtesy of a large number of 
employees opting for voluntary separation programs. In a memo to employees, CEO Ed Bastian stated that the 
company will continue to reduce work hours and executive pays through the end of this year.3. Per a Reuters 
report[9], leaders of United Airlines pilots' union (Air Line Pilots Association) voted in favor of approving a tentative 
deal. Terms of the deal though are kept undisclosed. Notably, the Air Line Pilots Association represents roughly 
13,000 pilots of this Chicago-based carrier. By backing this deal, the union inched closer to protecting jobs of nearly 
2,850 pilots at United Airlines until June 2021. Following the support of union leaders, the provisional deal will be 
put to a full vote by the union members from Sep 21.4. Ryanair announced that it will slash its October capacity by 
a further 20% due to travel limitations imposed by European Union governments in the wake of coronavirus. 
Management stated that these travel constraints, often introduced on short notices, were affecting forward

bookings. With additional capacity contractions, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) low-cost carrier now expects its 
October 2020 capacity to decrease from 50% to approximately 40% of October 2019 levels. Even at this reduced 
schedule, the airline anticipates to maintain a load factor of more than 70% next month[10].You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[11]5. Per a CNBC report[12], American Airlines 
AAL[13] is planning to begin training pilots on the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in November. This is a sign that the 
grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft's return to service is approaching. Notably, the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft has 
remained grounded since March 2019 following two crashes which killed multiple passengers. Ever since, this 
aircraft has been under scrutiny and underwent software and other changes. Last month, the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) issued the list of safety-related changes required for the jets to start flying again. Although, the 
FAA is going through the final steps before recertifying the aircraft for services, it is yet to set a specific time line for 
the same. Performance The following table shows the price performance of major airline players over the past week 
and during the past six months.The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week 
leading the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to dip nearly 2% to $61.91. However, during the course of the past six 
months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 60.5% owing to impressive gains at the likes of Gol Linhas 
GOL[14], Spirit Airlines and Copa Holdings. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keep track of the 
updates on the proposed second round of federal financial grant for the airlines These Stocks Are Poised to Soar 
Past the Pandemic The COVID-19 outbreak has shifted consumer behavior dramatically, and a handful of high-tech 
companies have stepped up to keep America running. Right now, investors in these companies have a shot at 
serious profits. For example, Zoom jumped 108.5% in less than 4 months while most other stocks were sinking.Our 
research shows that 5 cutting-edge stocks could skyrocket from the exponential increase in demand for 'stay at

quickly as possible British Airways CEO lex Cruz has urged ministers to reach agreement with their U.S. 
counterparts on a testing regime.  Getty Images   Shares in Europe's biggest airlines plunged on Monday over fears 
of a second lockdown in response to a second wave of coronavirus cases, while a new report laid bare the massive 
daily cost to the U.K. economy because of the lack of an air link to the U.S. British Airways' owner International 
Airlines Group IAG, -11.04%[1] was the worst performer in a sector that has been consistently hammered[2] by the

Ryanair Holdings RYA, -6.00%[3] fell 6.42%.'The travel industry has again been left reeling after news that the U.K. 
government is seriously considering another national lockdown[4]. British Airways' owner IAG is one of the biggest 
fallers as tougher widespread restrictions on movement are likely to push any recovery for the airline industry even 
further into the future,' said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. 
Read:U.K. edges closer to second national lockdown to help contain second coronavirus wave[5] Separately, a new 
report published on Monday showed that the closed air corridor between the U.S. and the U.K. will cost the U.K. 
economy 32 million ($41 million) a day by the beginning of October. The research, jointly commissioned by Airlines 
U.K., International Airlines Group, Heathrow Airport and aviation services company Collinson, said that the hit to 
U.K. gross domestic product in 2020 could reach at least 11 billion[6], with a significant proportion falling in the 
fourth quarter. Heathrow Airport Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye said this was a 'stark warning' and that action 
is needed immediately to safely open up connections with the U.S., the country's most important economic partner. 
'We can start with flights to New York, a city where infection rates are now lower than here, and which is the U.K.'s 
most valuable route,' Holland-Kaye said. He added: 'PCR [polymerase chain reaction] testing in private labs, both 
preflight and on arrival, would ensure that there is no risk of importing COVID and could pave the way to a Common 
International Standard for aviation testing.' Read:After an unprecedented hard landing, the airline industry is facing

have now embraced airport-based COVID-19 testing and it is now in use at more than half the world's busiest 
airports, including Paris Charles de Gaulle, Tokyo Haneda and Dubai International. Shai Weiss, chief executive of 
Virgin Atlantic[10], which is 49% owned by Delta Air Lines DAL, -10.04%[11], called for urgent government action to 
introduce regional travel corridors for mainland U.S. states, starting with New York and New Jersey where infection 
rates are lower than in the U.K.  '14-day quarantine must be replaced by a robust passenger testing regime for 
countries and regions where the risk is higher,' Weiss said. British Airways Chief Executive lex Cruz cautioned that 
time is running out and called for ministers to reach agreement with their U.S. counterparts on a testing regime that 
minimizes quarantine and permits regional travel corridors to reopen the U.K.-U.S. market.  'They must learn from 
trials across the globe and start implementing new measures as soon as possible to return confidence in flying and 
protect thousands of jobs,' Cruz said. The post Airline stocks fall on lockdown fears as report calls for urgent U.S.-

Sep 21, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] recently announced that it would reduce its October capacity by a further 20% due to coronavirus-related 
travel restrictions by European Union governments. The airline stated that these travel restrictions, often introduced 
at short notices, were affecting forward bookings.In mid-August, the carrier had already announced plans to slash 
its October capacity by 20%[2] due to a drop in bookings following a surge in coronavirus cases in some European 
Union countries. Back then too, fresh travel restrictions had 'notably weakened' Ryanair's forward bookings.With the 
additional capacity reductions, the Irish low-cost airline now expects its October capacity to decrease from 50% to 
approximately 40% of October 2019 levels. Even at this reduced schedule, the airline anticipates to maintain a load 
factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) of more than 70% in October. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price

PLC 
price[3] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[4] Ryanair further warned that 'if current trends and EU Governments' 
mismanagement of the return of air travel and normal economic activity continue,' then there might be similar 
capacity cuts in its winter schedule (November-March).With coronavirus concerns continuing unabated, the airline 
is seeing significantly weak travel demand. 
In its recently released August traffic statistics, the carrier reported a 53% year-over-year plunge in traffic to merely 
7 million guests. Ryanair operated approximately 60% of the normal August schedule with a load factor of 73%. On 
a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 40% to 88.9 million. Zacks

Ryanair cuts capacity in October by another 20%

Ryanair announced that it would cut its October capacity by a further 20% (in addition to the 20% cut already 
announced in mid-August). The operator now expects its October capacity to fall from 50% to approximately 40% of 
its October 2019 levels, but expects to maintain a 70%+ load factor at this reduced schedule.
The LCC confirmed that these capacity reductions were necessary due to damage caused to forward bookings by 
continuous changes in EU Government travel restrictions and policies, many of which are introduced at short 
notice, which undermine consumers' willingness to make forward bookings. In some countries (most notably 
Ireland), where the Government have maintained excessive and defective travel restrictions since 1 July, COVID-19 
rates have risen in recent weeks to 50 per 100,000 population - more than double those of Germany and Italy - 
where intra-EU air travel was freely permitted since 1 July.
The operator welcomed the EU Commission's plan to remove intra-EU travel restrictions, subject only to the 
European Centre for Disease Prevention Control and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention weekly update on 
COVID case/positive test trend rates by EU country and region, and calls for this coordinated approach to be 
immediately implemented by all EU States, especially Ireland, so that EU citizens can make essential bookings for 
business and family travel, free from the worry of flight cancellations and/or defective quarantine restrictions.
A Ryanair Spokesperson said: "We are disappointed to reduce our October capacity from 50% of 2019 to 40%. 
However, as customer confidence is damaged by Government mismanagement of COVID travel policies, many 
Ryanair customers are unable to travel for business or urgent family reasons without being subjected to defective 
14 day quarantines.
While it is too early yet to make final decisions on our winter schedule (from November to March), if current trends 
and EU Governments' mismanagement of the return of air travel and normal economic activity continue, then 
similar capacity cuts may be required across the winter period.
We call on Ireland's Transport Minister Eamon Ryan to explain why over two months later he still hasn't 
implemented any of the 14 recommendations of the Governments Aviation Task Force which were submitted to 
Government on 7 July last. He should also explain why National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has kept 
Ireland locked up like North Korea since 1 July, while at the same time Italy and Germany removed all intra-EU 
travel restrictions and have delivered COVID case rates which are less than half the rate, which NPHET has 
presided over in Ireland. Intra EU air travel is not the problem and these defective travel bans are not a solution."

London Travel groups easyJet, British Airways owner IAG and InterContinental Hotels tumbled as coronavirus 
cases rose sharply across Europe.
Ryanair warned that it could have to slash its winter flight schedule if demand for flying remained low amid travel 
restrictions across Europe.
The airline cut its schedule for October for a second time, saying "continuous" changes to government rules on 
travel had undermined consumers' willingness to make bookings.
J Sainsbury rose after a filing stated that Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who revealed plans this week to launch 
another bid to acquire Germany's Metro, had built up a 3.05 per cent stake in the supermarket chain.
"As a potentially long-term investment from an investor with knowledge and understanding of the retail industry, we 
believe this will probably be seen as a positive," UBS analysts said.
Infrastructure investor John Laing rallied after it said it had agreed to sell its 30 per cent stake in a rolling stock 
project for the East Coast main line in the UK for £421m.
Polymetal slipped after its largest shareholder sold a 4 per cent stake in the Russian precious metal miner. Harry

Ryanair has been forced to cut its capacity in October by a further 20% and may have to do the same for the rest of 
the winter unless European Union governments ease their COVID-19 travel restrictions, it said on Friday.
Michael O'Leary last week described the winter as a "write-off," and said it would fly about 40% of the capacity it 
flew last October, down from a previous target of 50%.
"If current trends and EU governments’ mismanagement of the return of air travel and normal economic activity 
continue, then similar capacity cuts may be required across the winter period," a Ryanair spokeswoman said in a 
statement.
Ryanair's share price fell 4.5% by 0940 GMT.
The capacity reductions, it said, were required because of "damage caused to forward bookings by continuous 
changes in EU government travel restrictions and policies, many of which are introduced at short notice."
It called for a proposed coordinated EU system of restrictions to be implemented immediately.
Airlines across Europe have blamed an uneven patchwork of travel restrictions and quarantine rules for a stop-go 
recovery that has proven tougher than many expected.
Ahead of the latest cuts, O'Leary last week said that he expected to fly about 50 million passengers in the financial 
year to March, one third of the previous year's volume. It did not provide an updated forecast.
Ryanair cuts capacity further, citing travel restrictions
The airline operated capacity of about 67 million seats last winter and a 60% cut would leave its capacity around 27 
million in the final six months of the current financial year, which ends on March 31.
Ryanair flew about 12 million passengers in the first five months of the current financial year and has yet to release 
data for September.
The Ryanair statement said it expects fewer than 30% empty seats on its October flights after the capacity cut, 
against an average of 6% empty seats on flights last winter. (Reuters)

Ryanair will reduce its October capacity by an additional 20% and has warned of more possible cuts over the winter 
months.
Europe's largest ULCC Ryanair is making further capacity cuts next month, blaming "continuous changes" in EU 
government travel restrictions for denting bookings.
The Irish airline will trim October capacity by 20%, on top of a 20% cut already announced in mid-August. Ryanair 
now expects next month's capacity to fall from around 50% to 40% of its October 2019 levels. However, the ULCC 
said it should maintain a load factor of at least 70% at this reduced schedule.
Ryanair said the reductions were necessary because of "damage" caused to forward bookings by changes in 
coronavirus travel restrictions and policies, many of which are being introduced at short notice.
"We are disappointed to reduce our Oct capacity from 50% of 2019 to 40%. However, as customer confidence is 
damaged by government mismanagement of COVID travel policies, many Ryanair customers are unable to travel 
for business or urgent family reasons without being subjected to defective 14-day quarantines," a spokesperson 
said.
The spokesperson added it was "too early" to make final decisions on Ryanair's winter schedule, which runs from 
November to March, but warned that if current trends and the "mismanagement" of restrictions continue then 
"similar capacity cuts may be required."
Ryanair Group-which includes Ryanair, Buzz, Malta Air and Lauda-offered 14.4 million departure seats during 
October 2019 across almost 76,300 flights, data provided by OAG Schedules Analyser shows. The latest cuts 
suggest total capacity next month will be closer to 5.7 million seats.

Ryanair suffered a significant shareholder revolt yesterday over plans to pay chief executive Michael O'Leary a 
(EURO)458,000 bonus despite the airline furloughing staff and taking state support in response to the pandemic.
A third of the carrier's investors voted against the airline's non-binding remuneration report, which included Mr 
O'Leary's bonus payout for the year up to the end of March 2020, at the annual meeting in Dublin.
Mr O'Leary's base pay for the financial year ending in 2021 will be cut by half to (EURO)250,000.
The rebellion was larger than what British Airways owner International Airlines Group suffered this month, when 20 
per cent of investors voted against its pay plan. This included an £883,000 bonus for IAG boss Willie Walsh.
It is the second year in a row Ryanair has faced protests from shareholders. Last year only 50 per cent voted in 
favour of the pay report after Mr O'Leary agreed a five-year contract, including 10m in share options.
Investor adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended a vote against the pay report for the financial 
year to the end of March because it was "difficult to justify".
The world's biggest proxy adviser criticised a bonus that was about 92 per cent of the maximum Mr O'Leary could 
receive at a time when the industry is in turmoil and suffering its worst crisis.
Glass Lewis, the world's second-biggest proxy adviser, had urged shareholders to abstain. In the final count, about 
65 per cent voted in favour, 33 per cent against with 2 per cent abstaining.

Ryanair declined to comment on the pay report.
The protests are the latest sign that executive bonuses are becoming a flashpoint for investors concerned about 
how companies are reacting to the pandemic. Asset managers such as M&G have warned that some bosses are 
not sharing the pain and are enjoying large payouts, despite businesses furloughing staff and cutting dividends.
Ryanair has so far claimed £600m in the Bank of England's Covid Corporate Financing Facility, as well as making 
use of the UK's Job Retention Scheme.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) reported that it would lower its October capacity by another 20% on top of the 20% 
reduction already announced by the company in August. 
The Irish airline operator said it now expects its October capacity to fall from 50% to approximately 40% of its 
October 2019 levels, but expects to maintain a load factor of at least 70% at the reduced schedule.
The airline blamed the capacity reductions on continuous changes in EU government travel restrictions and 
policies, many of which it said have been introduced at short notice, which undermine consumers' willingness to 
make forward bookings.
"As customer confidence is damaged by government mismanagement of Covid travel policies, many Ryanair 
customers are unable to travel for business or urgent family reasons without being subjected to defective 14 day 
quarantines," a Ryanair spokesperson said. "If current trends and EU governments' mismanagement of the return 
of air travel and normal economic activity continue, then similar capacity cuts may be required across the winter 
period."

unusual hurricane-like storm has reached Greece, flooding western islands and disrupting aviation. Coastguards 
say a boat carrying 55 migrants is adrift in the poor conditions.Storm Ianos, classed by forecasters as a rare 
hurricane-like "medicane," downed trees and caused flooding and power outages on Greece's Ionian islands on 
Friday, packing winds of up to 117 kilometers (73 miles) per hour.Coastguards said a boat carrying some 55 
migrants was in distress off the Peloponnese peninsula, southwest of Athens, and urged vessels in the area to 
assist.National weather researcher Kostas Lagouvardos on state ERT television cautioned: "We have another 36 
hours of intense conditions ahead of us."Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said Ianos was likely to 
"remain west" and then head south, but could still bring heavy rain to the Athens region on Saturday.Read more:

Ryanair to cut capacity by 20 per cent, blames pandemic travel rules

Dateline: Dublin (dpa) - 
Body
Ryanair said on Friday that it will slash capacity by 20 per cent in October, blaming coronavirus travel curbs 
introduced at short notice.
Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, said "EU government travel restrictions and policies" aimed at 
stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus "undermine consumers' willingness to make forward bookings."
Announcing its second 20 per cent capacity reduction since August, Ryanair accused the Irish government of 
keeping the country "locked up like North Korea" and of operating "a defective" quarantine system that 
means arrivals from most countries, some with lower infection rates than Ireland, are expected to self-isolate for 14 
days.
Supported by Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag carrier airline, Ryanair has taken the government to court over the curbs, 
which will not be aligned with EU guidelines until mid-October.
On Wednesday, lawyers representing the government told Ireland's High Court that the measures are not 
mandatory.
The government on Thursday cut Italy and Greece from its "green list" of countries from where arrivals are not 
expected to self-isolate but added Germany.

unusual hurricane-like storm has reached Greece, flooding western islands and disrupting aviation. Coastguards 
say a boat carrying 55 migrants is adrift in the poor conditions.Storm Ianos, classed by forecasters as a rare 
hurricane-like "medicane," downed trees and caused flooding and power outages on Greece's Ionian islands on 
Friday, packing winds of up to 117 kilometers (73 miles) per hour.Coastguards said a boat carrying some 55 
migrants was in distress off the Peloponnese peninsula, southwest of Athens, and urged vessels in the area to 
assist.National weather researcher Kostas Lagouvardos on state ERT television cautioned: "We have another 36 
hours of intense conditions ahead of us."Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said Ianos was likely to 
"remain west" and then head south, but could still bring heavy rain to the Athens region on Saturday.Read more:

Ryanair investors back O'Leary bonus, but a third withhold support
Ryanair investors back O'Leary bonus, but a third withhold support

Ryanair shareholders backed a €458,000 bonus for Group CEO Michael O'Leary on Thursday, although more than 
a third withheld their support following criticism of the payout at a time of industry crisis.
Shareholders approved the Irish budget carrier's remuneration report, which included the award, with 65.8% in 
favor, the company said in a statement.
Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had said the pay award for the financial year ended in March 
"raises concerns" and was hard to justify amid the unprecedented aviation crisis sparked by COVID-19.
O'Leary's base salary and maximum bonus for the year to the end of March 2020 were each cut by 50% to 500,000 
euros, according to the company's annual report.
Speaking to Reuters in an interview last week ahead of the annual general meeting (AGM), O'Leary said those cuts 
"by any measure would be indicative of the board responding appropriately to the pandemic."
"I'd like to see what the chief executive of ISS, what his pay was reduced by over the past 12 months. It'll certainly 
be less than mine," O'Leary added.
A spokeswoman for ISS said it did not disclose executive pay as it was a private company. "We don't make such 
disclosures," she said.
O'Leary's pay has proved contentious before. His five-year bonus plan, worth up to €100 million if targets related to 
share price and profitability are hit, scraped through with 50.5% support in a shareholder vote last September.
Ryanair investors back O'Leary bonus, but a third withhold support
ISS also recommended shareholders in Ryanair rival IAG, which owns British Airways and Aer Lingus, reject a 
payment of &pound;883,000 pounds to departing chief executive Willie Walsh. That payment that was approved by 
shareholders last week.

Italy and Greece taken off green list

The government today tightened its COVID-19 travel restrictions by imposing quarantines on travellers from major 
holiday markets Italy and Greece, angering the country's dominant airlines Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus said it was concerned by the fact the government had repeatedly indicated in recent weeks it planned to 
adopt a more liberal European Commission proposal, but instead cut back the number of countries exempt from 
quarantine.
Ireland had initially waived quarantine for travellers from countries with lower COVID-19 rates, but as its 14-day 
infection rate surged to above 50 cases per 100,000, the government said only places half that rate would be 
exempt.
The move came as the head of Ireland's COVID-19 modelling group on Wednesday warned of "exponential growth" 
without new restrictions.
The new "Green List", which goes into effect on Monday, allows travellers arriving from just seven countries to 
avoid quarantine: Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
The Commission envisages the removal of travel restrictions on countries with 14-day infection rates of under 50 
per 100,000. The Taoiseach has promised to implement the EU rules once they are officially approved on Oct. 13.
"The 'green list' announced today does not represent a step towards alignment with the European Commission’s 
free movement proposal," Aer Lingus said in a statement.
Italy and Greece taken off green list
Ryanair, which is taking a case to the Irish High Court challenging the legality of the quarantine rules, said the 
aviation and tourism sectors "cannot afford any further delays or indecision."
The airline has threatened to close bases in the country's second and third largest airports, Shannon and Cork, for 
the winter unless restrictions are eased.
On Thursday Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said capacity at Dublin airport may also be cut. (Reuters)

Will France 's 150 airports survive?
Will France's 150 airports survive?

The French government has allocated (EURO)15billion to sustain the sector, which the International Air Transport 
Association says is facing 466,100 job losses in France alone. The industry must also confront environmental 
challenges, including a move to greener energy with solar, electric and hybrid planes.
Despite all this, award-winning French aviation journalist Gil Roy argues there is still plenty of life in France's 
airports - great and small.
French airports affected by Covid-19
Fears that the small regional airports that provided easy pre-Covid links with the UK might be in danger will 
probably not materialise. There are around 150 airports in the French airports trade body - one of the highest 
numbers among EU countries - and even before the pandemic there were occasional calls for a rationalisation of 
the network.
Last year, for example, some councillors in Normandy said having three council-funded airports - Le Havre, 
Deauville and Caen - within 30km of each other was too expensive. Author and journalist Gil Roy, who runs the 
Aerobuzz.fr website and who was awarded France's Médaille de l'Aéronautique for his contribution to spreading 
knowledge about aeronautics in France, said his opinion is that all airports will remain open.
"They are owned by towns and other local government bodies, and people are very, very proud of them," he said. 
"Even when it involves a big financial sacrifice, people will do all they can to keep airports open, as a matter of local 
pride, and also because of the tangible economic and other benefits that they bring."
The problem is more likely to come, he warned, from the airlines, especially low-cost providers such as Ryanair and 
Easyjet that serve smaller regional airports.
Futures unclear
"The airports are prepared to pay to continue the services they have, but it is not clear whether the airlines will 
return to the routes they had in the past," he said. An example of how local authorities are determined to keep their 
airports is Angoulême, which lengthened its runway to attract Ryanair - and then lost the service after a short time 
in a legal row over how much the owners of the airport should pay the airline to land there.
Will France 's 150 airports survive?
For a while, it had regular flights linking Angoulême with Corsica during the holiday season and a regular "air taxi" 
linking the city with Lyon, but they also stopped. Since then, the airport has remained open, with a helicopter 
training school and aircraft maintenance companies providing its only revenue. A flying club also uses the facilities.
Mr Roy said the legal disputes at Angoulême had served as a wake-up call to other airports. "Since then, they have 
been very clear that the agreements they sign with airlines and others meet all the government's rules and all 
Europe's rules," he said. "It is unlikely that even if the Cour des Comptes [France's official controlling body of state 
expenditure] opened an investigation, it would be able to fault the airports."
What are Air France's plans?
Air France has published a list of airports it hopes to be able to use by this month, linking the provinces with Paris 
Charles de Gaulle. The airports are: Biarritz, Bordeaux, Brest, Clermont Ferrand, Lorient, Lyon, Marseille, 
Montpellier, Mulhouse, Nantes, Nice, Pau, Rennes, and Toulouse.
In addition, services to Aurillac, Brive, Castres and Lourdes, where the airline holds a Délégation de Service Public 
grant to provide links to Paris, are due to start later. Bordeaux is included on the list, even though the airline was 
told to stop flying routes where TGV trains made the same journey in under 2h30 minutes. Air France got an 
exception for flights to Charles de Gaulle because the airport is a hub for international travel. Air France flights 
between Orly airport in Paris and Bordeaux have been scrapped.

Fifteen vacation destinations are being added to Lufthansa's network from Frankfurt for the summer 2021 season.
Lufthansa said it is responding to passenger demand by increasing the number of leisure routes offered from its 
Frankfurt (FRA) hub.
Fifteen short-haul destinations are being added to the Star Alliance member's network for the summer 2021 
season. Greece and Spain are a key focus-collectively accounting for nine of the 15 new services-but flights are 
also being added to Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, Italy and Tunisia.
"Never before have we included so many new vacation destinations in our program," Lufthansa executive Harry 
Hohmeister said.
"This is our response to the wishes of our customers. The demand for vacation and leisure trips is recovering much 
faster than that for business trips."
By deploying up to five additional aircraft, Lufthansa plans to offer around 70 weekly connections to 29 tourist 
destinations from FRA, 15 more than in the same period last year.
The airline said the new routes would depart the German airport in the morning and arrive in the evening in order to 
maximize time at the destinations for passengers.
The southern European airports being added to Lufthansa's FRA network are Chania (CHQ), Corfu (CFU), 
Djerba (DJE), Hurghada (HRG), Jerez de la Frontera (XRY), Kavala (KVA), Kos (KGS), Lamezia Terme (SUF), 
Mykonos (JMK), Paphos (PFO), Preveza (PVK), Rijeka (RJK) and Varna (VAR). Winter service to Gran Canaria 
(LPA) and Tenerife South (TFS) will also be maintained in summer 2021.
As reported by Airlineroute, two of the 15 routes are resumptions. Lufthansa previously served Djerba, an island off 
the coast of Tunisia, until October 1983. The carrier also operated flights to Jerez de la Frontera (pictured), a city in 
Spain's Andalusia region, in July and August 2013.
The leisure additions to Lufthansa's network from FRA come as subsidiary Eurowings confirmed plans to add a 
slew of vacation destinations in Greece, Portugal and Spain from Dusseldorf (DUS).
Lufthansa ramps up Frankfurt's short-haul leisure offer
The low-cost unit is taking advantage of Ryanair's base closure at DUS by taking over up to 95% of the routes that 
have been operated by the Irish carrier.
The extended flying program includes services to Spanish vacation destinations Alicante (ALC), Fuerteventura 
(FUE), Ibiza (IBZ), LPA, Malaga (AGP), Palma de Mallorca (PMI) and TFS; Corfu (CFU), Heraklion (HER), KGS 
and Rhodes (RHO) in Greece; and Faro (FAO) in Portugal.
Earlier this week, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr reported passenger traffic levels are currently less than 20% of 
2019 levels, but he expressed hope that demand would be at minus 25% by the end of the year. That is still around 
half of a projection he gave earlier in the pandemic.
OAG Schedules Analyser data shows Lufthansa is this week (w/c Sept. 14) offering about 507,000 departure seats 
across 3,500 flights. This compares with 1.9 million seats and 11,200 flights during the same week a year ago.

Eurowings takes over majority of Ryanair routes from Düsseldorf

Lufthansa's LCC steps in to offer flights from DUS to the vacation destinations in Greece, Portugal and Spain.
Lufthansa LCC subsidiary Eurowings is taking advantage of Ryanair's base closure at Düsseldorf International 
Airport (DUS) in Germany as it plans to take over up to 95% of the routes that have been operated by the Irish 
carrier.
The increased flight program should start on Oct. 24, the day when Ryanair wet-lease operator Laudamotion closes 
its base at DUS, which will see the loss of 150 crew jobs and seven Airbus A320 from the airport. Laudamotion co-
CEO Andreas Gruber previously told Aviation Week Network that the decision to close the DUS base was made by 
parent Ryanair, which is also closing its base at Stuttgart Airport (STR) on Sept. 30 affecting 70 jobs.
Eurowings CEO Jens Bischof said in a Sept. 15 statement that the closure of the Ryanair bases in Stuttgart and 
Düsseldorf was just the beginning. "With a closer look, the ultra-low-cost business model all over Germany is on its 
way to shrinking... Our clients don't search for tickets of (EURO)5 in times of a crisis, they are demanding an airline 
in which they can trust."
The number of Eurowings destinations from Düsseldorf-where the airline is headquartered-increases now to more

Lufthansa's LCC steps in to offer flights from DUS to the vacation destinations in Greece, Portugal and Spain.
Lufthansa LCC subsidiary Eurowings is taking advantage of Ryanair's base closure at Düsseldorf International 
Airport (DUS) in Germany as it plans to take over up to 95% of the routes that have been operated by the Irish 
carrier.
The increased flight program should start on Oct. 24, the day when Ryanair wet-lease operator Laudamotion closes 
its base at DUS, which will see the loss of 150 crew jobs and seven Airbus A320 from the airport. Laudamotion co-
CEO Andreas Gruber previously told Aviation Week Network that the decision to close the DUS base was made by 
parent Ryanair, which is also closing its base at Stuttgart Airport (STR) on Sept. 30 affecting 70 jobs.
Eurowings CEO Jens Bischof said in a Sept. 15 statement that the closure of the Ryanair bases in Stuttgart and 
Düsseldorf was just the beginning. "With a closer look, the ultra-low-cost business model all over Germany is on its 
way to shrinking... Our clients don't search for tickets of (EURO)5 in times of a crisis, they are demanding an airline 
in which they can trust."
The number of Eurowings destinations from Düsseldorf-where the airline is headquartered-increases now to more 
than 80. The extended flying program includes services to Spanish vacation destinations Alicante (ALC), 
Fuerteventura (FUE), Gran Canaria (LPA), Ibiza (IBZ), Malaga (AGP), Palma de Mallorca (PMI) and Tenerife (TFS); 
Corfu (CFU), Heraklion (HER), Kos (KGS) and Rhodes (RHO) in Greece; and Faro (FAO) in Portugal.
Aviation Week Network understands that Eurowings has enough capacity available to handle the additional flight 
offering.
On Sept. 2 Eurowings said it would fly around 50 aircraft this autumn, but that will now likely be fewer as demand 
has weakened. From its current 90-strong fleet, the Lufthansa subsidiary has around 40 aircraft in long-term 
storage. "We have too many aircraft," Bischof said Sept. 2.

The LCC will begin domestic service in November, offering four routes form Nantes and one from Paris Orly.
A month after Air France-KLM Group secured the green light from pilots on plans for subsidiary Transavia France to 
fly domestic routes, the carrier has unveiled the first services it intends to operate.
Reservations are now open for five routes on departure from its bases at Paris Orly (ORY) and Nantes (NTE). 
Transavia's CCO Nicolas Hénin described the entry into the domestic market as "a new chapter in the company's 
development."
From Nov. 2, the low-cost unit will connect ORY with Biarritz (BIQ) 19X-weekly, in addition to Air France's services 
from Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG).
Four routes from NTE will join Transavia's network, connecting the city in the Upper Brittany region with Marseille 
(MRS) 10X-weekly, Toulouse (TLS) 10X-weekly, Montpellier (MPL) 5X-weekly and Nice (NCE) 4X-weekly. All 
routes will be operated by Boeing 737-800NG, equipped with 189 seats.
TLS chairman Philippe Crébassa welcomed Transavia's entry to the NTE-TLS market, saying the lower cost flights 
would help to cater for rising levels of domestic demand in recent months as a consequence of the COVID-19 
pandemic.
The airline said it plans to announce further domestic routes "soon" as well as continuing the development of its 
medium-haul network from bases at ORY, NTE, Lyon (LYS) and MPL.
The launch of Transavia's inaugural domestic routes follows an agreement in August between Air France-KLM's 
management team and pilots' union SNPL, with the union backing an overhaul of Air France's domestic network.
"This network has been loss-making for several years despite continuous restructuring since 2000 and is subject to 
strong competition faced with the constant growth of low-cost airlines and the TGV high-speed train network," the 
airline group said at the time.
"This agreement permits Transavia to operate routes within France, and adjusts pilot guarantees pertaining to 
European network activity in line with the levels of activity expected on the domestic network over the coming 
years."
Transavia France launches first domestic routes
More than 90% of voting union members backed the domestic network restructure, with a turnout exceeding 82%. 
The agreement is the second with SNPL designed to facilitate the expansion of Transavia after a deal was reached 
last year to increase its French fleet beyond 40 aircraft.
According to data provided by OAG Schedules Analyser, Air France is currently the only operator of ORY-BIQ 
flights although easyJet serves BIQ from CDG.
Transavia will compete with Ryanair on NTE-MRS and with easyJet and Volotea on NTE-TLS and NTE-NCE. 
Volotea also serves NTE-MPL up to 2X-daily with easyJet set to begin the route in October.

 Ireland's new rules for travel may remove Greece and Italy from its COVID-19 green list, which exempts individuals 
from included countries from travel restrictions, Reuters reported Tuesday.
Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) condemned the update in a statement on Twitter saying it was "more 
delay and indecision from Micheál Martin's Government and NPHET."
The government agreed that inclusion in the green list will require a cumulative disease incidence rate of 25 or 
fewer cases per 100,000, based on the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Ryanair's stock was down nearly 1% on Tuesday's close.

Ryanair expects the European Commission this week to unveil a new system of COVID-19 travel advice that will 
open up most regions of the continent to travel without quarantine, Chief Executive Eddie Wilson said on Monday.
The European Commission earlier this month proposed a common traffic light system for EU member states to 
coordinate border controls and remedy the current, confusing patchwork of coronavirus restrictions on travelers 
across Europe.
"I think you'll see the vast majority of Europe and UK returned into a green zone and then it'll be up to the individual 
health authorities to follow up on track and tracing them," Wilson told Ireland's RTE radio. (Reuters)

How spending patterns changed UNDER LOCKDOWN

FT Money asked Starling Bank, one of the new digital challenger banks, for some insight on how our spending 
patterns have changed this year.
Not surprisingly, travel and transport were among the hardest hit areas of spending. Transport for London recorded 
a 95 per cent drop in spending during lockdown, although it has since bounced back to 60 per cent of pre-Covid 
levels.
However, the fear of using public transport has also boosted applications for car finance by nearly 25 per cent in 
July and August compared with a year previously, according to separate data last week.
Starling found transactions with airline Ryanair fell 95 per cent during lockdown, although spend has now recovered 
to almost 30 per cent of pre-March numbers. Airbnb was another casualty, with an 86 per cent drop in transactions 
during lockdown, which Starling said has only recovered by around 7 per cent since. However, food sales have 
soared. Spending at Tesco increased by 60 per cent during lockdown, while upmarket rival Waitrose was not far 
behind with an uptick of 42 per cent, both fuelled by increased demand for home delivery services.
Takeaways were popular too: Just Eat's transactions increased by 20 per cent during the past few months.
Internet shopping won hands down over the high street: Amazon spending jumped 82 per cent in lockdown, with 
average transaction values up 18 per cent.
How spending patterns changed UNDER LOCKDOWN
Anne Boden, chief executive and founder of Starling Bank, said the data indicated some "green shoots of recovery" 
in transport, travel and high street shopping. "We mustn't think we are out of the woods, but we are going in the 
right direction," she said.

FTSE steady after positive week despite recovery, pound and Brexit doubts

Highlight: FTSE 100 hangs on to this week's gains after the US tech sell-off as investors digest mixed signals on 
UK's recovery, fresh travel restrictions and weak pound.
Body
UK markets were placid on Friday morning, hanging onto a week of solid gains, as traders digested the mixed 
signals from data on the economy’s recovery, a volatile pound and fresh travel retrictions. 
The UK’s economy expanded 6.6% in July as sectors like pubs and restaurants reopened, according to data from 
the Office for National Statistics. That was in line with expectations, but after a 20% contraction in the first quarter, 
output remained 11.7% below its pre-pandemic level in February.
‘While there was a marked bounce back in July, the economy is still languishing way below pre-pandemic levels 
with so many sectors of the economy suffering from a drop in demand,’ said Susannah Streeter, senior investment 
and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
‘Consumer confidence has taken a battering and with the fresh tightening of social distancing rules once again, it’s 
likely to take another hit.
‘Already we have seen how newly imposed quarantine rules have affected the travel industry with British Airways’ 
owner IAG (IAG) and Easyjet (EZJ) announcing more flight cancellations this week due to a fall in bookings and 
Ryanair (RYA) calling the upcoming winter “a write off”.’
The FTSE 100 teetered around the 6,000 mark in early trading, before striking ahead 0.32%, up 20 points, to 6,022.
That came despite losses in US markets yesterday, with the S&P 500 retreating 1.76% after the Senate voted down 
a fresh economic relief package.
Sterling firmed 0.2% against the dollar and stabilised above the $1.28 mark at $1.283 but remained on course for a 
3% loss this week and its worst five-day performance since March.
The weakness in the pound has been caused by fears of a messy hard Brexit as the UK government announced 
plans to break international law by breaching the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement treaty signed with the EU in 
January. The European Commission threatened legal action yesterday, but Boris Johnson’s government has vowed 
to press ahead with debating the controversial legislation on Monday.
FTSE steady after positive week despite recovery, pound and Brexit doubts
‘This was the week when Brexit returned as a live issue for the markets. In the short-term the increased chances of 
a messy exit from the EU have been a tailwind for the UK’s flagship stock market index which looks on course for a 
positive week despite investors being challenged elsewhere by heavy selling on US markets,’ said AJ Bell 
investment director Russ Mould.
‘This is not a surprise, after all the FTSE 100 has international horizons and the resulting weakness in the pound 
has boosted the relative value of constituents’ overseas earnings.’
Over the week the blue-chip index has risen 3.9%, or 224 points, shaking off the tech-sell off in the US. The FTSE 
250 has gained 251 points, or 1.4%, over five days.
Among blue-chips, IAG was the biggest faller today, down 3.7% to 192.9p, after Portugal was added to the 
quarantine list yesterday.
Banks were also weak. Barclays (BARC) fell 1.8% to 103.2p, Lloyds (LLOY) by 1.7% to 26.0p and and Standard 
Chartered (STAN) 1.3% to 379.6p.
Burberry (BRBY) was the biggest gainer, up 2.9% to £15.38, with the market liking plans for the luxury retailer’s 
first issue of green bonds. 
Flutter Entertainment (FLTR) and Anglo American (AAL) were the next biggest gainers. The Betfair-owner rose 
2.2% to £117.65 while the mining firm ticked up 1.9% to £18.97.
Rio Tinto (RIO) also rose 1.5%, to £48.55, as chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques bowed to investor pressure 
to step down, drawing a line under a scandal over the destrution of ancient Aboriginal sites in Australia. 
The ‘mid-cap’ FTSE 250 index advanced 0.27%, or 47 points, to 17,621.
Royal Mail (RMG) lead the risers, jumping 7% to 236p, as investors continued to respond positively to this week’s 
trading update showing rapid growth in its parcels business during the pandemic.
Cineworld Group (CINE) led a rally in some beaten-up leisure stocks, advancing 6.1% to 52.6p.
B2B events and information business Ascential (ASCL) fell 5.3% to 294p while Wood Group (WG) retreated 3.7% 
to 221p as oil prices remained on the back foot.

risks 'ruin' without support as it seeks emergency funds

British Airways owner IAG has launched a steeply discounted (EURO)2.75bn rights issue to help shore up its 
finances through the disruption caused by coronavirus. The airline group also warned it expected to carry fewer 
passengers than forecast this year and next as travel restrictions and quarantine measures hamper its recovery.
Alex Cruz, BA chief executive, was one of several UK airline executives to write to the prime minister yesterday to 
plead for further support including testing on arrival. The letter, seen by the Financial Times, said the industry risked 
"ruin" otherwise.
IAG, which announced the emergency fundraising in July alongside a (EURO)2bn second-quarter loss, will issue 
nearly 3bn new shares at (EURO)0.92 each, a 36 per cent discount based on the new fully expanded share capital. 
Current shareholders will be entitled to buy three of the new shares for each two shares they currently own.
Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy Research, said the discount was steeper than he had expected. The shareholder 
dilution was also more than he expected.
"You can see what they are trying to do, raise the money no matter what," he said. "The key was just to raise the 
money, the price was just a secondary thought."
BA owner launches (EURO)2.75bn rights issue; Airlines IAG warns industry risks 'ruin' without support as it 
seeks emergency funds
The rights issue won the overwhelming support of shareholders at IAG's annual meeting in Madrid this week. Qatar 
Airways, IAG's largest shareholder, which has steadily been building its stake in the airline group since 2015, took 
up its share entitlement in full.
IAG, which suffered a shareholder revolt over pay to top bosses including departed chief executive Willie Walsh, 
said it expected to be able to survive a "prolonged downturn" in air travel, and was confident it would emerge from 
the crisis as a more nimble and flexible company.
It has already cut more than 8,000 of its planned 13,000 jobs at BA, largely through voluntary redundancies.
The airline also said it had reached an agreement in principle over its restructuring at BA with union Unite, with a

24 per cent previously expected.

British Airways owner IAG has launched a steeply discounted (EURO)2.75bn rights issue to help shore up its 
finances through the disruption caused by coronavirus. The airline group also warned it expected to carry fewer 
passengers than forecast this year and next as travel restrictions and quarantine measures hamper its recovery.
Alex Cruz, BA chief executive, was one of several UK airline executives to write to the prime minister yesterday to 
plead for further support including testing on arrival. The letter, seen by the Financial Times, said the industry risked 
"ruin" otherwise.
IAG, which announced the emergency fundraising in July alongside a (EURO)2bn second-quarter loss, will issue 
nearly 3bn new shares at (EURO)0.92 each, a 36 per cent discount based on the new fully expanded share capital. 
Current shareholders will be entitled to buy three of the new shares for each two shares they currently own.
Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy Research, said the discount was steeper than he had expected. The shareholder 
dilution was also more than he expected.
"You can see what they are trying to do, raise the money no matter what," he said. "The key was just to raise the 
money, the price was just a secondary thought."

The rights issue won the overwhelming support of shareholders at IAG's annual meeting in Madrid this week. Qatar 
Airways, IAG's largest shareholder, which has steadily been building its stake in the airline group since 2015, took 
up its share entitlement in full.
IAG, which suffered a shareholder revolt over pay to top bosses including departed chief executive Willie Walsh, 
said it expected to be able to survive a "prolonged downturn" in air travel, and was confident it would emerge from 
the crisis as a more nimble and flexible company.
It has already cut more than 8,000 of its planned 13,000 jobs at BA, largely through voluntary redundancies.
The airline also said it had reached an agreement in principle over its restructuring at BA with union Unite, with a 
ballot of members set to follow in the coming weeks.

Sep 11, 2020( Coolsmartphone: http://www.coolsmartphone.com Delivered by Newstex)  EE has announced their 
latest report into the changing habits and trends of their customers. It shows how the usage of services and apps 
has changed recently, as lockdown came in and then eased off. 
https://www.coolsmartphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image015.jpg What's perhaps not too surprising, as 
the lockdown restrictions eased some weeks ago, was how traffic to travel and holiday websites more than doubled. 
EE saw sites like Airbnb, Booking.com, EasyJet, Ryanair and Skyscanner getting a big increase in usage and 
requests. This came as people fought to secure holidays and quick getaways in the sun. However, recent 
quarantine and restrictions on gatherings have meant that a lot of potential breaks are now either on hold or 
cancelled. 
https://www.coolsmartphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/andre-hunter-ndyfVMhl8qI-unsplash.jpg 
Likewise, being stuck inside, many online gaming sites like Mr Bet slots[1] have seen a big rise in usage. The 
enforced shut-in has meant that many are turning to digital distractions in greater numbers, with mobile gaming 
studios enjoying a big increase in profits and players enjoying the odd payout via sites like goto syndicate.casino[2]. 
The big increase in leisure time for more than 2bn smartphone owners has meant that gamers have found new 
games, new skills and now there's been a massive increase in mobile advertising revenue too. The massive mobile 
gaming revenues now put PC and console spending firmly in the shade, with smartphones earning developers 
$100bn this year. The advent of 'free to play' games, which allow free entry with in-game purchases earning a 
continual revenue stream for developers, has proved hugely successful with smartphone gamers. 
https://www.coolsmartphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image021.jpg As we exit lockdown and enter a new 
period of restrictions, there's been an explosion of movement in-between. EE tracked smartphones and saw 
customers moving around the UK far more during the May bank holiday and June heatwaves. Previously there was 
a relatively strong adherence to the lockdown measures. Likewise, traffic to fitness apps such as Strava reduced 
massively during the lockdown. Instead - along with gaming - the network saw a big rise in streaming video usage 
on sites like YouTube, Netflix and Prime Video. [ 1]: https://mr.bet/casino/type/slot [ 2]: https://syndicate.casino

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) launched and sold an EUR850 million euro (USD1 billion) bond on September 7, which 
was more than five times oversubscribed, and also raised EUR400 million (USD470 million) in a share placement 
on September 3, shoring up the company's balance sheet. This was its first euro-bond sale since 2017, and the fact 
that investors put in EUR4.4 billion (USD5.2 billion) worth of orders for it was a sign that debt markets in Europe are 
starting to reopen to airlines, according to Reuters. It was the second bond issue by a European airline since the 
coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on passenger travel. 
As previously reported, Finnair (AY, Helsinki Vantaa) issued a hybrid bond on August 27. Ryanair's earlier share 
placement was via a "non-pre-emptive placing of new ordinary shares [...] in the capital of the company to 
institutional investors and certain others," the airline said in a stock exchange filing the day after the placing. A total 
of 35,242,291 new ordinary shares were placed, raising gross proceeds at just over the EUR400 million mark. 
These shares represent around 3.2% of the company's issued share capital before the placing. "Certain directors 
and members of the senior management team" also participated in the placement, buying 1,444,101 new shares at 
the placing price, Ryanair said in its statement. The airline said that the money raised was likely to "create 
opportunities for Ryanair to grow its network, and expand its fleet, to take advantage of lower airport and aircraft 
cost opportunities that are likely to arise." It added that the placing "is expected to help better position the group to 
move quickly to capitalise on such opportunities should they arise [and] should significantly de-risk the group's debt 
repayments over the next 12 months."

What you need to know ? Rebound in tech stocks helps lift global equity markets higher ? Tourism-related stocks 
slide after Ryanair scales back passenger forecasts ? Brent crude bounces back from steep falls, climbing above 
$40 Global stocks bounced back yesterday, snapping a three-session rout in some of Wall Street's largest tech 
companies.
Tesla, the electric car company, was up more than 5 per cent at lunchtime, having plummeted by a fifth the day 
before.
The move higher followed a 4 per cent tumble in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite on Tuesday, which was 
deemed a correction as defined by a 10 per cent decline from a recent peak.
In spite of the retreat, the Nasdaq is still up more than 20 per cent for the year and 60 per cent since its March lows.
Wall Street's major indices were all higher at lunchtime in New York with the S&P 500 up 2 per cent, the Nasdaq 
climbing 2.5 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.9 per cent higher.
Joe Little, chief strategist at HSBC Global Asset Management, said the resilient performance of equities and muted 
reaction in the bond market was a positive sign that the tech rout had not spread panic to other corners of the 
market.
The yield on US Treasuries, an asset often bought during times of market stress, barely moved, edging up 1 basis 
point to 0.70 per cent yesterday.
The day in the markets
The sell-off looked "similar to the phase in early June when we saw a little bit of ratcheting down and consolidation", 
Mr Little added. "The fact that we haven't seen a spillover into other asset classes is important."
European bourses also rebounded. The region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 closed up 1.6 per cent, despite stocks linked 
to tourism weighing on the benchmark.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said it expected to carry fewer passengers than forecast in the 12 months 
to the end of March with the carrier warning that this winter would be "a write-off".
While shares in Ryanair rose after the statement, owing to "one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry", 
said Citi analysts, sector peers slid. Budget airline easyJet fell, as did travel group Tui and British Airways owner 
IAG.
The euro gained 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.1818 on a Bloomberg report that the European Central Bank's 
growth and inflation projections due today would only change slightly.
Oil prices clawed back some ground lost following steep falls on Tuesday that were triggered by fears that global 
demand for crude was waning.

? Rebound in tech stocks helps lift global equity markets higher ? Tourism-related stocks slide after Ryanair scales 
back passenger forecasts ? Brent crude bounces back from steep falls, climbing above $40 Global stocks bounced 
back yesterday, snapping a three-session rout in some of Wall Street's largest tech companies.
Tesla, the electric car company, was up more than 5 per cent at lunchtime, having plummeted by a fifth the day 
before.
The move higher followed a 4 per cent tumble in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite on Tuesday, which was 
deemed a correction as defined by a 10 per cent decline from a recent peak.
In spite of the retreat, the Nasdaq is still up more than 20 per cent for the year and 60 per cent since its March lows.

US and European airlines warned yesterday of a grim outlook for the coming months, cutting back schedules as 
passengers continue to avoid air travel during the pandemic.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, reduced its forecast for passengers it expects to carry in the fiscal year to 
March, as the carrier warned that this winter would be "a write-off".
Finnair, Finland's flagship airline, said it would operate no more than 80 flights daily in October compared with the 
200 previously planned.
In the US, United Airlines said its capacity would fall 70 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2019. Earlier 
guidance was a fall of 65 per cent.
Revenue, too, will be lower than executives had forecast: down 85 per cent from the $11.4bn a year earlier, not 83 
per cent.
The cutbacks are part of a pattern in which airlines announce ambitious flying schedules only to trim them as 
departure dates approach and passengers fail to materialise. Industry body Iata said airlines globally were projected 
to lose a record $84bn this year.
Airlines cut flights after passengers fail to return
EasyJet cut its flight schedule earlier this week. Now Ryanair expects to carry 50m passengers in the 12 months to 
the end of March, down from the 60m projected in July. It had forecast more than 150m passengers before the 
pandemic.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the airline might cut more flights in the coming months.
The industry's recovery hopes have been hit hard by rising coronavirus cases across Europe and parts of the US. It 
is pushing for testing on arrival at airports to help cut quarantine times and encourage people back into the sky.
Airlines are also adapting to an environment where business travel has been hit particularly hard by focusing on 
leisure travel and customers flying to see friends and family.
United said it would launch seven new long-haul routes from the US over the next year: two from mainland cities to 
Hawaii, and five connecting diaspora populations to India and Africa.
"We're really focused on rethinking the network," said Patrick Quayle, United's vice-president of international 
network and alliances. "We're not just looking at adding everything back prior to the way it was before coronavirus."

Revenue, too, will be lower than executives had forecast: down 85 per cent from the $11.4bn a year earlier, not 83 
per cent.
The cutbacks are part of a pattern in which airlines announce ambitious flying schedules only to trim them as 
departure dates approach and passengers fail to materialise. Industry body Iata said airlines globally were projected 
to lose a record $84bn this year.
Airlines cut flights after passengers fail to return
EasyJet cut its flight schedule earlier this week. Now Ryanair expects to carry 50m passengers in the 12 months to 
the end of March, down from the 60m projected in July. It had forecast more than 150m passengers before the 
pandemic.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the airline might cut more flights in the coming months.
The industry's recovery hopes have been hit hard by rising coronavirus cases across Europe and parts of the US. It 
is pushing for testing on arrival at airports to help cut quarantine times and encourage people back into the sky.
Airlines are also adapting to an environment where business travel has been hit particularly hard by focusing on 
leisure travel and customers flying to see friends and family.
United said it would launch seven new long-haul routes from the US over the next year: two from mainland cities to 
Hawaii, and five connecting diaspora populations to India and Africa.
"We're really focused on rethinking the network," said Patrick Quayle, United's vice-president of international 
network and alliances. "We're not just looking at adding everything back prior to the way it was before coronavirus."

Ryanair steels for winter 'write-off' as travel gloom deepens
Ryanair steels for winter 'write-off' as travel gloom deepens

Ryanair slashed its annual passenger target by another 10 million on Wednesday, becoming the latest European 
airline to signal more capacity cuts as resurgent COVID-19 infections and travel restrictions dent recovery hopes.
"The winter of 2020 will be a write-off," Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary predicted in an interview. 
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier is preparing to close some bases and shrink others, he told Reuters.
Airlines have blamed an uneven patchwork of travel restrictions and quarantine rules across Europe for a stop-go 
recovery that has proven tougher than many expected.
Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet, already cutting 4,500 jobs and closing three UK bases, further reduced its flying 
schedule for the current quarter on Tuesday.
And Wizz Air, which had touted an aggressive push for market share and even a new London Gatwick base, last 
week scaled down operations for the current quarter to 60% of capacity from the previously expected 80%.
Overall, September short-haul schedules have been cut to 43% of European capacity from 47.6% in August, 
Barclays analyst Rishika Savjani said - and that only tells part of the story.
"We think demand is tracking below these levels, and therefore we'd expect weaker load factors and weaker pricing 
for the quarter," Savjani said in a Tuesday note, referring to a key metric for the proportion of aircraft seats filled.
"Pricing is going to be aggressively down" in coming months, the Ryanair boss said. O'Leary was among the first 
CEOs to warn of a virus-induced price war in comments since borne out by a recovering Chinese market, where 
some carriers now offer all-you-can-fly deals.
Ryanair steels for winter 'write-off' as travel gloom deepens
Ryanair now expects to fly 50 million passengers in the fiscal year to March, one-third of the previous year's 
number. The goal was previously cut to 60 million in July from 80 million in May and could go lower still, O'Leary 
cautioned.
"We're probably looking at closing more bases and withdrawing more capacity in those countries where you're 
operating completely defective and non-scientific quarantines," he added - citing Britain, Ireland, Spain and 
Portugal.
Fourteen-day Western European infection rates that have risen to 64.9 per 100,000 from 19.4 in late July are "not 
reflected in share prices," with airline stocks up 14% over the period, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson warned.
Behind the cutback announcements, Ryanair and Wizz remain relatively well positioned over traditional airlines with 
more "exposure to high-risk long-haul markets," Simpson said.
Further setbacks may leave legacy carriers like Air France-KLM and Lufthansa in need of yet more funding on top 
of their multibillion-euro state-backed bailouts, other analysts warn. Air France needs a strong recovery to avoid the 
looming prospect of nationalization.
O'Leary, who last week bolstered Ryanair's already strong balance sheet with a 400 million-euro share issue, 
remains confident the Irish no-frills carrier can come out on top.
"Our rivals have withdrawn huge amounts of capacity," he said. "The competitive landscape if anything is getting 
easier." (Reuters)

Ryanair lands (EURO)4.4bn worth of orders for 5-year bonds Fixed income

Ryanair has become the first big European airline to sell a bond since the start of the pandemic as investors 
shrugged off concerns about tightening travel restrictions in Europe.
The continent's largest low-cost carrier sold (EURO)850m of five-year bonds yesterday at a yield of 3 per cent after 
investors put in (EURO)4.4bn worth of orders. Airlines have been hit hard this year by nationwide shutdowns, travel 
restrictions and social distancing measures imposed by governments to reduce the spread of coronavirus. On 
Monday, the UK government added seven Greek islands to its quarantine list.
Mark Lynagh, co-head of Emea debt markets at BNP Paribas, who worked on the deal, said the bond sale was an 
"opportunistic refinancing exercise", as Ryanair has an (EURO)850m bond due to be paid back next summer.
The deal underlined the hunger for yield from investors after drastic action from central banks this year cut interest 
rates to record lows.
Ryanair's is the first straight bond sale by a European carrier in that environment, but follows an issuance by 
Finnair, which last month raised (EURO)200m of hybrid debt with a 10.25 per cent coupon in late August.
One UK-based fund manager and investor in Ryanair said the Irish airline had "the best-quality balance sheet" 
compared with European peers, with (EURO)3.9bn of cash at the end of June.
The investor added that a long-term decline in business travel did not present a threat to the group.

The carrier has maintained its triple B, investment grade credit rating during the pandemic, unlike rivals such as 
British Airways, which sank further into junk territory yesterday after Moody's downgraded its owner IAG to Ba2. 
The rating agency cited IAG's high exposure to long-haul and corporate travel.
Yesterday's bond sale by Ryanair followed a (EURO)400m raising of equity last week.
"In an environment where it's all about liquidity, they are in a very solid position," said a banker working on the bond 
deal.
Ryanair declined to comment. The airline came under fire this month for paying a (EURO)450,000 bonus to chief 
executive Michael O'Leary despite putting staff on furlough and taking £600m in government aid.
A resurgence of virus cases has led Ryanair to cut flight numbers for autumn. It had hoped to run 70 per cent of its 
normal schedule in September.
"They'll always do well in a recession," said Mr Lynagh, noting that Ryanair had lots of domestic routes that would 
be unaffected by restrictions on international travel.

Ryanair accesses unsecured Eurobond markets again with 850m issue
Ryanair accesses unsecured Eurobond markets again with 850m issue

Highlight: Irish budget airline Ryanair announced that it has issued an 850m Eurobond at a fixed 2.875% for five 
years.
Body
It is the first bond in three years for Ryanair and the second by a European airline since the Covid-19 pandemic, 
reported Reuters. Last month, Finland flag carrier Finnair issued new euro-denominated in aggregate (EURO)200m 
capital securities. 
The bond will be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (Euronext) and offer access to both Europe and the rest of the 
world. Barclays, BNP Paribas and Citigroup served as the joint bookrunners. Ryanair Group CFO Neil Sorahan 
said: "We are pleased to have accessed the unsecured Eurobond markets again. "This (EURO)850m transaction, 
which follows Ryanair's successful (EURO)400m share placing last week, was multiple times oversubscribed and 
was keenly priced at a coupon of 2.875%." The move came a week after Ryanair raised gross proceeds of nearly 
(EURO)400m through a non-pre-emptive placing of new ordinary shares as part of the company's strategy for 
greater financial flexibility to capitalise on significant post-Covid-19 growth opportunities. In a separate 
development, Ryanair has launched a 50% off over 750,000 seats for travel in September and October to various 
destinations across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In May, China Southern Airlines reportedly planned 
to issue up to CNY16bn ($2.25bn) in A-share convertible bonds.

British Airways owner IAG suffered a significant shareholder revolt yesterday over plans to pay outgoing chief 
executive Willie Walsh and other executives large bonuses even as it struggles through the worst crisis in its 
history.
A fifth of voting shareholders voted against IAG's remuneration report, which includes a bonus of £883,000 for Mr 
Walsh for his work in 2019, as part of a total package worth just under £3.2m.
Influential shareholder advisory group ISS had urged investors to vote against the packages at the group's annual 
meeting. IAG executives have since taken pay cuts as part of a costcutting drive.
IAG said it was "disappointed" that just over 20 per cent of shareholders voted against the pay award.
"Aviation has been decimated by the impact of the pandemic, resulting in substantial losses for the global industry. 
It is the worst crisis we have ever faced," Mr Walsh told shareholders on his final day as chief executive. Mr Walsh 
handed over to Luis Gallego yesterday, a company insider who ran Spanish flag carrier Iberia for almost seven 
years.
The Spaniard will have to chart a course through an uncertain winter as Covid-19 cases rise and the company 
downsizes itself to reflect the impact of the pandemic. IAG is also in the process of renegotiating its (EURO)1bn 
deal to buy Air Europa, which it expects to go through in the next six months.
Wings clipped British Airways owner IAG suffers shareholder opposition to pay awards
Investors overwhelmingly backed IAG's (EURO)2.75bn rights issue, helping it to shore up its balance sheet as the 
outlook for the industry remains uncertain.
Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at Goodbody, said the new shareholder funding still left IAG "stretched", while 
rating agency Moody's downgraded the airline's debt just hours before Mr Walsh's swansong as it warned of 
liquidity concerns if there was no meaningful passenger recovery.
Mr Walsh told shareholders not to expect a rapid increase in flights over the coming months, and called on 
governments to introduce Covid-19 testing regimes and to expand travel corridors.
The former pilot, who earned the nickname "slasher Walsh" for his tough stance in two decades of labour 
negotiations, closed his career at IAG under fire from several sides.
But Mr Walsh has won respect from within the industry for his modernisation drive at IAG. Michael O'Leary, chief 
executive of Ryanair, said that Mr Walsh had been "head and shoulders the best airline CEO in the world over the 
past 10 years".

 Ryanair (RYAAY) has trimmed its annual passenger target by another 10 million amid increasing COVID-19 
infections and travel restrictions, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing the major European airline's chief executive.
The Irish no-frills carrier now expects to fly 50 million passengers in the fiscal year to March, the news agency 
reported, citing Michael O'Leary as saying in an interview. The goal was previously slashed to 60 million in July 
from 80 million in May, said O'Leary, who also warned that pricing is going to be aggressively down in the coming 
months.
Ryanair is getting ready to close some bases and shrink others as "the winter of 2020 will be a write-off," Reuters 
reported, quoting O'Leary.
Western European 14-day infections rates have recently risen to 64.9 per 100,000, from 19.4 in late July, according 
to the report.
Shares fell more than 2.5% in pre-bell trading.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) further reduced its fiscal 2021 passenger target to 50 million from 60 million as the COVID-19 
pandemic continues to pummel demand, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary said that if the lockdown restrictions and the slump in demand continue, the passenger numbers could drop 
even further with airlines consequently reducing fares to boost demand, according to the report.
Subsequently, the carrier could close a number of its bases and cut capacity in countries such as the UK, Ireland, 
Spain and Portugal, while increasing capacity in Germany and Italy.
O'Leary added that Ryanair is expected to carry out less than 3,000 redundancies, the report said.
The company's shares fell about 2% on Wednesday morning.

Mile-high bonus club Airline boards [...]
Mile-high bonus club Airline boards [...]

Mile-high bonus club Airline boards have their heads firmly in the clouds, judging from recent recommendations 
from investor advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services.
Wizz Air, International Airlines Group and now Ryanair have attracted ISS's ire over bonuses for bosses in recent 
months. Despite considerable turbulence in the industry, boards at each group have still decided their chief 
executives deserve their bonuses.
Willie Walsh walks away with £883,000, half of it cash, for his final full-year stint in charge of IAG - more than his 
salary. Michael O'Leary pockets 92 per cent of the maximum he could have been awarded at Ryanair, 
(EURO)458,000 in cash. Wizz chief executive József Váradi got a discretionary bonus of (EURO)533,000 in shares, 
despite missing the profit targets that are meant to be the sole determinant of the company's incentive plan.
All have taken advantage of cheap loans from the government's CCFF. All have announced job cuts. Both Ryanair 
and IAG are tapping shareholders for cash too.
Each group has an explanation for why the payouts are more grounded than they appear. The bonuses are for 
financial years that were all but over before Covid came along in the case of Ryanair and Wizz, whose fiscal years 
end in March. Mr Walsh's relates to an even earlier era, the year to December 2019, and the decision to pay it 
made in early March.
Mile-high bonus club Airline boards [...]
The chief executives have taken pay pain along with employees, Mr O'Leary shrinking his salary to a quarter of the 
2019 financial year sum. Mr Váradi had piloted Wizz Air with considerable aplomb before the crisis. He would have 
hit profit targets had the airline not suffered fuel hedge losses linked to Covid-19, something outside his control.
ISS recognises the rationalisations, and reckons payouts miss the mark nonetheless. It is right to recommend 
investors vote against the pay reports. The airline industry is going through an exceptional patch, and executives 
should expect to take an exceptional hit to their pay.
What will be enlightening is how boards react if they lose the nonbinding vote, as Wizz already has. Ryanair only 
scraped through last year; this year's annual meeting takes place next week. Failure to engage with investors' 
concerns will show that boards have still not come fully down to earth.

"considerable" pressure in the next few quarters.
S&P said it expects Ryanair to post a substantial operating cash flow deficit in the fiscal year ending March 31, 
2021, as it anticipates a 60% to 70% plunge in traffic in 2020.

Lauda Europe (Malta Int'l) has received its Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) from Transport Malta, the Director 
General of the authority, Charles Pace, said on September 5. The official register of airlines certified in Malta has 
yet to reflect the event. The new Maltese subsidiary of Ryanair Holdings, which is due to replace Austria-based 
Lauda (OE, Vienna) by the beginning of the Winter 2020/21 season, has already taken delivery of three A320-200s 
transferred from its predecessor, now registered as 9H-LMG (msn 4603), 9H-LMH (msn 5015), and 9H-LMP (msn 
3616). All three Airbus remain parked at Vienna for the time being. Lauda Europe is due to take over all thirty A320-
200s from Lauda, which will be closed once the transfer is completed. The Irish parent said that Maltese labour 
laws allow its subsidiary to operate more flexibly across the whole of Europe in comparison to Austrian rules. Lauda 
Europe will exclusively operate as a capacity provider for Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) and will not fly under its own 
code.

 Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary's proposed 458,000-euro ($542,114) annual bonus during the COVID-19 pandemic, London's Financial 
Times reported Friday.
The move comes after ISS scrutinized International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.L) CEO Willie Walsh's 
sending-off payment of 883,000 pounds sterling ($1.2 million).
British pilots' union BALPA also called the CEO bonuses an insult to staff redundancies or taking pay cuts, the 
report said.
Ryanair's bonus plan is scheduled to be voted on Sept. 17, while IAG's vote is expected to take place Tuesday, the 
report added.
Ryanair rose about 4%, while the British Airways parent increased about 2% at the close of market on Friday.

Wizz Air chief sells down as travel restriction fears grow
Wizz Air chief sells down as travel restriction fears grow

Wizz Air chief executive József Váradi has banked £2.8m after an associated legal entity, Vaxco Holdings, 
disposed of 75,000 shares last week.
The Hungarian airline's disclosure of the disposal preceded news that it had operated at 80 per cent capacity in 
August. Wizz warned, however, that it expects this to drop to 60 per cent for its second financial quarter, as travel 
restrictions return in Europe amid a spike in coronavirus cases in some countries.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has lambasted government measures to restrict border access 
and impose quarantines. "Too many governments are fighting a global pandemic in isolation with a view that 
closing borders is the only solution," said Iata director-general and chief executive Alexandre de Juniac.
Capacity may remain at about 60 per cent for Wizz's third quarter if current travel restrictions persist, the airline 
observed, which is lower than the 80 per cent level it previously expected. Wizz's August load factor, which shows 
the percentage of available seating that is occupied by passengers, sat at 71 per cent, which was just shy of 
Ryanair's August level of 73 per cent.
The airline cautioned that capacity may come down even further and that it may ground part of its fleet as winter 
sets in as it bids to protect its cash levels. Wizz had (EURO)1.59bn (£1.41bn) in cash at the end of June, which was 
only 3 per cent beneath its cash position at the end of June 2019. The self-proclaimed "fastestgrowing European 
airline" added two new UK bases, a host of routes and four new Airbus aircraft last month, taking its fleet to 130 
jets.
Wizz Air chief sells down as travel restriction fears grow
Wizz's latest annual report indicates that Mr Váradi had a stake of 2 per cent in the company in the year ending 31 
March 2020. The airline did not respond to requests for comment.
Trainline chief executive Clare Gilmartin has earned £3.2m from a share disposal, just over a year after the ticketing 
platform listed on the London market. Management was unable to sell down shares for 12 months from the end of 
June 2019, the month Trainline went public.
The shares have been volatile since listing at 350p a share, which valued the company at £1.68bn. They crossed 
the £5 mark at the end of 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic struck, which more than halved their price. But rail 
passenger numbers evaporated in spring, while plans for many employees to work from home for the foreseeable 
future threaten the recovery of train operators and associated businesses such as Trainline.
Trainline's shares have staged a mini-revival since their March collapse, although they sit around a tenth down on 
June levels. Rail passenger numbers have now returned to around a third of normal levels on national rail services.
The government is encouraging workers to return to offices, while new evidence on coronavirus transmission rates 
could help to continue this trend. Research by the Rail Safety and Standards Board published in August found that 
the risk of transmission aboard an Azuma rail carriage is low, at around 1 per 19,765 journeys, if a passenger is 
wearing a mask. Trainline hopes that its app will help persuade passengers back on to trains, some of whom might 
be unwilling to use ticketing machines.
Following her share disposal, Ms Gilmartin's stake has fallen from 1.8 per cent to around 1.6 per cent. Trainline 
shares dropped 6 per cent on 1 September, the day the disposal was announced. The company declined to 
comment on the sale. Alex Janiaud, Investors Chronicle

Trainline's shares have staged a mini-revival since their March collapse, although they sit around a tenth down on 
June levels. Rail passenger numbers have now returned to around a third of normal levels on national rail services.
The government is encouraging workers to return to offices, while new evidence on coronavirus transmission rates 
could help to continue this trend. Research by the Rail Safety and Standards Board published in August found that 
the risk of transmission aboard an Azuma rail carriage is low, at around 1 per 19,765 journeys, if a passenger is 
wearing a mask. Trainline hopes that its app will help persuade passengers back on to trains, some of whom might 
be unwilling to use ticketing machines.
Following her share disposal, Ms Gilmartin's stake has fallen from 1.8 per cent to around 1.6 per cent. Trainline 
shares dropped 6 per cent on 1 September, the day the disposal was announced. The company declined to 
comment on the sale. Alex Janiaud, Investors Chronicle

Wizz Air chief sells down as travel restriction fears grow
Wizz Air chief sells down as travel restriction fears grow

Wizz Air chief executive József Váradi has banked £2.8m after an associated legal entity, Vaxco Holdings, 
disposed of 75,000 shares last week.
The Hungarian airline's disclosure of the disposal preceded news that it had operated at 80 per cent capacity in 
August. Wizz warned, however, that it expects this to drop to 60 per cent for its second financial quarter, as travel 
restrictions return in Europe amid a spike in coronavirus cases in some countries.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has lambasted government measures to restrict border access 
and impose quarantines. "Too many governments are fighting a global pandemic in isolation with a view that 
closing borders is the only solution," said Iata director-general and chief executive Alexandre de Juniac.
Capacity may remain at about 60 per cent for Wizz's third quarter if current travel restrictions persist, the airline 
observed, which is lower than the 80 per cent level it previously expected. Wizz's August load factor, which shows 
the percentage of available seating that is occupied by passengers, sat at 71 per cent, which was just shy of 
Ryanair's August level of 73 per cent.
The airline cautioned that capacity may come down even further and that it may ground part of its fleet as winter 
sets in as it bids to protect its cash levels. Wizz had (EURO)1.59bn (£1.41bn) in cash at the end of June, which was 
only 3 per cent beneath its cash position at the end of June 2019. The self-proclaimed "fastestgrowing European 
airline" added two new UK bases, a host of routes and four new Airbus aircraft last month, taking its fleet to 130 
jets.
Wizz Air chief sells down as travel restriction fears grow
Wizz's latest annual report indicates that Mr Váradi had a stake of 2 per cent in the company in the year ending 31 
March 2020. The airline did not respond to requests for comment.
Trainline chief executive Clare Gilmartin has earned £3.2m from a share disposal, just over a year after the ticketing 
platform listed on the London market. Management was unable to sell down shares for 12 months from the end of 
June 2019, the month Trainline went public.
The shares have been volatile since listing at 350p a share, which valued the company at £1.68bn. They crossed 
the £5 mark at the end of 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic struck, which more than halved their price. But rail 
passenger numbers evaporated in spring, while plans for many employees to work from home for the foreseeable 
future threaten the recovery of train operators and associated businesses such as Trainline.
Trainline's shares have staged a mini-revival since their March collapse, although they sit around a tenth down on 
June levels. Rail passenger numbers have now returned to around a third of normal levels on national rail services.
The government is encouraging workers to return to offices, while new evidence on coronavirus transmission rates 
could help to continue this trend. Research by the Rail Safety and Standards Board published in August found that 
the risk of transmission aboard an Azuma rail carriage is low, at around 1 per 19,765 journeys, if a passenger is 
wearing a mask. Trainline hopes that its app will help persuade passengers back on to trains, some of whom might 
be unwilling to use ticketing machines.
Following her share disposal, Ms Gilmartin's stake has fallen from 1.8 per cent to around 1.6 per cent. Trainline 
shares dropped 6 per cent on 1 September, the day the disposal was announced. The company declined to

Ryanair faces rebel vote over executive pay Airlines

Ryanair is poised for a clash with investors this month after the airline was criticised for paying out a 
(EURO)450,000 bonus to chief executive Michael O'Leary despite furloughing staff and taking government 
pandemic support.
Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential adviser, recommended that investors vote against the company's 
non-binding pay report at Ryanair's annual meeting on September 17.
The world's largest proxy adviser said it was "difficult to justify" the bonus, which was about 92 per cent of the 
maximum Mr O'Leary could have received, given the "upheaval" faced by the sector.
"This payment raises concerns, given the current uncertainties facing the company and the airline industry, and in 
view of the broader stakeholder experience," it said.
Ryanair declined to comment.
ISS's stance is the latest sign that executive bonuses are becoming a flashpoint for investors concerned about how 
companies are reacting to the pandemic. Asset managers such as M&G have warned that some corporate bosses 
are not sharing the pain and are enjoying large payouts, despite businesses furloughing staff and cutting dividends. 
The scrutiny over executive pay comes as European airlines have outlined plans to cut thousands of staff to cope 
with reduced passenger numbers. Industry bodies and executives do not expect a return to pre-pandemic 
passenger numbers until 2024 at the earliest.
Ryanair faces rebel vote over executive pay Airlines
Mr O'Leary's bonus of (EURO)458,000 was for the year up to the end of March 2020. His base pay for 2021 will be 
cut by half to (EURO)250,000.
But ISS said: "The effects of the pandemic were being felt prior to the bonus for [fiscal year] 2020 being finalised 
and there was ample opportunity to reduce or defer the payment in light of the obvious looming challenges facing 
the company."
Ryanair suffered a loss of (EURO)185m in the three months to the end of June as 99 per cent of its flights were 
grounded. "The past quarter was the most challenging in Ryanair's 35-year history," the budget carrier declared 
when it reported the results in July.
It has also used government support under the Job Retention Scheme and drew down £600m under the Covid 
Corporate Financing Facility provided by the Bank of England, ISS said.
Despite criticism from ISS, Glass Lewis, the world's second-largest proxy adviser, recommended shareholders vote 
in favour of the group's pay policy. Pirc, a UK-based proxy adviser, advised shareholders to abstain.
Earlier this week, ISS criticised British Airways owner IAG's decision to award outgoing chief executive Willie Walsh 
a bonus of more than £800,000.

Ryanair launched a share placement on Thursday, aiming to raise 400 million euros to help it take advantage of 
lower costs following the COVID-19 pandemic to expand its fleet and other initiatives.
The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, said the equity raise, via a "non-pre-emptive placing of new 
ordinary shares ... to institutional investors and certain others" would begin immediately via an accelerated 
bookbuild.
Certain directors and members of the senior management team intend to participate in the placing including Group 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, who intends to subscribe broadly pro rata to his current shareholding, Ryanair 
said in its statement.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has hammered air travel, the airline said that it was also likely to "create 
opportunities for Ryanair to grow its network, and expand its fleet, to take advantage of lower airport and aircraft 
cost opportunities that are likely to arise."
Ryanair flew just under half as many passengers in August than in the same month last year, but it has one of the 
strongest balance sheets in the industry with over 3.9 billion euros in cash as of June 30 and unencumbered Boeing 
737 jets worth about 7 billion euros.
"The placing is expected to help better position the group to move quickly to capitalise on such opportunities should 
they arise... (and) should significantly de-risk the group's debt repayments over the next 12 months," the statement 
said.
Ryanair targets €400m in share placement
Rival airline group IAG, which owns British Airways and Ireland's Aer Lingus, in July announced plans to raise 2.75 
billion euros from shareholders.

EU officials green-light 200-million-euro Italian grant for Alitalia
EU officials green-light 200-million-euro Italian grant for Alitalia

The European Commission gave its blessing on Friday to a grant worth just under 200 million euros (236 million 
dollars) from the Italian state for ailing flight company Alitalia to compensate damages arising from the coronavirus.
The measure is in line with the European Union's state aid rules, the bloc's executive arm - which acts as an 
antitrust watchdog - said in a press release.
"The aviation industry is one of the sectors that has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus outbreak," EU 
Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in the statement.
The size of the grant corresponds to losses sustained by the embattled company between March 1 and June 15 
due to Covid-19 restrictions, according to the commission, which added that the measure reflected the 
extraordinary circumstances and was proportionate.
"Our investigations into past support measures to Alitalia are ongoing and we are in contact with Italy on their plans 
and compliance with EU rules," Vestager said.
The commission is already looking into 900 million euros in loans granted by Italy to the company in 2017, and a 
separate loan of 400 million euros from 2019.
State support for hard-hit aviation companies during the pandemic has raised eyebrows among competing firms 
such as Ryanair, but also among environmentalists, who argue polluting industries should not be propped up.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said premarket Friday that it raised EUR400 million ($474.3 million) after placing just 
over 35.2 million shares priced at EUR11.35 apiece.
The Irish-based budget airline said that the placing should significantly de-risk the group's debt repayments over the 
next 12 months.
The company said on Thursday that over the medium-term it will continue to focus on cash preservation and 
generation and the repayment of approximately EUR 1.9 billion of maturing debt.

 Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisor, has recommended investors vote against Ryanair's (RYAAY) 
non-binding pay report at its annual meeting on Sept. 17 that includes a EUR458,000 ($542,000) annual bonus to 
CEO Michael O'Leary, saying that it was "difficult to justify" the payout amid an industry upheaval, the FT reported 
on Friday.
"This payment raises concerns, given the current uncertainties facing the company and the airline industry, and in 
view of the broader stakeholder experience," the report cited ISS as saying. The bonus was for the year up to 
March 2020.
"The effects of the pandemic were being felt prior to the bonus for [fiscal year] 2020 being finalized and there was 
ample opportunity to reduce or defer the payment in light of the obvious looming challenges facing the company."
Ryanair declined to comment, the report said.

Key Reasons for Airline Stocks' Resilience Despite Challenges

Sep 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  It is no longer news that 
the Airline industry remains one of the worst-hit corners of the investing space amid the ongoing coronavirus 
pandemic. However, despite the existing challenges, shares of heavyweights like American Airlines AAL[1], Delta 
Air Lines DAL[2], United Airlines UAL[3], Southwest Airlines LUV[4] and Alaska Air Group ALK[5] have appreciated 
14.7%, 21.2%, 14.9%, 23.3% and 16.5%, respectively, over the past month. The Zacks Airline [6]industry also 
increased 17% in the same time frame.This northward movement in stock prices against the backdrop of 
coronavirus-led adversity is certainly heartening. Let's look at the reasons responsible for this uptrend.Improvement 
in Passenger Demand: Though air-travel demand is still trending way below the year-ago levels, there has been a 
slight recovery in it (particularly in leisure demand). For instance, Southwest Airlines management recently stated 
that there was an improvement in demand for August after a lull in July due to the spike in coronavirus cases in 
certain parts of the United States. 
Booking trends for September also showed a modest uptick.That Americans are slowly taking to the skies again is 
reflected in the surging number of passengers screened by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at 
airports. Notably, TSA screened 807,695 passengers last Sunday[7] (Aug 30), marking a huge increase from the 
April 14 figure when only 87,534 people were screened.This significant growth bodes well as we head for the Labor 
Day holiday weekend. The recent updates on cash burn by some carriers are also encouraging. Evidently, Alaska 
Air expects its cash burn to decline to less than $125 million in August from approximately $175 million in 
July.IATA's Promising July Traffic Report: That the improvement is not only limited to the United States is evident 
from the International Air Transport Association's July traffic report[8]. Per the International Air Transport 
Association, passenger demand in July (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs), though down 79.8% 
year over year, improved from June levels when the year over year decline was 86.6%. This positivity can be 
attributed to the impressive performance by the domestic markets of Russia and China.European carriers including 
the likes of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[9] also witnessed an expansion in July traffic, comparing favorably with the 
June-level owing to easing of restrictions. Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[10]Even though July traffic for the North American 
carriers plunged 94.5% year over year, the same bettered from the 97.1% decline noticed in June.Positive 
Developments on COVID-19 Vaccine: Medical companies across the world are working hard to develop a vaccine 
for the dreaded disease. Favorable vaccine-related updates also contributed to the northbound direction in the 
Key Reasons for Airline Stocks' Resilience Despite Challenges
airline stock prices.Carriers under the aviation industry are hoping that air-travel demand would improve further, 
following more upbeat vaccine-oriented posts. Notably, AstraZeneca recently announced the beginning of a late-
stage study in the United States on its coronavirus vaccine candidate AZD1222, which it is developing in 
partnership with the Oxford University.Airlines Focus on the Upgrade of Safety Measures: In a bid to restore the 
confidence of people in boarding flights, airlines are trying out various ways and means to promote safety. 
Evidently, Delta decided to block the middle seats and limit the number of passengers per flight through at least Jan 
6, 2021.Alaska Airlines decided to make travel almost entirely touch-free in a bid to attract customers. Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[11] also announced multiple safety measures on its flights like the usage of high-efficiency particulate air 
filters that capture 99.97% of particles and filter the surrounding atmosphere of contaminants every three minutes. 
More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple 
sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion 
devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this

investments outside this key trend.

Tech triumph
Questions remain
Aquaa looks at total shareholder returns (TSR) since 1999 for key tech and non-tech indices.
Next up I’m a little uncertain where to draw the line between tech and non-tech. In my experience a great many 
‘legacy’ non-tech businesses are actively building huge tech businesses. Walmart is a huge tech business. The 
sports retailing mammoth the Frasers Group (FRAS), formerly Sports Direct, has an enormously successful online 
business.
Is Easyjet (EZJ) or Ryanair (RYA) a legacy value stock or are they pioneers of internet-enabled travel? Put simply, 
many legacy businesses are now digitising their operations and products like crazy – and making huge amounts of 
money.
Next up my concern – and hope – is that the US and China are about to enter a technology fuelled face-off. China 
might react by stopping inward foreign investment in its technology businesses to safeguard its national interest. 
That could throw a spanner in the whole argument for tech.
Lastly, I also have my deep suspicions around tech profitability and margins, best explained by a small example. I 
have a few cloud-based services which seem to become ever more expensive. Like many consumers with endless 
online subscriptions I have noticed that tech inflation – sure you get more product but you pay more for the 
experience – has become a real challenge.
That’s wonderful for the margins of the tech businesses but as they become large parts of consumer expenditure, 
and tech service inflation becomes more noticeable, I’d expect to see real pushback on those massively profitably 
margins.
David Stevenson: tech is the new ‘value’ but won’t grow forever
SG strategist Albert Edwards has made a much broader point that backs up this narrow example. In a paper from 
earlier in the summer, Edwards reminded investors that back in 1999 and 2000 investors were equally convinced 
that ever higher tech share prices would be backed up by ever higher tech earnings.
Then a recession hit and within 12 to 18 months those supposedly defensive tech earnings started to crumble and 
fade. Tech turned out to be ever so slightly more cyclical than everyone had expected. As a consequence, 
valuations started to crumble, and the tech sector wilted and waned for a number of years.

For the third time this year RAF jet interceptors were sent into the air, for something that they could do nothing 
whatsoever about, namely an "incident" aboard a Ryanair flight to Stansted at the end of last month.
The Ministry of Defence may just as well have launched a submarine or ordered all employees whose name began 
with "R" to dance on one leg singing "Old Mother Hubbard" in Cantonese, as equally effective measures, the latter

In this era of chronic defence cuts, this asinine behaviour has to be answered for.

Sep 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted disappointing traffic numbers for August, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from 
the COVID-19 pandemic. This Ireland-based carrier reported a 53% year-over-year plunge in August traffic to 
merely 7 million guests.Ryanair operated approximately 60% of the normal August schedule with a load factor (% of 
seats filled with passengers) of 73%. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion 
unit) declined 40% to 88.9 million.Apart from the traffic results, Ryanair was in news recently when it announced 
that it will be cutting capacity by 20%[2] for September and October due to a drop in bookings lately as coronavirus 
cases in some European Union countries increase. The cuts will be focused on countries where the spurt in 
COVID-19 cases resulted in increased travel restrictions by the UK and Ireland.Per a Reuters [3]report, Ryanair will 
trim its workforce less than the original estimate of 3,000. This favorable development followed the decision taken 
by 97% of its pilots and more than 90% of its cabin crew to accept pay cuts as the coronavirus continues to ravage 
the aviation industry by shrinking air-travel demand significantly. 
Zacks Rank &#38; Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks 
in the Zacks Transportation [4]sector are Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. KNX[5] , United Parcel Service, 
Inc. UPS[6] and Werner Enterprises, Inc. WERN[7] . Knight-Swift sports a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy), while UPS 
and Werner carry a Zacks Rank #2(Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here.[8]Long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Knight-Swift, UPS and Werner 
is pegged at 15%, 7.7% and 8.5%, respectively. Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation Be among the early 
investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. 
Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it's expected to create 
22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout 
accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks' just-

       U.K. stocks rose sharply on Wednesday, with sentiment boosted by solid manufacturing indicators from the 
United States and elsewhere as well as hopes for progress in talks on additional U.S. fiscal stimulus. 
 The benchmark FTSE 100 jumped 103 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,964 after losing as much as 1.7 percent on 
Tuesday. 
 Barratt Developments shares surged 6.7 percent. After posting weak annual results, the U.K.'s largest 
housebuilder said it was seeing green shoots of recovery in the housing market.
 Low-cost airline Wizz Air Holdings declined 1.7 percent after its passenger traffic in the month of August fell 41 
percent to 2.38 million booked passengers from last year's 4.04 million.
 AstraZeneca gained 1.3 percent on news it has begun a large-scale human trial of its coronavirus vaccine in the 
U.S.
 Ryanair Holdings edged down slightly after unveiling August Group traffic figures. 
 Shares of Computacenter soared 10.6 percent. The technology company said its successful trading performance 
seen in the first half of the year has continued for the first two months of the second half.
 In economic releases, U.K. house prices increased the most since early 2004 as the property market showed signs 
of recovery following the easing of lockdown restrictions, data from Nationwide Building Society showed.
 House prices advanced by more-than-expected 2 percent on month in August, faster than the 1.8 percent rise seen 
in the previous month.
 This was also the fastest growth since February 2004. Economists had forecast a monthly increase of 0.5 percent.
FTSE 100 Rises On Economic Recovery Optimism

 Separately, U.K. shop prices declined at a faster pace in August, data from the British Retail Consortium revealed. 
Shop prices fell 1.6 percent from last year, following a 1.3 percent drop in July.
 The fall was largely driven by a 3.4 percent decrease in non-food prices. At the same time, food inflation slowed to 
1.3 percent.

Ryanair flew 7 million passengers last month, up 59% on July as it returned to a more regular schedule but still less 
than half the number it flew a year earlier before the COVID-19 pandemic hit air travel.
Traffic was down 53% year on year after Europe's biggest budget carrier operated around 60% of its normal August 
schedule.
It recorded a 73% load factor, which measures how well an airline fills available seats, similar to the level in July.
The Irish airline last month decided to reduce its flight capacity by a further 20% in September and October after a 
reimposition of some travel restrictions led to a weakness in forward bookings, particularly among business 
travellers. (Reuters)

Body
Ryanair has placed about 35.2 million new ordinary shares at (EURO)11.35 ($13.46) per share, a discount of 2.6% 
on the company's closing price on 3 September.
The low-cost carrier wants to use the proceeds to capitalise on post-Covid-19 growth opportunities as other carriers 
fail or merge due to the crisis and to "de-risk" its debt repayments.
It is also looking to retain its BBB investment grade rating to "optimise" planned bond issuances in the near future, 
and expects the share placement to "further enhance" its liquidity position, which included (EURO)3.9 billion of cash 
on 30 June 2020.
The company has approximately (EURO)1.9 billion of debt maturing from March to June 2021, when it also plans to 
start receiving Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft - potentially up to 40 units before the summer season.
"Prudent capital management through the Placing and the expected bond issuance will pre-fund the Group's 
balance sheet and enhance its financial flexibility as it continues to face a very challenging and uncertain 
operational environment," stated Ryanair.
The new shares represent approximately 3.2% of Ryanair's issued share capital immediately prior to the placing.
The (EURO)400 million share issue was placed by J&E Davy, which acted as sole bookrunner, and applications 
have been made for the admission of the new shares on Euronext Dublin as their primary listing and on the London 
Stock Exchange.
Settlement of the placing shares is expected to occur on 8 September.
Institutional investors, including new and existing shareholders, participated in the placement, as did certain of 
Ryanair's directors and management.

Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) has announced in a statement to Reuters that it would cut its network from Hungary to just 
32 weekly departures as of September 7, 2020, after the government announced the closure of the country to 
nearly all foreigners. The airline said that it would continue operating the most popular routes out of Hungary but 
that most of its services would be suspended between September 7 and 30. According to the ch-aviation schedules 
module, Wizz Air scheduled 358 departures out of Hungary in the week starting August 30, 2020, with a total of 
74,880 departure seats. The low-cost carrier serves Budapest and Debrecen in the country, operating international 
routes exclusively. 
Hungary is currently Wizz Air's fifth-largest origin market, after Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, and Italy, 
with a 7.6% market share by departure capacity. Wizz Air is also by far the largest airline in Hungary at this time 
with a 59.9% market share by capacity. Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), the second-ranked carrier, controls 18.8%. As of 
September 1, Hungary's borders will be closed to nearly all foreigners, except for a limited number of exceptions 
including essential workers and expatriates travelling on business involving Hungarian firms. All Hungarians 
returning home, regardless of their country of embarcation, will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine and test twice 
for COVID-19, all of which must be paid out of their own pockets.

Irish carrier Ryanair has filed a new base prospectus for a (EURO)5 billion ($5.9 billion) medium-term note (EMTN) 
programme, but is yet to issue the unsecured bonds.
Citigroup Global Markets is the global coordinator of the programme.
BNP Paribas and Citigroup Global Markets are arrangers while 15 banks are acting as dealers in the programme. 
Those include Barclays Bank Ireland, Barclays Bank, BNP Paribas, Citigroup Global Markets Europe, Citigroup 
Global Markets, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Goldman 
Sachs International, ING Bank, J&E Davy, Natwest Markets, SMBC Nikko Capital Markets, SMBC Nikko Capital 
Markets Europe, Societe Generale and Standard Chartered Bank.   The Irish low-cost carrier established the EMTN 
programme last August and at the time S&P Global Ratings Europe and Fitch Ratings assigned BBB+ ratings.   In 
the new base prospectus, both agencies have assigned a BBB rating.
Ryanair last tapped the bond markets in early 2017 as part of its (EURO)3 billion EMTN programme.
The 6.5-year transaction priced at a fixed coupon of 1.125%. The joint bookrunners were BNP Paribas, Citigroup 
and Credit Agricole.
In March 2015, Ryanair issued an (EURO)850 million eight-year bond at 1.125%, at mid-swaps plus 67 basis points 
- setting a new record for the aviation industry.

Ryanair could seek to take advantage of the current "market softness" to make a Boeing 737 Max order 
announcement, analysts at Davy have suggested.
Speaking to Airfinance Journal, Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said he expects the low-cost carrier to confirm 75 
Max options and reconfirm its existing 135 committed orders for a total of 210 orders.
"Basically a repricing of the existing deal and a new delivery schedule given delays," he comments.
Furlong and Davy analyst Ross Harvey state in a research note their belief that "lowest cost wins" and believe the 
ultra-low-cost-carrier (ULCC) models are the "structural leaders".
With the intra-European market contracting over the coming years, they expect Ryanair to grow into the "vacuum" 
this creates with lower airport costs, some staff savings and lower ownership, maintenance and rental costs.
Key to growth to 200 million passengers per annum over the next five or six years will be the 210 737 Max aircraft 
on order or allocated as options, with Ryanair having estimated that it will take delivery of 40 Max aircraft for service 
next summer.
Furlong and Harvey also note that Ryanair has reached agreement with most pilot and cabin crew unions.
They expect a "smaller, more concentrated" industry post-crisis with certain airlines such as Ryanair, and Wizz Air 
having gained market share.
Furlong and Harvey note that at the end of the SARS crisis, temperature screening was a "key factor" in returning 
the sector to normal.
"The industry needs to find the equivalent process to take us to when a Covid-19 vaccine is available - the goal we 
should have is an effective set of standard practices that can be implemented globally as required," they add.

Two men have been released without charge following a security scare after a mobile phone was found in an 
airplane toilet, British police said on Monday.
The two - a 34-year-old Kuwaiti national and a 48-year-old Italian - were arrested after their arrival on Sunday on a 
Ryanair flight from Vienna at London's Stansted airport.
They were initially arrested on suspicion of terrorism.
The suspicious object that triggered the scare was a mobile phone, the Press Association news agency reported.
"We understandably take any reports of suspicious objects or behaviour on flights very seriously and thankfully on 
this occasion there was no cause for concern," said Andy Waldie of the Counter Terrorism Policing unit, PA 
reported.
Two RAF Typhoon jet fighters were scrambled to intercept the passenger jet.
A Ryanair spokesman had earlier said the flight crew had been alerted to a "potential security threat on board."

Under the hood Uncertainty takes toll as airlines suffer their worst crisis; 
The prospect of second virus waves and a patchwork of state curbs are

Airlines are in their worst crisis since the first commercial service began just over 100 years ago.
In the past week alone, American said it would cut 19,000 jobs, Qantas announced it would shed thousands more 
jobs, and Norwegian warned it needed another rescue package.
The prospect of second virus waves and state curbs are crippling airlines' ability to forecast demand - jarring for a 
sector that requires reliable projections.
"You are getting airlines going from zero to 70 per cent capacity in the blink of an eye then having to ramp back 
down," said Mark Manduca, analyst at Citi.
Domestic passenger numbers in some markets have slowly started to recover from lockdown lows, especially in 
Asia. Air travel in China has fully returned to its pre-Covid levels. Japan has resumed normal service. Domestic 
travel is not subject to the same level of curbs, leaving it well positioned to lead any recovery.
Yet international travel remains adrift. The US has scheduled only a fifth of the seats used at the start of the year, 
while Vietnam - after a fresh outbreak - has cut capacity 90 per cent.
Europe's airlines have the challenge of navigating a patchwork of state rules, including quarantine restrictions.

Norwegian Air Shuttle Calls for More Government Financial Support to Survive Impact of COVID-19 on Global

Norwegian Air Shuttle Calls for More Government Financial Support to 
Survive Impact of COVID-19 on Global Aviation Industry

 Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS.OL), a low-cost carrier, said on Friday that it reported a wider loss in the first half and 
called for more financial support from the state to help get it through the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on the aviation industry.  
The company is facing "challenging times ahead" and the 3 billion Norwegian kroner ($341 million) support that it 
received earlier this year in the form of guaranteed loans "is not enough to get through this prolonged crisis," 
Norway's flagship carrier said in its earnings statement.
The group reported a net operating loss of 5.08 billion Norwegian kroner versus a loss of 836 million a year ago as 
a slump in the number of passengers flown pushed sales lower to 7.14 billion Norwegian kroner from 20.17 billion 
Norwegian kroner a year earlier. Most firms needed support to survive amid the hit to travel and tourism and have 
received "considerable" liquidity from their respective governments, it said.
"We are thankful for the loan guarantee made available to us by the Norwegian government which we worked hard 
to obtain," Chief Executive Jacob Schram said. "However, given the current market conditions, it is not enough to 
get through this prolonged crisis."
Norwegian reopened 76 routes on July 1, putting an additional 15 aircraft into service and bringing back more than 
600 staff to work. That compares with the grounding of 140 aircraft and furloughing or laying off about 8,000 
employees at the height of the crisis when strict government advice on travel decimated demand. In the second 
quarter, Norwegian operated seven to eight aircraft on domestic routes.
The firm said a high degree of uncertainty it is seeing in the market was mainly the result of "changing travel advice 
from governments across Europe," which in turn has an immediate impact on demand.
Norwegian Air Shuttle Calls for More Government Financial Support to Survive Impact of COVID-19 on Global 
Aviation Industry
The UK's Department of Transport and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement on Thursday that 
Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica have been removed from its list of travel corridors for England as 
data showed a "significant increase" in confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Ireland's Ryanair (RYAAY), the biggest European budget airline said earlier this year coronavirus crisis has sparked 
a multi-billion "flood" of state aid from European Union governments to their flag carriers and called on the German 
government to "scrap" 9 billion euros ($10.64 billion) of financial support to Lufthansa.

Aug 28, 2020( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Trump says Biden is 'destroyer of 
American greatness' Donald Trump has warned that Joe Biden will 'demolish' the American dream if he wins the 
White House. Speaking on the final night of the Republican convention, the US president depicted his challenger as 
'the destroyer of American greatness' and claimed the Democrats would give free rein to 'violent anarchists'. The 
election campaign is 'widely expected to be one of the ugliest in living memory', says the BBC.   Care homes' death 
tolls hidden 'for commercial reasons' Coronavirus death tolls at individual care homes are being kept secret by 
regulators to protect providers' commercial interests before a possible second wave, reports The Guardian. 
England's Care Quality Commission and the Care Inspectorate in Scotland are refusing to disclose which homes or 
providers recorded the most fatalities because they fear that the supply of beds and standards of care could be 
threatened if customers deserted badly hit operators.   Conservatives tell Boris to get Britain back to workplaces 
Boris Johnson is under pressure from senior Tory MPs to give a 'clear and consistent message' that it is safe for 
people to go back to work. There have been warnings of 'devastating consequences' for town and city centres as 
analysis of mobile phone data shows that just 17% of workers have returned to their offices, no more than at the 
end of June.   Hurricane Laura downgraded after killing six in Louisiana Six people have died afterHurricane Laura 
hitLouisiana, felling trees and damaging buildings. The Category 4 storm arrived yesterday morning near the Texas 
border, tearing off roofs and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands. However, the expected 20ft (6m) storm 
surge was avoided and Laura has now been downgraded to tropical storm status.   BMJ says Covid risk to 
schoolchildren is 'tiny' The British Medical Journal says parents should be 'reassured' that Covid-19 has not caused 
the deaths of any otherwise healthy children in the UK. Researchers looked at 651 children with coronavirus in 
hospitals and found that children's risk of needing hospital treatment for coronavirus is 'tiny' and critical care 'even 
tinier'. The news comes as English schoolsprepare to open next week.   Staff in hazmat suits rush Covid passenger 
off Ryanair flight Officials in full PPE swept on board a Ryanair flight moments before it departed from London to 
remove a passenger who had tested positive for Covid-19. The passenger had received a text from test and trace 
minutes before departure, informing him that he had the virus. Ryanair said: 'The passenger and his travel 
companion were immediately offloaded and taken to a Stansted airport isolation area.'   Banksy finances boat to 
rescue refugees in the Mediterranean The street artist Banksy has funded a boat to rescue refugees attempting to 
reach Europe from north Africa. Named Louise Michel after a French feminist anarchist, the boat set off on 18 
August from the Spanish seaport of Burriana, near Valencia, and is now in the central Mediterranean. It has so far 
Ten Things You Need to Know Today: Friday 28 Aug 2020
rescued 89 people in distress, including 14 women and four children.   British children 'the least happy in Europe' 
Researchers have blamed a 'particularly British fear of failure' for their finding that more than a third of 15-year-olds 
here have low scores for life satisfaction, making them the unhappiest in Europe. The annual Good Childhood 
Report found that UK children were dissatisfied with schools, friends and their sense of purpose.   Harry Maguire 
says he thought he was being kidnapped The footballer Harry Maguire said he feared for his life when Greek police 
arrested him last week because he thought he was being kidnapped. Speaking to the BBC, the Manchester United 
and England defender claimed that plain-clothed police officers, who did not identify themselves, pulled over his 
group's minibus in Mykonos, threw him off the bus and struck him on his legs.   Conservationist killed by lions he 
hand-reared A 69-year-old South African conservationist has been killed by the lions he raised. West Mathewson 
was walking two white lionesses when one of the animals attacked and killed him without warning at the Lion Tree 
Top Lodge, in northern Limpopo province. Mathewson, known as 'Uncle West', had reare the lions from cubs.

Lauda Europe (Malta Int'l) has scheduled its launch for September 13, 2020, with its inaugural flight tentatively 
planned from Palma de Mallorca to Memmingen, analysis of parent Ryanair's internet booking engine shows. 
Ryanair Holdings' new Maltese subsidiary is due to replace Lauda (OE, Vienna), which is slated for closure. Lauda 
Europe will take over the operation of A320-200s from Lauda and will exclusively operate as a technical wet-lease 
operator under Ryanair's "FR" code. As of August 26, 2020, Lauda Europe has yet to receive its Maltese Air 
Operator's Certificate. As such, none of Lauda's aircraft have been transferred to the Maltese register so far. The 
Austrian airline, the sole Airbus operator within Ryanair Holdings, currently has a fleet of thirty A320-200s and has 
no plans to increase it beyond this number in the near term. Ryanair declined to confirm that Lauda Europe would 
launch on September 13. In a statement to ch-aviation, the LCC only relayed its earlier press release saying that 
Lauda Europe would be operational by the start of the winter 2021/22 season.

Having struck deals with unions representing pilots and cabin crew across Europe, Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) now 
expects to cut "significantly" fewer jobs than the 3,000 it originally estimated, its director of operations Neal 
McMahon has told Reuters. Overall, he said during an interview on August 21, 97% of pilots and more than 90% of 
cabin crew have so far agreed to take pay cuts and changes to employment terms. At the beginning of May, the 
airline warned it may have to institute cost cuts that could result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin 
crew jobs - one in five of its flight crew personnel - if they did not accept wage reductions of up to 20%. But on 
August 20, Spanish pilots accepted a 20% pay cut and work practice changes. 
Although cabin crew there refused to join the pilots in the agreement, the collective bargaining system in Spain 
allows Ryanair to implement the changes anyway. That leaves agreements outstanding with cabin crew in both Italy 
and Germany and pilots in Belgium. "We haven't finalised the number yet. We originally said there was going to be 
3,000 redundancies, but we have been able to reduce that significantly," McMahon told Reuters. "Broadly speaking, 
they recognise the grim situation we are in and they have been pragmatic." According to Ryanair's human 
resources director Darrell Hughes, the cabin crew union in Italy has put a deal to a vote, negotiations with flight 
attendants continue in Germany, and discussions on a collective redundancy process for pilots in Belgium are 
ongoing. Ryanair has, so far, managed to sustain pilot numbers without redundancies by deploying a mix of 
voluntary part-time work, voluntary unpaid leave, and spreading shifts more widely, McMahon and Hughes said.

bitcoin currently costs around 8,000, but if you ask Michael O'Leary, it's dramatically overvalued.The Ryanair chief 
executive has voiced his disapproval of bitcoin, which he likens to a ponzi scheme, and expressed the belief that 
the cryptocurrency is an unsound investment. O'Leary's comments[1] come in the wake of a crypto scam called 
Bitcoin Lifestyle that used a fake endorsement by him to promote the fraud. 
Despite Bitcoin Lifestyle having no connection with bitcoin (BTC) or with O'Leary, it hasn't stopped Ryanair's senior 
exec from taking aim at bitcoin and everything it represents. As anyone who's checked the BTC price chart[2] lately 
will attest, however, bitcoin holds significant value to the millions of people who use it as a store of value, means of 
cross-border exchange, pseudonymous currency, and speculative asset. Bitcoin is up 60% for the year to date and 
many analysts are predicting it to reach new all-time highs within the next 12 months.O'Leary Wouldn't Invest a 
Cent in BitcoinRiled by his likeness being used to flog a knock-off version of bitcoin, O'Leary has vowed 'I have 
never, and would never, invest one cent in Bitcoin, which I believe is equivalent to a Ponzi scheme I would strongly 
advise everyone with any shred of common sense to ignore this false story and avoid Bitcoin like a plague.' 
Ryanair's CEO is one of Ireland's richest men[3] and an entrepreneur whose business acumen speaks for itself. At 
59, however, he is significantly older than the average bitcoin enthusiast, and can be forgiven for failing to 
understand its value proposition. Unfortunately, the first interaction that many British public figures including Michael 
O'Leary, Simon Cowell, Sir Philip Green, Holly Willoughby, Lord Sugar, and Jeremy Clarkson have with bitcoin is 
discovering they've been used to promote crypto scams they have supposedly endorsed and profited from. With a 
net worth of 800 million, O'Leary has no need for speculating in highly volatile crypto assets. He's already made it, 
and thus can afford to be dismissive of bitcoin. He's certainly not the only HNW individual to have written off bitcoin 
out of hand. Billionaire Warren Buffett memorably called[4] bitcoin 'rat poison squared' and his stance on 
cryptocurrencies doesn't appear to have softened, even after attending a charity lunch with several crypto 
influencers including Justin Sun, the founder of the TRON blockchain and cryptocurrency.Where There's Money, 
There's ScammersWhy bitcoin is not, in any classic sense, a ponzi scheme, its meteoric rise in value over the past 
decade has attracted scammers. From Twitter giveaway scams, like the one that saw celebrity accounts 
commandeered by a teenage hacker, to fake news sites promoting Bitcoin Lifestyle with the 'endorsement' of 
Michael O'Leary, scammers have been lured to bitcoin like bees to honey. While their efforts have served to taint 
Bitcoin is worth 8,000 but Ryanair 's CEO believes it should be worth zero
bitcoin's name, they haven't diminished the function it was designed for, and which it still faithfully serves: 
uncensorable digital cash for the digital generation. Read more: Bitcoin is worth 8,000 but Ryanair's CEO believes it

Ryanair and the Spanish Union of Airline Pilots (SEPLA) have agreed on a 20% pay reduction restored over four 
years along with productivity improvements on rosters, flexible working patterns and annual leave to minimise 
Spanish Pilot job losses.
This agreement gives Ryanair a framework to flex its operation during the COVID-19 crisis and a pathway to 
recovery when the business returns to normal in the years ahead.
"We welcome today's result that an overwhelming majority (80%) of SEPLA members voted in favour of a four-year 
agreement on 20% pay cuts and productivity improvements on rosters and flexible working patterns to save the 
maximum number of Spanish Pilot jobs," said Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson.

Aug 24, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a Reuters report[1], 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] will trim its workforce less than the original estimate of 
3,000. This favorable development followed the decision of 97% of its pilots and more than 90% of its cabin crew to 
accept pay cuts as the coronavirus continues to ravage the airline by reducing air-travel demand 
significantly.Notably, management had already warned of taking a stern action by removing one in five of its pilots 
and the cabin crew if they disagree to take lower remuneration by up to 20% under the current scenario. 
Recognizing the gravity of this situation, most pilots and the cabin staff have so far signed deals pertaining to salary 
cuts and work practice changes.In his reaction, Ryanair's director of operations, Neal McMahon said: "We haven't 
finalised the number yet, we originally said there was going to be 3,000 redundancies but we have been able to 
reduce that significantly.'The actual extent of job cuts at the currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Ryanair, however, 
depends on the booking scenario for the upcoming season apart from the degree to which the ongoing global 
health peril disrupts air travel in 2021. Other European carriers like easyJet also cautioned against of job losses as 
air-travel continues to be adversely impacted by the pandemic crisis. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3].Moving across to the United 
States, the financial aid under the CARES act protects jobs at the airlines only through Sep 30, 2020. However, 
many U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines DAL[4], American Airlines AAL[5] and United Airlines UAL[6] alerted 
employees to the possibilities of lay-offs post the above date as the companies are grappled with the problem of 
overstaffing due to depressed revenues. Just Released: Zacks' 7 Best Stocks for Today Experts extracted 7 stocks 
from the list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning 
average gain of +24.3% per year.These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate

Aug 24, 2020( IMD MBA Blog: https://blogs.imd.org/ Delivered by Newstex)  3 lessons from my MBA - IMD MBA 
Blog          We use cookies to offer you the best user experience when accessing our Online Platforms. By your 
continued access, you accept such cookies as well as our Privacy Notice[1] and Cookie Policy[2].    Three key 
learnings from the first 8 months of my MBA: trade-offs, moral compass and respect for opinions.  Disclaimer: all 
photos are taken in pre-COVID time.As we approach the intense job search phase, combined with International 
Consulting Projects, in some ways it feels like the best times of the program are over. 
Together we have all gone through the intense Module 1 and the Module 2 confinement due to COVID. There was 
lots of fun in-and outside of the school. Now, the summer is coming to an end and the focus switches away from 
auditorium activities to more practical, group and individual challenges. As the time flies, I wanted to reflect on my 
key learnings from the MBA program so far.IMD offers a highly comprehensive academic curriculum that includes 
mandatory business disciplines such as Strategy, Accounting, Finance, Economics, Marketing, etc. These classes 
ensure a solid base for solving business problems. However, I do not believe this knowledge helps us to become a 
happier person or a visionary leader, that comes from the other important component of the program - personal 
development.I chose IMD exactly because of this, and I wasn't disappointed. I wanted to know myself better, learn 
to communicate and connect with people better and become more confident. I got all of it. Team CUTS who helped 
me understand myself and others better Here's a selection of 3 key personal takeaways from the program so 
far:1.The theory of trade-offs This concept was introduced for the first time during the Strategy class of Misiek 
Piskorski[3]. Companies make choices that entail a combination of integrated consequences which make other 
choices unavailable. For example, Ryanair does not provide food on board to shorten the time required to clean-up 
the plane after flights. The same applies in our personal lives. MBA participants with families have three key 
activities: studies, family and social time with classmates, but they generally can't have all three of them in full, 
thereby they have to make trade-offs and balance daily.  Misiek Piskorski, Professor of Strategy, gathers curious 
MBAs after class Banal as it may seem, this concept, experienced firsthand got stuck deeply in my head.2.Moral 
compass I picked this idea up from Ralf Boscheck[4], IMD Professor of Economics, when we discussed 
transactional costs. Due to lack of trust, companies spend enormous amounts of money on lawyers to ensure the 
interests of the counterparts are secured. But even that doesn't always guarantee the deal will be beneficial for 
everyone. The solution is to deal with people and organizations that share the same values. Again, seems obvious, 
but eventually it made me ask about the guiding principles of people around me and discuss moral dilemmas - the 
3 lessons from my MBA
best way to understand and find 'your' people. Ralf Boscheck, Professor of Economics, having fun listening to MBA 
presentations  3.Stand up for you opinion but accept that of others I learned this lesson with my start-up group. In 
teamwork it's not about who gets to be right or wrong, as long as each team member has a chance to express 
themself and be heard. Eventually, it is the active presence and contribution that counts, not the winning or losing of 
arguments.Those are my top-3 ideas. And what are yours?Dmitry[5]      If you want to keep reading        Yaroslav 
uses his summer break to reunite with his daughter in Russia and bring her back to Switzerland.         The first half 
of the MBA is now over and we can start preparing for what is yet to come.         Finance in the Summer can be 
spicy and sparkling.         A journey of reflection on self-awareness and leadership by lac Lman.         The final MBA 
application tip of the month. Avoid the stress of last minute problems. Set aside some time in advance, check your 
application, and submit.         The latest Application tips focus more on the essay and interview and the need to tell 
a 
story 
that 
makes 
you 
unique 
and 
compelling.

Ryanair CEO Says Bitcoin Is A Ponzi Scheme After New Scam Emerged
Ryanair CEO Says Bitcoin Is A Ponzi Scheme After New Scam Emerged

Aug 23, 2020( DC Forecasts: https://www.dcforecasts.com Delivered by Newstex)  The Ryanair CEO said Bitcoin is 
a Ponzi Scheme after a fraudulent BTC scam that uses fake celebrity success stories encouraging people to take 
part in their money and he was also used in this scam so let's find out more in today's BTC news[1]. Scammers 
used the likeness of the Ryanair CEO as being the leader of a budget airline to promote a fraudulent Bitcoin auto-
trading site. However, he hates bitcoin and urges people to avoid it like the plague. The CEO is the latest celebrity 
whose likeness has been used to promote a Fake BTC-auto trading scheme similar to the ones that exploited stars 
such as Kate Winslet or Sir Alan Sugar. 
When he found out he was involved, Michael O'Leary said[2] that he has nothing to do with the scam and the 
Bitcoin itself is a scam equivalent to a Ponzi Scheme.The fake ad which was hosted on multiple high profile 
websites, links to a fake interview about Bitcoin between O'Leary and Ryan Tubridy, where he actually never said 
the following: 'I'm glad I tried [Bitcoin] because it was some of the biggest and easiest money I have ever made. I'm 
talking tens of thousands of euro[s] a day on autopilot.'The fake interview claims that O'Leary made the money from 
the Bitcoin Lifestyle which is an auto-trading bot and that his bank National Ireland[3] Bank will reach O'Leary to 
stop him from spreading the secret. This sounds too good to be true because O'Leary never had anything to do with 
the scheme and the National Ireland Bank also doesn't exist. O'Leary is the latest go get caught up in a fake Bitcoin 
money-making scheme. The rule is the same, find a celebrity, encourage the people to invest in the machine and 
then shut down the project and run away. The celebrities always distance themselves as Kate Winslet reminded her 
fans that she is not a fan of bitcoin and that it was a 'misleading promotion that is disingenuous and categorically 
false.' O'Leary played things differently. He used the opportunity to say that he hates Bitcoin: 'I have never, and 
would never, invest one cent in bitcoin, which I believe is equivalent to a Ponzi scheme,' he began. 'I would strongly 
advise everyone with any shred of common sense to ignore this false story and avoid bitcoin like a plague.' [ 1]:

European economic rebound slows as virus cases rise

LONDON (AP) — The European economy's rebound from the coronavirus recession appears to have slowed in 
August as a resurgence in new confirmed contagions across the region makes businesses, shoppers and travelers 
more cautious.
An indicator of business activity published Friday by research firm IHS Markit fell back to a level that suggests the 
economy is barely growing after a relatively strong burst in July, when many countries had phased out the 
restrictions on public life that were imposed in the spring to contain the pandemic.
Coronavirus contagions are rising rapidly in many European countries, even if deaths remain at a relatively low 
level. That has made some consumers more cautious. Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said this week it was 
cutting back further on the number of flights as demand remains low.
That suggests the European economy, which had been expected to bounce back from recession more forcefully 
than the United States, could take longer to heal.
“The path taken will likely depend in large part on how successfully COVID-19 can be suppressed and whether 
companies and their customers alike can gain the confidence necessary to support growth,” said Andrew Harker, 
economics director at IHS Markit.
The so-called purchasing managers' index, which is based on a survey of 5,000 companies across the 19-country 
eurozone, dropped to 51.6 points in August from 54.9 in July. The 50-mark separates economic contraction from 
growth.
The survey found that companies are cutting jobs for a sixth consecutive month, though not by as much as in April, 
with layoffs biggest in the manufacturing sector.
A significant weakening in European business would be a blow to the global economy as the region had been one 
of the most successful in getting the pandemic under control. The European economy is forecast to recover more 
European economic rebound slows as virus cases rise
rapidly from recession than the United States, which hasn't yet managed to significantly reduce its first wave of 
contagions.
The eurozone economy shrank by a devastating 12.1% in the April-June period from the previous quarter but other 
indicators have pointed to a return to growth — from retail sales to manufacturing. The unemployment rate has held 
steady thanks to massive aid from governments to keep redundant workers on company payrolls. Some of that aid 
will phase out or be reduced in coming months, meaning job losses are likely to pile up.
Florian Hense, economist at Berenberg Bank, expects there to not be a repeat of the severe first wave of 
contagions and restrictions on business. But the uncertainty means the economy will take time to regain strength 
and won't get back quickly to where it was before the pandemic.
“Governments should seriously consider to prolong, or at least phase out only slowly, furlough schemes that end 
this autumn,” Hense said. “Otherwise the hit to employment and income could trigger a double-dip recession.”

Ryanair to cut significantly fewer jobs after pay deals

Ryanair plans to cut significantly fewer jobs than the 3,000 it originally estimated, after 97% of pilots and over 90% 
of cabin crew have signed up so far to pay cuts and work practice changes, its director of operations said on Friday.
Europe's biggest budget airline had warned it would have to cut one in five of its pilots and cabin crew if they did not 
agree to pay cuts of up to 20% after the COVID-19 crisis ravaged its business.
The Irish airline struck a pay deal with Spanish pilots on Thursday, leaving agreements outstanding with pilots in 
Belgium and cabin crew in Italy and Germany.
"We haven't finalised the number yet, we originally said there was going to be 3,000 redundancies but we have 
been able to reduce that significantly," Neal McMahon told Reuters in a telephone interview.
"Broadly speaking they (pilots and cabin crew) recognise the grim situation we are in and they have been 
pragmatic."
Ryanair's Italian cabin crew union has put an agreement out to ballot, while there were further talks in Germany on 
Friday and the airline is in the middle of a collective redundancy process in Belgium, Ryanair People Director 
Darrell Hughes said.
While cabin crew in Spain failed to join pilots in agreeing terms this week, the collective bargaining system there 
allows Ryanair to implement the changes and Hughes was confident its position would stand up to challenge.
The executives added the airline had managed its pilot numbers without redundancies to date through a mixture of 
voluntary part time work, voluntary unpaid leave and spreading shifts around.
Ryanair to cut significantly fewer jobs after pay deals
Low-cost rival easyJet confirmed the loss of up to 670 jobs this week, part of a planned total of 4,500 that will also 
likely be trimmed due to agreements on part time contracts, base transfers and unpaid leave.
British Airways, owned by IAG, said in April it would need to axe up to 12,000 of its 42,000 staff to survive.
Ryanair this week reduced its capacity by a further 20% for September and October after a reimposition of some 
travel restrictions hit bookings.
McMahon and Hughes said the number of redundancies would depend on how winter booking fare and how much 
the pandemic disrupts travel next year. Ryanair increased flights to 60% of its normal schedule this month after 
resuming services in July.
"Airlines have for a long time relied on business traffic, visiting friends and relatives and maybe an older non-family 
market for travel in September, October, November," Hughes said.
"It's a big question as to what that level of demand is going to be, but it's not looking good at present." (Reuters)
