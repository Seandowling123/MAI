Body
 The 2014 restructuring net debit of EUR0.1 million which includes a credit of approximately EUR0.4 
million arising from a remeasurement of the provision (which was created for downsizing of Shannon line 
maintenance) following operational decisions made in 2014 which impacted the original estimates and 
assumptions in respect of maintenance of Boeing 757 aircraft as well as the costs of eliminating specific 
functions and roles (EUR0.5 million).
 The 2013 restructuring comparative comprises EUR1.0 million in respect of the severance cost for 
employees who exited under the legacy Greenfield cost reduction programme and EUR1.5 million of the then 
ongoing restructuring activity.
 Termination
 On 25 April 2013, Aer Lingus launched a Voluntary Severance Programme (the "Programme") for applicants 
who satisfied certain selection criteria. The target of the Programme was to reduce employee headcount 
levels by approximately 100 by the end of 2013. As of 30 June 2013, 37 applicants had formally agreed to 
participate in the Programme at a total cost of EUR3.0 million.
 As at 30 June 2014, 125 applicants had been accepted and had left employment with Aer Lingus.  A further 
2 applicants have formally agreed to participate in the Programme and leave employment with Aer Lingus 
during 2014. The related severance cost, including provisions, for these Programme participants of  EUR0.5 
million in the six months ended June 2014 (June 2013: EUR3.0 million) represent a termination cost under 
IAS 19R and are recognised within the restructuring and termination charges above.  Liabilities for unpaid 
termination benefits at the period end are included within business repositioning provisions (see Note 
17).
 (b)   The amount in 2014 relates to advice received in relation to the ongoing negotiation of pension 
issues. The comparative amount in 2013 includes the balance of bid defence costs associated with the 
takeover bid from the Group's largest shareholder Ryanair Holdings plc which was prohibited by the 
European Commission on 27 February 2013, as well as costs related to the negotiation of pension issues and 
fees relating to the capital reduction exercise.

 (2) At 30 June 2013, amounts relating to accrued interest receivable were presented within other amounts 
receivable.  At 31 December 2013 and 30 June 2014, accrued interest receivable has been presented within 
prepayments and accrued income as the Directors consider that this category best represents the nature of 
the asset.  For consistency, the comparative amounts at 30 June 2013 have been restated to reflect a 
reclassification of EUR6.1 million from other amounts receivable to prepayments and accrued income.  This 
reclassification had no impact on the primary financial statements.
 At 30(th) June 2014 and at 31 December 2013, amounts relating to VAT (EUR3.1 million and EUR1.9 million 
respectively) are included in the other amounts receivable balance. For consistency, the comparative 
(EUR2.6 million) at 30 June 2013 has been reclassified to be included within the other amounts receivable 
balance as it had been classified separately as VAT at 30 June 2013.

 (2) At 30 June 2013, amounts relating to accrued interest payable were presented within other payables.  
At 31 December 2013 and at 30 June 2014, accrued interest payable has been presented within accruals and 
deferred income, as the Directors consider that this category best represents the nature of the liability.  
For consistency, the comparative amounts at 30 June 2013 above have been restated to reflect a 
reclassification of EUR3.8 million from other payables to accruals and deferred income.  This 
reclassification had no impact on the primary financial statements.
 (3) In the six months to 30 June 2014 there was a significant increase in ticket sales in advance due to 
the seasonal impact of passengers purchasing tickets in advance of travel in the summer months.  The fares 
collected for future travel are recorded as a liability until the passenger has flown, at which time they 
are recognised as revenue.  The taxes and charges collected on these tickets are also recorded as a 
liability in other amounts payable until the passenger has flown, at which time they become payable to the 
relevant authorities. Also, transatlantic revenues in the first six months of 2014 were positively 
impacted by the commencement of new direct services from Dublin to Toronto and San Francisco which in turn 
has resulted in an increase in the ticket sales in advance.
 14            Derivative financial instruments
 Derivative financial instruments represent the fair value of open forward foreign exchange contracts and 
fuel price swaps to which the Group is a party at the reporting date. The fair value of these open 
positions is calculated by reference to the forward foreign exchange rates and forward fuel prices at the 
reporting date. In the six months to 30 June 2014 the fair value of fuel contract open positions has 
decreased due to the fact that fuel prices were US$15 per metric tonne lower at the period end than at 31 
December 2013. This was offset by the increased value of the Group's foreign exchange hedges.

 RYANAIR Q1 PROFIT RISES TO EUR197M, AS TRAFFIC GROWS 4%
 AVE. FARE RISES 9% DUE TO STRONG EASTER PERIOD
 Ryanair, Europe's biggest low fares airline today (July 28) announced a Q1 Net Profit of EUR197m, an increase of 
152% over last year, although cautioned that this result was distorted by the timing of a very strong Easter in Q1 
with no holiday period in the prior year comparable.  Traffic grew to 24.3m as load factors rose by 4% points to 
86%.  Average fare rose by 9%, boosted by a strong Easter period, while total revenues were up 11% to 
EUR1.496bn.  Unit costs fell by 2%, excluding fuel they rose by 1%.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Q1 profits were boosted by a strong Easter (but are somewhat distorted by the absence of Easter on the prior 
year Q1).  The earlier launch of our summer schedule and actively raising our forward bookings has delivered a 4% 
increase in load factor to 86% and enabled us to better manage close-in yields.  Ancillary Revenues rose 4% in line 
with traffic growth, as airport and baggage fee reductions were offset by the rising uptake of allocated seating.
 New Routes and Bases.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 Our 4 new bases at Athens, Brussels, Lisbon and Rome are performing strongly, as customers switch to Ryanair's 
lower fares and our industry leading customer service.  Our strategy to raise forward bookings continues to drive 
higher load factors and we expect to release our summer 2015 schedule in mid-September, some 3 months earlier 
than last year.
 This winter we will open 4 new bases in Cologne, Gdansk, Warsaw and Glasgow (Intl.) as well as substantially 
increasing new routes and frequencies at Stansted and Dublin as we invest heavily in our network to build 
schedules on key city pairs to make them more attractive for business customers.
 We are overrun with growth offers from primary European airports whose incumbent flag and regional carriers 
continue to cut capacity and traffic. These new airports along with our existing 69 bases offer Ryanair significant 
growth opportunities as the first of our 180 new Boeing order delivers this September.  These new aircraft, with the 
benefit of the much weaker US$, will drive significant cost efficiencies over the next 5 years.
 Customer Experience Improvement.
 Our "Always Getting Better" programme has delivered significant improvement to the customer experience.  In 
addition to the initiatives launched last September which included allocated seating, free 2(nd) carry-on bags, and 
an easier to use website with a "fare finder" facility, we launched our family product in June.  In July we released 
our industry leading mobile app (including mobile boarding passes) which has been very positively reviewed by 
independent commentators and our customers and has reached 1m downloads in the 10 days since its release.  In 
September we will launch Ryanair's business service which will include same day flight changes, bigger bag 
allowances, premium seat allocation, and fast-track through security at many Ryanair airports.  This new service 
along with our new routes, improved schedules and wider GDS distribution, will make Ryanair's low fares much 
more accessible to, and attractive for business customers.  We will continue this winter to rapidly develop both our 
website and mobile platform to deliver more innovative features and services in addition to the lowest fares to our 
customers.
 Fuel
 We are 90% hedged for FY15 at approx. $96 p.bl, which will deliver savings of EUR50m this year at current market 
rates.  This is lower than the EUR70m previously guided due to increased volumes in H2.  We have also hedged 
55% of our H1 FY16 fuel needs at approx. $95 p.bl and weaker US$ which will deliver a 2% fall in our unit fuel cost 
at current market rates.
 Bond Issue
 The BBB+ rating awarded by S&P and Fitch makes Ryanair the highest rated airline in the world. This rating 
reflects the strength of our Balance Sheet and our highly cash generative business model and enabled us in June 
to issue our first EUR850m unsecured Eurobond at a coupon of 1.875% fixed for 7 years.  This attractively priced 
financing (which was 7 times oversubscribed) will further reduce our aircraft ownership costs over the next 5 years.
 Shareholder returns
 In FY14 we completed EUR482m of share buybacks as part of our commitment to return
 EUR1 billion to shareholders over a 2 year period.  We now plan to return another EUR520m via a special dividend 
of 37.50 cents per ordinary share (subject to AGM approval) to be paid in Q4 FY15. This brings the total returns to 
shareholders since 2008 to over EUR2.5bn which is more than 4 times the EUR585m originally raised from 
shareholders since our 1997 IPO.
 Outlook
 Based on these Q1 results and our strong forward bookings it is clear that we are on track to deliver a strong H1, 
during which traffic will grow by 3%, and fares will rise by 6% subject to late booking fares in Aug. and Sept.  
However we would strongly caution both analysts and investors against any irrational exuberance in what continues 
to be a difficult economic environment, with some company-specific challenges in H2.
 We expect H2 to be characterised by a much softer pricing environment as many competitors are lowering fares, 
partly in response to Ryanair's strong forward bookings.  Added to this Ryanair will aggressively raise capacity this 
winter by 8% (7% in Q3 and 10% in Q4) to take advantage of growth discounts and build out business friendly 
frequencies from Dublin and Stansted in particular.  These initiatives will inevitably put downward pressure on fares 
and (mindful of last winter's weak pricing environment) we continue to expect H2 yields to fall by between 6% to 8% 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
which will result in full year yields rising by only 2%.  Unit costs (ex-fuel) for FY15 will rise by approx. 4%, which is 
slightly better than the 5% increase we originally guided, due to higher H2 traffic volumes which will be positive for 
unit costs.
 In summary, we now expect full year traffic to grow by 5% to 86m.  This increased traffic and higher load factors, 
combined with a slightly improved performance on unit costs allows us to cautiously raise our full year profit after 
tax guidance (from the previous range EUR580m to EUR620m) to a range of EUR620m to EUR650m. However this 
guidance, which is about a 21% rise over last year's net profit, is heavily, reliant upon the final outturn for H2 yields 
over which we currently have zero visibility".

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and 
Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's favourite low fares airline, operating more than 1,600 daily flights (over 500,000 per year) from 
69 bases, across 1,600 low fare routes, connecting 186 destinations in 30 countries and operating a fleet of 297

13.     Share buy-back
 There were no share buy-backs in the period.  In the quarter ended June 30, 2013 the Company bought back 
24.1m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6m.  This was equivalent to approximately 1.7% of the 
Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.  Accordingly, share 
capital decreased by 24.1m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.2m and the capital redemption 
reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.2m.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created 
under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 14.     Eurobond
 In June 2014, Ryanair issued a 7 year unsecured eurobond, under its EMTN programme, with a coupon of 
1.875% p.a. and a notional principal of EUR850 million. The issue price on the bond was 99.52% which 
generated proceeds of approx. EUR846 million following discounting.
 15.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended June 30, 2014 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2013 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 16.     Post balance sheet events
 There were no significant post balance sheet events.

 Profit after tax increased by 152% to EUR196.8m primarily due to a 9% increase in average fares and a 
stronger load factor (up 4 points to 86%), partially offset by a 2% increase in total operating expenses.  
Total operating revenues increased by 11% to EUR1,495.7m, primarily due to a 14% increase in scheduled 
revenues to EUR1,125.0m, driven by the 9% increase in average fare, due to the timing of Easter in this 
quarter and its absence in the prior year comparative along with a strong increase in load factor.  
Ancillary revenue was up 4%, in line with the growth in passenger numbers, to EUR370.7m.  Fuel, which 
represents 45% of total operating costs in the current quarter and 47% in the comparative quarter, 
decreased by 2% to EUR563.8m due to a lower euro price per gallon paid.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 
1%, however, including fuel unit costs fell by 2%. Operating margin, as a result of the above, increased 
by 7 points to 15% whilst operating profit increased by 124% to EUR231.8m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 11% to EUR1,495.7m primarily due to a 9% increase in average fare, 
boosted by the timing of Easter, the strength of sterling against the euro and a 4% increase in traffic to 
24.3m. Ancillary revenues grew in line with the increase in passenger numbers.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 7%, primarily due to the strong growth in scheduled revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 14% to EUR1,125.0m due to a 9% rise in average fares, partially 
due to the timing of Easter and its absence in the prior year comparative along with the strength of 
sterling to the euro. Load factor rose by 4 points to 86%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 4% to EUR370.7m, in line with the 4% increase in passenger numbers.
 Total operating expenses increased by 2% to EUR1,263.9m due to the increased costs associated with the 
growth of the airline offset by a 2% reduction in fuel costs.
 Fuel & oil costs decreased by 2% to EUR563.8m due to a lower euro fuel price per gallon in the quarter.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 11%, as planned, to EUR195.1m, due to the mix of new routes and 
bases launched at primary airports, a 4% increase in passenger numbers and the strengthening of sterling 
against the euro.
 Route charges were down EUR0.7m as sectors flown remained flat.
 Staff costs increased by 2% to EUR132.7m in line with the 2% pay increase granted in April 2014.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR96.7m due to the purchase of 9 additional spare 
engines in the period and the higher level of maintenance activity during the quarter.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by 11% to EUR59.6m, due 
to higher marketing spend to support the customer experience improvements and the launch of new routes and 
bases.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
 Maintenance costs increased by EUR5.4m, to EUR35.2m, primarily due to the inclusion in the prior year 
comparative of a one off credit of EUR3.7m arising from the renegotiation of maintenance contracts, and 
the remainder of the increase is due to higher line maintenance costs arising from the launch of new 
bases.
 Aircraft rental costs remained relatively flat at EUR26.3m, reflecting a lower number of leased aircraft 
in the quarter (June 30, 2014: 51) compared to the prior year (June 30, 2013: 57), offset by short term 
summer leases (June 30, 2014: 5).
 Operating margin increased by 7 points to 15% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits 
have increased by 124% to EUR231.8m.
 Finance expense decreased by 13% to EUR19.0m due to lower interest rates on our floating rate debt and 
new, low cost, borrowings.
 Finance income remained flat at EUR9.1m as higher cash deposits were offset by lower interest rates.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR1,241.6m since March 31, 2014 to EUR4,483.3m and Gross debt rose by EUR756.8m 
to EUR3,840.4m.  The Group generated EUR616.0m cash from operating activities and approx. EUR846m from its 
debut eurobond issuance in June 2014 (see note 14). This funded net capital expenditure of EUR133.2m and 
debt repayments of EUR91.1m. As a result the Group had a stronger net cash position of EUR642.9m at period 
end (March 31, 2014: EUR158.1m).
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR237.1m to EUR3,522.9m in the period due to the net profit after tax 
of EUR196.8m and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives.
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.          Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the three months ended June 30, 2014 comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2013 Annual Report for the year, ended March 31, 2013, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2013, are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2013 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group 
Accounts) Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 
31, 2013, together with the independent auditor's report thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar 
of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's 
Website.  The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the interim 
financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 on July 25, 2014.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the financial year beginning 
on or after January 1, 2014, and have also been endorsed by the EU, have been applied by the Group for the 
first time in the consolidated financial statements;
 --      IAS 32 (amendment) "Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 39 (amendment) "Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRIC 21 "Levies" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations in the quarter ended June 30, 2014.
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of 
these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations.

for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016).
 --      IAS 15, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2017).
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.         Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.        Income tax expense

Body
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 
was 12.0% (June 30, 2013: 11.7%).  The tax charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 of EUR26.8m (June 
30, 2013: EUR10.4m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.         Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR0.5m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.         Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.         Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2014 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 297 (2013: 303) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  Following 
shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, the Group has agreed to purchase 180 new Boeing 737 800NG 
aircraft during the periods Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2019.
 8.        Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR260.3m at March 31, 2013 to EUR230.9m at 
March 31, 2014 is comprised of a loss of EUR29.4m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the decrease in the Aer Lingus share price from approximately EUR1.64 per share at March 31, 
2014 to approximately EUR1.45 per share at June 30, 2014.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties.  The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 11.     Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the period to June 30, 2014 amounted to EUR133.2m and is primarily aircraft pre 
delivery payments and the cost of spare engines purchased.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2013 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Company's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available for sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at June 30, 2014 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter to June 30, 2014, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at June 30, 2014 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the quarter to June 
30, 2014 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EU CONFIRMATION THAT AIRPORT DEALS COMPLY WITH STATE AID RULES
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (23 July) welcomed the EU Commission's confirmation 
that Ryanair's airport agreements at Niederrhein Airport comply with the State aid rules (Market Economy 
Investor Principle). This finding is consistent with the EU Commission's and EU Court's previous rulings 
that Ryanair's airport agreements with Aarhus, Bratislava, Charleroi, Marseille, Berlin Schönefeld and 
Tampere airports also comply with EU State aid rules.
 Ryanair also noted the EU Commission's decisions concerning Pau (ceased operations in March 2011) and 
Angouleme (ceased operations in October 2009) airports, and Nimes airport where Ryanair currently operates 
4 routes.  All of Ryanair's airport arrangements comply with the EU State aid rules and Ryanair has 
therefore instructed its lawyers to appeal these rulings to the extent they erroneously allege otherwise.
 Ryanair's Director of Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Juliusz Komorek said:
 "Today's decisions confirm that Ryanair's airport agreements at Niederrhein Airport comply with the EU 
State aid rules (Market Economy Investor Principle).  Following the closure of this case and the earlier 
six positive decisions at Aarhus, Bratislava, Charleroi, Marseille, Berlin Schönefeld and Tampere 
airports, we will immediately appeal the decisions in Pau, Angouleme and Nimes cases where the EU 
Commission mistakenly suggested that the airports' agreements with Ryanair did not fully comply with the 
EU State aid rules.
 Ryanair has to date carried 86.5m passengers at the 7 airports where our commercial arrangements have 
been confirmed by the EU Commission and the EU Court to comply with EU law, compared to just 3.4m 
passengers at the airports where the Commission today suggested that the airport agreements did not comply 
with State aid rules.
 We remain committed to growing traffic from the current 85mppa to over 110mppa by FY2019, in partnership 
with both private and public airports across Europe where all of our arrangements are arms-length 
commercial deals consistent with the EU Market Economy Investor Principle."

 Results for the year ended 31 March 2014
 MAG has delivered the commercial and operational strategy first described to investors in February 2014 
and the integration of Stansted is ahead of plan. Prospects going forward are strong with the Group 
benefitting from the increased scale following the Stansted acquisition and management firmly focused on 
commercial development, operational efficiency and long-term infrastructure.
 --      MAG continues to grow passenger numbers - up 4.3% to 43.8 million for the twelve months to March 
2014. Passenger numbers are on a positive trajectory at Stansted after a number of years of decline.
 --      The Manchester route network was further diversified with the announcement of the first direct 
link from Manchester to China as well as new long-haul routes to Charlotte, Jeddah, and Toronto. There was 
also an extension of European and short-haul connectivity with important route announcements from Ryanair, 
easyJet, Thomson, Thomas Cook and Monarch.
Manchester Airport Grp Funding PLC Annual Results
 --      Stansted has excellent European connectivity and significant progress has been made in broadening 
the network and developing a long-haul offering. Thomas Cook has announced the first direct long-haul 
routes from Stansted with services to Las Vegas, Cancun and Orlando for the Summer 2014 season.
 --      Ryanair's announcement of its Winter 2014 schedule at Stansted included 8 new routes, increased 
frequencies and improved schedules on 36 routes and growth from 490 to 700 weekly flights. The additional 
capacity will generate over 2 million additional Stansted passengers.
 --      The growth in passenger numbers combined with yield improvements and on-going underlying cost 
management translated into a strong set of financial results.
 --      Group EBITDA increased GBP7 million to GBP242 million (+2.8%) with a particularly encouraging set 
of results from the Legacy MAG businesses (EBITDA up by GBP14 million to GBP153 million (+9.8%)).
 --      Stansted's reported EBITDA was down GBP7 million year-on-year but was impacted by a number of 
non-recurring items in connection with the integration and transformation programmes.
 --      On an underlying basis Stansted's EBITDA increased by GBP2 million and in the first full year of 
ownership was GBP6 million ahead of our Business Plan. The acceleration in passenger growth in the latter 
part of the year reinforced by the integration and transformation strategies are already yielding benefits 
and generating a strong and growing run rate into FY15.
 --      The Stansted integration programme is ahead of plan and will provide a resilient platform for 
growth through the commercialisation of key activities and operational improvements:
 --      Significant long term commercial contracts with key airlines have significantly de-risked revenue 
growth;
 --      New car parking products introduced and distribution channels opened;
 --      Major long-term concessions agreements underpinning the terminal re-development have been agreed 
and more are progressing through the tender process;
 --      All commercial negotiations and relationships managed centrally from Day 1;
 --      Tight cost control and focus on delivery of operational efficiency programmes;
 --      IT separation from Heathrow completed five months ahead of plan in March 2014; and
 --      Full supply chain review and leverage of Group-wide scale.
 --      MAG continues to benefit from a well-invested asset base and discretionary capital expenditure is 
subject to need and a robust investment appraisal process.  Total capital expenditure for the year ended 
31 March 2014 was GBP135 million including the new GBP20 million air traffic control tower opening at 
Manchester, the GBP12m East Midlands terminal redevelopment nearing completion, and continued expansion in 
the car park estate at Manchester and East Midlands.
 --      MAG is also investing GBP40 million in the re-development of the Stansted terminal with retail 
partners contributing up to another GBP40 million. The project is proceeding to plan and will transform 
the passenger experience and increase retail yields. The new security facility opened in December 2013 and 
the 25,000 sq. ft. walkthrough Duty Free store opens this summer. On completion, the project will double 
airside retail space, improve passenger flows and provide 100% footfall for all units.
 --      The Civil Aviation Authority's decision to fully de-regulate Stansted, including cargo, from 1 
April 2014 onwards provides cost and commercial upside and endorses MAG's commercial approach.
 --      The Airports Commission published its interim report in December 2013 and emphasised the 
significant spare capacity at both Stansted and Manchester. MAG welcomes the report's support of 
enhancements to rail and road connectivity and the acknowledgement of Stansted as an important option for 
an additional runway after 2030.
 --      MAG successfully refinanced the majority of the Stansted acquisition bank debt through the 
issuance of two listed bonds. Strong trading performance combined with an appropriate financing policy 
underpins stable financial leverage (3.6x net debt to EBITDA) and enables MAG to continue to invest in the 
asset base and fund future growth.
 --      MAG remains committed to sustaining strong investment grade credit ratings with dividend levels 
guided by the appropriate financial risk profile for the Group.
 Neil Thompson, Chief Financial Officer of MAG, said:
 "The Group has delivered another strong year of financial performance, exceeding its financial targets 
and delivering continued growth. We've secured an increase of 4.3% in passenger volumes, and through 
continued focus on commercial drivers and operational efficiencies, have delivered significant growth and 
increased earnings of GBP242 million for the year.
 "The announcement of the first direct link between Manchester and China was significant and we have 
continued to perform well adding long-haul routes such as Charlotte, Jeddah, and Toronto at Manchester for 
this Summer. While there has also been an extension of European and short-haul connectivity with important 
route announcements from the likes of Ryanair, EasyJet, Thomson Airways, Thomas Cook and Monarch at our 
airports.
 "The initial integration of Stansted into MAG has been successfully completed and the wide-ranging 
development and investment into the airport is well underway. The significant activity at Stansted and 
across MAG this year will generate continued strong performance and growth in 2014-15 and beyond.
Manchester Airport Grp Funding PLC Annual Results
 "The investment being made in our airport infrastructure combined with the considerable existing spare 
capacity means that over the short term, medium and long term we expect Stansted and Manchester will 
continue to play a key role in delivering UK aviation growth."
 Note on Comparative Financial Information
 MAG completed the acquisition of Stansted on 28 February 2013 therefore the statutory financial results 
for the year ended 31March 2013 included only one month of Stansted trading. To aid comparability the 
prior year comparatives presented here are on a pro forma basis and include 12 months of Stansted trading 
for the year ended 31 March 2013. These figures were previously disclosed in the "Pro Forma Financial 
Information" section of the MAG Offering Circular published in February 2014 but are adjusted for the 
amendment to IAS19 and the revenue classification aligned with the current management reporting view.

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES 3 NEW SCOTTISH ROUTES TO DUBLIN & LONDON
 EDINBURGH-LONDON, GLASGOW-LONDON & GLASGOW-DUBLIN 3 TIMES DAILY
 NEW GLASGOW INTL BASE & OVER 3M CUSTOMERS FOR SCOTLAND
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (3 July) announced significant growth for Scotland with 3 new routes 
between Edinburgh and London, Glasgow and London and Glasgow and Dublin (three times daily), as well as a 
new base at Glasgow International (Ryanair's 69(th) in total), which will deliver over 3m customers, as Ryanair 
invests over $450m in Scotland.
 Ryanair's existing once daily flight from Glasgow Prestwick to Dublin will now switch to Glasgow Intl as part of an 
expanded 3 times daily business service between Glasgow and Dublin. Despite this switch Ryanair remains 
committed to its long standing base at Prestwick where the airline has a major maintenance facility and is currently 
in discussions with Glasgow Prestwick and the Scottish Government, its new owners, to explore growth 
opportunities to/from Prestwick.
 From October 2014, Ryanair will deliver:
 Edinburgh:
 3 based aircraft
 1 new business route to/from London Stansted (3 times daily)
 16 winter routes in total
 79 weekly return flights
 Over 1.8m customers p.a.
 Glasgow International:
 New base (3(rd) in Scotland)
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LAUNCHES NEW SCOTTISH ROUTES AND NEW BASE
 1 based aircraft
 2 new business routes to/from Dublin and London Stansted (3 times daily)
 7 winter routes in total (to/from Bydgoszcz, Derry, Riga, Warsaw Modlin & Wroclaw)
 55 weekly return flights
 Over 850,000 customers p.a.
 Glasgow Prestwick
 1 based aircraft
 7 winter routes in total (to/from Alicante, Barcelona Girona, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, Malaga & 
Tenerife)
 13 weekly return flights
 Over 500,000 customers p.a.
 Ryanair celebrated its Scottish growth and 3 new business routes by releasing 100,000 seats for sale across its 
European network, at prices from GBP19.99 for travel in August, September and October. These low fare seats are 
available for booking until midnight Monday (7 July). Ryanair's new Scottish routes go on sale on the Ryanair.com 
website tomorrow at fares from just GBP19.99, which are almost half of BA's and 40% cheaper than Easyjet's.
 In Edinburgh today, Ryanair's Chief Commercial Officer, David O'Brien said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to launch three new Scottish routes, between Edinburgh and London, Glasgow and London, 
and Glasgow and Dublin, starting this October, with three daily return flights on each route at fares starting from just 
GBP19.99, which are half of BA's fares and 40% cheaper than Easyjet's, in response to strong demand for 
Ryanair's low fares from Scottish consumers and business customers, and increased competition between Scottish 
airports. Ryanair will also open a new base at Glasgow International this winter, with 7 new routes and will deliver 
more than 500,000 new customers through Scottish airports this year.
 Scottish consumers already choose Ryanair for our low fares, industry leading customer service and great route 
choice. Now they can also book their flights on our improved website, carry a free small 2nd carry-on bag, enjoy 
allocated seats, avail of our recently announced new Family Extra service, and use their personal electronic devices 
at all stages of their flight, making Ryanair the ideal choice for families and friends. We also have a new app and 
business product coming soon, as Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares.
 However, Scotland cannot fulfil its true tourism potential until Air Passenger Duty is removed and we would urge 
Scotland to follow the example of Ireland, where Ryanair has launched 21 new routes and will deliver over 1.2m 
new customers this year, in response to the Irish Government's welcome decision to scrap APD. Regardless of the 
outcome of the referendum, Scotland cannot unlock its full potential until APD is repealed."

 RYANAIR'S DEPUTY CEO & CFO HOWARD MILLAR
 TO STEP DOWN AFTER 23 YEARS
 WILL JOIN BOARD IN 2015 AS NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
 Ryanair today (30 June) announced that Howard Millar, the airline's Deputy CEO & CFO, has decided to step 
down as a full time executive in December 2014, after an outstandingly successful 23 years, to pursue other career 
opportunities.  Having joined Ryanair as Financial Controller in April 1992, he was promoted to Finance Director in 
1993, and appointed CFO and Deputy CFO in January 2003.
 Howard has played a leading role in the successful development of Ryanair into Europe's largest airline, growing 
from less than 1m to over 80m passengers p.a. and was a pivotal figure in many of the airlines key developments, 
including the transformation from a loss making regional carrier, to Europe's first and most successful low fares 
airline, its 1997 IPO, its subsequent 530 new aircraft orders and related financings, and most recently its very 
successful debut EUR850m Bond issue.
 In light of Howard's enormous contribution to the development of Ryanair, Chairman David Bonderman has invited 
him to join the Board of Ryanair as a Non-Executive Director in mid-2015, some six months after he steps down as 
a full-time executive and Howard has accepted this offer.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said;
 "I sincerely thank Howard for his enormous contribution to Ryanair's successful growth over the last 23 years. He 
has been a pioneer in the development of low fare air travel in Europe, as well as in aircraft financing, commodity 
risk and fuel management, IT systems and treasury fields of the aviation industry.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR HOWARD MILLAR STEP DOWN-JOIN BOARD IN 2015
 While he will be greatly missed, he has over the years developed an excellent senior management team in 
Finance, and his replacement (via internal promotion) will be announced later this morning to facilitate a smooth 
transition.
 Although sorry to lose Howard as a senior executive, I'm pleased that he has agreed to join the Board as a Non-
Executive Director from mid 2015, where he will continue to offer insight, guidance and wise counsel to the airline 
as we grow from 85m to over 110m over the next 5 years."
 Ryanair's Howard Millar said:
 "It has been an absolute honour to have played a central role in the building of Ryanair into Europe's largest airline 
over the last 23 years and in the process to have enabled hundreds of millions of customers to enjoy the benefits of 
low fare air travel.  I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Michael and the hugely talented team at Ryanair over 
that period to create a unique and successful business model which has seen traffic grow from less than 1m to over 
80m p.a.
 I am very pleased to accept our Chairman, David Bonderman's invitation to join the Board in mid 2015, and look 
forward to working with the Board to guide Ryanair in its next phase of profitable growth to over 110m passengers 
p.a. in 2019.  As I leave Ryanair as a full-time executive from December next, I look forward to new career 
opportunities and challenges, and am confident that my successor and the Ryanair team will continue to drive the 
business forward."

has worked with Howard for the past 12 years and has been a key member of the Finance senior management 
team.  He will work closely with Howard over the next six months to ensure a smooth transition as Howard 
departs to take up new career challenges.
 All of us in Ryanair look forward to working with Neil as he becomes Chief Financial Officer.  He has a 
hard act to follow, but as we enter into a 5 year period of renewed growth, with new aircraft deliveries 
starting in September and a rapidly improving customer experience, we all believe that Neil is the right 
person to fill the void left by Howard."
 Ryanair's Howard Millar said:
 "I have every confidence in Neil, having recruited and worked closely with him over the last 12 years.  
He has been a pivotal member of the Finance senior management team, with a broad range of experience in 
treasury, financial reporting, taxation, investor relations, and more recently in our successful first 
bond issue.  I am particularly pleased that the time and effort we have invested in developing a very 
strong senior management team will ensure there is a smooth transition of the finance function to Neil 
over the next six months."

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES THE ISSUE OF EUR850M EURO BOND AT 1.875% FIXED FOR 7 YEARS
 Ryanair Holdings Plc today (10 June) announced that it has issued an EUR850m Euro Bond at 1.875%, fixed for 7 
years. This is Ryanair's first ever Euro Bond debt issuance and is part of its plans to access the debt capital 
markets to source low cost financing for its new 180 Boeing 737-800 NG order, deliveries of which start in 
September 2014, and will enable Ryanair to grow by 40% over the next 5 years to over 110m customers p.a.
 Ryanair received a BBB+ rating from Standard & Poor's and Fitch, making Ryanair the highest rated airline in the 
world. These ratings reflect the strength of Ryanair's business model which has a long established track record of 
profitability, cash generation, and a very strong balance sheet with low levels of debt.
 The bond will be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange which offers access to investors both in Europe and the rest of 
the world. The global coordinator for the bond was Citibank and the joint book runners were BNP Paribas, Citibank, 
and Deutsche Bank.
 Commenting on the bond issuance, Ryanair's Chief Financial Officer & Deputy CEO, Howard Millar said:
 "We are very pleased with the issue of our first ever Euro Bond for EUR850m at 1.875% fixed for 7 years.  The 
bond was more than 8 times over-subscribed which reflects very strong demand from investors right across Europe.
 Investors were attracted both by Ryanair's BBB+ ratings from S&P and from Fitch, making us the highest rated 
airline in the world, and by the strength of Ryanair's business model, which is strongly cash generative, with a long 
track record of profitability, and a superior balance sheet with low levels of leverage.
 This low cost financing, along with our attractively priced Boeing order for 180 aircraft, will enable us to reduce our 
aircraft ownership costs, and pass these savings on to our customers by continuing to offer the lowest fares in 
Europe, while growing from 82m customers to over 110m p.a. over the next 5 years."

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month the Company's undiluted NAV gained 2.0% and the share price
 rose by 2.5%. For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index returned 2.0%
 during the same period.
European equities rose during May, benefiting on a broad basis from a weakening
 of the Euro, an easing of Russian tensions and an apparent bottoming out in
 data from China. The rotation (out of momentum and cyclicals, into defensives
 and Emerging Markets exposed names) which began in March and increased in
 magnitude during April continued into May, at least for the first two to three
 weeks of the month. Peripheral bond spreads also widened, albeit briefly, in
 response to weaker than expected economic data from Portugal and Italy, marking
 the first time that fixed income markets had participated in the rotation.
 Later in the month, markets were calmed following the European parliamentary
 elections; although we saw a strong rise in support for Euro sceptic parties in
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 France, UK and the Netherlands, this did not mark a significant change to the
 workings of the parliament. In Italy, Renzi gained more support than expected,
 providing further backing for the potential reforms and, despite the momentary
 rise running into the elections, peripheral bond yields found new lows towards
 the end of May.
Stock selection was the main driver of the outperformance, while sector
 allocation also detracted. From a sector perspective, the Company's underweight
 position to oil & gas (zero exposure) contributed to returns while an
 overweight position in financials and industrials detracted. Stock selection
 within financials significantly contributed to returns. This was again
 noticeable from the strong performance of Garanti Bankasi and Halk Bankasi;
 however, the top performing position was Sberbank of Russia. The Russian bank
 has performed well after tensions between the Ukraine and Russia subsided
 somewhat. A position in Hungarian OTP Bank also performed well but this was in
 contrast to financial names within developed Europe as holdings in Société
 Générale, Unicredit, ING, KBC and AXA were all detractors to returns.
A position in Novo Nordisk was the Company's largest detractor over the month
 after announcing disappointing sales figures for Q1 even though they were
 expected to be weak. Although this year may be more of a 'transition' year for
 the business we still believe that the strong pipeline potential for insulin
 treatment is attractive and that the company remains one of the highest quality
 franchises in Europe.
At the end of the month, the Company was positioned with higher weightings in
 industrials, consumer services, financials and health care and with lower
 weightings in consumer goods, oil & gas, basic materials, telecoms, utilities
 and technology.
Outlook
 Global economic growth is expected to be positive for 2014 but the magnitude is
 less certain given China slowing and US tapering. European data is increasingly
 pointing to a recovery and is particularly encouraging for the periphery.
 European political and public policy uncertainty is declining and the peak of
 austerity is behind us.
Consensus earnings estimates have moderated since the beginning of 2014 with
 international earnings continuing to come under pressure from FX headwinds,
 while European domestic earnings are now more realistic and have scope to
 benefit from a domestic recovery. We maintain our projection of 8% earnings
 growth this year in Europe.
Monetary policy remains key to global growth and the ECB may need to apply new
 measures to stave off disinflation risks in the Eurozone.
We are spending significant time analysing the factors that can help us piece
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 together the road map over the next two years. The ability of individual
 companies to deliver above their expected earnings will also be key over this
 period.

our improving customer experience, including our great new website, allocated seating, a free 2(nd) small carry-on 
bag and PED (portable electric device) use on all flights. Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the 
lowest fares for our 82.3m customers.
 We are especially pleased with the 3% point improvement in May load factor, which is slightly ahead of our 2% 
point growth target."

 RYANAIR REPORTS FULL YEAR NET PROFIT OF EUR523M
 TRAFFIC GROWS 3% TO 81.7M - LOAD FACTOR UP 1% TO 83%
 Ryanair, Europe's biggest low fares airline today (May 19) announced full year net profit of EUR523m, slightly 
ahead of previous guidance.  Traffic grew 3% to 81.7m passengers.  Revenue per passenger was flat, as strong 
ancillary revenue growth offset a 4% fall in average fares.  Excluding fuel, sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 
3%.

"Ryanair's, Michael O'Leary, said:
 The highlights of the past financial year include:-
 --    Customer experience improving rapidly.
 --    New website launched with "fare finder" facility.
 --    121 new routes.
 --    8 new bases - Athens, Thessaloniki, Brussels, Lisbon, Rome (FCO), Catania, Lamezia & Palermo.
 --    180 new aircraft ordered, delivery 2014 to 2018.
 --    Fares launched on GDS (Galileo & Worldspan) and Google flight search.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 --    Net profit of EUR523m despite a 4% fall in avg fares.
 --    EUR482m share buyback completed.
 While disappointing that profits fell 8% to EUR523m due mainly to a 4% decline in fares, weaker sterling, 
and higher fuel costs, we reacted quickly to this weaker environment last September by lowering fares and 
improving our customer experience which caused H2 traffic to grow 4% as load factors rose 1%.  Ancillary 
revenues grew 17%, much faster than traffic growth, and now accounts for 25% of total revenues.
 New Routes and Bases
 Forward bookings for Summer 14 are significantly ahead of last year, since we began offering lower fares 
and released our seasonal schedules earlier, and this should continue to deliver 2% higher load factors, 
and help us manage fares closer to departure as we have less capacity to sell.
 We recently opened 4 new bases at Athens, Brussels, Lisbon and Rome.  These are performing ahead of 
expectation as customers switch from high fare carriers to Ryanair's lower fares and industry leading 
customer service.  We announced 3 new bases for winter 2014 in Cologne, Gdansk, and Warsaw.  We released 
our winter 2014 schedule 3 months earlier than last year, offering our customers lower fares much earlier 
than our competitors, while we focus on building frequency and capacity on key business city pairs. We 
expect these new bases will provide significant growth opportunities as we start deliveries (Sept 2014) of 
our new Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft order.
 Customer Experience Improvement
 We have worked hard over the last 6 months to improve customer experience and enhance our industry 
leading service (lowest fares, most on-time flights, the youngest fleet). These initiatives include, (i) 
allocated seating (ii) a simpler, easier to use, website with a brilliant "fare finder" facility, (iii) 
free small 2(nd) carry-on bag, (iv) "quiet flights" (v) a 24 hour "grace period" to correct minor booking 
errors, (vi) reduced boarding card and airport bag fees, and (vii) a new service to cater for groups and 
corporate travellers.  Our new family product will launch in June and will allow children (when travelling 
with their family) to receive discounts on allocated seats and bags, while families who travel frequently 
with Ryanair can qualify for discounts on future flights.  In the autumn we will launch a business service 
in conjunction with our frequency build on key business routes which will include, same day flight 
changes, bigger bag allowances, premium seat allocation, mobile boarding pass, and fast-track through 
security at many Ryanair airports. This service, together with our new GDS distribution strategy, will 
make Ryanair much more accessible and easier to use for business customers.
 Digital & Distribution Improvements
 Our new digital strategy began to roll out last November with a much easier to use website, cutting the 
booking process from 17 to 5 "clicks".  More recently we unveiled a new website with "fare finder" which 
enables customers to easily find our lowest fares, share these fares with their friends and book them 
quickly. The "My Ryanair" registration service has been welcomed by customers with over 2m already 
registered.  We will continue to invest in web and digital improvements over the coming year, as we 
deliver an industry leading mobile app (tailored for smart phones and tablets) by mid-summer, and improve 
our digital marketing and CRM services for the benefit of all our customers.
 In April, we began extensive TV and outdoor advertising in major EU markets to promote our new website 
and recent customer experience improvements.  These campaigns will continue through the year, as our 
marketing and advertising spend rises to approx. EUR35m (from just EUR10m last year), although this spend 
is still less than EUR0.50 per passenger.
 We have broadened our distribution by becoming the first low fares airline in Europe to partner with 
Google's "Flight Search" function, which is now available in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, 
Ireland, Poland and Spain (and more countries follow shortly). This partnership enables consumers to 
easily access and book Ryanair's lower fares every time they search on Google.  In April we began 
distribution on Galileo and Worldspan GDS systems, which allows travel and corporate agents to see and 
book Ryanair's low fares.  We are in talks with other GDS's (to broaden our distribution base) and hope to 
add more before year end.  Our new Groups and Corporate travel service launched in January and take up of 
these services is growing rapidly.
 Fuel
 We are 90% hedged for FY15 at a cost of $960 per tonne (approx. $96 p.bl).  This will generate net 
savings of approx. EUR70m compared to FY14.  In light of recent oil price and US$ weakness we have hedged 
approx. 13% of our FY16 fuel (at approx. $94 per barrel), and have also hedged our dollar requirements 
which will deliver further savings of up to 4% per passenger, in Euro terms, in FY 2016.
 Balance Sheet
 Our balance sheet remains among the strongest in the industry and was a key factor in S&P and Fitch 
recently awarding BBB+ ratings to Ryanair, making us the highest rated airline in the world.  During FY14 
we completed EUR482m of share buybacks, well ahead of our original EUR400m target.  We remain committed to 
returning a further EUR500m to shareholders in Q4 via a special dividend subject to AGM approval. This 
will bring the total returns to Ryanair shareholders since 2008 to over EUR2.5bn. Our business model 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
remains strongly cash generative and year end cash amounted to EUR3.2bn (net cash of EUR158m), despite 
EUR482m in buybacks, debt repayments of EUR391m, and capex of EUR506m during the year.
 Outlook.
 We expect FY15 traffic to grow by 4% to over 84.6m as load factors increase 2% to 85% and we add some 
limited new route and capacity growth.  Most of this growth will be skewed towards H2 as we reduce our 
winter grounding from 70 aircraft in FY14 to approx. 50 in FY15.  While fares fell by 4% in FY14 we expect 
FY15 fares to rise by up to 2%.   H1 fares will rise by up to 6% due in part to Easter, stable growth in 
Q2, and stronger forward bookings and load factors.  However we remain very cautious about H2 guidance 
(especially following last winter's weak price environment) where we are committed to 6% capacity growth 
which could cause H2 fares to fall by as much as 6% to 8%.
 Unit costs for FY15 will be flat.  Fuel costs (which includes de-icing) will be EUR70m lower than last 
year as we are 90% hedged, but we expect de-icing costs to rise from last year's unusually mild winter.  
Excluding fuel unit costs will rise by approx. 5% reflecting pay increases, primary airport charges, a 
EUR25m rise in advertising and marketing, and ownership cost increases due to summer lease ins and new 
aircraft deliveries from September onwards.
 In conclusion, we expect this combination of a strong H1, but a weaker H2 will generate a significant 
rise in after tax profits to a range of between EUR580m to EUR620m, although this guidance is heavily 
qualified by H2 yield outturn, over which we currently have zero visibility.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Summary year ended March 31, 2014
 Profit after tax decreased by 8% to EUR522.8m compared to EUR569.3m in the year ended March 31, 2013 
primarily due to a 5% increase in total operating expenses and a 4% reduction in average fares, offset by 
strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic. Total operating revenues increased by 3% to EUR5,036.7m, 
primarily due to the 17% growth in ancillary revenues to EUR1,247.2m, significantly faster than the 3% 
increase in traffic, offset by a 4% reduction in average fare due to the summer heat wave in Northern 
Europe, the weakening of sterling to the euro, the timing of Easter, the June French ATC strike, and an 8% 
fall in average fares in H2. Total revenue per passenger, as a result, remained flat. Load Factor 
increased by 1 point to 83% compared to the year ended March 31, 2013.
 Total operating expenses increased by 5% to EUR4,378.1m, due to increased fuel prices and the higher 
level of activity. Fuel, which represents 46% of total operating costs compared to 45% in the comparative 
period, increased by 7% to EUR2,013.1m due to the higher euro price per gallon paid and increased activity 
in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 1% (sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 3%) 
and including fuel they rose by 2%.  Operating margin decreased by 2 points to 13% whilst operating profit 
decreased by 8% to EUR658.6m.
 Net margin was down 2 points to 10%, compared to March 31, 2013.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 36.96 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 
39.45 euro cent at March 31, 2013.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash decreased by EUR317.3m since March 31, 2013 to EUR3,241.7m and gross debt fell by EUR414.7m to 
EUR3,083.6m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR1,044.6m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR505.8m, a EUR481.7m share buy-back programme and debt repayments.  As a result the Group 
had net cash of EUR158.1m at period end (March 31, 2013: EUR60.7m).
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2014
 Profit after tax decreased by 8% to EUR522.8m primarily due to a 5% increase in total operating expenses 
and a 4% reduction in average fares, offset by strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic.  Total 
operating revenues increased by 3% to EUR5,036.7m primarily due to a 17% increase in ancillary revenues 
and a 3% rise in traffic offset by a 4% reduction in average fares.  Fuel, which represents 46% of total 
operating costs compared to 45% in the comparative period, increased by 7% to EUR2,013.1m due to a higher 
euro price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 
1% (sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 3%) and including fuel they rose by 2%.  Operating margin, 
as a result of the above, decreased by 2 points to 13% whilst operating profit decreased by 8% to 
EUR658.6m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 3% to EUR5,036.7m primarily due to strong ancillary revenues and a 
3% increase in traffic to 81.7m, offset by a 4% reduction in average fares, due to the timing of Easter, 
the weakening of sterling to the euro, the summer heat wave in Northern Europe, the adverse impact of the 
June French ATC strike, and an 8% fall in average fares in H2.
 Total revenue per passenger remained flat as strong growth in ancillary revenues and traffic was offset 
by the fall in average fares.
 Scheduled passenger revenues fell by 1% to EUR3,789.5m due to a 3% increase in traffic, offset by the 4% 
fall in average fares, due to the timing of Easter, the weakening of sterling to the euro, the summer heat 
wave, the June French ATC strike, and an 8% fall in average fares in H2. Load factor increased by 1 point 
to 83%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 17% to EUR1,247.2m, significantly faster than the 3% increase in traffic, 
due to a combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network, and 
higher administration and credit card fees.
 Total operating expenses increased by 5% to EUR4,378.1m due to the 7% rise in fuel costs and increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the 
euro.
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 7% to EUR2,013.1m due to higher euro fuel prices and the increased level of 
activity in the period.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 1% to EUR617.2m, due to the 2% increase in sectors flown, 
increased charges in Spain, a quadrupling of Italian ATC charges during the summer, offset by the mix of 
new routes and bases launched and the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Route charges rose by 7% to EUR522.0m due to the increased number of sectors flown and higher unit 
charges.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
 Staff costs increased by 6% to EUR463.6m primarily due to the increased level of activity and a 2% pay 
increase granted in April 2013, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR351.8m due to higher flight hours operated, the 
increase in the average number of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this year (March 31, 2014: 246) compared 
to the prior year (March 31, 2013: 242), and spare engines purchased during the year.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, decreased by 3% to EUR192.8m, due 
to reduced marketing spend per passenger and lower ancillary revenue costs.
 Maintenance costs decreased by 4% to EUR116.1m, primarily due to improved terms on lease extensions, 
offset by costs arising from the increased level of activity. The prior year comparative included 
additional costs associated with the handback of leased aircraft.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 3% to EUR101.5m, due to the negative impact of currency movements and 
higher lessor financing costs.
 Operating margin decreased by 2 points to 13% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits 
have decreased by 8% to EUR658.6m.
 Finance expense decreased by 16% to EUR83.2m primarily due to lower interest rates and reduced debt 
levels compared to the year ended March 31, 2013.
 Finance income decreased by 40% to EUR16.5m due to lower interest rates and gross cash balances, 
partially offset by increased dividend income from Aer Lingus received in the year.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash decreased by EUR317.3m since March 31, 2013 to EUR3,241.7m and gross debt fell by EUR414.7m to 
EUR3,083.6m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR1,044.6m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR505.8m, a EUR481.7m share buy-back programme and debt repayments.  As a result the Group 
had net cash of EUR158.1m at period end (March 31, 2013: EUR60.7m).
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR13.2m in the period to EUR3,285.8m primarily due the net profit 
after tax of EUR522.8m, offset by a EUR481.7m share buy-back and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment 
for derivatives.

 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 Financial risk factors
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2013 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Company's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2014 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year to March 31, 2014, there were 
no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy 
used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2014 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the year to March 31, 
2014 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

 These condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements ("the preliminary financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2013 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2013, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2013, are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2013 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group 
Accounts) Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 
31, 2013, together with the independent auditor's report thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar 
of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's 
Website.  The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified.

 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.        Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2014 
was 11.6% (March 31, 2013: 12.5%).  The tax charge for the year ended March 31, 2014 of EUR68.6m (March 
31, 2013: EUR81.6m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.         Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.9m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.         Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.          Capital commitments
 At March 31, 2014 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 297 (2013: 305) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  Following 
shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, the Group has agreed to purchase 175 new Boeing 737 800NG 
aircraft between fiscal 2015 and 2019. The Company also agreed on April 30, 2014, to purchase a further 5 
Boeing 737 800NG for delivery in fiscal 2016, bringing the total order to 180 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR221.2m at March 31, 2013 to EUR260.3m at 
March 31, 2014 is comprised of a gain of EUR39.1m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013 to EUR1.64

 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

13.     Share buy-back
 In the year ended March 31, 2014 the Company bought back 69.5m ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR481.7m. This is equivalent to approximately 4.8% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 
2013.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled. Accordingly, share capital decreased by 69.5m 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.4m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.4m.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1.0 billion to shareholders over the 
following two years. At March 31, 2014 EUR481.7m has been completed via share buybacks and the balance (in 
either special dividends or share buybacks) is to be completed in the fiscal year to March 31, 2015 
(subject to profitability and shareholder approval at the AGM).
 14.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the year ended March 31, 2014 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2013 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.     Post balance sheet events
 On April 30, 2014, the Company agreed to purchase a further 5 Boeing 737 800NG for delivery in fiscal 
2016, bringing the total number of aircraft to be purchased from Boeing to 180 for delivery between fiscal 
2015 and 2019.

 FITCH RATE RYANAIR HIGHEST AIRLINE IN THE WORLD
 FITCH'S BBB+ MATCHES S&P'S BBB+ RATING
 Ryanair Holdings Plc today (16 May) confirmed that it has received a BBB+ rating from Fitch, which matches the 
BBB+ rating recently awarded by Standard & Poor's, making Ryanair the highest rated airline in the world. These 
ratings reflect the strength of Ryanair's business model which has a long established track record of profitability, 
cash generation, and a very strong balance sheet with low levels of debt.
 Ryanair has undertaken these ratings reviews (with Citibank as advisors) as part of its plan to access capital 
markets to source low cost financing for its new 180 Boeing 737-800 aircraft deliveries, which commence in 
September 2014 and will enable Ryanair to grow by 40% over the next 5 years from 80m to over 112m p.a.
 Ryanair's CFO & Deputy CEO Howard Millar said:
 "We are pleased with the Fitch rating of BBB+, our second in as many months, following Standard & Poor's BBB+ 
rating, which makes Ryanair the highest rated airline in the world and reflects the financial strength of Ryanair's 
business model.
 The successful achievement of these BBB+ ratings is part of our plan to access capital markets for low cost 
finance to purchase our 180 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. These BBB+ ratings will enable Ryanair to achieve lower 
cost financing to ensure that we continue to have the lowest costs and offer the lowest fares in Europe for our 
customers."

 Jupiter Dividend & Growth Trust PLC
 Interim Management Statement for the three months ended 31 March 2014
 The Board of Jupiter Dividend & Growth Trust PLC (the "Company") is pleased to announce its interim 
management review for the quarter ended 31 March 2014.
 The following report relates to the performance of the Company's investment portfolio in the three months leading 
up to 31 March 2014.
 Investment Manager's Report for the Quarter Ended 31 March 2014
 Manager's Review
 Global equity markets were volatile in January as the US Federal Reserve began tapering its bond purchases. 
Emerging market equities and currencies were badly hit as those investors who had previously been seeking high 
yields in the developing world adjusted their portfolios. This was exacerbated by a contraction in Chinese 
manufacturing. Markets largely bounced back towards the end of February, but escalating conflict in Ukraine raised 
geopolitical tensions and subdued global markets in March.
 Plus500 and AstraZeneca performed particularly well over the past quarter. Plus500 offers an online trading 
platform for CFDs (contracts for difference) to the retail market. The shares have more than quadrupled since listing 
in 2013 as earnings have repeatedly far exceeded analyst estimates and the group is committed to paying out a 
high proportion of earnings as dividends. AstraZeneca shares have responded to optimistic medium term revenue 
guidance from management and some positive data relating to new cancer drugs under development.
 Not holding Rolls Royce, Barclays or Pearson benefited relative performance against the FTSE All Share, as these 
all reported highly disappointing earnings. Majestic Wine was among the worst performing holdings of the quarter. 
The wine retailer issued a profit warning after unexpectedly low February sales.
Jupiter Dividend & Growth Trust PLC Interim Management Statement
 We built new positions in ITV, which has significant exposure to the UK recovery, and Ryanair, which has unveiled 
a number of new self-help initiatives to improve revenue yields and further reduce costs for what is, in our view, 
Europe's most efficient airline. We note that ongoing sterling strength poses a risk to the performance of our 
holdings with international exposure and have exited positions in Spirax-Sarco and Halma to mitigate this.
 In our view, companies have not yet delivered the earnings increases needed across the board to justify some of 
the share price rises seen in 2013. While much of the backwards-looking economic data has been negative, 
forward-looking indicators of potential economic growth have remained positive, in our view. In this uncertain 
environment, we continue to believe it likely that there will be a growing premium for companies that can deliver 
positive performance, especially where accompanied by consistent and growing dividends to investors.

 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
 The objective of the Company is to provide Ordinary Income and Common shareholders with a high and rising 
income together with the possibility of capital appreciation and to provide Zero Dividend Preference and Common 
shareholders with a predetermined level of capital growth.
 INVESTMENT POLICY
Jupiter Dividend & Growth Trust PLC Interim Management Statement
 The investment policy of the Company is to invest mainly in a portfolio of UK listed equities, UK equity-related 
securities (such as convertible securities, preference shares, convertible unsecured loan stock, warrants and other 
similar securities) and UK xed interest securities.
 The equities selected as suitable for the portfolio will generally be those judged to be lowly valued by the 
Investment Manager, typically offering an attractive dividend yield with sufficiently strong cash generation from their 
operational activities to grow the dividend to shareholders over a number of years. Such equities are likely to be 
considered by the Investment Manager to be undervalued by the stock market at the time of purchase and will offer 
scope for capital gains.
 The portfolio manager selects each stock on its individual merits as an investment rather than replicating the 
relevant company's weighting within its benchmark, the FTSE All Share index. The portfolio is therefore unlikely to 
represent the constituents of its benchmark, but instead is intended to offer a well diversi ed investment strategy 
focussed on maximising returns from the prevailing economic background.

 RYANAIR BUYS 5 MORE BOEING 737-800 AIRCRAFT
 NEW ORDER INCREASES FROM 175 TO 180 UNITS, WITH 4 IN 2015 & 1 IN 2016
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (30 Apr) confirmed that it has agreed to buy 5 more 737-800 
series aircraft directly from Boeing, 4 of which will be delivered in early Summer 2015, with the 5(th) in February 
2016, in a deal which increases Ryanair's order book from 175 to 180 new Boeing aircraft.  These 5 new aircraft 
brings the value of Ryanair's order book to over $16 billion at current list prices.  Ryanair will now take 21 aircraft 
deliveries (up from 17) between September 2014 and July 2015, which will enable the airline to open more routes 
and additional frequencies on existing routes for Summer 2015.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
 "We are delighted that our partners Boeing have identified 5 new aircraft slots (4 of them before the 2015 Summer 
peak), which allows Ryanair to increase our order book from 175 to 180 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. These new 
Boeing aircraft enable Ryanair to keep the fleet average age below 5 years, while providing our customers with 
unmatched punctuality, reliability and an improved customer experience. Now that we have 4 more aircraft (21 in 
total) for Summer 2015, Ryanair will offer more new routes and increased frequencies to more customers than ever 
before."
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, Ray Conner, said:
 "Ryanair and Boeing share a relationship that spans 20 years. We are honoured that in that time Ryanair has 
become the largest 737-800 customer in the world - and with today's announcement have a backlog of 180 
airplanes on order. The 737-800 is recognized for its reliable operating performance and will provide Ryanair 
passengers with the flexibility they need for their low-cost travel."

 RYANAIR TO CREATE 200 NEW TECHNOLOGY & DIGITAL JOBS,
 AS AN TAOISEACH OPENS NEW DUBLIN OFFICE CAMPUS
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (3 April) announced plans to create 200 new jobs here in Ireland, primarily for 
technology, software development and digital marketing specialists, as An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and Minister for 
Finance, Michael Noonan, joined Ryanair Chairman, David Bonderman to officially open Ryanair's new 100,000 
sq.ft Dublin office campus in Airside Business Park, Swords.
 Ryanair confirmed that in the coming year (to March 2015) its traffic will grow from 81.5m to over 84m passengers, 
as it opens new bases in Lisbon, Athens, Brussels, Rome and significantly expands its route network from Dublin 
and London Stansted airports.  In addition to creating 500 new jobs for pilots, engineers and cabin crew in 2014, 
Ryanair will now create a further 200 jobs in its new Dublin offices, to develop its improved Ryanair.com digital 
platform (which will be released to the public later today) as well as its new mobile app at  end June.
 Ryanair's Chairman David Bonderman said today:
 "I want to personally welcome An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny and Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan to Ryanair's 
new Dublin office campus.  These are exciting times as we return to strong traffic growth to/from Ireland as a direct 
result of the Irish Government's foresighted decision to scrap the travel tax from 1 April.  The repeal of this tax has 
directly led Ryanair to open 21 new routes to Ireland in 2014, as well as increasing frequencies on over 30 other 
routes, in an expansion that will add more than 1.1m passengers at Dublin, Shannon and Knock airports, and will 
create over 1,000 new jobs in Irish tourism in 2014.
 Ryanair sees the decision to scrap the travel tax as a welcome policy development by Mr Kenny's government, 
which will enable Ireland's airline/tourism industry to grow strongly, and it has certainly encouraged Ryanair to 
invest in, and help create, thousands of new jobs here in Ireland in 2014.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO CREATE 200 NEW TECHNOLOGY&DIGITAL JOBS
 I am excited by Ryanair's growth prospects, as we take delivery of another 175 aircraft from our partners Boeing.  
We look forward to welcoming these 200 new people to Ryanair's new Dublin office campus, where they will join a 
team which continues to show that Ireland leads the world airline industry and will continue to do so for years to 
come."
 An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny said:
 ""I am delighted to be here to open Ryanair's new office campus and welcome the creation of 200 new jobs.  This 
Government's top priority is to get Ireland working again.  From an early stage, we have targeted tourism as a key 
driver of economic recovery and I am pleased to say budgetary measures such as the 9% VAT rate and the more 
recent cutting of the travel tax to zero have been welcomed by the industry which has responded by delivering new 
jobs and routes.
 The Government will continue, through the Action Plan for Jobs, to build on the 61,000 jobs created last year. I 
commend Ryanair for delivering on their promises and for their commitment to Ireland.  I wish them well as they 
continue to grow their business in a competitive global market."

 RYANAIR MARCH TRAFFIC FALLS 200,000 (-4%) TO 5.2M CUSTOMERS
 LOAD FACTOR UP 1% - 81.7M CUSTOMERS CARRIED IN 12 MONTHS (+3%)
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (3 Apr) released its March traffic statistics as 
follows:
 --    Traffic fell by 200,000 to 5.2m customers (down 4%)
 --    Load factor increased 1% to 80%.
 --    Annual traffic to March 2014 rose to a record 81.7m customers (up 3%).

 Load Factor    79%     80%     +1%        83%
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "Ryanair traffic fell by 200,000 to 5.2m customers in March as previously guided, due to the movement of Easter 
into April (from March last year). Ryanair's load factor increased by 1% as customers continue to enjoy our lowest 
fares, easier to use website and recent improvements in customer service including allocated seating and a free 
second small carry-on bag.
 Forward bookings for the summer months continue to grow strongly as Ryanair continues to give our customers 
the lowest fares and a much improved customer experience."

In Dublin, Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair is the first Irish carrier to launch its Dublin 2014 winter schedule, with 7 new routes to 
Basel, Bucharest, Cologne, Lisbon, Marrakesh, Nice and Prague, as well as increased frequencies on 21 
business routes, all of which go on sale on the Ryanair.com website from today.
 Our 7 new Dublin routes with multiple daily frequencies are ideal for business passengers or families 
booking their winter sun or ski getaway. Ryanair customers can also enjoy our recent customer service 
improvements including a 2(nd) free carry-on bag, allocated seating and the use of portable electronic 
devices, with further improvements to be rolled out over the coming months.
 To celebrate our Dublin 2014 winter schedule and the launch of these 7 new routes, we are releasing 
100,000 seats on sale from EUR19.99 for travel in April and May, which are available for booking until 
midnight Monday (24 Mar). Since these low prices will be snapped up quickly, we urge passengers to book 
them immediately on www.ryanair.com."
 Minister for Transport, Tourism & Sport, Leo Varadkar said:
 "This is yet more good news from Ryanair following the Government's decision to remove the Air Travel Tax 
from April. The airline has really embraced the opportunity presented by Budget 2014 and is offering 
thousands of new seats into Ireland, on top of those already announced for Dublin, Shannon and Knock.
 The new Cologne route will be useful for business while extra routes are being offered from a host of 
existing destinations into Dublin. My Department is already working with Tourism Ireland and Ryanair to 
promote the additional services."
 Dublin Airport Managing Director, Vincent Harrison said:
 "We are delighted that Ryanair is further expanding its winter schedule at Dublin Airport. These 7 new 
winter routes, as well as increased frequencies on 21 existing services, further enhances Dublin Airport's 
attractiveness for both business and leisure passengers.
 Dublin Airport has had a very strong start to the year, with passenger numbers up 9% for the first two 
months and these extra winter services from Ryanair will help underpin that growth and continue it into 
next year.
 Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport increased significantly faster than the European average last year, 
and we are continuing to outperform our European peers in 2014. These new winter short-haul routes from 
Ryanair and extra flights on existing services will provide extra options for our customers for the winter 
season, which begins in late October."

 RYANAIR IS HIGHEST RATED AIRLINE IN THE WORLD BY STANDARD AND POOR'S
 EUR70M SHARE BUYBACK COMPLETED
 Ryanair Holdings Plc today (20 Mar) announced that it received a BBB+ rating (modified from a-) from 
Standard & Poor's making it the highest rated airline in the world.  This rating reflects the fundamental 
strength of Ryanair's business model which has delivered a track record of high levels of profitability, 
superior cash generation, and a very strong balance sheet with low levels of leverage.  Ryanair has 
undertaken the rating process (with Citibank as advisors) as part of its plans to access capital markets 
to source secured and unsecured debt financing for its new 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft order.
 Ryanair has also completed a EUR70m systematic share buyback programme announced in December 20, 2013 
bringing the total share buybacks in FY14 to EUR484m.
 Ryanair's CFO & Deputy Chief Executive Howard Millar said:
 "We are very pleased with the Standard & Poor's rating of BBB+ (modified from a-), which makes Ryanair 
the highest rated airline in the world and reflects the financial strength of Ryanair's business model. 
The successful achievement of this BBB+ rating is part of our plan to access the capital markets to 
finance the purchase of our 175 Boeing 737-800 order via both secured and unsecured debt offerings.  The 
BBB+ rating will enable us to achieve lower cost financing to ensure that we continue to have the lowest 
costs and the lowest fares in Europe.
 The completion of our EUR70m systematic share buyback programme announced in December brings the total 
share buybacks completed in FY14 to EUR484m significantly ahead of our original EUR400m target".

Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LAUNCHES LONDON 2014 WINTER SCHEDULE
 To celebrate our Stansted winter 2014 schedule and 8 new routes, we are releasing 100,000 seats on sale 
from GBP19.99 for travel in April and May, which are available for booking until midnight Thursday (20 
Mar). Since these low prices will be snapped up quickly, we urge passengers to book them immediately on 
www.ryanair.com."
 London Stansted Managing Director, Andrew Harrison, said:
 "Today's announcement is fantastic news for Stansted. Ryanair is a very valued customer and the boost to 
next winter's schedules, including new destinations and increased frequencies on key routes, gives leisure 
and business passengers even greater choice at great value and builds on the strength of Ryanair's 
extensive network here at Stansted, their largest base in Europe.
 M.A.G. acquired Stansted to unlock its full potential and return the airport to sustained growth.  We're 
making excellent progress with our GBP80m investment to transform the terminal building and the new 
security search area - double the size of the previous - is already open for business and work is now 
underway to transform services and facilities for passengers in the departure lounge.
 Ryanair passengers are already benefiting from customer service improvements including a second free bag 
and allocated seating with more changes to come. Ryanair is changing, Stansted is changing and today's 
announcement is further evidence that we are succeeding in transforming Stansted under our new ownership."

 RYANAIR PARTNERS WITH TRAVELPORT
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (11 Mar) announced a new partnership with 
Travelport, a leading distribution services and e-commerce provider for the global travel industry, 
allowing Travelport-connected agents worldwide access to Ryanair's low fares and comprehensive route 
network.
 The combination of Ryanair's low fares, extensive route network at primary and secondary airports, and No 
1 or No 2 market share in most of Europe's major travel markets, will enable Ryanair and Travelport to 
deliver a significant business travel platform, and allow Europe's largest businesses to save both time 
and money by flying Ryanair. This significant partnership follows recent technology developments from 
Travelport making it the ideal partner for Ryanair to target the travel industry channel.
 Ryanair continues to improve both its customer experience and offering and this partnership with 
Travelport, and the launch of a dedicated Ryanair group travel service, are the latest in a programme of 
developments, with a new business product set to be unveiled in the summer, along with a fully revamped 
Ryanair website, a brand new app and mobile boarding passes.
 In London, Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said:
 "This partnership with Travelport is a significant development for Ryanair and for businesses across 
Europe and beyond as we continue to evolve our business offering. As Europe's largest airline, we'll carry 
over 81.5m customers this year on the largest route network, connecting 186 airports in 30 countries.
 More than 22% of these customers already choose Ryanair for business travel and we expect that percentage 
to grow as this partnership allows corporate travel departments and businesses even greater access to 
Ryanair's low fares and routes, ensuring they save millions of euro in travel expenses every year."
 Travelport's Executive Vice President & Chief Commercial Officer, Kurt Ekert said:
 "We're excited that Europe's largest low fares airline has selected Travelport as its partner and is 
fully embracing what we can uniquely offer through our industry-leading airline distribution technology. 
We look forward to working together to help Ryanair achieve its business ambitions and extend its 
extensive choice of low fares to travel agency customers worldwide."
 Ends.

 RYANAIR SEEKS INJUNCTION TO PREVENT SIPTU AIRPORT SHUTDOWN
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (7 Mar) was granted leave to seek a High Court injunction 
against SIPTU's plan to shut down Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports for four hours next Friday (14 Mar, 
between 05:00 and 09:00hrs).
 Ryanair will not allow over 13,000 of its customers to be blackmailed by greedy SIPTU unions, 
particularly in the case of Aer Lingus where there is a defined contribution pension scheme and these 
staff have already received over EUR600m in pay-offs, pension top ups and free shares over the past 8 
years. SIPTU's attempt to shut down air access from the country's three main airports is unlawful, 
unnecessary and unfair to passengers.
 Ryanair is taking legal action to protect our 13,000 plus customers who could have their travel plans 
rescheduled by SIPTU strikes next Friday. In the event that the strike goes ahead Ryanair will make every 
effort to minimise the disruption to our customers who will be contacted early next week with details of 
any rescheduling of their flights.
 Ryanair calls on the Dept. of Transport to explain what contingency plans the Government will put in 
place to prevent Ireland's vital airports being closed by SIPTU if this legal action is unsuccessful. Is 
the Government planning to call in the Gardaí and the army to keep airport security and fire services open 
next Friday? If not, why not?
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "Ryanair today took legal action to prevent SIPTU from shutting down Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports 
for four hours on Paddy's weekend. SIPTU's action is unlawful, unfair to our customers and an unnecessary 
burden on this island economy. Ryanair calls on the Government to outline its contingency plans to keep 
Ireland's vital airports open and prevent the travelling public being blackmailed by SIPTU."

UK Competition Appeal Tribunal rejects Ryanair's challenge to the Competition Commission's decision forcing 
Ryanair to sell-down minority stake in Aer Lingus
Dublin & London, 7 March 2014: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes today's decision by the UK 
Competition Appeal Tribunal ("CAT") rejecting Ryanair's appeal against the UK Competition Commission's ("CC") 
decision that Ryanair must sell down its 29.82% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%.
On 28 August 2013 the CC issued its Final Report concluding its investigation into Ryanair's minority shareholding 
in Aer Lingus. Following a detailed investigation the CC found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus is anti-
competitive and that it must sell down its 29.82% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%. The CC's Final Report also limits 
Ryanair's ability to re-acquire shares.
Ryanair appealed the CC's Final Report on a number of grounds, all of which have been rejected by the CAT today.
This decision represents the latest in an even longer line of judgments adverse to Ryanair in its attempts to prevent 
the UK competition authorities reviewing its minority shareholding in Aer Lingus.
Colm Barrington, Chairman of Aer Lingus, said:
"Today's CAT judgment is a key milestone on the path toward removing Ryanair from the Aer Lingus share 
register."

 We work hard to understand and meet our customers' needs. Customer surveys, panels and focus groups 
inform our actions and customer satisfaction is strong across the Group:
 --    Alsa was rated the best transport company in Spain for customer excellence. It successfully 
retained its urban contract in Palencia on renewal and was awarded new contracts in Tangiers and 
Guadalajara. Against the backdrop of a tough economic environment, our customer recommendation rate 
increased by five percentage points to 87%.
 --    North America School Bus achieved 92% customer satisfaction, up from 82% in 2012, reaping the 
benefits of our local focus on service delivery and improved key account management.
 --    Both UK Bus and UK Coach deployed customer technology in response to changing customer 
expectations. Over 100,000 people have now downloaded the National Express West Midlands app, whilst coach 
travellers can follow their services real time. Coach customers can now buy tickets through a host of new 
distribution channels, including Ryanair and the Post Office.
 --    c2c has now been the best performing operator in the UK rail industry for a record-breaking two 
years continuously, with an annual punctuality measure of 96.9%.
 --    We invested over GBP80 million in net capital expenditure in 2013, adding over nearly 900 new 
vehicles across our operations in UK Bus, Spain and North America.
 We have built constructive partnerships with our key stakeholders. UK Bus has a partnership with Centro 
to 'Transform Bus Travel' in the West Midlands. This embraces a good relationship with our principal local 
authority, committing both sides to investment in fleet and road prioritisation, fair pricing, provision 
of customer real-time information and roll out of smartcards. Our town centre turnaround vehicle cleaning 
programme has driven customer satisfaction well above the network average.
 Where our performance fails to meet customer expectations, we have embedded structured solutions. UK Bus 
implemented automatic vehicle location to improve the consistency of services. Punctuality improved by 7% 
and our high frequency services in the Black Country are amongst the most punctual in the UK. Bus customer 
complaints are down a fifth. UK Coach created a programme to empower customer service staff at coach 
stations to resolve customer issues there and then, ensuring the customer gets safely to their destination 
in the event of service problems. In Morocco, we analysed the Agadir network which we started up in 2010 
and identified significant improvements which have better met customer needs and driven a 32% increase in 
total ridership.
 We deliver great value for money in our fares for passengers. UK Coach cut prices in 2012 and drove a 6% 
increase in volume. In 2013 we cut prices again, delivering a further 9% growth in passengers. In Spain, 
high speed rail, a competitor on 20% of our intercity coach routes, introduced substantial discounts in 
National Express Group PLC Final Results -3-
2013. We have responded by discounting coach fares and in 2014 we will invest further in yield management 
to improve the value we deliver. In UK Bus, our roll out of smartcard products allows customers to get 
even better value services.
 Cost efficiency
 We have grown core non-rail operating profit to GBP185.5 million in 2013 through revenue growth and cost 
efficiency. We have delivered GBP30 million of cost efficiency and synergy, a 2% reduction in our cost 
base, which was delivered through a structured review of all controllable costs. In future we will target 
to reduce annual costs by 1% in real terms; drive down costs through synergy, productivity and use of 
technology; reconfigure networks to deliver efficiency; and secure procurement savings. In 2013, 
achievements included:
 --    In North America we completed the successful integration of Petermann, securing annualised saving 
of $10 million through procurement, insurance and overhead savings. Our GPS-based 'Compass' system has 
matched driving time to payroll and customer invoicing, delivering $3 million of efficiencies. We are 
standardising processes at each customer service centre (CSC) to improve quality and efficiency and have 
centralised 'back office' processes.
 --    Alsa reduced network kilometres in Spain by 3% in 2013, showing the flexibility of the intercity 
coach model to reduce capacity to match lower passenger demand. In our Bilbao acquisition, completed in 
2012, improvements in scheduling, employee management and stakeholder relations have delivered a 
significant turnaround in performance.
 --    UK Bus delivered GBP9 million of efficiency savings to help mitigate headwinds from fuel prices, 
lower fuel duty rebates and the impact of pension accounting changes. This included reducing lost mileage 
by managing congestion using real time location information, together with savings in engineering, 
procurement and overhead costs.
 --    Alongside strong revenue growth, UK Coach delivered GBP7 million of cost savings, with an overhaul 
of the route network, consolidating routes and reducing some frequencies, whilst expanding new services 
such as at Luton Airport. Productivity in owned operations improved with the closure of the Crawley depot, 
whilst streamlining of third party operations produced efficiency gains for both ourselves and our 
partners.
 To strengthen operational excellence, we are implementing structured processes in each business using a 
recognised quality management framework. These frameworks also help us replicate our success in our 
existing businesses in new market opportunities. In 2013, c2c was awarded the maximum five star rating by 
the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM). This has been a key component of our success in 
delivering the UK's best performing franchise, whilst also being recognised in our German and UK rail 
bids.
 Our values
 We continue to support operational excellence through our focus on our core values - safety, customers, 
people and community. Employee engagement is strong across the Group, supported by formal training 
programmes such as 'Master Driver', which accredits drivers to key standards and provides non-monetary 
rewards for exceptional performance. North America reported a record level of 86% employee satisfaction, 
up for the third year in a row. I would personally like to acknowledge the efforts and commitment of our 
employees in helping to achieve our customer service and safety improvements. I am also delighted with the 
progress of our Community programmes, including 2,400 young people helped by our UK initiative to support 
the further education of disadvantaged students and a US$4 million commitment to community support in 
North America. We are proud to be the first company to sign the UK Government's Corporate Covenant that 
supports Armed Forces personnel, including helping their return to private sector employment.
 Safety remains the first priority in all our operations. Three years ago we introduced our 'Driving Out 
Harm' programme and we have made good progress in improving the Group's safety culture and incident rate. 
Over two years we have reduced safety incidents for which we are responsible by 50%. As we strive to 
improve our performance further, 2013 success has included:
 --    Recognition by the American National Standards Institute for safety in our school bus business, the 
first industry operator to achieve this;
 --    Record breaking low levels of employee lost time injuries (LTIs) for the Group, including a 38% 
reduction in UK Bus;
 --    A 34% reduction in Signals Passed at Danger (SPAD) at c2c;
 --    A major reduction in passenger incident claims, down 40% year-on-year in Coach and 9% in Spain;
 --    Over GBP1 million in insurance premium savings during the year.
 2. Superior cash and returns
 National Express is focused on cash generation. Our free cash flow pays dividends to shareholders, funds 
future growth and reduces debt.  A strong cash flow and improving return on the capital we invest in the 
business will drive better returns for our shareholders. Maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet 
gives us choices for the future.
 At the start of 2013 we set out our goals to drive superior cash and returns:
National Express Group PLC Final Results -3-
 --    To generate GBP125-150 million of free cash flow in 2013
 --    To maintain our gearing ratio at between 2 and 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA over the medium term, 
but to reduce our gearing to around 2 times at the end of 2014
 --    To improve our core non-rail ROCE from 10.6% that we achieved in 2012
 --    To achieve a 20% pre-tax return on assets ('ROA') in North America.
 We have been successful in 2013 in delivering against these goals. Our free cash flow was over GBP180 
million. The Group has now generated almost GBP600 million of free cash flow in the last four years. 
Working capital reduced by GBP31 million in 2013, as we further reduced contract receivables in Spain and 
North America. Group operating cash conversion was 129% of operating profit with the stand out performer 
North America, generating almost $200 million of operating cash flow, equivalent to repaying the cash cost 
of the Petermann acquisition in just a year.
 We reduced net debt in 2013 by GBP82 million to GBP746 million, a gearing ratio of 2.5 times EBITDA, with 
lower debt offsetting the loss of NXEA earnings in 2012. We continue to target a gearing ratio of around 
two times at the end of 2014.

 RYANAIR FIRST IRISH AIRLINE TO ALLOW
 PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES (PEDs) ON ALL FLIGHTS
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (6 Feb) confirmed that all Ryanair customers may - with 
immediate effect - use their PEDs (including tablets, smartphones, e-readers and MP3 players) for the 
entire duration of their flight, once these devices are switched to 'flight mode' and all safety 
demos/briefings are observed.
 This is the latest customer initiative introduced by Ryanair as it continues to improve its industry 
leading customer service, and follows the recent roll out of allocated seats for all customers, which was 
successfully introduced last Saturday (1 Feb).
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "Ryanair customers can now use their personal electronic devices at all stages of their flight, while 
they enjoy their allocated seats, our low fares and on-time arrivals. The IAA is one of the first 
regulatory authorities in the world to approve this measure and we wish to commend them for their 
initiative. We are working hard to improve our service to all customers and today's PED approval is the 
latest in a series of changes which we know our customers will love."

 RYANAIR REPORTS Q3 LOSS OF EUR35M IN LINE WITH GUIDANCE,
 TRAFFIC GROWS 6% TO 18M - FARES & UNIT COSTS FALL 9%,
 FULL YEAR PROFIT GUIDANCE OF EUR510M UNCHANGED
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline today (Feb 3) reported a Q3 Loss of EUR35m, in line with previous 
guidance. Traffic grew 6% to 18m passengers.  Revenue per passenger declined 6%, as strong ancillary revenue 
growth offset a 9% fall in fares.  Excluding fuel, sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 9%. Ryanair's full year profit 
guidance remains unchanged at approx. EUR510m.

 ----------------------  -------------  -------------  ---------
"Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
 "Our Q3 loss of EUR35m is in line with previous guidance and is entirely due to a 9% fall in ave fares 
and weaker sterling.  We responded to this weaker pricing environment last September with seat promotions 
and lower fares which stimulated traffic across all markets resulting in 6% growth in Q3, and a 1% rise in 
monthly load factors.  Ancillary revenues grew by 13%, significantly faster than traffic growth due to 
strong customer uptake of reserved seating, priority boarding, and higher credit card fees.  Excluding 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
fuel, Q3 sector length adjusted unit costs fell 9% as Ryanair continues to deliver industry leading cost 
control.
 New Routes and Bases
 Our new routes and bases are performing well this winter, albeit at weaker yields, as high fare 
competitors cut capacity and restructure.  In December we opened 4 new Italian bases in Rome (Fiumicino), 
Catania, Lamezia, and Palermo in response to concerns about Altalia and its high fare domestic routes.  We 
announced 4 new bases for spring 2014 at Brussels (Zaventem) which opens February 28, Athens and 
Thessaloniki (April 1) and Lisbon (April 2).  Advance bookings on these new routes are well ahead of 
expectations, with customers welcoming Ryanair's lower fare alternative.  We expect these new bases to 
provide substantial growth opportunities for Ryanair, particularly as we commence deliveries in September 
2014 of our new 175 Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft order.  Over the next 5 years, as Ryanair grows from 80m to 
over 110m customers p.a., we expect a substantial portion of this growth will be at primary airports, 
where high fare incumbents are financially weak and restructuring, and the remainder arising at secondary 
airports driven by attractive low cost growth incentives.
 Customer Service
 In Q3 Ryanair announced a series of initiatives to further improve our industry leading customer service.  
In addition to the lowest fares, the most on-time flights, and the youngest fleet, our customers are now 
enjoying, (i) a simpler easier to use website, (ii) a free small second carry-on bag, (iii) "quiet 
flights" in early morning and late evening, (iv) a 24 hour "grace period" to correct minor booking errors, 
(v) significantly reduced boarding card and airport bag fees, and (vi) a new service to cater for group 
and business travel across our extensive network.
 Last weekend Ryanair returned to allocated seats on all flights.  Ryanair customers can now select their 
preferred seats which reduces queues and eliminates stress at boarding gates.  Allocated seating enables 
customers to choose their preferred seats, be it aisle or window, front or back, up to 30 days prior to 
departure.  Those passengers who don't wish to pay a small EUR5 fee will have a seat allocated to them, at 
no charge, during the 7 days prior to departure.  The uptake of reserved and allocated seats has grown 
significantly in the last weeks of January, and it now appears that sales of reserved/allocated seats will 
exceed the revenue loss from cutting airport and bag fees.  This should enable Ryanair to deliver strong 
growth in ancillary revenues in FY15 during which we hope these customer service improvements will deliver 
stronger forward bookings and load factors.
 Digital & Distribution Strategy
 Ryanair is also implementing a total overhaul of our website and digital strategy.  This roll out started 
in November with a new, easier to use website, which reduced the booking process from 17 to 5 "clicks".  
In December we launched the "My Ryanair" customer registration service which allows passengers to securely 
store their personal and payment details and saves them time when making or managing their bookings and/or 
checking in online.  We are investing heavily in IT and web development, and expect to deliver a new 
improved website by the end of April which will be much more intuitive for our customers, allowing them to 
readily identify our lowest fares, our routes, our timetables, as well as enabling them to share our low 
fares with friends and family.
 We are also on target to roll out mobile boarding passes in April, a new business travel product by the 
end of May, and an industry leading mobile app (tailored for smart phones and tablets) by the end of June 
2014.
 In addition to these digital improvements, Ryanair is working to broaden our distribution base.  We are 
proud to be the first low fares airline to partner with Google's European "Flight Search" function, which 
is currently available in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Holland and Spain (with more countries to 
follow).  This partnership will enable millions of European consumers to access our 1,600 low fare routes 
and book Ryanair's lower fares every time they search for "cheap fares", or "low cost flights" on the 
Google "Flight Search" engine. We believe that Google's "Flight Search" engine will become the transparent 
price comparison site of choice for all passengers in Europe.  We are in active negotiations with a number 
of GDS suppliers, and hope, subject to the successful conclusion of these discussions and IT integration 
issues, that Ryanair's low fares and comprehensive route network will appear in one or more GDS channels 
by mid-year.  The combination of Ryanair's low fares, extensive route network at primary and secondary 
airports and No 1 or No 2 market share in most of Europe's major travel markets, will enable Ryanair to 
deliver a significant business travel platform, and allow Europe's largest businesses save both time and 
money by flying Ryanair.
 Fuel
 Ryanair is 90% hedged for FY14 at a cost of $980 per tonne (approx. $98 p.bl), we have taken advantage of 
recent oil prices and dollar weakness to extend our hedge position to 90% for FY15 at $960 per tonne 
(approx. $96 per barrel), which together with the benefit of our euro/ dollar hedging programme will 
deliver fuel cost savings of approx. EUR80m in 2015.
 Balance Sheet
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
 Our balance sheet is one of the strongest in the airline industry.  By the end of Q3 Ryanair had 
completed another EUR414m of share buybacks, and announced a systematic share buyback programme of EUR70m 
to be completed by the end of March bringing the total of buybacks for FY'14 to EUR484m, significantly 
ahead of our original EUR400m target.  We remain committed to returning a further EUR500m to shareholders 
via a mix of special dividend and some limited share buybacks by the end of FY'15.  This will bring the 
total funds returned to Ryanair shareholders since FY'08 to over EUR2.5 billion.
 Full Year Guidance.
 Market pricing remains soft but is no longer declining.  We reacted quickly to last autumn's weakness 
with a range of lower fares, seat promotions, and recently increased advertising and marketing spend.  As 
a result forward bookings in Q4 and into FY'15 are running significantly ahead of last year, albeit at 
weaker yields.  We expect our strategy of lowering fares and increasing forward bookings will enable us to 
better manage close in bookings and yields as we move into summer 2014.   Thanks also to the earlier 
launch of new bases in Italy and Brussels (Zaventem), and rising load factors we expect FY'14 traffic to 
rise to 81.5m, slightly higher than previously guided.  Advance bookings for Q1 FY'15 are significantly 
higher than this year's comparable, even allowing for the impact of Easter.  Based on current visibility, 
we expect Q4 yields to decline by approx. 8%, slightly better than the 10% decline previously guided.  As 
full year traffic will be slightly stronger, and our focus on cost control delivers a 4% fall in Q4 (ex-
fuel) unit costs, we are now confident that the full year net profit outturn will finish in the range of 
EUR500m to EUR520m as previously guided.

Body
 Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy. Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and 
Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's favourite low fares airline, operating more than 1,600 daily flights (over 500,000 per year) from 
65 bases, across 1,600 low fare routes, connecting 186 destinations in 29 countries and operating a fleet of 300 
new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair has recently announced firm orders for a further 175 new Boeing aircraft, 
which will be delivered between 2014 and 2018. Ryanair currently has a team of more than 9,000 highly skilled 
professionals, will carry over 81.5 million passengers this year and has an outstanding 29-year safety record.

 Gross cash decreased by EUR734.1m since March 31, 2013 to EUR2,824.9m and gross debt fell by EUR308.6m to 
EUR3,189.7m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR322.4m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR366.7m, a EUR413.9m share buy-back programme and debt repayments.  As a result the Group 
had net debt of EUR364.8m at period end (March 31, 2013: net cash EUR60.7m).
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR91.9m in the period to EUR3,364.5m primarily due the net profit 
after tax of EUR566.7m, offset by a EUR413.9m share buy-back and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment 
for derivatives.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended December 31, 2013
 The Group had a Loss after tax of EUR35.2m compared to a profit after tax of EUR18.1m in the comparative 
period, a decline of EUR53.3m, primarily due to a 9% decrease in average fares and a 6% increase in total 
operating expenses, offset by strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic.  Total operating revenues 
were broadly in line with the comparative period at EUR964.4m primarily due to a 9% decrease in average 
fares, offset by a 13% rise in ancillary revenues and a 6% increase in passenger numbers. Average fares 
decreased by 9% compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2013 due to weaker market conditions and the 
weakening of sterling to the euro. Fuel, which represents 46% of total operating costs in the quarter, 
compared to 44% in the comparative period, increased by 10% to EUR455.0m due to a higher euro price per 
gallon paid and increased activity in the period. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 3% however, including 
fuel unit costs remained flat.  As a result of the above, there was an operating loss of EUR23.0m compared 
to an operating profit of EUR34.6m in the comparative quarter.
 Total operating revenues were broadly in line with the comparative period at EUR964.4m primarily due to a 
9% decrease in average fares, offset by strong ancillary revenues and a 6% increase in passenger numbers 
to 18.3m.
 Total revenue per passenger fell by 6%, primarily due to the lower average fares.
 Scheduled passenger revenues decreased by 4% to EUR715.2m primarily due to a 9% decrease in average fares 
(partly due to the weakening of sterling to the euro) offset by the 6% increase in passenger numbers. Load 
factor increased by 1 point to 82%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 13% to EUR249.2m, faster than the 6% increase in passenger numbers, due 
to a combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network and 
higher administration and credit card fees.
 Total operating expenses increased by 6% to EUR987.4m due to the 10% rise in fuel costs and increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the 
euro.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
 Staff costs increased by 5% to EUR105.1m due to the increased level of activity and the impact of a 2% 
pay increase granted in April 2013, offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 8% to EUR85.4m due to a combination of, the increased level of 
activity, the spare engines purchased in the period and the higher average number of 'owned' aircraft in 
the fleet this quarter (December 31, 2013: 246) compared to the prior year (December 31, 2012: 241).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 10% to EUR455.0m due to higher euro fuel prices and the increased activity 
in the quarter.
 Maintenance costs increased by 1% to EUR28.9m, primarily due to costs arising from the increased level of 
activity offset by improved terms on lease extensions.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 1% to EUR24.7m, reflecting the negative impact of adverse currency 
movements and higher financing costs.
 Route charges rose by 4% to EUR109.3m due to the increased number of sectors flown and higher unit 
charges.
 Airport & handling charges decreased by 1% to EUR135.0m, due to the increase in sectors flown, offset by 
the mix of routes and bases operated and the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, decreased by 3% to EUR44.0m, 
primarily due to a reduction in marketing spend per passenger, lower ancillary revenue costs and credit 
card processing fees.
 Due to the reasons outlined above operating losses are EUR23.0m compared to an operating profit of 
EUR34.6m in the comparative quarter.
 Finance income decreased by 50% to EUR2.4m due to lower interest rates and gross cash this quarter 
compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2012.
 Finance expense decreased by 13% to EUR20.8m primarily due to lower interest rates and gross debt this 
quarter compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2012.

 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length 
transaction between informed and willing parties, other than as part of a forced liquidation sale. The 
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the 
Company's financial instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at December 31, 2013 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at December 31, 2013 to arrive 
at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the nine months to 
December 31, 2013 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the nine months to December 31, 2013, 
there were no reclassifications of financial assets and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial statement of financial position, are as follows:

 In the nine months ended December 31, 2013 the Company bought back 59.6m ordinary shares at a total cost 
of EUR413.9m.  This is equivalent to approximately 4.2% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 
2013. All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled. Accordingly, share capital decreased by 59.6m 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.4m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.4m.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 In December 2013, the Company announced that it had entered into an irrevocable arrangement with its 
broker, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, to commence a share buyback programme to repurchase ordinary 
shares to a maximum value of EUR70.1m during the period December 20, 2013 to March 31, 2014.
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1.0 billion to shareholders over the next 
two years (subject to shareholder approval). At December 31, 2013 EUR413.9m has been completed and a 
further EUR66.8m will be completed prior to March 31, 2014, and up to a further EUR519.3m in either 
special dividends or share buybacks in the fiscal year to March 31, 2015.
 14.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the nine months ended December 31, 2013 that materially 
affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no 
changes in the related party transactions described in the 2013 Annual Report that could have a material 
effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.     Post balance sheet events
 During January 2014, the Company repurchased 4.5m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR29.6m. All 
ordinary shares repurchased are cancelled.

Body
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations in the nine months to December 31, 2013.
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of 
these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations.
 --      IAS 32 (amendment) "Financial instruments: Presentation-offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 36 (amendment) "Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 39 (amendment) "Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRIC 21 "Levies" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" (2009, as amended in 2011) (effective date to be determined).
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.       Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine months ended December 
31, 2013 was 11.9% (December 31, 2012: 12.2%).  The tax charge for the nine months ended December 31, 2013 
of EUR76.9m (December 31, 2012: EUR84.9) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary 
differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.        Share based payments
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -7-
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.5m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.        Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.        Capital commitments
 At December 31, 2013 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 298 (2012: 305) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  
Following shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, the Group has agreed to purchase 175 new Boeing 
737 800NG aircraft between fiscal 2015 and 2019.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR221.2m at March 31, 2013 to EUR204.1m at 
December 31, 2013 is comprised of a loss of EUR17.1m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the decrease in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013 to EUR1.28 
per share at December 31, 2013.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 11.     Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions
 Capital expenditure in the nine months amounted to EUR366.7m and is primarily aircraft pre delivery 
payments and the cost of spare engines purchased during the period.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 Financial risk factors
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 The quarters financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2013 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies since year-end.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Summary nine months ended December 31, 2013
 Profit after tax decreased by 8% to EUR566.7m compared to EUR613.7m in the nine months ended December 31, 
2012 primarily due to a 6% increase in total operating expenses and a 4% decrease in average fares, offset 
by strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic. Total operating revenues increased by 4% to 
EUR4,219.2m, primarily due to the 20% growth in ancillary revenues to EUR961.9m, significantly faster than 
the 3% increase in traffic, offset by a 4% reduction in average fare due to the summer heat wave, the 
weakening of sterling to the euro, the timing of Easter, the June French ATC strike and a 9% fall in 
average fares in Quarter 3. Total revenue per passenger, as a result, remained flat. Load Factor also 
remained the same at 84% compared to the period ended December 31, 2012.
 Total operating expenses increased by 6% to EUR3,525.0m, due to increased fuel prices and the higher 
level of activity. Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs compared to 46% in the comparative 
period, increased by 8% to EUR1,656.3m due to the higher euro price per gallon paid and increased activity 
in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 1% and including fuel they rose by 3%.  Operating 
margin decreased by 2 points to 16% whilst operating profit decreased by 7% to EUR694.2m.
 Net margin was down 2 points to 13%, compared to December 31, 2012.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 39.79 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 
42.56 euro cent at December 31, 2012.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash decreased by EUR734.1m since March 31, 2013 to EUR2,824.9m and gross debt fell by EUR308.6m to 
EUR3,189.7m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR322.4m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR366.7m, a EUR413.9m share buy-back programme and debt repayments.  As a result the Group 
had net debt of EUR364.8m at period end (March 31, 2013: net cash EUR60.7m).
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the nine months ended December 31, 2013
 Profit after tax decreased by 8% to EUR566.7m primarily due a 6% increase in total operating expenses and 
a 4% decrease in average fares, offset by strong ancillary revenue growth and increased traffic.  Total 
operating revenues increased by 4% to EUR4,219.2m primarily due to a 20% increase in ancillary revenues 
and a 3% rise in traffic offset by a 4% reduction in average fares.  Fuel, which represents 47% of total 
operating costs compared to 46% in the comparative period, increased by 8% to EUR1,656.3m due to a higher 
euro price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 
1%, including fuel unit costs rose by 3%.    Operating margin, as a result of the above, decreased by 2 
points to 16% whilst operating profit decreased by 7% to EUR694.2m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 4% to EUR4,219.2m primarily due to strong ancillary revenues and a 
3% increase in traffic to 67.4m, offset by a 4% drop in average fares, due to the timing of Easter, the 
weakening of sterling to the euro, the summer heat wave in Northern Europe, the adverse impact of the June 
French ATC strike and a 9% fall in average fares in Quarter 3.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
 Total revenue per passenger remained flat as the strong growth in ancillary revenues and passenger 
numbers was offset by the fall in average fares.
 Scheduled passenger revenues were broadly in line with the previous year at EUR3,257.3m due to a 3% 
increase in traffic, offset by the 4% fall in average fares, due to the timing of Easter, the weakening of 
sterling to the euro, the summer heat wave, the June French ATC strike and a 9% fall in average fares in 
Quarter 3. Load factor remained flat at 84%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 20% to EUR961.9m, significantly faster than the 3% increase in passenger 
numbers, due to a combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the 
network, and higher administration and credit card fees.
 Total operating expenses increased by 6% to EUR3,525.0m due to the 8% rise in fuel costs and increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the 
euro.
 Staff costs increased by 7% to EUR363.7m primarily due to an 8% increase in hours and a 2% pay increase 
granted in April 2013, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 8% to EUR267.7m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity, the higher average number of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this year (December 31, 2013: 246) 
compared to the prior year  (December 31, 2012: 241), and spare engines purchased in the period.
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 8% to EUR1,656.3m due to higher euro fuel prices and the increased level of 
activity in the period.
 Maintenance costs decreased by 4% to EUR82.8m, primarily due to improved terms on lease extensions, 
offset by costs arising from the increased level of activity. The prior year comparative included 
additional costs associated with the return of leased aicraft.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 7% to EUR77.3m, due to the negative impact of currency movements and 
higher financing costs.
 Route charges rose by 10% to EUR427.8m due to the increased number of sectors flown and higher unit 
charges.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 2% to EUR502.0m, due to the 3% increase in sectors flown, 
increased charges in Spain, a quadrupling of Italian ATC charges during the summer, offset by the mix of 
new routes and bases launched and the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, decreased by 8% to EUR147.4m, due 
to reduced marketing spend per passenger, lower ancillary revenue costs, and the reductions achieved in 
credit card processing fees.
 Operating margin decreased by 2 points to 16% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits 
have decreased by 7% to EUR694.2m.
 Finance income decreased by 42% to EUR14.2m due to lower interest rates and gross cash balances, 
partially offset by increased dividend income in the period.
 Finance expense decreased by 17% to EUR63.5m primarily due to lower interest rates and gross debt 
compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2012.

 New ISE service issues >1,000 codes to organisations worldwide
 --      Demand rises as 12th February deadline for regulatory reporting approaches
 --      ISE endorsed by international oversight body, the ROC as a pre-LEI provider
 Monday 3(rd) February 2014
 The Irish Stock Exchange's (ISE) has issued over 1,000 pre-Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) codes since 
launching its online application service through www.ISEdirect.ie last autumn. Demand is set to rise as 
some organisations need to have pre-LEIs for regulatory reporting purposes under European securities 
legislation which comes into effect on 12(th) February.
 LEI is a global reference code which uniquely identifies each legal entity that engages in a financial 
transaction. This regulatory initiative is designed to enable the identification and linking of parties to 
financial transactions and facilitates the better management of counterparty risk.
 Among the 1,000 codes issued, the ISE's customers includes well-known Irish brands such as Kingspan, 
Ryanair, Smurfit Kappa and the Musgrave Group, international banks like Morgan Stanley, national service 
providers such as RTE and ESB as well as a large range of investment funds and debt issuers, both listed 
on the ISE and elsewhere. In addition, some SMEs in Ireland that engage in foreign exchange transactions 
to manage currency risk have also been applying for codes.
 The geographic spread of the ISE's customer base for their new service extends far beyond Ireland and 
includes Australia, USA and Canada, the United Arab Emirates and a wide range of European countries - 
United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Italy.
 The LEI requirement is part of the international response by regulatory authorities to the global 
financial crisis. In December, the ISE was only the sixth organisation worldwide to be endorsed by the 
Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC), the global body of regulators which oversees adherence to the LEI 
standards. The Central Bank of Ireland, which has sponsored the ISE as the pre-LEI provider in Ireland, is 
a member of the ROC.
 James Ferguson, Head of Operations and LEI Lead said, "The ISE's user friendly and simple application 
process on            www.ISEdirect.ie has enabled us to attract entities, both existing and new 
customers. Based on customer feedback, we expect this strong interest in the ISE service to continue."
 Brian Healy, Director of Traded Markets, Development, Operations added, "We are delighted with the 
success of our pre-LEI service - having delivered over 1,000 pre-LEI codes to more than 20 jurisdictions 
Irish Stock Exchange ISE issues over 1000 pre-LEI codes worldwide
across the globe, the level of take-up is a real validation of the strength and quality of our offering 
and its international potential. The ISE has been at the forefront of the LEI initiative globally and our 
early endorsement by the Regulatory Oversight Committee re-enforces our expertise in this area."

EUR17.99 for travel in Feb and Mar, which are available for booking until midnight Monday (27 Jan).  
Ryanair's new Lisbon routes will begin in April and will go on sale on www.ryanair.com tomorrow.

 To celebrate Ryanair's new Lisbon base and 4 new routes, Ryanair is launching a seat sale with fares 
starting from EUR17.99 for travel across Europe in February and March, which are available for booking 
until midnight Monday (27 Jan). Since seats at these crazy low prices will be snapped up quickly, we urge

 RYANAIR PARTNERS WITH GOOGLE FLIGHT SEARCH
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (22 Jan) announced that its low fares are now 
available on Google Flight Search, allowing even faster access to its 1,600 routes and ensuring Google 
Flight Search users can see just how much cheaper Ryanair's fares are compared to every other European 
airline.
 Using Google Flight Search, customers in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain (as 
well as Canada and the USA) can quickly find and compare flights to and from any of Ryanair's 186 airports 
in Europe and North Africa, view prices in their local currency and then book these low fares directly 
with Ryanair.
 Google's Flight Search feature also allows users to:
 --    explore possible destinations and view live ticket prices by surfing on an interactive map
 --    browse and filter flights by price, airline, flight duration or date selector
 --    see a simple list of the most relevant flights, which are listed in order of price.
 Ryanair's partnership with Google Flight Search is the latest in a series of new digital innovations as 
Ryanair continues to improve its industry leading customer service, including a new Ryanair.com homepage 
and booking flow and a "My Ryanair" customer registration system, with mobile boarding passes, business 
and family products, a new mobile app and an entire Ryanair.com website overhaul to follow in the coming 
weeks and months.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to announce our partnership with Google Flight Search which will dramatically change 
how Europe's passengers select and book their flights. Customers can now view Ryanair's lowest fares on 
Google Flight Search, browsing by country, date or flight duration and can book these low fares directly 
on Ryanair.com through Google Flight Search. This is the latest digital innovation we have rolled out and 
will be followed in early 2014 by mobile boarding passes, an improved app and a brand new Ryanair.com 
website."
 Google's David Robles said:
 "Research suggests that users tend to visit around twenty different sites before they book a flight. 
Google wants to help improve the travel experience by drastically reducing the time wasted on researching 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR PARTNERS WITH GOOGLE FLIGHT SEARCH
and booking flights. Google Flight Search is fast, easy to use and interactive so business people, 
parents, and star crossed lovers can quickly pay for their travel and get back to their work, parenting or 
pining. We want to give users as many flight options as possible, so introducing Ryanair, which is 
Europe's largest airline, to the Google Flight Search family is very exciting."

 Irish Stock Exchange to launch dedicated exchange for aviation finance
 -      Creating a specialist debt listing platform to enhance Ireland's status as a global centre in 
aviation finance
 -      ISE already home to 26 aviation debt listings with a total value of $12.7 billion
 -      Initiative welcomed by industry participants including Boeing
 Monday, 20 January 2014
 The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) has announced plans to create a dedicated exchange for aviation-related 
debt and other instruments.
 The exchange will offer a highly efficient, low-cost platform delivering better visibility, greater 
investor reach and improved market intelligence.
 The announcement was made ahead of this week's 16th Annual Global Airfinance Conference 2014 in Dublin, a 
major aviation industry event that is being attended by over 1,000 senior aviation executives from around 
the world.
 26 specialist debt instruments with a total value of $12.7 billion are currently listed on ISE markets by 
issuers from the aviation industry. These include:
 Q a $927m EETC* from International Airlines Group (the parent of BA and Iberia)
 Q bonds totalling in excess of $1bn associated with Emirates Airlines
 Q a $636m Asset-Backed Security from Avolon (a commercial aircraft leasing company)
 Q In addition to debt instruments with a total value of $12.7 billion, the ISE is also home to equity 
listings for Ryanair and Aer Lingus
 *[EETC = enhanced equipment trust certificate - a specialist instrument to finance the purchase of 
aircraft]
 The dedicated platform aims to be an international hub for aviation finance assets creating a market that 
will be enhanced by specialist knowledge of the industry in Irish-based leasing, broking and corporate 
finance firms.
 ISE Chief Executive Deirdre Somers said:
 "Ireland is a world leader in aviation finance and the Irish Stock Exchange is a world leader in debt 
listings. We want to combine these skills to make Ireland even more attractive for aviation issuers and 
investors.
Irish Stock Exchange Dedicated Exchange for Aviation Finance
 We are creating a dedicated platform specialising in aviation-related debt instruments that will provide 
issuers and investors with what they are looking for - visibility and specialist knowledge of their 
sector."
 Ms Somers said Ireland is already the world's biggest centre for aircraft leasing, with more than half of 
aircraft leasing worldwide led by companies based here.
 "Ireland is home to more than 30 companies engaged in this high-value, high-skilled sector.  It is also 
home to two of Europe's best-known airlines in Ryanair and Aer Lingus. Investors and issuers around the 
world are familiar with Ireland's expertise in aviation and it makes sense to build on that," she said.
 The dedicated platform is expected to give greater visibility to Ireland's profile generally, and the ISE
 particularly,   in the aviation finance sector.
 The ISE has worked closely with Enterprise Ireland's Aviation Forum as well as stockbroking firms and 
aircraft leasing companies to advance plans for a dedicated exchange, and the initiative has been welcomed 
within the global aviation industry.
 Boeing expects the public capital markets where aircraft-backed financial instruments are traded to 
provide a fifth of the world's delivery financing in 2014.
 Kostya Zolotusky, Managing Director, Capital Markets Development and Leasing at Boeing Capital 
Corporation, the jet builder's financing and leasing unit, said:
 "Ireland's unique position at the epicentre of global aircraft leasing is well recognized."
 Boeing also expects new structured financial instruments will be developed to meet the needs of leasing 
firms and others.
 "We congratulate Ireland on recognizing that and we look forward to continued evolution and innovation in 
how aircraft-securities are packaged," said Mr Zolotusky.
 Joe Gill, Chairman of Enterprise Ireland's Aviation Forum and Director of Corporate Broking with Goodbody 
Stockbrokers, said:
 "With over $110bn of aircraft assets being delivered annually worldwide, the need for innovative funding 
by capital markets will only grow in line with an expanding aircraft leasing sector.
 Ireland can provide a valuable platform to connect retail and institutional investors with key aviation 
companies in this key financial services sector and Goodbody is committing resources in support of that 
ambition.
 The ISE is a flexible, efficient and competitive platform that can be used by issuers and investors alike 
to further develop this key transport infrastructure globally".
 Irish Aviation Authority Chief Executive Eamonn Brennan said:
 "It's estimated that the demand for new aircraft over the next 20 years will be in the region of US$3.5 
trillion to fund nearly 30,000 new aircraft worldwide. Ireland has a great opportunity to play a part in 
this market".
 Tom Woods, Head of Aviation Finance and Leasing at KPMG said:
 "Ireland continues to develop as an attractive environment for raising debt and equity. With the 
anticipated significant capital markets activity in the coming years to finance aircraft, this is a 
particularly opportune time for the ISE to launch this very welcome initiative."
 Catherine Duffy, Head of Aircraft Finance at A&L Goodbody said:
 "This initiative by the ISE will further bolster Ireland as the global centre of excellence for aircraft 
financing. Ireland is ideally placed to attract increased capital markets activity and therefore we very 
much welcome this development by the ISE."

 Notes to Editors
 --      Demand for commercial aircraft is valued at over $100bn in 2013. Record orderbooks imply that 
annual deliveries will exceed $100bn for each of the next ten years. Boeing predicts that aircraft 
deliveries in 2018 will amount to $139bn. Current orders among aircraft manufacturers equate to eight 
years of production.
 --      Financing for aircraft deliveries is primarily sourced from commercial banks, equity and debt 
investors. Capital markets are a growing source of funding for aircraft and accounted for $15bn or 15% of 
the total requirement in 2013. That compares with a share of just 4% in 2009.
 --      Leasing accounts for almost 40% of the commercial aircraft market annually, and has grown from a 
15% share in 1990.
Irish Stock Exchange Dedicated Exchange for Aviation Finance
 --      Aircraft leasing is growing in popularity among airlines because it offers a flexible and 
efficient finance structure to provide aircraft without the direct ownership costs and debt associated 
with acquiring aircraft.
 --      The top 50 aircraft leasing companies in the world have a combined fleet value of over $190bn and 
that is set to grow again in 2014.
 This announcement has been issued through the Companies Announcement Service of
 the Irish Stock Exchange.

 the CAA'S DEREGULATION OF STANSTED AIRPORT is MORE regulatory FAILURE that will harm consumers
 THE CAA PUTS THE FOXES IN CHARGE OF the CHICKEN COOP
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (10 Jan) criticised the UK CAA's false claim that Stansted 
airport does not have substantial market power, and the consequent deregulation of Stansted.  Against 
evidence and its own earlier findings, the CAA now inexplicably claims that airlines are able to exert 
buyer power on Stansted in circumstances where Stansted was allowed by the CAA to double its charges in 
2007, which caused a 5 year 27% traffic collapse at Stansted while Heathrow and Gatwick were growing.  
Even Easyjet moved flights to Southend to avoid Stansted's high charges.
 Today's deregulation decision by the CAA will allow Stansted to increase charges in future and will 
result in yet more damage to UK consumers and competition. This decision confirms yet again that the CAA's 
regulatory regime is "inadequate", as previously found by the Competition Commission in its 2009 decision 
to break up the BAA airport monopoly.
 Ryanair's Director of Legal & Regulatory Affairs, Juliusz Komorek said:
 "Ryanair regrets today's unsupported claim by the CAA that Stansted does not have substantial market 
power and the CAA's decision to deregulate Stansted.  The CAA's failure to recognise that Stansted has 
profitably maintained its prices above the competitive level since 2007, despite a 27% fall in traffic, 
confirms the Competition Commission's finding that the CAA regulatory regime is 'inadequate'.
 Today's decision is an example of the CAA's regulatory failure which will again harm consumers as 
Stansted will be able to further increase airport charges whenever it wishes, without any reference to 
competitive price levels.
 Effective regulation with aggressive price caps is the only way to ensure that consumers are protected 
and that Stansted can grow its traffic on a sustained basis.  Ryanair condemns the CAA's continuing 
failure to effectively regulate Stansted."

 RYANAIR CLOSES DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME
 ON 30(TH) DEC 2013
 SCHEME FULLY FUNDED & TOP UP AGREED WITH TRUSTEES
 FOR ALL 121 MEMBERS
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (9 Jan) confirmed that its Irish Defined Benefit Pension 
Scheme ("DB Scheme") was wound up by agreement with the Trustees on 30(th) December 2013.
 Following protracted negotiations with the Trustees, Ryanair agreed to fully fund a deficit of EUR9.7m 
and to pay an additional top up of EUR2.8m into the DB Scheme. The DB Scheme which has just 121 active 
members, currently covers less than 1.5% of Ryanair's over 9,000 strong team as it was closed to new 
members in January 2000, 14 years ago. All 121 active members of the DB Scheme are now able to join the 
Ryanair Defined Contribution Scheme ("DC Scheme") with effect from January 2014.
 Ryanair's Deputy CEO & CFO Howard Millar said:
 "With only 121 active members and a deficit of just under EUR10m, the Board of Ryanair believes that it 
is the appropriate time to wind up the DB Scheme. By fully funding the deficit, and providing an 
additional top up of EUR2.8m to enhance transfer values, Ryanair has effectively eliminated pension 
liabilities from its balance sheet.
 This is in marked contrast to many of our competitor airlines, whose pension schemes are running enormous 
deficits, in excess of hundreds of millions or billions.
 All active members of the Ryanair DB Scheme now have certainty that there is no deficit in the scheme as 
at 30(th) December 2013, and they will enjoy the benefits of the additional top up, which will enhance 
their transfer values.  Going forward, all of these 121 individuals are free to join the Ryanair DC 
Scheme."

 Note to Editors
 Now that the Ryanair DB Scheme has been fully funded and topped up, Ryanair looks forward to hearing from 
IALPA, BALPA, and other pilot unions as to what they are doing about the enormous deficits which they 
continue to preside over in the pension schemes of many of Ryanair's competitor airlines.

 RYANAIR OPENS 3 NEW ROME DOMESTIC ROUTES,
 & ALLOCATES 6 AIRCRAFT TO A ROME FIUMICINO BASE
 RISING TO 12 BASED AIRCRAFT IN SEPT 2014
 Ryanair, Italy's No.1 airline today (26(th) Nov) announced that it would respond to the numerous requests 
it had received from Southern Italian airports by allocating 6 aircraft to a new base in Rome Fiumicino 
Airport, and launching 3 new Southern Italy domestic routes with multiple daily flights to Catania and 
Palermo (in Sicily) and Lamezia (in Calabria) with these daily flights commencing on Wed 18(th) December 
next.  Ryanair also confirmed the 6 aircraft allocated to this new Rome Fiumicino base will also offer 
daily business flights to Brussels (Zaventum) and Barcelona (El Prat).
 These 3 new domestic routes from Rome Fiumicino will bring to 9 the no. of domestic routes served by 
Ryanair from Rome, (as Alghero, Bari, Brindisi, Cagliari, Comiso and Trapani are already served from Rome 
Ciampino). Ryanair confirmed that over the next 12 months, it will move many of these Italian domestic 
routes from Ciampino to Fiumicino which will be its main airport for domestic services to/from Rome.  This 
will free up slots at Rome Ciampino thereby enabling Ryanair to add more international flights and more 
new routes to its schedule at Rome Ciampino, the preferred Rome airport for travellers to/from 
international destinations.
 Starting in just under four weeks time, Ryanair's daily services from Rome Fiumicino to Catania (5 times 
daily), Palermo (4 times daily) and Lamezia (2 times daily) will start at fares from just EUR49 one way 
(incl. all taxes and charges) which will be more than one third cheaper than Alitalia's lowest fares on 
these domestic routes which currently start at EUR75 one way.
 Ryanair also confirmed that it will increase these daily frequencies if Alitalia cuts back.  Ryanair has 
also offered to use its low fare flights to feed into Alitalia's international network to/from Rome 
Fiumicino. Ryanair has for example offered to carry Alitalia passengers at one-way fares from just EUR50 
which will enable Alitalia to significantly reduce the costs of its feed traffic on these domestic routes 
to Rome Fiumicino. Ryanair has also requested a meeting with Alitalia to examine any other opportunities 
which may exist for co-operating with and assisting Alitalia in its current restructuring.
 Speaking in Rome, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
 "We are pleased to increase our domestic operation from 6 to 9 routes from Rome, with high frequency 
daily services from Rome Fiumicino to Catania, Lamezia and Palermo.  We are also pleased to open a 6 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR OPENS 3 NEW ROME DOMESTIC ROUTES
allocated aircraft base in Rome Fiumicino from December 18(th) to establish what will grow to be a large 
domestic base, which will create opportunities for Ryanair to significantly expand its international 
routes and frequencies at our principal Rome (Ciampino) airport.  This Fiumicino base will increase from 6 
to 10 or 12 allocated aircraft from October 2014, when Ryanair takes delivery of its next new aircraft 
orders from Boeing.
 Since Ryanair is Italy's No. 1 airline, it is important that we respond to our airport partners, who are 
looking to ensure that they have secure domestic routes and feed to/from Rome Fiumicino, particularly as 
Alitalia continues to restructure.  Ryanair will guarantee that connectivity to Rome and to Southern Italy 
will be maintained regardless of Alitalia's plans to reduce capacity on domestic routes.
 We hope Alitalia will take up our offer to co-operate with them, as we believe Ryanair's new low fare 
domestic flights to Fiumicino can significantly assist Alitalia through the restructuring which is 
necessary to restore its profitability and secure the future of as many of Alitalia's employees as 
possible.  Ryanair believes that by offering to feed Alitalia's international hub at Fiumicino and by 
searching for opportunities to work with and assist Alitalia in its turnaround, that we can help the new 
investors and the management of Alitalia to return that airline to profitability and viability.
 Ryanair's three new domestic routes from Rome Fiumicino to Catania, Lamezia and Palermo go on sale today 
at fares that start from just EUR49 one way and these low fares will enable many thousands of Italian 
families to return home to the South of Italy or Sicily in time for the Christmas celebrations."

EXISTING ROUTES
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (14 Nov) announced it will open 9 new routes from Dublin 
(from April 2014) as well as increased frequencies on 8 existing routes, which will deliver an additional 
700,000 passengers p.a. and support 700* new on-site jobs at Dublin Airport. This new capacity is the 
final part of the 1 million passenger growth that Ryanair promised to deliver at the main Irish airports 
as a direct result of the Government's decision to scrap the EUR3 travel tax from April 2014.
 Ryanair's growth at Dublin from April 2014 will deliver:
 --    9 new routes to Almeria, Bari, Basel, Bucharest, Chania, Comiso, Lisbon, Marrakesh & Prague
 --    85 Dublin routes in total
 --    More flights & improved schedules on the Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow (PIK), London 
(STN), Madrid, Manchester and Nice routes (from 300 to 400 flights p/w)
 --    Over 700,000 new Ryanair passengers p.a. at Dublin (8.25m in total)
 --    1,000,000 new customers which will create over 1,000* jobs at Ireland's airports
 Ryanair also announced that it will create over 300 new direct jobs in Ireland in 2014, for pilots, cabin 
crew, customer service specialists and software developers as the airline rolls out an extensive programme 
of customer service and website improvements. These 300 new Ryanair jobs will be in addition to the 1,000 
indirect jobs that will be created at Dublin, Knock and Shannon airports to cater for the 1 million 
passenger growth which Ryanair will deliver from April 2014 following the scrapping of the travel tax.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to deliver 9 new Europe routes to/from Dublin and over 1m new passengers for Ireland 
(which will create over 1,000 new jobs at the Irish airports) in direct response to the Government's 
welcome initiative to scrap the EUR3 air travel tax from April 2014. A critical component of this growth 
will be 100 extra weekly flights into Dublin from Britain, which will reverse the recent tourism declines 
in UK visitors coming to Ireland. Ryanair's fares on these new Europe routes start from EUR29.99, which is 
half the price of Aer Lingus' lowest fares (EUR60) to Lisbon, Madrid, Nice and Prague.
 We are also proud to confirm that we will create over 300 new direct jobs in Ryanair in Ireland in 2014 
to crew our new based aircraft and to help us roll out our very exciting growth plans, which will include 
significant improvements to the Ryanair.com website and to our industry leading customer service."
 daa's Kevin Toland said:
 "Daa is pleased by Ryanair's decision to accelerate its growth at Dublin Airport in response to the 
Government's decision on the air travel tax and the attractive suite of incentives we offer to airlines 
launching new services or increasing passenger numbers. This year represents the third successive year of 
growth at Dublin Airport on both short and long haul services, which is very positive for tourism and the 
overall economy, and today's announcement provides a strong platform for continuation of this trend."

operate on Irish registered aircraft (defined as Irish territory) and pay their taxes in Ireland, in 
accordance with the EU Regulations governing mobile transport workers and the Belgium-Ireland double 
taxation treaty.
 The Charleroi Labour Court's decision is in line with a previous decision in 2007 when the Mons Appeal 
Court upheld Ryanair's position that any dispute regarding contracts of employment should be dealt with 
through the Irish Courts and mirrors other rulings in Germany, Italy and Spain.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "Ryanair welcomes this ruling which upholds the EU regulations governing mobile transport workers and 
which mirrors similar rulings in Germany, Italy and Spain. Since Ryanair crew members spend their working 
day on Irish aircraft (which is Irish territory), are employed on Irish contracts and pay their taxes and 
social taxes in Ireland, there is no basis for any claim that they should be subject to Belgian employment 
law "

 RYANAIR REPORTS H1 PROFITS UP 1% TO EUR602M,
 TRAFFIC AND LOAD FACTORS RISE ON LOWER FARES
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline today (Nov 4) reported that H1 profits rose by 1% to EUR602m, as its 
traffic grew 2% to 49m passengers.  Revenue per passenger increased 2% due to a 22% rise in ancillary revenues.  
Unit costs rose 3% largely due to a 7% increase in fuel prices.  Average fares fell by 2% during the half year, and 
have continued to fall this winter, which will lead to a reduction in Ryanair's full year profit guidance from EUR570m 
to approx. EUR510m.

"Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 We are pleased to report slightly increased H1 profits, particularly against a backdrop of softer fares 
this summer.  Yields in Q3 have softened, which is good news for our customers and has led to strong 
growth in traffic (up 6% in Oct) and load factors (up 1%).  The highlights of the half year include:-
 --    Record H1 profit of EUR602m, in line with previous guidance.
 --    Traffic up 2% to 49m (load factor up 1% to 85%).
 --    Seven new bases and 116 new routes opened
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
 --    175 new aircraft order agreed with Boeing.
 --    New 10 year growth deals at London (STN) and Warsaw (MOD) airports.
 --    Irish travel tax EUR3 scrapped from April 2014.
 --    EUR177m share buyback completed, H1 cash of EUR3.5bn.
 The 2% fall in fares during H1 was impacted by one off events such as the timing of Easter (not in Q1), 
the summer heatwave in northern Europe, French ATC strikes in June, and weaker sterling.  Ryanair has 
responded to these market conditions by stimulating traffic growth with aggressive fare promotions.  This 
will lay the foundation for traffic growth over the coming years, particularly as our new 175 aircraft 
deliver from September 2014.  While fares are falling, ancillary revenues grew strongly by 22% to EUR713m, 
driven by the successful roll out of reserved seating, priority boarding and higher credit/debit card 
fees.
 Unit costs in H1 rose 3% mainly due to a 7% increase in fuel costs.  Excluding fuel, sector length 
adjusted unit costs fell by 2% as we continued to deliver cost efficiencies, despite higher Eurocontrol 
charges and the impact of a 2% pay increase from April last.
 1.  Growth - New Routes and Bases
 Our new routes and bases performed well this summer, albeit at weaker yields.  With only 9 (net) 
additional aircraft, we still managed to grow our H1 traffic by 2%, thanks to a load factor increase of 
1%.  High cost competitor airlines are continuing to cut capacity in major markets such as France, 
Germany, Poland, Spain and Italy and this continues to create growth opportunities for Ryanair.  With our 
175 new aircraft order, our new 10 year growth deals at London (STN) and Warsaw (MOD) airports, and the 
Irish Govt's recent decision to scrap the EUR3 travel tax from April 2014, Ryanair is well positioned to 
return to strong and profitable traffic growth from September 2014 onwards.
 2.  Digital Marketing and Customer Service
 After 20 consecutive years of rapid growth, the next 12 months will see a brief pause in traffic growth, 
along with stable load factors.  We intend to use this period to further improve our industry leading 
customer service.  Over recent weeks we have announced a series of customer service initiatives including 
scrapping the Recaptcha security feature, allowing a small second carry-on bag, "quiet flights" before 8am 
and after 9pm, a 24 hour "grace period" to allow passengers correct minor booking errors, and 
significantly reduced boarding card reissue and standard bag fees.  These customer service initiatives 
have been widely welcomed and generated very positive feedback from our growing customer base.
 We have also announced a programme of significant upgrades to our website and digital platforms including 
a simpler website homepage, an improved booking path reducing (from 17 to 5) the clicks required to make a 
booking, and a new "My Ryanair" member service which allows customers to register their name, address and 
credit card details just once.   Early next year we will roll out mobile boarding passes, a "Share the 
Fare" option, a "Fare Finder" feature which will enable our customers to find dates and flights where 
these lowest fares are available, a new mobile app for smartphones and tablets, and in June 2014 new 
bespoke language websites in all Ryanair's major EU markets starting with Spain and Italy.
 3.  Allocated Seating
 Ryanair is pleased to announce in today's results that it will from 1 Feb 2014 move to fully allocated 
seating on all Ryanair flights, making the boarding process smoother, and enabling families or other 
groups to ensure that they sit together.  Passengers will still be able to choose our popular reserved 
seating service (select front row or over-wing seats), or alternatively select seats elsewhere on the 
aircraft, as long as they check-in more than 24 hours prior to the date of departure.  All passengers who 
don't wish to pay a small fee (EUR5) to select their preferred seats will be allocated seats during the 24 
hours prior to the date of scheduled departure.  This return to allocated seating is Ryanair's response to 
the enormous demand from our customers in recent weeks via Ryanair's "Tell MOL" customer feedback 
initiative.  Ryanair's decision to launch fully allocated seating is also part of the airline's commitment 
to listen to its customers, and improve its industry leading customer service which comprises Europe's 
lowest air fares, most on-time flights,  fewest lost bags, and fewest customer complaints.
 4.  Fuel
 Ryanair remains 90% hedged for FY'14 at $980 per tonne (approx. $98 p.bl).  We have taken advantage of 
recent weakness in oil prices and the US dollar to extend our FY15 hedges to 60% at approx. $94 p.bl. 
which at current market rates should deliver a unit cost fuel reduction of approx. 4% in FY15.
 5.  Balance Sheet
 Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry.  Our fleet has been purchased at 
substantial discounts, which is a significant long term benefit for shareholders.  Despite EUR177m of 
share buybacks during H1 (and a further EUR75m in Oct), gross cash at the end of Sept was over EUR3.5bn.  
We plan to execute at least EUR150m of further share buybacks before the end of FY14.  In addition the 
airline's commitment to return up to EUR600m to shareholders via share buybacks and special dividend 
before the end of FY15 remains unchanged.  This will bring to over EUR2.4bn the amount of funds returned 
to shareholders since FY08.
 6.  Trading Update and Guidance Outlook
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
 On September 4, Ryanair announced that it had noticed a perceptible dip in forward fares and yields into 
Q3 due to, (i) increased price competition, (ii) softer economic conditions in Europe and, (iii) the 
weaker Euro/Sterling exchange rate.  We responded to this yield softness by lowering our FY14 traffic 
target from over 81.5m to just under 81m.  We also released a range of lower fares and aggressive seat 
sales to stimulate traffic, load factors and bookings across all markets.  The success of this strategy 
has been vindicated by our 6% rise in October traffic, and a 1% increase in load factors.
 Market pricing remains weak, so we will continue to promote low fare seat sales throughout the remainder 
of both Q3 and Q4.  Forward bookings are running slightly ahead of last year, but the softness in fares 
and yields continues.  Based on reasonable visibility we expect Q3 fares to fall by 9%, and Q4 (albeit 
with zero visibility) to fall by up to 10% (without the benefit of Easter which will be in Q1 FY15).  Our 
cost discipline will see sector length adjusted cost per passenger fall by 7% in H2.  However the 
continuing fare and yield softness means that full year profits will be lower than previously guided 
(EUR570m to EUR600m).  We now expect the full year outturn to be between EUR500m to EUR520m due entirely 
to this lower fare environment.

 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR370.4m in the period to EUR3,643.0m primarily due the net profit 
after tax of EUR601.9m, offset by a EUR176.6m share buy-back and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment 
for derivatives.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended September 30, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 5% to EUR523.8m primarily due a 5% increase in total operating revenues 
driven by increased traffic and stronger ancillary revenues, partially offset by a 5% increase in total 
operating expenses.  Total operating revenues increased by 5% to EUR1,912.6m primarily due to a 20% rise 
in ancillary revenues and a 2% increase in passenger numbers. Average fares remained flat compared to the 
quarter ended September 30, 2013 due to the weakening of sterling to the euro and the impact of the heat 
wave in Northern Europe on yields on close-in bookings. Fuel, which represents 48% of total operating 
costs in the quarter, compared to 47% in the comparative period, increased by 8% to EUR624.7m due to a 
higher euro price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel 
remained flat, however, including fuel unit costs rose by 3%.  Operating margin, as a result of the above, 
remained flat whilst operating profit increased by 6% to EUR613.9m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 5% to EUR1,912.6m primarily due to strong ancillary revenues and a 
2% increase in passenger numbers to 26.0m.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 3%, primarily due to the strong growth in ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 2% to EUR1,556.4m primarily due to the 2% increase in passenger 
numbers, offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro and the impact of the summer heat wave in 
Northern Europe. Load factor remained flat at 87%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 20% to EUR356.2m, faster than the 2% increase in passenger numbers, due 
to a combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network and 
higher admin and credit card fees.
 Total operating expenses increased by 5% to EUR1,298.7m due to the 8% rise in fuel costs and increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline, partially offset by the weakening of the sterling to the 
euro.
 Staff costs increased by 3% to EUR128.2m due to the increased level of activity and the impact of a 2% 
pay increase granted in April 2013, offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 8% to EUR91.8m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and the higher average number of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this year (September 30, 2013: 
246) compared to the prior year  (September 30, 2012: 240) and spare engines purchased in the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -6-
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 8% to EUR624.7m due to higher euro fuel prices and the increased activity 
in the quarter.
 Maintenance costs decreased by 20% to EUR24.1m, primarily due to improved terms on certain aircraft 
leases, offset by costs arising from the increased level of activity.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 12% to EUR26.2m, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor 
financing costs and the higher average number of leased aircraft in the quarter (September 30, 2013: 57) 
compared to the prior year (September 30, 2012: 55).
 Route charges rose by 11% to EUR163.3m due to the increased number of sectors flown and higher unit 
charges.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 2% to EUR190.7m, due to the increase in sectors flown and the mix 
of new routes and bases launched, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, decreased by 22% to EUR49.7m, 
primarily due to a reduction in marketing spend per passenger, lower ancillary revenue costs and credit 
card processing fees.
 Operating margin remained flat at 32% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 6% to EUR613.9m.
 Finance income decreased by 77% to EUR2.7m due to the timing of the receipt of the Aer Lingus dividend 
income (it was paid in quarter 1 this financial year and quarter 2 last year) and lower interest rates on 
deposits.
 Finance expense decreased by 21% to EUR21.0m primarily due to lower interest rates and gross debt this 
quarter compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2012.

 Independent review report of KPMG to Ryanair Holdings plc
 Introduction
 We have been engaged by Ryanair Holdings plc ("the Company") to review the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2013, which comprise the condensed 
consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the condensed 
consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed consolidated interim statement of 
cash flows, the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in shareholders' equity and the 
related notes.  We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and 
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information 
in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
 This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the 
Company in meeting the requirements of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the 
Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK's 
Financial Conduct Authority ("the UK FCA").  Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose.  To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The half-yearly financial report, including the condensed consolidated interim financial statements 
contained therein, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.  The directors are 
responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) 
Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the UK FCA.
 As disclosed in note 1 - basis of preparation, the annual consolidated financial statements of the 
Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union ('EU').  The directors 
are responsible for ensuring that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this 
half-yearly financial report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, "Interim Financial Reporting," 
as adopted by the EU.
 Our responsibility
 Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements in the half-yearly financial report, based on our review.
 Scope of review
 We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 
2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board.  A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
 Conclusion
 Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 
September 30, 2013 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the 
EU, the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Central 
Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK FCA.

 Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length 
transaction between informed and willing parties, other than as part of a forced liquidation sale. The 
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the 
Company's financial instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --    Available for sale: The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is their quoted market 
bid price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --    Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --    Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at September 30, 2013 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --    Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted 
at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 2013 to 
arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the six months to 
September 30, 2013 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the six months to September 30, 2013, 
there were no reclassifications of financial assets and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial statement of financial position, are as follows:

13.     Share buy-back
 In June 2013 the Company bought back 24.1m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6m.  This is 
equivalent to approximately 1.7% of the Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased 
have been cancelled. Accordingly, share capital decreased by 24.1m ordinary shares with a nominal value of 
EUR0.2m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.2m.  The capital redemption 
reserve is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.

Body
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of 
these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations.
 --      IAS 32 (amendment) "Financial instruments: Presentation-offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 36 (amendment) "Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 39 (amendment) "Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRIC 21 "Levies" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" (2009, as amended in 2011) (effective date to be determined).
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.       Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the six months ended September 
30, 2013 was 12.2% (September 30, 2012: 12.3%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2013 
of EUR83.5m (September 30, 2012: EUR83.7m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary 
differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.       Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.0m is the fair value of various share options 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -7-
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.       Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.       Capital commitments
 At September 30, 2013 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 301 (2012: 298) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  
Following shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, the Group has agreed to purchase 175 new Boeing 
737 800NG aircraft between fiscal 2015 and 2019.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR221.2m at March 31, 2013 to EUR242.0m at 
September 30, 2013 is comprised of a gain of EUR20.8m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013 to EUR1.52 
per share at September 30, 2013.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Financial risk factors
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 The half-year financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2013 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies since year-end.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --  Level 2: Inputs other that quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --  Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Summary half-year ended September 30, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 1% to EUR601.9m compared to EUR595.6m in the half-year ended September 30, 
2012 primarily due to strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic, offset by a 6% increase in total operating 
expenses and lower average fares.  Total operating revenues increased by 5% to EUR3,254.8m, primarily due to 
the strong ancillary revenues which grew by 22%, significantly faster than the 2% increase in passenger numbers, 
to EUR712.7m, offset by a 2% reduction in average fare due to the summer heat wave in Northern Europe, the 
weakening of sterling to the euro, the timing of Easter and the French ATC strike in June 2013. Total revenue per 
passenger, as a result, increased by 2% whilst Load Factor increased by 1 point to 85% compared to the period 
ended September 30, 2012.
 Total operating expenses increased by 6% to EUR2,537.6m, due to an increase in fuel prices and the higher level 
of activity. Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs in both the current and comparative period, 
increased by 7% to EUR1,201.3m due to the higher euro price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period.  
Unit costs increased by 3%.  Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 22% whilst operating profit increased by 1% 
to EUR717.2m.
 Net margin was down 1 point to 18%, compared to September 30, 2012.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 42.04 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 41.34 euro 
cent at September 30, 2012.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash decreased by EUR98.1m since March 31, 2013 to EUR3,460.9m and Gross debt fell by EUR211.9m to 
EUR3,286.4m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR561.8m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR291.7m, a EUR176.6m share buy-back programme and debt repayments.  As a result the 
Group had a stronger Net cash position of EUR174.5m at period end (March 31, 2013: EUR60.7m).
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the half-year ended September 30, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 1% to EUR601.9m primarily due to strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic,  
offset by a 6% increase in total operating expenses and a 2% reduction in average fares.  Total operating revenues 
increased by 5% to EUR3,254.8m primarily due to a 22% increase in ancillary revenues, a 2% rise in passenger 
numbers offset by a 2% reduction in average fares.  Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs in both the 
current and comparative period, increased by 7% to EUR1,201.3m due to a higher euro price per gallon paid and 
increased activity in the period.  Unit costs rose by 3%.  Operating margin, as a result of the above, decreased by 1 
point to 22% whilst operating profit increased by 1% to EUR717.2m.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 Total operating revenues increased by 5% to EUR3,254.8m primarily due to strong ancillary revenues and a 2% 
increase in passenger numbers to 49.2m, offset by a 2% drop in average fares, partially due to the timing of Easter, 
the weakening of sterling to the euro, the summer heat wave in Northern Europe and the adverse impact of the 
French ATC strike in June 2013.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 2%, primarily due to the strong growth in ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 1% to EUR2,542.1m due to a 2% increase in passenger numbers, 
offset by the 2% fall in average fares, due to the timing of Easter, the weakening of sterling to the euro, the summer 
heat wave in Northern Europe and the adverse impact of the French ATC strike in June 2013. Load factor rose by 1 
point to 85%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 22% to EUR712.7m, faster than the 2% increase in passenger numbers, due to a 
combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network and higher admin and 
credit card fees.
 Total operating expenses increased by 6% to EUR2,537.6m due to the 7% rise in fuel costs and increased costs 
associated with the growth of the airline, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR258.6m primarily due to a 7% increase in hours and a 2% pay increase granted 
in April 2013, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR182.3m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity, the higher average number of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this year (September 30, 2013: 246) compared to 
the prior year  (September 30, 2012: 240) and spare engines purchased in the period.
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 7% to EUR1,201.3m due to higher euro fuel prices and the increased activity in the 
half-year.
 Maintenance costs decreased by 7% to EUR53.9m, primarily due to improved terms on certain aircraft leases, 
offset by costs arising from the increased level of activity.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 11% to EUR52.6m, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor financing costs 
and the higher average number of leased aircraft in the period (September 30, 2013: 57) compared to the prior year 
(September 30, 2012: 55)
 Route charges rose by 12% to EUR318.5m due to the increased number of sectors flown and higher unit charges.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 4% to EUR367.0m, due to the 2% increase in sectors flown, increased 
charges in Spain, a quadrupling of ATC charges in Italy and the mix of new routes and bases launched, partially 
offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, decreased by 10% to EUR103.4m, primarily 
due to a reduction in marketing spend per passenger, lower ancillary revenue costs and credit card processing 
fees.
 Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 22% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 1% to EUR717.2m.
 Finance income decreased by 39% to EUR11.8m due to lower interest rates on deposits, partially offset by 
increased dividend income in the period.
 Finance expense decreased by 19% to EUR42.7m primarily due to lower interest rates and gross debt compared 
to the half-year ended September 30, 2012.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash decreased by EUR98.1m since March 31, 2013 to EUR3,460.9m and Gross debt fell by EUR211.9m to 
EUR3,286.4m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR561.8m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR291.7m, a EUR176.6m share buy-back programme and debt repayments.  As a result the 
Group had a stronger Net cash position of EUR174.5m at period end (March 31, 2013: EUR60.7m).

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 3 NEW KNOCK ROUTES FROM APRIL 2014
 (EINDHOVEN, GLASGOW PRESTWICK, KAUNAS & INCREASED LONDON FREQUENCIES)
 80,000 NEW PASSENGERS P.A. AS IRISH TRAVEL TAX SCRAPPED
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (31 Oct) announced it will open 3 new routes from Knock to 
Eindhoven, Glasgow Prestwick & Kaunas from April 2014, as well as increased frequencies on its London 
route, which will deliver an additional 80,000 passengers p.a. and support 80* new on-site jobs at Knock. 
This growth is part of the 1m extra passengers p.a. that Ryanair will deliver at the main Irish airports 
in a direct response to the Irish Government's decision to scrap the EUR3 travel tax from April 2014.
 Ryanair's expansion at Knock from April 2014 will deliver:
 --    3 new routes to Eindhoven, Glasgow Prestwick & Kaunas (16 routes in total)
 --    Increased frequency on the Knock to London routes (16 to 18 flights pw)
 --    80,000 new Ryanair passengers p.a. (580,000 in total)
 --    80* new on-site jobs
 --    Knock traffic will grow from 670,000 to over 750,000 p.a
 Ryanair's 3 new Knock routes will start in April 2014 and go on sale on the Ryanair.com website tomorrow. 
Following successful negotiations with Knock and Shannon, Ryanair is finalising its discussions with the 
other main Irish airports - Cork, Dublin and Kerry- to finalise its growth plans for summer 2014 and hopes 
to announce more route and frequency growth from Ireland in the coming weeks.
 In Knock, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to announce 3 new routes and increased frequencies on its London route from Knock 
from April 2014, which will deliver 80,000 new passengers p.a. and support up to 80 new on-site jobs at 
Knock. This growth is in direct response to the Government's very welcome decision to scrap the EUR3 air 
travel tax from April 2014.
 The scrapping of the travel tax will help restore Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness to 
overseas visitors from the UK and Continental Europe in particular.  Having met with all five of the main 
Irish airports, and announced new growth for 2014 at Shannon and Knock, we hope to announce further new 
route and traffic growth plans over the coming weeks."

 --    "Share the Fare" option (end Mar), which helps customers find Ryanair low fares and share them on 
your favourite social network.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR UNVEILS IMPROVED WEBSITE & DIGITAL SERVICE
 --    Finally, Ryanair will release tailored language websites in all its major EU markets starting with 
a Spanish language and tailored website and an Italian version by end June 2014, making the Ryanair.com 
website readily available and accessible in all Ryanair's major EU markets during 2014.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We are excited and delighted with the new, cleaner, easier to use Ryanair.com website which 
significantly improves Ryanair's industry leading customer service.  The Recaptcha security code will 
disappear on Friday for individual customers. Ryanair's new improved website will be released in just over 
two weeks and our soon to be delivered features including secure membership, low fares finder, mobile app, 
mobile boarding passes and individually tailored national websites in our bigger EU markets will help more 
customers to make great savings and waste less time by booking Ryanair's flights on the new and seriously 
improved Ryanair.com website.
 We sincerely hope that customers will from 15 Nov next enjoy using our new and improved website.  If they 
feel there are any other customer service improvements we can make, then I hope they will contact me using 
the "Tell MOL" feature on the Ryanair.com website."

 25 October 2013
 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS OVER NEXT 6 MONTHS
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline today (25 Oct) unveiled a programme of enhancements to its 
industry leading customer service which has seen the airline's traffic grow to over 80m p.a. thanks to 
Ryanair's unbeatable combination of lowest fares, on-time flights, new aircraft fleet and the reassuring 
guarantee of no fuel surcharges.
 After an extensive customer feedback programme through its "Tell MOL" page on the Ryanair.com website, 
Ryanair confirmed that it was introducing the following customer service improvements over the next 6 
months to end March 2014.
 1.   The "Recaptcha" security code will be removed from the Ryanair.com website for individual bookings 
next week (on 1 Nov next).
 2.   From 1 Nov, customers who book directly on the Ryanair.com website (i.e. not via travel agents or 
screenscrapers) will be given a 24 hour grace period from the time of their original booking, to correct 
any minor errors (i.e. spelling, names, routings) made in their original booking.
 3.   From 1 Nov, Ryanair will operate "quiet flights", prior to 8am in the mornings and after 9pm in the 
evenings.  During these quiet flight periods no PA's will be made on board other than required safety 
announcements.  Ryanair will also dim the lights during these quiet flights so that any customers who wish 
to snooze, can comfortably do so.
 4.   From 1 Dec, Ryanair will allow passengers to bring a 2(nd) small carry-on bag (small ladies handbag 
or small airport shopping bag) no bigger than 35 x 20 x 20 cms which will allow a bottle of wine or 
equivalent to be carried.
 5.   From 1 Dec, Ryanair's boarding card reissue fee will be cut from EUR70/GBP70 to EUR15/GBP15 for 
customers who have already checked in online.  Customers who fail to check-in online will continue to pay 
a EUR70/GBP70 airport check-in fee.
 6.   From 1 Jan, Ryanair's standard airport bag fees will be cut from EUR60/GBP60 to EUR30/GBP30 at the 
bag drop desk, and from EUR60/GBP60 to EUR50/GBP50 at the boarding gate, bringing them into line with 
competitor airline standard airport bag fees.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR ANNOUNCES CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS
 "We are very excited at these significant improvements in what is already Europe's No.1 customer service 
airline.  As we implement our plans to grow from 80m to over 110m customer p.a. over the next 5 years, we 
are actively listening and responding to our customers so that they can continue to expect low fares and 
on-time flights on Ryanair, but will now enjoy easier website access, 24 hour grace periods, a 2(nd) small 
carry-on bag, reduced airport bag fees and quiet flights. We hope that our passengers will enjoy these 
service improvements, while still enjoying Ryanair's low fares and on-time flights."
 Ryanair's Director of Customer Service, Caroline Green said:
 "These are the first in a series of customer service improvements which Ryanair is actively working on to 
make our low fare services easier to access and even more enjoyable for our millions of customers.  As 
some of these policy changes will require website changes and handling staff retraining, we will be 
rolling them out over the next few months as we strive to further improve Europe's No.1 customer service 
airline. If customers have any other suggestions or feedback they want us to hear, then please use our 
customer feedback service "Tell MOL" on the Ryanair.com website."

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES 8 NEW SHANNON ROUTES IN APRIL 2014
 (BERLIN, FARO, FUERTEVENTURA, KRAKOW, MUNICH, NICE, PARIS & WARSAW)
 300,000 NEW PASSENGERS P.A. & 300 NEW JOBS CREATED,
 AS IRISH TRAVEL TAX SCRAPPED
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (24 Oct) announced it will open 8 new routes from Shannon to 
Berlin, Faro, Fuerteventura, Krakow, Munich, Nice, Paris and Warsaw from April 2014, which will deliver an 
additional 300,000 passengers p.a. and support 300* new on-site jobs at Shannon. This growth is the first 
300,000 of an extra 1m passengers p.a. that Ryanair will deliver at Irish airports in direct response to 
the Government's budget decision to scrap the EUR3 travel tax from April 2014.
 Ryanair's expansion at Shannon from April 2014 will deliver:
 --    8 new routes to Berlin, Faro, Fuerteventura, Krakow, Munich, Nice, Paris & Warsaw
 --    Increased frequency on the Stansted route from 14 to 15 per week
 --    300,000 new Ryanair passengers p.a. (750,000 in total)
 --    300* new on site jobs
 --    Shannon traffic will grow from 450,000 to 750,000 p.a
 Ryanair's 8 new Shannon routes will start in April 2014 and go on sale on the Ryanair.com website 
tomorrow.
 Ryanair is in continuing discussions with the four other main Irish airports - Cork, Dublin, Kerry and 
Knock - to finalise its growth plans for summer 2014 and hopes to announce more route and frequency growth 
from Ireland in the coming weeks.
 In Shannon, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to announce 8 new routes and increased frequency on the Stansted route from Shannon 
in April 2014, which will deliver 300,000 additional passengers p.a. and support 300 new on-site jobs at 
Shannon. This growth is in direct response to the Government's welcome decision to scrap the EUR3 air 
travel tax from April 2014.
 The scrapping of the air travel tax will help restore Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness to 
overseas visitors from the UK and Continental Europe in particular.  Having met with all five of the main 
Irish airports, we hope to announce further new route and traffic growth plans over the coming weeks."
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LAUNCH 8 NEW SHANNON ROUTES IN APRIL 2014
 Shannon Airport CEO, Neil Pakey said:
 "We are delighted that Ryanair have shown real commitment to the Shannon Region in announcing 8 new 
European routes for 2014, in addition to the 10 already served from Shannon. The timing of this 
announcement couldn't be better for inbound visitors in particular, given the focus next year on the Wild 
Atlantic Way and on Limerick as the City of Culture."

Civil Aviation Authority CAA considers deregulation for Stansted
Civil Aviation Authority CAA considers deregulation for Stansted

News Release
 17 October 2013
CAA CONSIDERS DEREGULATION FOR STANSTED AFTER AIRPORT STRIKES DEALS WITH AIRLINES
 The UK Civil Aviation Authority is today launching a consultation on the impact of long-term agreements 
made by Stansted Airport and its principal customers on the airport's market power.
 Under the Civil Aviation Act 2012 a market power test is required as part of the process to decide 
whether an airport should be regulated in the future and, if so, how.
 The consultation sets out the CAA's provisional view that the deals Stansted has agreed with its two 
principal customers change the assessment of the airport's market power, and mean that deregulation could 
be appropriate. However, this provisional view is subject to consultation, and may change depending on 
stakeholders' responses.
 Iain Osborne, CAA Group Director of Regulatory Policy, said: "Our aim is to protect passengers, so we 
will act if the market fails. But regulation must achieve more benefits for consumers than it costs. That 
is why, following the airport's recent deals with easyJet and Ryanair, it is sensible for us to consider 
whether regulation remains the best thing for Stansted's passengers."
 The CAA originally published a consultation on its 'minded to' assessment for Stansted's market power in 
January 2013. The CAA acknowledged in its consultation that the change of ownership of Stansted and its 
impact on the airports relationship with its customers could alter its view when it consulted.
 Following Stansted's subsequent acquisition by Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and MAG's agreements with 
Ryanair and easyJet, today's consultation invites stakeholders to comment on the CAA's assessment of how 
these agreements may affect the market power assessment.
 The consultation focuses solely on the impact of the key developments on the 'Minded to' assessment we 
consulted on in January, and their implications on the licensing of Stansted after April 2014. It does not 
update the CAA's thinking on all matters raised in the assessment, nor does it afford stakeholders the 
opportunity to comment on submissions made by other stakeholders in response to that consultation.
Civil Aviation Authority CAA considers deregulation for Stansted
 After the consultation, the final determination on Stansted's market power will be published early in 
2014. The form of regulation for Stansted will be finalised after that.

 Notes to Editors
 1.   On 28 February 2013 Manchester Airports Group plc acquired Stansted airport from Heathrow Airport 
Holdings Limited (previously BAA).
 2.   In April 2013, the CAA published its initial proposals on the appropriate economic regulatory 
framework for Stansted Airport Limited from April 2014, when the present regulatory arrangements end.
 3.   On 16 September Ryanair and Manchester Airport Group plc announced a long-term agreement to grow 
traffic through Stansted Airport: http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/mag-
and-ryanair-sign-ten-year-growth-agreement-at-london-stansted
 4.   On 13 June 2013, Stansted airport announced a new long-term growth framework deal with easyJet to 
allow the airline to more than double its passenger numbers at Stansted from a current 2.8 million 
passengers 
to 
six 
million 
passengers 
a 
year 
over 
the 
next 
five 
years.

 5.   The CAA has not reached a provisional view on whether the developments change the market power 
assessment for the cargo market but would welcome stakeholders' views on the benefits and the adverse

 RYANAIR WILL GROW TRAFFIC AT IRISH AIRPORTS BY OVER 1M PASSENGERS P.A. FROM APRIL 2014
 1,000 NEW TOURISM JOBS TO BE CREATED FROM APRIL AS RYANAIR RESPONDS TO GOVERNMENT WITHDRAWAL OF TOURIST 
TAX
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (16 Oct) announced plans to grow its traffic at its Irish 
airports by at least 1m passengers p.a. from April 2014 in a direct response to the Govt's announcement in 
yesterday's budget that the EUR3 travel tax (which applies only to air passengers) will be scrapped in 
April 2014.
 Ryanair highlighted that since the travel tax was introduced in January 2009, traffic at the main Irish 
airports had declined from 30.5m passengers in 2008 to 23.5m in 2012.  Ryanair believes that much of this 
traffic can now be recovered thanks to the abolition of the travel tax, which makes Ireland a more 
competitive and attractive destination for inbound visitors, particularly those on short flights from the 
UK and Continental Europe.
 Ryanair will now respond positively to the Govt's initiative and announce plans to grow traffic to/from 
its Irish airports by at least 1m passengers p.a. from April 2014.  Ryanair has invited all the main Irish 
airports - Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Knock and Kerry - to meetings in Dublin on Thursday and Friday of this 
week to finalise these growth plans and how it can be split between the airports.  These 1m new passengers 
(up to 500,000 visitors) will deliver more visitors than The Gathering in 2013 and will lead to the 
creation of at least 1,000 new jobs at these Irish airports where research by the Airport Council 
International (ACI) demonstrates that 1,000 new jobs are created at international airports for every 1m 
additional passengers delivered.
 Ryanair expects that this traffic growth will be focused on a range of new routes and additional 
frequencies on existing routes, although the list of routes and frequencies and the share of traffic 
growth will be finalised in talks with the Irish airports over the coming days.
 In Dublin, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
 "Ryanair warmly welcomes the Government's decision to repeal the EUR3 travel tax.  This travel tax 
(originally EUR10) in 2009 caused Irish air travel and tourism to suffer precipitous losses in recent 
years.  The repeal of the air travel tax helps restore Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness to 
overseas visitors from the UK and Continental Europe in particular.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WILL GROW TRAFFIC AT IRISH AIRPORTS
 In response to yesterday's budget, Ryanair will engage over the next 2 days with all of our Irish airport 
partners to see how and where we can add new routes or additional frequencies on existing routes, and 
deliver at least 1m new passengers p.a. at these Irish airports from April 2014, which will create over 
1,000 new jobs as a direct result of the Government's decision to scrap the visitor tax.
 Subject to final negotiation on new routes and additional frequencies on existing routes with the 
individual airports, we hope to be in a position to announce details of new route and traffic growth plans 
at the Irish airports over the coming weeks."

 Irish Stock Exchange welcomes Budget initiative to exempt ESM companies from stamp duty
 Tuesday, 15(th) October 2013
 The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) welcomes the Government's 2014 Budget announcement that it is to exempt from 
stamp duty the transfer of shares of companies on the Enterprise Securities Market (ESM). Stamp duty is currently 
charged at a rate of 1% on investments made in the shares of Irish companies.
 The ISE has long campaigned for the removal of stamp duty on investing in Irish companies - this initiative enables 
ESM companies to operate on a level playing field with their international peers when competing for international 
investment. It matches similar proposals made in the UK earlier this year and moves the Irish market more in line 
with European norms.
 The exemption of ESM companies from stamp duty, the ISE's market for small to medium sized growth companies, 
supports enterprise, growth and employment in Ireland and will help Irish companies to build scale in their business 
through public markets. It will also have a positive impact on investors including pension funds which invest in the 
shares of Irish companies quoted on the ESM.
 ISE Chief Executive Deirdre Somers said the proposal is an essential step in creating the next generation of 
leading Irish publicly-quoted companies and meets some of the Government's stated objectives in the Action Plan 
for Jobs - to incentivise dynamic companies to choose growth and scale using the IPO route as an alternative to 
trade sale.
 "Ireland needs to ensure that Irish companies are as attractive as their international peers when it comes to 
investment. We welcome that ESM companies will now be exempt from stamp duty as this tax acted as a barrier to 
international investment. This initiative is an important step in the creation of the next generation of leading 
companies in Ireland which choose the IPO route to grow - like Ryanair, Kerry Group and Paddy Power. High-
Irish Stock Exchange ESM companies exemption from stamp duty
quality, scalable businesses can create jobs and deliver much needed growth in the Irish economy", said Ms 
Somers.

 Transaction in Own Shares
 3 October, 2013
 Ryanair Holdings Plc ("the Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a combination of share buybacks and dividends. The Company today announces that on 2 October, 2013 it 
purchased for cancellation a total of 10,000,000 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each in the capital 
of the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 All of these repurchased Ordinary Shares are Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Shares ("ADSs"), 
for which the price paid was $50.12 per ADS. The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased under 
anirrevocable non-discretionary programme executed by Davy. In respect of this programme, which will operate 
until 7.00 a.m. on 6 November, 2013 being two business days following publication of Ryanair's interim results in 
respect of the six months ended 30 September, 2013,  Davy will make its trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's 
Ordinary Shares repurchased under the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair. Any 
such acquisitions will be effected within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general 
authority to repurchase shares and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased on 2 October, 2013, the Company will have 
1,413,492,629 Ordinary Shares in issue. To the extent that further Ordinary Shares are repurchased under the 
programme, these shares will also be cancelled.

News Release
 03 October 2013
REGULATION IN THE PASSENGER INTEREST, SUPPORTING INVESTMENT AND DRIVING COMPETITION
 The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has today published for consultation its final proposals for the 
economic regulation of Heathrow and Gatwick airports to protect passengers after April 2014.
 The proposals are tailored so each airport remains globally competitive and can deliver the customer 
experience that passengers expect of airports in the 21(st) century. They challenge airports to operate 
more efficiently, and to work more closely with airlines to develop competitive offerings for travellers.
 Heathrow
 Heathrow has called for a 4.6% annual real-terms increase in its charges over five years. Its airlines 
have asked for a 9.8% per year cut. We propose a price control that will not allow prices to rise by more 
than inflation (measured by RPI). That compares to our initial proposals for RPI minus 1.3%. A key reason 
for this is due to an increase in the cost of capital driven by higher debt costs, offset to some degree 
by more challenging targets for operating efficiency.
 The proposals will put an end to over a decade of prices rising faster than inflation at Heathrow. This 
has supported significant investment in Heathrow over the last decade and our current proposals will also 
create a supportive environment for further capital expenditure.
 Gatwick
 Gatwick has set out a series of price commitments to its users, with the average price to grow by RPI + 
0.5% per year for seven years. The CAA has today published its detailed analysis that suggests that this 
is a fair price. In addition, we believe that the airport's commitments are in passengers' interests, so 
they are the basis of our final proposals. They will be backed by a licence to ensure that they are 
honoured. The licence will also ensure the CAA can continue to act where appropriate to protect users, for 
instance if there are reductions in service quality that are against the passenger interest.
 Stansted
Civil Aviation Authority Regulation in the passenger interest
 Since taking over ownership of Stansted in April, Manchester Airport Group (MAG), has reached long-term 
commercial agreements with its two principal customers, easyJet and Ryanair. We announced on 17 September 
that we would consult on how these may affect the market power assessment before making a final decision 
on whether Stansted should be regulated and if so, on the appropriate regulatory approach for the airport.
 Our final proposals for all three airports would take effect if the CAA makes a final decision in January 
that they have substantial market power that requires regulation.
 Commenting on the final proposals, Dame Deirdre Hutton, CAA Chair, said: "Our proposals demonstrate how 
we can regulate airports more flexibly where this seems best for passengers, but also setting a tough 
efficiency challenge. We expect the airports to work closely with airlines to provide high-quality 
services to passengers.
 "Tackling the upward drift in Heathrow's prices is essential to safeguard its globally competitive 
position. The challenge for Heathrow is to maintain high levels of customer service while reducing costs. 
We are confident this is possible and that our proposals create a positive climate for further capital 
investment, in the passenger interest.
 "Gatwick has tabled a revised price offer to airlines that we consider fair, and its new commitments 
framework offers a chance for a more commercially driven and tailored approach. To protect the diverse 
interests of passengers, we propose a licence based on the commitments.  We would monitor the success of 
such a new approach and adjust our regulation over time to ensure it remains proportionate."
 The proposals are made using powers set out in the Civil Aviation Act 2012, which allows more flexibility 
than in the past, so the CAA's current regulatory proposals reflect the unique circumstances of each 
airport. The CAA is required to assess the level of market dominance at airports it proposes to regulate, 
explaining clearly why regulation will achieve better outcomes for consumers than the market and then set 
out its proposals. To qualify for regulation, an airport must have, or be likely to get, substantial 
market power, and economic regulation must be likely to improve outcomes for passengers. CAA will publish 
its decision on market power for both Gatwick and Heathrow and, where appropriate, its final decision on 
the necessary form of regulation in January.
 An overview of the CAA's consultations for the airports can be seen here, with links through to the 
separate documents: Preparing for a future with passengers at its heart
 The consultation documents for each airport along with several associated documents can be found here: 
Economic Regulation of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted
 A briefing about airport economic regulation, setting out why regulation is necessary and the CAA's 
approach is available here: http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?categoryid=14&pagetype=90&pageid=14627
 Notes to Editors
 1.   The CAA's consultation on its final proposals for regulation and draft licences for each airport 
will run until 04 November 2013.
 2.   Final decisions on market power, economic regulation and final licences for those  airports found to 
have market power will be published in early 2014.
 3.   The CAA is the UK's specialist aviation regulator. Its activities include: making sure that the 
aviation industry meets the highest technical and operational safety standards; preventing holidaymakers 
from being stranded abroad or losing money because of tour operator insolvency; planning and regulating 
all UK airspace; and regulating airports, air traffic services and airlines and providing advice on 
aviation policy from an economic standpoint.

 RYANAIR TO APPEAL FRENCH COURT RULING & FINES
 Ryanair today (2 Oct) confirmed that it will appeal this afternoon's ruling by the Aix En Provence Court 
which imposed fines and damages totalling EUR8m, the majority of which relate to alleged non-payment of 
social insurance and state pension contributions in France for Ryanair crews flying to/from Marseille from 
2007 to 2010, despite the fact that these people were employed on Irish contracts, operating on Irish 
registered aircraft (defined as Irish territory) and have already paid their taxes, social taxes and state 
pension contributions in Ireland, in full compliance with Irish and EU regulations.
 Ryanair believes there is a clear contradiction between current EU employment regulations under which 
these Irish workers paid their taxes and social taxes in Ireland, and the 2006 French decree, which seeks 
to require airline crews operating in Ireland to pay social taxes and pension contributions in France, 
despite the fact that they have already paid them in Ireland.
 Ryanair believes this contradiction can ultimately only be resolved by the European Courts upholding EU 
regulations on the employment of mobile transport workers, and Ryanair intends to pursue this appeal all 
the way to the European Courts. Should Ryanair be ultimately forced to pay these social taxes and pension 
contributions in France, then the vast majority of these contributions will be reclaimable from the Irish 
Government.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "Ryanair will study today's ruling in detail, and will be lodging an early appeal. Since all of our 
people operating to/from Marseille between 2007 and 2010 have already paid their social taxes and pension 
contributions in Ireland, in full compliance with Irish and EU employment regulations, we do not believe 
that either Ryanair or our people can be forced to double pay these contributions a second time in France.
 In the meantime, Ryanair and its people will continue to comply fully with Irish and EU employment law, 
income taxes and social tax obligations."

 80.4M CARRIED IN YEAR TO SEPT (UP 2%)
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (2 Oct) released its passenger and load 
factor statistics for September 2013:
 --    Traffic increased by 3% to over 8m passengers.
 --    Load factor increased 1% to 85%.
 --    Annual traffic to end September grew 2% to over 80m passengers.

 "Ryanair carried over 8m passengers in September 2013 and our load factor rose by 1% from 84% to 85%, as we 
enjoyed a record 12-months with over 80m passengers choosing one of our ultra-low fares. We also carried over 
9m in August - the first European airline to ever do so.
 It's easy to see why so many passengers choose Ryanair, as we offer Europe's lowest fares with no fuel 
surcharges guaranteed, across over 1,600 routes, connecting 180 destinations in 29 countries, while delivering 
Europe's No 1 customer service, with the most on-time flights, the fewest cancellations and least mishandled bags."

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW AMERICAN EXPRESS ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT
 LOWEST FARES, ON-TIME FLIGHTS & BEST SERVICES - RYANAIR IS THE BUSINESS
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (25 Sep) launched a new acceptance agreement 
with American Express, providing passengers, business travellers and corporate travel departments with 
even more ways to book the lowest fares on the Ryanair.com website.
 More than 20% of Ryanair passengers travel on business and Ryanair has improved its services to meet the 
needs of its business passengers by offering:
 1.   The lowest fares and no fuel surcharges, saving companies millions in travel expenses
 2.   Online check-in, avoiding airport queues and saving time
 3.   Priority boarding, ensuring passengers can board and exit the aircraft first
 4.   Reserved seating on one of 45 seats, at the front, rear and over the wings for greater legroom
 5.   Europe's best punctuality (94% of flights were on-time in August) and fewest cancellations
 6.   A free 10kg cabin bag (and the fewest mishandled bags in Europe)
 7.   Free downloads of the Ryanair app (previously EUR3) from 1 October for bookings on the go
 8.   The removal of the Recaptcha security feature for individual passengers from 30 October
 9.   The roll out of a digital marketing strategy to enhance business travel experience
 10. A range of credit and debit card booking options, now including American Express, used by many 
individuals, business travellers and corporate travel departments to book their flights.
 In London, Ryanair's Howard Millar said:
 "Ryanair offers the lowest airfares with no fuel surcharges guaranteed, and the best customer service, 
with the most on-time flights, the fewest cancellations and the least lost bags, which is why we will 
carry 81m passengers this year - more international passengers than any other airline in the world. 
Noweven more passengers including business travellers, travel agents and corporate travel departments, can 
book the lowest fares on the Ryanair.com website by using an American Express card.
 We estimate that 20% to 25% of our passengers are travelling on business, with online check-in ensuring 
they avoid airport queues, while the option of priority boarding and reserved seating has proven extremely 
popular not only with business passengers, who can board and exit the aircraft first, or choose one of 45 
pre-reserved seats, but also with families and those travelling in groups. Indeed, a recent survey of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW AMERICAN EXPRESS AGREEMENT
Ryanair passengers in Spain, where Ryanair is the largest carrier, highlighted that 22% of our passengers 
were travelling on business.
 It's a similar trend across Europe; for example we currently operate approximately 32 daily flights 
between Dublin and London, the busiest international route in Europe and with more than 20% of business 
passengers on these flights, we expect that percentage to grow as we roll out a range of business-tailored 
services, including the option now of booking Ryanair flights with American Express. When it comes to the 
lowest fares, the most on-time flights and the best range of services, Ryanair is the business."
 American Express' Senior VP & GM, Merchant Services Europe, Werner Decker, said:
 "Many of our Cardmembers are regular travellers - whether for leisure or business - and I am pleased that 
they now have the option to book with their American Express Card on the Ryanair website. With millions of 
American Express Cardmembers worldwide, we are delighted that Ryanair is welcoming our Cards."

 --    10 year low cost deal at Warsaw Modlin concluded.
 --    10 year low cost deal at London Stansted agreed.
 To celebrate these milestones, Ryanair briefed shareholders on its plans to roll out a new website and 
digital marketing strategy which will include:
 --    Launching the @Ryanair Twitter page.
 --    Removing the Recaptcha security feature for individual passengers from 30 Oct next (Recaptcha will 
remain in place for high volume bookers, screenscrapers, travel agents etc.).
 --    Ryanair's mobile app will from Tues 1 Oct be downloadable free of charge (previously EUR3).
 --    Booking flow redesign to go live in December.
 --    Passenger registration/retention service live for summer 2014, substantially reducing the time it 
takes to complete bookings.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Our recent agreements with Boeing, Warsaw Modlin and London Stansted show that Ryanair continues to 
widen our substantial unit cost advantage over all other EU airlines.  We will use these lower costs to 
offer even lower fares to Ryanair passengers across all EU markets in which we operate, and already these 
fares (starting from EUR15 one way) are delivering increased bookings and higher advance loads, albeit at 
lower yields this autumn.
 After a summer during which Ryanair's operations set new record highs, with 94% of flights on-time in 
August, less than 1 bag per 3,000 passengers misplaced and less than 1 cancellation for every 10,000 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR ROLLS OUT DIGITAL MARKETING STRATEGY
flights operated, Ryanair's unbeatable low fares continue to attract new passengers from competitors, 
while our unbeatable customer service keeps them coming back for more.
 Our primary focus this winter will be to significantly invest in, and improve, the Ryanair.com website, 
our mobile platform and our interaction with passengers using social media.  We are pleased to remove 
Recaptcha from November for individual passengers, although the security feature will remain in place for 
high volume or multiple IP addresses in order to deter larger travel agents, screenscrapers and others who 
flood our website seeking fare quotes, and diminish our website's accessibility for individual passengers.
 This winter will also see a rolling programme of development to improve the Ryanair.com website, make it 
easier for passengers to navigate, quicker for them to locate our all-inclusive price quotes, identify 
availability of our lower fare promotions and book Ryanair's great fares for themselves and their 
families.  These improvements will be accompanied by a new digital marketing strategy which will see 
Ryanair switch a significant proportion of its marketing budget from old to new media, with a particular 
focus on mobile and social media platforms."
 Ends.

 CAA to consult on market power assessment for Stansted Airport following long-term deals between airlines 
and new owners
 Following yesterday's announcement that Ryanair and Manchester Airport Group plc (MAG) have made a long-
term agreement to grow passenger traffic through Stansted Airport, the CAA has decided it will defer 
making final proposals on future regulation for Stansted from 1 April 2014.  These were due to be 
published on 3 October.
 Under the Civil Aviation Act 2012 a market power test is required as part of the process to decide 
whether an airport should be regulated in the future and if so, how. The CAA originally published a 
consultation on its 'minded to' assessment for Stansted's market power in January 2013, which closed at 
the end of May. The CAA acknowledged that one uncertainty that could alter its view would be if the change 
of ownership of Stansted established different behaviours and relationships with the airlines.
 Following the Ryanair deal and another agreement between MAG and easyJet announced earlier this year, the 
CAA will issue a consultation to invite stakeholders to submit representations on how these agreements may 
affect the market power assessment.
 This announcement does not affect the publication of the CAA's final proposals for future regulation at 
Gatwick and Heathrow, which will still be published on 3 October 2013.

 Notes to Editors
 1.   The CAA is the UK's specialist aviation regulator. Its activities include: making sure that the 
aviation industry meets the highest technical and operational safety standards; preventing holidaymakers 
from being stranded abroad or losing money because of tour operator insolvency; planning and regulating 
all UK airspace; and regulating airports, air traffic services and airlines and providing advice on 
aviation policy.
 2.   To inform the way in which the CAA will approach the regulation of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted 
from April 2014, the CAA is undertaking market power assessments of these three airports.  The work 
Civil Aviation Authority CAA to consult on Stansted market power assessment
started in May 2011.  The CAA consulted on its 'Minded To' determinations for Stansted airport in January 
2013 and is currently considering responses to that consultation.
 3.   On 16 September Ryanair and Manchester Airport Group plc announced a long-term agreement to grow 
traffic through Stansted Airport: http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/mag-
and-ryanair-sign-ten-year-growth-agreement-at-london-stansted
 4.   On 13 June 2013, Stansted airport announced a new long-term growth framework deal with easyJet to 
allow the airline to more than double its passenger numbers at Stansted from a current 2.8 million 
passengers 
to 
six 
million 
passengers 
a 
year 
over 
the 
next 
five 
years.

traffic-at-stansted
 5.   The Ryanair deal, together with an earlier one between Stansted Airport Ltd. (STAL) and easyJet, 
means that over 90 per cent of STAL's business would be covered by long-term agreements that set airport 
charges. While the announcements on the long term agreements have been made, we have not been advised that 
contracts have been finalised.
 6.   On 28 February 2013 Manchester Airports Group plc acquired Stansted airport from Heathrow Airport 
Holdings Limited (previously BAA).
 7.   In April 2013, the CAA published its initial proposals on the appropriate economic regulatory 
framework for Stansted Airport Limited from April 2014, when the present regulatory arrangements end.

 ryanair agrees 10 YEAR GROWTH DEAL at STANSTED
 TRAFFIC TO GROW BY 50% from 13.2M p.a. TO OVER 20M
 SUMMER 2014 SCHEDULE released with 4 NEW ROUTES
 (BORDEAUX, DORTMUND, LISBON & RABAT)
 Ryanair and Manchester Airport Group (MAG), today (16 Sep) announced that they had concluded a  10 year 
growth agreement at London Stansted Airport, which will see Ryanair grow its traffic at Stansted by over 
50%, from 13.2m passengers in 2012 to over 20m p.a. in return for a package of lower costs and more 
efficient facilities at Stansted. This agreement will account for up to 25% of Ryanair's 5 year growth 
plans to 2019. Ryanair expects its Stansted traffic in year 1 of this 10-year deal to grow from 13.2m to 
over 14.5m.
 Ryanair has today released its Stansted summer 2014 schedule (at www.ryanair.com), with a total of 120 
routes, including 4 new routes to Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon and Rabat, which will feature:
 --    43 based aircraft in Stansted (up from 37)
 --    120 routes (up from 116)
 --    4 new routes to Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon & Rabat
 --    Over 2,000 weekly flights (up from 1,800)
 --    Traffic growth from 13.2m to over 20m p.a.
 --    Up to 7,000* new jobs created at Stansted over a 5 year period
 Ryanair celebrated the launch of its Stansted summer 2014 schedule (and 4 new routes) by releasing 
100,000 seats at prices from GBP14.99 for travel in October and November, which are available for booking 
until midnight (24:00hrs) Thur (19 Sep).
 In London, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to have agreed a new 10 year growth deal at London Stansted with MAG. This deal will 
see our Stansted traffic grow by over 50%, from 13.2m in 2012 to over 20m p.a. in return for lower costs 
and more efficient facilities at Stansted. This agreement, which will create over 7000 new jobs in 
Stansted, proves how UK airports can flourish when released from the dead hand of the BAA monopoly and is 
the first dramatic initiative by MAG to reverse 7 years of decline, during which Stansted's traffic fell 
from 23.8m to 17.5m.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR AGREES 10 YEAR GROWTH DEAL AT STANSTED
 As Stansted's biggest airline, Ryanair looks forward to a decade of growing traffic, routes and jobs at 
Stansted. We are also pleased to release our Stansted summer 2014 schedule with 120 routes, including 4 
new routes to Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon and Rabat, which have gone on sale today on the            
www.ryanair.com website."
 MAG's Chief Commercial Officer, Ken O'Toole said:
 "The new long term agreement between Ryanair and MAG at Stansted shows that competition really does work, 
and it represents great news for both passengers and UK businesses.  The deal secures a new and exciting 
era for both Ryanair and Stansted, and we're delighted to be supporting the airline's growth over the next 
ten years.
 Today's announcement, coupled with our GBP80m investment in the terminal, confirms that Ryanair shares 
our confidence, and shows how we are succeeding in transforming Stansted under new ownership. Stansted has 
a really bright future in providing international connectivity for the UK."
 * ACI research confirms up to 1,000 'on-site' jobs are sustained at international airports for every 1m 
passengers

 "Ryanair carried over 9m passengers in August 2013, the first European airline to do so and our load factor also 
rose by 1% from 88% to 89%. Ryanair now carries 9m passengers in just one month whereas tiny Aer Lingus 
needs a whole year to carry 9m.
 To celebrate this new 9m record, Ryanair is releasing 900,000 seats across our entire European at prices from 
EUR14.99, for travel in October and November. These sale fares are available for booking until midnight Monday (9

 RYANAIR TRADING UPDATE - 4 SEPT 2013
 Ryanair Holdings Plc today (4 Sept) issued a trading update and cautioned that while it remains 
comfortable with its H1 guidance, a recent weakness in forward yields into Q3 suggests that there will be 
no upgrade to full year guidance, as the airline now expects the full year outturn will be at the lower 
end of its full year net profit range of EUR570m to EUR600m.  However if fares and yields continue to 
weaken over the coming winter there can be no guarantee that the full year outturn may not finish at or 
slightly below the lower end of this range.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "As indicated during our Q1 results presentation on July 29, close in late bookings in July had been at 
weaker than expected yields due primarily to the heatwave in Northern Europe and weaker sterling/euro 
exchange rates. The close in booking pattern returned to some normality in August, which will ensure that 
our H1 guidance remains unchanged, which is for a small increase in H1 profits over the prior year H1 
comparable.
 However in recent weeks we have noticed a perceptible dip in forward fares and yields into September, 
October and November, which is we believe due to a combination of factors:
 --    Increased price competition and some capacity increases in the UK, Scandinavia, Spanish and Irish 
markets.
 --    The continuing effect of austerity and weak economic conditions across Europe.
 --    Weaker sterling/euro exchange rates.
 We will respond to this lower yield outlook by selectively reducing our winter season capacity, thereby 
cutting our full year traffic target from over 81.5m to just under 81m.  We are also rolling out a range 
of lower fares and aggressive seat sales particularly in those markets mainly UK, Scandinavia, Spain and 
Ireland.
 Ryanair remains confident that we will continue to hit our revised passenger targets albeit at lower 
fares and yields than originally expected.  Accordingly it is prudent to advise shareholders that our full 
year profit after tax (PAT) guidance will now be at the lower end of our EUR570m to EUR600m range.
 However even at or slightly below this full year number of EUR570m PAT, Ryanair cash flows and balance 
sheet remain in rude good health and there is no change to our recently announced plans to complete share 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Trading Statement
buybacks of at least EUR400m (EUR177m already completed in FY March 2014) and up to EUR600m via a 
combination of dividends and/or buybacks in FY March 2015."

 CC requires Ryanair to sell shareholding in Aer Lingus down to 5 per cent
 Ryanair Holdings plc (Ryanair) will be required to sell its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus Group plc 
(Aer Lingus) down to 5 per cent. This will be accompanied by obligations on Ryanair not to seek or accept 
board representation or acquire further shares.
 In its final report published today, the CC confirmed its provisional findings that Ryanair's minority 
shareholding had led or may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition between the 
airlines on routes between Great Britain and Ireland.
 The importance of scale to airlines is clear from evidence of widespread industry consolidation in recent 
years. Against that background, the CC formed the view that Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy 
was likely to be affected by Ryanair's minority shareholding, in particular because it was likely to 
impede or prevent Aer Lingus from being acquired by, or combining with another airline.
 The CC was also concerned that Ryanair's minority shareholding was likely to affect Aer Lingus's 
commercial policy and strategy by allowing Ryanair to block special resolutions, restricting Aer Lingus's 
ability to issue shares and raise capital and to limit Aer Lingus's ability to manage effectively its 
portfolio of Heathrow slots. Ryanair's shareholding also increased the likelihood of Ryanair mounting 
further bids for Aer Lingus, with the associated disruption to Aer Lingus's ability to implement its 
commercial strategy.
 Simon Polito, CC Deputy Chairman and Chairman of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus Inquiry Group, said:
 'In light of the comments received in response to our provisional findings and in line with our usual 
practice, we have reviewed further all the evidence that we received. After careful consideration we 
confirmed our provisional view that Ryanair's minority shareholding has resulted, or may be expected to 
result, in a substantial lessening of competition between the airlines.
 'In line with the recent decision of the European Commission prohibiting Ryanair from acquiring Aer 
Lingus, we recognize that Ryanair and Aer Lingus compete intensely for passengers travelling between Great 
Britain and Ireland, to the benefit of millions of passengers crossing the Irish Sea each year; and that 
Competition Commission Ryanair / Aer Lingus final report
competition between them is at least as intense now as it was when Ryanair first acquired its stake in Aer 
Lingus in 2006.
 'However, we consider that there is a tension between Ryanair's position as a competitor and its position 
as Aer Lingus's largest shareholder, and that Ryanair has an incentive to weaken its rival's effectiveness 
as a competitor. Ryanair's minority shareholding affects Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy in 
various ways that could be crucial to Aer Lingus's future as a competitive airline. We were particularly 
concerned about Ryanair's ability, either directly or indirectly, to impede Aer Lingus from combining with 
another airline to build scale and achieve synergies to remain competitive.
 'Ryanair proposed various remedies to us in an attempt to address our specific concerns. In a dynamic and 
uncertain sector such as the airline industry, however, it is inherently difficult to design remedies that 
would cater for all eventualities. We concluded that the effective and proportionate remedy that would 
address our concerns was to require a partial divestment of Ryanair's shareholding to 5 per cent, 
facilitated by the appointment of a Divestiture Trustee. Aer Lingus would then be free to take actions to 
maintain and strengthen its competitive position in the future for thebenefit ofpassengers on routes 
between Great Britain and Ireland.'
 The final report and all other information relating to the investigation are available on the inquiry 
home page.
 Notes for editors
 1.    The CC is an independent public body, which carries out investigations into mergers, markets and 
the regulated industries.
 2.    The members of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus Inquiry Group are: Simon Polito (CC Deputy Chairman and 
Chairman of the Group), Roger Davis, Carolan Dobson and Professor Michael Waterson.
 3.    Ryanair initially acquired a stake in Aer Lingus in late 2006. In October 2006 Ryanair launched a 
public bid for the remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus. The European Commission investigated the public 
bid and decided to prohibit it in June 2007. In July 2010, the General Court upheld the decision and ruled 
that the European Commission did not have the ability to examine or require divestment of minority 
shareholdings that do not confer 'decisive influence' for the purposes of the EU Merger Regulation. 
Ryanair's latest bid (in July 2012) for the remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus was prohibited by the 
European Commission on 27 February 2013. Ryanair lodged an appeal with the General Court against this 
decision on 8 May 2013.
 4.    The Enterprise Act 2002 empowers the OFT to refer to the CC completed or proposed mergers for 
investigation and report which create or enhance a 25 per cent share of supply in the UK (or a substantial 
part thereof) or where the UK turnover associated with the enterprise being acquired is over GBP70 
million.
 5.    The OFT referred the inquiry to the CC on 15 June 2012. The CC's inquiry was extended whilst 
Ryanair sought to challenge the CC's jurisdiction in view of the European Commission's investigation of 
its latest bid. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (in August 2012) and the Court of Appeal (in December 
2012) both dismissed Ryanair's challenges and the Supreme Court refused it permission to appeal further in 
April 2013. The CC restarted its investigation in March 2013.
 6.    Further information on this inquiry, including the terms of reference and other key documents, as 
well as on the CC and its procedures, can be obtained from the CC website at: www.competition-

 RYANAIR WILL APPEAL UKCC REPORT
 ON 7 YEAR OLD AER LINGUS MINORITY STAKE
 UKCC IGNORES 7 YEARS OF EVIDENCE AND INVENTS "CONCERNS" IN DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY PREDETERMINED 
RULING
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (28 Aug) confirmed that it will appeal the UK 
Competition Commission (UKCC) final report which wrongly found that Ryanair, through its 7 year old 
minority (29.8%) shareholding in Aer Lingus, "had led or may be expected to lead to a substantial 
lessening of competition between the airlines on routes between Great Britain and Ireland". This baseless 
claim is manifestly disproven by 7 years of evidence and by the European Commission's recent (Feb 2013) 
ruling that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has "intensified" since 2007.
 Under EU law, the UKCC has a duty of sincere cooperation with the EU, and cannot contradict or reach 
different conclusions to the European Commission's findings. Inexplicably, today's report by the UKCC 
infringes this legal duty by ignoring and contradicting the recent findings of the European Commission 
that:
 "Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete on a greater number of routes compared to the 2007 Decision", "there is 
significant competitive interaction between the Parties", and"evidence collected by the Commission in the 
market investigation has also confirmed that the competitive relationship between Ryanair and Aer Lingus 
has at least persisted, if not increased, since 2007".
 In addition, the UKCC has inexplicably dismissed Ryanair's unprecedented remedies package which 
comprehensively addressed the UKCC's three invented "concerns". For example, the UKCC rejected Ryanair's 
offer to unconditionally sell its minority stake to any other airline that makes a bid for Aer Lingus and 
obtains acceptances from 50.1% of Aer Lingus' shareholders. Ryanair also offered to support Aer Lingus' 
rights issues and any disposal of Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots, but these simple and effective remedies were 
also rejected by the UKCC.
 The UKCC's manifestly unjust ruling demonstrates that it did not conduct any fair investigation and that 
it has now merely announced what was its pre-determined conclusion.  Ryanair will appeal the UKCC's 
unlawful ruling to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal.  In any event, until the completion of Ryanair's 
appeal to the EU courts against the European Commission's February 2013 prohibition decision, the CC 
cannot lawfully impose any remedies on Ryanair.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WILL APPEAL UKCC REPORT
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "This report by the UKCC is bizarre and manifestly wrong but also entirely expected.  From the first 
meeting with the UKCC it has been clear to us that Simon Polito's and Roger Davis' minds had been made up 
in advance and no truth or evidence was going to get in the way of their story.  This prejudicial approach 
to an Irish airline is very disturbing, coming from an English government body that regards itself a model 
competition authority.
 Polito's and Davis' ignoring of evidence, their conduct of a manifestly unfair investigation, their 
omission of all the substantial body of evidence that conclusively disproves their case, and their 
rejection of Ryanair's unprecedented undertakings (which patently address their three invented future 
concerns), all in a misguided pursuit of their pre-determined conclusion, demonstrate that this process 
was not a competition investigation but merely a corrupt and politically biased charade.
 While Ryanair is one of the UK's largest airlines, Aer Lingus has a tiny presence in the UK, serving just 
6 routes to the Republic of Ireland, a traffic base that has declined over the past 3 years and now 
accounts for less than 1% of all UK air traffic.  This case, involving two Irish airlines where one (Aer 
Lingus) accounts for less than 1% of the UK's total air traffic and concerns very few UK consumers, is yet 
another enormous waste of UK taxpayer resources from a body which took no action whatsoever when the two 
main UK airlines (BA and bmi) merged. It would appear to be a case of one rule for the UK airlines but an 
invented set of rules for two Irish airlines.
 In February 2013 the European Commission found that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has 
"intensified" since 2007.  The UKCC's failure to accept this finding is a breach of its legal duty of 
sincere cooperation between the UK and the EU competition authorities and will form the basis for 
Ryanair's appeal against this bizarre and manifestly unsound ruling, which our lawyers will lodge with the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal in the coming weeks."

 Ryanair required to sell down shareholding in Aer Lingus to 5%
 Dublin & London, 28 August 2013:  Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes the issue today by the UK 
Competition Commission ("CC") of its final report concluding its investigation into Ryanair's minority 
shareholding in Aer Lingus ("Final Report"). Following a detailed investigation the CC has concluded that 
Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus is anti-competitive and that it must sell down its 29.82% stake in 
Aer Lingus to 5%.
 The CC's press release and Final Report are linked below.

http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/our-work/directory-of-all-inquiries/ryanair-aer-
lingus
 The CC's Final Report also requires as follows:
 --      Ryanair may not re-acquire shares in Aer Lingus unless the European Commission grants clearance 
for an acquisition of control of Aer Lingus by Ryanair under the EU Merger Regulation;
 --      A divestiture trustee will be appointed to oversee the process of sale of Ryanair's shareholding 
in Aer Lingus, taking the divestiture process out of Ryanair's hands.
 Colm Barrington, Chairman of Aer Lingus, said:
 "Today's final report by the UK Competition Commission confirms that the minority shareholding in Aer 
Lingus held by our closest competitor, is anti-competitive and contrary to the interests of the 
approximately 14 million passengers who fly on routes between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  
The Competition Commission should be commended on its thorough investigation and we look forward to the 
implementation of its findings.
 It was unacceptable that our principal competitor was allowed to remain on our share register with a 
shareholding of 29.82% and interfere with our business despite the European Commission blocking both 
Ryanair's first hostile takeover attempt six years ago and its most recent hostile takeover attempt 
earlier this year.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Ryanair required to sell down shareholding
 Aer Lingus remains focussed on financial and operational performance and our recent results for the first 
half of 2013 demonstrate that Aer Lingus continues to deliver an excellent overall performance to the 
benefit of its shareholders.  The implementation of the Competition Commission's decision that Ryanair 
must reduce its anti-competitive shareholding will position Aer Lingus for future growth and opportunities 
which will make it an even stronger competitor in the market. "

 Special Business to be considered at the Annual General Meeting
 Your attention is drawn to the Notice of Meeting on pages 3 to 5 which sets out matters to be considered 
at the Annual General Meeting. In addition to the ordinary business there are four Resolutions relating to 
special business.
 Resolution 4 - Directors' Authority to Allot Ordinary Shares
 The Directors are seeking to renew their authority to allot shares in the authorised but unissued share 
capital of the Company for the period up to September 20, 2018.
 Resolution 5 - Disapplication of Statutory pre-emption Rights
 As was the case at previous years' Annual General Meetings, the Directors are seeking authority to allot 
Ordinary Shares without first offering them to existing shareholders in accordance with statutory pre-
emption rights where the Ordinary Shares are allotted:-
 (a)           on the exercise of any option in accordance with the provisions of the existing Ryanair 
Holdings plc Share Option Plans of 2000, 2003 and (subject to the passing of resolution 7) 2013;
 (b)           in connection with a rights issue; and
 (c)           otherwise than in pursuance of (a) and (b) above, up to an aggregate nominal value of the 
greater of EUR451,911 or 5% of the then issued share capital of the Company.
 It is proposed to renew this authority for the period expiring fifteen months from the passing of this 
Resolution or, if earlier, on the day following the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 Resolution 6 - Authority to Repurchase Shares
 At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on April 19, 2012 (the EGM) the Directors sought and obtained 
an amendment to the share repurchase authority granted at previous years' Annual General Meetings to allow 
the Company to repurchase shares from both the Ordinary Share pool and the American Depositary Share (the 
ADS) pool. The Directors are now seeking to renew the authority granted at the EGM.  Any ADSs repurchased 
will be converted to Ordinary Shares and cancelled as will Ordinary Shares repurchased, and the number of 
Ordinary Shares in issue will reduce accordingly.
 In line with the authority granted at the EGM, the maximum price at which Ordinary Shares traded on the 
Irish Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange could be repurchased would be the higher of (i) 5% above 
the average market value of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase and; (ii) the price stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) of December 22, 2003 (No. 2273/2003), being the higher of the last independent trade and 
the highest current independent bid on the trading venue on which the shares are being repurchased. It is 
further proposed that the maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADSs which 
are traded on NASDAQ could be repurchased would be 5% above the average market value of one-fifth of the 
Company's ADSs on NASDAQ for the five business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents 
five Ordinary Shares).
 The minimum price at which Ordinary Shares could be repurchased would be their nominal value of 0.635 
euro cents. The authority will also enable the Company to repurchase in US dollars or euro.
 Resolution 7 - Adoption of the Ryanair Share Option Plan 2013
 Resolution7 seeks the approval of shareholders for a new incentive plan, the Ryanair Share Option Plan 
2013 (the "Plan"), for senior employees and directors of the Group.
 The Board has decided, based on recommendations of the Remuneration Committee and subject to shareholder 
approval, to introduce the Plan to reward, retain and incentivise selected senior employees and directors.  
The Plan has been designed to align the interests of participants in the Plan with those of shareholders, 
to encourage participants to focus on the strategic objectives of the Company and in doing so achieve long 
term growth in shareholder value.  No share option grants were made since 2008 and having recently 
completed the Boeing Agreement to purchase 175 new aircraft over a five year period the Company believes 
that it is now appropriate to provide for new option grants that will reflect the financial and commercial 
targets it has set itself for the next five year period and beyond.
 The Plan will replace two stock option plans previously approved by shareholders (Option Plan 2000 and 
Option Plan 2003) for all future grants, as both of these plans have expired, although any subsisting 
options granted under Option Plan 2000 or Option Plan 2003 that have not yet lapsed will continue to be 
governed by the terms of those plans, as applicable.
 The principal features of the Plan are set out in Appendix 1 to this Notice.
 Recommendation of Directors
 The Directors believe that the passing of the Resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and the Directors unanimously recommend that you

vote in favour of such Resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings in 
Ordinary Shares which, as at the date of this letter, represent approximately 4.2% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman

 Appendix 1
 Summary of Plan
 Principal features of the Ryanair Share Option Plan 2013
 The Ryanair Share Option Plan 2013 ("the Plan") provides for the delivery of fully paid ordinary shares 
in Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") to selected senior employees and directors of the Company or its 
subsidiaries.  The awards are subject to a vesting period and the satisfaction of certain performance 
conditions, as outlined below.
 Basis of the Plan
 The Plan provides for the grant of options to acquire shares ("Options") to selected senior employees and 
directors.  The Options will give participants a right to acquire a predetermined number of shares at a 
price per share equal to the market value of a share at the date of grant, subject to a vesting period and 
the achievement of certain performance conditions.  During the vesting period participants will have no 
beneficial entitlement to the shares, and in particular no dividend or voting rights in respect of the 
shares.
 The Remuneration Committee will have responsibility for overseeing and administering the Plan.
 Participation in the Plan
 Any person who is a director or a senior employee of the Company or any subsidiary is eligible to 
participate. The Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion will be responsible for nominating an 
eligible person for participation in the Plan.  It is intended that grants of Options under the Plan will 
in practice be limited to key members of the senior management team and directors of the Company.
 Awards made under the Plan are not pensionable.
 Dilution Limits
 In any ten year period no more than five per cent of the Company's issued shares may be acquired pursuant 
to the Plan.
 Vesting and Performance Conditions
 All Options will be subject to a five year performance period beginning with the financial year in which 
a grant occurs.  There is an overriding time-based vesting condition such that even when designated 
performance targets are met, no Option will vest prior to the end of the fifth financial year comprising 
the performance period.
 The Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine the financial performance targets that must be met 
with respect to each financial year.  Those targets will relate directly to the achievement of certain 
year-on year growth targets in the Company's profit after tax figures for each of the five financial years 
of the performance period and/or certain share price targets.  Such targets will be appropriately 
challenging and will require a sustained and continuous improvement in the financial performance of the 
Company. The Remuneration Committee is committed to using a performance measurement package that is 
demanding and by setting Plan targets by reference to a five year performance period, the Remuneration 
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement -3-
Committee will ensure that senior management and directors who are considered key to the business will be 
appropriately incentivised to strive for and deliver long term benefits to shareholders.
 Profit after tax targets set in respect of a particular Option grant may be adjusted by the Remuneration 
Committee subsequently to take account of i) exceptional items recorded as such in the audited accounts of 
the Company for any financial year that falls into the performance period of that Option or ii) other 
extraordinary events that are outside of the Company's control and which have a material impact on the 
financial performance of the Company where such adjustment, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee 
(acting fairly and reasonably) is necessary to maintain the integrity and purpose of the Plan.
 The proportion of an Option that vests at the end of the five year performance period will be based on 
whether individual targets for each financial year are met, with twenty per cent of the Option vesting for 
each financial year's target that is met.  If a profit after tax target for an individual financial year 
is not met but the aggregate cumulative profit after tax target for the full five year period is met, the 
Option may still vest in full.  In certain circumstances, exceptional and sustained share price 
performance in excess of pre-determined targets set by the Remuneration Committee prior to an Option 
grant, during the five year performance period relating to that Option grant, may also result in such 
Option vesting in full at the end of the five year performance period.
 Options will lapse on the eighth anniversary of the date of grant, unless they lapse prior to that date 
on foot of any other provisions of the Plan.
 Transferability
 In general Options are not transferable save in the event of the death of a participant or where the 
Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion has determined that an Option granted to a participant 
may be transferred to family members of that participant or one or more trusts or other entities for the 
benefit of or owned by family members of that participant.
 Life of Plan
 No Options will be capable of being granted more than ten years after the date the Plan is approved by 
shareholders.

to an aggregate nominal amount equal to the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company at the 
conclusion of this meeting, and the authority hereby conferred shall expire at the close of business on 
September 20, 2018 unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the Company in general meeting provided

greater of EUR451,911 or 5% of the issued share capital of the Company,

meeting, expire 15 months from the passing of this Resolution or, if earlier, on the close of business on

save that the Company may, before such expiry, make an offer or agreement which would or might require

equity securities to be allotted after such expiry, and the Directors may allot equity securities in 
pursuance of such an offer or agreement as if the power conferred hereby had not expired."
 6.             To consider and if thought fit pass the following Resolution as a Special Resolution:-
 "That the Company and/or any subsidiary (as such expression is defined by Section 155 of the Companies 
Act, 1963) of the Company be and they are hereby generally authorised to make market purchases (as defined 
by Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1990) of the Company's Ordinary Shares on such terms and conditions 
and in such manner as the Directors or, as the case may be, the Directors of such subsidiary, may from 
time to time determine in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990 and the 
following restrictions and provisions:
 (i)            the maximum aggregate number of shares authorised to be acquired pursuant to this 
resolution shall not exceed 71.17  million Ordinary Shares;
 (ii)           the minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for any such Ordinary Share

shall not exceed the higher of:
A.   the higher of the price of the last independent
 trade and the highest current independent bid
 on the trading venue where the purchase is carried
 out, as stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission
 Regulation (EC) (No. 2273/2003) of December 22,
 2003 implementing the Market Abuse Directive
 2003/6/EC as regards exemptions for buy-back
 programmes and stabilisation of financial instruments;
 and
B.   105% of the average of the Relevant Price for
 such Ordinary Shares of the same class for each
 of the five (5) business days immediately preceding
 the day of the purchase of the Ordinary Shares;
 and
(iv)          for the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii)(B), "Relevant Price" means, in respect of the 
purchase of Ordinary Shares traded on the Irish Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange, on any 
business day on which there shall be a dealing in the Ordinary Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange (or any 
successor thereto) in respect of shares of the same class, the official closing price in respect of such 
shares as published in the Irish Stock Exchange Daily Official List or any successor publications thereto 
(the "ISE List") and, in respect of any business day on which there shall be no such dealing, the ISE 
Closing Mid-Market Price as derived from the ISE List;
 (v)           for the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii)(B), "Relevant Price" means, in respect of the 
purchase of Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Shares traded on NASDAQ, on any business day on 
which there shall be a dealing in ADSs on NASDAQ (or any successor thereto), one-fifth of the NASDAQ 
Official Close Price in respect of such ADSs as published by NASDAQ (or its equivalent if such a price is 
no longer published by NASDAQ) and, in respect of any business day on which there shall be no such 
dealing, one-fifth of the NASDAQ Official Open Price in respect of such ADSs on that day as published by 
NASDAQ (or its equivalent if such a price is no longer published by NASDAQ);
 (vi)          PROVIDED THAT if no ISE Closing Mid-Market Price is available on the Irish Stock Exchange, 
for the purposes of (iv) above for any particular day, then that day shall not count as one of the said 
five (5) business days for the purpose of determining the Relevant Price, and, at the discretion of the 
Directors, either another business day preceding the day of purchase of the shares on which such a price 
is available shall be substituted for such day, or the number of business days by reference to which the 
Relevant Price is to be calculated shall be reduced accordingly. If the means of providing the foregoing 
information as to dealings and prices, by reference to which the maximum price is to be determined, is 
altered or is replaced by some other means, then the maximum price shall be determined on the basis of the 
equivalent (as nearly as practicable) information published by the relevant authority in relation to 
dealings or, if no such information is available, by such other method as the Directors shall determine to 
be fair and reasonable;
 (vii)         for the purposes of this resolution the "ISE Closing Mid-Market Price" shall be the average 
of the closing best bid and the closing best offer as published on the ISE List; and
 (viii)        This authority will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting or 
15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution, unless previously varied, revoked or renewed in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 215 of the Companies Act, 1990. The Company or any subsidiary 
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement -2-
may before such expiry enter into a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares which would or might be 
wholly or partly executed after such expiry and may complete any such contract as if the authority 
conferred hereby had not expired."
 7.             To consider and, if thought fit, to pass the following resolution which will be proposed 
as an ordinary resolution:
 "That the Directors be and are hereby authorised to adopt and implement a new share option plan for the 
directors and senior employees of the Company (to be known as the Ryanair Share Option Plan 2013 ("the 
Plan")) which Plan will incorporate the provisions set out in the Plan summary attached as Appendix 1 to

 Unvested options will lapse on the date a participant ceases to be a director or employee except in the 
following circumstances:
 --      death;
 --      due to incapacity for health reasons;
 --      the company in which the participant holds his office or employment ceases to be a member of the 
Group;
 --      the business or part of the business to which the participant's employment or office relates has 
ceased to be owned by the Group; or
 --      any other reason in the Remuneration Committee's sole and absolute discretion.
 Where any of the above circumstances apply, the participant (or his legal personal representative, if 
applicable) may continue to hold an unvested Option until such time as it vests and is exercised or lapses 
pursuant to the terms of the Plan.  In exercising its discretion with respect to an unvested Option the 
Remuneration Committee will consider the extent to which performance criteria have been satisfied at the 
date of cessation and the period of time from the date of grant to the date of cessation relative to the 
entire vesting period, unless it deems that this is inappropriate in any particular case.
 A participant (or his legal personal representative, if applicable) may continue to hold an Option that 
has vested as at the date he ceases to be a director or employee for any reason and may exercise that 
Option at any time up to the date on which it lapses pursuant to the terms of the Plan.
 Adjustment on capitalisation, rights issue etc
 The terms of an Option may be adjusted on foot of any alteration taking place in the capital structure of 
the Company.
 Change in control
 In the event of a change in control of the Company (excluding any internal reorganisation) all Options 
vest. Alternatively, and with the agreement of the acquiring company, Options may be exchanged for new 
Options over shares in the acquiring company.
 Alterations
 Any material amendment to the advantage of participants in respect of the Option grant period, 
eligibility criteria, life of the Plan, dilution limits, determination of the Option price, change in 
control provisions, provisions allowing adjustments of Options in the event of share capital adjustments 
or provisions on a reconstruction or winding up requires the prior sanction of the Company in general 
meeting.
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement -4-
 No amendment to the disadvantage of participants in respect of rights already granted under the Plan may 
be made without the approval of such number of participants as hold the majority of shares under Option at 
that time.
 Copies of the rules of the proposed Plan referred to above are available for inspection at the registered 
office of the Company, Corporate Head Office, Dublin Airport, Co Dublin and at the office of A&L Goodbody 
Solicitors, 25-28 North Wall Quay, IFSC, Dublin 1, Ireland, during normal business hours on any weekday

 Ryanair currently conducts collective bargaining negotiations with groups of employees, including its pilots and 
cabin crew, regarding pay, work practices, and conditions of employment, through collective-bargaining units called 
"Employee Representation". In the U.K., BALPA (the U.K pilots union) unsuccessfully sought to represent Ryanair's 
U.K.-based pilots in their negotiations with Ryanair in 2001, at which time an overwhelming majority of those polled 
rejected BALPA's claim to represent them. On June 19, 2009, BALPA made a request for voluntary recognition 
under applicable U.K. legislation, which Ryanair rejected. BALPA had the option of applying to the U.K.'s Central 
Arbitration Committee (CAC) to organize a vote on union recognition by Ryanair's pilots in relevant bargaining units, 
as determined by the CAC, but BALPA decided not to proceed with an application at that time. The option to apply 
for a ballot remains open to BALPA and if it were to seek and be successful in such a ballot, it would be able to 
represent the U.K. pilots in negotiations over salaries and working conditions. Limitations on Ryanair's flexibility in 
dealing with its employees or the altering of the public's perception of Ryanair generally could have a material 
adverse effect on Ryanair's business, operating results, and financial condition. 
For additional details, see "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Staff and Labor Relations." 
Limitations on Ryanair's flexibility in dealing with its staff or the altering of the public's perception of Ryanair 
generally could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial 
condition.
 The Company is Dependent on External Service Providers. Ryanair currently assigns its engine overhauls and 
"rotable" repairs to outside contractors approved under the terms of Part 145, the European regulatory standard for 
aircraft maintenance established by the European Aviation Safety Agency ("Part 145"). The Company also assigns 
its passenger, aircraft and ground handling services at airports other than Dublin and certain airports in Spain and 
the Canary Islands to established external service providers. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Maintenance 
and 
Repairs-Heavy 
Maintenance" 
and 
"Item 
4. 
Information 
on 
the 
Company-Airport 
Operations3/4Airport Handling Services."
 The termination or expiration of any of Ryanair's service contracts or any inability to renew them or negotiate 
replacement contracts with other service providers at comparable rates could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company's results of operations. Ryanair will need to enter into airport service agreements in any new markets it 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -19-
enters, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain the necessary facilities and services at 
competitive rates. In addition, although Ryanair seeks to monitor the performance of external parties that provide 
passenger and aircraft handling services, the efficiency, timeliness, and quality of contract performance by external 
providers are largely beyond Ryanair's direct control. Ryanair expects to be dependent on such outsourcing 
arrangements for the foreseeable future.
 The Company is Dependent on Key Personnel. Ryanair's success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts 
and abilities of its senior management team, including Michael O'Leary, the Chief Executive Officer, and key 
financial, commercial, operating and maintenance personnel. Mr. O'Leary's current contract may be terminated by 
either party upon 12 months' notice.  See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Compensation of 
Directors and Senior Management-Employment and Bonus Agreement with Mr. O'Leary." Ryanair's success also 
depends on the ability of its executive officers and other members of senior management to operate and manage 
effectively, both independently and as a group. Although Ryanair's employment agreements with Mr. O'Leary and 
some of its other senior executives contain non-competition and non-disclosure provisions, there can be no 
assurance that these provisions will be enforceable in whole or in part. Competition for highly qualified personnel is 
intense, and either the loss of any executive officer, senior manager, or other key employee without adequate 
replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon Ryanair's 
business, operating results, and financial condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to its Internet Reservations Operations and its Announced Elimination of 
Airport Check-in Facilities. Over 99% of Ryanair's flight reservations are made through its website. Although 
Ryanair has established a contingency program whereby the website is hosted in three separate locations, each of 
these locations accesses the same booking engine, located at a single center, in order to make reservations.
 A back-up booking engine is available to Ryanair to support its existing platform in the event of a breakdown in this 
facility. Nonetheless, the process of switching over to the back-up engine could take some time and there can be no 
assurance that Ryanair would not suffer a significant loss of reservations in the event of a major breakdown of its 
booking engine or other related systems, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair's operating 
results or financial condition.
 Since October 1, 2009, all passengers have been required to use Internet check-in. Internet check-in is part of a 
package of measures intended to reduce check-in lines and passenger handling costs and pass on these savings 
by reducing passenger airfares. Ryanair has deployed this system across its network. Any disruptions to the 
Internet check-in service as a result of a breakdown in the relevant computer systems or otherwise could have a 
material adverse impact on these service-improvement and cost-reduction efforts. There can be no assurance, 
however, that this process will continue to be successful or that consumers will not switch to other carriers that 
provide standard check-in facilities, which would negatively affect Ryanair's results of operations and financial 
condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website. 
Screenscraper websites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair's website and booking system, extract flight and 
pricing information and display it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which include intermediary 
fees on top of Ryanair's fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and objects to the 
practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights, copyright 
protection, etc. Since November 2011, Ryanair has introduced a security screen check on its website which 
requires passengers who wish to book flights to enter a screen code to complete their bookings. This has had a 
positive impact and reduced the level of screenscraping. Ryanair is also involved in a number of legal proceedings 
against the proprietors of screenscraper websites in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and 
Switzerland. Ryanair's objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website, however Ryanair does allow 
certain companies who operate fare comparison (i.e. not reselling) websites to access the website provided they 
sign a license and use the agreed method to access the data. Ryanair has received favourable rulings in Ireland, 
Germany and The Netherlands, and unfavorable rulings in Spain, in its actions against screenscrapers. However, 
pending the outcome of these legal proceedings and if Ryanair were to be ultimately unsuccessful in them, the 
activities of screenscraper websites could lead to a reduction in the number of customers who book directly on 
Ryanair's website and consequently to a reduction in Ryanair's ancillary revenue stream. Also, some customers 
may be lost to Ryanair once they are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair fare inflated by the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -19-
screenscraper's intermediary fee. This could also adversely affect Ryanair's reputation as a low-fares airline, which 
could negatively affect Ryanair's results of operations and financial condition.
 For additional details, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Legal 
Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts."
 The Irish Corporation Tax Rate Could Rise. The majority of Ryanair's profits are subject to Irish corporation tax at a 
statutory rate of 12.5%. Due to the size and scale of the Irish government's budgetary deficit and the "bailout" of the 
Irish government by a combination of loans from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, there is 
a risk that the Irish government could increase Irish corporation tax rates above 12.5% in order to repay current or 
future loans or to increase tax revenues.
 At 12.5%, the rate of Irish corporation tax is lower than that applied by most of the other European Union member 
states, and has periodically been subject to critical comment by the governments of other EU member states. 
Although the Irish government has repeatedly publicly stated that it will not increase corporation tax rates, there can 
be no assurance that such an increase in corporation tax rates will not occur.
 In the event that the Irish government increases corporation tax rates or changes the basis of calculation of 
corporation tax from the present basis, any such changes would result in the Company paying higher corporate 
taxes and would have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.

 Management's objective is to schedule a sufficient number of flights per day on each of Ryanair's routes to satisfy 
demand for Ryanair's low-fares service. Ryanair schedules departures on its most popular routes at frequent 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -25-
intervals; normally between approximately 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. Management regularly reviews the need for 
adjustments in the number of flights on all of its routes.
 During the 2013 fiscal year, Ryanair announced 208 new routes across its network. See "Risk Factors-Risks 
Related to the Company-Ryanair's New Routes and Expanded Operations May Have an Adverse Financial Impact 
on Its Results."
 Low and Widely Available Fares
 Ryanair offers low fares, with prices generally varying on the basis of advance booking, seat availability and 
demand. Ryanair sells seats on a one-way basis, thus removing minimum stay requirements from all travel on 
Ryanair scheduled services. All tickets can be changed, subject to certain conditions, including fee payment and 
applicable upgrade charges. However, tickets are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable and must be paid 
for at the time of reservation.
 Ryanair's discounted fares are "capacity controlled" in that Ryanair allocates a specific number of seats on each 
flight to each fare category to accommodate projected demand for seats at each fare level leading up to flight time. 
Ryanair generally makes its lowest fares widely available by allocating a majority of its seat inventory to its lowest 
fare categories. Management believes that its unrestricted fares as well as its advance-purchase fares are attractive 
to both business and leisure travelers.
 When launching a new route, Ryanair's policy is to price its lowest fare so that it will be significantly lower than 
other carriers' lowest fares, but still provide a satisfactory operating margin.
 Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the opening of 
new routes, and endeavors to always offer the lowest fare on any route it serves. Promotional fares may have the 
effect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair's yield and passenger revenues on the relevant routes during 
the periods they are in effect. Ryanair expects to continue to offer significant fare promotions to stimulate demand in 
periods of lower activity or during off-peak times for the foreseeable future.
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
 Ryanair's primary marketing strategy is to emphasize its widely available low fares and price guarantee. In doing 
so, Ryanair primarily advertises its services in national and regional newspapers, as well as through controversial 
and topical advertising, press conferences and publicity stunts. Other marketing activities include the distribution of 
advertising and promotional material and cooperative advertising campaigns with other travel-related entities, 
including local tourist boards. Ryanair also regularly contacts people registered in its database to inform them about 
promotions and special offers via e-mail.
 RESERVATIONS ON RYANAIR.COM
 Passenger airlines generally rely on travel agents (whether traditional or online) for a significant portion of their 
ticket sales and pay travel agents commissions for their services, as well as reimbursing them for the fees charged 
by reservation systems providers. In contrast, Ryanair requires passengers to make reservations and purchase 
tickets directly through the Company. Over 99% of such reservations and purchases are made through the website 
Ryanair.com. Ryanair is therefore not reliant on travel agents. See "-Strategy-Taking Advantage of the Internet" 
above for additional information.
 In May 2012, Ryanair further upgraded its reservation system in order to facilitate the continued expansion of the 
airline.  The upgraded system gives the Company the ability to offer more enhancements to passengers, as the 
new platform is far more flexible in terms of future development. Under the agreement with the system provider, 
Navitaire, the system serves as Ryanair's core seating inventory and booking system. In return for access to these 
system functions, Ryanair pays transaction fees that are generally based on the number of passenger seat journeys 
booked through the system. Navitaire also retains a back-up booking engine to support operations in the event of a 
breakdown in the main system. Over the last several years, Ryanair has introduced a number of Internet-based 
customer service enhancements such as Internet check-in, priority boarding service and limited reserved seating 
since January 2012. Since October 2009, Ryanair has required Internet check-in for all passengers. These 
enhancements and changes have been made to reduce waiting time at airports and speed a passenger's journey 
from arrival at the airport to boarding, as well as significantly reduce airport handling costs. Ryanair has also 
introduced a checked-bag fee, which is payable on the Internet and is aimed at reducing the number of bags carried 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -25-
by passengers in order to further reduce handling costs. See Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Company-Ryanair Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website."
 AIRCRAFT
 Aircraft
 As of June 30, 2013, Ryanair's operating fleet was composed of 303 Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, 
each having 189 seats. Ryanair's fleet totaled 305 Boeing 737-800s at March 31, 2013. The Company expects to 
have an operating fleet comprising approximately 410 Boeing 737-800s at March 31, 2019 depending on the level 
of lease returns/disposals.
 Between March 1999 and March 2013, Ryanair took delivery of 348 new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft 
under its contracts with Boeing and disposed of 43 such aircraft, including 17 lease handbacks.
 Under the terms of the 2013 Boeing Contract, Ryanair has agreed to purchase the 175 New Aircraft over a five 
year period from fiscal 2015 to 2019, with delivery beginning in September 2014. The New Aircraft will benefit from 
a net effective price not dissimilar to that under the 2005 Boeing Contract which was approved by Shareholders in 
2005 and will be used on new and existing routes to grow Ryanair's business.
 The Boeing 737-800 represents the current generation of Boeing's 737 aircraft. It is a short-to-medium range 
aircraft and seats 189 passengers. The Basic Price (equivalent to a standard list price for an aircraft of this type) for 
each of the Boeing 737-800 series aircraft is approximately US$78.1 million and the Basic Price will be increased 
for certain "buyer-furnished" equipment, amounting to approximately US$2.9 million per New Aircraft, which Ryanair 
has asked Boeing to purchase and install on each of the New Aircraft. In addition, an "Escalation Factor" will be 
applied to the basic price to reflect increases in the Employment Cost Index and Producer Price Index between the 
time the basic price was set in the 2013 Boeing Contract and the period 18 to 24 months prior to the delivery of any 
such New Aircraft.
 Boeing has granted Ryanair certain price concessions as part of the 2013 Boeing Contract. These will take the 
form of credit memoranda to Ryanair for the amount of such concessions, which Ryanair may apply toward the 
purchase of goods and services from Boeing or toward certain payments, other than advance payments, in respect 
of the New Aircraft. Boeing and CFMI (the manufacturer of the engines to be fitted on the New Aircraft) have also 
agreed to provide Ryanair with certain allowances for promotional and other activities, as well as providing certain 
other goods and services to Ryanair on concessionary terms. Those credit memoranda and promotional allowances 
will effectively reduce the price of each New Aircraft payable by Ryanair. As a result, the "effective price" (the 
purchase price of the New Aircraft net of discounts received from Boeing) of each New Aircraft will be significantly 
below the basic price mentioned above. The effective price applies to all New Aircraft due for delivery from 
September 2014.

RISK FACTORS
 Risks Related to the Company
 Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse 
Impact to the Company's ProfitabilityJet fuel costs are subject to wide fluctuations as a result of many economic 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -15-
and political factors and events occurring throughout the world that Ryanair can neither control nor accurately 
predict, including increases in demand, sudden disruptions in supply and other concerns about global supply, as 
well as market speculation. For example, although they declined in the 2010 fiscal year, oil prices increased 
substantially in fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013 and remain at elevated levels. As international prices for jet fuel 
are denominated in U.S. dollars, Ryanair's fuel costs are also subject to certain exchange rate risks. Substantial 
price increases, adverse exchange rates, or the unavailability of adequate fuel supplies, including, without limitation, 
any such events resulting from international terrorism, prolonged hostilities in the Middle East or other oil-producing 
regions or the suspension of production by any significant producer, may adversely affect Ryanair's profitability. In 
the event of a fuel shortage resulting from a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, additional increases in fuel prices 
or a curtailment of scheduled services could result.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a more 
selective basis. As of July 26, 2013, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering 
approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 at prices equivalent to 
approximately $980 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 26, 2013, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 75% of its estimated requirements for the first half of the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2015 at prices equivalent to approximately $935 per metric ton, and had not entered into any jet 
fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period. Because of the limited nature 
of its hedging program, Ryanair is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the price of fuel, and movements in 
the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, especially in light of the recent volatility in the relevant currency and commodity 
markets. Any further increase in fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair's financial performance. 
In addition, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro could have an adverse effect on the cost of buying 
fuel in euro. As of July 26, 2013, Ryanair had hedged approximately 90% of its forecasted fuel-related dollar 
purchases against the euro at a rate of approximately $1.31 per euro for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 and 
approximately 85% of its forecasted fuel related dollar purchases against the euro at a rate of approximately $1.32 
per euro for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015.
 No assurances whatsoever can be given about trends in fuel prices, and average fuel prices for future years may 
be significantly higher than current prices. Management estimates that every $10 movement in the price of a metric 
ton of jet fuel will impact Ryanair's costs by approximately EUR17.1 million, taking into account Ryanair's hedging 
programme for the 2014 fiscal year. There can be no assurance, however, in this regard, and the impact of fuel 
prices on Ryanair's operating results may be more pronounced. There also cannot be any assurance that Ryanair's 
current or any future arrangements will be adequate to protect Ryanair from increases in the price of fuel or that 
Ryanair will not incur losses due to high fuel prices, either alone or in combination with other factors. Because of 
Ryanair's low fares and its no-fuel-surcharges policy, as well as Ryanair's expansion plans, which could have a 
negative impact on yields, its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to passengers through increased fares or 
otherwise is somewhat limited. Moreover, the anticipated expansion of Ryanair's fleet from September 2014 
onwards will result in an increase, in absolute terms, in Ryanair's aggregate fuel costs.
 Ryanair Has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft. In recent years, in response to an operating environment 
characterized by high fuel prices, typically lower winter yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, Ryanair has 
adopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its fleet during the winter months (from November to March). In 
the winter of fiscal year 2013, Ryanair grounded approximately 80 aircraft and the Company intends to again 
ground approximately 60 aircraft in the coming winter. Ryanair's adoption of the policy of seasonally grounding 
aircraft presents some risks. While Ryanair seeks to implement its seasonal grounding policy in a way that will allow 
it to reduce losses by operating flights during periods of high oil prices to high cost airports at low winter yields, 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful.

 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 Legal Proceedings
 The Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Although no 
assurance can be given as to the outcome of any current or pending litigation, management does not believe 
that any of such litigation will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
results of operations or financial condition of the Company, except as otherwise described below.
 EU State Aid-Related Proceedings. On December 11, 2002, the European Commission announced the launch of 
an investigation into the 2001 agreement among Ryanair, the Brussels (Charleroi) airport and the 
government of the Walloon Region of Belgium, the owner of the airport, which enabled the Company to launch 
new routes and base up to four aircraft at Brussels (Charleroi). The European Commission's investigation 
was based on an anonymous complaint alleging that Ryanair's arrangements with Brussels (Charleroi) 
constituted illegal state aid.
 The European Commission issued its decision on February 12, 2004. As regards the majority of the 
arrangements between Ryanair, the airport and the region, the European Commission found that although they 
constituted state aid, they were nevertheless compatible with the EC Treaty provisions and therefore did 
not require repayment. However, the European Commission also found that certain other arrangements did 
constitute illegal state aid and therefore ordered Ryanair to repay the amount of the benefit received in 
connection with those arrangements. On April 20, 2004, the Walloon Region wrote to Ryanair requesting 
repayment of such state aid, although it acknowledged that Ryanair could offset against the amount of such 
state aid certain costs incurred in relation to the establishment of the base, in accordance with the 
European Commission's decision. Ryanair made the requested repayment.
 On May 25, 2004, Ryanair appealed the decision of the European Commission to the CFI, requesting the 
court to annul the decision because:
 --      the European Commission infringed Article 253 of the EC Treaty by failing to provide adequate 
reasons for its decision; and
 --      the European Commission misapplied Article 87 of the EC Treaty by failing to properly apply the 
Market Economy Investor Principle (MEIP), which generally holds that an investment made by a public entity 
that would have been made on the same basis by a private entity does not constitute state aid.
 In March 2008, Ryanair had its hearing before the CFI, and in December 2008, the CFI annulled the 
European Commission's decision, and Ryanair was repaid the EUR4 million that the Commission had claimed 
was illegal state aid. The Belgian government has also withdrawn a separate EUR2.3 million action against 
Ryanair arising from the European Commission's decision.
 In January 2010, the European Commission concluded that the financial arrangements between Bratislava 
airport in Slovakia and Ryanair do not constitute state aid within the meaning of EU rules, because these 
arrangements were in line with market terms. In July 2012, the European Commission similarly concluded 
that the financial arrangements between Tampere airport in Finland and Ryanair do not constitute state 
aid.
 Ryanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports, 
notably Lübeck, Berlin (Schönefeld), Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Frankfurt (Hahn), Dusseldorf (Weeze), 
Zweibrücken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, (Stockholm) Vasteras, Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, 
Nimes, Angouleme, Marseille, Cagliari and Brussels (Charleroi). These investigations are ongoing and 
Ryanair currently expects that they will conclude in late 2013/early 2014, with any European Commission 
decisions appealable to the EU General Court.
 State aid complaints by Lufthansa about Ryanair's cost base at Frankfurt (Hahn) have been rejected by 
German courts, as have similar complaints by Air Berlin in relation to Ryanair's arrangement with Lubeck 
airport, but following a German Supreme Court ruling on a procedural issue in early 2011, these cases will 
be re-heard by lower courts. The court case regarding Frankfurt (Hahn) airport has been referred by the 
German courts to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which will make a ruling on the discretion 
national courts have in state aid proceedings running in parallel with European Commission investigations 
regarding the same airport. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union is expected within 
one year and will be binding on all EU national courts. In addition, Ryanair has been involved in legal 
challenges including allegations of state aid at Alghero and Marseille airports. The Alghero case 
(initiated by Air One) was dismissed in its entirety in April 2011. The Marseille case was withdrawn by 
the plaintiffs (subsidiaries of Air France) in May 2011.
 In September 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and the 
provision of start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports, based on the European Commission's 
finding in the Brussels (Charleroi) case, which Ryanair successfully appealed. The guidelines apply only 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -46-
to publicly owned regional airports, and place restrictions on the incentives these airports can offer 
airlines to deliver traffic. The guidelines apply only in cases in which the terms offered by a public 
airport are in excess of what a similar private airport would have offered. Ryanair deals with airports, 
both public and private, on an equal basis and receives the same cost agreements from both. The guidelines 
have therefore had no impact on Ryanair's business, although they have caused significant uncertainty in 
the industry in relation to what public airports may or may not do in order to attract traffic.
 Ryanair believes that the positive decision by the CFI in the Brussels (Charleroi) case has caused the 
European Commission to rethink its policy in this area. Ryanair believes that the CFI's findings should be 
addressed in the ongoing revision of the guidelines, whereby the European Commission announced on July 3, 
2013 that it would finalize this revision by early 2014. However, adverse rulings in the above or similar 
cases could be used as precedents by other competitors to challenge Ryanair's agreements with other 
publicly owned airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly reconsider its growth strategy in relation to 
public or state-owned airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a scaling back of Ryanair's 
growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately owned airports available for development. No 
assurance can be given as to the outcome of these proceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable outcomes 
may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or 
financial condition of the Company.
 In November 2007, Ryanair initiated proceedings in the CFI against the European Commission for its 
failure to take action on a number of state aid complaints Ryanair had submitted against Air France, 
Lufthansa, Alitalia, Volare and Olympic Airways. Following the European Commission's subsequent findings 
that illegal state aid had been provided to Air France and Olympic Airways, Ryanair withdrew the two 
relevant proceedings. The case related to Lufthansa concluded with the EU General Court's ruling in May 
2011, in which the Court found that while the European Commission has not failed to act, it has 
unreasonably delayed the launch of the investigation, which justified Ryanair's action for failure to act. 
Consequently, the Court ordered the European Commission to pay 50% of Ryanair's costs in the proceedings. 
Similarly, in October 2011, the General Court found that the European Commission has failed to act on 
Ryanair's 2005-2006 complaints against state aid to Alitalia. The European Commission appealed the ruling 
to the Court of Justice of the European Union, and on May 16, 2013, the European Commission's appeal was 
rejected.

 Additionally, Ryanair's growth has been largely dependent on increasing summer capacity, and decreasing winter 
capacity may affect the overall future growth of Ryanair. Further, while seasonal grounding does reduce Ryanair's 
variable operating costs, it does not avoid fixed costs such as aircraft ownership costs and some staff costs, and it 
also decreases Ryanair's potential to earn ancillary revenues. Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may 
also negatively affect Ryanair's labor relations, including its ability to attract flight personnel only interested in full-
time employment. Such risks could lead to negative effects on Ryanair's financial condition and/or results of 
operations.
 Risks Associated with the Euro. The Company is headquartered in Ireland and its reporting currency is the euro. 
As a result of the ongoing uncertainty arising from the Eurozone debt crisis, in 2012 there was widespread 
speculation that some member states could exit the Eurozone or that there may be a potential break-up of the 
Eurozone currency union, including with regard to Ireland, the country in which the Company is headquartered. If a 
Eurozone participating member state were to leave the Eurozone, there is a risk of contagion spreading to the 
remaining members. Ryanair predominantly operates to/from countries within the Eurozone and has significant 
operational and financial exposures to the Eurozone that could result in a reduction in the operating performance of 
Ryanair or the devaluation of certain assets. Ryanair has taken certain risk management measures to minimize any 
disruptions, however these risk management measures may fail to address the potential fall-out from a break-up of 
the euro or an exit by one, or more, of the Eurozone members.
 The Company has cash and aircraft assets and debt liabilities that are denominated in euro on its balance sheet. In 
addition, the positive/negative mark-to-market value of derivative-based transactions are recorded in euro as either 
assets or liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. A potential exit of a member state or the break-up of the 
Eurozone could have a materially adverse effect on the value of these assets and liabilities. In addition to the assets 
and liabilities on Ryanair's balance sheet, the Company has a number of cross currency risks as a result of the 
jurisdictions of the operating business including non-euro revenues, fuel costs, certain maintenance costs and 
insurance costs. A weakening in the value of the euro primarily against U.K. pound sterling and U.S. dollar, but also 
against other non-Eurozone European currencies and Moroccan Dirhams, could negatively impact the operating 
results of the Company.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -16-
 Recession, austerity and the possible breakup of the euro could also mean that Ryanair is unable to grow. The 
current European recession and austerity measures introduced within Europe all mean that Ryanair may be unable 
to expand its operations due to lack of demand for air travel. Furthermore, the possible breakup of the euro and 
resulting financial crisis could also lead to a dampening of demand for air travel.
 Currency Fluctuations Affect the Company's Results. Although the Company is headquartered in Ireland, a 
significant portion of its operations are conducted in the U.K. Consequently, the Company has significant operating 
revenues and operating expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, denominated in U.K. pounds sterling. In 
addition, fuel, aircraft, insurance, and some maintenance obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. The 
Company's operations and financial performance can therefore be significantly affected by fluctuations in the values 
of the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar. Ryanair is particularly vulnerable to direct exchange rate risks 
between the euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its operating costs are incurred in U.S. dollars 
and none of its revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.
 Although the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions between the euro and the U.S. dollar, 
between the euro and the U.K. pound sterling, and between the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, hedging 
activities cannot be expected to eliminate currency risks. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk."
 The Company May Not Be Successful in Increasing Fares and Revenues to Offset Higher Business Costs. Ryanair 
operates a low-fares airline. The success of its business model depends on its ability to control costs so as to 
deliver low fares while at the same time earning a profit. Ryanair has limited control over its fuel costs and already 
has comparatively low operating costs. In periods of high fuel costs, if Ryanair is unable to further reduce its other 
operating costs or generate additional revenues, operating profits are likely to fall. Ryanair cannot offer any 
assurances regarding its future profitability. Changes in fuel costs and fuel availability could have a material 
adverse impact on Ryanair's results and could also increase the likelihood that Ryanair may incur losses. See "-The 
Company Faces Significant Price and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment" below and "-Changes 
in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse Impact to 
the Company's Profitability" above.
 The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports. Formal investigations are 
ongoing by the European Commission into Ryanair's agreements with the Lübeck, Berlin (Schönefeld), Alghero, 
Pau, Aarhus, Frankfurt (Hahn), Dusseldorf (Weeze), Zweibrücken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, Stockholm (Vasteras), 
Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, Nimes, Angouleme, Marseille, Brussels (Charleroi) and Cagliari 
airports. The investigations seek to determine whether the arrangements constitute illegal state aid under EU law. 
The investigations are expected to be completed in late 2013/early 2014, with the European Commission's 
decisions being appealable to the EU General Court. Investigations into Ryanair's agreements with the Bratislava 
and Tampere airports concluded respectively in 2010 and 2012 with findings that these agreements contained no 
state aid. In addition to the European Commission investigations, Ryanair is facing allegations that it has benefited 
from unlawful state aid in a number of court cases, including in relation to its arrangements with Frankfurt (Hahn) 
and Lübeck airports. The court case regarding Frankfurt (Hahn) airport has been referred by the German courts to 
the Court of Justice of the European Union, which will make a ruling on the discretion national courts have in state 
aid proceedings running in parallel with European Commission investigations regarding the same airport. The ruling 
of the Court of Justice of the European Union is expected within one year and will be binding on all EU national 
courts. Adverse rulings in the above state aid matters could be used as precedents by competitors to challenge 
Ryanair's agreements with other publicly owned airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly reconsider its growth 
strategy in relation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a scaling-back of 
Ryanair's overall growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately owned airports available for development.
 On July 25, 2012, the European Commission decided that Ryanair, along with Aer Lingus and Aer Arann, had been 
in receipt of unlawful state aid from the Irish government as a result of being an identified beneficiary of the two-tier 
air travel tax in place for flights departing from Irish airports between March 2009 and March 2011. Ryanair was the 
original complainant to the European Commission, alleging that the air travel tax favored Aer Arann and Aer Lingus.  
Ryanair appealed the decision of the European Commission to the EU General Court on November 14, 2012.  
Judgment is expected within 18-24 months of the date of filing.  The EU General Court may affirm or annul the 
European Commission decision.  The Irish State is obliged to recover the unlawful state aid from Ryanair before the 
Irish courts notwithstanding Ryanair's appeal of the EU Commission decision, and initiated its claim in April 2013.  
The Irish State is seeking approximately EUR12 million plus interest from Ryanair in these proceedings.  Ryanair 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -16-
has also issued proceedings before the Irish courts for recovery of the entire amount of the air travel tax paid during 
the period March 2009 - March 2011 on the basis of the two-tier nature of the tax being unlawful under EU law.  
Ryanair is seeking approximately EUR88 million from the Irish State in these proceedings.
 No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these legal proceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable 
outcomes may, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial 
condition of Ryanair.
 For additional information, please see "Item 8. Financial Information3/4Other Financial Information3/4Legal 
Proceedings."
 The Company Faces Significant Price and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment. Ryanair operates 
in a highly competitive marketplace, with a number of low-fare, traditional and charter airlines competing throughout 
its route network. Airlines compete primarily in respect of fare levels, frequency and dependability of service, name 
recognition, passenger amenities (such as access to frequent flyer programmes), and the availability and 
convenience of other passenger services. Unlike Ryanair, certain competitors are state-owned or state-controlled 
flag carriers and in some cases may have greater name recognition and resources and may have received, or may 
receive in the future, significant amounts of subsidies and other state aid from their respective governments. In 
addition, the EU-U.S. Open Skies Agreement, which came into effect in March 2008, allows U.S. carriers to offer 
services in the intra-EU market, which could eventually result in increased competition in the EU market.  See "Item

 significantly or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from accidents. Ryanair's insurance does 
not cover claims for losses incurred when, due to unforeseen events, airspace is closed and aircraft are grounded, 
such as the airspace closures described on page 53, which resulted from volcanic ash in the northern European 
airspace during April and May 2010.
 The cost of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or terrorism increased 
dramatically as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In the immediate aftermath, aircraft liability war 
indemnities for amounts above $50 million were, in the absence of any alternative coverage, provided by the Irish 
Government at pre-September 11, 2001 levels of coverage on the basis of a per-passenger surcharge. In March 
2002, once such coverage was again commercially available, Ryanair arranged coverage to replace that provided 
by the government indemnity. The replacement insurance coverage operated on the basis of a per-passenger 
surcharge with an additional surcharge based on hull values. Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the 
Company's current war-related insurance coverage may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, which may 
result in the Company seeking alternative coverage. Ryanair to date has passed increased insurance costs on to 
passengers by means of a special "insurance levy" on each ticket.
 During the 2006 fiscal year, Ryanair established Aviation Insurance (IOM) Limited ("AIL"), a wholly owned 
insurance company subsidiary, to provide the Company with self-insurance as part of its ongoing risk-management 
strategy. AIL underwrites a portion of the Company's aviation insurance program, which covers not only the 
Company's aircraft but also its liability to passengers and to third parties. AIL reinsures virtually all of the aviation 
insurance risk it underwrites with recognized third parties in the aviation reinsurance market, with the amount of 
AIL's maximum aggregate exposure not currently subject to such reinsurance agreements being equal to 
approximately $16.5 million. In addition to aviation insurance, AIL has underwritten most of the single trip travel 
insurance policies sold on Ryanair.com since February 1, 2011.
 Council Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002, governs air carrier 
liability. This legislation provides for unlimited liability of an air carrier in the event of death or bodily injuries suffered 
by passengers, implementing the Warsaw Convention of 1929 for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to 
Transportation by Air, as amended by the Montreal Convention of 1999. Ryanair has extended its liability insurance 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -29-
to meet the appropriate requirements of the legislation. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Airline Industry-The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability" for information on the Company's risks of 
loss and liability.

Ryanair has agreements with the DAA, the Irish government authority charged with operating Dublin Airport, 
to lease bag-drop counters and other space at the passenger and cargo terminal facilities at Dublin 
Airport. The airport office facilities used by Ryanair at London (Stansted) are leased from the airport 
authority; similar facilities at each of the other airports Ryanair serves are provided by Servisair plc 
or other service providers.
 TRADEMARKS
 Ryanair's logo and the slogans "Ryanair.com The Low Fares Website" and "Ryanair The Low Fares Airline" 
have been registered as Community Trade Marks ("CTMs"). Ryanair has also registered the CTM for the word 
"Ryanairhotels.com." A CTM allows a trademark owner to obtain a single registration of its trademark, 
which registration affords uniform protection for that trademark in all EU member states. The registration 
gives Ryanair an exclusive monopoly over the use of its trade name with regard to similar services and the 
right to sue for trademark infringement should another party use an identical or confusingly similar 
trademark in relation to identical, or similar services.
 Ryanair has not registered either its name or its logo as a trademark in Ireland, as CTM-registration 
provides all of the protection available from an Irish registration, and management believes there are 
therefore no advantages in making a separate Irish application.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market
 Ryanair began its flight operations in 1985, during a decade in which the governments of Ireland and the 
U.K. liberalized the bilateral arrangements for the operation of air services between the two countries. 
In 1992, the Council of Ministers of the EU adopted a package of measures intended to liberalize the 
internal market for air transportation in the EU. The liberalization included measures that allow EU air 
carriers substantial freedom to set air fares, provided EU air carriers greatly enhanced access to routes 
within the EU, and also introduced a licensing procedure for EU air carriers. Beginning in April 1997, EU 
air carriers have generally been able to provide passenger services on domestic routes within any EU 
member state outside their home country of operations without restriction.

 Volcanic emissions may happen again and could lead to further significant flight cancellation costs which could 
have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, 
volcanic emissions (whether from current or new sources) or similar atmospheric disturbances and resulting 
cancellations due to the closure of airports could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial 
performance indirectly, as a consequence of changes in the public's willingness to travel within Europe due to the 
risk of flight disruptions.
 Any Significant Outbreak of any Airborne Disease, Including Swine Flu or Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Could 
Significantly Damage Ryanair's Business. Worldwide, there has, from time to time, been substantial publicity in 
recent years regarding certain potent influenza viruses and other disease epidemics. Publicity of this type may have 
a negative impact on demand for air travel in Europe. Past outbreaks of SARS, foot-and-mouth disease, avian flu 
and swine flu have adversely impacted the travel industries, including aviation, in certain regions of the world, 
including Europe. The Company believes that if any influenza or other pandemic becomes severe in Europe, its 
effect on demand for air travel in the markets in which Ryanair operates could be material, and it could therefore 
have a significantly adverse impact on the Company. A severe outbreak of swine flu, SARS, foot-and-mouth 
disease, avian flu or another pandemic or livestock-related disease also may result in European or national 
authorities imposing restrictions on travel, further damaging Ryanair's business. A serious pandemic could therefore 
severely disrupt Ryanair's business, resulting in the cancellation or loss of bookings, and adversely affecting 
Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations.
 The Company is Dependent on the Continued Acceptance of Low-fares Airlines. In past years, accidents or other 
safety-related incidents involving certain low-fares airlines have had a negative impact on the public's acceptance of 
such airlines. Any adverse event potentially relating to the safety or reliability of low-fares airlines (including 
accidents or negative reports from regulatory authorities) could adversely impact the public's perception of, and 
confidence in, low-fares airlines like Ryanair, and could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair's financial 
condition and results of operations.
 Terrorism in the United Kingdom or Elsewhere in Europe Could Have a Material Detrimental Effect on the 
Company. On August 10, 2006, U.K. security authorities arrested and subsequently charged eight individuals in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -21-
connection with an alleged plot to attack aircraft operating on transatlantic routes. As a result of these arrests, U.K. 
authorities introduced increased security measures, which resulted in all passengers being body-searched, and a 
ban on the transportation in carry-on baggage of certain liquids and gels. The introduction of these measures led to 
passengers suffering severe delays while passing through these airport security checks. As a result, Ryanair 
cancelled 279 flights in the days following the incident and refunded a total of EUR2.7 million in fares to 
approximately 40,000 passengers. In the days following the arrests, Ryanair also suffered reductions in bookings 
estimated to have resulted in the loss of approximately EUR1.9 million of additional revenue. As in the past, the 
Company reacted to these adverse events by initiating system-wide fare sales to stimulate demand for air travel.
 In addition, reservations on Ryanair's flights to London dropped materially for a number of days in the immediate 
aftermath of the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005. Although the terrorist attack in Glasgow on June 30, 
2007 and the failed terrorist attacks in London on July 21, 2005 and June 29, 2007 had no material impact on 
bookings, there can be no assurance that future such attacks will not affect passenger traffic. In the 2013 fiscal 
year, 15.9 million passengers were booked on Ryanair's flights into and out of London, representing 20.1% of the 
total passengers booked on all of the Company's flights in the fiscal year. Future acts of terrorism or significant 
terrorist threats, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company's profitability or financial condition should the public's willingness to travel to and 
from those markets decline as a result. See also "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe 
Negative Impact on the International Airline Industry" below.
 The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline 
Industry. The terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, in which four commercial aircraft were 
hijacked, had a severe negative impact on the international airline industry, particularly on U.S. carriers and carriers 
operating international services to and from the United States. Although carriers such as Ryanair that operate 
primarily or exclusively in Europe were generally spared from such material adverse impacts on their businesses, 
the cost to all commercial airlines of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or 
terrorism increased dramatically after the September 11 attacks. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Insurance." In addition, Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the Company's current "act of war"-
related insurance may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, such as certain forms of biological, chemical 
or "dirty bomb" attacks. This could result in the Company's seeking alternative coverage, including government 
insurance or self-insurance, which could lead to further increases in costs. Although Ryanair to date has passed on 
increased insurance costs to passengers by means of a special "insurance levy" on each ticket, there can be no 
assurance that it will continue to be successful in doing so.
 Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is discretionary and because Ryanair is 
substantially dependent on discretionary air travel, any prolonged general reduction in airline passenger traffic may 
adversely affect the Company. Similarly, any significant increase in expenses related to security, insurance or 
related costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Any further terrorist attacks in the U.S. or in 
Europe, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, any significant military actions by the 
United States or EU nations or any related economic downturn may have a material adverse effect on demand for 
air travel and thus on Ryanair's business, operating results, and financial condition. See also "-Terrorism in the 
United Kingdom or Elsewhere in Europe Could have a Material Detrimental Effect on the Company."
 The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability. Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be 
incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs 
related to the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from 
service. In addition, an accident or incident could result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured 
passengers and others who experienced injury or property damage as a result of the accident or incident, including 
ground victims. Ryanair currently maintains passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, aircraft 
insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts per occurrence that are consistent 
with industry standards.
 Ryanair currently believes its insurance coverage is adequate (although not comprehensive). However, there can 
be no assurance that the amount of insurance coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance premiums will 
not increase significantly, or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from any accidents not 
covered by its insurance. Airline insurance costs increased dramatically following the September 2001 terrorist 
attacks on the United States. See "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact 
on the International Airline Industry" above. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of related 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -21-
insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial 
condition. Moreover, any aircraft accident, even if fully insured, could lead to the public perception that Ryanair's 
aircraft were less safe or reliable than those operated by other airlines, which could have a material adverse effect 
on Ryanair's business.
 EU Regulation No. 2027/97, as amended by Regulation No. 889/2002, governs air carrier liability. See "Item 4. 
Information on the Company-Insurance" for details of this regulation. This regulation increased the potential liability 
exposure of air carriers such as Ryanair. Although Ryanair has extended its liability insurance to meet the 
requirements of the regulation, no assurance can be given that other laws, regulations, or policies will not be 
applied, modified or amended in a manner that has a material adverse effect on Ryanair's business, operating 
results, and financial condition.

Body
 On September 6, 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and 
start-up aid to airlines by regional airports based on its February 2004 finding in the Charleroi case, a decision that 
the Court of First Instance ("CFI") has since annulled in December 2008. The guidelines only apply to publicly 
owned regional airports, and place restrictions on the incentives that these airports can offer airlines to deliver 
traffic. Ryanair believes that the CFI's annulment of the Charleroi decision severely undermines these guidelines. In 
April 2011, the European Commission launched a consultation on the revision of the 2005 guidelines. In May 2013, 
the European Commission launched a further consultation on the revision of the 2005 guidelines, a final revised 
version of which is expected to be published in the second half of 2013. However, no assurance can be given that 
the revised guidelines will better reflect the commercial reality of the liberalized air transport market and 
consequently allow public airports to offer similar incentives to those offered by private airports.
 The European Union also adopted legislation on airport charges (EU Directive 2009/12), which was originally 
intended to address abusive pricing at monopoly airports. However, the legislation includes all European airports 
with over five million passengers per year. Management believes that this will likely increase the administrative 
burdens on smaller airports and may lead to higher airport charges, while the scope that exists within this Directive 
to address abuses of their dominant positions by Europe's larger airports is very limited. See "Item 7. Major 
Shareholders and Related-Party Transactions 3/4Other Financial Information3/4Legal Proceedings3/4EU State Aid-
Related Proceedings."
 The European Union also passed legislation calling for increased transparency in airline fares, which requires the 
inclusion of all mandatory taxes, fees, and charges in advertised prices. Ryanair currently includes this information 
in its advertised fares in all markets where it operates. However, certain regulatory authorities have alleged that 
some fees applied by airlines, including Ryanair, on an avoidable basis are in fact mandatory. Ryanair amended its 
website to include information on fees in June 2012 and incorporated further changes to meet these requirements 
on its website in August 2012 and December 2012.
 Registration of Aircraft
 Pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order 2002 (the "Order"), the IAA 
regulates the registration of aircraft in Ireland. In order to be registered or continue to be registered in Ireland, an 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -31-
aircraft must be wholly owned by either (i) a citizen of Ireland or a citizen of another member state of the EU having 
a place of residence or business in Ireland or (ii) a company registered in and having a place of business in Ireland 
and having its principal place of business in Ireland or another member state of the EU and not less than two-thirds 
of the directors of which are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. As of the date of this report, 
nine of the ten directors of Ryanair Holdings are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. An aircraft 
will also fulfill these conditions if it is wholly owned by such citizens or companies in combination. Notwithstanding 
the fact that these particular conditions may not be met, the IAA retains discretion to register an aircraft in Ireland so 
long as it is in compliance with the other conditions for registration under the Order. Any such registration may, 
however, be made subject to certain conditions. In order to be registered, an aircraft must also continue to comply 
with any applicable provisions of Irish law. The registration of any aircraft can be cancelled if it is found that it is not 
in compliance with the requirements for registration under the Order and, in particular: (i) if the ownership 
requirements are not met; (ii) if the aircraft has failed to comply with any applicable safety requirements specified by 
the IAA in relation to the aircraft or aircraft of a similar type; or (iii) if the IAA decides in any case that it is not in the 
public interest for the aircraft to remain registered in Ireland.
 Regulation of Competition
 Competition/Antitrust Law. It is a general principle of EU competition law that no agreement may be concluded 
between two or more separate economic undertakings that prevents, restricts or distorts competition in the common 
market or any part of the common market. Such an arrangement may nevertheless be exempted by the European 
Commission, on either an individual or category basis. The second general principle of EU competition law is that 
any business or businesses having a dominant position in the EU common market or any substantial part of the 
common market may not abuse such dominant position. Ryanair is subject to the application of the general rules of 
EU competition law as well as specific rules on competition in the airline sector.
 An aggrieved person may sue for breach of EU competition law in the courts of a member state and/or petition the 
European Commission for an order to put an end to the breach of competition law. The European Commission also 
may impose fines and daily penalties on businesses and the courts of the member states may award damages and 
other remedies (such as injunctions) in appropriate circumstances.
 Competition law in Ireland is primarily embodied in the Competition Act 2002. This Act is modeled on the EU 
competition law system. The Irish rules generally prohibit anti-competitive arrangements among businesses and 
prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. These rules are enforced either by public enforcement (primarily by the 
Competition Authority) through both criminal and civil sanctions or by private action in the courts. These rules apply 
to the airline sector, but are subject to EU rules that override any contrary provisions of Irish competition law. 
Ryanair has been subject to an abuse-of-dominance investigation by the Irish Competition Authority in relation to 
service between Dublin and Cork. The Competition Authority closed its investigation in July 2009 with a finding in 
favor of Ryanair.
 State Aid. The EU rules control aid granted by member states to businesses on a selective or discriminatory basis. 
The EU Treaty prevents member states from granting such aid unless approved in advance by the EU. Any such 
grant of state aid to an airline is subject to challenge before the EU or, in certain circumstances, national courts. If 
aid is held to have been unlawfully granted it may have to be repaid by the airline to the granting member state, 
together with interest thereon. See "Item 3. Key Information3/4Risk Factors3/4Risks Related to the Company-The 
Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports"and "Item 8. Financial 
Information3/4Other Financial Information3/4Legal Proceedings."
 Environmental Regulation
 Aircraft Noise Regulations. Ryanair is subject to international, national and, in some cases, local noise regulation 
standards. EU and Irish regulations have required that all aircraft operated by Ryanair comply with Stage 3 noise 
requirements since April 1, 2002. All of Ryanair's aircraft currently comply with these regulations. Certain airports in 
the U.K. (including London Stansted and London Gatwick) and continental Europe have established local noise 
restrictions, including limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations.
 Company Facilities. Environmental controls are generally imposed under Irish law through property planning 
legislation, specifically the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts of 1963 to 1999, the Planning and 
Development Act 2000 and regulations made there under. At Dublin Airport, Ryanair operates on land controlled by 
the DAA. Planning permission for its facilities has been granted in accordance with both the zoning and planning 
requirements of Dublin Airport. There is also specific Irish environmental legislation implementing applicable EU 
directives and regulations, to which Ryanair adheres. From time to time, noxious or potentially toxic substances are

held on a temporary basis within Ryanair's engineering facilities at Dublin Airport, Glasgow (Prestwick), London 
(Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn), Stockholm (Skavsta), Oslo (Rygge) and Kaunas. However, at all times Ryanair's 
storage and handling of these substances complies with the relevant regulatory requirements. At Ryanair's 
Glasgow (Prestwick) and London (Stansted) maintenance facilities, all normal waste is removed in accordance with 
the Environmental Protection Act of 1996 and Duty of Care Waste Regulations. For special waste removal, Ryanair 
operates under the Special Waste Regulations 1998. At all other facilities Ryanair adheres to all local and EU 
regulations.
 Ryanair's Policy on Noise and Emissions. Ryanair is committed to reducing emissions and noise through 
investments in "next generation" aircraft and engine technologies and the implementation of certain operational and 
commercial decisions to minimize the environmental impact of its operations. According to the Air Travel Carbon 
and Energy Efficiency Report published by Brighter Planet, Ryanair is the industry leader in terms of environmental 
efficiency, and the Company is constantly working towards improving its performance.

 1              Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the 2013 
fiscal year are set out below. These have been applied consistently for all periods presented, except as 
otherwise stated.
 Business activity
 Ryanair Limited and its subsidiaries ("Ryanair Limited") has operated as an international airline since 
commencing operations in 1985. On August 23, 1996, Ryanair Holdings Limited, a newly formed holding 
company, acquired the entire issued share capital of Ryanair Limited. On May 16, 1997, Ryanair Holdings 
Limited re-registered as a public limited company, Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company"). Ryanair Holdings 
plc and its subsidiaries are hereafter together referred to as "Ryanair Holdings plc" (or "we", "our", 
"us", "Ryanair" or the "Company") and currently operate a low-fares airline headquartered in Dublin, 
Ireland. All trading activity continues to be undertaken by the group of companies headed by Ryanair 
Limited.
 Statement of compliance
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -62-
 In accordance with the International Accounting Standards ("IAS") Regulation (EC 1606 (2002)) which 
applies throughout the European Union ("EU"), the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(collectively "IFRS") as adopted by the EU, which are effective for the year ended and as at March 31,

 Depreciation and amortization.Ryanair's depreciation and amortization per passenger increased by 2.0%, while in 
absolute terms these costs increased 6.6% from EUR309.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR329.6 million in the 
2013 fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of 11 owned aircraft to the fleet during the 
2013 fiscal year. See "-Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per passenger increased by 13.2%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 18.3% from EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR1,884.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 18.3% increase reflected a 15% increase 
in average fuel prices paid and the impact of a 3.7% increase in the number of hours flown, which were offset in 
part by a 2.2% decrease in the average sector length. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of 
delivering fuel to the aircraft, aircraft de-icing and EU emissions trading costs. The average fuel price paid by 
Ryanair (calculated by dividing total fuel costs by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 14.4% 
from EUR2.08 per U.S. gallon in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR2.38 per U.S. gallon in the 2013 fiscal year, in each 
case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance, provision for leased aircraft and the overhaul of spare parts, increased 11.0% on 
a per-passenger basis, while in absolute terms these expenses increased by 16.0% from EUR104.0 million in the 
2012 fiscal year to EUR120.7 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms during the fiscal year 
reflected the additional costs arising from increased level of activity and the opening of new bases.
 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR98.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year, an 8.2% increase 
from the EUR90.7 million reported in the 2012 fiscal year, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor financing 
costs and the adverse impact of changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate on new leased aircraft and the handback 
of 4 aircraft due to the maturity of leases.
 Route charges and airport and handling charges. Ryanair's route charges per passenger increased 1.1% in the 
2013 fiscal year, while airport and handling charges per passenger increased 5.6%. In absolute terms, route 
charges increased 5.7%, from EUR460.5 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR486.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
primarily as a result of the 4.7% increase in sectors flown. In absolute terms, airport and handling charges 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -37-
increased 10.4%, from EUR554.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, to EUR611.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
reflecting the overall growth in passenger volumes and higher charges at Dublin and London (Stansted) airports, 
partially offset by lower average costs at Ryanair's newer airports and bases.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, increased 5.2% on a per-passenger basis in the 
2013 fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 9.9%, from EUR180.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year 
to EUR197.9 million in the 2013 fiscal year, with the overall increase primarily reflecting the higher level of activity 
and increased onboard product costs reflecting the higher level of sales.
 Operating profit.  As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit increased 0.6% on a per-passenger 
basis in the 2013 fiscal year, and also increased in absolute terms, from EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 
EUR718.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income decreased 38.2%, from EUR44.3 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR27.4 million in the 2013 fiscal year, reflecting the reduced yields on term deposits.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges decreased 9.0%, from EUR109.2 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR99.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest rates in the 2013 fiscal year 
compared to the 2012 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase as Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses.Ryanair recorded foreign exchange gains of EUR4.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
as compared with foreign exchange gains of EUR4.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the different result being 
primarily due to the positive impact of changes in the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar exchange rates 
against the euro.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2013 fiscal year was 12.5%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 11.5% 
in the 2012 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR81.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR72.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the increase primarily reflecting higher pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.
 FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011
 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR560.4 million in the 2012 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR374.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year. This profit was primarily 
attributable to an increase in revenues driven by a 15.6% increase in average fares and a 10.6% increase in 
ancillary revenues, partially offset by a 29.9% increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR1,227.0 million to EUR1,593.6 
million.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues increased 23.9%, from EUR2,827.9 million in the 
2011 fiscal year, to EUR3,504.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, primarily reflecting an increase of 15.6% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 5.2%, from 72.1 million to 75.8 million, reflecting increased 
passenger volumes on existing routes and the successful launch of new bases at Manchester, Wroclaw, Baden-
Baden, Billund, Palma, Paphos and Budapest in the 2012 fiscal year. There was a one percentage point decrease 
in booked passenger load factors from 83% in fiscal 2011 to 82% in fiscal 2012.
 Passenger capacity during the 2012 fiscal year increased by 12.3% due to the addition of 22 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft (net of handbacks), as well as a 5.8% increase in sectors flown and a 6.1% increase in the average length 
of passenger haul. Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 79.8% of Ryanair's total revenues for the 2012 
fiscal year, compared with 77.9% of total revenues in the 2011 fiscal year.
 During fiscal year 2012, changes in estimates relating to the timing of revenue recognition for unused passenger 
tickets were made, resulting in increased revenue in the 2012 fiscal year of EUR65.3 million.  This change reflects 
more accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.
 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 10.6%, from EUR801.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 
EUR886.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR11.69 
from EUR11.12. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage 
charges, debit and credit card transactions, sales of rail and bus tickets, accommodation, travel insurance and car 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -37-
rental increased 12.4% to EUR645.6 million from EUR574.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight 
sales increased 6.4%, to EUR107.2 million from EUR100.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-
related services, primarily commissions received from products sold on Ryanair.com or linked websites, increased 
5.3%, from EUR126.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR133.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year. The rate of 
increase in revenues from all ancillary revenue categories exceeded the increase in overall passengers booked.
 The following table sets forth the components of ancillary revenues earned by Ryanair and each component 
expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report
Chairman's Report
 Dear Shareholders,
 I am pleased to report a 13% increase in profit after tax to a new record of EUR569m.  This was an 
excellent result despite a EUR292m increase in fuel costs which we managed to offset by a 6% rise in 
average fares and strong growth in ancillary revenues.
 During the year Ryanair delivered a number of significant milestones:
 --      We grew our traffic by 5% to 79.3m passengers.
 --      We took delivery of 15 new aircraft for a year-end fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800's.
 --      We opened 7 new bases and 217 new routes bringing our route/network operated to over 1,600.
 --      We improved our industry leading passenger service with better punctuality, fewer lost bags and 
less cancellations.
 --      We completed a share buyback of EUR67m in April 2012, and paid a special dividend of EUR492m in 
November, 2012.
 Fuel costs in fiscal 2013 as a proportion of our total operating costs have risen to 45%.  We are 90% 
hedged for fiscal 2014, at approximately US$98 per barrel which is almost another EUR200m  increase in our 
fuel bill.  Oil price rises and high winter charges at certain airports will make it commercially sound to 
ground up to 60 aircraft next winter (80 aircraft last year) rather than incur losses operating these 
aircraft at lower winter yields.  Nevertheless, we still expect passenger volumes in fiscal 2014 to grow 
by approximately 3% to 82m passengers.
 At a recent June 2013 EGM shareholders approved our new 175 aircraft order with Boeing.  Net of 
disposals/lease returns this will enable Ryanair's fleet to increase to 410 aircraft and our traffic to 
grow by 39% to 110m by fiscal 2019.  We see tremendous opportunity in Europe to increase passenger volumes 
as our competitors merge/consolidate, cut short-haul capacity and in some cases exit the industry.  This 
new Boeing order at prices "not dissimilar" to our previous 2005 order will enable us to grow our business 
while at the same time locking in advantageous long term ownership costs in our fleet.
 We recently announced Ryanair's plans to return a further EUR1bn to shareholders (subject to shareholder 
approval at our AGM in September) via share buybacks and special dividends by the end of fiscal 2015.  The 
combination of a special dividend and buy backs (subject to shareholder approval) and previous 
buybacks/special dividends completed will mean that Ryanair will return EUR2.53bn to shareholders since 
2008 which is unprecedented in the airline industry.
 I would like to take this opportunity to thank Klaus Kirchberger for his contribution and commitment to 
Ryanair as a director over the last eleven years.  Klaus resigned from the board at the end of March 2013 
and we wish him much success in the future.  I would also like to warmly welcome three new directors 
Louise Phelan, Julie O'Neill and Dick Milliken. Louise and Julie joined the board in December 2012 while 
Dick joined in July 2013. They will all stand for election at the AGM in September, 2013.
 We look forward to growing Ryanair to 110m passengers and 410 aircraft by fiscal 2019.  The outstanding 
people at Ryanair continue to work hard on behalf of shareholders to reduce our costs while at the same 
time delivering the lowest fares in Europe for the benefit of our 82m passengers.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman
 Chairman
 Chief Executive's Report
 Dear Shareholders,
 Our results emphasise the enduring strength of Ryanair's unique ultra-low cost carrier model (ULCC) in 
Europe. Ryanair delivered a 13% increase in profits to a record EUR569m.  Our traffic grew 5% to 79.3m, as 
load factor remained stable at 82% and average fare (which includes optional checked in bag fees) improved 
by 6% to over EUR48.  Turnover rose 13% to EUR4,884m as ancillary revenues grew by 20% to EUR1,064m.
 Operating costs rose 12% to EUR4,166m mainly due to a EUR292m (18%) increase in our fuel bill to 
EUR1,886m and excessive unjustified price increases at Spanish Airports, where the Government owned AENA 
monopoly continues to raise airport fees while presiding over record traffic declines.  Over the past 5 
years, despite wasting millions on new - and unnecessary - terminals, AENA's traffic has declined from 
210m in 2007 to less than 180m currently.  Ryanair has made offers to AENA to reverse these declines and 
create thousands of jobs in Spanish tourism, but to date these offers have not been accepted.

Body
 Ryanair is subject to Irish and EU regulation, which is implemented primarily by the Department of Transport, the 
IAA, the European Commission, and the EASA. Management believes that the present regulatory environment in 
Ireland and the EU is characterized by high sensitivity to safety and security issues, which is demonstrated by 
intensive reviews of safety-related procedures, training, and equipment by the national and EU regulatory 
authorities.
 Commission for Aviation Regulation. The CAR is currently primarily responsible for deciding maximum airport 
charges only at Dublin Airport. See "3/4Airport Operations3/4Airport Charges" above.
 The CAR also has responsibility for licensing Irish airlines, subject to the requirements of EU law. It issues 
operating licenses under the provisions of EU Regulation 1008/2008 (formerly 2407/92). An operating license is an 
authorization permitting the holder to transport passengers, mail and/or cargo by air. The criteria for granting an 
operating license include, inter alia, an air carrier's financial fitness, the adequacy of its insurance, and the fitness of 
the persons who will manage the air carrier. In addition, in order to obtain and maintain an operating license, Irish 
and EU regulations require that (i) the air carrier must be owned and continue to be owned directly or through 
majority ownership by EU member states and/or nationals of EU member states and (ii) the air carrier must at all 
times be effectively controlled by such EU member states or EU nationals. The CAR has broad authority to revoke 
an operating license. See "Item 10. Additional Information--Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals." 
See also "Item 3. Risk Factors--Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary Shares or ADRs-EU Rules 
Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals and the 
Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 The CAR is also responsible for deciding whether a regulated airport should be coordinated or fully coordinated 
under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 95/93 (as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 793/2004) on slots and for 
authorizing ground handling operations under Council Directive 96/67/EC and its implementing legislation. In April 
2005, the CAR announced that Dublin Airport would be fully slot-coordinated beginning in March 2006. Ryanair 
successfully challenged this decision in the Irish High Court, and the decision was overturned in July 2006. In 
February 2007, the CAR re-imposed full coordination at Dublin Airport. Ryanair again challenged this decision in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -30-
Irish High Court, but subsequently withdrew the challenge. See "-Slots" below for additional information regarding 
this litigation.
 Ryanair's current operating license became effective on December 1, 1993, and is subject to periodic review. The 
Flight Operations Department is also subject to ongoing review by the Irish Aviation Authority (the IAA), which 
reviews the department's audits, including flight audits, training audits, document audits, and quality audits. 
Ryanair's current Air Operator Certificate No IE 7/94 was issued on January 24, 2013.
 Irish Aviation Authority. The IAA is primarily responsible for the operational and regulatory function and services 
relating to the safety and technical aspects of aviation in Ireland. To operate in Ireland and the EU, an Irish air 
carrier is required to hold an operator's certificate granted by the IAA attesting to the air carrier's operational and 
technical competence to conduct airline services with specified types of aircraft. The IAA has broad authority to 
amend or revoke an operator's certificate, with Ryanair's ability to continue to hold its operator's certificate being 
subject to ongoing compliance with applicable statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to the airline industry, 
including any new rules and regulations that may be adopted in the future.
 The IAA is also responsible for overseeing and regulating the operations of Irish air carriers. Matters within the 
scope of the IAA's regulatory authority include: air safety; aircraft certification; personnel licensing and training; 
maintenance, manufacture, repair, airworthiness, and operation of aircraft; implementation of EU legislation; aircraft 
noise; and ground services. Each of the Company's aircraft is required to have a Certificate of Airworthiness, which 
is issued by the IAA. The validity of Certificates of Airworthiness is subject to the review by the IAA. Each certificate 
is generally valid for a 12-month period. In March 2009, Ryanair received "Sub-Part (I) approval" from the IAA, 
which gives Ryanair the authority to extend the validity of its certificates, subject to certain record checks and 
physical aircraft inspections being performed by Ryanair's quality department. The Company's flight personnel, 
flight and emergency procedures, aircraft, and maintenance facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the IAA. 
The IAA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the authority to require reports; inspect the books, 
records, premises, and aircraft of a carrier; and investigate and institute enforcement proceedings. Failure to 
comply with IAA regulations can result in revocation of operating certification.
 In July 1999, the IAA awarded Ryanair an air operator's certificate, which is subject to routine audit and review, in 
recognition of Ryanair's satisfaction of the relevant EU requirements for the operation of commercial air transport 
("EU OPS 1"). The requirements of EU OPS 1 have been incorporated into European law as prescribed in 
Regulation (EEC) 3922/91 and were applied in full on July 16, 2008. All current regulatory requirements are 
addressed in the Ryanair Operations Manual Part A (as amended). The current Manual, Issue 3 Revision 8, was 
approved by the IAA on May 1, 2012.
 Department of Transport. The Department of Transport ("DOT") is responsible for implementation of certain EU 
and Irish legislation and international standards relating to air transport (e.g., noise levels, aviation security, etc.).
 In June 2005, the Irish Minister for Transport enacted legislation strengthening rights for air passengers following 
the enactment of EU legislation requiring compensation of airline passengers who have been denied boarding on a 
flight for which they hold a valid ticket (Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004), which came into force on February 17, 2005. 
See "Item 3. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Airline Industry-EU Regulation on Passenger Compensation Could 
Significantly Increase Related Costs."
 The European Aviation Safety Agency. EASA is an agency of the EU that has been given specific regulatory and 
executive tasks in the field of aviation safety. EASA was established through Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 of the 
European Parliament and the Council of July 15, 2002, repealed by Basic Regulation (EC) 216-2008. The purpose 
of EASA is to draw-up common standards to ensure the highest levels of safety, oversee their uniform application 
across Europe and promote them at the global level. The EASA formally started its work on September 28, 2003, 
taking over the responsibility for regulating airworthiness and maintenance issues within the EU member states.
 Eurocontrol. The European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation ("Eurocontrol") is an autonomous 
European organization established under the Eurocontrol Convention of December 13, 1960. Eurocontrol is 
responsible for, inter alia, the safety of air navigation and the collection of route charges for en route air navigation 
facilities and services throughout Europe. Ireland is a party to several international agreements concerning 
Eurocontrol. These agreements have been implemented in Irish law, which provides for the payment of charges to 
Eurocontrol in respect of air navigation services for aircraft in airspace under the control of Eurocontrol. The 
relevant legislation imposes liability for the payment of any charges upon the operators of the aircraft in respect of 
which services are provided and upon the owners of such aircraft or the managers of airports used by such aircraft. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -30-
Ryanair, as an aircraft operator, is primarily responsible for the payment to Eurocontrol of charges incurred in 
relation to its aircraft.
 The legislation authorizes the detention of aircraft in the case of default in the payment of any charge for air 
navigation services by the aircraft operator or the aircraft owner, as the case may be. This power of detention 
extends to any equipment, stores or documents, which may be onboard the aircraft when it is detained, and may 
result in the possible sale of the aircraft.
 European Commission. The European Commission is in the process of introducing a "single European sky policy," 
which would lead to changes to air traffic management and control within the EU. The "single European sky policy" 
currently consists of the Framework Regulation (Reg. (EC) No. 549/2004) plus three technical regulations on the 
provision of air navigation services, organization and use of the airspace and the interoperability of the European air 
traffic management network. These regulations have recently been amended by the so-called "Single European 
Sky II" regulation (EU Regulation 1070/09). The objective of the policy is to enhance safety standards and the 
overall efficiency of air traffic in Europe, as well as to reduce the cost of air traffic control services.

Body
 Change in EU Regulations in Relation to Employers and Employee Social Insurance Could Increase Costs. The 
European Parliament passed legislation governing the payment of employee and employer social insurance costs 
in May 2012. The legislation was introduced in late June 2012. The legislation governs the country in which 
employees and employers must pay social insurance costs. Prior to June 2012, Ryanair paid employee and 
employer social insurance in the country under whose laws the employee's contract of employment is governed, 
which is either the UK or Ireland. Under the terms of this new legislation, employees and employers must pay social 
insurance in the country where the employee is based. The legislation includes grandfathering rights which means 
that existing employees (i.e. those employed prior to the introduction of the new legislation in June 2012) should be 
exempt. However, both new and existing employees who transfer from their present base location to a new base in 
another EU country may be impacted by the new rules in relation to employee and employer contributions. Each 
country within the EU has different rules and rates in relation to the calculation of employee and employer social 
insurance contributions. Ryanair estimates that the change in legislation will not have any initial material impact on 
its salary costs although it could have an adverse impact over time.
 Ryanair is Subject to Tax Audits. The Company operates in many jurisdictions and is, from time to time, subject to 
tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude. While the Company 
endeavors to be tax compliant in the various jurisdictions in which it operates, there can be no guarantee, 
particularly in the current economic environment, that it will not receive tax assessments following the conclusion of 
the tax audits.  If assessed, the Company will robustly defend its position.  In the event that the Company is 
unsuccessful in defending its position, it is possible that the effective tax rate, employment and other costs of the 
Group could materially increase. See "-The Irish Corporation Tax Rate Could Rise" above.
 Risks Related to the Airline Industry
 The Airline Industry Is Particularly Sensitive to Changes in Economic Conditions: A Continued Recessionary 
Environment Would Negatively Impact Ryanair's Result of Operations. Ryanair's operations and the airline industry 
in general are sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions such as government 
austerity measures, the breakup of the Eurozone, high unemployment rates, constrained credit markets and 
increased business operating costs could lead to reduced spending by both leisure and business passengers. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -20-
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as the conditions persisting as of the date hereof, also tend to impact 
Ryanair's ability to raise fares to counteract increased fuel and other operating costs. A continued recessionary 
environment, combined with austerity measures by European governments, will likely negatively impact Ryanair's 
operating results. It could also restrict the Company's ability to grow passenger volumes, secure new airports and 
launch new routes and bases, and could have a material adverse impact on its financial results.
 The Introduction of Government Taxes on Travel Could Damage Ryanair's Ability to Grow and Could Have a 
Material Adverse Impact on Operations. The U.K. government levies an Air Passenger Duty (APD) of GBP13 per 
passenger. The tax was previously set at GBP5 per passenger, but it was increased to GBP10 per passenger in 
2007, GBP11in 2009, GBP12 in 2010 and subsequently to GBP13 in April 2012.  The increase in this tax is thought 
to have had a negative impact on Ryanair's operating performance, both in terms of average fares paid and growth 
in passenger volumes. In 2008, the Dutch government introduced a travel tax ranging from EUR11 on short-haul 
flights to EUR45 on long-haul flights (withdrawn with effect from July 1, 2009). On March 30, 2009, the Irish 
government also introduced a EUR10 Air Travel Tax on all passengers departing from Irish airports on routes 
longer than 300 kilometers but subsequently reduced it to EUR3 on March 30, 2011. In Germany, the government 
introduced an air passenger tax of EUR8 in January 2011 which was subsequently reduced to EUR7.50 in January 
2012. In Austria, the government also introduced an ecological air travel levy of EUR8 in January 2011.
 Other governments also have introduced or may introduce similar taxes. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Airport Operations-Airport Charges. "The introduction of government taxes on travel has had a negative impact on 
passenger volumes, particularly given the current period of decreased economic activity. The introduction of further 
government taxes on travel across Europe could have a material negative impact on Ryanair's results of operations 
as a result of price-sensitive passengers being less likely to travel.
 EU Regulation on Passenger Compensation Could Significantly Increase Related Costs. The EU has passed 
legislation for compensating airline passengers who have been denied boarding on a flight for which they hold a 
valid ticket (Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004). This legislation, which came into force on February 17, 2005, imposes 
fixed levels of monetary compensation to be paid to passengers in the event of a flight cancellation if the reason for 
the cancellation was within the control of the airline. In November 2009, the Court of Justice of the EU in the 
Sturgeon case decided that provisions of the legislation in relation to compensation are not only applicable to flight 
cancellations but also to delays of over three hours. However, such provisions do not apply to any cancellation, or 
any delay over three hours, in circumstances in which the airline is able to prove that such cancellation or delay was 
caused by extraordinary circumstances, such as weather, air-traffic control delays, or safety issues. The Sturgeon 
case was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling from the High Court of 
Justice (England & Wales), Queen's Bench Division (Administrative Court) on December 24, 2010. The Opinion of 
the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice has reinforced the legitimacy of the Sturgeon judgment. On 
October 23, 2012, the Court of Justice of the European Union affirmed its previous Sturgeon judgment. The 
regulation calls for compensation of EUR250, EUR400 or EUR600 per passenger, depending on the length of the 
flight. As Ryanair's average flight length is less than 1,500 km - the upper limit for short-haul flights - the amount 
payable is generally EUR250 per passenger per occurrence. Passengers subject to long delays (in excess of two 
hours for short-haul flights) are also entitled to "assistance," including meals, drinks and telephone calls, as well as 
hotel accommodation if the delay extends overnight. For delays of over five hours, the airline is also required to 
offer the option of a refund of the cost of the unused ticket. There can be no assurance that the Company will not 
incur a significant increase in costs in the future due to the impact of this legislation if Ryanair experiences a large 
number of cancelled flights, which could occur as a result of certain types of events beyond its control. See "-Risks 
Related to the Airline Industry-Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse 
Effect on the Company's Results of Operations."
 EU Regulation of Emissions Trading Will Increase Costs. On November 19, 2008, the European Council of 
Ministers adopted legislation to add aviation to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") with effect from 2012. 
This scheme, which has thus far applied mainly to industrial companies, is a cap-and-trade system for CO(2) 
emissions to encourage industries to improve their CO(2) efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines are granted initial 
CO(2) allowances based on historical performance and a CO(2) efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of allowances 
will have to be purchased in the open market and/or at government auctions. The cost of such allowances in the 
context of the Company's energy costs are not material at current market prices. There can be no assurance that 
Ryanair will be able to obtain sufficient carbon credits or that the cost of the credits will not have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial condition.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -20-
 Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results 
of Operations. Between April 15 and April 20, 2010 and May 4 and May 17, 2010, a significant portion of the 
airspace over northern Europe was closed by authorities as a result of safety concerns presented by emissions of 
ash from an Icelandic volcano. This closure forced Ryanair to cancel 9,490 flights. In May 2011, there were further 
periodic closures of parts of the European airspace due to emissions of ash from another Icelandic volcano, which 
resulted in the cancellation of 96 flights.
 Under the terms of Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, described above, Ryanair has certain duties to passengers 
whose flights are cancelled. In particular, Ryanair is required to reimburse passengers who have had their flights 
cancelled for certain reasonable, documented expenses - primarily for accommodation and food. The Company to 
date estimates that the non-recoverable fixed costs associated with the cancellations, the repositioning costs for 
aircraft, and other costs associated with cancellations, as well as the aforementioned reimbursement claims for the 
initial 20 days of closure of European aerospace will amount to approximately EUR29 million for such periods of 
closure. The Company has re-accommodated or refunded fares to approximately 1.5 million passengers due to 
flight cancellations.

 In the case of Dublin, the DAA has built a second terminal, costing over four times its initial estimate. When the 
DAA first announced plans to build a second terminal ("Terminal 2") at Dublin Airport, it estimated that the proposed 
expansion would cost between EUR170 million and EUR200 million. Ryanair supported a development of this 
scale; however, in September 2006, the DAA announced that the construction of Terminal 2 would cost 
approximately EUR800 million. Subsequently, the cost of the new infrastructure rose in excess of EUR1.2 billion. 
Ryanair opposed expansion at what it believed to be an excessive cost. 
On August 29, 2007, however the relevant planning authority approved the planning application from the DAA for 
the building of Terminal 2, and other facilities, all of which went ahead. On May 1, 2010, the airport fees per 
departing passenger increased by 27% from EUR13.61 to EUR17.23, and by a further 12% in 2011 following the 
opening of Terminal 2 in November 2010 in accordance with the CAR's decision of December 4, 2009 in relation to 
airport charges between 2010 and 2014. Ryanair sought a judicial review of the planning approval, however, this 
appeal was unsuccessful. The increase in charges, in combination with the introduction of the EUR10 Air Travel 
Tax (subsequently reduced to EUR3) mentioned above, led to substantially reduced passenger volumes to and 
from Dublin Airport.  See "Item 3. Risk Factors3/4Risks Related to the Company3/4Ryanair's Continued Growth is 
Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject to Increase" and "-The Company 
Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports," as well as "Item 4. Information on the 
Company-Airport Operations-Airport Charges."
 Legal Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts. The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings 
against internet ticket touts (screenscraper websites) in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and 
Switzerland. Screenscraper websites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair's website and booking system, extract 
flight and pricing information and display it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which include 
intermediary fees on top of Ryanair's fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and 
objects to the practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights, 
copyright protection, etc. The Company's objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website. The Company 
also believes that the selling of airline tickets by screenscraper websites is inherently anti-consumer as it inflates 
the cost of air travel. At the same time, Ryanair encourages genuine price comparison websites which allow 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -49-
consumers to compare prices of several airlines and then refer consumers to the airline website in order to perform 
the booking at the original fare. Ryanair offers licensed access to its flight and pricing information to such websites. 
The Company has received favorable rulings in Ireland, Germany and The Netherlands, and unfavorable rulings 
primarily in Spain. However, pending the outcome of these legal proceedings and if Ryanair were to be ultimately 
unsuccessful in them, the activities of screenscraper websites could lead to a reduction in the number of customers 
who book directly on Ryanair's website and loss of ancillary revenues which are an important source of profitability 
through the sale of car hire, hotels and travel insurance etc. Also, some customers may be lost to the Company 
once they are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair fare inflated by the screenscraper's 
intermediary fee. See Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Ryanair Faces Risks

 Following shareholder approval at the September 2010 annual general meeting of shareholders, a EUR500 million 
special dividend was paid in October 2010.  Similarly, following shareholder approval at the September 2012 annual 
general meeting of shareholders, a dividend of EUR0.34 per Ordinary Share (approximately EUR492 million) was 
paid in November 2012.  The Company may pay other dividends from time to time. In June 2013, the Company 
detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders over the next two years with at least EUR400.0 million 
(EUR176.6 million already completed in June 2013) in share buybacks to be completed in the fiscal year to March 
31, 2014 and up to a further EUR600.0 million in either special dividends or share buybacks. However, there can be 
no assurance that the EUR1 billion will be returned to shareholders, in whole or in part, as it is subject to 
shareholder approval, continuing profitability, the economic environment, capital expenditure and other 
commitments. Any cash dividends or other distributions, if made, are expected to be made in euro, although 
Ryanair Holdings' Articles provide that dividends may be declared and paid in U.S. dollars. In the case of ADRs, the 
Depositary will convert all cash dividends and other distributions payable to owners of ADRs into U.S. dollars to the 
extent that, in its judgment, it can do so on a reasonable basis, and will distribute the resulting U.S. dollar amounts 
(net of conversion expenses and any applicable fees) to the owners of ADRs. See "Item 12. Description of 
Securities Other than Equity Securities" for information regarding fees of the Depositary.
 Share Buy-back Program
 Following shareholder approval at the 2006 annual general meeting of shareholders, a EUR300 million share buy-
back program was formally announced on June 5, 2007. Permission was received at the annual general meeting of 
the shareholders held on September 20, 2007 to repurchase a maximum of 75.6 million Ordinary Shares 
representing 5% of the Company's then outstanding share capital. The EUR300 million share buy-back of 
approximately 59.5 million Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 3.8% of the Company's pre-existing share 
capital, was completed in November 2007. In February 2008, the Company announced a second share buy-back 
program of up to EUR200 million worth of Ordinary Shares, which was ratified by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting of the shareholders held on September 18, 2008. 18.1 million Ordinary Shares were repurchased 
under this program at a cost of approximately EUR46.0 million. The Company also completed the share buy-back 
of EUR125 million in respect of 36.5 million Ordinary Shares in the 2012 fiscal year.  In April 2012, the Company 
completed a share buy-back of 15 million Ordinary Shares at a cost of approximately EUR68 million. A further 24.1 
million Ordinary Shares (including just over 2.0 million ADRs were repurchased in June 2013 at a cost of 
approximately EUR176.6 million. As a result, the total amount spent on the share buy-back programs to date was 
approximately EUR714.3 million.  All Ordinary Shares (including ADRs which represent five Ordinary Shares) 
repurchased have been cancelled.
 In April 2012, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting to authorize the Directors to repurchase 
Ordinary Shares and ADRs for up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ. Up 
until April 2012, shareholders had only authorized the Directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares. As the ADRs 
typically trade at a premium of up to 20% compared to Ordinary Shares, this may result in increased costs in 
performing share buy-backs in the future. On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1 
billion to shareholders over the next two years with at least EUR400.0 million (EUR176.6 million already completed 
in June 2013) in share buybacks to be completed in the fiscal year to March 31, 2014 and up to a further EUR600.0 
million in either special dividends or share buybacks. However, there can be no assurance that the EUR1 billion will 
be returned to shareholders, in whole or in part, as it is subject to shareholder approval, continuing profitability, the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -49-
economic environment, capital expenditure and other commitments. At this time, the Company has not decided 
whether it will conduct these further share repurchases in Ordinary Shares or ADRs or a combination of both.
 See "Item 9. The Offer and Listing - Trading Markets and Share Prices" below for further information regarding 
share buy-backs.
 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
 On May 27, 2013 the Company issued a Class 1 circular to shareholders seeking their approval for the purchase of 
175 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, with a list value of over US$14.2 billion. An EGM was held June 18, 2013 and 
shareholders approved the transaction.
 In June 2013 the Company bought back 24.1 million ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6 million, for 
cancellation.  Cumulatively these buybacks are equivalent to 1.7% of the issued share capital of the Company.
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders over the next two years 
with at least EUR400.0 million (EUR176.6 million already completed in June 2013) in share buybacks to be 
completed in the fiscal year to March 31, 2014 and up to a further EUR600.0 million in either special dividends or 
share buybacks (subject to shareholder approval).

Operating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses decreased from 86.5% in 
the 2011 fiscal year to 84.5% in the 2012 fiscal year, as total revenues increased by 21.0%, faster than the 18.0% 
increase in operating expenses. In absolute terms, total operating expenses increased 18.0%, from EUR3,141.3 
million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR3,707.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, principally as a result of a 29.9% 
increase in fuel costs from EUR1,227.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year. 
Staff costs, depreciation and amortization, maintenance expenses, aircraft rental expenses, route charges, airport 
handling charges and marketing, distribution and other costs decreased as a percentage of total revenues, while 
fuel and oil increased. Total operating expenses per passenger increased by 12.2%, with the increase reflecting, 
principally, the increase in passenger numbers during the 2012 fiscal year and the impact of the higher fuel costs.
 The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results of the Company for the 
year ended March 31, 2012 and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on future operations. The 
Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company operated the 
grounded aircraft would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these aircraft, due to 
significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any material staff 
costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be furloughed under 
the terms of their contracts without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the grounded aircraft 
will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of depreciation and 
amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.
 The following table sets forth the amounts in euro cent of, and percentage changes in, Ryanair's operating 
expenses per passenger for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 under IFRS. These data 
are calculated by dividing the relevant expense amount (as shown in the consolidated financial statements) by the 
number of ASMs in the relevant year as shown in the table of "Selected Operating and Other Data" in Item 3 and 
rounding to the nearest euro cent; the percentage change is calculated on the basis of the relevant figures before 
rounding.

Staff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, increased 4.9% on a per-
passenger basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 10.3%, from EUR376.1 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year (which included EUR4.6 million in relation to volcanic ash expenses) to EUR415.0 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year. The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a 10.5% increase in hours flown and a Company-
wide pay increase of 2% granted in April 2011, partially offset by a EUR2.5 million reversal of previously recognized 
share-based payment compensation expense for awards that did not vest.
 Depreciation and amortization.Ryanair's depreciation and amortization per passenger increased by 5.8%, while in 
absolute terms these costs increased 11.3% from EUR277.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year, to EUR309.2 million in 
the 2012 fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of 14 owned aircraft to the fleet during 
the 2012 fiscal year. See "-Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per passenger increased by 23.5%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 29.9% from EUR1,227.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 29.9% increase reflected an 18.2% 
increase in average fuel prices paid, the impact of a 10.5% increase in the number of hours flown and a 6.1% 
increase in the average sector length. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of delivering fuel to 
the aircraft, and aircraft de-icing costs. The average fuel price paid by Ryanair (calculated by dividing total fuel costs 
by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 18.2% from EUR1.76 per U.S. gallon in the 2011 fiscal 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -38-
year to EUR2.08 per U.S. gallon in the 2012 fiscal year, in each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel 
hedging activities.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance and the overhaul of spare parts, increased 5.3% on a per-passenger basis, while 
in absolute terms these expenses increased by 10.8% from EUR93.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR104.0 
million in the 2012 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms during the fiscal year reflected the additional costs 
arising from increased level of activity and the opening of new bases.
 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR90.7 million in the 2012 fiscal year, a 6.7% decrease 
from the EUR97.2 million reported in the 2011 fiscal year, reflecting the lower lease costs on newer aircraft and the 
handback of 3 aircraft due to the maturity of leases.
 Route charges and airport and handling charges. Ryanair's route charges per passenger increased 6.6% in the 
2012 fiscal year, while airport and handling charges per passenger increased 7.1%. In absolute terms, route 
charges increased 12.2%, from EUR410.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR460.5 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year, primarily as a result of the 5.8% increase in sectors flown. In absolute terms, airport and handling charges 
increased 12.6%, from EUR491.8 million in the 2011 fiscal year, to EUR554.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, 
reflecting the overall growth in passenger volumes and higher charges at Dublin and Stansted airports, partially 
offset by lower average costs at Ryanair's newer airports and bases.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, increased 2.5% on a per-passenger basis in the 
2012 fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 7.8%, from EUR167.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year 
to EUR180.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the overall increase primarily reflecting the higher level of activity 
and increased onboard product costs reflecting the higher level of sales.

 Aircraft Equipment Costs. Ryanair's primary strategy for controlling aircraft acquisition costs is focused on 
operating a single aircraft type. Ryanair currently operates only "next generation" Boeing 737-800s. Ryanair's 
continuous acquisition of new Boeing 737-800s has already and is expected, through the end of fiscal 2019, to 
increase the size of its fleet and thus increase its aircraft equipment and related costs (on an aggregate basis). 
However, the purchase of aircraft from a single manufacturer enables Ryanair to limit the costs associated with 
personnel training, maintenance, and the purchase and storage of spare parts while also affording the Company 
greater flexibility in the scheduling of crews and equipment. Management also believes that the terms of Ryanair's 
contracts with Boeing are very favorable to Ryanair. See "3/4Aircraft" below for additional information on Ryanair's 
fleet.
 Personnel Costs. Ryanair endeavors to control its labor costs by seeking to continually improve the productivity of 
its already highly productive work force. Compensation for personnel emphasizes productivity-based pay 
incentives. These incentives include commissions for onboard sales of products for flight attendants and payments 
based on the number of hours or sectors flown by pilots and flight attendants within limits set by industry standards 
or regulations fixing maximum working hours.
 Customer Service Costs. Ryanair has entered into agreements on competitive terms with external contractors at 
certain airports for ticketing, passenger and aircraft handling, and other services that management believes can be 
more cost-efficiently provided by third parties. Management attempts to obtain competitive rates for such services 
by negotiating fixed-price, multi-year contracts. The development of its own Internet booking facility has allowed 
Ryanair to eliminate travel agent commissions and third-party reservation systems costs. Ryanair generates over 
99% of its scheduled passenger revenues through direct sales via its website.
 Airport Access and Handling Costs. Ryanair attempts to control airport access and service charges by focusing on 
airports that offer competitive prices. Management believes that Ryanair's record of delivering a consistently high 
volume of passenger traffic growth at many airports has allowed it to negotiate favorable contracts with such 
airports for access to their facilities. Secondary and regional airports also generally do not have slot requirements or 
other operating restrictions that can increase operating expenses and limit the number of allowed take-offs and 
landings. Ryanair further endeavors to reduce its airport charges by opting, when practicable, for less expensive 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -24-
gate locations as well as outdoor boarding stairs, rather than jetways, which are more expensive and operationally 
less efficient to use. In addition, since October 2009, Ryanair has required all passengers to check-in on the 
Internet. This requirement was instituted to reduce waiting times at airports and speed a passenger's journey from 
arrival at the airport to boarding, as well as significantly reduce airport handling costs. Ryanair has also introduced a 
checked-bag fee, which is payable on the Internet at the time of booking and is aimed at reducing the number of 
bags carried by passengers in order to further reduce handling costs. See "Risk Factors-Risks Related to the 
Company-The Company Faces Risks Related to its Internet Reservations Operations and its Announced 
Elimination of Airport Check-in Facilities."
 Taking Advantage of the Internet. In 2000, Ryanair converted its host reservation system to a new system, which it 
operates under a hosting agreement with Navitaire that was extended in 2011 and will terminate in 2020. As part of 
the implementation of the new reservation system, Navitaire developed an Internet booking facility. The Ryanair 
system allows Internet users to access its host reservation system and to make and pay for confirmed reservations 
in real time through the Ryanair.com website. After the launch of the Internet reservation system, Ryanair heavily 
promoted its website through newspaper, radio and television advertising. As a result, Internet bookings grew 
rapidly, and have accounted for over 99% of all reservations over the past several years. In May 2012, Ryanair 
further upgraded the reservation system, which offers more flexibility for future system enhancements and to 
accommodate the future growth of Ryanair.
 Commitment to Safety and Quality Maintenance. Safety is the primary priority of Ryanair and its management. This 
commitment begins with the hiring and training of Ryanair's pilots, flight attendants, and maintenance personnel 
and includes a policy of maintaining its aircraft in accordance with the highest European airline industry standards. 
Ryanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality as a result of an accident with one of its aircraft in its 
29-year operating history. Although Ryanair seeks to maintain its fleet in a cost-effective manner, management 
does not seek to extend Ryanair's low-cost operating strategy to the areas of safety, maintenance, training or 
quality assurance. Routine aircraft maintenance and repair services are performed primarily by Ryanair, at 
Ryanair's main bases, but are also performed at other base airports by maintenance contractors approved under 
the terms of Part 145. Ryanair currently performs heavy airframe maintenance, but contracts with other parties who 
perform engine overhaul services and rotable repairs. These contractors also provide similar services to a number 
of other airlines, including Southwest Airlines, British Airways, Air France and Alitalia.
 Enhancement of Operating Results through Ancillary Services. Ryanair distributes accommodation services and 
travel insurance primarily through its website. For hotel services, Ryanair has a contract with Hotelscombined PTY 
Ltd, and they provide a hotel comparison website to Ryanair which generates commissions for Ryanair on the 
number of bookings made. In addition Ryanair has a contract with the Hertz Corporation ("Hertz"), pursuant to 
which Hertz handles all car rental services marketed through Ryanair's website or telephone reservation system. 
Ryanair also sells bus and rail tickets onboard its aircraft and through its website. For the 2013 fiscal year, ancillary 
services accounted for approximately 22% of Ryanair's total operating revenues, as compared to approximately 
20% of such revenues in the 2012 fiscal year. See "-Ancillary Services" below and "Item 5. Operating and Financial 
Review and Prospects-Results of Operations-Fiscal Year 2013 Compared with Fiscal Year 2012-Ancillary 
Revenues" for additional information.
 Focused Criteria for Growth.Building on its success in the Ireland-U.K. market and its expansion of service to 
continental Europe and Morocco, Ryanair intends to follow a manageable growth plan targeting specific markets. 
Ryanair believes it will have opportunities for continued growth by: (i) initiating additional routes in the EU; (ii) 
initiating additional routes in countries party to a European Common Aviation Agreement with the EU that are 
currently served by higher-cost, higher-fare carriers; (iii) increasing the frequency of service on its existing routes; 
(iv) starting new domestic routes within individual EU countries; (v) considering acquisition opportunities that may 
become available in the future; (vi) connecting airports within its existing route network ("triangulation"); (vii) 
establishing new bases; and (viii) initiating new routes not currently served by any carrier.
 Responding to Current Challenges. In recent periods, and with increased effect in the 2011, 2012 and 2013 fiscal 
years, Ryanair's ultra-low cost, low-fares model has faced substantial pressure due to significantly increased fuel 
costs and reduced economic growth (or economic contraction) in some of the economies in which it operates. The 
Company has aimed to meet these challenges by: (i) grounding (approximately 80 in fiscal 2012 and 2013) aircraft 
during the winter season; (ii) disposing of aircraft (lease hand backs totaled ten in the 2011 fiscal year, three in the 
2012 fiscal year and four in the 2013 fiscal year); (iii) controlling labor and other costs, including through wage 
freezes for non-flight crew personnel in 2011 and 2013, selective redundancies and the introduction of Internet 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -24-
check-in in fiscal 2010; and (iv) renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers, airports and handling companies. 
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving all of the foregoing or taking other 
similar measures, or that doing so will allow the Company to earn profits in any period. See "Item 3. Key 
Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the 
Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse Impact to the Company's Profitability" and "-The 
Company May Not Be Successful in Increasing Fares and Revenues to Offset Higher Business Costs."
 In recent years, in response to an operating environment characterized by high fuel prices, typically lower seasonal 
yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, Ryanair has adopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its 
fleet during the winter months (from November to March inclusive). In the winter months of fiscal year 2013, Ryanair 
grounded approximately 80 aircraft and the Company announced in May 2013 that it intends to ground 
approximately 60 aircraft during the winter months of fiscal year 2014. While seasonal grounding does reduce the 
Company's operating costs, it also decreases Ryanair's potential to record both flight and non-flight revenues. 
Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may also negatively affect the Company's labor relations, including 
its ability to attract flight personnel interested in full-time employment. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-
Ryanair Has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft."

 For additional details on the Boeing contracts, scheduled aircraft deliveries and related expenditures and their 
financing, as well as the terms of the arrangements under which Ryanair currently leases 57 of the aircraft in its 
operating fleet, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 The Boeing 737 is the world's most widely used commercial aircraft and exists in a number of generations, the 
Boeing 737-800s being the most recent. Management believes that spare parts and cockpit crews qualified to fly 
these aircraft are likely to be more widely available on favorable terms than similar resources for other types of 
aircraft. Management believes that its strategy, to date, of having reduced its fleet to one aircraft type enables 
Ryanair to limit the costs associated with personnel training, the purchase and storage of spare parts, and 
maintenance. Furthermore, this strategy affords Ryanair greater flexibility in the scheduling of crews and 
equipment. The Boeing 737-800s are fitted with CFM 56-7B engines and have advanced CAT III Autoland 
capability, advanced traffic collision avoidance systems, and enhanced ground-proximity warning systems. During 
fiscal 2012, Boeing announced that it was going to manufacture a variant of the 737 with new, more fuel-efficient 
engines called the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. A senior Ryanair working group is continuing to evaluate the benefits 
of the MAX aircraft. This new variant could impact the Company insofar as the residual value of its aircraft could be 
reduced when this new variant enters production, currently expected to be in late 2017.
 At March 31, 2013, the average aircraft age of the Company's Boeing 737-800 fleet was just over 4.5 years.
 Training and Regulatory Compliance
 Ryanair currently owns and operates four Boeing 737-800 full flight simulators for pilot training, the first of which 
was delivered in 2002. The simulators were purchased from CAE Electronics Ltd. of Quebec, Canada ("CAE"). The 
second simulator was delivered in 2004, while the third and fourth simulators were delivered in the 2008 fiscal year. 
In September 2006, Ryanair entered into a new contract with CAE to purchase B737NG Level B flight simulators. 
Two such simulators were delivered in the 2009 fiscal year.
 Management believes that Ryanair is currently in compliance with all applicable regulations and EU directives 
concerning its fleet of Boeing 737-800 aircraft and will comply with any regulations or EU directives that may come 
into effect in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA or other regulatory authorities will not 
recommend or require other safety-related undertakings that could adversely impact the Company's results of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -26-
operations or financial condition. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Safety-Related Undertakings Could 
Affect the Company's Results."
 ANCILLARY SERVICES
 Ryanair provides various ancillary services and engages in other activities connected with its core air passenger 
service, including non-flight scheduled services, Internet-related services, and the in-flight sale of beverages, food, 
and merchandise. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Results of Operations-Fiscal Year 
2013 Compared with Fiscal Year 2012-Ancillary Revenues" for additional information.
 As part of its non-flight scheduled and Internet-related services, Ryanair incentivizes ground service providers at 
many of the airports it serves to levy correct excess baggage charges for any baggage that exceeds Ryanair's 
published baggage allowances and to collect these charges in accordance with Ryanair's standard terms and 
conditions. Excess baggage charges are recorded as non-flight scheduled revenue.
 Ryanair primarily distributes accommodation services and travel insurance through its website. For hotel and 
accommodation services, Ryanair has a contract with Hotelscombined PTY Ltd. ("Hotelscombined"), which 
operates a price comparison website, pursuant to which Hotelscombined handles all aspects of such services 
marketed through Ryanair's website and pays a fee to Ryanair. In addition, Ryanair has a contract with Hertz, 
pursuant to which Hertz handles all car rental services marketed through Ryanair's website or telephone 
reservation system.
 Ryanair also sells bus and rail tickets onboard its aircraft and through its website. Ryanair also sells car parking, 
attractions and activities on its website, with the latter having gone on sale in-flight in spring 2012.
 Ryanair sells mobile phone credit for smart phone devices on its website, introduced in December 2012. Ryanair 
also sells gift vouchers on its website. Such gift vouchers are redeemable online. In May 2009, Ryanair started to 
offer its passengers the possibility of receiving an SMS (text message) when booking, at a fee of GBP1.50 or 
EUR1.50, to inform them of their flight confirmation details.
 In April 2009, Ryanair signed a contract with Webloyalty International Ltd, which offers Ryanair's customers who 
have a UK, German or French billing address a retail discount and cash-back program. In February 2009, Ryanair 
introduced Google Adsense to its search results pages in order to monetize the traffic levels that those pages 
generate. In March 2009, Ryanair expanded further into the area of third-party Internet advertising with the 
introduction of third-party display advertising on the homepages on its website and, more recently, on the subpages 
of Ryanair.com. In April 2011, Ryanair began to sell advertising on its boarding cards. In 2012, a boarding card 
redesign along with increased passenger volumes allowed for further growth in this area.
 Ryanair has entered into agreements pursuant to which the Company promotes Ryanair-branded credit and 
prepaid cards issued by Deutsche Bank, GE Money, Access Prepaid (a Mastercard company) and Banco 
Santander on its Internet site. The Deutsche Bank agreement relates to Italian residents only, the GE Money 
agreement relates to Swedish and Polish residents only and the Banco Santander agreement relates to UK 
residents only. Ryanair generates revenue from Deutsche Bank, GE Capital and Banco Santander on the basis of 
the number of cards issued and the revenues generated through the use of the credit cards. The Access Prepaid 
Limited prepaid card covers residents in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Germany.
 In fiscal year 2012, Ryanair rolled out handheld Electronic Point of Sale ("EPOS") devices across its route network. 
These EPOS devices replaced manual and paper based systems on board the aircraft. The EPOS device enables 
cabin crew to sell and record their on-board sales transactions more efficiently and generate vastly improved 
management sales reporting. The EPOS device also issues bus and rail tickets and tickets for tourist attractions.
 In fiscal year 2011, Ryanair began offering reserved seating in twenty-one extra legroom seats on each aircraft for 
a fee on certain routes and this feature was rolled out to all routes in fiscal year 2012. There are currently 45 
reserved seats available for purchase on each flight.
 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS
 General
 As part of its commitment to safety, Ryanair endeavors to hire qualified maintenance personnel, provide proper 
training to such personnel, and maintain its aircraft in accordance with European industry standards. While Ryanair 
seeks to maintain its fleet in a cost-effective manner, management does not seek to extend Ryanair's low-cost 
operating strategy to the areas of maintenance, training or quality control.
 Ryanair's quality assurance department deals with oversight of all maintenance activities in accordance with Part 
145. The European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"), which established Part 145, came into being on September 
28, 2003; through the adoption of Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 of the European Parliament, and its standards 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -26-
superseded 
the 
previous 
Joint 
Aviation 
Authority 
("JAA") 
requirements. 
See 
"3/4Government 
Regulation3/4Regulatory Authorities."
 Ryanair is itself an EASA Part 145-approved maintenance contractor and provides its own routine aircraft 
maintenance and repair services. Ryanair also performs certain checks on its aircraft, including pre-flight, daily, and 
transit checks at some of its bases, as well as A-checks at its Dublin, London (Stansted), Glasgow (Prestwick), 
Bremen and Frankfurt (Hahn) facilities. Since December 2003, Ryanair has operated a hangar facility at its base at 
Glasgow (Prestwick) in Scotland, where both A-checks and C-checks are performed on the fleet of Boeing 737-800 
aircraft. The facility performs up to four C-checks per week and Ryanair has recently opened a new C-check hangar 
facility in Kaunas, Lithuania where it carries out between one and two light C-checks per week, enabling Ryanair to 
perform all of the heavy maintenance that is currently required on its Boeing 737-800 fleet in-house.
 Ryanair opened a five-bay hangar and stores facility at its London (Stansted) airport base in October 2008 to allow 
Ryanair to carry out additional line maintenance on its expanding fleet. This facility also incorporates two flight 
simulator devices with space and provisions for two more, together with a cabin crew trainer and associated training 
rooms. Ryanair has completed the building of a separate training facility adjacent to the hangar to accommodate a 
full size 737NG training aircraft to allow for cabin crew and engineering training. Ryanair carries out A-checks and 
line maintenance in its single-bay aircraft hangar facility in Bremen. Ryanair has also entered into a 30-year sole-
tenancy agreement with Frankfurt (Hahn) airport and has taken acceptance of a two-bay hangar and stores facility 
that also incorporates a two-bay simulator-training center. This facility was completed in January 2011 and allows 
Ryanair to carry out additional line maintenance including A-checks.

  on the Company-Government Regulation-Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market."
 The airline industry is highly susceptible to price discounting, in part because airlines incur very low marginal costs 
for providing service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Both low-fare and traditional airlines 
sometimes offer low fares in direct competition with Ryanair across a significant proportion of its route network as a 
result of the liberalization of the EU air transport market and greater public acceptance of the low-fares model. 
Although Ryanair's average booked passenger fare increased in the 2011, 2012 and 2013 fiscal years, it decreased 
in the 2010 fiscal year, and there can be no assurance that it will not decrease in future periods.
 Although Ryanair intends to compete vigorously and to assert its rights against any predatory pricing or other 
similar conduct, price competition among airlines could reduce the level of fares and/or passenger traffic on 
Ryanair's routes to the point where profitability may not be achievable.
 In addition to traditional competition among airline companies and charter operators who have entered the low-
fares market, the industry also faces competition from ground transportation (including high-speed rail systems) and 
sea transportation alternatives, as businesses and recreational travellers seek substitutes for air travel.
 The Company Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and Capital 
Markets Could Negatively Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain Financing on Acceptable Terms.Ryanair's continued 
growth is dependent upon its ability to acquire additional aircraft to meet additional capacity needs and to replace 
older aircraft. Ryanair had 305 aircraft in its fleet by March 31, 2013 and has ordered an additional 175 new Boeing 
737-800 next generation aircraft (the "New Aircraft") for delivery during fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2019 pursuant to a 
contract with the Boeing Company (the "2013 Boeing Contract").  Ryanair expects to have approximately 410 
aircraft in its fleet by March 31, 2019, depending on the level of lease returns/disposals. For additional information 
on the Company's aircraft fleet and expansion plans, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Aircraft" and "Item 
5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects3/4Liquidity and Capital Resources." There can be no assurance 
that this planned expansion will not outpace the growth of passenger traffic on Ryanair's routes or that traffic growth 
will not prove to be greater than the expanded fleet can accommodate. In either case, such developments could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -17-
 As a result of the 2013 Boeing Contract, the Company is expected to raise substantial debt financing to deliver all 
of the expected aircraft deliveries over the period from September 2014 to December 2018. This aircraft order is 
expected to increase the Company's outstanding debt from 2016 onwards.  Furthermore, Ryanair's ability to draw 
down funds under its existing bank-loan facilities to pay for aircraft as they are delivered is subject to various 
conditions imposed by the counterparties to such bank loan facilities and related loan guarantees, and any future 
financing is expected to be subject to similar conditions.  Any failure by Ryanair to comply with such conditions 
would have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial condition.
 Using the debt capital markets to finance the 2013 Boeing Contract may require the Company to obtain a credit 
rating or potentially to obtain a credit rating for specific debt transactions, for example using an Enhanced 
Equipment Trust Certificate ("EETC"), a structured product that is widely used in the U.S. to finance aircraft 
deliveries. The requirement for a credit rating depends, amongst other things, on whether Ryanair finances via 
secured funding or through general corporate purposes. Other financing structures such as U.S. Ex-im Bank loan 
guarantees and capital markets financing, sale and operating leaseback financing and Japanese operating leases 
with call options ("JOLCOs") will not require the Company to obtain a credit rating and these sources are widely 
used in the aviation industry.
 Ryanair has also entered into significant derivative transactions intended to hedge its current aircraft acquisition-
related debt obligations. These derivative transactions expose Ryanair to certain risks and could have adverse 
effects on its results of operations and financial condition. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk."
 The Company's Growth May Expose It to Risks. Ryanair's operations have grown rapidly since it pioneered the 
low-fares operating model in Europe in the early 1990s.  Ryanair intends to continue to expand its fleet and add 
new destinations and additional flights, with the goal of increasing Ryanair's booked passenger volumes to 
approximately 110 million passengers per annum by March 31, 2019, an increase of 39% from the approximately 
79 million passengers booked in the 2013 fiscal year. However, no assurance can be given that this target will in 
fact be met. If growth in passenger traffic and Ryanair's revenues do not keep pace with the planned expansion of 
its fleet, Ryanair could suffer from overcapacity and its results of operations and financial condition (including its 
ability to fund scheduled purchases of the New Aircraft and related debt) could be materially adversely affected.
 The continued expansion of Ryanair's fleet and operations, although somewhat lower in percentage terms than in 
previous years, in addition to other factors, may also strain existing management resources and related operational, 
financial, management information and information technology systems. Expansion will generally require additional 
skilled personnel, equipment, facilities and systems. An inability to hire skilled personnel or to secure required 
equipment and facilities efficiently and in a cost-effective manner may adversely affect Ryanair's ability to achieve 
its growth plans and sustain or increase its profitability.
 Ryanair's New Routes and Expanded Operations May Have an Adverse Financial Impact on its Results. Currently, 
a substantial number of carriers operate routes that compete with Ryanair, and the Company expects to face further 
intense competition.
 When Ryanair commences new routes, its load factors and fares tend to be lower than those on its established 
routes and its advertising and other promotional costs tend to be higher, which may result in initial losses that could 
have a material negative impact on Ryanair's results of operations as well as require a substantial amount of cash 
to fund. In addition, there can be no assurance that Ryanair's low-fares service will be accepted on new routes. 
Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the opening of 
new routes. Promotional fares may have the effect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair's yield and 
passenger revenues on such routes during the periods that they are in effect. Ryanair has other significant cash 
needs as it expands, including as regards the cash required to fund aircraft purchases or aircraft deposits related to 
the acquisition of additional Boeing 737-800 series aircraft. There can be no assurance that Ryanair will have 
sufficient cash to make such expenditures and investments, and to the extent Ryanair is unable to expand its route 
system successfully, its future revenue and earnings growth will in turn be limited. Further volcanic ash emissions, 
similar to those experienced in April and May 2010, could make consumers less willing and/or able to travel and 
impact the launch of new routes or bases. See "-Risks Related to the Airline Industry-Volcanic Ash Emissions 
Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results of Operations." See also 
"-The Company Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and Capital 
Markets Could Negatively Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain Financing on Acceptable Terms."
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -17-
 Ryanair's Continued Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject 
to Increase. Airline traffic at certain European airports is regulated by a system of grandfathered "slot" allocations. 
Each slot represents authorization to take-off and land at the particular airport during a specified time period. 
Although the majority of Ryanair's bases currently have no slot allocations, traffic at a minority of the airports 
Ryanair serves, including its primary bases, is currently regulated through slot allocations. There can be no 
assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a sufficient number of slots at slot-controlled airports that it may wish 
to serve in the future, at the time it needs them, or on acceptable terms. There can also be no assurance that its 
non-slot constrained bases, or the other non-slot constrained airports Ryanair serves, will continue to operate 
without slot allocation restrictions in the future. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Government Regulation-
Slots." Airports may impose other operating restrictions such as curfews, limits on aircraft noise levels, mandatory 
flight paths, runway restrictions, and limits on the number of average daily departures. Such restrictions may limit 
the ability of Ryanair to provide service to, or increase service at, such airports.

 ==========  ==========  =========
* Decrease on prior year due to lower aircraft in operation in March 2012 and cabin crew staff being furloughed.
 Ryanair's pilots, flight attendants and maintenance and ground operations personnel undergo training, both initial 
and recurrent. A substantial portion of the initial training for Ryanair's flight attendants is devoted to safety 
procedures, and cabin crew are required to undergo annual evacuation and fire drill training during their tenure with 
the airline. Ryanair also provides salary increases to its engineers who complete advanced training in certain fields 
of aircraft maintenance. Ryanair utilizes its own Boeing 737-800 aircraft simulators for pilot training.
 IAA regulations require pilots to be licensed as commercial pilots with specific ratings for each aircraft to be flown. 
In addition, IAA regulations require all commercial pilots to be medically certified as physically fit. At March 31, 
2013, the average age of Ryanair's pilots was 35 years and their average period of employment with Ryanair was 
4.8 years. Licenses and medical certification are subject to periodic re-evaluation and require recurrent training and 
recent flying experience in order to be maintained. Maintenance engineers must be licensed and qualified for 
specific aircraft types. Flight attendants must undergo initial and periodic competency training. Training programs 
are subject to approval and monitoring by the IAA. In addition, the appointment of senior management personnel 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -45-
directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance and aircraft inspection must be 
satisfactory to the IAA. Based on its experience in managing the airline's growth to date, management believes that 
there is a sufficient pool of qualified and licensed pilots, engineers and mechanics within the EU to satisfy Ryanair's 
anticipated future needs in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and quality control and that Ryanair will not 
face significant difficulty in hiring and continuing to employ the required personnel. Ryanair has also been able to 
satisfy its needs for additional pilots through the use of contract agencies.  These contract pilots are included in the 
table above. In addition, Ryanair has also been able to satisfy its needs for additional flight attendants through the 
use of contract agencies. These contract flight attendants are included in the table above.
 Ryanair has licensed approved organizations in Sweden and Holland to operate pilot training courses using 
Ryanair's syllabus, in order to grant Boeing 737 type-ratings. Each trainee pilot must pay for his or her own training 
and, based on his or her performance, he or she may be offered a position operating on Ryanair aircraft. This 
program enables Ryanair to secure a continuous stream of type-rated co-pilots.
 Ryanair's employees earn productivity-based incentive payments, including a sales bonus for onboard sales for 
flight attendants and payments based on the number of hours or sectors flown by pilots and flight attendants (within 
limits set by industry standards or regulations fixing maximum working hours). During the 2013 fiscal year, such 
productivity-based incentive payments accounted for approximately 46% of an average flight attendant's total 
earnings and approximately 35% of the typical pilot's compensation. Pilots at 54 out of Ryanair's 57 bases are 
covered by four or five year agreements on pay, allowances and rosters which variously fall due for negotiation 
between 2014 and 2018. In March 2012, Ryanair agreed to increase the pay of pilots and cabin crew in accordance 
with the terms of individual base agreements. The remaining employees who were not covered by base 
agreements had their salary frozen for a period of 12 months. Ryanair's pilots are currently subject to IAA-approved 
limits of 100 flight-hours per 28-day cycle and 900 flight-hours per fiscal year. For the 2013 fiscal year, the average 
flight-hours for Ryanair's pilots amounted to approximately 66.5 hours per month and approximately 798 hours for 
the complete year, a 5% decrease on the previous fiscal year. Were more stringent regulations on flight hours to be 
adopted, Ryanair's flight personnel could experience a reduction in their total pay due to lower compensation for the 
number of hours or sectors flown and Ryanair could be required to hire additional flight personnel.
 Ryanair considers its relations with its employees to be good. Ryanair currently negotiates with groups of 
employees, including its pilots, through "Employee Representation Committees" ("ERCs") regarding pay, work 
practices and conditions of employment, including conducting formal negotiations with these internal collective 
bargaining units. Ryanair's senior management meets regularly with the different ERCs to discuss all aspects of the 
business and those issues that specifically relate to each relevant employee group.
 On June 19, 2009, BALPA (the U.K. pilots union) made a request for voluntary recognition under applicable U.K. 
legislation, which Ryanair rejected. BALPA had the option of applying to the U.K.'s Central Arbitration Committee 
(CAC) to organize a vote on union recognition by Ryanair's pilots in relevant bargaining units, as determined by the 
CAC but BALPA decided not to proceed with an application at that time. The option to apply for a ballot remains 
open to BALPA and if it were to seek and be successful in such a ballot, it would be able to represent the U.K. pilots 
in negotiations over salaries and working conditions.
 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders have approved a number of share option plans for employees and directors. 
Ryanair Holdings has also issued share options to certain of its senior managers. For details of all outstanding 
share options, see "Item 10. Additional Information--Options to Purchase Securities from Registrant or

 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
 Except for the historical statements and discussions contained herein, statements contained in this 
report constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements may include words such as "expect," 
"estimate," "project," "anticipate," "should," "intend," and similar expressions or variations on such 
expressions. Any filing made by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") 
may include forward-looking statements. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute 
forward-looking statements have been made and may in the future be made by or on behalf of the Company,

specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European economy. 
Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are 
the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for 
replacement aircraft and aircraft maintenance services, aircraft availability, costs associated with 
environmental, safety and security measures, terrorist attacks, actions of the Irish, U.K., EU and other 
governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest 
rates, changes to the structure of the euro, airport handling and access charges, litigation, labor 
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, 
the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel, flight interruptions 
caused by volcanic ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions, factors affecting the value of 
Ryanair's investment in Aer Lingus Group plc and other factors discussed herein. The Company disclaims any

 Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 GENERAL
 Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and currency 
exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the negative impact of 
commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's earnings, cash flows and 
equity.
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including cross currency interest rate 
swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and commodity forwards. These derivative financial instruments are 
generally held to maturity and are not actively traded. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of 
hedging its operational and balance sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and 
currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralized completely.
 In executing its risk management strategy, Ryanair currently enters into forward contracts for the purchase of some 
of the jet fuel (jet kerosene) that it expects to use. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts intended to reduce 
its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, it enters into interest rate 
contracts with the objective of fixing certain borrowing costs and hedging principal repayments, particularly those 
associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-800s. Ryanair is also exposed to the risk that the counterparties to 
its derivative financial instruments may not be creditworthy. Were a counterparty to default on its obligations under 
any of the instruments described below, Ryanair's economic expectations when entering into these arrangements 
might not be achieved and its financial condition could be adversely affected. Transactions involving derivative 
financial instruments are also relatively illiquid as compared with those involving other kinds of financial instruments. 
It is Ryanair's policy not to enter into transactions involving financial derivatives for speculative purposes.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -56-
 The following paragraphs describe Ryanair's fuel hedging, foreign currency and interest rate swap arrangements 
and analyze the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of the financial instruments to hypothetical 
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates as if these changes had occurred at March 31, 
2013. The range of changes selected for this sensitivity analysis reflects Ryanair's view of the changes that are 
reasonably possible over a one-year period.
 FUEL PRICE EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 Fuel costs constitute a substantial portion of Ryanair's operating expenses (approximately 45.3% and 43.0% of 
such expenses in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, after taking into account Ryanair's fuel hedging 
activities). Ryanair engages in fuel price hedging transactions from time to time, pursuant to which Ryanair and a 
counterparty agree to exchange payments equal to the difference between a fixed price for a given quantity of jet 
fuel and the market price for such quantity of jet fuel at a given date in the future, with Ryanair receiving the amount 
of any excess of such market price over such fixed price and paying to the counterparty the amount of any deficit of 
such fixed price under such market price.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a much more 
selective basis. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs 
and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increases the Likelihood that the Company May Incur 
Losses" and "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks-Fuel Price Exposure and 
Hedging" for additional information on recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as 
well as certain associated risks. See also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2013 
Compared with Fiscal Year 2012-Fuel and Oil." As of July 26, 2013, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 
2014 at prices equivalent to approximately $980 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 26, 2013, Ryanair had 
entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering approximately 75% of its estimated requirements for 
the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 at prices equivalent to approximately $935 per metric ton, and 
had not entered into any jet fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period.
 While these hedging strategies can cushion the impact on Ryanair of fuel price increases in the short term, in the 
medium to longer-term, such strategies cannot be expected to eliminate the impact on the Company of an increase 
in the market price of jet fuel. The unrealized gains on outstanding forward agreements at March 31, 2013 and 
2012, based on their fair values, amounted to EUR34.9 million and EUR145.8 million (gross of tax), respectively. 
Based on Ryanair's fuel consumption for the 2013 fiscal year, a change of $1.00 in the average annual price per 
metric ton of jet fuel would have caused a change of approximately EUR1.7 million in Ryanair's fuel costs. See 
"Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability 
Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses."
 Under IFRS, the Company's fuel forward contracts are treated as cash-flow hedges of forecast fuel purchases for 
risks arising from the commodity price of fuel. The contracts are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are 
re-measured to fair value at the end of each fiscal period through equity to the extent effective, with any 
ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. The Company has considered these hedges to be highly 
effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from fluctuations in the market price of jet fuel because 
the jet fuel forward contracts typically relate to the same quantity, time, and location of delivery as the forecast jet 
fuel purchase being hedged and the duration of the contracts is typically short. Accordingly, the quantification of the 
change in expected cash flows of the forecast jet fuel purchase is based on the jet fuel forward price, and in the 
2013 fiscal year, the Company recorded no hedge ineffectiveness within earnings. The Company has recorded no 
level of ineffectiveness on its jet fuel hedges in its income statements to date. In the 2013 fiscal year, the Company 
recorded a positive fair-value adjustment of EUR30.6 million (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive 
income in respect of jet fuel forward contracts, and in the 2012 fiscal year, the Company recorded a positive fair-
value adjustment of EUR127.6 million (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive income.
 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 In recent years, Ryanair's revenues have been denominated primarily in two currencies, the euro and U.K. pound 
sterling. The U.K. pound sterling and the euro accounted for approximately 25% and 63%, respectively, of Ryanair's 
total revenues in the 2013 fiscal year, as compared to approximately 24% and 65%, respectively, in the 2012 fiscal 
year. As Ryanair reports its results in euro, the Company is not exposed to any material currency risk as a result of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -56-
its euro-denominated activities. Ryanair's operating expenses are primarily denominated in euro, U.K. pounds 
sterling and U.S. dollars. Ryanair's operations can be subject to significant direct exchange rate risks between the 
euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its operating costs (particularly those related to fuel 
purchases) is incurred in U.S. dollars, while none of its revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. Appreciation of 
the euro against the U.S. dollar positively impacts Ryanair's operating income because the euro equivalent of its 
U.S. dollar operating costs decreases, while depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar negatively impacts 
operating income. It is Ryanair's policy to hedge a significant portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the exchange 
rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. From time to time, Ryanair hedges its operating surpluses and shortfalls 
in U.K. pound sterling. Ryanair matches certain U.K. pound sterling costs with U.K. pound sterling revenues and 
may choose to sell any surplus U.K. pound sterling cash flows for euro.
 Hedging associated with the income statement. In the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years, the Company entered into a 
series of forward contracts, principally euro/U.S. dollar forward contracts to hedge against variability in cash flows 
arising from market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates associated with its forecast fuel, maintenance and 
insurance costs and euro/U.K. pound sterling forward contracts to hedge certain surplus U.K. pound sterling cash 
flows. At March 31, 2013, the total unrealized gain relating to these contracts amounted to EUR47.4 million, 
compared to a EUR89.4 million unrealized loss at March 31, 2012.

Body
 Directors meet with key executives with a particular focus on ensuring non-executive directors are fully 
informed on issues of relevance to Ryanair and its operations. Extensive papers on key business issues are 
provided to all directors in connection with the Board meetings. All directors are encouraged to update 
and refresh their skills and knowledge, for example, through attending courses on technical areas or 
external briefings for non-executive directors.
 On appointment in December 2012, the directors Louise Phelan and Julie O'Neill had briefings with the 
senior management of the Company, covering a review of the business of the Group and their specific areas 
of finance, commercial, personnel and operations.  Similar briefings will also be provided to Dick 
Milliken, the newly appointed director.
 The Company has Directors & Officers liability insurance in place in respect of any legal actions taken 
against the directors in the course of the exercise of their duties. New non-executive directors are 
encouraged to meet the executive director and senior management for briefing on the Company's developments 
and plans.
 Meetings
 The Board meets at least on a quarterly basis and in the year to March 31, 2013 the Board convened 
meetings on nine occasions. Individual attendance at these meetings is set out in the table on page 22. 
Detailed Board papers are circulated in advance so that Board members have adequate time and information 
to be able to participate fully at the meeting.
 The holding of detailed regular Board meetings and the fact that many matters require Board approval, 
show that the running of the Company is firmly in the hands of the Board. The non-executive directors meet 
periodically without executives being present. Led by the senior independent director, the non-executive 
directors will meet without the chairman present at least annually to appraise the chairman's performance 
and on such other occasions as are deemed appropriate.
 Remuneration
 Details of remuneration paid to the directors are set out in Note 19 to the consolidated Financial 
Statements on pages 188 to 190. Also, please see the Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors' 
Remuneration on page 27.
 Non-executive directors
 Non-executive directors are remunerated by way of directors' fees.  A number of non-executive directors 
have share options. While the 2010 Code notes that the remuneration of the non-executive director should 
not include share options, the Board believes that the quantum of options granted to non-executive 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -6-
directors is not so significant as to raise any issue concerning their independence. Michael Horgan is 
remunerated on a consultancy basis on safety issues and also by way of share options.
 Full details are disclosed in Note 19(b) and 19(d) on pages 189 to 190 of the consolidated financial 
statements.
 Executive director remuneration
 The Chief Executive of the Company is the only executive director on the Board. In addition to his base 
salary he is eligible for a performance bonus of up to 100% of salary and other bonuses dependent upon the 
achievement of certain financial targets and a pension. It is considered that the significant shareholding 
of the Chief Executive acts to align his interests with those of shareholders and gives him a keen 
incentive to perform to the highest levels.
 Full details of the executive director's remuneration are set out in Note 19(a) on page 189 of the 
consolidated financial statements.
 Share Ownership and Dealing
 Details of the directors' interests in Ryanair shares are set out in Note 19(d) on page 190 of the 
consolidated financial statements.
 The Board has adopted The Model Code, as set out in the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange and the 
UK Listing Authority, as the code of dealings applicable to dealings in Ryanair shares by directors and 
relevant Company employees. The code of dealing also includes provisions which are intended to ensure 
compliance with US securities laws and regulations of the NASDAQ National market. Under the policy, 
directors are required to obtain clearance from the Chairman or Chief Executive before dealing in Ryanair 
shares, whilst relevant Company employees must obtain clearance from designated senior management and are 
prohibited from dealing in the shares during prohibited periods as defined by the Listing Rules and at any 
time at which the individual is in possession of inside information (as defined in the Market Abuse 
(Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations 2005).
 Board Succession and Structure
 The Board plans for its own succession with guidance from the Nomination Committee. The Nomination 
Committee regularly review the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and 
experience) required of the Board compared to its current position with regard to the strategic needs of 
Ryanair and recommends changes to the Board. There is a formal, thorough and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors to the Board. The Nominations Committee identifies and selects candidates on 
merit against objective criteria, to ensure that the Board have the skills, knowledge and expertise 
required.
 Three new independent directors, Louise Phelan and Julie O'Neill were appointed in December 2012 while 
Dick Milliken was appointed in July 2013.  The Board currently comprises of ten directors, Chief Executive 
Officer, Michael O' Leary, is the only executive director. The nine non-executive directors include 
Chairman David Bonderman. Biographies of all current directors are set out on pages 102 of this report. 
Ryanair considers that the Board has the correct balance and depth of skills, knowledge, expertise and 
experience to optimally lead the Company and that all directors give adequate time to the performance of 
their duties and responsibilities.
 Ryanair considers that all directors discharge their directorial duties with the objectivity and 
impartiality they have demonstrated since commencing their respective roles and has determined that each 
of the non-executive directors is independent. In reaching that conclusion, Ryanair considered the 
character, judgement, objectivity and integrity of each director and had due regard for the 2010 Code and 
the new 2012 Code which will apply to Ryanair from April 1, 2013. Ryanair continually endeavors to 
maintain the quality and independence of its Board.
 Board Committees
 The Board of Directors has established a number of committees, including the following:
 Executive Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Executive Committee in August 1996. The Executive Committee can 
exercise the powers exercisable by the full Board of Directors in circumstances in which action by the 
Board of Directors is required but it is impracticable to convene a meeting of the full Board of 
Directors. Messrs. David Bonderman, Michael O'Leary, Kyran McLaughlin and James Osborne are the members of 
the Executive Committee.
 Audit Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Audit Committee in September 1996. The Audit Committee currently 
comprises three independent non-executive directors, Declan McKeon (Chairman), Charles McCreevy and James 
Osborne, considered by the Board to be independent. The Board has determined that Declan McKeon is the 
Committee's financial expert.
 The Committee met six times during the year ended March 31, 2013. Individual attendance at these meetings 
is set out in the table on page 22. It can be seen from the director biographies, appearing on page 102, 
that the members of the Committee bring to it a wide range of experience and expertise. The Chief 
Financial Officer, Finance Director, Financial Controller and the Head of Internal Audit normally attend 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -6-
meetings of the Committee.   The external auditors attend as required and have direct access to the 
Committee Chairman at all times. The Committee also meets separately at least once a year with the 
external auditors and with the Head of Internal Audit without executive management being present.
 The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in its written terms of reference, which 
are available on the Company's website www.ryanair.com, and include:
 --   monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and any formal announcements 
relating to the Company's financial performance including profit guidance, and reviewing significant 
financial reporting judgments contained in them;
 --   reviewing the interim and annual financial statements before submission to the Board;
 --   reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's internal financial controls and risk management systems;

with the accountants the plans for and scope of each annual audit, the audit procedures to be utilised and 
the results of the audit;
 --   approving the remuneration of the external auditors, whether fees for audit or non audit services, 
and ensuring the level of fees is appropriate to enable an adequate audit to be conducted;

possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters and ensuring that these arrangements allow 
proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow up action.
 These responsibilities of the Committee are discharged in the following ways:

 In December 2005, Ryanair completed the fleet replacement program it commenced in 1999. All of Ryanair's 
older Boeing 737-200A aircraft were replaced with Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, and Ryanair 
now operates a single-aircraft-type fleet of Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft with an average age 
of just over 4.5 years. The design of the new aircraft is aimed at minimizing drag, thereby reducing the 
rate of fuel burn and noise levels. The engines are also quieter and more fuel-efficient. Furthermore, by 
moving to an all Boeing 737-800 "next generation" fleet, Ryanair reduced the unit emissions per passenger 
due to the inherent capacity increase in the Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The Boeing 737-800 "next generation" 
aircraft have a significantly superior fuel-burn to passenger-kilometer ratio than Ryanair's former fleet 
of Boeing 737-200A aircraft. See "-Aircraft" above for details on Ryanair's fleet plan.
 Ryanair has also installed winglets on all of its existing aircraft and all future aircraft will also be 
fitted with winglets. Winglets reduce both the rate of fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions by 
approximately 4% and also reduce noise emissions.
 In addition, Ryanair has distinctive operational characteristics that management believes are helpful to 
the general environment. In particular, Ryanair:
 --      operates with a high-seat density of 189 seats and an all-economy configuration, as opposed to 
the 162 seats and two-class configuration of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft used by traditional network 
airlines, reducing fuel burn and emissions per seat-kilometer flown;
 --      has reduced per-passenger emissions through higher load factors;
 --      better utilizes existing infrastructure by operating out of underutilized secondary and regional 
airports throughout Europe, which limits the use of holding patterns and taxiing times, thus reducing fuel 
burn and emissions and reducing the need for new airport infrastructure;
 --      provides direct services as opposed to connecting flights, in order to limit the need for 
passengers to transfer at main hubs and thus reduces the number of take-offs and landings per journey from 
four to two, reducing fuel burn and emissions per journey;
 --      has no late-night departures of aircraft, reducing the impact of noise emissions; and
 --      is currently evaluating the benefits of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, a variant of the 737, with 
new more fuel-efficient engines.
 Emissions Trading. On November 19, 2008, the European Council of Ministers adopted legislation to add 
aviation to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as of 2012. This scheme, which has thus far applied mainly to 
energy producers, is a cap-and-trade system for CO(2) emissions to encourage industries to improve their 
CO(2) efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines were granted initial CO(2) allowances based on 
historical "revenue ton kilometers" and a CO(2) efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of allowances has to be 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -32-
purchased in the open market and/or at government auctions. Management believes that this legislation is 
likely to have a negative impact on the European airline industry. Ryanair takes its environmental 
responsibilities seriously and intends to continue to improve its environmental efficiency and to minimize 
emissions.
 Aviation Taxes. Ryanair is fundamentally opposed to the introduction of any aviation taxes, including any 
environmental taxes, fuel taxes or emissions levies. Ryanair has and continues to offer the lowest fares 
in Europe, to make passenger air travel affordable and accessible to European consumers. Ryanair believes 
that the imposition of additional taxes on airlines will not only increase airfares, but will discourage 
new entrants into the market, resulting in less choice for consumers. Ryanair believes this would 
ultimately have adverse effects on the European economy in general. There is in particular no 
justification for any environmental taxes on aviation following the introduction of the Emissions Trading 
Scheme for airlines.
 As a company, Ryanair believes in free market competition and that the imposition of aviation taxation 
would favor the less efficient flag carriers - which generally have smaller and older aircraft, lower load 
factors, and a much higher fuel burn per passenger, and which operate primarily into congested airports - 
and reduce competition. Furthermore, the introduction of a tax at a European level only would distort 
competition between airlines operating solely within Europe and those operating also outside of Europe. We 
believe that the introduction of such a tax would also be incompatible with international law.
 Airport charges
 The EU Airport Charges Directive of March 2009 sets forth general principles that are to be followed by 
airports with more than five million passenger per annum, and all capital city airports irrespective of 
their passenger throughput, when setting airport charges, and provides for an appeals procedure for 
airlines in the event they are not satisfied with the level of charges. However, Ryanair does not believe 
that this procedure will be effective or that it will constrain those airports that are currently abusing 
their dominant position, in part because the legislation was mis-transposed in certain countries, such as 
Ireland and Spain, so as to deprive airlines of even the basic safeguards provided for in the Directive. 
This legislation may in fact lead to higher airport charges, depending on how its provisions are applied 
by EU member states and subsequently by the courts.
 Slots
 Currently, the majority of Ryanair's bases of operations have no "slot" allocation restrictions; however, 
traffic at a substantial number of the airports Ryanair serves, including its primary bases, are regulated 
by means of "slot" allocations, which represent authorizations to take off or land at a particular airport 
within a specified time period. In addition, EU law currently regulates the acquisition, transfer, and 
loss of slots. Applicable EU regulations currently prohibit the buying or selling of slots for cash. The 
European Commission adopted a regulation in April 2004 (Regulation (EC) No. 793/2004) that made some minor 
amendments to the current allocation system, allowing for limited transfers of, but not trading in, slots. 
Slots may be transferred from one route to another by the same carrier, transferred within a group or as 
part of a change of control of a carrier, or swapped between carriers. In April 2008, the European 
Commission issued a communication on the application of the slot allocation regulation, signaling the 
acceptance of secondary trading of airport slots between airlines. This is expected to allow more 
flexibility and mobility in the use of slots and will further enhance possibilities for market entry at 
slot constrained airports. Any future legislation that might create an official secondary market for slots 
could create a potential source of revenue for certain of Ryanair's current and potential competitors, 
many of which have many more slots allocated at primary airports at present than Ryanair. The European 
Union is currently considering such proposals as part of a review of the slots legislation, which is 
currently expected to be completed in 2014. Slot values depend on several factors, including the airport, 
time of day covered, the availability of slots and the class of aircraft. Ryanair's ability to gain access 
to and develop its operations at slot-controlled airports will be affected by the availability of slots 
for takeoffs and landings at these specific airports. New entrants to an airport are currently given 
certain privileges in terms of obtaining slots, but such privileges are subject to the grandfathered 
rights of existing operators that are utilizing their slots. While Ryanair generally seeks to avoid slot-
controlled airports, there is no assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a sufficient number of 
slots at the slot-controlled airports that it desires to serve in the future at the time it needs them or 
on acceptable terms.
 Other
 Health and occupational safety issues relating to the Company are largely addressed in Ireland by the 
Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and other regulations under that act. Although licenses or 
permits are not issued under such legislation, compliance is monitored by the Health and Safety Authority 
(the "Authority"), which is the regulating body in this area. The Authority periodically reviews Ryanair's 
health and safety record and when appropriate, issues improvement notices or prohibition notices. Ryanair 
has responded to all such notices to the satisfaction of the Authority. Other safety issues are covered by 
the Irish Aviation Orders, which may vary from time to time.

 The Company's operations are subject to the general laws of Ireland and, insofar as they are applicable 
in Ireland, the laws of the EU. The Company may also become subject to additional regulatory requirements 
in the future. The Company is also subject to local laws and regulations at locations where it operates 
and the regulations of various local authorities that operate the airports it serves.

Body
 The following discussion and analysis of Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations is based on its 
consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 18 and prepared in accordance with IFRS.
 The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 The Company believes that its critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's most 
difficult, subjective and complex judgments, are those described in this section. These critical accounting policies, 
the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of these policies and the sensitivity of reported results to 
changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered in reviewing the consolidated financial 
statements included in Item 18 and the discussion and analysis below. For additional detail on these policies, see 
Note 1, "Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements included 
in Item 18.
 Long-lived Assets
 As of March 31, 2013, Ryanair had EUR4.9 billion of long-lived assets, virtually all of which were aircraft. In 
accounting for long-lived assets, Ryanair must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the 
expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and 
the cash flows they generate.
 In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of all of the Company's aircraft, valuations 
from appraisers and other available marketplace information. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can 
be significant, could be caused by changes to Ryanair's maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft, 
governmental regulations on aging of aircraft, changes in new aircraft technology, changes in governmental and 
environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel efficiency and changing market prices for new and used aircraft of 
the same or similar types. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when 
warranted, adjusts these assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis, 
through depreciation expense.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -35-
 Ryanair periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment 
would include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an aircraft, a significant change in 
an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the aircraft. While the 
airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these factors from time to time, Ryanair has not yet been 
seriously impacted and continues to record positive cash flows from these long-lived assets. Consequently, Ryanair 
has not yet identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its 
long-lived assets and the general airline operating environment.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market value of 
new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft disposals during prior 
periods. Aircraft are depreciated over a useful life of 23 years from the date of manufacture to residual value.
 Heavy Maintenance
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed, on acquisition, to its service potential, reflecting the 
maintenance condition of the engines and airframe.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return the aircraft 
in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the airframe, engines and life-
limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, maintenance, in the form of major airframe 
overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, is required to be performed during 
the period of the lease and upon return of the aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance 
costs and the costs associated with the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or 
loss over the lease term for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of 
the major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely correlates with 
the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and replenish aircraft held under 
operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the control of Ryanair. While Ryanair may, in very 
limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under 
the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such sub-leasing.
 Both of these elements of accounting policies involve the use of estimates in determining the quantum of both the 
initial maintenance asset and/or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the respective periods over which 
such amounts are charged to income. In making such estimates, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, industry regulations and recommendations from Boeing; however, these estimates can be 
subject to revision, depending on a number of factors, such as the timing of the planned maintenance, the ultimate 
utilization of the aircraft, changes to government regulations and increases or decreases in estimated costs. 
Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts its 
assumptions, which generally impact maintenance and depreciation expense in the income statement on a 
prospective basis.

 Notes forming part of the Company Financial Statements
 29           Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), which are effective for the year ended and as at 
March 31, 2013, as applied in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012.  On publishing parent 
entity financial statements together with group financial statements the Company is taking advantage of 
the exemption contained in Section 148(8) of the Companies Act, 1963 not to present its individual income 
statement, statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these approved 
financial statements.
 The Company financial statements are presented in euro millions, being its functional currency. They are 
prepared on an historical cost basis except for certain share based payment transactions, which are based 
on fair values determined at grant date.
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to makejudgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses.  These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. These 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period 
of the revision and future periods if these are also affected. Principal sources of estimation uncertainty 
have been set out in the critical accounting policy section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Such uncertainties may impact the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries at future 
dates.
 Statement of compliance
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -91-
 The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, which 
are effective at March 31, 2013 as applied in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012.
 The directors have reviewed all EU endorsed IFRSs, effective for future financial years,  as set forth in 
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, and have concluded their adoption will not have a 
significant impact on the parent entity financial statements.
 Share-based payments
 The Company accounts for the fair value of share options granted to employees of a subsidiary as an 
increase in its investment in that subsidiary. The fair value of such options is determined in a 
consistent manner to that set out in the Group share-based payment accounting policy and as set out in 
Note 15 (c) to the consolidated financial statements.
 Income taxes
 Income taxes are accounted for by the Company in a manner consistent to that set out in the Group income 
tax accounting policy.
 Financial assets
 The Company holds investments in subsidiary companies, which are carried at cost less any impairments.
 Guarantees
 The Company occasionally guarantees certain liabilities of subsidiary companies. These are considered to 
be insurance arrangements and are accounted for as such i.e. a contingent liability until such time as it 
becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
 Loans and borrowings
 All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of consideration received, net of 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest bearing loans are 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.

At March 31, 2013, Ryanair Holdings plc had borrowings of EUR35.2 million (2012: EUR35.2 million; 2011: 
EUR35.2 million) from Ryanair Limited. The loan is interest free and repayable on demand.
 33    Financial instruments
 The Company does not undertake hedging activities on behalf of itself or other companies within the 
Group. Financial instruments in the Company primarily take the form of loans to subsidiary undertakings.
 Amounts due to or from subsidiary undertakings (primarily Ryanair Limited) in the form of inter-company 
loans are interest free and are repayable upon demand and further details of these have been given in 
Notes 31 and 32 of the parent entity financial statements. These inter-company balances are eliminated in 
the group consolidation.
 The euro is the functional and presentation currency of the Company's balance sheet and all transactions 
entered into by the Company are euro denominated. As such, the Company does not have any significant 
foreign currency risk.
 The credit risk associated with the Company's financial assets principally relates to the credit risk of 
the Ryanair group as a whole, which is not rated by an external rating agency. Additionally the Company 
had guaranteed certain of its subsidiary company liabilities. Details of these arrangements are given in 
Note 34 to the company financial statements.
 34    Contingencies
 a) The Company has provided EUR5,973.6 million (2012: EUR5,503.4 million; 2011: EUR5,349.6  million) in 
letters of guarantee to secure obligations of subsidiary undertakings in respect of loans, bank advances 
and long dated foreign currency transactions.
 b)  In order to avail itself of the exemption contained in Section 17 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 
1986, the holding company, Ryanair Holdings plc, has guaranteed the liabilities of its subsidiary 
undertakings registered in Ireland. As a result, the subsidiary undertakings have been exempted from the 
provisions of Section 7 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986. Details of the Group's principal 
subsidiaries have been included at Note 27. The Irish subsidiaries of the Group covered by the Section 17 
exemption are listed at Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements also. Four additional Irish 
subsidiaries covered by this exemption, which are not listed as principal subsidiaries at Note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements, are Airport Marketing Services Limited, FRC Investments Limited, 
Coinside Limited and Mazine Limited.

 Airline Industry Margins are Subject to Significant Uncertainty. The airline industry is capital intensive and is 
characterized by high fixed costs and by revenues that generally exhibit substantially greater elasticity than costs. 
Although fuel accounted for approximately 45% of total operating expenses in the 2013 fiscal year, management 
anticipates that this percentage may vary significantly in future years. See "-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel 
Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse Impact on the Company's 
Profitability" above. The operating costs of each flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers flown, 
and therefore, a relatively small change in the number of passengers, fare pricing, or traffic mix could have a 
disproportionate effect on operating and financial results. Accordingly, a relatively minor shortfall from expected 
revenue levels could have a material adverse effect on the Company's growth or financial performance. See "Item 
5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects." The very low marginal costs incurred for providing services to 
passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats are also a factor in the industry's high susceptibility to price 
discounting. See "Risks Related to the Company-The Company Faces Significant Price and Other Pressures in a 
Highly Competitive Environment" above.
 Safety-Related Undertakings Could Affect the Company's Results. Aviation authorities in Europe and the United 
States periodically require or suggest that airlines implement certain safety-related procedures on their aircraft. In 
recent years, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") has required a number of such procedures with 
regard to Boeing 737-800 aircraft, including checks of rear pressure bulkheads and flight control modules, redesign 
of the rudder control system, and limitations on certain operating procedures. Ryanair's policy is to implement any 
such required procedures in accordance with FAA guidance and to perform such procedures in close collaboration 
with Boeing. To date, all such procedures have been conducted as part of Ryanair's standard maintenance 
programme and have not interrupted flight schedules nor required any material increases in Ryanair's maintenance 
expenses. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA or other regulatory authorities will not recommend or 
require other safety-related undertakings or that such undertakings would not adversely impact Ryanair's operating 
results or financial condition.
 There also can be no assurance that new regulations will not be implemented in the future that would apply to 
Ryanair's aircraft and result in an increase in Ryanair's cost of maintenance or other costs beyond management's 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -22-
current estimates. In addition, should Ryanair's aircraft cease to be sufficiently reliable or should any public 
perception develop that Ryanair's aircraft are less than completely reliable, Ryanair's business could be materially 
adversely affected.
 Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary Shares or ADRs
 EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals, and 
the Company Has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals. EU Regulation No. 
1008/2008 requires that, in order to obtain and retain an operating license, an EU air carrier must be majority-
owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals. The regulation does not specify what level of share ownership will 
confer effective control on a holder or holders of Ordinary Shares. The Board of Directors of Ryanair Holdings is 
given certain powers under Ryanair Holdings' articles of association (the "Articles") to take action to ensure that the 
number of Ordinary Shares held in Ryanair Holdings by non-EU nationals ("Affected Shares") does not reach a 
level that could jeopardize the Company's entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any license, permit, 
consent, or privilege which it holds or enjoys and which enables it to carry on business as an air carrier. The 
directors, from time to time, set a "Permitted Maximum" on the number of the Company's Ordinary Shares that may 
be owned by non-EU nationals at such level as they believe will comply with EU law. The Permitted Maximum is 
currently set at 49.9%. In addition, under certain circumstances, the directors can take action to safeguard the 
Company's ability to operate by identifying those Ordinary Shares, American Depositary Shares ("ADSs") or 
Affected Shares which give rise to the need to take action and treat such Ordinary Shares, the American Depositary 
Receipts ("ADRs") evidencing such ADSs, or Affected Shares as "Restricted Shares." The Board of Directors may, 
under certain circumstances, deprive holders of Restricted Shares of their rights to attend, vote at, and speak at 
general meetings, and/or require such holders to dispose of their Restricted Shares to an EU national within as little 
as 21 days. The directors are also given the power to transfer such Restricted Shares themselves if a holder fails to 
comply. In 2002, the Company implemented measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to purchase 
Ordinary Shares, and non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares, and will 
remain so for as long as these restrictions remain in place. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will 
ever be lifted. Additionally, these foreign ownership restrictions could result in Ryanair's exclusion from certain stock 
tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the market price of the Ordinary Shares and ADRs. On 
April 19, 2012, the Company obtained shareholder approval to repurchase ADRs as part of its general authority to 
repurchase up to 5% of the issued share capital in the Company. On June 5, 2013 the Company repurchased 
2,018,800 ADRs equivalent to 10,094,000 ordinary shares at a price of EUR7.65 per ordinary share. See "Item 10. 
Additional Information-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" for a detailed discussion of 
restrictions on share ownership and the current ban on share purchases by non-EU nationals.
 As of June 30, 2013, EU nationals owned at least 55.2% of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares (assuming 
conversion of all outstanding ADRs into Ordinary Shares).
 Holders of Ordinary Shares are Currently Unable to Convert those Shares into American Depositary Receipts. In 
an effort to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, Ryanair Holdings 
instructed The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary for its ADR program (the "Depositary"), to suspend the 
issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary Shares until further notice. Holders of Ordinary 
Shares cannot convert their Ordinary Shares into ADRs during this suspension, and there can be no assurance that 
the suspension will ever be lifted. See also "-EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' 
Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals and the Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares 
by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 The Company's Results of Operations May Fluctuate Significantly. The Company's results of operations have 
varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. See "Item 5. 
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Seasonal Fluctuations." Among the factors causing these variations 
are the airline industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions, the seasonal nature of air travel, and trends in 
airlines' costs, especially fuel costs. Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is 
discretionary, the industry tends to experience adverse financial results during general economic downturns. The 
Company is substantially dependent on discretionary air travel.
 The trading price of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares and ADRs may be subject to wide fluctuations in response 
to quarterly variations in the Company's operating results and the operating results of other airlines. In addition, the 
global stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -22-
prices of many airline company stocks. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of 
the Ordinary Shares and ADRs.
 Ryanair Holdings May or May Not Pay Dividends. Since its incorporation as the holding company for Ryanair in 
1996, Ryanair Holdings has only twice declared dividends on its Ordinary Shares. The directors of the Company 
declared on June 1, 2010 that Ryanair Holdings intended to pay a special dividend of EUR500 million, and following 
shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on September 22, 2010 this special dividend was paid on 
October 1, 2010. Directors of the Company also declared on May 21, 2012 that Ryanair Holdings intended to pay a 
special dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary share (approx. EUR492 million) and following shareholder approval at the 
annual general meeting on September 21, 2012 this special dividend was paid on November 30, 2012. The 
Company may pay other dividends from time to time. In June, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to 
EUR1 billion to shareholders over the next two years with at least EUR400.0 million (EUR176.6 million already 
completed in June 2013) in share buybacks to be completed in the fiscal year to March 31, 2014 and up to a further 
EUR600.0 million in either special dividends or share buybacks expected in fiscal 2015 (subject to shareholder 
approval, continuing profitability, the economic environment, capital expenditure and other commitments). See 
"Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Dividend Policy." As a holding company, Ryanair 
Holdings does not have any material assets other than the shares of Ryanair.

Body
 Ryanair Holdings maintains a separate register (the "Separate Register") of Ordinary Shares in which non-EU 
nationals, whether individuals, bodies corporate or other entities, have an interest (such shares are referred to as 
"Affected Shares" in the Articles). Interest in this context is widely defined and includes any interest held through 
ADRs in the shares underlying the relevant ADRs. The directors can require relevant parties to provide them with 
information to enable a determination to be made by the directors as to whether Ordinary Shares are, or are to be 
treated as, Affected Shares. If such information is not available or forthcoming or is unsatisfactory then the directors 
can, at their discretion, determine that Ordinary Shares are to be treated as Affected Shares. Registered holders of 
Ordinary Shares are also obliged to notify the Company if they are aware that any Ordinary Share which they hold 
ought to be treated as an Affected Share for this purpose. With regard to ADRs, the directors can treat all of the 
relevant underlying shares as Affected Shares unless satisfactory evidence as to why they should not be so treated 
is forthcoming.
 In the event that, inter alia, (i) the refusal, withholding, suspension or revocation of any License or the imposition of 
any condition which materially inhibits the exercise of any License (an "Intervening Act") has taken place, (ii) the 
Company receives a notice or direction from any governmental body or any other body which regulates the 
provision of air transport services to the effect that an Intervening Act is imminent, threatened or intended or (iii) an 
Intervening Act may occur as a consequence of the level of non-EU ownership of Ordinary Shares or an Intervening 
Act is imminent, threatened or intended because of the manner of share ownership or control of Ryanair Holdings 
generally, the directors can take action pursuant to the Articles to deal with the situation. They can, inter alia, (i) 
remove any directors or change the chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) identify those Ordinary Shares, ADRs or 
Affected Shares which give rise to the need to take action and treat such Ordinary Shares, ADRs, or Affected 
Shares as Restricted Shares (see below) or (iii) set a "Permitted Maximum" on the number of Affected Shares 
which may subsist at any time (which may not, save in the circumstances referred to below, be lower than 40% of 
the total number of issued shares) and treat any Affected Shares (or ADRs representing such Affected Shares) in 
excess of this Permitted Maximum as Restricted Shares (see below).
 In addition to the above, if as a consequence of a change of law or a direction, notice or requirement of any state, 
authority or person it is necessary to reduce the total number of Affected Shares below 40% or reduce the number 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -53-
of Affected Shares held by any particular stockholder or stockholders in order to overcome, prevent or avoid an 
Intervening Act, the directors may resolve to (i) set the Permitted Maximum at such level below 40% as they 
consider necessary in order to overcome, prevent or avoid such Intervening Act, or (ii) treat such number of 
Affected Shares (or ADRs representing Affected Shares) held by any particular stockholder or stockholders as they 
consider necessary (which could include all of such Affected Shares or ADRs) as Restricted Shares (see below). 
The directors may serve a Restricted Share Notice in respect of any Affected Share, or any ADR representing any 
ADS, which is to be treated as a Restricted Share. Such notices can have the effect of depriving the recipients of 
the rights to attend, vote at and speak at general meetings, which they would otherwise have as a consequence of 
holding such Ordinary Shares or ADRs. Such notices can also require the recipients to dispose of the Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs concerned to an EU national (so that the relevant shares (or shares underlying the relevant ADRs) 
will then cease to be Affected Shares) within 21 days or such longer period as the directors may determine. The 
directors are also given the power to transfer such Restricted Shares, themselves, in cases of non-compliance with 
the Restricted Share Notice.
 To enable the directors to identify Affected Shares, transferees of Ordinary Shares are generally required to 
provide a declaration as to the nationality of persons having interests in those shares. Stockholders are also obliged 
to notify Ryanair Holdings if they are aware that any shares, which they hold, ought to be treated as Affected 
Shares for this purpose. Purchasers or transferees of ADRs need not complete a nationality declaration because 
the directors expect to treat all of the Ordinary Shares held by the Depositary as Affected Shares. ADS holders 
must open ADR accounts directly with the Depositary if they wish to provide to Ryanair Holdings nationality 
declarations or such other evidence as the directors may require in order to establish to the directors' satisfaction 
that the Ordinary Shares underlying such holder's ADRs are not Affected Shares.
 In deciding which Affected Shares are to be selected as Restricted Shares, the directors can take into account 
which Affected Shares have given rise to the necessity to take action. Subject to that they will, insofar as 
practicable, firstly view as Restricted Shares those Affected Shares in respect of which no declaration as to whether 
or not such shares are Affected Shares has been made by the holder thereof and where information which has 
been requested by the directors in accordance with the Articles has not been provided within specified time periods 
and, secondly, have regard to the chronological order in which details of Affected Shares have been entered in the 
Separate Register and, accordingly, treat the most recently registered Affected Shares as Restricted Shares to the 
extent necessary. Transfers of Affected Shares to Affiliates (as that expression is defined in the Articles) will not 
affect the chronological order of entry in the Separate Register for this purpose. The directors do however have the 
discretion to apply another basis of selection if, in their sole opinion, that would be more equitable. Where the 
directors have resolved to treat Affected Shares held by any particular stockholder or stockholders as Restricted 
Shares (i) because such Affected Shares have given rise to the need to take such action or (ii) because of a change 
of law or a requirement or direction of a regulatory authority necessitating such action (see above), such powers 
may be exercised irrespective of the date upon which such Affected Shares were entered in the Separate Register.
 After having initially resolved to set the maximum level at 49.0%, the directors increased the maximum level to 
49.9% on May 26, 1999, after the number of Affected Shares exceeded the initial limit. This maximum level could 
be reduced if it becomes necessary for the directors to exercise these powers in the circumstances described 
above. The decision to make any such reduction or to change the Permitted Maximum from time to time will be 
published in at least one national newspaper in Ireland and in any country in which the Ordinary Shares or ADRs 
are listed. The relevant notice will specify the provisions of the Articles that apply to Restricted Shares and the 
name of the person or persons who will answer queries relating to Restricted Shares on behalf of Ryanair Holdings. 
The directors shall publish information as to the number of shares held by EU nationals annually.
 In an effort to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, Ryanair 
Holdings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADSs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary 
Shares until further notice to its shareholders. Holders of Ordinary Shares cannot convert their Ordinary Shares into 
ADRs during such suspension, and there can be no assurance that the suspension will ever be lifted.
 As a further measure to increase the percentage of Ordinary Shares held by EU nationals, on February 7, 2002, 
the Company issued a notice to shareholders to the effect that any purchase of Ordinary Shares by a non-EU 
national after such date will immediately result in the issue of a Restricted Share Notice to such non-EU national 
Purchaser. The Restricted Share Notice compels the non-EU national purchaser to sell the Affected Shares to an 
EU national within 21 days of the date of issuance. In the event that any such non-EU national shareholder does 
not sell its Ordinary Shares to an EU national within the specified time period, the Company can then take legal 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -53-
action to compel such a sale. As a result, non-EU nationals are effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares 
for as long as these restrictions remain in place. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will ever be 
lifted.
 As an additional measure, to ensure the percentage of shares held by EU nationals remains at least 50.1%, at the 
extraordinary general meeting held on April 19, 2012, the Company obtained a new repurchase authority which will 
enable the repurchase of ADRs for up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ
 Concerns about the foreign ownership restrictions described above could result in the exclusion of Ryanair from 
certain stock tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the market price of the Ordinary Shares and 
ADRs. See also "Item 3. Risk Factors--Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Shares or ADRs-EU Rules 
Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals and the 
Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 As of June 30, 2013, EU nationals owned at least 55.2% of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares (assuming 
conversion of all outstanding ADRs into Ordinary Shares). Ryanair continuously monitors the ownership status of its 
Ordinary Shares, which changes on a daily basis.

Finance leases
 The Company financed 30 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 2005 and March 2013 with 13-
year euro-denominated Japanese Operating Leases with Call Options ("JOLCOs"). These structures are accounted 
for as finance leases and are initially recorded at fair value in the Company's balance sheet. Under each of these 
contracts, Ryanair has a call option to purchase the aircraft at a pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, 
which it may exercise.
 The following table sets out the total future minimum payments of leasing 30 aircraft (2012: 30 aircraft; 2011: 30

Commitments resulting from the use of derivative financial instruments by the Company are described in 
Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
 Contingencies
 The Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Management does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Company. Should the Company be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial position.
 In February 2004, the European Commission ruled that Ryanair had received illegal state aid from the 
Walloon regional government in connection with its establishment of a low cost base at Brussels 
(Charleroi). Ryanair advised the regional government that it believed no money was repayable as the cost 
of establishing the base exceeded the amount determined to be illegal state aid. Ryanair also appealed the 
decision of the European Commission to the European Court of First Instance ("CFI"), requesting that the 
Court annul the decision on the basis that Ryanair's agreement at Brussels (Charleroi) was consistent with 
agreements at similar privately owned airports and therefore did not constitute illegal state aid. The 
Company placed EUR4.0 million in an escrow account pending the outcome of this appeal. In December 2008, 
the CFI annulled the Commission's decision against Charleroi Airport and Ryanair was repaid the EUR4.0 
million that the Commission had claimed was illegal state aid. A further action taken by the Belgian 
government for EUR2.3 million has also been withdrawn.
 Ryanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports, 
notably Lübeck, Berlin (Schönefeld), Tampere, Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Frankfurt (Hahn), Niederrhein (Weeze), 
Zweibrücken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, Vasteras, Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, Nimes, 
Angouleme, Marseille and Brussels (Charleroi). In January 2010, the European commission concluded the 
Bratislava state aid investigation with a finding that Ryanair's agreement with Bratislava airport 
involved no aid. The remaining nineteen investigations involving Ryanair are ongoing and Ryanair currently 
expects that they will conclude within the next 12 months, with any European Commission's decisions 
appealable to the EU General Court.
 State aid complaints by Lufthansa about Ryanair's cost base at Frankfurt (Hahn) have been rejected by 
German courts, as have similar complaints by Air Berlin in relation to Ryanair's arrangement with Lubeck 
airport, but following a German Supreme Court ruling on a procedural issue in early 2011, these cases will 
be re-heard by lower courts. In addition, Ryanair has been involved in legal challenges including 
allegations of state aid at Alghero and Marseille airports. The Alghero case (initiated by Air One) was 
dismissed in its entirety in April 2011. The Marseille case was withdrawn by the plaintiffs (subsidiaries 
of Air France) in May 2011.
 The Company has also entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in 
interest rates for certain floating-rate financing arrangements. Cash deposits have been set aside as 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -88-
collateral for the counterparty's exposure to risk of fluctuations on long-term derivative and other 
financing arrangements with Ryanair (restricted cash) (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 
for further details). Additional numerical information on these swaps and on other derivatives held by the 
Company is set out in Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

 that the tax will be abolished or indeed that a higher rate of tax will not be applied in the future, which could have a 
negative impact on demand for air travel. In June 2011, Ryanair proposed to the Irish Government that it would 
deliver an incremental 5 million passengers per annum over a five year period in return for reduced airport charges 
and the abolition of the EUR3 air travel tax. Despite the fact that this offer was renewed in 2012, as of July 19, 
2013, the Company has not yet received a positive response to this proposal. The Company is currently in 
negotiations with the DAA in relation to a growth incentive scheme whereby additional traffic will be delivered at

 The Greek government planned to introduce similar taxes; however, they have now cancelled plans to introduce 
these taxes. 
The German government introduced an EUR8 passenger tax on January 1, 2011 for all departing domestic or 
short-haul passengers and a passenger tax of EUR25 for all departing passengers on flights bound for southern 
Europe and northern Africa. The EUR8 tax was reduced to EUR7.50 in January 2012. In addition, the Austrian 
government introduced an ecological air travel levy of EUR8 effective January 1, 2011. In July 2013, the local 
Walloon Government in Belgium voted to introduce a EUR3 passenger travel tax from January 2014. Ryanair has 
threatened to cut its services at Charleroi Airport if the tax is introduced.
 In March 2007, the discount arrangement formerly in place at London (Stansted) airport terminated, subjecting 
Ryanair to an average increase in charges of approximately 100%. The increase in these charges, which was 
passed on in the form of higher ticket prices, had a negative impact on yields and passenger volumes in the winter, 
resulting in Ryanair's decision to ground seven aircraft. Ryanair responded to the increases by filing complaints with 
the U.K. Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") and the Competition Commission, calling for the break-up of the British 
Airports Authority plc ("BAA") monopoly and the introduction of competition in the London airports market. The OFT 
referred the matter to the Competition Commission, which found that the common ownership by BAA of the three 
main airports in London negatively affected competition and that a "light touch" approach to regulating BAA by the 
Civil Aviation Authority adversely impacted competition. In March 2009 the Competition Commission ordered the 
break-up of BAA. In October 2009, London (Gatwick) was sold to Global Infrastructure Partners for GBP1.5 billion. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -28-
Following a delay caused by various appeals by the BAA, the BAA proceeded to sell Edinburgh Airport in April 
2012, and Stansted airport to Manchester Airports Group plc in March 2013. Following the December 2003 
publication of the U.K. government's White Paper on Airport Capacity in the Southeast of England, the BAA in 2004 
announced plans to spend up to GBP4 billion on a multi-year project to construct a second runway and additional 
terminal facilities at London (Stansted) airport with a target opening date of 2013. Ryanair and other airlines using 
London (Stansted) support the principle of a second runway at London (Stansted), but are opposed to this 
development because they believe that the financing of what they consider to be an overblown project will lead to 
airport costs approximately doubling from current levels. In May 2010 the BAA announced that it would not proceed 
with this GBP4 billion program. In April 2013 the UK Civil Aviation Authority proposed that the regulatory regime for 
airport charges at Stansted Airport between 2014 and 2019 should operate on the basis that charges can grow 
annually at half the rate of inflation.  A final decision in this regard will be made by early 2014.
 Ryanair announced on July 21, 2009 that, as a result of the U.K. government's then GBP10 APD tourist tax (as 
well as the then scheduled increase in APD from GBP10 to GBP11, which occurred in November 2009, from 
GBP11 to GBP12 which occurred in November 2010 and from GBP12 to GBP13 in April 2012) and the high costs 
of operating at its London (Stansted) base, it would implement a 40% reduction in capacity at such base between 
October 2009 and March 2010. In particular, the Company announced its intention to reduce its London (Stansted)-
based aircraft from the then current 40 to 24 during the aforementioned period, and also reduce by 30% the number 
of weekly Ryanair flights to and from the airport. The Company announced at that time that it expected these cuts to 
result in 2.5 million fewer passenger trips during the period. In addition, on June 29, 2010, due to the continuance of 
the U.K. government's GBP11 APD tourist tax and high charges at London (Stansted) airport, the Company 
announced that capacity at London (Stansted) airport would be reduced from winter 2010 by 17% and the number 
of aircraft based at London (Stansted) would be reduced to 22. Ryanair also noted that, as a result of other capacity 
reductions at its U.K. bases except for the bases at Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford, its total U.K. capacity fell by 
16% in the period from November 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011. In the 2013 fiscal year capacity to/from the U.K. was 
flat on the prior year. Capacity was increased in Manchester following the conclusion of a base agreement. This 
increase was offset by reductions in capacity in London (Gatwick) and Edinburgh as a result of cost increases. The 
Company is currently in negotiations with Manchester Airports Group plc, the owners of London (Stansted), in 
relation to an expansion of capacity at London (Stansted) in return for significant airport charge reductions for the 
incremental passenger volumes delivered. See "Item 3. Risk Factors3/4Risks Related to the Company3/4Ryanair's 
Continued Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject to 
Increase." See also "Item 8. Financial Information3/4Other Financial Information3/4Legal Proceedings3/4EU State 
Aid-Related Proceedings" for information regarding legal proceedings in which Ryanair's economic arrangements 
with several publicly owned airports are being contested.
 FUEL
 The cost of jet fuel accounted for approximately 45% and 43% of Ryanair's total operating expenses in the fiscal 
years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively (in each case, this accounts for costs after giving effect to the 
Company's fuel hedging activities but excludes de-icing costs, which accounted for approximately 1% of total fuel 
costs in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012). The future availability and cost of jet fuel cannot 
be predicted with any degree of certainty, and Ryanair's low-fares policy limits its ability to pass on increased fuel 
costs to passengers through increased fares. Jet fuel prices are dependent on crude oil prices, which are quoted in 
U.S. dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the euro, Ryanair's fuel costs, expressed in euro, 
may increase even absent any increase in the U.S. dollar price of jet fuel. Ryanair has also entered into foreign 
currency forward contracts to hedge against some currency fluctuations. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative 
Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exposure and Hedging."
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a much more 
selective basis. As of July 26, 2013, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering 
approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 at prices equivalent to 
approximately $980 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 26, 2013, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 75% of its estimated requirements for the first half of the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2015 at prices equivalent to approximately $935 per metric ton, and had not entered into any jet

fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period. See "Item 3. Key Information-
Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's 
Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse Impact to the Company's Profitability" and "Item 11. Quantitative 
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Fuel Price Exposure and Hedging" for additional information on 
recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as well as certain associated risks. See 
also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2013 Compared with Fiscal Year 2012-
Fuel and Oil."
 INSURANCE
 Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or 
terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs related to the repair or replacement of a 
damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from service. In addition, an accident or incident 
could result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured passengers and others who experienced 
injury or property damage as a result of the accident or incident, including ground victims. Ryanair maintains 
aviation third-party liability insurance, passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, directors and 
officers liability insurance, aircraft insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts 
per occurrence consistent with industry standards. Ryanair believes its insurance coverage is adequate, although 
not comprehensive. There can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will not need to be increased, 
that insurance premiums will not increase

Since certain of the Ordinary Shares are held by brokers or other nominees, the number of direct record holders in 
the United States, which is reported above 62, may not be fully indicative of the number of direct beneficial owners 
in the United States, or of where the direct beneficial owners of such shares are resident.
 In order to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, beginning June 26, 2001, Ryanair 
Holdings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary 
Shares until further notice. Therefore, holders of Ordinary Shares cannot currently convert their Ordinary Shares 
into ADRs. The Depositary will however convert existing ADRs into Ordinary Shares at the request of the holders of 
such ADRs. The Company in 2002 implemented additional measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to 
purchase Ordinary Shares. As a result, non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary 
Shares. See "Item 10. Additional Information-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" for additional 
information.

All Ordinary Shares repurchased have been cancelled.
 The maximum price at which the Company may repurchase Ordinary Shares, in accordance with the listing rules of 
the Irish Stock Exchange and of the Financial Services Authority, is the higher of 5% above the average market 
value of the Company's Ordinary Shares for the five business days prior to the day of the repurchase and the price 
stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) of December 22 2003 (No. 2273/2003) (which is the 
higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the Irish Stock Exchange). The 
minimum price at which the Company may repurchase Ordinary Shares is their nominal value, currently 0.635 euro 
cent per share.
 At an extraordinary general meeting of Shareholders held on April 19, 2012, the Company obtained a new 
repurchase authority which enables the Company to repurchase the Company's ADRs which are traded on 
NASDAQ. The maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADRs can be repurchased 
is 5% above one-fifth of the average market value of the Company's ADRs as quoted on NASDAQ, for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents five Ordinary Shares). Any ADRs purchased 
will be converted to Ordinary Shares by the Company's brokers for subsequent repurchase and cancellation by the 
Company. . On June 5, 2013 the Company repurchased 2,018,800 ADRs equivalent to 10,094,000 ordinary shares 
at a price of EUR7.65 per ordinary share.
 As of June 30, 2013, the total number of options over Ordinary Shares outstanding under all of the Company's 
share option plans was 11,142,430, representing 0.8% of the Company's issued share capital at that date.
 Item 10. Additional Information
 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
 Ryanair Holdings' capital stock consists of Ordinary Shares, each having a par value of 0.635 euro cent. As of 
March 31, 2013, a total of 1,447,051,752 Ordinary Shares were outstanding. On February 26, 2007, Ryanair 
effected a 2-for-1 share split as a result of which each of its then existing Ordinary Shares, par value 1.27 euro cent, 
was split into two new Ordinary Shares, par value 0.635 euro cent. Each Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof 
to one vote in respect of any matter voted upon by Ryanair Holdings' shareholders.
 OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES FROM REGISTRANT OR SUBSIDIARIES
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -51-
 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders approved a stock option plan (referred to herein as "Option Plan 2000"), under 
which all employees and directors are eligible to receive options. Grants of options were permitted to take place at 
the close of any of the ten years beginning with fiscal year 2000 only if the Company's net profit after tax for such 
fiscal year had exceeded its net profit after tax for the prior fiscal year by at least 25%, or if an increase of 1% in net 
profit after tax for the relevant year would have resulted in such requirement being met.
 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders have also approved a stock option plan (referred to herein as "Option Plan 2003") 
established in accordance with a then tax-favorable share option scheme available under Irish law, so that 
employees would not be subject to income tax on the exercise of options (subject to certain conditions). Option Plan 
2003 was approved by the Revenue Commissioners on July 4, 2003 for the purposes of Chapter 4, Part 17, of the 
Irish Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 and Schedule 12C of that Act. Following the publication of the Irish National 
Recovery Plan: 2011-2014 (the "NRP") on November 24, 2010, Revenue approved share option plans, such as 
Option Plan 2003, no longer qualified for favorable tax treatment from that date. All employees and full-time 
directors were eligible to participate in the plan, under which grants of options could be made at the close of any of 
the ten years beginning with fiscal year 2002 only if the Company's net profit after tax for such fiscal year had 
exceeded its net profit after tax for the prior fiscal year by at least 25%, or if an increase of 1% in net profit after tax 
for the relevant year would have resulted in such requirement being met.
 Under Option Plan 2000, 20 senior managers (including seven of the current executive officers) were granted 
10,500,000 share options, in the aggregate, at a strike price of EUR3.21 in July 2005. Not all of the vesting 
conditions were met, and as a result only 80% of the options granted that satisfied the conditions were exercisable 
between August 1, 2011 and August 31, 2013.  The Company recognized a credit of EUR2.5 million in relation to 
the options that did not vest in June 2011. Also, under Option Plan 2000, each of the non-executive directors were 
granted 25,000 share options, at a strike price of EUR4.96, during the 2008 fiscal year. These options are 
exercisable between June 2012 and June 2014. In addition, 39 senior managers (including eight of the current 
executive officers) were granted 10,000,000 share options, in the aggregate, under Option Plan 2000, at a strike 
price of EUR2.56, on September 18, 2008. These options will become exercisable between September 18, 2013 
and September 17, 2015, but only for managers who continue to be employed by the Company through September 
18, 2013.
 The aggregate of 11,142,430 Ordinary Shares that would be issuable upon exercise in full of the options that were 
outstanding as of June 30, 2013 under Company's option plan represent approximately 0.8% of the issued share 
capital of Ryanair Holdings as of such date. Of such total, options in respect of an aggregate of 9,575,000 Ordinary 
Shares were held by the directors and executive officers of Ryanair Holdings. For further information, see notes 15 
and 19 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.

Body
 The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board. All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures 
are complied with.
 Membership
 The Board consists of one executive and nine non-executive directors. It is the practice of Ryanair that a majority of 
the Board comprises non-executive directors, considered by the Board to be independent, and that the Chairman is 
non-executive.  Significant new and relevant experience has been added in the period since the year ended March 
31, 2012 and the Board considers the current size, composition and diversity, of the Board to be within a range 
which is appropriate.  The composition of the Board and the principal Board Committees are set out in the table 
below. Brief biographies of the directors are set out on page 102. The Board, with the assistance of the Nomination 
Committee, keeps Board composition under review to ensure that it includes the necessary mix of relevant skills 
and experience required to perform its role.
 Each director has extensive business experience, which they bring to bear in governing the Company. The Board 
considers that, between them, the directors bring the range of skills, knowledge and experience, including 
international experience, necessary to lead the Company. The Company has a Chairman with an extensive 
background in this industry, and significant public company experience. Historically, the Company has always 
separated the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive for the running of the business and implementation of the 
Board's strategy and policy.

 Appointment
 Directors can only be appointed following selection by the Nomination Committee and approval by the Board 
and must be elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment. 
Ryanair's Articles of Association require that all of the directors retire and offer themselves for re-
election within a three-year period. One third (rounded down to the next whole number if it is a 
fractional number) of the directors (being the directors who have been longest in office) will retire by 
rotation and be eligible for re-election at every Annual General Meeting. Accordingly Charles McCreevy and 
Declan McKeon will be offering themselves for re-election at the AGM on September 20, 2013.  In addition 
Louise Phelan, Julie O'Neill and Dick Milliken will be offering themselves for election.
 In accordance with the recommendations of the 2010 Code, Declan McKeon is Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and James Osborne, the senior non-executive director, is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -5-
 Senior Management regularly briefs the Board including new members in relation to operating, financial 
and strategic issues concerning the Company. The Board also have direct access to senior management as 
required in relation to any issues they have concerning the operation of the Company. The terms and 
conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are set out in their letters of appointment, which 
are available for inspection at the Company's registered office during normal office hours and at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 Independence
 The Board has carried out its annual evaluation of the independence of each of its non-executive 
directors, taking account of the relevant provisions of the 2010 Code, namely, whether the directors are 
independent in character and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to 
affect, or could appear to affect, the directors' judgment. The Board regards all of the directors as 
independent and that no one individual or one grouping exerts an undue influence on others.
 The Board has considered Kyran McLaughlin's independence given his role as Deputy Chairman and Head of 
Capital Markets at Davy Stockbrokers. Davy Stockbrokers are one of Ryanair's corporate brokers and provide 
corporate advisory services to Ryanair from time to time. The Board has considered the fees paid to Davy 
Stockbrokers for these services and believe that they are immaterial to both Ryanair and Davy Stockbrokers 
given the size of each organisation's business operations and financial results. Having considered this 
relationship, the Board has concluded that Kyran McLaughlin continues to be an independent non-executive 
director within the spirit and meaning of the 2010 Code Rules.
 The Board has also considered the independence of David Bonderman given his shareholding in Ryanair 
Holdings plc. As at March 31, 2013, David Bonderman had a beneficial shareholding in the Company of 
9,230,671 ordinary shares, equivalent to 0.64% of the issued share capital. Having considered this 
shareholding in light of the number of issued shares in Ryanair Holdings plc and the financial interest of 
the director, the Board has concluded that the interest is not so material as to breach the spirit of the 
independence rule contained in the 2010 Code.
 The Board has further considered the independence of Messrs. David Bonderman, James Osborne,  Kyran 
McLaughlin and Michael Horgan as they have each served more than nine years on the Board. The Board 
considers that each of these directors is independent in character and judgment as each has other 
significant commercial and professional commitments and each brings his own level of senior experience 
gained in their fields of international business and professional practice. When arriving at this 
decision, the Board has taken into account the comments made by the FRC in their report dated December, 
2009 on their review of the impact and effectiveness of the 2010 Code, in particular their comment that 
independence is not the primary consideration when assessing the composition of the Board, and that the 
over-riding consideration should be that the Board is fit for purpose. For these reasons, and also because 
each director's independence is considered annually by the Board, the Board considers it appropriate that 
these directors have not been offered for annual re-election as is recommended by the 2010 Code.  The 
Nominations Committee have confirmed to the Board that they consider the directors offering themselves for 
re-election at the 2013 AGM to be independent and that they continue to effectively contribute to the work 
of the Board. The Nominations Committee recommends that the Company accept the re-election of the 
directors.
 Board Procedures
 All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and the Board has 
established a procedure whereby directors wishing to obtain advice in the furtherance of their duties may 
take independent professional advice at the Company's expense.

 Operating profit. As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit increased 33.0% on a per-passenger 
basis in the 2012 fiscal year, and also increased in absolute terms, from EUR488.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 
EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Ryanair Has Decided to 
Seasonally Ground Aircraft. The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results 
of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2012 and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on 
future operations. The Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company 
operated the grounded aircraft, would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these 
aircraft, due to significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any 
material staff costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be 
furloughed under the terms of their contract without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the 
grounded aircraft will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of 
depreciation and amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income increased 62.5%, from EUR27.2 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year to EUR44.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year reflecting the improved yield on term deposits.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges increased 16.3%, from EUR93.9 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year to EUR109.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year, primarily due to higher interest rates in the 2012 fiscal year 
compared to the 2011 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase as Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses.Ryanair recorded foreign exchange gains of EUR4.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year, 
as compared with foreign exchange losses of EUR0.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year, with the different result being 
primarily due to the weakening of the euro against the U.K. pound sterling during the 2012 fiscal year.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2012 fiscal year was 11.5%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 11.0% 
in the 2011 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR72.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR46.3 million in the 2011 fiscal year, with the increase primarily reflecting higher pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -39-
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.
 SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS
 The Company's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects 
these variations to continue. Among the factors causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to 
general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Ryanair typically records higher revenues and 
income in the first half of each fiscal year ended March 31 than the second half of such year.
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 Please see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for information on recently issued 
accounting standards that are material to the Company.
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 Liquidity. The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from 
operations and bank loans for the acquisition of aircraft. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Company-The Company Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and 
Capital Markets could Negatively Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain Financing on Acceptable Terms" for more 
information about risks relating to liquidity and capital resources. The Company had cash and liquid resources at 
March 31, 2013 and 2012 of EUR3,559.0 million and EUR3,515.6 million, respectively. The increase at March 31, 
2013 primarily reflects cash generated from operating activities of EUR1,023.5 million offset in part by the cash 
used to fund the payment of a EUR491.5 million dividend and the purchase of property, plant, and equipment - 
primarily 11 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, as well as the purchase of 15.0 million Ordinary Shares via a share buy-
back costing EUR67.5 million. During the 2013 fiscal year, the Company partially funded its EUR310.7 million in 
purchases of property, plant, and equipment out of EUR234.6 million in loans. Cash and liquid resources included 
EUR24.7 million and EUR35.1 million in "restricted cash" held on deposit as collateral for certain derivative financial 
instruments entered into by the Company with respect to its aircraft financing obligations and other banking 
arrangements at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. See "Item 8. Financial Information3/4Other Financial 
Information3/4Legal Proceedings."
 The Company's net cash inflows from operating activities in the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years amounted to 
EUR1,023.5 million and EUR1,020.3 million, respectively. The EUR3.2 million increase in net cash flows from 
operating activities for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was principally due to a number of factors including 
a EUR493.8 million increase in operating revenues, due to a combination of a 4.3% increase in average fares, a 
4.5% increase in booked passengers and a 20.1% increase in ancillary revenues, partially offset by a EUR291.0 
million, or 18.3%, increase in fuel and oil costs, due to the increase in the level of activity and increases in the 
average price of fuel, and a EUR146.4 million, or 8.1%, increase in non-fuel related operating expenses (excluding 
a EUR20.4 million, or 6.6%, increase in non-cash depreciation) due to the growth of the business.  In addition, 
movements in working capital, related principally to cash received in advance for flights, and receipt of other 
receivables and increases in other payables balances, generated EUR67.4 million in cash in 2013, compared with 
EUR101.8 million in 2012.  This decrease in net cash generated from working capital of EUR34.4 million, or 
approximately 34%, is primarily due to the timing of Easter, which led to lower future fly revenues at year end.
 During the last two fiscal years, Ryanair's primary cash requirements have been for operating expenses, additional 
aircraft, including advance payments in respect of new Boeing 737-800s and related flight equipment, payments on 
related indebtedness and payments of corporation tax, as well as share buy-backs of EUR192.1 million and the 
payment of a EUR491.5 million special dividend to shareholders. Cash generated from operations has been the 
principal source for these cash requirements, supplemented primarily by aircraft-related bank loans
 The Company's net cash inflows from operating activities in the 2012 and 2011 fiscal years amounted to 
EUR1,020.3 million and EUR786.3 million, respectively. The EUR234.0 million, or 29%, increase in net cash flows 
from operating activities for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was principally due to a number of factors 
including a EUR760.7 million increase in operating revenues, due to a combination of a 15.6% increase in average 
fares, a 5.2% increase in booked passengers and a 10.6% increase in ancillary revenues, partially offset by a 
EUR366.6 million, or 29.9%, increase in fuel and oil costs, due to the increase in the level of activity and increases 
in the average price of fuel, and a EUR167.6 million, or 10.2%, increase in non-fuel related operating expenses 
(excluding a EUR31.5 million, or 11.3%, increase in non-cash depreciation) due to the growth of the business.  In 
addition, movements in working capital, related principally to cash received in advance for flights, and receipt of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -39-
other receivables and increases in other payables balances, generated EUR101.8 million in cash in 2012, 
compared with EUR86.5 million in 2011.  This increase in net cash generated from working capital of EUR15.3 
million, or 17.7%, primarily related to an increase in cash receipts from advance bookings.
 The Company's net cash used in investing activities in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 totaled EUR1,821.5 million and 
EUR185.4 million, respectively, primarily reflecting the Company's capital expenditures, and increased investment 
of cash with maturities of greater than three months, as described in more detail below.
 The Company's net cash used in investing activities in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 totaled EUR185.4 million and 
EUR474.0 million, respectively, primarily reflecting the Company's capital expenditures, and decreased investment 
of cash with maturities of greater than three months.
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled EUR669.4 million in the 2013 fiscal year, largely reflecting the receipt 
of proceeds from long-term borrowings of EUR234.6 million in fiscal year 2013 and shares issued of EUR21.4 
million, offset in part by repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR366.4 million, the payment of a EUR491.5 
million dividend and shares purchased under a share buy-back program of EUR67.5 million. The Company 
experienced a net cash outflow from financing activities of EUR154.9 million in fiscal year 2012.  This was due to 
the receipt of proceeds from long term borrowings of EUR292.3 million being more than offset by repayments of 
long-term borrowings of EUR329.7 million and the expenditure of EUR124.6 million under the share buy-back 
program.

Body
 There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards adopted for the first time during 
the year ended March 31, 2013, which had a material impact on our financial position or results from operations.
 Basis of preparation
 These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro millions, the euro being the functional currency of 
the parent entity and the majority of the group companies. They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for 
derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale securities which are stated at fair value, and share-based 
payments, which are based on fair value determined as at the grant date of the relevant share options. Certain non-
current assets, when they are classified as held for sale, are stated at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to 
sell.
 Critical accounting policies
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and the results of such estimates form the 
basis of judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. A revision to an accounting estimate is recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if 
the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if these are also affected. 
Principal sources of estimation uncertainty have been set forth in the critical accounting policies section below. 
Actual results may differ from estimates.
 The Company believes that its critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's most 
difficult, subjective and complex judgements, are those described in this section. These critical accounting policies, 
the judgements and other uncertainties affecting application of these policies and the sensitivity of reported results 
to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered in reviewing the consolidated financial 
statements.
 Long-lived assets
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -63-
 As of March 31, 2013, Ryanair had EUR4.9billion of property, plant and equipment long-lived assets, virtually all of 
which consisted of aircraft. In accounting for long-lived assets, Ryanair must make estimates about the expected 
useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the 
fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate.
 In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of all of the Company's aircraft, and other 
data available in the marketplace. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be 
caused by changes to Ryanair's maintenance programme, changes in utilisation of the aircraft, changes to 
governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices for new and used aircraft of the same or 
similar types. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, 
adjusts these assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis, through 
depreciation expense.
 Ryanair periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment 
would include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an aircraft, a significant change in 
an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the aircraft. While the 
airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these factors from time to time, Ryanair has not yet been 
seriously impacted and continues to record positive cash flows from these long-lived assets. Consequently, Ryanair 
has not yet identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its 
long-lived assets and the general airline operating environment.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market value of 
new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft disposals during prior 
periods. Aircraft are depreciated over a useful life of 23 years from the date of manufacture to residual value.
 Heavy maintenance
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed, on acquisition, to its service potential, reflecting the 
maintenance condition of the engines and airframe.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return the aircraft 
in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the airframe, engines and life-
limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, maintenance, in the form of major airframe 
overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, is required to be performed during 
the period of the lease and upon return of the aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance 
costs and the costs associated with the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or 
loss over the lease term for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of 
the major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely correlates with 
the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and replenish aircraft held under 
operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the control of Ryanair.
 While Ryanair may, in very limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains fully liable to perform all of its 
contractual obligations under the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such sub-leasing.
 Both of these elements of accounting policies involve the use of estimates in determining the quantum of both the 
initial maintenance asset and/or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the respective periods over which 
such amounts are charged to income. In making such estimates, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, industry regulations and recommendations from Boeing; however, these estimates can be 
subject to revision, depending on a number of factors, such as the timing of the planned maintenance, the ultimate 
utilisation of the aircraft, changes to government regulations and increases or decreases in estimated costs. 
Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts its 
assumptions, which generally impact maintenance and depreciation expense in the income statement on a 
prospective basis.
 Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Ryanair Holdings plc and its subsidiary 
undertakings as of March 31, 2013. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Ryanair. Control exists when Ryanair has 
the power either directly or indirectly to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefit from its activities.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -63-
 All inter-company account balances and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions 
have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
 The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated 
income statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair 
values are attributed to the separable net assets acquired.
 Business combinations
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date 
on which control is transferred to the Company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
 Acquisitions on or after April 1, 2010
 For acquisitions on or after January 1, 2010, the Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair 
value of the consideration transferred, plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, 
less the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 Acquisitions between January 1, 2004 and April 1, 2010
 For acquisitions between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the 
acquisition over the Company's interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the acquiree.
 Acquisitions prior to January 1, 2004 (date of transition to IFRSs)
 As part of its transition to the IFRSs, the Company elected to restate only those business combinations that 
occurred on or after January 1, 2003. Prior to January 1, 2003, goodwill represented the amount recognised under 
the Company's previous accounting framework, Irish GAAP.
 Foreign currency translation
 Items included in the financial statements of each of the group entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the majority of the group entities.

Body
 In November 2008, Ryanair initiated proceedings in the CFI contesting the European Commission's refusal to grant 
Ryanair access to documents relating to the European Commission's state aid investigations at Hamburg (Lubeck), 
Tampere, Berlin (Schonefeld), Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Bratislava and Frankfurt (Hahn) airports. These cases were 
heard on July 7, 2010 and a judgment was issued in December 2010. The CFI found that the European 
Commission had acted in line with applicable legislation, which highlighted the unfairness inherent in state aid 
procedures in the EU, whereby alleged beneficiaries of aid have no right of access to the European Commission's 
files and therefore cannot properly exercise their rights to defense and good administration. The CFI ordered the 
European Commission to pay Ryanair's costs in three of the eight access to documents cases.
 As a result of rising airport charges and the introduction of an Air Travel Tax, in March 2009, of EUR10 on 
passengers departing from Irish airports on routes longer than 300 kilometers from Dublin Airport (EUR2 on shorter 
routes), Ryanair reduced its fleet at Dublin airport to 13 during winter 2010 (down from 22 in summer 2008 and 20 
in winter 2008). Ryanair also complained to the European Commission about the unlawful differentiation in the level 
of the Irish Air Travel tax between routes within the EU. From April 2011, a single rate (EUR3) of the Air Travel Tax 
has been introduced on all routes. In July 2012 the European Commission found that Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer 
Arann had received state aid from the Irish government by way of a two-tier air travel tax levied on passengers 
departing from Irish airports. Also in July 2012, Ryanair issued proceedings before the Irish courts seeking 
repayment of the entire amount of the air travel tax paid by Ryanair during the period (EUR87.8 million) where it 
was two-tier on the basis of its illegality. In April 2013 the Irish government issued proceedings against Ryanair 
seeking recovery of EUR12 million of alleged state aid attributable to Ryanair, arising from the European 
Commission decision. There is a risk that Ryanair will be ordered by the Irish courts to pay the EUR12 million 
amount to the Irish government notwithstanding our claim for repayment of the entire amount of the tax.
 Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company acquired 25.2% of Aer 
Lingus. The Company increased its interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and to 29.8% during the 2009 
fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of EUR407.2 million. Following the acquisition of its initial stake and upon the 
approval of the Company's shareholders, management proposed to effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by the European Commission on competition 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -47-
grounds. Ryanair filed an appeal with the CFI, which was heard in July 2009. On July 6, 2010 the Court upheld the 
European Commission's decision. (see also: "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Business 
Overview").
 The then EU Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, said on June 27, 2007 that, "Since Ryanair is not in a 
position to exert de jure or de facto control over Aer Lingus, the European Commission is not in a position to require 
Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding, which is, by the way, not a controlling stake." In October 2007, the 
European Commission also reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell its shares in Aer 
Lingus. However, Aer Lingus appealed this decision before the CFI. In January 2008, the CFI heard an application 
by Aer Lingus for interim measures limiting Ryanair's voting rights, pending a decision of the CFI on Aer Lingus' 
appeal of the European Commission's decision not to force Ryanair to sell the Aer Lingus shares. In March 2008, 
the court dismissed Aer Lingus' application for interim measures. Aer Lingus' main appeal was heard in July 2009. 
On July 6, 2010, the court rejected Aer Lingus' appeal and confirmed that Ryanair cannot be forced to dispose of its 
29.8% stake in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus chose not to appeal this judgment to the Court of Justice of the EU. EU 
legislation may change in the future to require such a forced disposal. If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in 
Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of 
such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
 On December 1, 2008, Ryanair made a second offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not 
own at a price of EUR1.40 per ordinary share. Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain 
the Aer Lingus brand, and retain its Heathrow slots and connectivity. Ryanair also proposed to double Aer Lingus' 
short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft and to create 1,000 associated new jobs over a five-year period. If the offer 
had been accepted, the Irish government would have received over EUR180 million in cash. The employee share 
ownership trust and employees who owned 18% of Aer Lingus would have received over EUR137 million in cash. 
The Company met Aer Lingus management, representatives of the employee share ownership trust and other 
parties. The offer of EUR1.40 per Aer Lingus share represented a premium of approximately 25% over the closing 
price of EUR1.12 on November 28, 2008. Ryanair also advised the market that it would not proceed to seek EU 
approval for the new bid unless the shareholders agreed to sell their stakes in Aer Lingus to Ryanair. However, as 
the Company was unable to secure the shareholders' support it decided, on January 28, 2009, to withdraw its 
second offer for Aer Lingus.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intended 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. Ryanair maintains that the OFT had and missed the opportunity to investigate Ryanair's minority stake 
within four months from the European Commission's June 2007 decision to prohibit Ryanair's takeover of Aer 
Lingus. The OFT agreed in October 2010 to suspend its investigation pending the outcome of Ryanair's appeal 
against the OFT's decision that its investigation is not time barred. On July 28, 2011, the Competition Appeal 
Tribunal ruled that the OFT was not time barred when it attempted in September 2010 to open an investigation into 
Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair subsequently appealed the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision.  On November 24, 2011, the UK Court of Appeal ordered a stay of the 
OFT's investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus pending the outcome of the appeal.  On May 22, 
2012, the UK Court of Appeal found that the OFT was not time barred to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer 
Lingus in September 2010. Ryanair subsequently sought permission to appeal this ruling to the UK Supreme Court 
but permission was refused.  On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in 
Aer Lingus to the UK Competition Commission
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair announced its third all cash offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it 
did not own at a price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share and immediately commenced pre-notification discussions with 
the European Commission for the purpose of preparing a merger filing.  Pending the outcome of the European 
Commission's review of Ryanair's bid, on the basis of the duty of "sincere cooperation" between the EU and the 
Member States, and under the EU Merger Regulation, the UK Competition Commission's investigation of Ryanair's 
minority stake in Aer Lingus should not have properly proceeded.  Nevertheless, Aer Lingus argued that the 
investigation should proceed and that Ryanair's offer was in breach of certain provisions of the UK Enterprise Act 
2002.
 On July 10, 2012, the Competition Commission ruled that Ryanair's bid was not in breach of the UK Enterprise Act, 
but nevertheless decided that its investigation of the minority stake can proceed in parallel with the European 
Commission's investigation of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus.  In July 2012, Ryanair appealed the latter part of the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -47-
Competition Commission's ruling to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal, and the Competition Commission's 
investigation became suspended pending the appeal process.  On August 8, 2012, the Competition Appeal Tribunal 
rejected Ryanair's appeal and found that the Competition Commission's investigation could proceed in parallel with 
the European Commission's investigation, but that the Competition Commission must avoid taking any final 
decision which could conflict with the European Commission's ultimate conclusion on Ryanair's bid.  In August 
2012, Ryanair appealed the Competition Appeal Tribunal judgment to the UK Court of Appeal.  In December 2012, 
the Court of Appeal rejected Ryanair's appeal and subsequently the Competition Commission's investigation has 
restarted.  On December 13, 2012, Ryanair applied to the UK Supreme Court for permission to appeal the judgment 
of the Court of Appeal.  The Supreme Court refused permission to appeal on April 25, 2013.
 On February 27, 2013 the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's bid to acquire the entire share capital of Aer 
Lingus on the claimed basis that it would be incompatible with the EU internal market.  Ryanair appealed this 
decision to the EU General Court on May 8, 2013. The judgment of the EU General Court is expected within 18-24 
months and may affirm or annul the decision of the European Commission.

 Ryanair's future growth also materially depends on its ability to access suitable airports located in its 
targeted geographic markets at costs that are consistent with Ryanair's ultra-low cost strategy. Any 
condition that denies, limits, or delays Ryanair's access to airports it serves or seeks to serve in the 
future would constrain Ryanair's ability to grow. A change in the terms of Ryanair's access to these 
facilities or any increase in the relevant charges paid by Ryanair as a result of the expiration or 
termination of such arrangements and Ryanair's failure to renegotiate comparable terms or rates could have 
a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For example in 
Spain, the Spanish government increased airport taxes at the two largest airports, Barcelona and Madrid, 
by over 100%, while smaller increases were implemented at other Spanish airports effective from July 1, 
2012. As a result, Ryanair cancelled routes and reduced capacity on remaining routes from Madrid and 
Barcelona in response to the Spanish government's decision to double airport taxes at the two airports.  
For additional information, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Airport Operations-Airport Charges." 
See also "-The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports."
 The Company's Acquisition of 29.8% of Aer Lingus and Subsequent Failure to Conclude a Complete 
Acquisition of Aer Lingus Could Expose the Company to Risk. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company 
acquired 25.2% of Aer Lingus. The Company increased its interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and 
to 29.8% during the 2009 fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of EUR407.2 million. Following the 
acquisition of its initial stake and upon the approval of the Company's shareholders, management proposed 
to effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, 
prohibited by the European Commission on competition grounds.
 In October 2007, the European Commission reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to 
sell its shares in Aer Lingus. This decision has been affirmed on appeal. However, EU legislation may 
change in the future to require such a forced disposition. If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in 
Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the 
forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it 
intends to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the 
OFT's investigation was time-barred. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's 
minority stake in Aer Lingus to the U.K. Competition Commission (the "Competition Commission").
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair announced its third all cash offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer 
Lingus it did not own at a price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share and immediately commenced pre-notification 
discussions with the European Commission for the purpose of preparing a merger filing.  Pending the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -18-
outcome of the European Commission's review of Ryanair's bid, on the basis of the duty of "sincere 
cooperation" between the EU and the Member States, and under the EU Merger Regulation, the UK Competition 
Commission's investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus should not have properly proceeded.  
Nevertheless, Aer Lingus argued that the investigation should proceed and that Ryanair's offer was in 
breach of certain provisions of the UK Enterprise Act 2002.
 On July 10, 2012, the Competition Commission ruled that Ryanair's bid was not in breach of the UK 
Enterprise Act, but nevertheless decided that its investigation of the minority stake can proceed in 
parallel with the European Commission's investigation of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus.  In July 2012, 
Ryanair appealed the latter part of the Competition Commission's ruling to the UK Competition Appeal 
Tribunal, and the Competition Commission's investigation became suspended pending the appeal process.  On 
August 8, 2012, the Competition Appeal Tribunal rejected Ryanair's appeal and found that the Competition 
Commission's investigation could proceed in parallel with the European Commission's investigation, but 
that the Competition Commission must avoid taking any final decision which could conflict with the 
European Commission's ultimate conclusion on Ryanair's bid.  In August 2012, Ryanair appealed the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal judgment to the UK Court of Appeal.  In December 2012, the Court of Appeal 
rejected Ryanair's appeal and subsequently the Competition Commission's investigation has restarted.  On 
December 13, 2012, Ryanair applied to the UK Supreme Court for permission to appeal the judgment of the 
Court of Appeal.  The Supreme Court refused permission to appeal on April 25, 2013.
 On February 27, 2013, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's bid to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus on the claimed basis that it would be incompatible with the EU internal market.  
Ryanair appealed this decision to the EU General Court on May 8, 2013. The judgment of the EU General 
Court is expected within 18-24 months and may affirm or annul the decision of the European Commission.
 Following the European Commission's decision to prohibit its offer for Aer Lingus, Ryanair has actively 
engaged with the UK Competition Commission's investigation of the minority stake. In its provisional 
findings on May 30, 2013, the UK Competition Commission (UKCC) stated that Ryanair, through its minority 
shareholding in Aer Lingus, "has  influence" over Aer Lingus, that this "could reduce competition", and 
that Ryanair should be required to divest some or all of its shares in Aer Lingus.  Following an extension 
of the investigation timetable on June 24, 2013, the UKCC's final decision will be published by September 
5, 2013.  The UKCC could order Ryanair to divest some or all of its shares in Aer Lingus, as a result of 
which Ryanair could suffer losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a 
significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares. Ryanair believes that the enforcement of any such decision 
should be delayed until the outcome of Ryanair's appeal against the European Commission's February 2013 
prohibition decision of Ryanair's 2012 offer for Aer Lingus, and the conclusion of any appeals against the 
UKCC's decision in the UK courts.  However, it is possible that the UKCC will seek to enforce any such 
sell-down remedy at an earlier date. On July 23, 2013 the Company announced that as part of its remedies 
discussions with the UKCC it had offered to give an undertaking to unconditionally sell its shareholding 
in Aer Lingus to any other EU airline that makes an offer for Aer Lingus and acquires acceptances in 
respect of more than 50% of Aer Lingus' issued share capital. For more information, see "Item 8. Financial 
Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus."
 Labor Relations Could Expose the Company to Risk. A variety of factors, including, but not limited to, 
Ryanair's profitability and its seasonal grounding policy, may make it difficult for Ryanair to avoid 
increases to salary levels and productivity payments. Consequently, there can be no assurance that 
Ryanair's existing employee compensation arrangements may not be subject to change or modification at any 
time. These steps may lead to deterioration in labor relations in Ryanair and could impact Ryanair's 
business or results. Ryanair also operates in certain jurisdictions with above average payroll taxes and 
employee-related social insurance costs, which could have an impact on the availability and cost of 
employees in these jurisdictions. Ryanair's crew in continental Europe operate on Irish contracts of 
employment on the basis that those crew work on Irish Territory, (i.e., on board Irish Registered 
Aircraft). A number of challenges have been initiated by government agencies in a number of countries to 
the applicability of Irish labor law to these contracts, and if Ryanair were forced to concede that Irish 
jurisdiction did not apply to those crew who operate from continental Europe then it could lead to 
increased salary, social insurance and pension costs and a potential loss of flexibility. In relation to 
social insurance costs, the European Parliament implemented amendments to Regulation (EC) 883/2004 which 
may impose substantial social insurance contribution increases for either or both Ryanair and the 
individual employees. While this change to social insurance contributions relates primarily to new 
employees, its effect in the long term may materially increase Company or employee social insurance 
contributions and could affect Ryanair's decision to operate from those high cost locations, resulting in 
redundancies and a consequent deterioration in labor relations.   For additional details see - "Change in 
EU Regulations in Relation to Employers and Employee Social Insurance could Increase Costs" below.

Body
 The directors and company secretary who held office at March 31, 2013 had no interests other than those 
outlined in Note 19 on page 188 of the consolidated financial statements in the shares of the Company or 
other group companies.
 Directors' and senior executives' remuneration
 The Company's policy on senior executive remuneration is to reward its executives competitively, having 
regard to the comparative marketplace in Ireland and the United Kingdom, in order to ensure that they are 
properly motivated to perform in the best interests of the shareholders. Details of total remuneration 
paid to senior key management (defined as the executive team reporting to the Board of Directors) is set 
out in Note 27 on page 199 of the consolidated financial statements.
 Executive director's service contract
 Ryanair entered into an employment agreement with its only executive director, Michael O'Leary on July 1, 
2002 for a one year period to June 30, 2003. Thereafter, the agreement continues for successive annual 
periods but may be terminated with 12 months notice by either party.  Mr. O'Leary is subject to a covenant 
not to compete with the Company within the EU for a period of one year after the termination of his 
employment with the Company. Michael O'Leary's employment agreement contains no provisions providing for 
compensation on its termination.
 Dividend policy
 Details of the Company's dividend policy are disclosed on page 118 of the Annual Report.
 Share buy-back
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5 
million.  This trade settled in early April 2012.  This is equivalent to approximately 1.0% of the 
Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share 
capital decreased by 15.0 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.1 million and the capital 
redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.1 million.  The capital redemption reserve is 
required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.  Further 
details are set out in the table on page 119 of the Annual Report.
 In June 2013 the Company bought back 24.1 million ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6 million,  
for cancellation.  Cumulatively these buybacks are equivalent to 1.7% of the issued share capital of the 
Company.

financial reporting and internal control issues. The Audit Committee, which consists exclusively of 
independent non-executive directors, meets at least quarterly to review the financial statements of the 
Company, to consider internal control procedures and to liaise with internal and external auditors. In the 
year ended March 31, 2013 the Audit Committee met on six occasions. On a quarterly basis the Audit 
Committee receives an extensive report from the internal auditor detailing the reviews performed in the 
year, and a risk assessment of the Company. This report is used by the Audit Committee and the Board of 
Directors, as a basis for determining the effectiveness of internal control.  The Audit Committee 
regularly considers the performance of internal audit and how best financial reporting and internal 
control principles should be applied.
 In addition, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing 
the work of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit 
services provided by the independent auditor.

Boeing in April, May and June 2013 in relation to the purchase of these aircraft.
 In June 2013 the Company bought back 24.1 million ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6 million,

 account the comments made by the Financial Reporting Council in its report dated December 2009 on its 
review of the impact and effectiveness of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The NASDAQ independence 
criteria specifically state that an individual may not be considered independent if, within the last three 
years, such individual or a member of his or her immediate family has had certain specified relationships 
with the company, its parent, any consolidated subsidiary, its internal or external auditors, or any 
company that has significant business relationships with the company, its parent or any consolidated 
subsidiary. Neither ownership of a significant amount of stock nor length of service on the board is a per

 On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Company's system of 
risk management and internal control for the year ended March 31, 2013 and has reported thereon to the 
Board.
 The Board has delegated to executive management the planning and implementation of the systems of 
internal control within an established framework which applies throughout the Company.
 Takeover Bids Directive
 Information regarding rights and obligations attached to shares are set forth in Note 15 on pages 183 to 
185 of the consolidated financial statements.
 Shares in the Ryanair employee share schemes carry no control rights and shares are only issued (and gain 
voting rights) when options are exercised by employees.
 Ryanair's Articles of Association do not contain any restrictions on voting rights. However, there are 
provisions in the Articles which allow the directors to (amongst other things) suspend the voting rights 
of a share if the Board believes the number of non-qualifying nationals holding shares in Ryanair would 
put it in breach of the Air Navigation Acts and licences and permits which allow it to operate. This is 
not an absolute restriction and can only occur if the Board designates a number of shares to be so 
restricted.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -9-
 Ryanair has not received any notifications from shareholders (as shareholders are obliged to do) 
regarding any agreements between shareholders which might result in restrictions on the transfer of 
shares.
 Details of the rules concerning the removal and appointment of the directors are set out above as part of 
this Directors' Report. There are no specific rules regarding the amendment of the Company's Articles of 
Association.
 Details of the Company's share buy-back programme are set forth on page 119 of the Annual Report. The 
shareholders approved the power of the Company to buy back shares at the 2006 AGM and at subsequent AGM's.
 None of the significant agreements to which the Company is party to, contain change of control 
provisions. As referred to above in this Director's Report, Michael O'Leary's employment agreement does 
not contain provisions providing for compensation on his termination.
 Going Concern
 After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The directors' responsibility for 
preparing the financial statements is explained on page 28 and the reporting responsibilities of the 
auditors are set out in their report on page 30.
 Compliance Statement
 Ryanair has complied, throughout the year ended March 31, 2013, with the provisions set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the requirements set out in the Irish Corporate Governance Annex except as 
outlined below. The Group has not complied with the following provisions of the 2010 Code, but continues 
to review these situations on an ongoing basis:
 --    A number of non-executive directors participate in the Company's share option plans. The 2010 Code 
requires that, if exceptionally, share options are granted to non-executive directors that shareholder 
approval should be sought in advance and any shares acquired by exercise of the options should be held 
until at least one year after the non-executive director leaves the board. In accordance with the 2010 
Code, the Company sought and received shareholder approval to make certain stock option grants to its non-
executive directors and as described above, the Board believes the quantum of options granted to non-
executive directors is not so significant to impair their independence.
 --    Certain non-executive directors, namely Messrs. David Bonderman, James Osborne, Kyran McLaughlin 
and Michael Horgan have each served more than nine years on the Board without being offered for annual re-
election. As described further above, given the other significant commercial and professional commitments 
of these non-executive directors, and taking into account that their independence is considered annually 
by the Board, the Board does not consider their independence to be impaired in this regard.
 On behalf of the Board

 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR569.3 million in the 2013 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR560.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year. This 1.6% increase was primarily 
attributable to an increase in revenues driven by a 4.3% increase in average fares and a 20.1% increase in ancillary 
revenues, partially offset by a 18.3% increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR1,593.6 million to EUR1.885.6 million. 
The result in fiscal 2012 included EUR57.8 million, net of tax, relating to a one off release of ticket sales revenue 
due to a change in accounting estimates arising in enhancements to Ryanair's revenue accounting system.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues increased 9.0%, from EUR3,504.0 million in the 
2012 fiscal year, to EUR3,819.8 million in the 2013 fiscal year, primarily reflecting an increase of 4.3% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 4.5%, from 75.8 million to 79.3 million, reflecting increased 
passenger volumes on existing routes and the successful launch of new bases at Chania, Eindhoven, Fez, Krakow, 
Maastricht, Marrakech and Zadar in the 2013 fiscal year.  Booked passenger load factors remained flat at 82% in 
both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013.
 Passenger capacity during the 2013 fiscal year increased by 4.7% due to the addition of 11 Boeing 737-800 aircraft 
(net of lease handbacks). Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 78.2 % of Ryanair's total revenues for the 
2013 fiscal year, compared with 79.8% of total revenues in the 2012 fiscal year.
 During fiscal year 2012, changes in estimates relating to the timing of revenue recognition for unused passenger 
tickets were made, resulting in increased revenue in the 2012 fiscal year of EUR65.3 million. This change reflects 
more accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.
 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 20.1%, from EUR886.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 
EUR1,064.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR13.43 
from EUR11.69. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage 
charges, administration/credit card fees, sales of rail and bus tickets, priority boarding, reserved seating, 
accommodation, travel insurance and car rental increased 23.3% to EUR796.2 million from EUR645.6 million in the 
2012 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight sales increased 2.8%, to EUR110.2 million from EUR107.2 million in the 
2012 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-related services, primarily commissions received from products sold on 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -36-
Ryanair.com or linked websites, increased 18.3%, from EUR133.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR157.8 
million in the 2013 fiscal year. The rate of increase in revenues from all ancillary revenue categories exceeded that 
of the increase in overall passengers booked.
 The following table sets forth the components of ancillary revenues earned by Ryanair and each component 
expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

Operating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses increased from 84.5% in the 
2012 fiscal year to 85.3% in the 2013 fiscal year, as total revenues increased by 11.2%, slower than the 12.4% 
increase in operating expenses. In absolute terms, total operating expenses increased 12.4%, from EUR3,707.0 
million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR4,165.8 million in the 2013 fiscal year, principally as a result of an 18.3% 
increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR1,885.6 million in the 2013 
fiscal year. Staff costs, depreciation and amortization, aircraft rental expenses, route charges, airport handling 
charges and marketing, distribution and other costs decreased as a percentage of total revenues, while 
maintenance and fuel and oil expenses increased. Total operating expenses per passenger increased by 7.5%, 
with the increase reflecting, principally, the increase in passenger capacity during the 2013 fiscal year and the 
impact of the higher fuel costs.
 The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results of the Company for the 
year ended March 31, 2013 and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on future operations. The 
Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company operated the 
grounded aircraft would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these aircraft, due to 
significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any material staff 
costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be furloughed under 
the terms of their contracts without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the grounded aircraft 
will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of depreciation and 
amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.
 The following table sets forth the amounts in euro cent of, and percentage changes in, Ryanair's operating 
expenses (on a per-passenger basis) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012 under IFRS. 
These data are calculated by dividing the relevant expense amount (as shown in the consolidated financial 
statements) by the number of booked passengers in the relevant year as shown in the table of "Selected Operating 
and Other Data" in Item 3 and rounding to the nearest euro cent; the percentage change is calculated on the basis 
of the relevant figures before rounding.

Staff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, increased 0.4% on a per-
passenger basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 5.0%, from EUR415.0 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR435.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a 3.7% 
increase in hours flown and a flight crew pay increase of 2% granted in fiscal 2013.

(c)           Share options and share purchase arrangements
 The Company has adopted a number of share option plans, which allow current or future employees or 
executive directors to purchase shares in the Company up to an aggregate of approximately 5% (when 
aggregated with other ordinary shares over which options are granted and which have not yet been 
exercised) of the outstanding ordinary shares of Ryanair Holdings plc, subject to certain conditions. All 
grants are subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee. These are exercisable at a price equal to 
the market price of the ordinary shares at the time options are granted. The key terms of these option 
plans include the requirement that certain employees remain in employment with the Company for a specified 
period of time and that the Company achieves certain Net Profit targets. These share options schemes are 
cash settled.

The Company has accounted for its share option grants to employees at fair value, in accordance with IFRS 
2, using a binomial lattice model to value the option grants. This has resulted in a charge of EUR1.9 
million to the income statement (2012: EUR0.7 million credit; 2011: EUR3.3 million charge) being 
recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
 There were no share options granted during the years ended March 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.

million (2012: EUR70.0 million; 2011: EUR34.3 million). The total cash-flow hedge reserve amounted to 
EUR0.5 million at March 31, 2013 (2012: EUR138.6 million; 2011: EUR257.4 million). Further details of the 
group's derivatives are set out in Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

Body
 The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Articles of Association of Ryanair Holdings. This 
summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text 
of the Articles, which are included as an exhibit to this annual report.
 Objects. Ryanair Holdings' objects, which are detailed in its Articles, are broad and include carrying on 
business as an investment and holding company. Ryanair Holdings' Irish company registration number is 
249885.
 Directors. Subject to certain exceptions, directors may not vote on matters in which they have a material 
interest. The ordinary remuneration of the directors is determined from time to time by ordinary 
resolutions of the shareholders. Any director who holds any executive office, serves on any committee or 
otherwise performs services, which, in the opinion of the directors, are outside the scope of the ordinary 
duties of a director, may be paid such extra remuneration as the directors may determine. The directors 
may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money. These powers may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders. The directors are not required to retire at any particular age. There is 
no requirement for directors to hold shares. One-third of the directors retire and offer themselves for 
re-election at each annual general meeting of the Company. The directors to retire by rotation are those 
who have been longest in office since their last appointment or reappointment. As between persons who 
became or were appointed directors on the same date, those to retire are determined by agreement between 
them or, otherwise, by lot. All of the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the annual general 
meeting of the Company may vote on the re-election of directors.
 Annual and General Meetings. Annual and extraordinary meetings are called upon 21 days' advance notice. 
At Ryanair's annual general meeting, held on September 22, 2010, the Company's Articles of Association 
were amended by special resolution to reflect the implementation of the Shareholders' Rights (Directive 
2007/36/EC) Regulations 2009 to allow all Ryanair shareholders to appoint proxies electronically to 
attend, speak, ask questions and vote on behalf of them at annual general meetings and to reflect certain 
other provisions of those Regulations. All holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend, speak at and 
vote at general meetings of the Company, subject to limitations described below under "-Limitations on the 
Right to Own Shares."
 Rights, Preferences and Dividends Attaching to Shares. The Company has only one class of shares, Ordinary 
Shares with a par value of 0.635 euro cent per share. All such shares rank equally with respect to payment 
of dividends and on any winding-up of the Company. Any dividend, interest or other sum payable to a 
shareholder that remains unclaimed for one year after having been declared may be invested by the 
directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. If the directors so resolve, any dividend which 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -52-
has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date of its declaration shall be forfeited and cease to 
remain owing by the Company. The Company is permitted under its Articles to issue redeemable shares on 
such terms and in such manner as the Company may, by special resolution, determine. The Ordinary Shares 
currently in issue are not redeemable. The liability of shareholders to invest additional capital is 
limited to the amounts remaining unpaid on the shares held by them. There are no sinking fund provisions 
in the Articles of the Company.
 Action Necessary to Change the Rights of Shareholders. The rights attaching to shares in the Company may 
be varied by special resolutions passed at meetings of the shareholders of the Company.
 Limitations on the Rights to Own Shares. The Articles contain detailed provisions enabling the directors 
of the Company to limit the number of shares in which non-EU nationals have an interest or the exercise by 
non-EU nationals of rights attaching to shares. See "-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" 
below. Such powers may be exercised by the directors if they are of the view that any license, consent, 
permit or privilege of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that enables it to operate an air service 
may be refused, withheld, suspended or revoked or have conditions attached to it that inhibit its exercise 
and the exercise of the powers referred to above could prevent such an occurrence. The exercise of such 
powers could result in non-EU holders of shares being prevented from attending, speaking at or voting at 
general meetings of the Company and/or being required to dispose of shares held by them to EU nationals.
 Disclosure of Share Ownership. Under Irish law, the Company can require parties to disclose their 
interests in shares. The Articles of the Company entitle the directors to require parties to complete 
declarations indicating their nationality and the nature and extent of any interest which such parties 
hold in Ordinary Shares before allowing such parties to transfer such Ordinary Shares. See, also "-
Limitations on Share Ownership by non-EU nationals" below. Under Irish law, if a party acquires or 
disposes of Ordinary Shares so as to bring his interest above or below 5% of the total issued share 
capital of the Company, he must notify the Company of that. The Irish Stock Exchange must also be notified 
of any acquisition or disposal of shares that brings the shareholding of a party above or below certain 
specified percentages - i.e., 10%, 25%, 50% and 75%.
 Other Provisions of the Articles of Association. There are no provisions in the Articles:
 (i)    delaying or prohibiting a change in the control of the Company, but which operate only with 
respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring;
 (ii)   discriminating against any existing or prospective holder of shares as a result of such 
shareholder owning a substantial number of shares; or
 (iii)  governing changes in capital,
 in each case, where such provisions are more stringent than those required by law.
 MATERIAL CONTRACTS
 On March 19, 2013 the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase 175 
Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, with a list value of over $14.2 billion, over a five year period from fiscal 
2015 to 2019 in accordance with the terms of the contract. The contract was approved by the shareholders 
of the Company at an extraordinary general meeting on June 18, 2013.
 EXCHANGE CONTROLS
 Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish 
securities (including shares or depositary receipts of Irish companies such as the Company). Dividends and 
redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities.
 Under the Financial Transfers Act 1992 (the "1992 Act"), the Minister for Finance of Ireland may make 
provision for the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. Financial 
transfers are broadly defined, and the acquisition or disposal of the ADRs, which represent shares issued 
by an Irish incorporated company, the acquisition or the disposal of Ordinary Shares and associated 
payments may fall within this definition. Dividends or payments on the redemption or purchase of shares 
and payments on the liquidation of an Irish-incorporated company would fall within this definition.
 The 1992 Act prohibits financial transfers involving the late Slobodan Milosevic and associated persons, 
Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), certain persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia, the now deceased Usama Bin Laden, the Al-Qaeda network and the Taliban of Afghanistan, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, the Republic of Guinea, the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (North Korea), Iran, Iraq, Côte d'Ivoire, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Afghanistan, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, 
Sudan, Somalia, Syria, certain known terrorists and terrorist groups, and countries that harbor certain 
terrorist groups, without the prior permission of the Central Bank of Ireland.
 Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, an ADS involving the government of any country that is 
currently the subject of United Nations sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, 
or any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions 
as implemented into Irish law. The Company does not anticipate that Irish exchange controls or orders 
under the 1992 Act or United Nations sanctions implemented into Irish law will have a material effect on 
its business.
 LIMITATIONS ON SHARE OWNERSHIP BY NON-EU NATIONALS
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -52-
 The Board of Directors of Ryanair Holdings is given certain powers under the Articles to take action to 
ensure that the number of Ordinary Shares held in Ryanair Holdings by non-EU nationals does not reach a 
level which could jeopardize the Company's entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any 
license, permit, consent or privilege which it holds or enjoys and which enables it to carry on business 
as an air carrier (a "License"). In particular, EU Regulation 2407/92 requires that, in order to obtain 
and retain an operating license, an EU air carrier must be majority-owned and effectively controlled by EU 
nationals. The regulation does not specify what level of share ownership will confer effective control on 
a holder or holders of shares. As described below, the directors will, from time to time, set a "Permitted 
Maximum" on the number of Ordinary Shares that may be owned by non-EU nationals at such level as they 
believe will comply with EU law. The Permitted Maximum is currently set at 49.9%.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -79-
At March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognised all required deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
There are no taxable temporary differences arising in overseas subsidiaries and, on that basis, no 
deferred tax has been provided for on the un-remitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries because there is 
no intention to remit these to Ireland.

 (i)             Ryanair does not have any representation on the Aer Lingus Board of Directors, nor does 
it have a right to appoint a director;
 (ii)           Ryanair does not participate in Aer Lingus' policy-making decisions, nor does it have a 
right to participate in such policy-making decisions;
 (iii)          There are no material transactions between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, there is no interchange 
of personnel between the two companies and there is no sharing of technical information between the 
companies;
 (iv)          Aer Lingus and its significant shareholder (the Irish government: 25.1%) have openly 
opposed Ryanair's investment or participation in the company;
 (v)           In August 2007, September 2007 and November/December 2011, Aer Lingus refused Ryanair's 
attempt to assert its statutory right to requisition a general meeting (a legal right of any 10% 
shareholder under Irish law).
 (vi)          On April 15, 2011, the High Court in Dublin ruled that Aer Lingus was not obliged to accede 
to Ryanair's request that two additional resolutions (on the payment of a dividend and on payments to 
pension schemes) be put to vote at Aer Lingus' annual general meeting;
 (vii)         The European Commission has formally found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus does 
not grant Ryanair "de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus" and that "Ryanair's rights as a minority 
shareholder are associated exclusively to rights related to the protection of minority shareholders" 
(Commission Decision Case No. COMP/M.4439 dated October 11, 2007). The European Commission's finding has 
been confirmed by the European Union's General Court which issued a decision on July 6, 2010 that the 
European Commission was justified to use the required legal and factual standard in its refusal to order 
Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding in Aer Lingus and that, as part of that decision, Ryanair's 
shareholding did not confer control of Aer Lingus (Judgment of the General Court (Third Chamber) Case No. 
T-411/07 dated July 6, 2010); and
 (viii) On February 27, 2013 the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's bid made on June 19,  2012, to 
acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus on the claimed basis that it would be incompatible with the 
EU internal market.  Ryanair appealed this decision to the EU General Court on May 8, 2013. The judgment 
of the EU General Court is expected within 18-24 months and may affirm or annul the decision of the 
European Commission.
 Following the European Commission's decision to prohibit its offer for Aer Lingus, Ryanair has actively 
engaged with the Competition Commission's investigation of the minority stake. In its provisional findings 
on May 30, 2013, the UK Competition Commission (UKCC) stated that Ryanair, through its minority 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -68-
shareholding in Aer Lingus, "has  influence" over Aer Lingus, that this "could reduce competition", and 
that Ryanair should be required to divest some or all of its shares in Aer Lingus.  Following an extension 
of the investigation timetable on June 24, 2013, the UKCC's final decision will be published by September 
5, 2013.  The UKCC could order Ryanair to divest some or all of its shares in Aer Lingus, as a result of 
which Ryanair could suffer losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a 
significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares. Ryanair believes that the enforcement of any such decision 
should be delayed until the outcome of Ryanair's appeal against the European Commission's February 2013 
prohibition decision of Ryanair's 2012 offer for Aer Lingus, and the conclusion of any appeals against the 
UKCC's decision in the UK courts.  However, it is possible that the UKCC will seek to enforce any such 
sell-down remedy at an earlier date.   On July 23, 2013 the Company announced that as part of its remedies 
discussions with the UKCC it had offered to give an undertaking to unconditionally sell its shareholding 
in Aer Lingus to any other EU airline that makes an offer for Aer Lingus and acquires acceptances in 
respect of more than 50% of Aer Lingus' issued share capital.
 5              Derivative financial instruments
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for monitoring the treasury policies and 
objectives of the Company, which include controls over the procedures used to manage the main financial 
risks arising from the Company's operations. Such risks comprise commodity price, foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks. The Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks. 
These instruments include borrowings, cash deposits and derivatives (principally jet fuel derivatives, 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts). It is the 
Company's policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments takes place.
 The Company's historical fuel risk management policy has been to hedge between 70% and 90% of the 
forecast rolling annual volumes required to ensure that the future cost per gallon of fuel is locked in. 
This policy was adopted to prevent the Company being exposed, in the short term, to adverse movements in 
global jet fuel prices. However, when deemed to be in the best interests of the Company, it may deviate 
from this policy. At March 31, 2013, the Company had hedged approximately 90% of its estimated fuel 
exposure for the year ending March 31, 2014.  At March 31, 2012, the Company had hedged approximately 90% 
of its estimated fuel exposure for the year ending March 31, 2013. At March 31, 2011, the Company had 
hedged approximately 77% of its estimated fuel exposure for the year ending March 31, 2012.
 Foreign currency risk in relation to the Company's trading operations largely arises in relation to non-
euro currencies. These currencies are primarily U.K. pounds sterling and the U.S. dollar. The Company 
manages this risk by matching U.K. pounds sterling revenues against U.K. pounds sterling costs. Surplus 
U.K. pounds sterling revenues are sometimes used to fund forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge U.S. 
dollar currency exposures that arise in relation to fuel, maintenance, aviation insurance, and capital 
expenditure costs and excess U.K. pounds sterling are converted into euro. Additionally, the Company swaps 
euro for U.S. dollars using forward currency contracts to cover any expected U.S. dollar outflows for 
these costs. From time to time, the Company also swaps euro for U.K. pounds sterling using forward 
currency contracts to hedge expected future surplus U.K. pounds sterling. From time to time the Company 
also enters into cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rates and interest rates in respect of U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.
 The Company's objective for interest rate risk management is to reduce interest-rate risk through a 
combination of financial instruments, which lock in interest rates on debt and by matching a proportion of 
floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities. In addition, the Company aims to achieve the best 
available return on investments of surplus cash - subject to credit risk and liquidity constraints. Credit 
risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty based on 
third-party market-based ratings. In line with the above interest rate risk management strategy, the 
Company has entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates 
for certain floating rate financial arrangements and certain other obligations. The Company has also 
entered into floating rate financing for certain aircraft, which is matched with floating rate deposits. 
Additionally, certain cash deposits have been set aside as collateral for the counterparty's exposure to 
risk of fluctuations on certain derivative and other financing arrangements with Ryanair (restricted 
cash). At March 31, 2013, such restricted cash amounted to EUR24.7 million (2012: EUR35.1 million; 2011: 
EUR42.9 million). Additional numerical information on these swaps and on other derivatives held by the 
Company is set out below and in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
 The Company utilises a range of derivatives designed to mitigate these risks. All of the above 
derivatives have been accounted for at fair value in the Company's balance sheet and have been utilised to 
hedge against these particular risks arising in the normal course of the Company's business. All have been 
designated as hedging derivatives for the purposes of IAS 39 and are fully set out below.
 Derivative financial instruments, all of which have been recognised at fair value in the Company's 
balance sheet, are analysed as follows:

 Audit Committee. The Board of Directors established the Audit Committee in September 1996 to make 
recommendations concerning the engagement of independent chartered accountants; to review with the 
accountants the plans for and scope of each annual audit, the audit procedures to be utilized and the 
results of the audit; to approve the professional services provided by the accountants; to review the 
independence of the accountants; and to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal 
accounting controls. Messrs. McKeon, Osborne and McCreevy are the members of the Audit Committee. In 
accordance with the recommendations of the Irish Combined Code of Corporate Governance (the "Combined 
Code"), a senior independent non-executive director, Mr. McKeon, is the chairman of the Audit Committee. 
All members of the Audit Committee are independent for purposes of the listing rules of the NASDAQ and the 
U.S. federal securities laws.
 Nomination Committee. The Board of Directors established the Nomination Committee in May 1999 to make 
recommendations and proposals to the full Board of Directors concerning the selection of individuals to 
serve as executive and non-executive directors. The Board of Directors as a whole then makes appropriate 
determinations regarding such matters after considering such recommendations and proposals. Messrs. 
Bonderman, McLaughlin and O'Leary are the members of the Nomination Committee.
 Air Safety Committee. The Board of Directors established the Air Safety Committee in March 1997 to review 
and discuss air safety and related issues. The Air Safety Committee reports to the full Board of Directors 
each quarter. The Air Safety Committee is composed of Mr. Horgan (who acts as the chairman), as well as 
the following executive officers of Ryanair: Messrs. Conway, Hickey, O'Brien and Wilson.
 Powers of, and Action by, the Board of Directors
 The Board of Directors is empowered by the Articles to carry on the business of Ryanair Holdings, subject 
to the Articles, provisions of general law and the right of stockholders to give directions to the 
directors by way of ordinary resolutions. Every director who is present at a meeting of the Board of 
Directors of Ryanair Holdings has one vote. In the case of a tie on a vote, the chairman of the Board of 
Directors has a second or tie-breaking vote. A director may designate an alternate director to attend any 
Board of Directors meeting, and such alternate director shall have all the rights of a director at such 
meeting.
 The quorum for a meeting of the Board of Directors, unless another number is fixed by the directors, 
consists of three directors, a majority of whom must be EU nationals. The Articles require the vote of a 
majority of the directors (or alternates) present at a duly convened meeting for the approval of any 
action by the Board of Directors.
 Composition and Term of Office
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -43-
 The Articles provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of no fewer than three and no more than 15 
directors, unless otherwise determined by the stockholders. There is no maximum age for a director and no 
director is required to own any shares of Ryanair Holdings.
 Directors are elected (or have their appointments confirmed) at the annual general meetings of 
stockholders. Save in certain circumstances, at every annual general meeting, one-third (rounded down to 
the next whole number if it is a fractional number) of the directors (being the directors who have been 
longest in office) must stand for re-election as their terms expire. Accordingly the terms of Charles 
McCreevy and Declan McKeon will have expired and they will be eligible to offer themselves for re-election 
at the next annual general meeting of Ryanair. In addition, Julie O'Neill and Louise Phelan, who were 
newly appointed to the board on December 13, 2012, and Dick Milliken, who was appointed to the Board on 
July 26, 2013, will also offer themselves for re-appointment at the next annual general meeting, which is 
scheduled to be held on September 20, 2013.
 Exemptions from NASDAQ Corporate Governance Rules
 The Company relies on certain exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance rules. These exemptions, 
and the practices the Company adheres to, are as follows:
 The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's quorum requirements applicable to meetings of shareholders, which 
require a minimum quorum of 33% for any meeting of the holders of common stock, which in the Company's 
case are its Ordinary Shares. In keeping with Irish generally accepted business practice, the Articles 
provide for a quorum for general meetings of shareholders of three shareholders, regardless of the level 
of their aggregate share ownership.
 --      The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's requirement with respect to audit committee approval of 
related-party transactions, as well as its requirement that shareholders approve certain stock or asset 
purchases when a director, officer or substantial shareholder has an interest. The Company is subject to 
extensive provisions under the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange (the "Irish Listing Rules") 
governing transactions with related parties, as defined therein, and the Irish Companies Act also 
restricts the extent to which Irish companies may enter into related-party transactions. In addition, the 
Articles contain provisions regarding disclosure of interests by the directors and restrictions on their 
votes in circumstances involving conflicts of interest. The concept of a related party for purposes of 
NASDAQ's audit committee and shareholder approval rules differs in certain respects from the definition of 
a transaction with a related party under the Irish Listing Rules.
 --      NASDAQ requires shareholder approval for certain transactions involving the sale or issuance by a 
listed company of common stock other than in a public offering. Under the NASDAQ rules, whether 
shareholder approval is required for such transactions depends, among other things, on the number of 
shares to be issued or sold in connection with a transaction, while the Irish Listing Rules require 
shareholder approval when the size of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed 
company undertaking the transaction.
 --      NASDAQ requires that each issuer solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of 
shareholders and provide copies of such proxy solicitation to NASDAQ. The Company is exempt from this 
requirement as the solicitation of holders of ADSs is not required under the Irish Listing Rules or the 
Irish Companies Acts. Details of our annual general meetings and other shareholder meetings, together with 
the requirements for admission, voting or the appointment of a proxy are available on the website of the 
Company in accordance with the Irish Companies Acts and the Company's Articles of Association. ADS holders 
may provide instructions to The Bank of New York, as depositary, as to the voting of the underlying 
Ordinary Shares represented by such ADSs. Alternatively, ADS holders may convert their holding to Ordinary 
Shares, subject to compliance with the nationality ownership rules, in order to be eligible to attend our 
annual general meetings or other shareholder meetings.
 --      NASDAQ requires that all members of a listed company's Nominating Committee be independent 
directors, unless the Company, as a foreign private issuer, provides an attestation of non-conforming 
practice based upon home country practice and then discloses such non-conforming practice annually in its 
Form 20-F.  As permitted by the Irish Listing Rules, Michael O'Leary, the Company's Chief Executive 
Officer, serves as a member of the Company's Nominating Committee.
 The Company also follows certain other practices under the UK Corporate Governance Code in lieu of those 
set forth in the NASDAQ corporate governance rules, as expressly permitted thereby. Most significantly:
 --      Independence. NASDAQ requires that a majority of an issuer's Board of Directors be "independent" 
under the standards set forth in the NASDAQ rules and that directors deemed independent be identified in 
the Company's annual report on Form 20-F. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the Company's 
nine non-executive directors is "independent" under the standards set forth in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, there is no bright-line test establishing set criteria for 
independence, as there is under NASDAQ Rule 4200(a) (15). Instead, the Board of Directors determines 
whether the director is "independent in character and judgment," and whether there are relationships or 
circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director's judgment. Under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors may determine that a director is independent 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -43-
notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances which may appear relevant to its 
determination, but it should state its reasons if it makes such a determination. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code specifies that relationships or circumstances that may be relevant include whether the 
director: (i) has been an employee of the relevant company or group within the last five years; (ii) has 
had within the last three years a direct or indirect material business relationship with such company; 
(iii) has received payments from such company, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) has close family ties 
with any of the company's advisers, directors or senior employees; (v) holds cross-directorships or other 
significant links with other directors; (vi) represents a significant shareholder; or (vii) has served on 
the Board of Directors for more than nine years. In determining that each of the nine non-executive 
directors is independent under the UK Corporate Governance Code standard, the Ryanair Holdings Board of 
Directors identified such relevant factors with respect to non-executive directors Messrs. Bonderman, 
McLaughlin, Osborne and Horgan. When arriving at the decision that these directors are nonetheless 
independent, the Board of Directors has taken into

 Item 3. Key Information
 THE COMPANY
 Ryanair operates an ultra-low cost, scheduled airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes largely 
in Europe from its 57 bases in airports across Europe, which together are referred to as "Ryanair's bases 
of operations" or "Ryanair's bases."  For a list of these bases, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Route System, Scheduling and Fares."  Ryanair pioneered the low-fares operating model in Europe in the 
early 1990s. As of June 30, 2013, the Company offered over 1,600 scheduled short-haul flights per day 
serving approximately 180 airports largely throughout Europe, with an operating fleet of 303 aircraft 
flying approximately 1,600 routes. The Company also holds a 29.8% interest in Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer 
Lingus"), which it has acquired through market purchases following Aer Lingus' partial privatization in 
2006. Ryanair's attempts to acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus have been blocked by the 
European authorities, with the latest ruling currently under appeal by Ryanair.  For additional 
information, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Matters 
Related to Investment in Aer Lingus." A detailed description of the Company's business can be found in 
"Item 4. Information on the Company."

 Increased Costs for Possible Future ADR and Share Repurchases. In April 2012, the Company held an 
extraordinary general meeting ("EGM") to authorize the directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares and ADRs for up 
to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ").  Up until April 
2012, shareholders had only authorized the directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares. As the ADRs typically trade at 
a premium of 15% to 20% compared to Ordinary Shares, this may result in increased costs in performing share 
buy-backs in the future. In June 2013, the Company bought back 2,018,800 ADRs for cancellation. On June 20, 
2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders over the next two years with at least 
EUR400.0 million (EUR176.6 million already completed in June 2013) in share buybacks to be completed in the 
fiscal year to March 31, 2014 and up to a further EUR600.0 million in either special dividends or share buybacks. 
However, there can be no assurance that the EUR1 billion will be returned to shareholders, in whole or in part, as it 
is subject to shareholder approval, continuing profitability, the economic environment, capital expenditure and other 
commitments. At this time the Company has not decided whether it will conduct these further share repurchases in 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs or a combination of both.
 Item 4. Information on the Company
 INTRODUCTION
 Ryanair Holdings was incorporated in 1996 as a holding company for Ryanair Limited. The latter operates an ultra-
low cost, scheduled-passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, the U.K., 
Continental Europe, and Morocco. Incorporated in 1984, Ryanair Limited began to introduce a low-fares operating 
model under a new management team in the early 1990s. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects3/4History." As of June 30, 2013, with its operating fleet of 303 Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, 
Ryanair Limited offered over 1,600 scheduled short-haul flights per day serving approximately 180 airports largely 
throughout Europe. See "3/4Route System, Scheduling and Fares3/4Route System and Scheduling" for more 
details of Ryanair's route network. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects3/4Seasonal 
Fluctuations" for information about the seasonality of Ryanair's business.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -23-
 Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR569.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year, as 
compared to a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR560.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year. This 1.6% 
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues of approximately 11% from EUR4,390.2 million to 
EUR4,884.0 million, partially offset by an increase in fuel costs of approximately 18% from EUR1,593.6 million to 
EUR1,885.6 million. Ryanair generated an average booked passenger load factor of approximately 82%, the same 
as in fiscal 2012, and average booked passenger fare of EUR48.20 per passenger in the 2013 fiscal year, up from 
EUR45.36 in the prior fiscal year. The Company has focused on maintaining low operating costs (EUR52.56 per 
passenger in the 2013 fiscal year, an increase from EUR48.90 in fiscal 2012).
 The market's acceptance of Ryanair's low-fares service is reflected in the "Ryanair Effect" - Ryanair's history of 
stimulating significant annual passenger traffic growth on the new routes on which it has commenced service since 
1991. For example, on the basis of the "U.K. Airports Annual Statement of Movements, Passengers and Cargo" 
published by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority and statistics released by the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(the "ICAO"), the number of scheduled airline passengers traveling between Dublin and London increased from 1.7 
million passengers in 1991 to 3.7 million passengers in the 2012 calendar year. Most international routes Ryanair 
has begun serving since 1991 have recorded significant traffic growth in the period following Ryanair's 
commencement of service, with Ryanair capturing the largest portion of such growth on each such route. A variety 
of factors contributed to this increase in air passenger traffic, including the relative strength of the Irish, U.K., and 
European economies in past years. However, management believes that the most significant factors driving such 
growth across all its European routes have been Ryanair's low-fares policy and its superiority to its competitors in 
terms of flight punctuality, levels of lost baggage, and rates of flight cancellations.
 The address of Ryanair Holdings' registered office is: c/o Ryanair Limited, Corporate Head Office, Dublin Airport, 
County Dublin, Ireland. The Company's contact person regarding this Annual Report on Form 20-F is: Howard 
Millar, Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer (same address as above). The telephone number is 
+353-1-812-1212 and the facsimile number is +353-1-812-1213. Under its current Articles, Ryanair Holdings has an 
unlimited corporate duration.
 STRATEGY
 Ryanair's objective is to firmly establish itself as Europe's biggest scheduled passenger airline, through continued 
improvements and expanded offerings of its low-fares service. In the highly challenging current operating 
environment, Ryanair seeks to offer low fares that generate increased passenger traffic while maintaining a 
continuous focus on cost-containment and operating efficiencies. The key elements of Ryanair's long-term strategy 
are:
 Low Fares. Ryanair's low fares are designed to stimulate demand, particularly from fare-conscious leisure and 
business travelers who might otherwise use alternative forms of transportation or choose not to travel at all. Ryanair 
sells seats on a one-way basis, thus eliminating minimum stay requirements from all travel on Ryanair scheduled 
services. Ryanair sets fares on the basis of the demand for particular flights and by reference to the period 
remaining to the date of departure of the flight, with higher fares typically charged on flights with higher levels of 
demand and for bookings made nearer to the date of departure. Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional 
fare campaigns. See "-Route System, Scheduling and Fares-Low and Widely Available Fares" below.
 Customer Service. Ryanair's strategy is to deliver the best customer service performance in its peer group. 
According to the data available from the Association of European Airlines ("AEA") and airlines' own published 
statistics, Ryanair has achieved better punctuality, fewer lost bags, and fewer cancellations than its peer group in 
Europe. Ryanair achieves this by focusing strongly on the execution of these services and by primarily operating 
from un-congested airports. Ryanair conducts a daily conference call with Ryanair and airport personnel at each of 
its base airports, during which the reasons for each "first wave" flight delay and baggage short-shipment are 
discussed in detail and logged to ensure that the root cause is identified and rectified. Subsequent (consequential) 
delays and short shipments are investigated by Ryanair ground operations personnel. Customer satisfaction is also 
measured by regular online, mystery-passenger and by passenger surveys.
 Frequent Point-to-Point Flights on Short-Haul Routes. Ryanair provides frequent point-to-point service on short-
haul routes to secondary and regional airports in and around major population centers and travel destinations. In 
the 2013 fiscal year, Ryanair flew an average route length of 754 miles and an average flight duration of 
approximately 1.75 hours. Short-haul routes allow Ryanair to offer its low fares and frequent service, while 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -23-
eliminating the need to provide unnecessary "frills," like free in-flight meals and movies, otherwise expected by 
customers on longer flights. Point-to-point flying (as opposed to hub-and-spoke service) allows Ryanair to offer 
direct, non-stop routes and avoid the costs of providing "through service," for connecting passengers, including 
baggage transfer and transit passenger assistance.
 In choosing its routes, Ryanair primarily favors secondary airports with convenient transportation to major 
population centers and regional airports. Secondary and regional airports are generally less congested than major 
airports and, as a result, can be expected to provide higher rates of on-time departures, faster turnaround times (the 
time an aircraft spends at a gate loading and unloading passengers), fewer terminal delays, more competitive 
airport access, and lower handling costs. Ryanair's "on time" performance record (arrivals within 15 minutes of 
schedule) for the 2013 fiscal year was 91%. Faster turnaround times are a key element in Ryanair's efforts to 
maximize aircraft utilization. Ryanair's average scheduled turnaround time for the 2013 fiscal year was 
approximately 25 minutes.
 Low Operating Costs.Management believes that Ryanair's operating costs are among the lowest of any European 
scheduled-passenger airline. Ryanair strives to reduce or control four of the primary expenses involved in running a 
major scheduled airline: (i) aircraft equipment costs; (ii) personnel costs; (iii) customer service costs; and (iv) airport 
access and handling costs:

 23           Commitments and contingencies
 Commitments
 In January 2002, the Company entered into a contract with Boeing (the "2002 Boeing contract") whereby the 
Company agreed to purchase 100 new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, and received purchase rights 
to acquire a further 50 such aircraft. The 2002 Boeing contract was superseded by a contract entered into 
with Boeing in January 2003 (the "2003 Boeing contract") whereby the Company agreed to purchase 125 new 
Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, thus adding "firm" orders for 22 aircraft to the existing 
"firm" orders (100 "firm" orders, plus three options exercised) under the 2002 Boeing contract. In 
addition, the Company acquired purchase rights over a further 78 aircraft, bringing the number of option 
aircraft to 125.
 In February 2005, the Company entered into another contract with Boeing (the "2005 Boeing contract") 
whereby the Company agreed to purchase 70 new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft and acquired 
additional purchase rights to acquire a further 70 such aircraft over a five-year period from 2006 to 2012 
(subsequently extended to 2013). The aircraft to be delivered after January 1, 2005, arising from the 2002 
and 2003 Boeing contracts, benefit from the discounts and concessions under the 2005 Boeing contract. In 
addition, the orders for the 89 "firm" aircraft still to be delivered at January 1, 2005 and the remaining 
additional purchase rights in respect of 123 aircraft granted under the 2002 and 2003 Boeing contracts are 
governed by the 2005 Boeing contract from January 2005.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -87-

The "Basic Price" (equivalent to a standard list price for an aircraft of this type) for each aircraft governed by the 
2005 Boeing contract will be increased by (a) an estimated U.S.$900,000 per aircraft for certain "buyer furnished" 
equipment the Company has asked Boeing to purchase and install on each of the aircraft, and (b) an "Escalation 
Factor" designed to increase the Basic Price, as defined in the purchase agreement, of any individual aircraft by 
applying a formula which reflects increases in the published U.S. Employment Cost and Producer Price indices 
between the time the Basic Price was set and the period of six months prior to the delivery of such aircraft.
 Boeing has granted Ryanair certain price concessions with regard to the Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft. 
These take the form of credit memoranda to the Company for the amount of such concessions, which the Company 
may apply toward the purchase of goods and services from Boeing or toward certain payments, in respect of the 
purchase of the aircraft under the various Boeing contracts.
 Boeing and CFMI (the manufacturer of the engines to be fitted on the purchased aircraft) have also agreed to give 
the Company certain allowances in addition to providing other goods and services to the Company on 
concessionary terms. These credit memoranda and allowances will effectively reduce the price of each aircraft to 
the Company. As a result, the effective price of each aircraft will be significantly below the Basic Price mentioned 
above. At March 31, 2013, the total potential commitment to acquire all 175 "firm" aircraft, not taking such increases 
and decreases into account, will be approximately U.S. $14.2 billion.  At March 31, 2012, the total potential 
commitment was U.S. $0.8 billion to acquire all 15 "firm" aircraft).
 Operating leases
 The Company financed 76 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between December 2003 and March 2013 
under seven-year, sale-and-leaseback arrangements with a number of international leasing companies, pursuant to 
which each lessor purchased an aircraft and leased it to Ryanair under an operating lease. Between October 2010 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -87-
and December 2012, 17 operating lease aircraft were returned to the lessor at the agreed maturity date of the 
lease. At March 31, 2013 Ryanair had 59 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but 
does not own, these aircraft. Ryanair has no right or obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant 
lease terms. Thirty of these leases are denominated in euro and require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments 
over the term of the leases. 29 remaining operating leases are U.S. dollar-denominated which require Ryanair to 
make fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend the initial period of seven years on 41 of the 59 
remaining operating lease aircraft as at March 31, 2013, on pre-determined terms. Fifteenoperating lease 
arrangements will mature during the year ended March 31, 2014.  The following table sets out the total future 
minimum payments of leasing 59 aircraft (2012: 59 aircraft; 2011: 51 aircraft), ignoring movement in interest rates, 
foreign currency and hedging arrangements, at March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively:

Estimation of fair values
 Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length 
transaction between informed and willing parties, other than as part of a forced liquidation sale. The 
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the 
Company's financial instruments:
 Cash and liquid resources: Carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these 
instruments. Cash and liquid resources comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and 
restricted cash.
 Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at the 
relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 
to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
estimated amount Ryanair would receive or pay to terminate the contracts. Discounted cash-flow analyses 
are based on forward interest rates.
 Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk management profile at March 31, 2013, 2012 
and 2011 has been made.
 The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet categorised by 
the type of valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: Inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.
 --   Level 2: Inputs are based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are 
not active, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and model-based valuation techniques 
for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable 
market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 --   Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability are not based on observable market data.

 The terms of Reference of the Audit Committee are reviewed annually.
 Remuneration Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Remuneration Committee in September 1996. This committee has 
authority to determine the remuneration of senior executives of the Company and to administer the stock 
option plans described below.  Senior Management remuneration is comprised of a fixed basic pay and 
performance related bonuses which are awarded based on a combination of the achievement of individual 
objectives and the Company's financial performance. The Board of Directors as a whole determines the 
remuneration and bonuses of the Chief Executive Officer, who is the only executive director. James 
Osborne, Louise Phelan and Julie O'Neill are the members of the Remuneration Committee.
 The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in its written terms of 
reference, which are available on the Company's website            www.ryanair.com. The terms of Reference 
of the Remuneration Committee are reviewed annually.
 Nomination Committee
 Messrs. David Bonderman, Michael O'Leary and Kyran McLaughlin are the members of the Nomination 
Committee. The Nomination Committee assists the Board in ensuring that the composition of the Board and 
its Committees is appropriate to the needs of the Company by:
 --      assessing the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity,  required on the Board and the extent 
to which each are represented;
 --      establishing processes for the identification of suitable candidates for appointment to the 
Board; and
 --      overseeing succession planning for the Board and senior management.
 The role and responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are set out in its written terms of reference, 
which are available on the Company's website            www.ryanair.com. The terms of Reference of the 
Nomination committee are reviewed annually.
 On December 13, 2012, upon recommendations of the Nomination Committee, the Board appointed Louise Phelan 
and Julie O'Neill to the positions of non-executive directors. Similarly Dick Milliken was appointed to 
the board upon recommendation of the Nomination Committee on July 26, 2013. Their biographies can be found 
on page 103. Their appointment followed a process undertaken by the Nomination Committee which carefully 
considered the Board's requirements, identified suitable candidates, in terms of quality of individual, 
qualification and experience, and made recommendations to the Board. The Nomination Committee used their 
extensive business and professional contacts to identify suitable candidates.
 Air Safety Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Air Safety Committee in March 1997 to review and discuss air 
safety and related issues. The Air Safety Committee reports to the full Board of Directors each quarter. 
The Air Safety Committee is composed of Michael Horgan (who acts as the chairman), as well as the 
following executive officers of Ryanair: Messrs. Ray Conway, Michael Hickey, David O'Brien and Edward 
Wilson.
 Code of Business Conduct
 Ryanair's standards of integrity and ethical values have been established and are documented in Ryanair's 
Code of Business Conduct. This code is applicable to all Ryanair employees. There are established channels 
for reporting code violations or other concerns in a confidential manner. The Head of Internal Audit 
investigates any instances and reports findings directly to the Audit Committee.  The Code is available on

Body
 The Board has established a formal process to annually evaluate the performance of the Board, that of its 
principal Committees, the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees, and that of the Chief Executive,  
the Chairman and individual non-executive directors. The Board anticipates that the formal evaluation will 
be completed yearly. Based on the evaluation process completed, the Board considers that the principal 
Committees have performed effectively throughout the year. As part of the Board evaluation of its own 
performance, questionnaires are circulated to all directors. The questionnaire is designed to obtain 
directors' comments regarding the performance of the Board, the effectiveness of Board communications, the 
ability of directors to contribute to the development of strategy and the effectiveness with which the 
Board monitors risk and oversees Ryanair's progress.  Directors are also invited to make recommendations 
for improvement.
 The Chairman, on behalf of the Board, reviews the evaluations of performance of the non-executive 
directors on an annual basis. The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, meet 
annually without the Chairman present to evaluate his performance, having taken into account the views of 
the executive director. The non-executive directors also evaluate the performance of the executive 
director. These evaluations are designed to determine whether each director continues to contribute 
effectively and to demonstrate commitment to the role.
 The Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees carry out annual reviews of their own performance and 
terms of reference to ensure they are operating at maximum effectiveness and recommend any changes they 
consider necessary to the Board for approval.
 The Board considers the results of the evaluation process and any issues identified.  The above 
evaluations were conducted in May 2012 and were presented to the Board at the September 2012 Board meeting 
in respect of the year under review.
 Shareholders
 Ryanairrecognises the importance of communications with shareholders. Ryanair communicates with all of 
its shareholders following the release of quarterly and annual results directly via road shows, investor 
days and/or by conference calls. The Chief Executive, senior financial, operational, and commercial 
management participate in these events.
 During the year ended March 31, 2013 the Company held discussions with a substantial number of 
institutional investors.
 The Board is kept informed of the views of shareholders through the executive director's and executive 
management's attendance at investor presentations and results presentations. Furthermore, relevant 
feedback from such meetings and investor relations analyst reports are provided to the entire Board on a 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -8-
regular basis. In addition, the Board determines, on a case by case basis, specific issues where it would 
be appropriate for the Chairman and/or Senior Independent Director to communicate directly with 
shareholders or to indicate that they are available to communicate if shareholders so wish. If any of the 
non-executive directors wishes to attend meetings with major shareholders, arrangements are made 
accordingly.
 General Meetings
 All shareholders are given adequate notice of the AGM at which the Chairman reviews the results and 
comments on current business activity. Financial, operational and other information on the Company is 
provided on our website at www.ryanair.com.
 Ryanair will continue to propose a separate resolution at the AGM on each substantially separate issue, 
including a separate resolution relating to the Directors' Report and financial statements. In order to 
comply with the 2010 Code, proxy votes will be announced at the AGM, following each vote on a show of 
hands, except in the event of a poll being called. The Board Chairman and the Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions from all shareholders.
 The Chief Executive makes a presentation at the Annual General Meeting on the Group's business and its 
performance during the prior year and answers questions from shareholders. The AGM affords shareholders 
the opportunity to question the Chairman and the Board.
 All holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings of the Company, 
subject to limitations described under note "Limitations on the Right to Own Shares" on page 124. In 
accordance with Irish company law, the Company specifies record dates for general meetings, by which date 
shareholders must be registered in the Register of Members of the Company to be entitled to attend.  
Record dates are specified in the notes to the Notice convening the meeting.
 Shareholders may exercise their right to vote by appointing a proxy/proxies, by electronic means or in 
writing, to vote some or all of their shares. The requirements for the receipt of valid proxy forms are 
set out in the notes to the Notice convening the Meeting.
 A shareholder or group of shareholders, holding at least 5% of the issued share capital has the right to 
requisition a general meeting. A shareholder, or a group of shareholders, holding at least 3% of the 
issued share capital of the Company, has the right to put an item on the agenda of an AGM or to table a 
draft resolution for an item on the agenda of the general meeting provided that such item is accompanied 
by reasons justifying its inclusion or the full text of any draft resolution proposed to be adopted at the 
general meeting. A request by a member to put an item on the agenda or to table a draft resolution shall 
be received by the company in hardcopy form or in electronic form at least 42 days before the AGM to which 
it relates.
 Notice of the Annual General Meeting and the Form of Proxy are sent to shareholders at least twenty-one 
working days before the meeting. The Company's Annual Report is available on the Company's website,       
     www.ryanair.com. The 2013 Annual General Meeting will be held at 9a.m. on September 20, 2013 in the 
Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Co Dublin, Ireland.
 All general meetings other than the Annual General Meeting are called Extraordinary General Meetings 
(EGMs). An EGM must be called by giving at least twenty-one clear days' notice. Except in relation to an 
adjourned meeting, three members, present in person or by proxy, entitled to vote upon the business to be 
transacted, shall be a quorum. The passing of resolutions at a general meeting, other than special 
resolution, requires a simple majority. To be passed, a special resolution requires a majority of at least 
75% of the votes cast. Votes may be given in person by a show of hands, or by proxy.
 At the Meeting, after each resolution has been dealt with, details are given of the level of proxy votes 
cast on each resolution and the numbers for, against and withheld.  This information is made available on 
the Company's website following the meeting.
 Risk Management and Internal Control
 The directors have overall responsibility for the Company's system of risk management and internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the system 
of risk management and internal control which is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
 In accordance with the revised FRC (Turnbull) guidance for directors on internal control published in 
October 2005, 'Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code', the Board confirms 
that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks faced by 
the Group, that it has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
financial statements and that this process is regularly reviewed by the Board.
 In accordance with the provisions of the 2010 Code the directors review the effectiveness of the 
Company's system of internal control including:
 --   Financial
 --   Operational
 --   Compliance
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -8-
 --   Risk Management
 The Board is ultimately responsible for the Company's system of risk management and internal controls and 
for monitoring its effectiveness. The key procedures that have been established to provide effective risk 
management and internal control include:
 --   a strong and independent Board which meets at least 4 times a year and has separate Chief Executive 
and Chairman roles;
 --   a clearly defined organisational structure along functional lines and a clear division of 
responsibility and authority in the Company;
 --   a comprehensive system of internal financial reporting which includes preparation of detailed 
monthly management accounts, providing key performance indicators and financial results for each major 
function within the Company;
 --   preparation and issue of financial reports to shareholders and the markets, including the Annual 
Report and consolidated financial statements, is overseen by the Audit Committee. The Company's financial 
reporting process is controlled using documented accounting policies and reporting formats, supplemented 
by detailed instructions and guidance on reporting requirements. The Company's processes support the 
integrity and quality of data, including appropriate segregation of duties. The financial information of 
the parent entity and all subsidiary entities, which form the basis for the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are subject to scrutiny by Group level senior management. The Company's 
financial reports, financial guidance, and Annual Report and consolidated financial statements are also 
reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board in advance of being presented to the full Board for their 
review and approval;
 --   quarterly reporting of the financial performance with a management discussion and analysis of 
results;

 25           Dividends and share buy-backs
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5 
million. This trade settled in early April 2012.  This is equivalent to approximately 1.0% of the 
Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share 
capital decreased by 15.0 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.1 million and the capital 
redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.1 million.  The capital redemption reserve is 
required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 At the Company's AGM on September 21, 2012, a dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary share was approved by the 
shareholders. The dividend totalling EUR491.5 million was paid to shareholders on November 30, 2012
 In August 2011, the Company bought back 27.0 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR85.1 million.  In 
March 2012, the Company bought back a further 9.5 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR39.5 million.  
Overall this is equivalent to approximately 2.5% of the Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary 
shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 36.5 million ordinary 
shares with a nominal value of EUR0.2 million and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.2 million which has been transferred from retained earnings.  The capital redemption 
reserve is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the parent Company. See 
note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
 26           Post-balance sheet events
 On May 27, 2013 the Company issued a Class 1 circular to shareholders seeking their approval for the 
purchase of 175 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, with a list value of approximately US$14.2 billion, in 
advance of an EGM. The EGM was held June 18, 2013 and shareholders approved the transaction.  In 
accordance with the terms of the contract entered into with Boeing, the Group made stage payments to 
Boeing in April, May and June 2013 in relation to the purchase of these aircraft.
 In June 2013 the Company bought back 24.1 million ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6 million, 
for cancellation.  Cumulatively these buybacks are equivalent to 1.7% of the issued share capital of the 
Company. Also in June 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders over 
the next two years with at least EUR400.0 million (EUR176.6 million already completed in June 2013) in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -89-
share buybacks to be completed in fiscal year 2014 and a further EUR600.0 million in either special 
dividends or share buybacks in fiscal year 2015 subject to current fuel, yields and profitability trends 
continuing.

Body
 Maintenance and repair services that may become necessary while an aircraft is located at some of the other 
airports served by Ryanair are provided by other Part 145-approved contract maintenance providers. Aircraft return 
each evening to Ryanair's bases, where they are examined by either Ryanair's approved engineers or by local Part 
145-approved companies.
 Heavy Maintenance
 As noted above, Ryanair currently has sufficient capacity to be able to carry out all of the routine maintenance work 
required on its Boeing 737-800 fleet itself. Ryanair opened a new three-bay maintenance hangar at Glasgow 
(Prestwick) airport in winter 2010 to accommodate the additional maintenance requirements arising from its 
expanding and aging fleet and opened a new C-check facility in Kaunas in January 2013 to carry out light C -
checks.
 Ryanair contracts out engine overhaul service for its Boeing 737-800 aircraft to General Electric Engine Services 
pursuant to a 10-year agreement with an option for a 10-year extension, signed in 2004. This comprehensive 
maintenance contract provides for the repair and overhaul of the CFM56-7B series engines fitted to the first 155 of 
Ryanair's Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the repair of parts and general technical support for the fleet of engines. On June 
30, 2008, the Company finalized a contract for a similar level of coverage and support for the engines on all of its 
aircraft that have been or were scheduled to be delivered over the period through November 2012. Due to the fact 
that engines on recently delivered aircraft will not require a scheduled engine overhaul prior to the expiry of the 
current contract with GE, Ryanair has decided, at this time, not to take up its option to have engines delivered with 
aircraft after October 2010 covered by this contract. General Electric Engine Services mainly uses its Part 145-
approved repair facility in Cardiff, Wales for this work, but also uses the KLM Part 145-approved facility in 
Amsterdam, and occasionally its Part 145-approved facility in Celma, Brazil. By contracting with experienced Part 
145-approved maintenance providers, management believes it is better able to ensure the quality of its aircraft and 
engine maintenance. Ryanair assigns a Part 145-certified mechanic to oversee all heavy maintenance and to 
authorize all engine overhauls performed by third parties. Maintenance providers are also monitored closely by the 
national authorities under EASA and national regulations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -27-
 Ryanair expects to be dependent on external service contractors, particularly for engine and component 
maintenance, for the foreseeable future, notwithstanding the additional capabilities provided by its maintenance 
facilities at Dublin, Glasgow (Prestwick), London (Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn) and Kaunas. See "Item 3. Key 
Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-The Company Is Dependent on External Service 
Providers."
 SAFETY RECORD
 Ryanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality in its 29-year operating history. Ryanair demonstrates 
its commitment to safe operations through its safety training procedures, its investment in safety-related equipment, 
and its adoption of an internal open and confidential reporting system for safety issues. The Company's Board of 
Directors also has an air safety committee to review and discuss air safety and related issues. Michael Horgan, a 
Company director, is the chairman of this committee and reports to the Board of Directors.
 Ryanair's flight training is oriented towards accident prevention and covers all aspects of flight operations. Threat 
and Error Management (TEM) is at the core of all flight crew training programs. Ryanair maintains full control of the 
content and delivery of all of its flight crew training, including initial, recurrent, and upgrade phases. All training 
programs are approved by the Irish Aviation Authority (the "IAA"), which regularly audits operation control standards 
and flight crew training standards for compliance with EU legislation.
 All of the Boeing 737-800s that Ryanair has bought or committed to buy are certified for Category IIIA landings 
(automatic landings with minimum horizontal visibility of 200 meters and a 50 feet decision height).
 Ryanair has a comprehensive and documented safety management system. Management encourages flight crews 
to report any safety-related issues through the Safety Alert Initial Report reporting program or to use the confidential 
reporting system, which is available online through Ryanair's Crewdock system. The confidential reporting system 
affords flight crews the opportunity to report directly to Flight Safety Officer any event, error, or discrepancy in flight 
operations that they do not wish to report through standard reporting channels. The confidential reporting system is 
designed to increase management's awareness of problems that may be encountered by flight crews in their day-
to-day operations. Management uses the information reported through all reporting systems to modify operating 
procedures and improve flight operation standards. Additionally, Ryanair promotes the use of CHIRP, a confidential 
reporting system that is endorsed by the UK CAA as an alternative confidential reporting channel.
 Ryanair has installed an automatic data capturing system on each of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft which captures 
and downloads aircraft performance information for use as part of Operational Flight Data Monitoring (OFDM) which 
automatically provides a confidential report on variations from normal operating limitations detected during the 
course of each flight. The purpose of this system is to monitor operational trends and inform management of any 
instance of an operational limit being exceeded. By analyzing these reports, management is able to identify 
undesirable trends and potential areas of operational risk, so as to take steps to rectify such deviations, thereby 
ensuring adherence to Ryanair's flight safety standards.
 In November 2008, a Ryanair aircraft suffered a multiple bird strike during its final approach to Rome (Ciampino) 
airport. This incident caused substantial damage to the aircraft, which resulted in an insurance claim being filed in 
respect of this aircraft. The damage that it suffered was such that the aircraft was not repaired, although Ryanair 
has retained ownership of it for certain parts and for training purposes.
 AIRPORT OPERATIONS
 Airport Handling Services
 Ryanair provides its own aircraft and passenger handling and ticketing services at Dublin Airport. Third parties 
provide these services to Ryanair at most other airports it serves. Servisair plc provides Ryanair's ticketing, 
passenger and aircraft handling, and ground handling services at many of these airports in Ireland and the U.K. 
(excluding London (Stansted) Airport where these services are provided primarily by Swissport Ltd.), while similar 
services in continental Europe are generally provided by the local airport authorities, either directly or through sub-
contractors. Management attempts to obtain competitive rates for such services by negotiating multi-year contracts 
at fixed prices. These contracts are generally scheduled to expire in one to five years, unless renewed, and certain 
of them may be terminated by either party before their expiry upon prior notice. Ryanair will need to enter into 
similar agreements in any new markets it may enter. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Company-The Company Is Dependent on External Service Providers."
 During 2009, Ryanair introduced Internet check-in for all passengers and also introduced kiosks at certain airports 
for the provision of other services. The Company has these kiosks in operation at many of its key bases.
 Airport Charges
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -27-
 As with other airlines, Ryanair must pay airport charges each time it lands and accesses facilities at the airports it 
serves. Depending on the policy of the individual airport, such charges can include landing fees, passenger loading 
fees, security fees and parking fees. Ryanair attempts to negotiate discounted fees by delivering annual increases 
in passenger traffic, and opts, when practicable, for less expensive facilities, such as less convenient gates and the 
use of outdoor boarding stairs rather than more expensive jetways. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that 
the airports Ryanair uses will not impose higher airport charges in the future and that any such increases would not 
adversely affect the Company's operations.
 As a result of rising airport charges and the introduction of an Air Travel Tax of EUR10 on passengers departing 
from Irish airports on routes longer than 300 kilometers from Dublin Airport (EUR2 on shorter routes), Ryanair 
reduced its fleet at Dublin airport to 13 during winter 2010 (down from 22 in summer 2008 and 20 in winter 2008). 
The introduction of the aforementioned EUR10 tax has likely had a negative impact on the number of passengers 
traveling to and from Ireland. The Dublin Airport Authority ("DAA") has reported that passenger volumes declined by 
25% from 30 million in 2007 to 23 million in 2012. Ryanair believes that this is partly reflective of the negative 
impact of the tax on Irish travel. Ryanair has called for the elimination of the tax to stimulate tourism during the 
recession. The Company has cited the example of the Dutch government, which withdrew its travel tax with effect 
from July 1, 2009. The Dutch travel tax had ranged from EUR11 for short-haul flights to EUR45 for long-haul flights 
and had resulted in a significant decline in passenger volumes at Schiphol Airport, Holland's main airport, according 
to data published by the airport. Ryanair also complained to the European Commission about the unlawful 
differentiation in the level of the Irish Air Travel tax between routes within the EU. From April 2011, a single rate 
(EUR3) of the Air Travel Tax has been introduced on all routes. In May 2011, the Irish Government announced that 
it would abolish the Air Travel Tax, although no details were provided as to when this decision would be 
implemented. No assurance can be given

 Under IFRS, these foreign currency forward contracts are treated as cash-flow hedges of forecast U.S. dollar and 
U.K. pound sterling purchases to address the risks arising from U.S. dollar and U.K. pound sterling exchange rates. 
The derivatives are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the end of each 
reporting period through equity to the extent effective, with ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. 
Ryanair considers these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from 
fluctuations in exchange rates, because the forward contracts are timed so as to match exactly the amount, 
currency and maturity date of the forecast foreign currency-denominated expense being hedged. In the 2013 fiscal 
year, the Company recorded a positive fair-value adjustment of EUR42.3 million (net of tax) within accumulated 
other comprehensive income in respect of these contracts, as compared to a positive adjustment of EUR86.1 
million in the 2012 fiscal year.
 Hedging associated with the balance sheet. In the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years, the Company entered into a series 
of cross currency interest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of US dollar-
denominated floating rate borrowings entered into during the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years, together with managing 
the exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on these US dollar-denominated floating rate borrowings. Cross 
currency interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated debt 
to euro and floating rate interest exposures into fixed rate exposures and are set so as to match exactly the critical 
terms of the underlying debt being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest rate settings, re-pricing dates). These are 
all classified as cash-flow hedges of the forecasted U.S. dollar variable interest payments on the Company's 
underlying debt and have been determined to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no 
ineffectiveness has been recorded in the income statement relating to these hedges in the 2012 and 2013 fiscal 
years.
 At March 31, 2013, the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swap agreements relating to this U.S. dollar-
denominated floating rate debt was represented by a loss of EUR11.7 million (gross of tax) compared to a loss of 
EUR7.4 million in fiscal 2012. In the 2013 fiscal year, the Company recorded a negative fair-value adjustment of 
EUR10.2 million (net of tax), compared to a loss of EUR6.5 million in fiscal 2012, within accumulated other 
comprehensive income in respect of these contracts.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -57-
 Hedging associated with capital expenditures. During the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years, the Company also entered 
into a series of euro/U.S. dollar contracts to hedge against changes in the fair value of aircraft purchase 
commitments under the Boeing contracts, which arise from fluctuations in the U.K. pound sterling/U.S. dollar and 
euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates. There were no such contracts in effect at March 31, 2013.
 Under IFRS, the Company generally accounts for these contracts as either cash-flow hedges or fair-value hedges. 
Fair-value hedges are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Any gains or losses arising on these instruments, 
as well as the related gain or loss on the underlying aircraft purchase commitment, are recorded in the balance 
sheet. Any related ineffectiveness is measured by the amount by which these adjustments to earnings do not 
match. Cash-flow hedges are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the 
end of the financial period through equity to the extent effective, with any ineffectiveness recorded through the 
income statement. The Company has found these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair 
value of the aircraft purchase commitments arising from fluctuations in exchange rates because the forward 
exchange contracts are always for the same amount, currency and maturity dates as the corresponding aircraft 
purchase commitments.
 At March 31, 2013, the total unrealized gains relating to these contracts amounted to EURnil, while at March 31, 
2012 unrealized gains amounted to EUR6.8 million. Under IFRS, the Company recorded fair-value adjustments of 
EURnil and positive fair-value adjustments of EUR6.0 million for cash-flow hedges in the 2013 and 2012 fiscal 
years, respectively. No amounts were recorded for such fair-value hedges from other accumulated comprehensive 
income in the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years.
 Holding other variables constant, if there were an adverse change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange 
rates, the market value of Ryanair's foreign currency contracts outstanding at March 31, 2013 would decrease by 
approximately EUR160.0 million (net of tax), all of which would ultimately impact earnings when such contracts 
mature.
 INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 The Company's purchase of 246 of the 305 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 2013 has been 
funded by bank financing in the form of loans supported by a loan guarantee from Ex-Im Bank (with respect to 210 
aircraft), JOLCOs and commercial debt. With respect to these 246 aircraft, at March 31, 2013, the Company had 
outstanding cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,498.4 million with a weighted average interest 
rate of 2.5%. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital 
Resources" for additional information on these facilities and the related swaps, including a tabular summary of the 
"Effective Borrowing Profile" illustrating the effect of the swap transactions (each of which is with an established 
international financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's aircraft-related debt at March 31, 2013. At March 31, 
2013, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements relating to this floating rate debt was represented by a loss 
of EUR81.9 million (gross of tax), as compared with a loss of EUR80.3 million at March 31, 2012. See Note 11 to 
the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for additional information.
 If Ryanair had not entered into such derivative agreements, a plus or minus one percentage point movement in 
interest rates would impact the fair value of this liability by approximately EUR28.8 million. The earnings and cash-
flow impact of any such change in interest rates would have been approximately plus or minus EUR18.3 million in 
the 2013 fiscal year.

 Transactions arising in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies at the rates of 
exchange in effect at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euro at foreign exchange rates in effect at the dates 
the transactions were effected. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, 
except for differences arising on qualifying cash-flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
 Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provisions for 
impairments, if any. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may 
also include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain or loss on qualifying cash-flow hedges of 
foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, 
less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following

 Boeing 737-800s         246(a)            date of       value of new
 aircraft, determined
 manufacture     periodically
______________
 (a)    The Company operated 305 aircraft as of March 31, 2013, of which 59 were leased.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market 
value of new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft 
disposals during prior periods.
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed on acquisition to its service potential, 
reflecting the maintenance condition of its engines and airframe. This cost, which can equate to a 
substantial element of the total aircraft cost, is amortised over the shorter of the period to the next 
maintenance check (usually between 8 and 12 years for Boeing 737-800 aircraft) or the remaining life of 
the aircraft. The costs of subsequent major airframe and engine maintenance checks are capitalised and 
amortised over the shorter of the period to the next check or the remaining life of the aircraft.
 Advance and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options to acquire 
aircraft are recorded at cost and separately disclosed within property, plant and equipment. On 
acquisition of the related aircraft, these payments are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are 
depreciated from that date.
 Rotable spare parts held by the Company are classified as property, plant and equipment if they are 
expected to be used over more than one period.
 Gains and losses on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the 
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised on a 
net basis within other income/(expenses) in profit or loss.
 Aircraft maintenance costs
 The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned 
aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the 
airframe, engines and life-limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, 
maintenance, in the form of major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major 
life-limited parts, is required to be performed during the period of the lease and upon return of the 
aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance costs and the costs associated with 
the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or loss over the lease term 
for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of the major 
airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely 
correlates with the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and 
replenish aircraft held under operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the 
control of Ryanair.  While Ryanair may, in very limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains 
fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such 
sub-leasing.
 All other maintenance costs, other than major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and 
restitution of major life-limited parts costs associated with leased aircraft, are expensed as incurred.
 Intangible assets - landing rights
 Intangible assets acquired are recognised to the extent it is considered probable that expected future 
benefits will flow to the Company and the associated costs can be measured reliably. Landing rights 
acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at that date and are not 
amortised, where those rights are considered to be indefinite. The carrying values of those rights are 
reviewed for impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -64-
changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. No impairment to the 
carrying values of the Company's intangible assets has been recorded to date.
 Available-for-sale securities
 The Company holds certain equity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, and are measured 
at fair value, less incremental direct costs, on initial recognition. Such securities are classified as 
available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate if the Company does not have the power to 
exercise significant influence over the investee. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at 
fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and reflected in shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet. Fair value losses, subsequent to 
any impairments are recognised in other comprehensive income against net cumulative gains in the reserve.  
Fair value losses below the impaired value are recognised in the income statement. The fair values of 
available-for-sale securities are determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets at each 
reporting date. When an investment is de-recognised the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive 
income is transferred to the income statement.
 Such securities are considered to be impaired if there is objective evidence which indicates that events 
have occurred that can reasonably be expected to adversely affect the  future cash flows of the 
securities, such that the future cash flows do not support the current fair value of the securities. This 
includes where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. All 
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and any cumulative loss in respect of an 
available-for-sale asset recognised previously in other comprehensive income is also transferred to the 
income statement.
 Other financial assets
 Other financial assets (other than available-for-sale financial assets) comprise cash deposits of greater 
than three months' maturity. All amounts are categorised as loans and receivables and are carried 
initially at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method in 
the balance sheet.
 Derivative financial instruments
 Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and 
currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimise the impact

Body
 The Company has carried out an evaluation, as of March 31, 2013, under the supervision and with the 
participation of the Company's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial 
officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). There are inherent 
limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the 
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. 
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of 
achieving their control objectives. Based upon the Company's evaluation, the chief executive officer and 
chief financial officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2013, the disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports 
the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and 
when required, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is 
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the chief executive officer and chief 
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over 
financial reporting, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company's 
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with IFRS. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that:
 --      pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
 --      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors; and
 --      provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
 The Company's management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in the 1992 Framework in "Internal 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -58-
Control - Integrated Framework," issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission ("COSO"). Based on the evaluation, management has concluded that the Company maintained 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013.
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Body
 Ryanair's current business strategy dates to the early 1990s, when a new management team, including the current 
chief executive, commenced the restructuring of Ryanair's operations to become a low-fares airline based on the 
low-cost operating model pioneered by Southwest Airlines Co. in the United States. During the period between 
1992 and 1994, Ryanair expanded its route network to include scheduled passenger services between Dublin and 
Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow (Prestwick). In 1994, Ryanair began standardizing its fleet by purchasing 
used Boeing 737-200A aircraft to replace substantially all of its leased aircraft. Beginning in 1996, Ryanair 
continued to expand its service from Dublin to new provincial destinations in the U.K. In August 1996, Irish Air, L.P., 
an investment vehicle led by David Bonderman and certain of his associates at the Texas Pacific Group, acquired a 
minority interest in the Company. Ryanair Holdings completed its initial public offering in June 1997.
 From 1997 through June 30, 2013, Ryanair launched service on more than 1,600 routes throughout Europe and 
also increased the frequency of service on a number of its principal routes. During that period, in addition to Dublin, 
Ryanair established 57 airports as bases of operations. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Route System, 
Scheduling and Fares" for a list of these bases. Ryanair has increased the number of booked passengers from 4.9 
million in the 1999 fiscal year to approximately 79.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year. Ryanair had 303 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft as of June 30, 2013, and now serves approximately 180 airports with a team of over 9,000 people.
 Ryanair expects to have approximately 410 aircraft in its operating fleet by March 31, 2019. This is subject to lease 
handbacks and disposals over the period to March 31, 2019 meeting current expectations. See "3/4Liquidity and 
Capital Resources" and "Item 4. Information on the Company3/4Aircraft" for additional details.
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 Since Ryanair pioneered its ultra-low cost operating model in Europe in the early 1990s, its passenger volumes 
and scheduled passenger revenues have increased significantly because it has substantially increased capacity 
and demand has been sufficient to match the increased capacity. Ryanair's annual booked passenger volume has 
grown from approximately 945,000 passengers in the calendar year 1992 to approximately 79.3 million passengers 
in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Ryanair's revenue passenger miles ("RPMs") increased approximately 2% from 58,584.5 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to 59,865.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year due primarily to an increase of approximately 2% in scheduled 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -33-
available seat miles ("ASMs") from 71,139.7 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 72,829.9 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year. Scheduled passenger revenues increased approximately 9% from EUR3,504.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year 
to EUR3,819.8 million in the 2013 fiscal year. Average booked passenger fare increased from EUR45.36 in the 
2012 fiscal year to EUR48.20 in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Expanding passenger volumes and capacity, high load factors and aggressive cost containment have enabled 
Ryanair to continue to generate operating profits despite increasing price competition and increases in certain 
costs. Ryanair's total break-even load factor was 70% in both the 2012 fiscal year and the 2013 fiscal year. Cost 
per passenger was EUR48.90 in the 2012 fiscal year and EUR52.56 in the 2013 fiscal year, with the increase 
primarily reflecting the higher fuel cost per passenger of EUR23.79 in the 2013 fiscal year, as compared to 
EUR21.02 in the 2012 fiscal year, as well as an increase of approximately 5% in passengers in the 2013 fiscal year. 
Ryanair recorded operating profits of EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year and EUR718.2 million in the 2013 
fiscal year. The Company recorded a profit after taxation of EUR560.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year and profit after 
taxation of EUR569.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year. Ryanair recorded seat capacity growth of approximately 5% in 
the 2013 fiscal year, compared to approximately 6% in the 2012 fiscal year, and expects capacity to increase by 
approximately 3% in the 2014 fiscal year. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the 
Company- Ryanair Has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft."
 Investment in Aer Lingus
 The Company owns 29.8% of Aer Lingus, which it acquired in fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 at a total cost of 
EUR407.2 million. Following the approval of its shareholders, management proposed in the 2007 fiscal year to 
effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by 
the European Commission on competition grounds in June 2007. Ryanair's management viewed the acquisition of 
Aer Lingus in the context of the overall trend of consolidation among airlines in Europe and believed that the 
acquisition would lead to the formation of one strong Irish airline group able to compete with large carriers such as 
Lufthansa, Air France/KLM and British Airways/Iberia (now "International Airlines Group"). During the EU 
competition review, the Company made a commitment that if the acquisition was approved, Ryanair would eliminate 
Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges and reduce its fares, which would have resulted in Aer Lingus passengers saving 
approximately EUR100 million per year. The Company was thus surprised and disappointed by the European 
Commission's decision to prohibit this offer. This decision was the first adverse decision taken in respect of any EU 
airline merger and the first-ever adverse decision in respect of a proposed merger of two companies with less than 
5% of the EU market for their services. Ryanair filed an appeal with the CFI, which was heard in July 2009. On July 
6, 2010, the CFI upheld the Commission's decision.
 In October 2007, the European Commission also reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell 
its shares in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus appealed this decision before the CFI. This case was heard in July 2009 and 
on July 6, 2010 the court rejected Aer Lingus' appeal and confirmed that Ryanair cannot be forced to dispose of its 
29.8% stake in Aer Lingus. However, EU legislation may change in the future to require such a forced disposition. If 
eventually forced to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the negative 
impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
 On December 1, 2008, Ryanair made a new offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own 
at a price of EUR1.40 per ordinary share. Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the 
Aer Lingus brand, and retain its Heathrow slots and connectivity. Ryanair also proposed to double Aer Lingus' 
short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft and to create 1,000 associated new jobs over a five-year period. If the offer 
had been accepted, the Irish government would have received over EUR180 million in cash. The employee share 
ownership trust and employees, who owned 18% of Aer Lingus, would have received over EUR137 million in cash. 
The Company met Aer Lingus management, representatives of the employee share ownership trust and other 
parties, including members of the Irish Government. The offer of EUR1.40 per share represented a premium of 
approximately 25% over the closing price of EUR1.12 for Aer Lingus shares on November 28, 2008. As the 
Company was unable to secure the shareholders' support, it decided on January 28, 2009 to withdraw its offer for 
Aer Lingus.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intended 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. Ryanair maintains that the OFT had the opportunity, which it missed, to investigate Ryanair's minority 
stake within four months from the European Commission's June 2007 decision to prohibit Ryanair's takeover of Aer 
Lingus. The OFT agreed in October 2010 to suspend its investigation pending the outcome of Ryanair's appeal 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -33-
against the OFT's decision that its investigation is within time. On July 28, 2011, the Competition Appeal Tribunal 
ruled that the OFT was not time barred when it attempted in September 2010 to open an investigation into 
Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair subsequently appealed the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision.  On November 24, 2011, the UK Court of Appeal ordered a stay of the 
OFT's investigation pending the Courts review of whether the OFT's investigation was time barred.  On May 22, 
2012, the Court of Appeal found that the OFT was not time barred to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer 
Lingus in September 2010.  Ryanair subsequently sought permission to appeal that ruling to the UK Supreme 
Court, but permission was refused. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake 
in Aer Lingus to the UK Competition Commission. The Competition Commission's decision is expected by 
September 05, 2013. The Competition Commission could order Ryanair to divest some or all of its shares in Aer 
Lingus, as a result of which Ryanair could suffer losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced 
sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares. On July 23, 2013 the Company announced that as part of its 
remedies discussions with the UKCC it had offered to give an undertaking to unconditionally sell its shareholding in 
Aer Lingus to any other EU airline that makes an offer for Aer Lingus and acquires acceptances in respect of more 
than 50% of Aer Lingus' issued share capital.

 The Company's net cash provided by financing activities totaled EUR238.1 million in the 2011 fiscal year, largely 
reflecting the receipt of proceeds from long-term borrowings of EUR991.4 million in fiscal year 2011, offset in part 
by repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR280.7 million.
 Capital Expenditures. The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 
were EUR310.7 million and EUR290.4 million, respectively. Ryanair has funded a significant portion of its 
acquisition of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and related equipment through borrowings under facilities provided by 
international financial institutions on the basis of guarantees issued by the Export-Import Bank of the United States 
("Ex-Im Bank"). At March 31, 2013, Ryanair had a fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the majority of which (210 
aircraft) were funded by Ex-Im Bank-guaranteed financing. Other sources of on-balance-sheet aircraft financing 
utilized by Ryanair are Japanese Operating Leases with Call Options ("JOLCOs"), which are treated as finance 
leases (30 of the aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 2013) and commercial debt financing (6 of the aircraft in the 
fleet as of March 31, 2013). Of Ryanair's total fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800 aircraft at March 31, 2013 there were 59 
aircraft which were financed through operating lease arrangements. Of the 15 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft which 
Ryanair took delivery of between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, four were financed through sale-and-leaseback 
financings and the remainder through Ex-Im Bank guaranteed-financing. Ryanair has generally been able to 
generate sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft acquisition-related working capital requirements. 
Management believes that the working capital available to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements 
and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for 
the 2014 fiscal year.
 The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were EUR290.4 million 
and EUR897.2 million, respectively. Of the 25 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft which Ryanair took delivery of between 
April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2012, 11 were financed through sale-and-leaseback financings and the remainder 
through Ex-Im Bank guaranteed-financing.
 The following table sets forth the dates on which and the number of aircraft that will be delivered to the Company 
pursuant to the 2013 Boeing Contract:

Capital Resources. Ryanair's long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled EUR3,498.3 million at March 31, 
2013 and EUR3,625.2 million at March 31, 2012, with the change being primarily attributable to financing of new 
aircraft and repayment of existing debt facilities. Please see the table "Obligations Due by Period" below for more 
information on Ryanair's long-term debt (including current maturities) and finance leases as of March 31, 2013. See 
also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for further information on the maturity 
profile of the interest rate structure and other information on, the Company's borrowings.
 The Company's purchase of the 15 Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered in the 2013 fiscal year has been funded by a 
combination of financing solutions, including bank loans supported by Ex-Im Bank guarantees (eleven aircraft) and 
sale-and-leaseback financings (four aircraft). At March 31, 2013, the majority of the aircraft in Ryanair's fleet had 
been financed through loan facilities with various financial institutions active in the structured export finance sector 
and supported by a loan guarantee from Ex-Im Bank. Each of these facilities takes essentially the same form and is 
based on the documentation developed by Ryanair and Ex-Im Bank, which follows standard market forms for this 
type of financing. In November 2010, Ryanair financed seven aircraft through a U.S. dollar-denominated Ex-Im 
Bank Capital Markets Product ("Eximbond"). The Eximbond has essentially the same characteristics as all previous 
Ex-Im Bank guaranteed financings with no additional obligations on Ryanair. On the basis of an Ex-Im Bank 
guarantee with regard to the financing of up to 85% of the eligible U.S. and foreign content represented in the net 
purchase price of the relevant aircraft, the financial institution investor enters into a commitment letter with the 
Company to provide financing for a specified number of aircraft benefiting from such guarantee; loans are then 
drawn down as the aircraft are delivered and payments to Boeing become due. Each of the loans under the 
facilities are on substantially similar terms, having a maturity of 12 years from the drawdown date and being 
secured by a first priority mortgage in favor of a security trustee on behalf of Ex-Im Bank.
 Through the use of interest rate swaps or cross currency interest rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted a 
portion of its floating-rate debt under its financing facilities into fixed-rate debt. Approximately 34% of the loans for 
the aircraft acquired under the above facilities are not covered by such swaps and have therefore remained at 
floating rates linked to EURIBOR, with the interest rate exposure from these loans largely hedged by placing a 
similar amount of cash on deposit at floating interest rates. The net result is that Ryanair has effectively swapped or 
drawn down fixed-rate euro-denominated debt with maturities between seven and twelve years in respect of 
approximately 66% of its outstanding debt financing at March 31, 2013 and of this total approximately 49% of this 
debt has been partially swapped, with the relevant swaps covering the first seven years of the twelve-year 
amortizing period.
 The table below illustrates the effect of swap transactions (each of which is with an established international 
financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's total outstanding debt at March 31, 2013. See "Item 11. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Exposure and Hedging" for additional 
details on the Company's hedging transactions.
At March 31, 2013                                                                   EUR          EUR

 ==========  ============
The weighted-average interest rate on the cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,498.3 million at 
March 31, 2013 was 2.5%. Ryanair's ability to obtain additional loans pursuant to each of the facilities to finance the 
price of future Boeing 737-800 aircraft purchases is subject to the issuance of further bank commitments and the 
satisfaction of various contractual conditions. These conditions include, among other things, the execution of 
satisfactory documentation, the requirement that Ryanair perform all of its obligations under the Boeing agreements 
and provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and related assets) in favor of the lenders and Ex-Im Bank, 
and that Ryanair not suffer a material adverse change in its conditions or prospects (financial or otherwise).
 As part of its Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing of the Boeing 737-800s, Ryanair has entered into certain 
lease agreements and related arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, legal title to the 210 aircraft 
delivered and remaining in the fleet as of March 31, 2013 rests with a number of United States special purpose 
vehicles (the "SPVs") in which Ryanair has no equity or other interest. The SPVs are the borrowers of record under 
the loans made or to be made under the facilities, with all of their obligations under the loans being guaranteed by 
Ryanair Holdings.

 The shares of the SPVs (which are owned by an unrelated charitable association) are in turn pledged to a security 
trustee in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders. Ryanair operates each of the aircraft pursuant to a finance lease it 
has entered into with the SPVs, the terms of which mirror those of the relevant loans under the facilities. Ryanair 
has the right to purchase the aircraft upon termination of the lease for a nominal amount. Pursuant to this 
arrangement, Ryanair is considered to own the aircraft for accounting purposes under IFRS. Ryanair does not use 
special purpose entities for off-balance sheet financing or any other purpose which results in assets or liabilities not 
being reflected in Ryanair's consolidated financial statements.
 Ryanair has a track record in securing finance for similar sized aircraft purchases. The 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2005 
Boeing Contracts totaling 348 aircraft were financed with approximately 66% US Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees and 
capital markets (with 85% loan to value) financing, 24% through sale and operating leaseback financing, and 10% 
through Japanese operating leases with call options ("JOLCOs"). See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 Under the new Aviation Sector Understanding which came into effect from January 1, 2013, the fees payable to 
Ex-Im Bank for the provision of loan guarantees have significantly increased, thereby making it more expensive 
than more traditional forms of financing. As a result, Ryanair intends to finance the new aircraft obtained under the 
2013 Boeing Contract through a combination of internally generated cash flows, debt financing from commercial 
banks, debt financing through the capital markets in a secured and unsecured manner, commercial debt through 
JOLCOs and sale and operating leasebacks. These forms of financing are generally accepted in the aviation 
industry and are currently widely available for companies who have the credit quality of Ryanair. Ryanair may 
periodically use Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees when appropriate. Ryanair intends to finance pre-delivery payments 
("Aircraft Deposits") to Boeing in respect of the New Aircraft via internally generated cash flows similar to all 
previous Aircraft Deposit payments.
 Using the debt capital markets to finance the 2013 Boeing Contract may require the Company to obtain a credit 
rating or potentially to obtain a credit rating for specific debt transactions, for example using an Enhanced 
Equipment Trust Certificate ("EETC"), a structured product that is widely used in the US to finance aircraft 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -41-
deliveries. The requirement for a credit rating depends amongst other things on whether Ryanair finances the 
aircraft via secured funding or through general corporate purposes.
 At March 31, 2013, Ryanair had 59 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but does not 
own, these aircraft, which were leased to provide flexibility for the aircraft delivery program. Ryanair has no right or 
obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant lease terms. 30 leases are denominated in euro and 
require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments over the term of the lease. The remaining 29 operating leases are 
U.S. dollar-denominated and require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend 
the initial period of seven years on 41 of the 59 remaining operating lease aircraft as of March 31, 2013, on pre-
determined terms. 15 operating lease arrangements will mature during the year ended March 31, 2014. In April 
2013, the Company decided not to extend two leases that were maturing and handed these aircraft back to the 
lessor. In addition to the above, the Company financed 30 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 
2005 and March 2013 with 13-year euro-denominated JOLCOs. These structures are accounted for as finance 
leases and are initially recorded at fair value in the Company's balance sheet. Under each of these contracts, 
Ryanair has a call option to purchase the aircraft at a pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, which it may 
exercise. Six aircraft have been financed through euro-denominated 12-year amortizing commercial debt 
transactions.
 Since, under each of the Company's operating leases, the Company has a commitment to maintain the relevant 
aircraft, an accounting provision is made during the lease term for this obligation based on estimated future costs of 
major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks by making appropriate charges to the income statement 
calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year. Under IFRS, the accounting 
treatment for these costs with respect to leased aircraft differs from that for aircraft owned by the Company, for 
which such costs are capitalized and amortized.
 Contractual Obligations. The table below sets forth the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the 
Company with definitive payment terms, which will require significant cash outlays in the future, as of March 31, 
2013. These obligations primarily relate to Ryanair's aircraft purchase and related financing obligations, which are 
described in more detail above. For additional information on the Company's contractual obligations and 
commercial commitments, see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.
 The amounts listed under "Finance Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its JOLCOs. See 
"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects3/4 Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 The amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table reflect obligations for aircraft purchases and are 
calculated by multiplying the number of aircraft the Company is obligated to purchase under its current agreements 
with Boeing during the relevant period by the Basic Price for each aircraft pursuant to the relevant contract, with the 
dollar-denominated Basic Price being converted into euro at an exchange rate of $1.2805=EUR1.00 (based on the 
European Central Bank Rate on March 31, 2013). The relevant amounts therefore exclude the effect of the price 
concessions granted to Ryanair by Boeing and CFM, as well as any application of the Escalation Factor described 
below. As a result, Ryanair's actual expenditures for aircraft during the relevant periods will be lower than the 
amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table.
 With respect to purchase obligations under the terms of the 2013 Boeing contract, the Company was required to 
pay Boeing 1% of the Basic Price of each of the 175 firm-order Boeing 737-800 aircraft at the time the contract was 
signed in April 2013 (such deposit being fully refundable if the Company had not received the shareholder approval 
it received at an extraordinary general meeting on June 18, 2013), and will be required to make periodic advance 
payments of the purchase price for each aircraft it has agreed to purchase during the course of the two-year period 
preceding the delivery of each aircraft. As a result of these required advance payments, the Company will have paid 
up to 30% of the Basic Price of each aircraft prior to its delivery (including the addition of an estimated "Escalation 
Factor" but before deduction of any credit memoranda and other concessions); the balance of the net price is due 
at the time of delivery. Similar terms applied under the 2005 Boeing contract, with the first payment due when the 
contract was signed in February 2005.
 The amounts listed under "Operating Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its aircraft 
operating lease arrangements.

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS
 Ryanair uses certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, including 
financial guarantees and operating lease commitments. Details of each of these arrangements that have or 
are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition, 
results of operations, liquidity or capital resources are discussed below.

at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 and, as regards the consolidated financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  They are also responsible for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
 The directors are responsible for the maintenance of integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company's website. Legislation in the Republic of Ireland governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc
 We have audited the consolidated and Company financial statements ("financial statements") of Ryanair 
Holdings plc for the year ended March 31, 2013, which comprise the consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Company statements of changes in shareholders' equity, the consolidated and Company 
statements of cash flows and the related notes.  The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is Irish law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU), and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012.
 This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 193 of the 
Companies Act, 1990 and in respect of the separate opinion in relation to International Financial 
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), on terms that have 
been agreed.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and in respect of the separate opinion in 
relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB, those matters that we have agreed to state to them in our report, 
and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
 Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
 As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities on pages 28 and 29 the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements giving a true and fair view.  Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with Irish law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the 
Ethical Standards for Auditors issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
 Scope of the audit of the financial statements
 An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the company circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements.  In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our 
report.
 Opinion on financial statements
 In our opinion:
 --      the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group's affairs as at 31 March 2013 and of its profit for the year 
then ended;
 --      the Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012, of the state 
of the Company's affairs as at 31 March 2013; and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -10-
 --      the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 
to 2012 and as regards the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc (continued)
 Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
 As explained in Note 1 on page 150 of the consolidated financial statements, the Group, in addition to 
complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, has also prepared its 
consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB, of the state of the Group's affairs as at March 31, 2013 and of its profit for the 
year then ended.
 Matters on which we are required to report by the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012
 We have obtained all the information and explanations which we consider necessary for the purposes of our 
audit.
 The Company balance sheet is in agreement with the books of account and, in our opinion, proper books of 
account have been kept by the Company.
 In our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the financial statements 
and the description in the Corporate Governance Statement of the main features of the internal control and 
risk management systems in relation to the process for preparing the consolidated financial statements is 
consistent with the consolidated financial statements.
 The net assets of the Company, as stated in the Company balance sheet are more than half of the amount of 
its called-up share capital and, in our opinion, on that basis there did not exist at 31 March 2013 a 
financial situation which under Section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983 would require the 
convening of an extraordinary general meeting of the company.
 Matters on which we are required to report by exception
 We have nothing to report in respect of the following:

Body
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related services, 
including scheduled services, internet and other related services to third parties across a European route 
network. The Company operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route 
scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to Michael O'Leary, CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). When making 
resource allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than results on individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated adjusted profit/(loss) after 
tax of the Company for the year. This measure excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, 
which are unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core 
operations, such as the impairment of a financial asset investment, accelerated depreciation related to 
aircraft disposals and Icelandic volcanic ash related costs.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and, as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, inter-segment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset class comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly 
employed across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable 
segment operations.   In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets 
and liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis for the segment profit 
or loss since the prior year.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

(a)           The exceptional item in the prior year, fiscal year 2012, relates to a one-off release of 
ticket sales revenue of EUR57.8 million, net of tax, due to a change in accounting estimates relating to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -81-
the timing of revenue recognition for unused passenger tickets which was made as a result of the 
availability of more accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.
 (b)           Icelandic volcanic ash related costs of EUR26.1 million reflect the estimated costs 
relating to the closure of airspace in April and May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions. 
The closure of European airspace in April and May 2010, due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruption, 
resulted in the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights. The impact on the Group's operating results totaled 
EUR29.7 million, (before associated tax of EUR3.6 million) for the year ended March 31, 2011, comprising 
EUR15.6 million of operating expenses and EUR1.7 million of finance expenses attributable to the period of 
flight disruption, together with estimated passenger compensation costs of EUR12.4 million pursuant to 
Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 ('EU261'). The Company's estimate of total passenger compensation costs has 
been determined based on actual claims received and processed to date together with probable future 
compensation payments and other related costs.

At March 31, 2013, aircraft with a net book value of EUR4,663.0 million (2012: EUR4,856.0 million; 2011: 
EUR4,718.7 million) were mortgaged to lenders as security for loans. Under the security arrangements for 
the Company's new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, the Company does not hold legal title to 
those aircraft while these loan amounts remain outstanding.
 At March 31, 2013, the cost and net book value of aircraft did not include any amount relating to advance 
payments on aircraft (2012: EUR110.5 million; 2011: EUR194.2 million).  Such amounts, where present, are 
not depreciated. The cost and net book value also includes capitalised aircraft maintenance, aircraft 
simulators and the stock of rotable spare parts.
 The net book value of assets held under finance leases at March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was EUR582.9

 =====  =====  =====
Landing slots were acquired with the acquisition of Buzz Stansted Limited in April 2003. As these landing 
slots have no expiry date and are expected to be used in perpetuity, they are considered to be of 
indefinite life and accordingly are not amortised. The Company also considers that there has been no 
impairment of the value of these rights to date. The recoverable amount of these rights has been 
determined on a value-in-use basis, using discounted cash-flow projections for a twenty-year period for 
each route that has an individual landing right. The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the 
operating margin and discount rate assumptions. Operating margins are based on the existing margins 
generated from these routes and adjusted for any known trading conditions. The trading environment is 
subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the operating 
performance of the business. Foreseeable events, however, are unlikely to result in a change of 
projections of a significant nature so as to result in the landing rights' carrying amounts exceeding 
their recoverable amounts. These projections have been discounted based on the estimated discount rate 
applicable to the asset of 7.0% for 2013, 7.7% for 2012 and 7.3% for 2011.

 ======  ======  ======
As at March 31, 2013 Ryanair's total percentage shareholding in Aer Lingus was 29.8% (2012: 29.8%; 2011: 
29.8%). The balance sheet value of EUR221.2 million (2012: EUR149.7 million; 2011: EUR114.0 million) reflects 
the market value of this investment as at March 31, 2013. In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, this 
asset is held at fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income following initial 
acquisition. Any impairment losses that arise are recognised in the income statement and are not subsequently 
reversed.  Any cumulative loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income 
statement once an impairment is considered to have occurred.
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR149.7 million at March 31, 2012 to EUR221.2 
million at March 31, 2013 is comprised of a gain of EUR71.5 million, recognised through other comprehensive 
income, reflecting the increase in the share price of Aer Lingus from EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012 to 
approximately EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013.  The investment in Aer Lingus has in prior periods been 
impaired to EUR0.50 per share.
 This investment is classified as available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate, because the 
Company does not have the power to exercise any influence over the entity. The Company's determination that it 
does not have any influence over Aer Lingus through its minority shareholding has been based on the following 
factors, in particular:

Body
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, foreign 
currency forward contracts and commodity contracts. These derivative financial instruments are generally held to 
maturity. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of hedging its operational and balance sheet 
risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot 
be neutralised completely.
 Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative 
financial instruments continue to be re-measured to fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described 
below.
 The fair value of interest rate swaps is computed by discounting the projected cash flows on the Company's swap 
arrangements to present value using an appropriate market rate of interest. The fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts and commodity contracts is determined based on the present value of the quoted forward price. 
Recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
 Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income (in the cash flow hedging reserve on the balance 
sheet). When the hedged forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income and included in the initial measurement of 
that asset or liability. Otherwise the cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of any hedging 
transaction and the gain or loss thereon is recognised in the income statement immediately.
 When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the underlying hedged transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is 
recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is 
recognised in the income statement immediately.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -65-
 Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an 
unrecognised firm commitment, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement. 
The hedged item is also stated at fair value in respect of the risk being hedged, with any gain or loss also being 
recognised in the income statement.
 Inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on invoiced price on an average 
basis for all stock categories. Net realisable value is calculated as the estimated selling price arising in the ordinary 
course of business, net of estimated selling costs.
 Trade and other receivables and payables
 Trade and other receivables and payables are stated on initial recognition at fair value plus any incremental direct 
costs and subsequently at amortised cost, net (in the case of receivables) of any impairment losses, which 
approximates fair value given the short-dated nature of these assets and liabilities.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash represents cash held at banks and available on demand, and is categorised for measurement purposes as 
"loans and receivables."
 Cash equivalents are current asset investments (other than cash) that are readily convertible into known amounts 
of cash, typically cash deposits of more than one day but less than three months at the date of purchase. Deposits 
with maturities greater than three months are recognised as short-term investments, are categorised as loans and 
receivables and are carried initially at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective-
interest method.
 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
 All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest-bearing loans are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.
 Leases
 Leases under which the Company assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet, at an amount equal to the 
lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated over their 
estimated useful lives. The present values of the future lease payments are recorded as obligations under finance 
leases and the interest element of a lease obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the 
lease in proportion to the balances outstanding.
 Other leases are operating leases and the associated leased assets are not recognised on the Company's balance 
sheet. Expenditure arising under operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred. The Company 
also enters into sale-and-leaseback transactions whereby it sells the rights to an aircraft to an external party and 
subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of an operating lease. Any profit or loss on the disposal where the 
price achieved is not considered to be at fair value is spread over the period during which the asset is expected to 
be used. The profit or loss amount deferred is included within "other creditors" and divided into components of 
greater than and less than one year.
 Provisions and contingencies
 A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation. If the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future outflow at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
 The Company assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to contingencies, including legal matters, as well 
as probable losses. We record provisions for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred 
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of 
the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured 
with reasonable reliability. Provisions are re-measured at each balance sheet date based on the best estimate of 
the settlement amount.
 In relation to legal matters, we develop estimates in consultation with internal and external legal counsel taking into 
account the relevant facts and circumstances known to us. The factors that we consider in developing our legal 
provisions include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and number of other similar current and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -65-
past litigation cases, the nature of the subject matter of the litigation, the likelihood of settlement and current state of 
settlement discussions, if any.
 Segment reporting
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal organisational and management 
structure and the internal reporting information provided to the chief operating decision maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments. The Company is managed as a single 
business unit that provides low fares airline-related services, including scheduled services, and ancillary services 
including car hire services, and internet and other related services to third parties, across a European route 
network.
 Income statement classification and presentation
 Individual income statement captions have been presented on the face of the income statement, together with 
additional line items, headings and sub-totals, where it is determined that such presentation is relevant to an 
understanding of our financial performance, in accordance with IAS 1, "Presentation of Financial Statements".
 Expenses are classified and presented in accordance with the nature-of-expenses method. We disclose separately 
on the face of the income statement, within other income and expense, losses on the impairment of available-for-
sale financial assets and gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment. The nature of the 
Company's available-for-sale asset is that of a financial investment; accordingly any impairment of the investment is 
categorised as finance expense and included in other income/(expense) as a separate line item. The presentation 
of gains or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment within other income/(expense) accords with 
industry practice.
 Revenues
 Scheduled revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline and other services, net of government taxes. Revenue 
from the sale of flight seats is recognised in the period in which the service is provided. Unearned revenue 
represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and a provision for government tax refund claims attributable to 
unused tickets, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Revenue, net of government taxes, is 
released to the income statement as passengers fly. Unused tickets are recognised as revenue on a systematic 
basis, such that twelve months of time expired revenues are recognised in revenue in each fiscal year. 
Miscellaneous fees charged for any changes to flight tickets are recognised in revenue immediately.

 ============  ============
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, in the 
context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents the underlying business more 
accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typicallyanalyse the results. Any amounts deemed 
"exceptional" for management discussion and analysis purposes, in the Chairman's Report and Chief Executive's 
Report, have been classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non-exceptional 
amounts of the same nature.
 There were no exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2013.
 Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2012 relate to a one-off release of ticket sales revenue of EUR57.8 
million, net of tax, due to a change in accounting estimates arising from enhancements to our Revenue Accounting 
System.
 Profit after tax increased by 13% to EUR569.3 million compared to adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional 
items of EUR502.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2012. Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the 
year increased by 2% from EUR560.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to a profit of EUR569.3 
million in the year ended March 31, 2013.
 Summary year ended March 31, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 13% to EUR569.3 million compared to EUR502.6 million in the year ended March 31, 
2012 primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by an 18% increase in 
fuel costs. Total operating revenues increased by 13% to EUR4,884.0 million as average fares rose by 6%. 
Ancillary revenues grew by 20%, faster than the 5% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR1,064.2 million due to 
a combination of improved product mix and the roll out of reserved seating across the network. Total revenue per 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -3-
passenger, as a result, increased by 8%, whilst Load Factor remained flat at 82% compared to the year ended 
March 31, 2012.
 Total operating expenses increased by 12% to EUR4,165.8 million, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, the 
higher level of activity,  operating costs associated with the growth of the airline, and the strength of UK pounds 
sterling to the euro. Fuel, which represents 45% of total operating costs compared to 43% in the prior year, 
increased by 18% to EUR1,885.6 million due to the higher price per gallon paid and increased activity in the year.  
Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 3%, including fuel cost per passenger ("unit costs")  rose by 8%.  Operating 
margin increased by 1 point to 15% whilst operating profit increased by 16% to EUR718.2 million.
 Net margin remained flat at 12%, compared to March 31, 2012.
 Basic earnings per share for the year were 39.45 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 34.10 euro 
cent at March 31, 2012.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -77-
(e)           Equity risk
 The Company has exposure to equity price risk primarily in relation to its 29.8% investment in Aer 
Lingus. The Company does not have significant influence over Aer Lingus and accordingly, this investment 
is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset rather than an investment in an associate. 
Additional information in relation to the available-for-sale financial asset can be found in Note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 (f)            Credit risk
 The Company holds significant cash balances, which are invested on a short-term basis and are classified 
as either cash equivalents or liquid investments. These deposits and other financial instruments 
(principally certain derivatives and loans as identified above) give rise to credit risk on amounts due 
from counterparties. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to 
any one counterparty through regular review of counterparties' market-based ratings, Tier 1 capital level 
and credit default swap rates and by taking into account bank counterparties' systemic importance to the 
financial systems of their home countries. The Company typically enters into deposits and derivative 
contracts with parties that have a long term Standard and Poors "A" category rating or equivalent credit 
rating. The maximum exposure arising in the event of default on the part of the counterparty is the 
carrying value of the relevant financial instrument. The Company is authorised to place funds on deposit 
for periods up to 18 months. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital as well as the level of 
dividends to ordinary shareholders on an ongoing basis.
 The Company's revenues derive principally from airline travel on scheduled services, internet income and 
in-flight and related sales. Revenue is primarily derived from European routes. No individual customer 
accounts for a significant portion of total revenue.
 At March 31, 2013, EUR1.1 million (2012: EUR1.0 million; 2011: EUR0.7 million) of our total accounts 
receivable balance were past due, of which EUR0.1 million (2012: EUR0.1 million; 2011: EUR0.1 million) was 
impaired and provided for and EUR1.0 million (2012: EUR0.9 million; 2011: EUR0.6 million) was past due but 
not impaired. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
 (g)           Liquidity and capital management
 The Company's cash and liquid resources comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and 
restricted cash. The Company defines the capital that it manages as the Company's long-term debt and 
equity. The Company's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and 
market confidence and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen 
events.
 The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from 
operations and bank loans for the acquisition of aircraft. The Company had cash and liquid resources at 
March 31, 2013 of EUR3,559.0 million (2012: EUR3,515.6 million; 2011: EUR2,940.6 million). During the 
year, the Company funded EUR310.7 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment (2012: EUR317.6 
million;  2011: EUR897.2 million). Cash generated from operations has been the principal source for these 
cash requirements, supplemented primarily by aircraft-related financing structures.
 The Board of Directors periodically reviews the capital structure of the Company, considering the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Board approves any material adjustments 
to the capital structure in terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity.
 Ryanair has generally been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft 
acquisition-related working capital requirements. Management believes that the working capital available 
to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated 
requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the 2014 fiscal year.
 (h)           Guarantees
 Details of the Company's guarantees and the related accounting have been disclosed in Note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 (i)            Sensitivity analysis
 (i)            Interest rate risk: Based on the levels of and composition of year-end interest bearing 
assets and liabilities, including derivatives, at March 31, 2013, a plus or minus one-percentage-point 
movement in interest rates would result in a respective increase or decrease of EUR18.3 million (net of 
tax) in net interest income and expense in the income statement (2012: EUR18.3 million; 2011: EUR10.9 
million) and EUR28.8 million in equity. All of the Group's interest rate swaps are used to swap variable 
rate debt to fixed rate debt; consequently any changes in interest rates would have an equal and opposite 
income statement effect for both the interest rate swaps and the debt.
 (ii)           Foreign currency risk: A plus or minus change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange 
rates, based on outstanding foreign currency-denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at 
March 31, 2013 would have a respective positive or negative impact on the income statement of EUR2.6 
million (net of tax) (2012: EUR1.8 million; 2011: EUR3.7  million) and on equity of EUR183.1 million (net 
of tax) (2012: EUR176.3 million; 2011: EUR201.1 million).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -77-
 (iii)          Equity price risk: An increase/decrease of 10% in the Aer Lingus share price as of March 
31, 2013 would result in an increase/decrease of EUR22.1 million in the fair value of the available-for-
sale financial assets (2012: EUR15.0 million; 2011: EUR11.4 million). The increase/decrease would be 
recognised in other comprehensive income.

 Ryanair welcomed Manchester Airport Group's (MAG) purchase of Stansted Airport in March 2013.  We are in 
active discussions with MAG about a rapid traffic growth plan and we hope these talks will lead to a growth deal 
which will reverse the past 6 years of record traffic falls at Stansted, where the CAA's 'inadequate' regulatory 
regime has allowed prices to double and traffic to decline by 25% from 24m to 18m since 2007.  We believe that 
competition between airports should now deliver a better deal for Stansted users, where the CAA has repeatedly 
failed.
 Our recent firm order for 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft clears the way for Ryanair to resume strong growth in fleet, 
routes and traffic over the 5 year period from fiscal 2015 to 2019.  The fact that we have secured phased deliveries 
over this period at pricing which is "not dissimilar" to our previous (2005) order emphasises the importance of 
Ryanair's long-term commitment to, and our partnership with, Boeing.  We have set up a senior team to study the 
B737-MAX and we have tasked them with reporting back before the end of September.  Subject to reaching 
commercial terms with Boeing we would hope to finalise a follow-on order sometime before the end of this fiscal 
year but there is no certainty that an agreement can be reached by that deadline.  Ryanair's success to date has 
been built on our selection of Boeing aircraft, and while we would not rule out a second aircraft type, we are 
confident that this new 175 aircraft order will provide a basis for another 5 years of strong growth in traffic, profits 
and shareholder returns
 Our passengers
 Ryanair delivers Europe's No. 1 customer service for the benefit of our passengers, our people and our 
shareholders.  We continue to grow by delivering lower fares, better punctuality, fewer lost bags, which is why we 
receive fewer passenger complaints than any other major airline in Europe.
 Despite the current EU recession, and the spread of austerity measures, Ryanair's lowest fares continue to 
encourage passengers to travel, and more importantly to switch to Ryanair's low fares.  Ryanair beats every other 
airline on price on every flight,  every route, every day.  We have grown to carry over 79.3m passengers and IATA's 
2012 traffic statistics confirm that Ryanair carries far more international passengers than any other scheduled 
airline, making Ryanair the "world's favourite airline".  Over the past year, Ryanair welcomed 79.3m passengers 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -2-
onboard, at an average fare of just EUR48, which meant that these passengers saved over EUR7bn compared  to 
the high fares charged by our competitor's including Air France, British Airways, Easyjet and Lufthansa.
 Ryanair's growth and profitability is not based solely on price.  In addition to the lowest fares in every market last 
year, Ryanair also delivered:
--   The best punctuality        93% of flights on-time (up 2%).
--   Fewest lost bags            We lost less than 1 bag for every 3,000
 passengers carried, an improvement
 on the prior year
--   Fewest complaints           Last year we received less than 1 complaint

 --   Youngest fleet              The average age of our 305 aircraft
 at year end is approximately 4.5 years.
 --   Rapid complaint responses    Over 99% replied to within 7 days.
--   The world's greenest        Independent research confirms Ryanair
 airline                     is the world's greenest/cleanest airline.
Our people
 Over the past year average staff numbers in Ryanair rose to 9,059.  Within this number, more than 350 people 
were promoted, as our growth created new opportunities for career progression and development.  Our people 
know that they can advance their careers by taking advantage of Ryanair's commitment to promote from within 
wherever possible.  At a time when many European airlines are cutting jobs, or cutting pay (as in the case of Air 
Berlin, Iberia and SAS in recent months), Ryanair is proud of its long-standing record of job creation, pay increases 
and internal promotions and, above all, job security.
 Our shareholders
 Unlike other airlines, Ryanair continues to deliver substantial returns for shareholders.  In Ryanair our Board and 
Management team hold a significant stake in the company, which means we think and act like shareholders, 
precisely because we are significant shareholders.
 Ryanair's increased profits and rising cash reserves allowed our Board to make a second special dividend of 
EUR0.34 per share (approx. EUR492m) to shareholders in November 2012.  We have completed a further share 
buyback in June 2013 amounting to EUR177m.  As a result of our continued growth, the Board has indicated its 
intention to make a further share buyback of up to EUR223m in fiscal year 2014, as well as return of up to 
EUR600.0m to shareholders through a third special dividend and/or share buyback in fiscal year 2015 representing 
a EUR1 bn return to shareholders over a two year period.  This will bring the total Ryanair has returned to 
shareholders to more than EUR2.53bn since fiscal year 2008.
 It is a remarkable fact that having raised just EUR585m from our flotation and four secondary offers between 1997 
and 2002 Ryanair will now return almost 5 times this amount (over EUR2.5bn) to shareholders by the end of 2015.
 Ryanair continues to look for opportunities to invest our cash wisely.  While we have now finalized a firm 175 
aircraft order which will enable us to grow to 110m passengers annually by fiscal year 2019, we hope to continue to 
manage this growth in a controlled, safe and profitable manner.  Our history has shown that we only order aircraft 
when we believe that pricing will make it profitable for our shareholders to do so and we believe we have achieved 
this again with our latest order.
 Finally, I would like to sincerely thank our Chairman, my fellow Board members, our Managers and all the team at 
Ryanair for their hard work and commitment over the past year, which has helped us deliver another year of low 
fare traffic growth and record profits for the benefit of our passengers, our people and our shareholders.
 Yours sincerely,
 Michael O'Leary
 Chief Executive

11           Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Company utilises financial instruments to reduce exposures to market risks throughout its business. 
Borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments are used to finance the Company's operations. 
Derivative financial instruments are contractual agreements with a value that reflects price movements in 
an underlying asset. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally jet fuel derivatives, 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage 
commodity risks, interest rate risks and currency exposures and to achieve the desired profile of fixed 
and variable rate borrowings and leases in appropriate currencies. It is the Company's policy that no 
speculative trading in financial instruments shall take place.
 The main risks attaching to the Company's financial instruments, the Company's strategy and approach to 
managing these risks, and the details of the derivatives employed to hedge against these risks have been 
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Non-flight scheduled revenue arises from the sale of rail and bus tickets, hotel reservations, car hire 
and other sources, including excess baggage charges and administration fees, all directly attributable to 
the low-fares business.
 All of the Company's operating profit arises from low-fares airline-related activities, its only business 
segment. The major revenue earning assets of the Company are its aircraft, which are registered in Ireland 
and therefore profits accrue principally in Ireland. Since the Company's aircraft fleet is flexibly 
employed across its route network in Europe, there is no suitable basis of allocating such assets and 
related liabilities to geographical segments.

 The expected long-term rate of return on assets of 5.92% (2012: 6.15%; 2011: 6.75%) for the Irish scheme was 
calculated based on the assumptions of the following returns for each asset class: Equities 7.25% (2012: 7.50%; 
2011: 7.50%); Bonds 3.5% (2012: 4.50%; 2011: 4.50% ); Property 6.25% (2012: 6.50%; 2011: 6.25%); and Cash 
2.00% (2012: 3.00%; 2011: 3.00%). The expected long-term rate of return on assets of 6.52% (2012: 6.55%; 2011: 
7.55%) for the UK scheme was calculated based on the assumptions of the following returns for each asset class: 
Equities 7.50% (2012: 7.50%; 2011: 8.10%); Corporate and Overseas Bonds 4.40% (2012: 4.65%; 2011: 5.60%); 
and Other 2.85% (2012: 3.00%; 2011: 3.00%).
 Since there are no suitable euro-denominated AA-rated corporate bonds, the expected return is estimated by 
adding a suitable risk premium to the rate available from government bonds. The assumptions are based on long-
term expectations at the beginning of the reporting period and are expected to be relatively stable.
 The history of the plans for the current and prior periods is as follows:

 The timing of Ryanair's 2012 offer for Aer Lingus was influenced by; (i) the continued consolidation of European 
airlines, and more recently the International Airlines Group (the parent company of British Airways) takeover of 
British Midland International, where the No.1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to acquire the No. 2; (ii) the additional 
capacity available at Dublin airport following the opening of Terminal 2 and the decline in traffic from 23.3 million 
passengers per annum in 2007 to 18.7 million in 2011, resulting in Dublin airport operating at approximately 50% 
capacity; (iii) the change in the Irish government policy since 2006 in that the Irish government has decided to sell 
its stake in Aer Lingus; (iv) the fact that under the terms of the bailout agreement provided by the European 
Commission, European Central bank and International Monetary Fund to Ireland, the Irish government has 
committed to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (v) the fact that the ESOT (Employee Share Ownership Trust) which at the 
time of the unsuccessful 2006 offer controlled 15% of Aer Lingus has been disbanded since December 2010 and 
the shares distributed to the individual members, with the result that Ryanair's new offer was, in Ryanair's view, 
capable of reaching over 50% acceptance either with or without government acceptance; and (vi) the fact that 
Etihad, an Abu Dhabi based airline, has acquired a 3% stake in Aer Lingus and has expressed an interest in buying 
the Irish government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus (the offer now provides Etihad or any other potential bidder the 
opportunity to purchase the government's stake).
 Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and to grow its traffic 
from 9.5 million to over 14.5 million passengers over a five year period post acquisition, by growing Aer Lingus' 
short haul traffic at some of Europe's major airports where Aer Lingus currently operates and Ryanair does not. 
Ryanair also intended to increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic traffic from Ireland, which has fallen in recent years, by 
investing in operations. If the offer had been accepted, the Irish government would have received EUR173 million in 
cash. The offer of EUR1.30 per share represented a premium of approximately 38% over the closing price of 
EUR0.94 for Aer Lingus shares as of June 19, 2012. The offer was conditional on competition approval by the 
European Commission.
 Following the European Commission's decision to prohibit its offer for Aer Lingus, Ryanair has actively engaged 
with the Competition Commission's investigation of the minority stake. In its provisional findings on May 30, 2013, 
the UK Competition Commission (UKCC) stated that Ryanair, through its minority shareholding in Aer Lingus, "has  
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -48-
influence" over Aer Lingus, that this "could reduce competition", and that Ryanair should be required to divest some 
or all of its shares in Aer Lingus.  Following an extension of the investigation timetable on June 24, 2013, the 
UKCC's final decision will be published by September 5, 2013.  The UKCC could order Ryanair to divest some or all 
of its shares in Aer Lingus, as a result of which Ryanair could suffer losses due to the negative impact on market 
prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares. Ryanair believes that the enforcement of 
any such decision should be delayed until the outcome of Ryanair's appeal against the European Commission's 
February 2013 prohibition decision of Ryanair's 2012 offer for Aer Lingus, and the conclusion of any appeals 
against the UKCC's decision in the UK courts.  However, it is possible that the UKCC will seek to enforce any such 
sell-down remedy at an earlier date. On July 23, 2013 the Company announced that as part of its remedies 
discussions with the UKCC it had offered to give an undertaking to unconditionally sell its shareholding in Aer 
Lingus to any other EU airline that makes an offer for Aer Lingus and acquires acceptances in respect of more than 
50% of Aer Lingus' issued share capital. For more information, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial 
Information-Legal Proceedings-Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus."
 Legal Actions Against Monopoly Airports. Ryanair has been involved in a number of legal and regulatory actions 
against the Dublin and London (Stansted) airports in relation to what Ryanair considers to be ongoing abuses of 
their dominant positions in the Dublin and London (Stansted) markets. Management believes that both of these 
airports have been engaging in "regulatory gaming" in order to achieve inflated airport charges under the regulatory 
processes in the U.K. and Ireland. By inflating its so-called "regulated asset base" (essentially the value of its airport 
facilities), a regulated airport can achieve higher returns on its assets through inflated airport charges. With respect 
to London (Stansted), the OFT, following complaints from Ryanair and other airlines, has recognized that the 
regulatory process is flawed and provides perverse incentives to regulated airports to spend excessively on 
infrastructure in order to inflate their airport charges. The OFT referred the case to the Competition Commission 
which released its preliminary findings in April 2008. It found that the common ownership by BAA of the three main 
airports in London affects competition and that the "light touch" regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority was having 
an adverse impact on competition. In March 2009, the Competition Commission published its final report on the 
BAA and ordered the breakup of the BAA, (which involved the sale of London (Gatwick) and London (Stansted) and 
either Glasgow or Edinburgh Airport in Scotland). In October 2009, London (Gatwick) was sold to Global 
Infrastructure Partners for GBP1.5 billion. In May 2009, BAA appealed the Competition Commission's decision on 
the bases of apparent bias and lack of proportionality. Ryanair secured the right to intervene in this appeal in 
support of the Competition Commission. The case was heard in October 2009 and in February 2010 the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal quashed the Competition Commission's ruling on the basis of the "apparent bias" 
claim. This decision was successfully appealed by both the Competition Commission and Ryanair before the Court 
of Appeal. The appeal was heard in June 2010 and the judgment was issued in October 2010, quashing the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal ruling and reinstating the Competition Commission March 2009 decision. In February 
2011, the Supreme Court refused to grant the BAA permission to appeal the Court of Appeal ruling. The 
Competition Commission has subsequently reconsidered the appropriateness of the remedies imposed on the BAA 
in March 2009 in light of the passage of time, and confirmed in its preliminary report in April 2011 that the remedies 
are still appropriate and the sale of Stansted and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports should proceed. In 
July 2011, the Competition Commission confirmed its March 2011 provisional decision on "possible material 
changes of circumstances." It found that no material changes of circumstances (that would necessitate a change in 
the remedies package) had occurred since the March 2009 decision requiring the BAA to sell Gatwick, Stansted 
and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports, and that consequently the BAA should proceed to dispose of 
Stansted and one of the Scottish airports. The BAA appealed this decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and 
lost on February 1, 2012. The BAA then brought a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, which they also lost on 
July 26, 2012. While these appeals were ongoing, the BAA proceeded to sell Edinburgh airport in April 2012. BAA 
did not appeal the Court of Appeal judgment to the UK Supreme Court, and proceeded to complete the sale of 
Stansted airport to Manchester Airports Group plc in March 2013.
 With respect to Dublin airport, Ryanair appealed the December 2009 decision of the CAR, which set maximum 
charges at the airport for 2010 through 2014, to the Appeals Panel set up by the Minister for Transport. In June 
2010, the Appeals Panel found in favor of Ryanair on the matter of differential pricing between Terminal 1 and 
Terminal 2, recommending that such differential pricing be imposed by the CAR. The CAR subsequently overruled 
the decision of the Appeals panel and allowed the charges increase at Dublin Airport, with no differential pricing 
between Terminals 1 and 2.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -48-
 Ryanair has also been trying to prevent both the BAA in London and the DAA in Dublin from engaging in wasteful 
capital expenditure. In the case of London (Stansted) Airport, the BAA was planning to spend GBP4 billion on a 
second runway and terminal, which Ryanair believes should only cost approximately GBP1 billion. Following the 
final decision of the Competition Commission forcing BAA to sell London (Stansted) airport, Ryanair believed that it 
was highly unlikely that BAA's planned GBP4 billion plans would proceed. The  Liberal/Conservative government in 
the U.K. had also outlined that it would not approve the building of any more runways in the Southeast of England. 
Consequently, in May 2010, the BAA announced that it would not pursue its plans to develop a second runway at 
London (Stansted).

 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair made a third offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own at a 
price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share.  The timing of the offer was influenced by: (i) the continued consolidation of 
European airlines, and more recently the International Airlines Group (the parent company of British Airways) 
takeover of British Midland International, where the No.1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to acquire the No. 2; (ii) 
the additional capacity available at Dublin airport following the opening of Terminal 2 and the decline in traffic from 
23.3 million passengers per annum in 2007 to 18.7 million in 2011, has resulted in Dublin airport operating at 
approximately 50% capacity; (iii) the change in the Irish government policy since 2006 in that the Irish government 
has decided to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (iv) the fact that under the terms of the bailout agreement provided by 
the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to Ireland, the Irish 
government has committed to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (v) the fact that the ESOT (Employee Share Ownership 
Trust) which at the time of the unsuccessful 2006 offer controlled 15% of Aer Lingus, has been disbanded since 
December 2010 and the shares distributed to the individual members, with the result that Ryanair's new offer was, 
in Ryanair's view, capable of reaching over 50% acceptance either with or without government acceptance; and (vi) 
the fact that recently Etihad, an Abu Dhabi based airline, has acquired a 3% stake in Aer Lingus and has expressed 
an interest in buying the government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus (the offer therefore provided Etihad or any other 
potential bidder the opportunity to purchase the government's stake).
 Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and to grow its traffic 
from 9.5 million to over 14.5 million passengers over a five year period post acquisition, by growing Aer Lingus' 
short haul traffic at some of Europe's major airports where Aer Lingus currently operates and Ryanair does not. 
Ryanair also intended to increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic traffic from Ireland, which has fallen in recent years, by 
investing in operations. If the offer was accepted, the Irish government would have received EUR173 million in 
cash. The offer of EUR1.30 per share represented a premium of approximately 38% over the closing price of 
EUR0.94 for Aer Lingus shares as of June 19, 2012. The offer was conditional on competition approval by the 
European Commission. However, on February 27, 2013, the European Commission prohibited the acquisition by 
Ryanair of the remaining share capital of Aer Lingus. Ryanair appealed this prohibition to the EU General Court on 
May 8, 2013. A judgment in this appeal is expected within 18-24 months of the date of filing.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -34-
 The available for sale financial asset balance sheet value of EUR221.2 million reflects the market value of the 
Company's stake in Aer Lingus as of March 31, 2013, as compared to a value of EUR149.7 million as of March 31, 
2012. In accordance with the company's accounting policy, this investment is held at fair value. This investment is 
classified as available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate, because the Company does not have 
the power to exercise any influence over Aer Lingus. The increase in the amount of the available for sale financial 
asset from EUR149.7 million at March 31, 2012 to EUR221.2 million at March 31, 2013 is comprised of a gain of 
EUR71.5 million, recognized through other comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in Aer Lingus' share 
price from EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012 to EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013. All impairment losses 
are required to be recognized in the income statement and are not subsequently reversed, while gains are 
recognized through other comprehensive income.  The investment had in prior periods been impaired to EUR0.50 
per share.  In fiscal year 2010, the Company recorded an impairment charge of EUR13.5 million in the income 
statement on its Aer Lingus shareholding.
 The Company's determination that it does not have control, or even exercise a "significant influence," over Aer 
Lingus through its minority shareholding has been based on the following factors:
 (i) Ryanair does not have any representation on the Aer Lingus Board of Directors; nor does it have a right to 
appoint a director;
 (ii) Ryanair does not participate in Aer Lingus policy-making decisions; nor does it have a right to participate in 
such policy-making decisions;
 (iii) There are no material transactions between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, there is no interchange of personnel 
between the two companies and there is no sharing of technical information between the companies;
 (iv) Aer Lingus and its significant shareholder (the Irish government: 25.1%) have historically openly opposed 
Ryanair's investment or participation in the company;
 (v) In 2007, 2009 and 2010, Aer Lingus refused Ryanair's attempt to assert its statutory right to requisition a 
general meeting (a legal right of any 5% shareholder under Irish law).
 (vi) On April 15, 2011, the High Court in Dublin ruled that Aer Lingus was not obliged to accede to Ryanair's 
request that two additional resolutions (on the payment of a dividend and on payments to pension schemes) be put 
to vote at Aer Lingus' annual general meeting; and
 (vii) The European Commission has formally found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus does not grant 
Ryanair "de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus" and that "Ryanair's rights as a minority shareholder...are 
associated exclusively to rights related to the protection of minority shareholders" (Commission Decision Case No. 
COMP/M.4439 dated October 11, 2007).The European Commission's finding has been confirmed by the European 
Union's General Court which issued a decision on July 6, 2010 that the European Commission was justified to use 
the required legal and factual standard in its refusal to order Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding in Aer 
Lingus and that, as part of that decision, Ryanair's shareholding did not confer control of Aer Lingus (Judgment of 
the General Court (Third Chamber) Case No. T-411/07 dated July 6, 2010).
 Historical Results Are Not Predictive of Future Results
 The historical results of operations discussed herein may not be indicative of Ryanair's future operating 
performance. Ryanair's future results of operations will be affected by, among other things, overall passenger traffic 
volume; the availability of new airports for expansion; fuel prices; the airline pricing environment in a period of 
increased competition; the ability of Ryanair to finance its planned acquisition of aircraft and to discharge the 
resulting debt service obligations; economic and political conditions in Ireland, the U.K. and the EU; terrorist threats 
or attacks within the EU; seasonal variations in travel; developments in government regulations, litigation and labor 
relations; foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of the banking crisis and potential break-up of the euro; 
competition and the public's perception regarding the safety of low-fares airlines; the value of its equity stake in Aer 
Lingus; changes in aircraft acquisition, leasing, and other operating costs; flight interruptions caused by volcanic 
ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions; flight disruptions caused by periodic and prolonged air traffic 
controller strikes in Europe; the rates of income and corporate taxes paid, and the impact of the financial and 
Eurozone crisis. Ryanair expects its depreciation, staff and fuel charges to increase as additional aircraft and 
related flight equipment are acquired. Future fuel costs may also increase as a result of the depletion of petroleum 
reserves, the shortage of fuel production capacity and/or production restrictions imposed by fuel oil producers. 
Maintenance expenses may also increase as a result of Ryanair's fleet expansion and replacement program. In 
addition, the financing of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft will increase the total amount of the Company's outstanding 
debt and the payments it is obliged to make to service such debt. The cost of insurance coverage for certain third-
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -34-
party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or terrorism increased dramatically following the September 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks. Although Ryanair currently passes on increased insurance costs to passengers by means of a 
special "insurance levy" on each ticket, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be successful in doing so. 
See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative 
Impact on the International Airline Industry."
 RECENT OPERATING RESULTS
 The Company's profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 (the first quarter of the Company's 2014 fiscal 
year) was EUR78.1 million, as compared to EUR98.8 million for the corresponding period of the previous year. The 
Company recorded a decrease in operating profit, from EUR132.0 million in the first quarter of the 2013 fiscal year 
to EUR103.3 million in the recently completed quarter. Total operating revenues increased from EUR1,283.9 million 
in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR1,342.2 million in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in operating profit was 
primarily due to a 4% reduction in average fares and an 8% increase in total operating expenses, offset by strong 
ancillary revenues. Operating expenses increased from EUR1,151.9 million in the first quarter of 2013 to 
EUR1,238.9 million in the first quarter of 2014, due primarily to the 6% increase in fuel costs and an increase in 
other operating costs associated with a higher level of activity in line with the growth of the airline. The Company's 
cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and financial assets with terms of less than three months amounted to 
EUR3,592.7 million at June 30, 2013 as compared with EUR3,807.6 million at June 30, 2012.

 During the year ended March 31, 2012, changes in estimates relating to the timing of revenue recognition 
for unused passenger tickets were made, resulting in increased revenue of EUR65.3 million (fiscal year 
2013:Nil). This change reflects more accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.
 Ancillary revenues are recognised in the income statement in the period the ancillary services are 
provided.
 Share-based payments
 The Company engages in equity-settled, share-based payment transactions in respect of services received 
from certain of its employees. The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the 
fair value of the share options on the date of the grant. The grant measurement date is the date that a 
shared understanding of the terms of the award is established between the Company and the employee. The 
cost of the employee services received in respect of the share options granted is recognised in the income 
statement over the period that the services are received, which is the vesting period, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. To the extent that service is provided prior to the grant measurement 
date, the fair value of the share options is initially estimated and re-measured at each balance sheet 
date until the grant measurement date is achieved. The fair value of the options granted is determined 
using various option-pricing models, including binomial lattice and black-scholes, which takes into 
account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the 
expected volatility of the Ryanair Holdings plc share price over the life of the option and other relevant 
factors. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share 
options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount 
recognised in the income statement reflects the number of vested shares or share options.
 Pensions and other post-retirement obligations
 The Company provides certain employees with post-retirement benefits in the form of pensions. The Company 
operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
 Costs arising in respect of the Company's defined contribution pension schemes (where fixed contributions 
are paid into the scheme and there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts) are 
charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Any contributions unpaid at the 
balance sheet date are included as a liability.
 A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined-contribution plan. The 
liabilities and costs associated with the Company's defined benefit pension schemes are assessed on the 
basis of the projected unit credit method by professionally qualified actuaries and are arrived at using 
actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the balance sheet date. The discount rates employed 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -66-
in determining the present value of each scheme's liabilities are determined by reference to market yields 
at the balance sheet date of high quality corporate bonds in the same currency and term that is consistent 
with those of the associated pension obligations. The net surplus or deficit arising on the Company's 
defined-benefit schemes is shown within non-current assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The 
deferred tax impact of any such amount is disclosed separately within deferred tax.
 The Company separately recognises the operating and financing costs of defined-benefit pensions in the 
income statement. IFRS permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses. The 
Company has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses within other comprehensive income.
 Income taxes including deferred income taxes
 Income tax on the profit or loss for a year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised 
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income (such as certain hedging derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale assets, pensions and 
other post-retirement obligations). Current tax payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in 
the period in which the profits arise using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
 Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary 
differences arising from the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying accounts in the 
consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and legislation 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and expected to apply when the temporary 
differences reverse.
 The following temporary differences are not provided for: (i) the initial recognition of assets and 
liabilities that effect neither accounting nor taxable profit and (ii) differences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable they will not reverse in the future.
 A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that a 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be realised.
 Share capital
 Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of 
ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. When 
share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, which includes any 
directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased 
shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity, until they 
are cancelled.

Body
 The following is a discussion of certain Irish tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and 
disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs. This discussion is based upon tax laws and practice of Ireland at 
the date of this document, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Particular rules 
may apply to certain classes of taxpayers (such as dealers in securities) and this discussion does not 
purport to deal with the tax consequences of purchase, ownership or disposition of the relevant securities 
for all categories of investors.
 The discussion is intended only as a general guide based on current Irish law and practice and is not 
intended to be, nor should it be considered to be, legal or tax advice to any particular investor or 
stockholder. Accordingly, current stockholders or potential investors should satisfy themselves as to the 
overall tax consequences by consulting their own tax advisers.
 Dividends. If Ryanair Holdings pays dividends or makes other relevant distributions, the following is 
relevant:
 Withholding Tax. Unless exempted, a withholding at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%) will 
apply to dividends or other relevant distributions paid by an Irish resident company. The withholding tax 
requirement will not apply to distributions paid to certain categories of Irish resident stockholders or 
to distributions paid to certain categories of non-resident stockholders.
 The following Irish resident stockholders are exempt from withholding if they make to the Company, in 
advance of payment of any relevant distribution, an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption:
 --      Irish resident companies;
 --      Pension schemes approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners ("Irish Revenue");
 --      Qualifying fund managers or qualifying savings managers;
 --      Personal Retirement Savings Account ("PRSA") administrators who receive the relevant distribution 
as income arising in respect of PRSA assets;
 --      Qualifying employee share ownership trusts;
 --      Collective investment undertakings;
 --      Tax-exempt charities;
 --      Designated brokers receiving the distribution for special portfolio investment accounts;
 --      Any person who is entitled to exemption from income tax under Schedule F on dividends in respect 
of an investment in whole or in part of payments received in respect of a civil action or from the 
Personal Injuries Assessment Board for damages in respect of mental or physical infirmity;
 --      Certain qualifying trusts established for the benefit of an incapacitated individual and/or 
persons in receipt of income from such a qualifying trust;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -54-
 --      Any person entitled to exemption to income tax under Schedule F by virtue of Section 192(2) Taxes 
Consolidation Act ("TCA") 1997;
 --      Unit trusts to which Section 731(5)(a) TCA 1997 applies; and
 --      Certain Irish Revenue-approved amateur and athletic sport bodies.
 The following non-resident stockholders are exempt from withholding if they make to the Company, in 
advance of payment of any dividend, an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption:
 --      Persons (other than a company) who (i) are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland 
and (ii) are resident for tax purposes in (a) a country which has signed a tax treaty with Ireland (a "tax 
treaty country") or (b) an EU member state other than Ireland;
 --      Companies not resident in Ireland which are resident in an EU member state or a tax treaty 
country, by virtue of the law of an EU member state or a tax treaty country and are not controlled, 
directly or indirectly, by Irish residents;
 --      Companies not resident in Ireland which are directly or indirectly controlled by a person or 
persons who are, by virtue of the law of a tax treaty country or an EU member state, resident for tax 
purposes in a tax treaty country or an EU member state other than Ireland and which are not controlled 
directly or indirectly by persons who are not resident for tax purposes in a tax treaty country or EU 
member state;
 --      Companies not resident in Ireland the principal class of shares of which is substantially and 
regularly traded on a recognized stock exchange in a tax treaty country or an EU member state including 
Ireland or on an approved stock exchange; or
 --      Companies not resident in Ireland that are 75% subsidiaries of a single company, or are wholly-
owned by two or more companies, in either case the principal classes of shares of which is or are 
substantially and regularly traded on a recognized stock exchange in a tax treaty country or an EU member 
state including Ireland or on an approved stock exchange.
 In the case of an individual non-resident stockholder resident in an EU member state or tax treaty 
country, the declaration must be accompanied by a current certificate of tax residence from the tax 
authorities in the stockholder's country of residence. In the case of both an individual and corporate 
non-resident stockholder resident in an EU member state or tax treaty country the declaration also must 
contain an undertaking by the individual or corporate non-resident stockholder that he, she or it will 
advise the Company accordingly if he, she or it ceases to meet the conditions to be entitled to the DWT 
exemption. No declaration is required if the stockholder is a 5% parent company in another EU member state 
in accordance with section 831 TCA 1997. Neither is a declaration required on the payment by a company 
resident in Ireland to another company so resident if the company making the dividend is a 51% subsidiary 
of that other company.
 American Depositary Receipts.Special arrangements with regard to the dividend withholding tax obligation 
apply in the case of Irish companies using ADRs through U.S. depositary banks that have been authorized by 
the Irish Revenue. Such banks, which receive dividends from the company and pass them on to the U.S. ADS 
holders beneficially entitled to such dividends, will be allowed to receive and pass on the gross 
dividends (i.e., before withholding) based on an "address system" where the recorded addresses of such 
holder, as listed in the depositary bank's register of depositary receipts, is in the United States.
 Taxation on Dividends. Companies resident in Ireland other than those taxable on receipt of dividends as 
trading income are exempt from corporation tax on distributions received on Ordinary Shares from other 
Irish resident companies. Stockholders that are "close" companies for Irish taxation purposes may, 
however, be subject to a 20% corporation tax surcharge on undistributed investment income.
 Individual stockholders who are resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland are subject to income tax on 
the gross dividend at their marginal tax rate, but are entitled to a credit for the tax withheld by the 
company paying the dividend. The dividend will also be subject to the universal social charge. An 
individual stockholder who is not liable or not fully liable for income tax by reason of exemption or 
otherwise may be entitled to receive an appropriate refund of tax withheld. A charge to Irish social 
security taxes can also arise for such individuals on the amount of any dividend received from the 
Company.
 Except in certain circumstances, a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and 
is entitled to receive dividends without deductions is not liable for Irish tax on the dividends. Where a 
person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland is subject to withholding tax on the 
dividend received due to not benefiting from any exemption from such withholding, the amount of that 
withholding will generally satisfy such person's liability for Irish tax.
 Capital Gains Tax. A person who is either resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland will generally be 
liable for Irish capital gains tax on any gain realized on the disposal of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs. 
The current capital gains tax rate is 33%. A person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in 
Ireland and who does not carry on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency will not be subject to 
Irish capital gains tax on the disposal of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -54-
 Irish Capital Acquisitions Tax.A gift or inheritance of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be within the 
charge to Irish Capital Acquisitions Tax ("CAT") notwithstanding that the donor or the donee/successor in 
relation to such gift or inheritance is resident outside Ireland. CAT is charged at a rate of 33% above a 
tax-free threshold. This tax-free threshold is determined by the amount of the current benefit and of 
previous benefits taken since December 5, 1991, as relevant, within the charge to CAT and the relationship 
between the donor and the successor or donee. Gifts and inheritances between spouses (and in certain cases 
former spouses) are not subject to CAT.
 In a case where an inheritance or gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs is subject to both Irish CAT and 
foreign tax of a similar character, the foreign tax paid may in certain circumstances be credited in whole 
or in part against the Irish tax.

21     Pensions
 The Company accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, "Employee Benefits."
 The Company operates defined-benefit and defined-contribution schemes.
 Defined-benefit schemes
 The Company funds the pension entitlements of certain employees through defined-benefit plans. Two plans 
are operated for eligible Irish and UK employees.  The UK and Irish schemes were closed to new entrants on 
January 1, 2000.  In general, on retirement, a member is entitled to a pension calculated at 1/60th of the 
final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years. These 
plans are fully funded on a discontinuance basis and the related pension costs and liabilities are 
assessed in accordance with the advice of a professionally qualified actuary. The investments of the plans 
at March 31, 2013 consisted of units held in independently administered funds. The most recent full 
actuarial valuations of the plans were carried out at January 1, 2011 in respect of the UK plan and 
December 31, 2009 in respect of the Irish plan, in accordance with local regulatory requirements using the 
projected unit credit method, and the valuation reports are not available for public inspection.
 A separate annual actuarial valuation has been performed for the purposes of preparing these financial 
statements. The principal actuarial assumptions used for the purpose of this actuarial valuation were as 
follows:

The Company uses certain mortality rate assumptions when calculating scheme liabilities. The mortality 
assumptions of the Irish scheme have been based on the mortality table 62%/70% PNM/FL00 while the mortality 
assumptions of the UK scheme have been based on the "SAPS" mortality table. Both mortality assumptions make 
allowance for future improvements in mortality rates. Retirement ages for scheme members are 60 for pilots and 65 
for other staff.
 The current life expectancies underlying the value of the scheme liabilities for the Irish scheme are as follows:

Interest rate re-pricing
 Floating interest rates on financial liabilities are generally referenced to European inter-bank interest rates 
(EURIBOR). Secured long-term debt and interest rate swaps typically re-price on a quarterly basis with finance 
leases re-pricing on a semi-annual basis. We use current interest rate settings on existing floating rate debt at each 
year-end to calculate contractual cash flows.
 Fixed interest rates on financial liabilities are fixed for the duration of the underlying structures (typically between 
10 and 12 years).
 The Company holds significant cash balances that are invested on a short-term basis. At March 31, 2013, all of the 
Company's cash and liquid resources had a maturity of one year or less and attracted a weighted average interest 
rate of 0.39% (2012: 1.07%; 2011: 0.97%).

Interest rates on cash and liquid resources are generally based on the appropriate EURIBOR, LIBOR or bank 
rates dependant on the principal amounts on deposit.
 (d)          Foreign currency risk
 The Company has exposure to various foreign currencies (principally U.K. pounds sterling and U.S. 
dollars) due to the international nature of its operations. The Company manages this risk by matching U.K. 
pound sterling revenues against U.K. pound sterling costs. Any remaining unmatched U.K. pound sterling 
revenues are used to fund U.S. dollar currency exposures that arise in relation to fuel, maintenance, 
aviation insurance and capital expenditure costs or are sold for euro. The Company also sells euro forward

to cover certain U.S. dollar costs. Further details of the hedging activity carried out by the Company are 
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
 The following table shows the net amount of monetary assets of the Company that are not denominated in 
euro at March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Such amounts have been translated using the following year-end

 Irish Stamp Duty. It is assumed for the purposes of this paragraph that ADSs are dealt in on a recognized stock 
exchange in the United States (NASDAQ is a recognized stock exchange in the United States for this purpose). 
Under current Irish law, no stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition of ADSs by persons purchasing such 
ADSs or on any subsequent transfer of ADSs. A transfer of Ordinary Shares (including transfers effected through 
Euroclear U.K. & Ireland Limited) wherever executed and whether on sale, in contemplation of a sale or by way of a 
gift, will be subject to duty at the rate of 1% of the consideration given or, in the case of a gift or if the purchase 
price is inadequate or unascertainable, on the market value of the Ordinary Shares. Transfers of Ordinary Shares 
that are not liable for duty at the rate of 1% (e.g., transfers under which there is no change in beneficial ownership) 
may be subject to a fixed duty of EUR12.50.
 The Irish Revenue treats a conversion of Ordinary Shares to ADSs made in contemplation of a sale or a change in 
beneficial ownership (under Irish law) as an event subject to stamp duty at a rate of 1%. The Irish Revenue has 
indicated that a re-conversion of ADSs to Ordinary Shares made in contemplation of a sale or a change in 
beneficial ownership (under Irish law) will not be subject to a stamp duty. However, the subsequent sale of the re-
converted Ordinary Shares will give rise to Irish stamp duty at the 1% rate. If the transfer of the Ordinary Shares is a 
transfer under which there is no change in the beneficial ownership (under Irish law) of the Ordinary Shares being 
transferred, nominal stamp duty only will be payable on the transfer. Under Irish law, it is not clear whether the mere 
deposit of Ordinary Shares for ADSs or ADSs for Ordinary Shares would be deemed to constitute a change in 
beneficial ownership. Accordingly, it is possible that holders would be subject to stamp duty at the 1% rate when 
merely depositing Ordinary Shares for ADSs or ADSs for Ordinary Shares and, consequently, the Depositary 
reserves the right in such circumstances to require payment of stamp duty at the rate of 1% from the holders.
 The person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the transferee or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift or 
for a consideration less than the market value, all parties to the transfer. Stamp duty is normally payable within 30 
days after the date of execution of the transfer. Late or inadequate payment of stamp duty will result in liability for 
interest, penalties and fines.
 United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -55-
 Except as described below under the heading "Non-U.S. Holders," the following is a summary of certain U.S. 
federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs 
by a holder that is a citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. domestic corporation or otherwise subject to 
U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs ("U.S. Holders"). This 
summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to 
a decision to purchase the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs. In particular, the summary deals only with U.S. Holders 
that will hold Ordinary Shares or ADRs as capital assets and generally does not address the tax treatment of U.S. 
Holders that may be subject to special tax rules such as banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or 
currencies, partnerships or partners therein, entities subject to the branch profits tax, traders in securities electing to 
mark to market, persons that own 10% or more of the stock of the Company, U.S. Holders whose "functional 
currency" is not U.S. dollars or persons that hold the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs as part of an integrated 
investment (including a "straddle") consisting of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs and one or more other positions.
 Holders of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. or other tax 
consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs in light of their 
particular circumstances, including, in particular, the effect of any foreign, state or local tax laws.
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of the ADRs will be treated as the owners of the Ordinary Shares 
represented by those ADRs.
 Taxation of Dividends
 U.S. Holders
 Dividends, if any, paid with respect to the Ordinary Shares, including Ordinary Shares represented by ADRs, will 
be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder when the dividends are received by the holder or the Depositary. 
Such dividends will not be eligible for the "dividends received" deduction allowed to U.S. corporations in respect of 
dividends from a domestic corporation. Dividends paid in euro will be includible in the income of a U.S. Holder in a 
U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day they are received by the holder 
or the Depositary. U.S. Holders generally should not be required to recognize any foreign currency gain or loss to 
the extent such dividends paid in Euro are converted into U.S. dollars immediately upon receipt.
 Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by 
an individual post January 1, 2013 with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will be subject to taxation at a 
maximum rate of 20% (15% prior to January 1, 2013) if the dividends are "qualified dividends." Dividends paid on 
the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the issuer is eligible for the benefits of a 
comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the Internal Revenue Service has approved for the 
purposes of the qualified dividend rules and (ii) the Company was not, in the year prior to the year in which the 
dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (a 
"PFIC"). The income tax treaty between Ireland and the United States has been approved for the purposes of the 
qualified dividend rules. Effective January 1, 2013, a Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% is also applicable to U.S. 
individuals, estates and trusts. Based on the Company's audited financial statements and relevant market data, the 
Company believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2011/12 
taxable year. In addition, based on the Company's audited financial statements and its current expectations 
regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market data, the 
Company does not anticipate becoming a PFIC for its 2013/14 taxable year.
 Under the U.S.-Ireland Income Tax Treaty currently in effect, in the event the Company were to pay any dividend, 
the tax credit attaching to the dividend (as used herein the "Tax Credit"; see "-Irish Tax Considerations") generally 
will be treated as a foreign income tax eligible for credit against such U.S. Holder's United States federal income tax 
liability, subject to generally applicable limitations and conditions. Any such dividend paid by the Company to such 
U.S. Holder will constitute income from sources outside the United States for foreign tax credit purposes, and 
generally will constitute "passive category" income for such purposes.
 Foreign tax credits may not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged 
positions in securities.
 U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the implications of these rules in light of their 
particular circumstances.
 Distributions of Ordinary Shares that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all stockholders generally will not 
be subject to U.S. federal income tax.
 Taxation of Capital Gains
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -55-
 Sale or Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs. Gains or losses realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other 
disposition of ADRs generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as capital gains or losses, which 
generally will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADRs have been held for more than one year. The net 
amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder post January 1, 2013 generally is subject to 
taxation at a maximum rate of 20% (15% prior to January 1, 2013). Effective January 1, 2013, a Medicare 
contribution tax of 3.8% is also applicable to U.S. individuals, estates and trusts. The deductibility of capital losses 
is subject to limitations.
 Deposits and withdrawals of Ordinary Shares by U.S. Holders in exchange for ADRs will not result in the realization 
of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 Non-U.S. Holders. A holder of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, with respect to the United States, a foreign 
corporation or a nonresident alien individual (a "Non-U.S. Holder") generally will not be subject to U.S. federal 
income or withholding tax on dividends received on such Ordinary Shares or ADRs unless such income is 
effectively connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States. A Non-U.S. 
Holder of ADRs or Ordinary Shares will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax in respect of 
gain realized on the sale or other disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless (i) such gain is effectively 
connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) in the case of gain 
realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, such Non-U.S. Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or 
more in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are met.

(a)    Additional information in relation to the above interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts 
(i.e. notional value and weighted average interest rates) can be found in Note 11 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
 (b)   EUR31.8 million interest rate swap financial liabilities falling due within one year, includes 
EUR5.2 million derivative financial liabilities, falling due within one year, in respect of cross currency 
interest rate swaps (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
 (c)    EUR35.8 million commodity forward contracts falling due within one year, includes EUR35.0 million 
jet fuel derivative financial assets and EUR0.8 million carbon swap financial asset (see Note 11 of the 
consolidated financial statements).
 Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of the Company's floating rate exposures on 
borrowings and operating leases into fixed rate exposures and are set so as to match exactly the critical 
terms of the underlying debt or lease being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest rate settings, re-
pricing dates). These are all classified as cash-flow hedges of the forecasted variable interest payments 
and rentals due on the Company's underlying debt and operating leases and have been determined to be 
highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness has been recorded in 
the income statement relating to these hedges in the current and preceding years.
 The Company also utilises cross currency interest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in 
foreign exchange rates of U.S. dollar denominated floating rate borrowings, together with managing the 
exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on these U.S. dollar denominated floating rate borrowings. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -69-
Cross currency interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of the Company's U.S. dollar 
denominated debt to euro and floating rate interest exposures into fixed rate exposures and are set so as 
to match exactly the critical terms of the underlying debt being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest 
rate settings, re-pricing dates). These are all classified as cash-flow hedges of the forecasted U.S. 
dollar variable interest payments on the Company's underlying debt and have been determined to be highly 
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness has been recorded in the 
income statement relating to these hedges in the current year.
 Foreign currency forward contracts are utilised in a number of ways: forecast U.K.  pounds sterling and 
euro revenue receipts are converted into U.S. dollars to hedge against forecasted U.S. dollar payments 
principally for jet fuel, insurance, capital expenditure and other aircraft related costs. These are 
classified as cash-flow hedges of forecasted U.S. dollar payments and have been determined to be highly 
effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from the fluctuation in the U.S. dollar 
to U.K. pounds sterling and euro exchange rates for the forecasted U.S. dollar purchases. Because the 
timing of anticipated payments and the settlement of the related derivatives is very closely coordinated, 
no ineffectiveness has been recorded for these foreign currency forward contracts in the current or 
preceding years (the underlying hedged items and hedging instruments have been consistently closely 
matched).
 The Company also utilises jet fuel forward contracts to manage exposure to jet fuel prices. These are 
used to hedge the Company's forecasted fuel purchases, and are arranged so as to match as closely as 
possible against forecasted fuel delivery and payment requirements. These are classified as cash-flow 
hedges of forecasted fuel payments and have been determined to be highly effective in offsetting 
variability in future cash flows arising from fluctuations in jet fuel prices. No ineffectiveness has been 
recorded on these arrangements in the current or preceding years.
 The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) began operating for airlines on January 1,  2012. In 
order to manage the risks associated with the fluctuation in the price of carbon emission credits, the 
Company entered into swap arrangements to fix the cost of a portion of its forecasted carbon emission 
credit purchases. The Company can forecast its requirement for carbon credits as they are directly linked 
to its consumption of jet fuel. These instruments have been classified as cash-flow hedges and no 
ineffectiveness has been recorded in the current year.

 At June 2013 a spare engine was segregated from the operating fleet and held in anticipation of a sale 
which was agreed in July 2013. A gain on disposal of approximately EUR3.0 million will be recognised in 
the second half of the year.
 There have been no other significant events occurring after the reporting period, up to and including the 
date of approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.
 28     Principal risks and uncertainties
 The principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed as disclosed on pages 23 to 29 in the 
"Principal risks and uncertainties" section of the annual consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 continue to apply.  They include economic risks, relationships and alliances with 
other airlines, staff productivity and industrial relations, our ability to recover increases in commodity 
costs, the impact of ongoing organisation change programmes, potential for operational disruption, and 
fleet management.
 The principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group will be exposed in the second half of the 
financial year are set out below:
 --     Economy: The continuing economic challenges in the Group's primary markets, in particular the 
Group's core Irish market and in key European markets served, has negatively impacted performance and is 
likely to continue to impact the Group's business for the foreseeable future.  Any further deterioration 
in the Irish economy, particularly events which may damage consumer confidence, disposable income, inbound 
tourism or foreign investment may have a significant adverse effect on the business.
 --     Currency: The relative strength of the US dollar against the Euro may adversely affect outbound 
bookings on transatlantic routes and may increase those Group costs, particularly fuel, that are 
denominated in US Dollars.
 --     Closure or disruption of airspace: A closure or disruption of airspace, for example caused by 
extreme weather, volcanic ash or other reasons, could have a significant financial impact on the Group in 
terms of lost revenue and the costs of passenger disruption.
 --     Change management: The Group remains committed to protecting the ongoing benefits to the business 
of successful past restructuring programmes including the Greenfield cost savings programme.  Industrial 
action or the threat of industrial action that may arise in response to the continued focus on cost 
control could have a negative impact on the Group's financial and operating performance.  In this context, 
the Group continues to negotiate with unions representing various sections of its workforce.  If these 
discussions were to prove unsuccessful, any subsequent industrial action could prove damaging to the 
Group's business.
Aer Lingus Group PLC 2013 First Half Results -15-
 --     People: The Group's future performance is dependent on its ability to recruit and retain strong 
and effective staff at all levels, in line with the operational size and shape of the business.  This risk 
is exacerbated by the continuing uncertainty caused by historic offers by Ryanair Holdings plc for the 
Group including Ryanair's most recent offer made in July 2012.
 --     Pension: The trust deeds governing the Irish Airlines (General Employees) Superannuation Scheme 
and the Irish Airlines (Pilots) Superannuation Scheme (collectively the "Irish Pension Schemes") to which 
the Group contributes, state that no changes to those contribution rates are possible without the Group's 
consent. Management remains of the opinion that the liability of the Group to contribute to the Irish 
Pension Schemes is fixed at their respective, current contribution rates and, accordingly that the Group 
has neither a constructive nor a legal obligation to increase its rate of contributions to the Irish 
schemes, even if those schemes were found to have insufficient funds to pay all employees the benefits 
relating to their current and past employment service.
 At 27 March 2013, the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme was estimated to have an actuarial deficit of 
approximately EUR769 million on the statutory minimum funding standard basis. At 27 March 2013, the Irish 
Airlines (Pilots) Superannuation Scheme was estimated to have an actuarial deficit of approximately EUR172 
million on the statutory minimum funding standard basis. In the absence of additional funding commitments 
from Aer Lingus and the other sponsoring employers, the Trustees of the Irish Pension Schemes will be 
required to take measures to improve the scheme's financial position. If such measures result in a 
reduction in member benefits, it is likely that there will be an adverse effect on employee relations. 
There is therefore a risk that the Group could become involved in industrial disputes with its employees, 
which would be significantly detrimental to the operations of the airline and its financial performance.  
It is also possible that the Group's position that it has no responsibility for the deficit in the Irish 
Pension Schemes will be subject to legal challenge from individual employees or deferred pensioners and 
lengthy litigation could ensue. If, contrary to the firm legal advice that the Group has received, a court 
were to find against the Group in any such litigation, significant or very significant loss could arise.
 In the context of the IASS funding shortfall, Aer Lingus Limited has attempted to assist in the 
achievement of a fair outcome that improves the pension prospects of affected IASS members in a way that 
will balance the interests of all parties, including shareholders and employees. On this basis, Aer Lingus 
Limited has participated in a process of discussion under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission 
which commenced in 2010 and, which more recently has also involved the Irish Business and Employers 
Confederation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Labour Court. This process has resulted in the 
development of a proposal (the "IASS Proposal") to address the funding shortfall in the IASS and place the 
provision of pension benefits in Aer Lingus on a sustainable basis.
 The IASS Proposal and the related approval and implementation process represent a highly complex range of 
approvals, consents and agreements involving the Trustee, the Pensions Board, Aer Lingus Limited, Aer 
Lingus Group plc shareholders, DAA, trade unions, active and deferred members, all of which needs to be 
achieved in order for the IASS Proposal to be successfully implemented. Given the nature of the proposed 
adjustments to participants' interests, it is possible that the implementation of the IASS Proposal could 
potentially result in disputes involving Aer Lingus, DAA, SR Technics and Shannon Airport Authority 
Limited and/or the IASS Trustee which could prove damaging to the Group's business.
 See Note 16 for a detailed update on the Group's response to this issue.
 --     Competition: The Group faces strong competition in the markets in which it operates and if the 
Group fails to continue to respond effectively to that competition, market share and financial performance 
could be impacted.
 --     Group ownership: The Group's current share ownership configuration and speculation over future 
ownership continue to require considerable time investment by senior management.  There is a risk that 
continued uncertainty of this nature will inhibit management's ability to develop and implement its 
business strategy, leading to a potential loss in competitiveness.  This uncertainty may also deter 
customers from booking with Aer Lingus if they become concerned about the future of the airline.
 --     Safety: Failure to operate safely or to adequately respond to an emergency safety incident could 
adversely impact the Group's operation and financial performance.
 --     Fuel: Significant fluctuations in the price of fuel could negatively impact the Group's 
operations.
 --     Taxes: New passenger taxes could have a material effect on the performance of Aer Lingus' routes. 
In addition, changes to existing passenger taxes imposed with retrospective effect could have a material 
impact on the Group's financial position. Refer to Note 18 for further details in respect of developments 
in relation to air travel taxes.

financial information in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007, the

 (c)           Maturity and interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities
 At March 31, 2013, the Company had total borrowings of EUR3,498.3 million (2012: EUR3,625.2 million; 
2011: EUR3,649.4 million) from various financial institutions, provided primarily on the basis of 
guarantees granted by the Export-Import Bank of the United States to finance the acquisition of 216 Boeing 
737-800 "next generation" aircraft (2012:199; 2011:185). The guarantees are secured with a first fixed 
mortgage on the delivered aircraft. The remaining long-term debt relates to 30 aircraft held under finance

 RYANAIR Q1 PROFITS FALL 21% (AS GUIDED) TO EUR78M
 TRAFFIC RISES 3% TO 23.2M AS FY GUIDANCE IS UNCHANGED.
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline (ULCC) today (Jul 29) announced that Q1 profits, as previously guided, 
fell 21% to EUR78m as traffic grew 3% to 23.2m. Ave. fares fell 4% due to the timing of Easter and the impact of 
the June French ATC strikes but revenue per pax. rose 1% due to strong ancillary growth.  Unit costs rose 4% 
mainly due to a 6% increase in fuel costs.  Full year guidance, remains unchanged.

Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 "As previously guided higher fuel costs and the timing of Easter led to Q1 profits falling EUR21m to 
EUR78m. Ancillary revenues grew by 25% to EUR357m (27% of total revenues) driven by the successful 
development of reserved seating, priority boarding, and higher admin\credit card fees.
 Unit costs rose 4% in line with the increase in sector length.  Fuel increased 6% to EUR577m or 47% of 
total operating costs.  Excluding fuel, Q1 unit costs rose by 6%, slightly faster than the increase in 
sector length, due to a 2% rise in flight crew pay, and increased Eurocontrol, Spanish airport, and 
Italian ATC charges.  We are 90% hedged for FY14 at $980 p.t and 70% hedged for H1 FY15 at $935 p.t.  We 
have extended our H1 FY15 fuel currency hedge on recent dollar weakness which delivers a 3% cut in our 
fuel cost per pax. for the 70% already hedged in H1 FY15.
 Our seven new bases Eindhoven and Maastricht (Holland), Krakow (Poland), Zadar (Croatia), Chania 
(Greece), Marrakesh and Fez (Morocco) are performing well.  We plan to announce more new routes and new 
bases later this year as we exploit significant growth opportunities in markets where competitors 
including Air Berlin, Alitalia, Iberia, LOT, and SAS are cutting back.  We are in ongoing negotiations 
with MAG, the new owners of Stansted airport to reverse six years of record traffic declines, but there is 
no guarantee that any deal will be agreed.
 UK CC Enquiry.
 Despite no evidence of any material influence, and compelling evidence that competition between Ryanair 
and Aer Lingus has intensified (rather than lessened) over the past 61/2 years, we now expect that the 
UKCC will unlawfully attempt to force us to sell down most, if not all, of our 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus 
on some baseless or invented claim that competition in the future "might" be lessened.  Given the CC's 
total lack of evidence they are now reduced to dreaming up bogus future concerns that Ryanair "might" 
prevent another EU airline acquiring Aer Lingus, despite Ryanair's repeated public statements that we 
would consider any offer by another EU airline to acquire Aer Lingus, and/or acquire Ryanair's 
shareholding.
 We have now eliminated any remaining shred of credibility from this enquiry, by offering to 
unconditionally sell our 29.8% stake to any EU airline which offers for, and successfully acquires, over 
50% of Aer Lingus, despite 61/2 years of evidence that no EU airline other than Ryanair has any interest 
in buying, or investing in, Aer Lingus.  The UK CC has no credibility in this case having taken no action 
whatsoever on behalf of UK Consumers in earlier mergers when BA bought BMI or Easyjet bought GB Airways.  
Yet 61/2 years after one Irish airline (Ryanair) bought 29.8% of Aer Lingus (an Irish airline which 
carries very few UK consumers), the UK CC is now ignoring evidence to pursue an apparently pre-meditated 
decision to force a more draconian sell down on Ryanair than they required in the earlier BSkyB/ITN case.   
This is absurd in the case involving 2 Irish airlines when Aer Lingus affects or carries very few UK 
consumers.  Ryanair will strenuously appeal any such ruling, which is clearly unjustified by the evidence 
in this case, and we will insist that any such order cannot be enforced while we appeal the EU 
Commission's February 2013 Prohibition Decision before the EU Courts.
 Aircraft Order and Shareholder Returns.
 Shareholders have recently approved our order for 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery over a five 
year period between Sept 2014 and Dec 2018.  This has allowed us to raise our growth targets by 38% to 
110m passengers by FY19 (previously 100m) and our fleet to 410 (previously 375).
 The strength of our Balance Sheet with Q1 gross cash of EUR3.6bn and net cash of EUR191m, (despite 
another recent EUR177m share buyback), remains unmatched in our industry.  This strong cash position 
allied to the Capex certainty we now enjoy, following the recent aircraft order, enabled us to announce 
plans to return up to EUR1bn to shareholders over the next two years.  At least EUR400m via share buybacks 
in FY14, and up to a further EUR600m in special dividends or share buybacks in FY15, subject to current 
fuel, yields and profitability trends continuing.  This further EUR1bn brings to over EUR2.5bn the total 
cash returned to Ryanair shareholders in recent years, which is over 4 times the EUR585m originally raised 
from shareholders since our IPO.
 Outlook.
 We expect Q2 yields to rise despite last year's challenging (post-Olympic) comparables, although yields 
on close-in summer bookings have been slightly weaker in recent weeks due, we believe, to the heat wave in 
Northern Europe.  As ever, our outlook remains cautious for the full year as market conditions are tough 
with recession, austerity, high fuel costs, and excessive Government taxes (most recently in Belgium) 
impacting air travel demand and yields.  While we expect full year traffic to grow 3% to 81.5m, we still 
have no visibility over next winter's yields, and on the basis that the recent yield weakness in close-in 
summer bookings does not continue, we see no reason to change our full year profit after tax guidance 
which remains at between EUR570m to EUR600m".

Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, Continental 
Europe, and North Africa the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), operating more than 1,600 daily flights (over 500,000 per 
year) from 57 bases, across 1,600 low fare routes, connecting 180 destinations in 29 countries and operating a fleet 
of 303 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair has recently announced firm orders for a further 175 new Boeing 
aircraft, which will be delivered between 2014 and 2018. Ryanair currently has a team of more than 9,000 highly 
skilled professionals, will carry over 81.5 million passengers this year and has an outstanding 29-year safety record.

 Operating and Financial Overview
 Summary quarter ended June 30, 2013
 Profit after tax decreased by 21% to EUR78.1m compared to EUR98.8m in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 
primarily due to a 4% reduction in average fares and an 8% increase in total operating expenses, offset by 
strong ancillary revenues.  Total operating revenues increased by 5% to EUR1,342.2m, primarily due to 
strong ancillary revenues which grew by 25%, significantly faster than the 3% increase in passenger 
numbers, to EUR356.5m, offset by a 4% reduction in average fare. Total revenue per passenger, as a result, 
increased by 1% whilst Load Factor remained flat at 82% compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2012.
 Total operating expenses increased by 8% to EUR1,238.9m, due to an increase in fuel prices, the higher 
level of activity and operating costs associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, which represents 
47% of total operating costs in both the current and comparative period, increased by 6% to EUR576.6m due 
to the higher price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel 
increased by 6%, however, including fuel unit costs only rose by 4%.  Operating margin decreased by 2 
points to 8% whilst operating profit decreased by 22% to EUR103.3m.
 Net margin was down 2 points to 6%, compared to June 30, 2012.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 5.42 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 6.86 
euro cent at June 30, 2012.
 Balance sheet
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
 Gross cash increased by EUR33.7m since March 31, 2013 to EUR3,592.7m and Gross debt fell by EUR96.8m to 
EUR3,401.5m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR535.2m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR237.3m, a EUR176.6m share buy-back programme and debt repayments.  As a result the Group 
had a stronger net cash position of EUR191.2m at period end (March 31, 2013 EUR60.7m).
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2013
 Profit after tax decreased by 21% to EUR78.1m primarily due to a 4% reduction in average fares, offset by 
strong ancillary revenues, and an 8% increase in total operating expenses.  Total operating revenues 
increased by 5% to EUR1,342.2m primarily due to a 3% rise in passenger numbers and strong ancillary 
revenue offset by the 4% reduction in average fares.  Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs 
in both the current and comparative period, increased by 6% to EUR576.6m due to a higher price per gallon 
paid and increased activity in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 6%, however, including fuel 
unit costs only rose by 4%. Operating margin, as a result of the above, decreased by 2 points to 8% whilst 
operating profit decreased by 22% to EUR103.3m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 5% to EUR1,342.2m primarily due to strong ancillary revenues and a 
3% increase in passenger numbers to 23.2m, offset by a 4% drop in average fares, partially due to the 
timing of Easter, the weakening of sterling to the euro, and the adverse impact of the French ATC strike 
in June 2013.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 1%, primarily due to the strong growth in ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues decreased by 1% to EUR985.7m due to a 4% fall in average fares, partially 
due to the timing of Easter, the weakening of sterling to the euro and the adverse impact of the French 
ATC strike in June 2013, offset by the 3% increase in passenger numbers.  Load factor remained flat at 
82%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 25% to EUR356.5m, faster than the 3% increase in passenger numbers, due 
to a combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network, higher 
admin/ credit card fees and internet related revenues.
 Total operating expenses increased by 8% to EUR1,238.9m due to the 6% rise in fuel costs and increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline, partially offset by the weakening of the sterling to the 
euro.
 Staff costs increased by 13% to EUR130.4m due to a 9% increase in flight hours and a 2% pay increase 
granted in April 2013.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR90.5m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and more 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this year (June 30, 2013: 246) compared to the prior year  
(June 30, 2012: 239).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 6% to EUR576.6m due to higher fuel prices and the increased activity in the 
quarter.
 Maintenance costs increased by 7% to EUR29.8m, due to the higher level of activity and line maintenance 
costs arising from the launch of new bases.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 9% to EUR26.4m, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor 
financing costs and the higher number of leased aircraft in the quarter (June 30, 2013: 57) compared to 
the prior year (June 30, 2012: 55).
 Route charges rose by 13% to EUR155.2m due to the increased number of sectors flown and higher charges.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 6% to EUR176.3m, due to the 3% increase in sectors flown, 
increased charges in Spain, a quadrupling of ATC charges in Italy and the mix of new routes and bases 
launched, partially offset by the weakening of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by 4% to EUR53.7m, 
primarily due to higher marketing spend per passenger due to the launch of new bases and routes and costs 
associated with higher ancillary sales.
 Operating margin decreased by 2 points to 8% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
decreased by 22% to EUR103.3m.
 Finance income increased by 18% to EUR9.1m due to the receipt of dividend income in the quarter, offset 
by lower interest rates on deposits.
 Finance expense decreased by 18% to EUR21.7m primarily due to lower interest rates and lower gross debt 
this quarter compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2012.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR33.7m since March 31, 2013 to EUR3,592.7m and Gross debt fell by EUR96.8m to 
EUR3,401.5m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR535.2m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR237.3m, a EUR176.6m share buy-back programme and debt repayments.  As a result the Group 
had a stronger net cash position of EUR191.2m at period end (March 31, 2013 EUR60.7m).
 Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR154.0m in the period to EUR3,118.6m primarily due to a EUR176.6m 
share buy-back and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives, offset by the net profit after 
tax of EUR78.1m.

Body
 In June 2013 the Company bought back 24.1m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6m.  This is 
equivalent to approximately 1.7% of the Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased 
have been cancelled. Accordingly, share capital decreased by 24.1m ordinary shares with a nominal value of 
EUR0.2m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.2m.  The capital redemption 
reserve is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders over the next 
two years (subject to shareholder approval) with at least EUR400 million in share buybacks to be completed 
in the fiscal year to March 31, 2014 and up to a further EUR600 million in either special dividends or 
share buybacks in the fiscal year to March 31, 2015.

 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.       Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 
was 11.7% (June 30, 2012: 12.2%).  The tax charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 of EUR10.4m (June 
30, 2012: EUR13.7m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.       Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR0.5m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.       Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.       Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2013 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 303 (2012: 294) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  Following 
shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, The Group has agreed to purchase 175 new Boeing 737 800NG 
aircraft during the periods Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2019.
 8.        Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR221.2m at March 31, 2013 to EUR241.2m at 
June 30, 2013 is comprised of a gain of EUR20.0m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from approximately EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 
2013 to approximately EUR1.52 per share at June 30, 2013.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties.  The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/ (loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 --     US Transit: we have now won four contracts this year worth over $15 million in annual revenue, 
extending our footprint to seven states in the US in the core Paratransit, Shuttle and Fixed Route 
markets. Overall, the annual revenue of our Transit business has increased to over $75 million and we have 
an active pipeline worth over $200 million in annual revenue;
 --     German Rail: we have now begun the mobilisation of the two German rail contracts secured earlier 
this year, which will run for 15 years from December 2015, having procured a new fleet of 35 Bombardier 
trains on behalf of our customer, the regional authority. We are continuing to bid regional rail contracts 
in selected regions in Germany with an attractive pipeline of contracts;
 --     UK Rail: having secured the extension to c2c, we are now focusing on the long-term tender for that 
franchise expected later this year. We support the recommendations of the Brown report on the future 
structure of the UK rail industry and believe that UK rail can, in the right circumstances, offer 
profitable future franchises. We are pleased to have been shortlisted by Transport for London (TfL) to bid 
for its Crossrail contract, having demonstrated our capabilities as a high quality commuter and 
metropolitan rail operator;
 --     New contracts and concessions: in addition to new contracts in Guadalajara, Luton Airport and with 
Ryanair, we have been selected as preferred bidder to operate the urban bus service in Tangiers, Morocco, 
a 10 year contract with expected total revenue over that period of EUR125 million that should commence in 
early 2014;
 --     German Coach: operations in Germany started in April, based on the UK Coach model of outsourced 
service provision and using the Alsa website and booking systems. We now serve Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg, 
Cologne and Dusseldorf.
 In addition, we are exploring opportunities in selected markets internationally, where the Group's proven 
expertise as a public transport operator is attractive to authorities considering either liberalisation or 
new public transport services. We are excited by our business development pipeline which provides good 
opportunities into the medium term.

and coach operations has successfully replaced reduced revenue in UK Rail, following the end of the NXEA 
franchise in February 2012.
 Overall revenue in the period increased by 7% in constant currency and excluding rail franchises no 
longer operated, reflecting robust organic growth and the acquisition of the Petermann school bus business 
in North America in May 2012 and is summarised below (all tables have been rounded to the nearest 
million):

Normalised profit
 Normalised operating profit decreased by GBP8.3 million to GBP97.2 million (2012: GBP105.5m). Excluding the 
impact of rail franchises no longer operated, operating profit increased by GBP2 million as we successfully offset 
rising fuel and other inflation through revenue growth and cost efficiency savings, driven by our focus on operational 
excellence, as follows:

Net finance costs increased to GBP25.8 million (2012: GBP24.0m), reflecting a higher level of debt post Petermann 
acquisition and a cash unwind from rail franchises no longer operated. With associate income of GBP0.4 million 
(2012: GBP0.5m), normalised profit before tax was GBP71.8 million (2012: GBP82.0m), as follows:

(2012: 12.6p).
 Non-rail earnings and dividend
 Normalised operating profit from our bus and coach operations in the period increased to GBP92.4 million (2012: 
GBP90.0m), reflecting our successful focus on our non-rail businesses. Unlike rail franchises, we own these in 
perpetuity and believe that our core dividend should be financed only from these earnings. Future rail profits can 
then be returned to shareholders incrementally.

The Group has a policy to pay a dividend at least two times covered by non-rail earnings in the full year. The interim 
dividend for 2013 has been increased by 3% to 3.25 pence per share (2012: 3.15p). Non-rail normalised basic EPS 
in the first half of 2013 were 10.1 pence (2012: 10.0p).
 Statutory profit for the period
 The Group invested GBP11.4 million in exceptional items in the period (2012: GBP16.3m). Acquisition and 
integration costs totalled GBP3.1 million, primarily to complete the Petermann integration and to realise synergies. 
One-off redundancy and rationalisation expenditure was GBP2.5 million, including closure of a depot in UK Coach 
and a call centre in UK Bus.
 Within exceptional items, business development expenditure totalled GBP5.8 million. National Express is investing 
to create new bus and coach opportunities internationally, alongside bids in UK and German rail. The Group's 
policy is to charge development costs for new businesses to exceptional items until such time as a revenue stream 
has been created, from which time the business bears its own development costs as part of normalised profit. 
Consequently, business development costs in North America (school bus and transit), UK Bus and Coach, Spain 
and Morocco are all charged to normalised profit. Exceptional expenditure in the first half of the year was incurred in 
German Rail, German Coach (until the launch of the business in April 2013), international bid opportunities and in 
UK Rail; the latter is charged to exceptional items as the scale of potential bidding costs is material relative to the 
profit generated by the Group's only UK rail franchise, c2c. The Group expects to invest a total of GBP14 million in 
business development charged to exceptional items in 2013 as a whole, which should generate significant future 
earnings potential for National Express and its shareholders.

 RYANAIR OFFERS TO SELL AER LINGUS STAKE
 TO ANOTHER EU AIRLINE
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC) today (23 July) confirmed that, as part of its 
ongoing remedies discussions with the UK Competition Commission (CC) in a case where the CC have produced 
no evidence whatsoever of any lessening of competition as a result of Ryanair's 61/2 year old 29% 
shareholding in Aer Lingus, Ryanair has now offered the following undertaking to the CC:
 In order to dispel the CC's unfounded and invented "concern" that Ryanair's shareholding may prevent Aer 
Lingus from being acquired by another EU airline, Ryanair will undertake to unconditionally sell its 29% 
shareholding to any other EU airline that makes an offer for Aer Lingus and obtains acceptances from 50.1% 
of Aer Lingus shareholders.
 The above remedy is without prejudice to Ryanair's vehement objection to the CC's manifestly false 
conclusion that Ryanair has influence over Aer Lingus' commercial strategy and/or that Ryanair's 61/2 year 
old minority shareholding in Aer Lingus has resulted in a lessening of competition.  This conclusion is 
flatly contradicted by 61/2 years of evidence, by the European Commission's findings in February 2013 that 
competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified, and by the evidence submitted even by Aer 
Lingus and the Irish Government (to the EU), which proves that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus 
intensified to the benefit of consumers over the last 61/2 years.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "It is clear from the CC's own Provisional Findings report that it has found no evidence of any lessening 
of competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  In fact, Ryanair's recent (3(rd) ) offer for Aer Lingus 
was prohibited by the EU precisely because of the evidence, submitted by both Aer Lingus and the Irish 
Government, that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has "intensified" during the past 61/2 years.
 These inconvenient facts have reduced the CC's Simon Polito (Chairman) and Roger Davis (Member) to 
inventing new and fantastical "concerns" in order to justify their apparently premeditated and biased 
"thinking" that Ryanair should be forced to sell down this 61/2 year old minority stake.  The only 
remaining "concern" they can now dream up is that Ryanair's 29% stake "might" prevent another EU airline 
buying Aer Lingus; despite 61/2 years of evidence (and repeated public statements) that no other EU 
airline has any interest in acquiring Aer Lingus.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR OFFERS TO SELL AER LINGUS STAKE
 In order to remove any remaining shred of credibility from this CC process and eliminate any doubt about 
this imaginary albeit non-existent "concern", Ryanair has now agreed that it will unconditionally sell its 
61/2 year old minority stake to any other EU airline which makes an offer for, and acquires more than 
50.1% of, Aer Lingus shares, at the same price and terms which are accepted by these other 50.1% of Aer 
Lingus shareholders.  This remedy unconditionally removes any ability by Ryanair to block any future 
takeover of Aer Lingus by another EU airline.
 This bogus CC "concern" has now been fatally undermined thereby removing any requirement for a divestment 
of Ryanair's 61/2 year old minority shareholding which even the CC now admits hasn't given Ryanair any 
influence, and Aer Lingus admits has led to intensified competition to the benefit of the perhaps 1 or 
maybe 2 UK consumers who even fly Aer Lingus."

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR 3 NEW LONDON RUNWAYS,
 1 EACH AT GATWICK, HEATHROW AND STANSTED
 Ryanair, the UK's only ultra low cost carrier (ULCC) today (18 July) made a submission to the UK 
Government's Airports Commission, calling on Sir Howard Davies and his team to resolve the 30 year old 
runway shortage in the South East of England by recommending that each of the 3 main London airports, 
Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted, be allowed to develop, at the earliest possible date, one new additional 
runway each, which will result in 3 new runways serving London, which will finally address runway capacity 
in the South East for the next 50 years, thereby allowing competition between the 3 airports, to ensure 
that these new runways are delivered in a timely, efficient and cost competitive manner which will 
maximise the gains for UK consumers and visitors.
 Ryanair in its submission has rubbished any new Greenfield airport plan such as 'Boris Island', which it 
criticised as being more of the failed political interference that has bedevilled UK infrastructure 
projects over the past 30 years.  Ryanair believes that any new greenfield airport will take many decades 
to deliver, and will result in vast overspending and inefficiency due to the absence of any existing 
airport or ground transport infrastructure at any such greenfield site.
 The approval of 3 new London runways will prevent the kind of regulatory gaming which has bedevilled 
London runway capacity under the failed BAA airport monopoly, and the "inadequate" CAA regulatory regime 
over the past 30 years.  This failed airport regulatory model allowed the BAA monopoly to constrain 
capacity delivery, in order to charge monopoly prices to airlines and consumers, which has done such 
damage to UK aviation and tourism since the BAA airport monopoly was first privatised in the 1980's.  
Ryanair has called on the Airports Commission to adopt its 3 new London runway proposal, which is the 
timeliest, most efficient long-term solution to the chronic runway shortages currently suffered by all 
airlines and passengers at the 3 main London airports.   This new 3 runway strategy will restore London's 
leadership of European aviation - without any political funding - and enable the South East to respond 
competitively to the new runway developments which have recently been completed in Madrid, Paris and 
Frankfurt.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Three new runways at the three competing London airports is the only sensible and consumer focused 
solution to the chronic runway capacity shortages in London and the South East of England.  We cannot wait 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS FOR 3 NEW LONDON RUNWAYS
30 years and allow billions of pounds to be wasted on 'Boris Island'.   Because each airport and each 
airline (apart from Ryanair) wants to limit competition, they tend to advocate only one runway solutions 
and only at their airport. This means that UK aviation will continue to be hand-cuffed by political 
interference, and "NIMBY" opposition which has stymied aviation policy for the last 30 years.  The UK in 
general and London in particular is being left behind by new runway developments in competitor cities such 
as Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid.
 The failure of recent UK Governments to stand up to misleading environmental groups and their willingness 
to pander to narrow 'NIMBY' interests at individual airports has allowed UK aviation, tourism and job 
creation to be hijacked by backward looking luddites. Sadly the very appointment of the Davies Commission 
is just the latest example of the spineless approach of David Cameron's Government which talks about 
stimulating growth and job creation, but instead of pursuing growth policies they pander to tree huggers 
and NIMBYS.
 Ryanair believes that the solution to the runway shortage in London is both simple and straightforward.  
Thanks to the recent break-up of the BAA airport monopoly, London now has three competing airports, but no 
spare runway capacity.  Instead of pandering to the expensive lobbyists of Ferrovial and Heathrow, the 
Davies Commission should recommend that three new runways be developed and allow the marketplace and 
competition between these three airports to deliver timely, cost efficient and consumer friendly runway 
capacity growth in the manner that will most benefit UK consumers, UK tourism and UK job creation.  These 
3 new runways will in turn deliver an additional 100m passengers p.a., which - given Airport Council 
International figures - will sustain about 100,000 new jobs across the 3 London airports. These 3 new 
runways will also exploit the advantage of the existing road, rail, underground and coach infrastructure 
which already serves these London airports, without the waste, delay and inefficiency of trying to develop 
a new greenfield airports and ground transport to serve them.
 Approving 3 new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted is also the only way to keep Ferrovial/Heathrow 
honest as it promotes its plans to waste further billions on inefficient, gold-plated facilities which 
will allow them to again 'game' the CAA's inadequate regulatory regime to further penalise airlines and 
passengers at Heathrow, with much higher charges.  Competition between the airlines has significantly 
reduced UK air fares over the past 30 years to such an extent that Ryanair now carries more passengers 
than British Airways and Easyjet combined. The Davies Commission (while being another example of David 
Cameron kicking the can down the road) offers a unique opportunity to finally introduce effective 
competition and excess capacity in London's runway infrastructure and Ryanair hopes that Sir Howard and 
his team will seize this historic opportunity."

 National Express Group PLC
 First Half 2013 Pre-Close Trading Update
 National Express Group PLC ("National Express" or "the Group") is a leading international public 
transport operator, with bus, coach and rail services in the UK, Continental Europe, North Africa and 
North America. It today updates on trading for the First Half Year ended 30 June 2013, ahead of its Half 
Year results to be released on 24 July 2013.
 Overview
 Trading in the First Half Year has been in line with our expectations. Total revenue in the First Half 
Year has grown by 7% at constant currency.
 We continue to make strong progress in our three core areas of focus:
 --     Organic growth and operational excellence: across our five divisions, underlying revenue trends 
have improved during the second quarter, supported by a clear focus on cost efficiency and return on 
capital. In UK Bus, commercial and concession revenues are growing. In UK Coach, lower pricing, alongside 
new services, is driving volume growth. In Spain, fare increases and new contracts are supporting the 
business through austerity. North America School Bus is driving an improved return on capital.
 --     Cash generation: we are on course to deliver between GBP125 million and GBP150 million of free 
cash flow in each of 2013 and 2014. We continue to target a gearing of two times EBITDA by the end of 2014 
and drive returns for our shareholders. This is supported by a dividend policy prudently covered by non-
rail earnings.
 --     Business development: we are strengthening our pipeline of new business opportunities. During the 
First Half Year, we have:
 o  increased our North America Transit annual revenue to $75 million,
 o  profitably integrated our recent acquisition in Bilbao,
 o  secured an extension to the c2c UK rail franchise,
 o  pre-qualified for the Crossrail project,
 o  secured and commenced mobilisation of two new German rail contracts,
 o  launched scheduled coach services in Germany,
National Express Group PLC Trading Statement
 o  secured 2 major partnerships in UK Coach, with Luton Airport and Ryanair,
 o  successfully commenced our new Guadalajara contract in Spain, and,
 o  been selected as preferred bidder for a third Moroccan bus contract, in Tangiers.
 Our contract pipeline is developing well, with the potential for meaningful earnings enhancement in the 
medium term.
 Dean Finch, Group Chief Executive, commented:
 "I am pleased with our revenue improvement across the business, reflecting the attractive value and 
quality service we offer our customers. I believe that the combination of organic growth and operational 
excellence, cash generation and new international contract opportunities will drive returns for National 
Express and our shareholders."
 Continental Europe
 Overall revenue in Spain has increased by 3%. Alongside continued strong growth in Morocco, up 30%, the 
launch of the Guadalajara contract and successful integration of the Bilbao acquisition have driven this 
increase.
 Intercity Coach revenue was down 3%, reflecting constrained passenger volume, with fare increases 
offsetting cost pressures. Whilst passenger demand has been affected by wider austerity, there are signs 
that the rate of decline is diminishing. The business also continues to benefit from its flexible 
operational model, with kilometres operated 6% lower. The urban bus market remains resilient, with like-
for-like revenue in Spain declining by 1%, reflecting the re-phasing of some bonus income.
 Alsa has been selected as the preferred bidder to operate the Tangiers urban bus service, our third city 
operation in Morocco. Due to commence in the first half of 2014, the proposed 10 year contract will 
initially deploy 120 buses, with expected total contract revenue of EUR125 million. This contract will 
build on the Group's successful operations in Marrakesh and Agadir.
 In April we launched our Intercity Coach business in Germany. Our initial three routes are performing 
well, with two further services to be launched this month.
 North America
 Total revenue grew 19%, with the anniversary of the Petermann acquisition in May marking the delivery of 
synergies as planned.
 In School Bus, days lost to earlier poor weather have been recovered in the second quarter, along with 
some of the discretionary routes withdrawn at the start of the school year. We continue our focused 
discipline on improving our return on capital, in preference to unconstrained growth. We have targeted 
capital investment carefully and secured price increases on contract retentions that are a significant 
improvement over previous years. We expect to end the current school bus contract bid season close to flat 
in terms of the number of buses operated. 25 new contracts have been secured to date, with 17 lost. Our 
contract retention remains high at 96%.
 In our US Transit business, we have successfully started operating the 4 contracts won since integrating 
our three acquisitions in 2012. With a bid success rate of 30%, we are pleased with progress and the 
opportunities offered in this capital-light market. Our active bid pipeline exceeds $200 million of annual 
revenue.
 UK Bus
 After a weak first quarter for passenger volume, reflecting poor weather and the impact of austerity 
measures, the second quarter has seen a turnaround in patronage for UK Bus. Commercial passenger volumes 
have grown and the reduction in the number of concession passengers all but eliminated. As a consequence, 
network mileage is broadly flat and like-for-like revenue has increased by 3%. Despite higher fuel and 
pension costs in 2013, with the reduction in BSOG now lapped, the outlook for the remainder of the year is 
positive. Operational performance is excellent, with record levels of punctuality reflecting our 
investment in vehicle tracking systems. Fleet investment continues, with 90 new vehicles delivered so far 
this year.
 UK Coach
 Core revenue rose 3% in the First Half Year. Our focus on low fares is proving attractive to consumers 
and driving volume growth. This has been supplemented by the successful start-up of our Luton Airport 
services and additional passengers booking through our Ryanair marketing agreement. Growth in Eurolines 
and a new Airlinks contract have offset weak Rail Replacement revenue, which followed the cessation of our 
East Anglia franchise.
 Rail
 Rail continues to perform well, with the c2c franchise extension secured until at least September 2014. 
c2c continues to deliver industry-leading punctuality and customer satisfaction. These credentials will 
support our bid for the full Essex Thameside tender expected later this year.
 We are pleased to have been shortlisted for the Crossrail tender, further demonstrating our credentials 
as a high quality international rail operator. The bid process is expected to start later this year, with

 RYANAIR DEPUTY CEO TO STEP DOWN IN MARCH 2014
 Ryanair, Europe's only Ultra Low Cost Carrier (ULCC), today (1 July 2013) announced that Michael Cawley, 
its Deputy CEO and Chief Commercial Officer has decided to step down from his full-time Executive role in 
10 months time at the end of March 2014, as he wishes to pursue other business interests including a 
number of Non Executive Board positions.
 Michael, who is responsible for the airline's commercial strategy, its successful "low fares - high load 
factor" operations, as well as overseeing the development of its new route and airport relationships, will 
use the next 10 months to assist a smooth handover to his successor, who will be appointed over the coming 
months.
 The Chairman of Ryanair, David Bonderman has invited Michael Cawley to join the Board as a Non Executive 
Director after he steps down as a full-time Executive in March 2014, and Ryanair is pleased to confirm 
that Michael has accepted this invitation.  It is expected that Michael will join the Board of Ryanair Plc 
in a Non Executive capacity on 1 May 2014 next.
 Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said:
 "I am grateful to Michael for his enormous contribution to the successful growth and development of 
Ryanair over the past 17 years.  I am pleased that he has given us such a long notice period so that he 
can assist his successor over a substantive handover period.  We are also delighted that he has accepted 
David Bonderman's invitation to join the Board as a Non Executive Director from mid 2014 onwards.  We wish 
Michael every success for the future, and are pleased that we will continue to have access to his 
experience as a Non Executive Board member once he steps down from his full-time Executive role in March 
next year.

 RYANAIR'S STATEMENT ON UK COMPETITION COMMISSION TIMETABLE EXTENSION
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (26(th) June) noted that the UK Competition 
Commission has extended the timetable for its investigation into Ryanair's 6 1/2 year old minority 
shareholding in Aer Lingus from 11(th) July to 5(th) September, an extension of 8 weeks.
 Ryanair believes this extension has been caused by the UKCC's realisation that it has no case and has 
produced no evidence of any influence or lessening of competition arising from Ryanair's 6 1/2 year old 
minority stake. Indeed the UKCC is bound by a legal duty of sincere cooperation to respect the European 
Commission's recent (Feb 2013) ruling that competition has intensified between Ryanair and Aer Lingus over 
the past 6 1/2 years.
 As the UKCC's provisional thinking makes clear, its case now depends on three invented and factually 
inaccurate concerns which have been disproven by the past 6 1/2 years of evidence as follows:
 A.   The UKCC believes that Ryanair "might" block an Aer Lingus rights issue, despite the written 
evidence it has received that Ryanair has repeatedly assured Aer Lingus that it will support any rights 
issue in order to prevent dilution.
 B.    The UKCC believes that Ryanair "might" block the sale of Heathrow slots, despite the fact that 
Ryanair recently (April 2013) supported the proposed sale by Aer Lingus of a pair of Heathrow slots to BA.  
However, this CC concern is obviously spurious given that the sale of Heathrow slots would reduce 
competition on the Dublin-London route and therefore the theoretical blocking of any such slot sale would 
promote, rather than lessen competition.
 C.   The UK CC believes that Ryanair "might" prevent Aer Lingus taking over another airline or another EU 
airline taking over Aer Lingus.  Again this concern is refuted by the evidence of Ryanair's repeated 
statements (Sept 2011 and May 2012) that Ryanair would consider any proposal by another airline to acquire 
Aer Lingus and/or to acquire Ryanair's shareholding, despite the fact that Ryanair has received no such 
approaches from any other EU airline.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said;
 "It's clear that the UKCC's case is falling apart.  It has been forced to accept the EU's finding that 
competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified over the last 6 1/2 years to the benefit of 
consumers, yet it has failed to explain why it's investigating a 6 1/2 year old failed offer for Aer 
Ryanair Holdings PLC STATEMENT ON UK COMPETITION COMMISSION
Lingus in circumstances where Aer Lingus accounts for less than 1% of UK air traffic and affects very few, 
if any, UK consumers.
 The fact that the UKCC is now desperately inventing bogus concerns which past and current evidence shows 
just how threadbare and weak the UKCC's case is.  This was clearly a politically motivated reference by 
the UK's OFT, at the same time as they were ignoring BA's acquisition of British Midland, and Iberia's 
acquisition of Vueling. Given that neither the Irish nor the European Competition Authorities had any 
difficulty with Ryanair's 61/2 year old minority stake, the UKCC should explain why they are wasting UK 
taxpayers' time or resources investigating a 6 1/2 year old failed merger between two Irish airlines which 
the European Commission has recently blocked on the basis that competition has "intensified" between the 
airlines.
 Ryanair believes that this extension is a ruse by the UKCC to try to invent new concerns or strengthen 
its threadbare case against Ryanair's 6 1/2 year old minority stake under which Ryanair clearly has had no 
material influence over Aer Lingus and which has not led to a "lessening" but rather an "intensification" 
of competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair believes that the UKCC's provisional findings contained more jokes than a Monty Python script. 
Yesterday's announcement of this extension, merely confirms this fact, which is why the UKCC needs more 
time to try to invent bogus concerns or strengthen its threadbare case so that it doesn't have to suffer 
the indignity of reversing its provisional thinking or ultimately losing on appeal before the UK and 
European courts."

 UK Competition Commission Timetable Extension
 Dublin & London, 26 June 2013:  Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") has been informed by the UK 
Competition Commission ("UK CC") that it has extended the timetable for its investigation into Ryanair's 
minority shareholding in Aer Lingus by eight weeks. The statutory deadline for the completion of the 
investigation is now 5 September 2013.
 In taking the decision the UK CC had regard to the scope and complexity of the inquiry, the need to allow 
sufficient time to take full account of any comments received in response to its provisional findings and 
the need to consider the effectiveness and practicability of the range of possible remedies.  This is the 
maximum extension permissible under the UK Enterprise Act 2002 in such circumstances.
 Aer Lingus will continue to assist the UK CC in the investigation into the anti-competitive effects of 
Ryanair's minority shareholding. Notwithstanding the statutory deadline date of 5 September 2013, the UK 
CC has said that it expects to issue its final report in August 2013.

 RYANAIR RAISES ITS GROWTH PLANS FROM 100M TO 110M PAX BY MAR 2019
 PLANS TO RETURN EUR1BN TO SHAREHOLDERS OVER NEXT 2 YEARS
 At an investor conference in London today (June 20th) Ryanair, Europe's only ultra low cost carrier 
(ULCC) will brief analysts and major shareholders on its revised plans in two important matters as 
follows:
 1. In response to increased demand (and lower costs) from both existing and new airport partners across 
Europe, Ryanair intends to step up its growth rate from 5% to 7% p.a. over the coming years and will 
therefore target to carry 110m passengers by FY March 2019 instead of the previous 100m target.
 2. Ryanair detailed plans to return up to EUR1bn to shareholders over the next two years with at least 
EUR400m in share buybacks to be completed during the current year to FY Mar 2014 and up to a further 
EUR600m in either special dividends or share buybacks targeted in FY March 2015 subject to current fuel, 
yields and profitability trends continuing.
 A further investor day is scheduled for New York next Tuesday (25th June) where North American analysts 
and investors will be briefed on these increased growth and shareholder return plans.
 Ends.

 RYANAIR & BOEING FINALISE FIRM ORDER FOR 175 NEW 737-800 AIRCRAFT
 OVER 100M RYANAIR PAX P.A. & 3,000 NEW JOBS
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC), today (19 June) finalised a firm order with Boeing for 175 new 
737-800 aircraft in a deal worth $15.6 billion at current list prices, which will allow Ryanair to grow its fleet to more 
than 400 aircraft, serving more than 100m passengers p.a. across Europe by the end of the delivery stream in FY 
2019.
 The deal, which was originally announced as a commitment in March, is Boeing's largest ever firm aircraft order 
from a European airline and the largest industrial order in the history of the Irish State and was concluded by 
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive, Ray Conner, at 
a ceremony today at the Paris Air Show.
 These 175 new Boeing aircraft will create more than 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers at 
Ryanair's growing number of aircraft bases across Europe and will allow Ryanair to grow by about 5% p.a. over the 
next five years, taking Ryanair's traffic to over 100m p.a. passengers by March 2019.
 Ryanair's order will also sustain thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in Boeing and its supplier companies and 
represents the largest ever capital investment by an Irish company in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. jobs. The first of 
these new Boeing aircraft is due for delivery in September 2014 and a senior Ryanair working group is continuing to 
evaluate the benefits of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, which enters service in 2017.
 Announcing the order, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to finalise this firm order with Boeing to purchase 175 new 737-800 jets, which will expand our 
fleet to over 400 units, creating over 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, while allowing us to grow 
our traffic over the next 5 years to 100 million passengers p.a.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR & BOEING FINALISE ORDER
 Ryanair is proud to buy Boeing, who make great aircraft and the 737-800 has been the foundation of Ryanair's 
recent successful growth due to its great engineering and phenomenal reliability. These 175 new airplanes will 
enable us to lower costs and airfares even further, thereby widening Ryanair's price leadership over all other 
airlines in Europe. They provide Ryanair with the additional capacity to exploit substantial growth opportunities that 
now exist as many of Europe's flag and regional airlines are restructuring and are reducing their short-haul 
operations.
 Ryanair operates the largest fleet of Boeing airplanes in Europe, and this firm order for 175 aircraft will enable 
Ryanair to grow by offering more competition, lower prices, and better choice to passengers right across Europe. 
Ryanair is proud to be investing in high-quality US manufacturing and jobs."
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, Ray Conner, said:
 "We are delighted to finalise this order, it is testament to the value that the Next-Generation 737 family brings to 
Ryanair. As the most efficient, reliable, large single-aisle airplane flying today, the Next-Generation 737 has been 
and will continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet. I could not be more proud to see the partnership 
between Ryanair and The Boeing Company extended for the years to come."

 SPINELESS AER LINGUS BOARD ROLL OVER
 AGAIN AND AGAIN AT COST OF EUR600M AND RISING
 Ryanair, Europe's only Ultra Low Cost Carrier (ULCC) and a 61/2 year old minority shareholder in Aer Lingus today 
(31 May) condemned the spineless Board and Management of Aer Lingus which has accepted the latest crazy Irish 
Labour Court recommendation that another EUR170m to EUR200m of shareholder funds be squandered to 
compensate Aer Lingus staff for a pension deficit which Aer Lingus has repeatedly assured shareholders is a 
defined contribution ('DC') pension scheme, and for which Aer Lingus has no further liability.  If, as Aer Lingus' IPO 
prospectus (and every subsequent annual report) confirmed, neither Aer Lingus nor its shareholders have any 
liability towards this 'DC' pension scheme, then why is yet another EUR170m to EUR200m being wasted on yet 
another pay off for Aer Lingus' staff.
 Ryanair pointed out that this is not the 1(st) , not the 2(nd) , but the 6(th) time (in 7 years) that Aer Lingus' staff 
have blackmailed the Government and trade union controlled Board of Aer Lingus, to enrich themselves at 
shareholders expense at a total cost of over EUR600m and rising as follows:
 Aer Lingus post IPO exceptional payments to staff & unions
Year       Payment          Reason
 -------  ------------------  ------------------------------------------
 2006        EUR132m         Pension deficit & ESOT contributions
 -------  ------------------  ------------------------------------------
 2008        EUR138m         Staff restructuring and PCI payments
 -------  ------------------  ------------------------------------------
 2009          EUR89m        Staff restructuring and PCI payments
 -------  ------------------  ------------------------------------------
 2010          EUR55m        ESOT debt & leave/redundancy tax payments
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR - SPINELESS AER LINGUS BOARD
 -------  ------------------  ------------------------------------------
 2012          EUR17m        Staff restructuring payments
 -------  ------------------  ------------------------------------------
 2013    EUR170m - EUR200m   Pension deficit & employee payments
 -------  ------------------  ------------------------------------------
 Total    EUR600m - EUR630m
 -------  ------------------  ------------------------------------------
This latest staff grab of EUR170m - EUR200m confirms Ryanair's belief that Aer Lingus cannot be trusted to 
protect shareholder funds from repeated raids by its unions and staff.  Over the past 7 years since Aer 
Lingus' flotation, more than EUR600m in "exceptional payments" has been unjustifiably snatched by staff, 
while the Board and Management repeatedly promise shareholders that each time would be the "last time".  
As recently as September 2011, Aer Lingus CEO Christoph Mueller and CFO Andrew Macfarlane assured 
shareholders at investor meetings that they would not make "any further contributions to the pension 
scheme above the current DC rate of 6.375%".  Just 18 months later they both roll over and shell out 
another EUR170m to EUR200m and agree an increased D.C. rate of 10%, thereby increasing Aer Lingus' cost 
base, with no benefit for Aer Lingus shareholders.
 The recent record of this Government appointed Board of Aer Lingus in safeguarding its shareholder funds 
from staff grabs is awful, as the following examples demonstrate:
 1.   Following its 2006 IPO, Aer Lingus made a one off (not to be repeated) contribution of EUR104m to 
eliminate its pension scheme deficit on the basis that the scheme would thereafter be a defined 
contribution (D.C.) scheme and Aer Lingus would have no future obligations for any deficits.
 2.   In Dec 2010, when the ESOT (Employee Share Ownership Trust) was unable to service its bank debts, 
Aer Lingus wrote a cheque (on Christmas Eve) for EUR26m - without shareholder approval - to pay off the 
ESOT's debts, again with no benefit for shareholders.
 3.   Also in 2010 when the Irish Revenue rejected Aer Lingus' "leave and rehire redundancy scheme", which 
gave rise to employee tax liabilities of almost EUR30m, the Board and Management again rolled over and 
paid  more than EUR29m in "exceptional payments" - without shareholders approval - to pay off these 
personal tax liabilities of Aer Lingus staff.
 4.   Now in 2013, when the Aer Lingus DC pension scheme has again racked up multi million euro deficits, 
the unions threaten industrial action, and the spineless Board of Aer Lingus again roll over and splash 
out between EUR170m to EUR200m in pension contributions, pay increases, annual increments and other 
benefits to Aer Lingus' staff.  This brings to over EUR600m the exceptional payments made to Aer Lingus 
staff since the company floated in Sept 2006.
 Ryanair believes that these EUR600m staff pay-offs over 7 years shows that the Board of Aer Lingus (which 
is controlled by the Irish Government and trade union bosses) cannot be trusted with shareholder funds.  
They roll over every time they are threatened.  Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus will, with the connivance 
of the Irish Government, continue to squander shareholder funds every time they are threatened by the 
vested interests of staff.
 Ryanair will vote against this unwarranted and unjustified pay-off of up to EUR200m to a 'DC' pension 
scheme which Aer Lingus has confirmed it has no liability for.  However since Ryanair's minority stake 
gives it no influence or control over Aer Lingus it will yet again be voted down by the Government and 
unions who control and run Aer Lingus.  Ryanair believes that this EUR600m to EUR630m of exceptional 
payments to Aer Lingus staff over the last 7 years since its IPO is a scandal which must be exposed and 
ended.  Ryanair calls on the Board of Aer Lingus to stand up for shareholders and resist this industrial 
relations blackmail by unions and staff.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "How many times are the Board of Aer Lingus going to roll over when their staff and unions threaten 
industrial action unless they get paid off again and again.  The original pension pay-off of EUR104m in 
2006 was sold to shareholders at the IPO on the basis that Aer Lingus would have no obligation to any 
future pension deficits. Now despite paying over EUR400m to its staff in exceptional payouts over the last 
6 years, yet another EUR170m to EUR200m of shareholder funds is to be squandered on paying off a deficit 
in a D.C. pension scheme and providing for annual increments which don't exist in any other privately run 
company!  We believe this is blatant mismanagement by a Board which is controlled by, and panders to, 
Government and unions and does nothing to protect shareholder funds.
 This decision is irreconcilable with the repeated assurances given by Christoph Mueller CEO and Andrew 
Macfarlane CFO at previous investor meetings that Aer Lingus would not make any further one-off 
contributions to this D.C. pension scheme.  Today's decision (which could only take place in a company 
that was controlled by the Government and trade unions) is yet another example of how shareholder funds 
are being squandered to buy off staff again and again.  Ryanair will oppose this latest "daylight robbery" 
of up to EUR200m, which brings to over EUR600m the cash that the staff of Aer Lingus have grabbed in 
exceptional payments since 2006.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR - SPINELESS AER LINGUS BOARD
 Ryanair does not believe that this latest exceptional payout will be the last.  The Aer Lingus unions 
have repeatedly shown that whenever they threaten, the Board and Management will roll over.  This will 
continue while Aer Lingus remains controlled by a Board of Directors which was appointed by and is 
controlled by the Irish Government and ICTU boss David Beggs and which has presided over wholesale 
destruction of Aer Lingus' share price, a six year record of cumulative losses, 3 years of declining 
traffic and now over EUR600m in exceptional pay-offs to Aer Lingus' 3,000 staff or over EUR200,000 a head.  
As a public company, Aer Lingus should be run for the benefit of its shareholders and not to repeatedly 
enrich its 3,000 staff."

 Ryanair may have to reduce its stake in Aer Lingus
 Ryanair Holdings plc (Ryanair) faces having to reduce its shareholding in Aer Lingus Group plc (Aer 
Lingus), after the Competition Commission (CC) provisionally decided that its 29.8 per cent stake could 
reduce competition on routes between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.
 In a summary of its provisional findings, published today, the CC has concluded that the shareholding 
gives Ryanair the ability to influence the commercial policy and strategy of Aer Lingus, its main 
competitor on these routes.
 The CC has provisionally found that, against a background of consolidation in the airline industry, 
Ryanair's shareholding obstructs Aer Lingus's ability to merge or combine with another airline to build 
scale and achieve synergies to remain competitive.
 The CC has also found that Ryanair's shareholding allows it to block special resolutions by Aer Lingus 
and to hinder its plans to issue shares and raise capital; it could also prevent its rival from disposing 
of its valuable slots at Heathrow airport.
 The CC has today published a notice of possible remedies which seeks views on how much of its 
shareholding Ryanair should have to sell and whether such a disposal should be accompanied by other 
safeguards, should the CC's provisional findings be confirmed.
 Simon Polito, CC Deputy Chairman and Chairman of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry group said:
 'Our provisional view is that Ryanair's shareholding is likely to weaken its main competitor on routes 
between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.
 Whilst not giving it control over the day-to-day running of its rival, Ryanair's minority shareholding 
can influence the major strategic decisions that could be crucial to Aer Lingus's future as a competitive 
airline on these and other routes.
 We were particularly concerned about Ryanair's influence over Aer Lingus's ability to be acquired by, 
merge with, or acquire another airline. We thought it likely that such a combination would be necessary to 
increase Aer Lingus's scale and achieve synergies to allow it to remain competitive in future.
Competition Commission Ryanair may have to reduce its stake in Aer Lingus
 We recognize that there has been competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair since 2006. However, without 
Ryanair's minority shareholding, competition might have been more intense and may be restricted in the 
future. Passengers on routes between Great Britain and Ireland will benefit from Aer Lingus continuing to 
compete vigorously with Ryanair and so Aer Lingus needs to be free to take any actions that will 
strengthen its position in the future.'
 The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) referred the case to the CC in June 2012, shortly after which Ryanair 
made its third bid for Aer Lingus, following previous unsuccessful attempts launched in 2006 and 2008. The 
most recent bid was investigated by the European Commission and prohibited in February 2013.
 The CC's own inquiry was extended whilst Ryanair sought to challenge the CC's jurisdiction in view of the 
European Commission investigation. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (in August 2012) and the Court of 
Appeal (in December 2012) both dismissed Ryanair's challenges and the Supreme Court refused it permission 
to appeal further in April. The CC restarted its investigation in March 2013.
 The CC will publish its full provisional findings in the next few days. The provisional findings summary, 
notice of possible remedies and all other information relating to the inquiry can be found here.
 The CC is expected to publish its final report by 11 July 2013.
 The CC would like to hear from all interested parties, in writing, on the provisional findings report by 
no later than 20 June 2013 and on the notice of possible remedies by no later than 11 June 2013. To submit 
evidence, please email Ryanair.Aerlingus@cc.gsi.gov.uk or write to:

 Notes for editors
 1.    The CC is an independent public body, which carries out investigations into mergers, markets and 
the regulated industries.
 2.    The Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry group is: Simon Polito(CC Deputy Chairman and Chairman of the 
Group), Roger Davis, Carolan Dobsonand Professor Michael Waterson.
 3.    The OFT commenced an investigation into Ryanair's stake of 29.8 per cent in Aer Lingus in October 
2010 but the OFT's investigation was suspended on two occasions, once by the OFT because it had 
insufficient information with which to proceed, and once due to a legal challenge by Ryanair, which was 
dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 22 May 2012.
 4.    Ryanair initially acquired a stake in Aer Lingus in late 2006. It mounted a public bid for the 
entire shareholding in Aer Lingus in October 2006. The European Commission investigated the public bid and 
decided to prohibit it in June 2007. In July 2010, the General Court upheld the decision and ruled that 
the European Commission does not have the ability to examine or require divestment of minority 
shareholdings that do not confer 'decisive influence' for the purposes of the EU Merger Regulation. 
Ryanair's latest bid for the remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus was prohibited by the European 
Commission on 27 February 2013. Ryanair lodged an appeal with the General Court against this decision on 8 
May 2013.
 5.    The Enterprise Act 2002 empowers the OFT to refer to the CC completed or proposed mergers for 
investigation and report which create or enhance a 25 per cent share of supply in the UK (or a substantial 
part thereof) or where the UK turnover associated with the enterprise being acquired is over GBP70 
million.
 6.    Further information on this inquiry, including the terms of reference and other key documents, as 
well as on the CC and its procedures, including its policy on the pro-vision of information and the 
disclosure of evidence, can be obtained from the CC website at: www.competition-commission.org.uk.

 UK COMPETITION COMMISSION PROVISIONAL DECISION ON RYANAIR/AER LINGUS 61/2 YEAR OLD MINORITY STAKE IS IN 
BREACH OF EU LAW
 -
 THE CC CANNOT IGNORE 61/2 YEARS OF EVIDENCE
 WHICH DISPROVES THEIR PROVISIONAL FINDINGS
 Ryanair, European's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (30 May) criticised the UK Competition 
Commission's (CC's) provisional decision that Ryanair, through its 61/2 year old minority (29.8%) 
shareholding in Aer Lingus, 'has influence' over Aer Lingus and that this 'could reduce competition'.  
This unfounded claim is disproven by the European Commission's recent (Feb 2013) ruling that competition 
between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has "intensified" since 2007.
 Under EU law, the UK CC has a duty of "sincere cooperation" with the EU, and cannot contradict or reach 
different conclusions to the European Commission's findings.  Inexplicably, today's provisional decision 
by the CC infringes this duty of sincere co-operation by ignoring the recent findings of the European 
Commission that:
 "Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete on a greater number of routes compared to the 2007 Decision" and "there 
is significant competitive interaction between the Parties" and "evidence collected by the Commission in 
the market investigation has also confirmed that the competitive relationship between Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus has at least persisted, if not increased, since 2007".
 Should the CC maintain this untenable position in its final decision (due in July), Ryanair will appeal 
that decision to the UK Competition Appeals Tribunal and thereafter, if necessary, to the Court of Appeal.  
Until the outcome of this UK appeal, and the completion of Ryanair's appeal against the European 
Commission's February 2013 prohibition decision, the CC cannot impose any remedies, however unlawful, on 
Ryanair.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "This provisional decision by the UK CC is bizarre and manifestly wrong. The CC's finding that Ryanair's 
shareholding obstructs Aer Lingus' ability to attract other airlines was disproved by Etihad's purchase of 
a 3% stake and the evidence submitted by other large EU airlines, which confirmed that Ryanair's 
shareholding was not a barrier to other airlines acquiring a stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR - UK COMPETITION COMMISSION
 In February 2013 the European Commission found that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has 
"intensified" since 2007.  A decision by the Competition Commission that Ryanair's 29.8% stake in Aer 
Lingus may lead to a lessening of competition will clearly breach the EU Treaty duty of sincere 
cooperation between the EU and the UK.  Ryanair therefore calls on the Competition Commission to abide by 
this overriding legal principle and end this bogus and baseless enquiry into a 61/2 year old minority 
shareholding between two Irish airlines.
 While Ryanair is one of the UK's largest airlines, Aer Lingus has a tiny presence in the UK, serving just 
6 routes to the Republic of Ireland, a traffic base that has declined over the past 3 years and now 
accounts for less than 1% of all UK air traffic.  This case, involving two Irish airlines where one (Aer 
Lingus) accounts for less than 1% of the UK's total air traffic, is yet another enormous waste of UK 
taxpayer resources on a case which has little if any impact on UK consumers.
 UK taxpayer interests would be better served if the UK Competition Commission investigated (rather than 
ignored) BA's recent takeovers of BMI, Iberia and Vueling, instead of wasting time pursuing this Irish 
case, which is of no consequence to UK consumers."

 RYANAIR FULL YEAR PROFITS UP 13% TO EUR569M
 TRAFFIC UP 5% TO 79M, NEW AIRCRAFT ORDER UNDERPINS GROWTH
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC) today (May 20) announced (record) annual profits of 
EUR569m, up 13% on last year despite higher oil costs. Revenues rose 13% to EUR4.88bn as traffic grew 5% to 
79.3m passengers. Unit costs rose 8% mainly due to an 18% (EUR292m) increase in fuel. Excluding fuel unit costs 
rose by 3%, while avg. fares improved by 6%.

Announcing these profits Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
 The highlights of the past financial year include:-
 --    Profits grew by 13% to EUR569m.
 --    Traffic grew 5% to 79.3m (despite grounding up to 80 winter aircraft).
 --    7 new bases - Chania (Greece), Eindhoven (Netherlands), Fez (Morocco), Krakow (Poland), Maastricht 
(Netherlands), Marrakech (Morocco) & Zadar (Croatia).
 --    217 new routes (y/e total over 1,600 routes).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 --    15 new aircraft delivered (y/e fleet 305).
 --    2nd special div. of EUR492m and EUR68m share buyback completed.
 --    175 new aircraft order, delivery 2014 to 2018 (sub. to June 18 EGM approval).
 Delivering a 13% increase in profits and 5% traffic growth despite high oil prices during a European 
recession is testimony to the strength of Ryanair's ultra-low cost model.  Fuel costs rose by over 
EUR290m, and now represent 45% of total costs.  Excluding fuel, unit costs were up 3% due to excessive and 
unjustified increases in Italian ATC, Eurocontrol and Spanish airport fees.  Ancillary revenues outpaced 
traffic growth, rising 20% to EUR1,064m or 22% of total revenue.
 Growth - New Routes and Bases
 This summer Ryanair opened 7 new bases, and more than 200 new routes as we continue our strategy of 
growing Europe's largest passenger airline.  However with 9 (net) additional aircraft and longer sectors, 
traffic growth this summer will be very modest at approx. 2%.  By grounding fewer aircraft next winter we 
expect to deliver slightly faster H2 monthly growth which should result in overall traffic growth for the 
full year rising by more than 2m to 81.5m passengers.
 Forward bookings on our new routes and bases this summer are ahead of expectations (albeit at modest 
yields) as competitor airlines continue to restructure and cut short-haul capacity.  We expect growth 
opportunities for Ryanair to expand and improve for the foreseeable future.
 Our new route teams continue to handle more growth opportunities than our current fleet expansion allows. 
Significant opportunities are opening up in Germany, Scandinavia and central Europe in particular, where 
Air Berlin, SAS and LOT continue to restructure.  We are in active discussions with the new owners of 
Stansted Airport and the new management at Dublin Airport and while no agreements have yet been reached, 
if a competitive cost base emerges, then we could restart growth at one or other airports as early as 
September 2013.
 We have also made offers to the Spanish airport monopoly AENA to reverse a significant proportion of its 
traffic declines over the past two years.  In a country where youth unemployment runs at 50%, their policy 
of increasing airport fees, while traffic declined from 220m to 180m over the past six years is plainly 
ill-judged.  As ever, Ryanair remains willing to exploit growth opportunities wherever airports provide 
attractive incentives to do so.
 Market Share Gains
 Ryanair continues to expand, making meaningful share gains in many of Europe's largest markets.  In 
addition to being the No. 1 passenger airline in Ireland, and Spain, we have in the last 12 months 
overtaken Alitalia and LOT to become Italy's and Poland's No. 1 airline, respectively.  Ryanair believes 
that its unique low cost advantage will enable the airline to achieve a 20% share of the European short-
haul market over the next 5 years, particularly given that many of Europe's high fare incumbents are 
restructuring and cutting capacity.
 New 175 Aircraft Order
 Ryanair's successful growth, allied to deep short-haul restructuring among many high fare competitors, 
gives us confidence that we can grow from 80m p.a. to over 100m passengers p.a. over the next 5 years.  
Our recent order for 175 firm B 737-800 aircraft represents an enormous opportunity for shareholders as 
Ryanair returns to higher rates (5% p.a.) of traffic growth.  We are pleased to have reached acceptable  
pricing with Boeing, and the controlled delivery programme from Autumn 2014 to end of 2018 will provide 
the opportunity to expand Ryanair's fleet to over 400 aircraft and our traffic to over 100m p.a.  Ryanair 
is now uniquely positioned to offer many of Europe's airports sustained traffic growth in return for low 
cost, efficient facilities.  I am confident that in time this new order will enable Ryanair to extend its 
traffic leadership over Europe's airlines, and generate further returns for our shareholders.
 Aer Lingus
 We were disappointed that the European Commission in February 2013 decided to prohibit Ryanair's third 
offer for Aer Lingus.  It is bizarre that the EU can wave through BA's offer for British Midland in Phase 
1 with few remedies, yet months later reject Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus which was accompanied by a 
revolutionary remedies package delivering two upfront buyers to open competing bases in Dublin and Cork 
airports.  We have no doubt that this was yet another politically motivated decision by Europe's 
competition authority and it is inexplicable in the context of its stated policy of promoting European 
airline consolidation.
 Having our third offer for Aer Lingus prohibited by the EU Commission on the grounds that "competition 
between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified since 2007", our shareholding is now the subject of an even 
more bizarre regulatory inquiry in the UK where the Competition Commission are reviewing our 61/2 year old 
minority stake in Aer Lingus on the basis that it may have "lessened competition" between Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus.  Given that the UK Competition Commission has a legal duty of sincere co-operation with the EU, we 
believe they cannot make a contrary finding, and so this spurious and time wasting inquiry into a 61/2 
year old minority stake between two Irish airlines, one of whom (Aer Lingus) has a tiny presence in the UK 
market should now be abandoned in the light of the EU Commission's finding that competition between 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 Fuel Hedging
 In recent years high oil prices and competitor fuel surcharges have made Ryanair's fares even more 
attractive to hard pressed European consumers.  The combination of high oil prices, increasing competitor 
losses, together with a shortage of financing for weaker credits, will lead to continued EU consolidation 
and closures.  Ryanair is 90% hedged for FY'14 at $980 per tonne (approx. $98 p.bl) and we have now 
extended our hedges into FY'15 with 25% of H1 hedged at $930 per tonne (approx. $93 p.bl).  We hope to 
continue to make meaningful reductions in our oil costs into FY'15.
 Balance Sheet
 Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry.  Our aircraft which have been 
purchased at substantially discounted prices, represents a significant long term benefit for our 
shareholders.  We have gross cash over EUR3.5bn and year-end net cash of EUR61m, despite having returned 
almost EUR500m to shareholders in November (EUR1.5bn over the past 5 years) via a second special dividend.  
We have also taken advantage of current low interest rates to secure almost 70% of our fleet financing all 
in at under 3% and we have completed our Capex hedging programme to the end of 2014 at Euro/Dollar 
exchange rate of 1.32.
 Outlook
 We expect traffic in FY.14 to grow by 3% to 81.5m.  Growth will be slower in H1 at approx. 2%, but rise 
to approx. 5% in H2 as we ground fewer winter aircraft (up to 60) compared to prior years.  Unit costs 
will increase primarily due to rising oil prices, a 3% growth in sector length, and unjustified higher 
Eurocontrol and Spanish airport charges.  Due to lower yields and higher fuel costs Q1 Net Profit will be 
lower than last year due to the timing of Easter (which boosted Q4 revenues) and its presence in the prior 
year Q1 comparable. With almost zero yield visibility into H2 and the EU wide recession, we expect that 
there will continue to be downward pressure on yields which will dampen full year profit growth.  We 
expect modest yield and traffic growth for the full year to be partly offset by higher oil and Eurocontrol 
costs resulting in another year of profit growth in FY'14 which - subject to winter yield outturns - 
should increase to a range of between EUR570m to EUR600m".

Body
 Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and 
Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, operating more than 1,500 flights per day (over 500,000 per year) 
from 57 bases and over 1,600 low fare routes across 29 countries, connecting 180 destinations and operating a 
fleet of 303 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Regulated by the Irish Aviation Authority, Ryanair currently has a team of 
more than 8,500 people, will carry approx. 81.5 million passengers in the current fiscal year (ending 31 Mar 2014) 
and has an unblemished 29-year safety record.

 Aircraft rental costs increased by 8% to EUR98.2m, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor 
financing costs and adverse euro/dollar exchange rates on new leased aircraft.
 Route charges rose by 6% to EUR486.6m due to the increased number of sectors flown and higher charges, 
offset by a slightly shorter sector length.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 10% to EUR611.6m, due to the 5% increase in sectors flown, 
increased charges in Spain, a quadrupling of ATC charges in Italy, the mix of new routes and bases 
launched, and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs, which include ancillary costs, increased by EUR17.9m to EUR197.9m, 
primarily due to higher marketing spend per passenger due to the launch of new bases and routes and costs 
associated with higher ancillary sales.
 Operating margin increased by 1 point to 15% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 16% to EUR718.2m.
 Finance income decreased by 38% to EUR27.4m due to the decline in deposit interest rates, particularly 
for funds placed with highly rated financial institutions.
 Finance expense decreased by 9% to EUR99.3m primarily due to lower interest rates this year compared to 
the year ended March 31, 2012.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR43.4m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,559.0m and Gross debt fell by EUR126.9m to 
EUR3,498.3m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR1,023.5m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR310.7m, a dividend of EUR491.5m, debt repayments and a EUR67.5m share buy-back 
programme.  As a result, the Group has moved to a net cash position of EUR60.7m. (March 31, 2012 net debt 
EUR109.6m).
 Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR34.1m in the period to EUR3,272.6m due to the payment of a EUR491.5m 
dividend, a EUR67.5m share buy-back and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives and 
employee share options, offset by the net profit after tax of EUR569.3m.
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Preliminary Financial Statements
 1.   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland.  The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2013 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2012 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2012, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2012, are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2012 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group 
Accounts) Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 
31, 2012, together with the independent auditor's report thereon,  have been filed with the Irish 
Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the 
Company's Website.  The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the preliminary 
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2013 on May 17, 2013.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards adopted for the first 
time in the year ended March 31, 2013, which would have a material impact on our financial position or 
results from operations.
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of 
these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations.

 2.   Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.   Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
 4.   Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2013 
was 12.5% (March 31, 2012: 11.5%).  The tax charge for the year ended March 31, 2013 of EUR81.6m (March 
31, 2012: EUR72.6m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement and the utilisation of previous trading losses.
 5.   Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.9m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.   Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.  Capital commitments
 At March 31, 2013 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 305 (2012: 294) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  On March 
19, 2013, the Group announced that, subject to the Company's shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 
2013, it has agreed to purchase 175 new Boeing 737 800NG aircraft during the periods Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 
2019.
 8.  Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR149.7m at March 31, 2012 to EUR221.2m at 
March 31, 2013 is comprised of a gain of EUR71.5m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012 to EUR1.389 
per share at March 31, 2013.  In February 2013, the EU commission announced its decision to prohibit 
Ryanair's latest offer (June 2012) for the full share capital of Aer Lingus.  Ryanair is appealing this 
decision in the European Courts.
 9.  Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties.  The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Introduction
 For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures and comments are by 
reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the prior year exceptional item referred to below.  A 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
reconciliation of the results for the year under IFRS to the pre exceptional results is provided in Note 
9.
 There were no exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2013.  The exceptional item in the year ended 
March 31, 2012 relates to a one-off release of ticket sales revenue of EUR57.8m, net of tax, due to a 
change in accounting estimates arising from enhancements to our Revenue Accounting Systems.
 Profit after tax in the year ended March 31, 2013 increased by 13% to EUR569.3m compared to adjusted 
profit after tax in the year ended March 31, 2012.  Including exceptional items, the profit after tax for 
the year increased by 2% from EUR560.4m to EUR569.3m.
 Summary year ended March 31, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 13% to EUR569.3m compared to EUR502.6m in the year ended March 31, 2012 
primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by an 18% increase 
in fuel costs. Total operating revenues increased by 13% to EUR4,884.0m as average fares rose by 6%.  
Ancillary revenues grew by 20%, faster than the 5% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR1,064.2m due to a 
combination of an improved product mix and the roll out of reserved seating across the network.  Total 
revenue per passenger, as a result, increased by 8% whilst Load Factor remained flat at 82% compared to 
the year ended March 31, 2012.
 Total operating expenses increased by 12% to EUR4,165.8m, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, 
the higher level of activity, operating costs associated with the growth of the airline and the strength 
of sterling to the euro.   Fuel, which represents 45% of total operating costs compared to 43% in the 
prior year, increased by 18% to EUR1,885.6m due to the higher price per gallon paid and increased activity 
in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 3%, including fuel unit costs rose by 8%.  
Operating margin increased by 1 point to 15% whilst operating profit increased by 16% to EUR718.2m.
 Net margin remained flat at 12%, compared to March 31, 2012.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 39.45 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 
34.10 euro cent at March 31, 2012.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR43.4m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,559.0m and Gross debt fell by EUR126.9m to 
EUR3,498.3m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR1,023.5m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR310.7m, a dividend of EUR491.5m, debt repayments, and a EUR67.5m share buy-back 
programme.  As a result the Group has moved to a net cash position of EUR60.7m at year end (March 31, 2012 
net debt EUR109.6m).
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 13% to EUR569.3m primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenues offset by an 18% rise in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 13% to 
EUR4,884.0m primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares, a 5% rise in passenger numbers and strong 
ancillary revenue.  Fuel, which represents 45% of total operating costs, compared to 43% in the prior 
year, increased by 18% to EUR1,885.6m due to a higher price per gallon paid and increased activity in the 
period.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 3%, including fuel unit costs rose by 8%.  Operating margin, as 
a result of the above, increased by 1 point to 15% whilst operating profit increased by 16% to EUR718.2m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 13% to EUR4,884.0m primarily due to a 6% rise in average fares 
which was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro, a 5% increase in passenger numbers 
to 79.3m and strong ancillary revenues.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 8%, primarily due to a 6% increase in average fare and strong growth 
in ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 11% to EUR3,819.8m due to a 6% rise in average fares and a 5% 
increase in passenger numbers, and was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro.  Load 
factor remained flat at 82%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 20% to EUR1,064.2m, faster than the 5% increase in passenger numbers, due 
to a combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network, and 
higher internet related revenues.
 Total operating expenses increased by 12% to EUR4,165.8m due to the 18% rise in fuel costs, increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline, and the negative impact of the strength of sterling to 
the euro.
 Staff costs increased by 5% to EUR435.6m due to a 4% increase in flight hours and a 2% pay increase for 
flight crew granted in April 2012.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR329.6m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and more 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this year (March 31, 2013: 246) compared to the prior year 
(March 31, 2012: 235).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 18% to EUR1,885.6m due to higher fuel prices and the increased activity in 
the year.
 Maintenance costs increased by 16% to EUR120.7m, due to the higher level of activity, line maintenance 
costs arising from the launch of new bases and handback provisions for leased aircraft.

Body
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to 
the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The 
objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual 
routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/ (loss) after tax of the 
Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as 
the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the 
Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 11.      Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the year amounted to EUR310.7m and is primarily aircraft purchases.
 12.     Share buy-back
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0m ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5m.  This 
trade settled in early April 2012.  This is equivalent to approximately 1.0% of the Company's issued share 
capital. All ordinary shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 
15.0m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.1m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.1m. The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 13.     Dividend
 At the Company's AGM on September 21, 2012, a dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary share was approved by the 
shareholders. The dividend totalling EUR491.5m was paid to shareholders on November 30, 2012.
 14.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the year ended March 31, 2013 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -6-
related party transactions described in the 2012 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.     Post balance sheet events
 On March 19, 2013 the Company announced that it would issue a Class 1 circular to shareholders seeking 
their approval for the purchase of 175 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, with a list value of over US $15bn, 
in advance of an EGM.  The EGM will take place on June 18, 2013.  In accordance with the terms of the 
contract entered into with Boeing, the Group made stage payments to Boeing in April and May 2013 in 
relation to the purchase of these aircraft.  Such payments are fully refundable in the event that the 
contract is not approved by the Company's shareholders at the EGM on June 18, 2013.

savings of EUR104.2 million for the Group. As indicated in our 2012 preliminary results announcement, we remain 
acutely aware of the need to continue to manage our cost base and we indicated our intention to proceed with a 
number of local rather than centrally driven initiatives. With this in mind, we have begun to make some changes to 
our organisational structure, starting at the senior management level, which will reduce management overhead over 
the course of 2013. We are also launching a voluntary severance programme with the goal of reducing headcount 
by approximately 100 staff by the end of the year.
Pensions
 ---------
There has been no change to the pension risks and uncertainties, a detailed description of which was set out in our 
2012 annual report, published on 8 March 2013. Aer Lingus continues to engage with parties involved in the IASS 
and the Pilots' Scheme, alongside representatives of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC), the 
Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Labour Court with a view to resolving the funding deficits in both 
schemes. The discussions are complex and there can be no certainty that agreement would be reached between all 
parties involved. We have made it clear to all parties that shareholder approval will be sought for any agreement 
that may be reached.
 Further updates will be provided as appropriate.
Capital Reduction
 ------------------
On 15 March 2013, the High Court confirmed Aer Lingus' EUR500 million capital reduction application, thereby 
increasing the distributable reserves of Aer Lingus Group plc to approximately EUR542 million, before the proposed 
payment of a four cent per share dividend (approximately EUR21.4 million) in respect of 2012.  The confirmation 
Aer Lingus Group PLC Q1 2013 Interim Management -3-
provides the Group with greater flexibility to consider a return of capital or the redemption or repurchase of shares, 
in excess of the limits previously imposed by the Company's balance sheet.
 The confirmation of the capital reduction is subject to the condition that notice be provided to the trustees of the 
IASS and the Pilots' Scheme (together the "Schemes"), if a proposed distribution would cause the aggregate of the 
distributable and non distributable reserves  of the Company to be less than the aggregate of the deficits in the 
Schemes attributable to the current or former employees of Aer Lingus Limited (or SR Technics (Ireland) Limited 
while it was an associated company of Aer Lingus Limited). This condition is therefore a mere notice requirement 
only and does not provide the trustees of the Schemes with any rights to limit any distribution that may be proposed 
by the Company in the future.
Ryanair Offer/UK CC
 --------------------
On 27 February 2013, the European Commission formally announced its decision to prohibit Ryanair's third 
takeover offer for the Group.
 Aer Lingus continues to cooperate with the UK Competition Commission ("UK CC") in its investigation into 
Ryanair's continued 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus. The UK CC investigation began following the referral by the 
UK's Office of Fair Trading on 15 June 2012, which observed that "there is a realistic prospect that its stake has 
resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition." A decision from the UK CC on its investigation is 
expected to be announced late Summer 2013.
Commercial Developments
 ------------------------
On 21 February 2013, Aer Lingus and JetBlue Airways announced a codeshare agreement, expanding the 
previously existing interline partnership between the carriers' networks. The start of this codeshare arrangement 
coincided with Aer Lingus' move of its New York JFK flight operations from Terminal 4 to JetBlue's acclaimed 
Terminal 5 on 3 April 2013.
 On 27 March 2013, Aer Lingus and United Airlines announced an expansion to the carriers' codeshare agreement. 
The expansion will allow Aer Lingus to codeshare on United's year round Dublin to Washington-Dulles service and 
also the seasonal United service between Shannon and Chicago. United will codeshare on Aer Lingus flights 
between Shannon and London Heathrow as well as Aer Lingus services from Dublin to Manchester and 
Birmingham.
 On 31 March 2013, Aer Lingus started services on behalf of Virgin Atlantic on domestic UK services connecting 
London Heathrow with Manchester, Aberdeen and Edinburgh under a wet-lease agreement agreed in December 
2012.
 In April 2013, Aer Lingus completed an agreement with Nova Airlines AB ("Novair") for the wet-lease of an Airbus 
A330-200 aircraft on ACMI (aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance) terms. Under the agreement, Aer Lingus will 
operate charter services on behalf of Novair for the next two winter seasons with the option of a third.
 On 8 April 2013, Aer Lingus and Etihad Airways announced an extension of the carriers' codeshare arrangement 
for transatlantic flights. Etihad now have access to offer codeshare flights from Dublin to Boston, Chicago and New 
York.
 In April 2013, Aer Lingus agreed the damp-lease of three Boeing 757 aircraft to operate on North Atlantic services 
starting in early 2014.
Outlook
 --------
Our long haul capacity in Summer 2013 will be higher than in 2012 owing to the additional A330 aircraft, which will 
expand services to Boston and Chicago. Short haul capacity will be lower owing to changes in our route network 
and the impact of lower gauge A319 aircraft operating certain short haul services.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Q1 2013 Interim Management -3-
 While we currently have only limited visibility over booking patterns for the second half of 2013, our present level of 
total bookings for the remainder of 2013 is ahead of the equivalent level at this time last year. The indications are 
that the long haul market is strong enough to absorb the additional capacity we have introduced.
 Trends identified in Q1 2013, including higher airport charges, the strength of long haul and the softness in GBP 
and our UK market have the potential to remain a feature for the rest of the year. On that basis, we currently expect 
2013 operating profit, before exceptional items, to be broadly in line with last year.

 Re:      Proposed Disposal of a Heathrow Slot Pair to British Airways
 Dear Sirs
 This letter is being sent to you in accordance with the notification requirement in Article 10(b) of the 
Articles of Association of Aer Lingus Group plc.
 Aer Lingus has a summer only overnight slot pair, namely a late evening arrival 22.00 and early morning 
departure 06.50 (local times) which is surplus to the airline's requirements (the "Surplus Slot Pair").  
This Surplus Slot Pair must now be operated for summer 2013 in accordance with the 80/20 "use-it, or lose-
it" rule imposed by the EU Slot Regulation or be returned to the slot pool.
 The Surplus Slot Pair is not required to deliver the required capacity for Aer Lingus on its London 
Heathrow routes for the summer season as Aer Lingus already has slots which closely coincide with these 
times (namely (i) arrival 21.25 and early morning departure 06.40 and (ii) arrival 22.25 and early morning 
departure 07.30 local).   If Aer Lingus were to operate the Surplus Slot Pair to a level fulfilling the 
80/20 requirement, it would incur significant operational costs and these costs would not be offset in any 
way by incremental revenue as there is no commercial requirement for additional capacity at these timings 
and frequencies.
 Under Regulation EC 793/2004, slots may not be sold but may be exchanged one for one with other airlines.  
In order to realise reasonable value in respect of Surplus Slot Pair which will otherwise be returned to 
the slot pool for no consideration, it is proposed that Aer Lingus enter into a transaction with British 
Airways whereby Aer Lingus will transfer its interest in the Surplus Slot Pair to British Airways on a 
permanent basis for agreed consideration.  A value is not attributed to the Surplus Slot Pairs in the 
accounts of Aer Lingus as Aer Lingus' right to the slot pair is based on the grandfather rights recognised 
in Regulation EC 793/2004.
 The transfer of this slot pair will not have any impact on Aer Lingus' existing services to Heathrow from 
Dublin, Cork or Shannon.  Aer Lingus therefore considers that the proposed transaction does not raise any 
issues under the Ministerial Guidelines published in 2006 at the time of Aer Lingus' IPO.
 If the proposed transaction as outlined above is implemented, Aer Lingus agrees that any transaction 
relating to the summer slot pair with arrival time 13:00 and departure time 13:50 (which is currently 
excluded from the definition of a Disposal Transaction in Article 10(a) of the Articles of Association of 
Aer Lingus Group plc) will be considered to be a Disposal Transaction subject to the requirements of 
Article 10.  Consequently, there will be no change to the number of slot pairs which will remain subject 
to the provisions of Article 10 of the Articles of Association following the proposed transaction.
 As you are both shareholders holding at least 20% of the Ordinary Shares in the Company, we note that you 
may request in writing for the Company to convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in 
accordance with Article 10(c) provided that this is done within 28 days of the giving of this 
notification.  If you do not require the convening of an extraordinary general meeting as described above, 
we should be grateful if you would advise us accordingly as soon as possible.
 Yours faithfully

Investment Manager's Report
Overview
 Both the Company's share price and underlying NAV increased over the six months
 to 28 February 2013, with the share price increasing by 30.7% and the underlying
 NAV rising by 26.3%. By way of comparison, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index
 increased by 21.9% during the same period (all percentages calculated in sterling
 terms with income reinvested).
Europe made strong progress during the second half of 2012. Mario Draghi made
 it clear that the European Central Bank would support the Euro, 'whatever it
 takes', and this alleviated the potential break-up risk of the single
 currency. German attitudes towards European support of the weaker nations
 softened, and the German Constitutional Court ratified the European Stability
 Mechanism, an important (if broadly expected) step. European equities rose
 sharply and the Euro appreciated. While we still lacked a fundamental turning
BlackRock Grtr Eur Half-yearly Report -2-
 point in the economy, the risk of a meltdown in the Eurozone had been removed
 for the time being and European equities began to look increasingly
 attractive. Investor allocation to the region rose as a consequence.
Consequently, markets performed strongly in response to the continued progress
 at the European political level, with improving prospects for global growth
 driving a rally into the end of the year. In October we saw stronger data from
 the US, and in November the German IFO business confidence indicator rebounded
 and purchasing manager indices began to reflect an increase in business
 expectations for the coming period both in the Eurozone and abroad. This mood
 of optimism continued throughout January, as investors looked through a muted
 beginning to the corporate earnings season and instead focused on the
 potential for an economic re-bound in the second half of 2013. The end of the
 six month period, however, reminded us of the fragility of the situation in
 southern Europe as the Italian electorate voted against the established
 parties and consequently against additional austerity, causing further
 volatility in the market.
Stock selection was the significant driver of the Company's strong performance
 during the period, especially within consumer services and consumer goods. The
 portfolio also benefited from the use of gearing. The allocation of capital at
 a sector level was also beneficial to returns, especially through the decision
 to avoid telecoms and utilities, both of which continued to underperform the
 broader market.
Within consumer services, two positions in short-haul airline businesses
 gave the best returns over the period. A holding in Irish airline Ryanair
 performed strongly as yields proved better than expected during the second half
 of the year and a position in German airline Deutsche Lufthansa benefited from
 a new cost-cutting programme put in place by the management team and the report
 of very strong performance for the third quarter of 2012. Also, within consumer
 goods, a holding in Swiss luxury goods company Richemont rose after reporting a
 continuation of strong organic growth trends, even in domestic Europe and
 despite concerns over a slow-down in Chinese economic growth over the summer
 of 2012.
Within technology, Dutch semiconductor company ASML also aided performance. It
 appeared that the semiconductor equipment order cycle was bottoming and ASML
 could report improved performance as we entered 2013. Also, in January, the
 company gave more clarity on its next generation semiconductor tool which is
 the foundation for ASML's next significant up-cycle. Within industrials, a
 long-held position in Finnish elevator and escalator company Kone performed
 strongly after the company reported strong new equipment sales in its Chinese
 business and the prospects for increased margin expansion in its servicing
 business in key new markets.
BlackRock Grtr Eur Half-yearly Report -2-
Stock selection within the oil & gas sector was the greatest cause of
 disappointment within the portfolio over the period. Specifically, positions
 in CGG Veritas, a French geophysical services company, and Technip, a French
 based project management, engineering and construction company for the energy
 industry, underperformed, especially in December as the former suffered from a
 delay in a deal with Fugro. A position in Italian energy services stock Saipem
 also underperformed as the management team resigned over an enquiry into
 contracts previously won by the company in North Africa.
At the end of the period, the portfolio was particularly weighted towards
 holdings in the basic materials, consumer goods and consumer services sectors.
 Within materials, the portfolio was focused on higher quality global companies
 in the chemicals and crop protection industries. In the consumer-related areas
 of the portfolio, we favoured globally branded businesses with sustainable
 pricing power and higher barriers to entry. The portfolio had lower exposure
 to the utilities and financials sectors as neither offered sufficient growth
 prospects in our view and both remained subject to high regulatory burdens.
 The portfolio also had broadly higher weightings in the technology and health
 care sectors and lower weightings in telecoms, oil & gas and industrials.
The Company's weighting in Emerging Europe marginally increased during the
 period from 6.0% to 7.6% as the MSCI Emerging Europe 10/40 benchmark returned
 16% (in sterling terms). The holdings in Emerging Europe that contributed to
 performance included positions in Hungarian bank, OTP, and Russian
 telecommunication provider, Mobile TeleSystems.  OTP returned 37% as the shares
 benefited from the general improvement in sentiment towards European risk, as
 well as a company specific improvement in non-performing loan formation.  Mobile
 TeleSystems rallied, with the shares benefiting from strong growth in data usage
 in Russia.  The Company's holding in Russian internet company, Mail.Ru,
 detracted from performance over the period.  Reported results from Mail.Ru were
 strong but the shares were held back by a large placement of stock by one of the
 major shareholders.
Outlook
 Following a trough in activity in the summer of 2012, some global leading economic
 indicators have been improving from their lows and we believe that the outlook for
 2013 appears brighter than it was for 2012. The earnings growth profile for
 European companies remains supportive, although the recent currency moves could
 put some pressure on the ability of European exporters to deliver very strong
 earnings growth. Exposure to the region amongst global investors remains low
 compared to historic norms, even though flows recently have been increasing.
 Valuations of European equities are undemanding and the market should continue
 to be supportive in the mid-term, underpinned by attractive dividend yields
 relative to bonds and corporate earnings growth.

Ten Largest Investments
 28 February 2013
Roche - 5.6% (2012: 4.9%) is a Swiss pharmaceuticals and diagnostics company
 with global exposure. Roche has gone through a strong period of growth but has
 now transitioned to focusing on profitability and improving shareholder
 returns. Continued cost control, combined with a growing and attractive
 dividend yield and robust earnings growth, make this an attractive investment
 case.
Novo Nordisk - 4.9% (2012: 4.8%) is a Danish pharmaceuticals company and the
 dominant global franchise in diabetes treatment. The company has high levels
 of market share in Asia ex-Japan, which is a rapidly growing market for
 insulin demand, and we believe that the company has significant potential to
 continue its strong track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth
 per year for the foreseeable future.
BASF - 4.0% (2012: 3.7%) is a global diversified chemicals company, with
 product ranges including plastics, coatings, chemicals, agricultural products
 and oil and gas. The company is a key beneficiary of global growth trends and
 we initially bought into the stock at a cheap valuation following a period of
 strong downgrades in the market. We remain positive about the stock given its
 attractive valuation and exposure to growth in the global economy.
Zurich Insurance Group - 3.9% (2012: 3.8%) is a Swiss-based insurance company.
 The company is relatively defensive compared to the broad insurance sector due
 to its exposure to non-life products and has a resilient balance sheet in our
 view. The company also offers a high and stable dividend yield and has a solid
 management team.
Sanofi - 3.7% (2012: nil) is a French-based pharmaceuticals company. Sanofi
 discovers, develops and distributes therapeutic solutions focused on patients'
 needs. The company has attractive exposures through its emerging market
 business and offers further potential for cost cutting. The stock is currently
 priced attractively relative to its solid earnings growth profile and dividend
 yield.
Swiss Re - 3.7% (2012: 3.2%) is a Swiss re-insurance business. The attraction
 of the company lies within its strong underwriting skills, defensive asset
 allocation, high dividend yield and more active management of spare capital.
 The company's solvency ratios, based on the Swiss Solvency Test, remain strong
 and it has very little exposure to the peripheral European countries in its
 investment portfolio. We view the stock as a resilient business with an
BlackRock Grtr Eur Half-yearly Report -2-
 attractive and sustainable dividend yield.
Compagnie Financière Richemont - 3.6% (2012: nil) is a Swiss luxury goods
 company and the owner of Mont Blanc, Jaeger LeCoultre, Cartier, Alfred Dunhill
 and a number of other well-known brands. Richemont offers attractive exposure
 to consumption growth, especially in Asia and other high-growth global

Body
 The period ended on a positive note with greater than expected progress outlined in the closing statement from the 
Euro area summit but a comprehensive resolution to the fundamental problems of over-leverage and a lack of 
growth remains some way off.
 Performance
 On 13 April SWIP announced that, in response to changing client needs, it would further reposition its GBP54 
billion equities business. As a result of these changes, SWIP announced its resignation as Investment Manager of 
UK Select Trust Limited and at the same time James Clunie took over responsibility for the portfolio from Peter 
Cockburn for the remainder of the notice period.
 This was a mixed, but overall disappointing, period of performance for the Company.  Performance in the first 
quarter of 2012 was strong, with returns well ahead of the FTSE All-Share benchmark.  Holdings in Indus Gas, 
Essar Energy and iEnergizer were amongst the most significant positive contributors.  Over the next three months 
performance was much weaker, giving back all of the gains of the earlier period.  In part that performance was 
driven by the market's reaction to the changes being effected within SWIP's equity business.  As a result, share 
prices of a number of the Company's largest holdings came under pressure, unrelated to the long term 
fundamentals underpinning those investments.
 Portfolio activity
 During the first half of 2012 the Company continued to be defensively positioned, reflecting concerns over the 
potential for a slowdown in Chinese growth together with on-going developments around the Eurozone crisis.  We 
sold positions in Indus Gas, Smiths Group and Ryanair and reinvested proceeds in a number of new holdings. 
These included Imperial Tobacco, Sage Group and BAE Systems.  Having entered the year with no exposure to the 
banking sector, we also added both HSBC Holdings and Royal Bank of Scotland to the portfolio.

 Investment Manager's Report (continued)
 Threadneedle - covering the period 31 July 2012 to 31 December 2012
UK Select Trust Limited Annual Financial Report -2-
 We were delighted to be appointed as the Company's investment manager and assumed responsibility for the 
portfolio from 31 July 2012.  The first action we took was to realign the portfolio to reflect our UK Equity Alpha 
Strategy which was completed on the first day via a program trade. This strategy seeks to deliver consistent 
performance above the FTSE All-Share using a broadly diversified portfolio of 50-90 stocks. At the portfolio level 
diversification is a key driver of portfolio construction. The aim is to diversify the portfolio by investment theme, 
growth drivers, style and market capitalisation such that the Company is never a one way bet on any of these 
factors.
 Market Background
 During the third quarter UK equity markets remained volatile against the backdrop of on-going uncertainty over the 
global economic outlook, ending August and September moderately higher.  However during the fourth quarter UK 
equity markets made solid gains, boosted by some further easing in Eurozone tensions and some more reassuring 
domestic economic developments, most notably news that the economy had emerged from recession in the third 
quarter of 2012. At the sector level, higher-beta areas such as IT were supported by a further improvement in risk 
appetite. Financials also performed strongly, amid relief that the macro risks that had threatened a Eurozone 
breakup have eased, at least in the short term.
 Although we believe that the UK and Eurozone are facing a period of subdued economic activity, the UK corporate 
sector remains in good financial health. We believe that this is likely to lead to a pick-up in merger and acquisition 
activity, dividend growth and share buybacks. UK equity valuations continue to look good value versus both history 
and compared with other assets classes, such as cash or bonds. The UK's relatively high dividend yield remains an 
attractive characteristic given the historically low returns on many other income-producing assets. We remain 
positive on the outlook for UK equities overall and will use periods of market weakness to add to our favoured 
holdings at attractive valuation levels.
 Performance Review
 During the period from 1 August to 31 December 2012, the Company outperformed the FTSE All-Share on a gross 
of fees basis.  This has been driven both by good sector allocation and good stock selection.
 In the third quarter, positive performance was well spread across a number of different stocks, from a variety of 
sectors.  There was also a positive contribution as a result of our zero weighting in Vodafone, as the shares 
suffered due to cash flow concerns and on-going difficulties in its core European markets.  The largest positive 
contribution at the sector allocation level came from the overweight in industrials, where sentiment was boosted by 
optimism that central bank support measures should bolster the global demand outlook. Another positive 
contribution came from our cautious stance towards consumer staples as investors looked beyond traditionally 
defensive areas in search of more attractive earnings growth opportunities.
 As we moved into the fourth quarter we remained cautious on banks; however we established positions in fund 
managers Schroders and St. James's Place on the basis that both firms are well-placed to grow their businesses 
despite the challenging investment backdrop. We also purchased shares in Derwent London, a real estate 
investment trust focused on Central London.  At the sector level, an overweight in consumer discretionary worked 
well, although the underweight in financials detracted. At the stock level, the main detractor was our underweight 
stance towards HSBC, though the effect was offset by our decision to hold no exposure to Vodafone and our 
overweighting of easyJet, which outperformed.
 Our overall strategy has remained very consistent over recent quarters. Despite the UK economy's emergence 
from recession in the third quarter, we believe that the UK and Eurozone are facing the prospect of very subdued 
levels of economic activity for a prolonged period. In this environment, careful stock selection and the avoidance of 
unexpected earnings disappointments will be an important driver of returns.
 However, encouraging economic data releases from China and the US are suggesting that conditions are proving 
more supportive for corporate earnings growth beyond Europe.
 Against this backdrop, we are focusing on finding strong businesses with healthy cash flows and the ability to grow 
earnings and dividends over the long term, in many cases backed by the broad geographic diversification that gives 
such companies exposure to high-growth regions as well as core developed markets. We continue to identify these 
kinds of businesses in a wide range of sectors. We retain our cautious view on UK banks. Although banking shares 
have rallied over recent months as the worst-case Eurozone breakup scenario has been avoided, we believe that 
valuations are unappealing in view of weak domestic consumption and the increasing realisation that banks in the 
UK and the Eurozone may need to raise additional capital. Balance sheet strength remains a theme within the 
Company. As well as providing some protection in tough economic times, a strong balance sheet affords 
UK Select Trust Limited Annual Financial Report -2-
companies the ability to deploy cash in shareholder-friendly ways and boost returns to investors. Given these strong 
corporate balance sheets and low borrowing costs, we expect corporate activity to remain a feature during the 
months ahead as cash rich companies acquire quality assets at attractive prices.
 Outlook
 While the UK's domestic trading environment remains fairly challenging, we believe that the Company's favoured 
holdings are well-positioned to tap into the improving global earnings environment, with over half of UK companies' 
earnings generated outside Europe.
 Meanwhile, given the strength of corporate balance sheets and the availability of cheap funding, we believe that 
the UK market should benefit from an improvement in M&A activity this year, with many valuations still very 
attractive when compared to historical levels. Against this backdrop, our investment process continues to focus on 
well-managed, fundamentally-strong businesses that we believe can deliver positive earnings and, in many cases, 
the ability to support total returns to shareholders through attractive and sustainable levels of dividend pay outs.

 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (4 Apr) celebrated the opening this week of 
its new bases at Eindhoven, Krakow and Zadar, bringing Ryanair's European base network to 54, with an 
additional 3 bases set to open at Chania (Greece), Fez and Marrakech (both Morocco) by the end of April.
 Eindhoven is Ryanair's second Dutch base (following the opening of Maastricht in December) with one-based 
aircraft and 31 routes, which will deliver up to 1.7m passengers p.a. and sustain 1,700* "on-site" jobs, 
as Ryanair invests over $85m at Eindhoven Airport.
 Ryanair also opened its second base in Poland at Krakow, with two-based aircraft and 31 routes, which 
will deliver up to 1.6m passengers p.a. and sustain 1,600* "on-site" jobs, representing a $170m investment 
at Krakow Airport.
 Zadar, meanwhile, is Ryanair's first Croatian base, with one-based aircraft and 17 routes, which will 
deliver up to 300,000 passengers p.a. and sustain 300 "on-site" jobs, as Ryanair invests over $85m at 
Zadar Airport.
 Ryanair celebrated the opening of its three new bases by launching a 100,000 seat sale across its entire 
European network, with prices starting from just GBP12 for travel in May, which are available for booking 
until midnight (24:00hrs) Monday (8 Apr).
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:

 Ryanair, Boeing complete purchase agreement for 175 737-800s
 When finalized, deal will allow Ryanair to grow traffic to more than 100 million passengers per annum, 
and create more than 3,000 new jobs across the airline
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC), today (19 Mar) signed an agreement with the Boeing 
Company to purchase 175 new Next Generation 737-800 airplanes.  When finalised, the deal will be worth 
nearly $15.6 billion at current list prices, and will allow Ryanair to grow its airline to more than 400 
airplanes, serving more than 100 million passengers per year across Europe by the end of the delivery 
stream in 2018.
 The agreement was signed by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and Boeing Commercial Airplanes President CEO Ray 
Conner in New York (19 Mar). Upon approval by Ryanair's shareholders, the purchase will become Boeing's 
largest deal to date in 2013 and will be the largest ever aircraft order from a European airline. It will 
sustain thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in Boeing and its supplier companies and will represent 
the largest ever capital investment by an Irish company in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. jobs.
 These Boeing airplanes will create more than 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers at 
Ryanair's growing number of aircraft bases across Europe. Approximately 75 of these new aircraft will 
replace some of Ryanair's existing fleet of 305 Boeing 737s, but the remainder will drive new growth of  
Ryanair's fleet of young, highly efficient airplanes. These airplanes will allow Ryanair to grow its low-
cost airline service by about 5 percent per annum over the next several years, taking Ryanair's traffic to 
over 100 million passengers by March 2019.
 As Ryanair continues to plan its future as Europe's low-cost airline leader, it continues to evaluate the 
benefits of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft which enters service in 2017.
 Announcing the order, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to sign this agreement with Boeing to purchase 175 new 737-800 jets, which will 
expand our fleet to over 400 units, creating over 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, 
while allowing us to grow our low-cost airline service by about 5 percent per annum over the next several 
years and take our traffic to 100 million passengers by March 2019.
 Ryanair is proud to buy Boeing, who have always made great aircraft and the 737-800 has been the 
cornerstone of Ryanair's success due to its great engineering and phenomenal reliability.  These 175 new 
airplanes will enable us to lower cost and airfares even further, thereby widening Ryanair's cost and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair , Boeing complete purchase agreement
price leadership over other airlines in Europe. They provide Ryanair with the additional capacity to 
exploit substantial growth opportunities that currently exist as many of Europe's flag carrier and smaller 
airlines are restructuring and reducing their short-haul operations.
 Ryanair has the largest fleet of Boeing airplanes in Europe, and today's order will enable Ryanair to 
expand and grow by offering more competition, lower prices, and better choice across the continent of 
Europe. Ryanair is proud to be investing in high-quality US manufacturing and jobs."
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, Ray Conner, said:
 "This purchase agreement is an amazing testament to the value that the Next Generation 737 brings to 
Ryanair. We are pleased that the Next-Generation 737, as the most efficient, most reliable large single-
aisle airplane flying today, has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet. Our 
partnership with this great European low-cost carrier is of the utmost importance to everyone at The 
Boeing Company and I could not be more proud to see it extended for years to come."
 ENDS.

Irish Stock Exchange and, as such, requires the prior approval of Company shareholders. Accordingly, a 
circular in relation to the transaction will be dispatched to shareholders in due course to convene an 
extraordinary general meeting to seek shareholder approval.  The consideration under the agreement will be 
in the form of cash.

 79.3M PAX CARRIED IN 12 MONTHS TO FEB 13 (UP 4 %)
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (5 Mar) released passenger and load factor stats for 
Feb 2013, during which its adjusted monthly traffic fell - as previously guided - by 3% over Feb 2012 as Ryanair 
grounded up to 80 aircraft. Feb 2012 was a leap year and thus had 29 days which accounts for a further 3% drop in 
traffic.
 Ryanair's traffic and load factor stats for Feb 2013 are as follows:

 FERROVIAL/BAA HIKES STANSTED FEES BY 6% FROM APRIL 2013 IN A PARTING GIFT TO MANCHESTER AIRPORT GROUP & A 
PARTING SLAP TO STANSTED'S AIRLINES & PASSENGERS
 RYANAIR TO CUT ITS STANSTED TRAFFIC BY 9% IN RESPONSE TO THESE UNJUSTIFIED & INFLATION-BUSTING INCREASES
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (28 Feb) announced that it will cut its 
London Stansted traffic by 9% over the coming year (from 12.5m to 11.4m) after the Ferrovial/BAA Stansted 
monopoly announced a further unjustified increase of Stansted's already high charges of 6% from April 
2013, despite the fact that Ferrovial/BAA has sold Stansted to Manchester Airport Group (MAG) who will 
take over the airport sometime before the end of March.
 Ryanair has called on Stansted's regulator, the CAA, to investigate whether this unjustified and 
unwarranted 6% price hike was a "sweetener" by Ferrovial/BAA's sale of Stansted, which raised GBP1.5bn in 
proceeds for Ferrovial, despite the fact that Stansted's traffic has declined from 24m p.a. to 17.5m p.a. 
over the last 6 years.
 Ryanair, which had planned to grow its Stansted traffic by 5% from April 2013, will now cut frequencies 
on 43 of its routes and reduce its weekly operations by over 170 flights, with the loss of 1.1m passengers 
(-9%) and over 1,100* jobs at Stansted,  in direct response to this unwarranted and unjustified 6% price 
hike.  Ryanair called on the CAA regulator to explain why Ferrovial/BAA is allowed to hike charges by 6% 
when UK inflation is less than 3% and Stansted's traffic continues to decline.
 Ryanair also called on Ferrovial/BAA to reverse this unjustified and unwarranted price increase before 
the sale to MAG is concluded and further called on MAG to confirm that it will not permit any further 
price increases at Stansted unless, or until, the traffic declines of the past 6 years (during which the 
Ferrovial/BAA monopoly has doubled Stansted's fees) are reversed.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said,
 "It's bad enough that Ferrovial/BAA has doubled prices over the past 6 years and presided over record 
traffic falls at Stansted, but it appears that the CAA now rewards this commercial failure by allowing 
Ferrovial/BAA to again raise fees in 2013 to compensate for its traffic declines in 2012.
 Given that Ferrovial/BAA has now agreed to sell the airport to MAG, it is impossible to understand why 
the BAA monopoly is again raising Stansted's prices from April 2013 when it clearly won't be running the 
airport from that date.  Ryanair and other Stansted airlines now must ask was this surprise price increase 
part of a "sweetener" package to persuade MAG to pay GBP1.5bn for Stansted?  Are passengers and airlines 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO CUT ITS STANSTED TRAFFIC BY 9%
at Stansted again being hit in order to boost the sales proceeds for the Spanish giant, Ferrovial, from 
the sale of BAA Stansted?
 As the London Times has previously commented, the appropriate response to a traffic decline would be to 
lower prices and grow volumes.  Instead the Ferrovial/BAA monopoly, as it runs down the runway trousering 
GBP1.5bn from the sale of Stansted, is imposing a further, unjustified 6% price increase one month in 
advance of MAG's takeover of Stansted.  There's something very smelly about the timing and the scale of 
this price increase, which is more than double the rate of UK inflation.
 Ryanair believes that this price increase, which will clearly be of no benefit to Ferrovial/BAA, was part 
of a "sweetener" to MAG in order to boost the sale price of Stansted Airport.  The CAA must now 
investigate the reasons for this price increase and take action to protect Stansted users from this latest 
example of price gouging from Ferrovial/BAA. "

 Aer Lingus welcomes European Commission prohibition of  Ryanair's offer
 Dublin & London, 27 February 2013: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes the decision announced 
today by the European Commission (EC) prohibiting Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus. This is the first 
occasion on which the EC has needed to block the same deal twice. It is also Ryanair's third failed offer 
for Aer Lingus. The full text of the EC's announcement and frequently asked questions are linked below:
 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-167_en.htm
            http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-144_en.htm
 The number of routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply 
increased since the first offer was blocked in 2007, so the repeated prohibition was always to be 
expected. Aer Lingus is Ryanair's only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes, 
and both business and leisure travellers are well served by the vigorous competition that has been 
preserved between these two carriers.
 Aer Lingus recognises the careful and detailed investigation conducted by the EC. Christoph Mueller, CEO 
of Aer Lingus, said:
 "Aer Lingus' position from the outset has been that Ryanair's offer should never have been made. The 
series of inadequate remedy offers presented by Ryanair only underlines the view that Ryanair made its 
offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance. "
 Aer Lingus continues to cooperate with the UK Competition Commission (UK CC) in its investigation into 
Ryanair's 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus.  The UK CC investigation began following the referral by the 
UK's Office of Fair Trading on 15 June 2012, which observed that "there is a realistic prospect that its 
stake has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition." The announcement of 
Ryanair's bid on 19 June, just four days later, was clearly motivated by a desire to derail the UK CC's 
investigation.
 Aer Lingus remains focussed on financial and operational performance. Aer Lingus is a much stronger 
airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers. The 2012 preliminary results 
announced on 6 February 2013 demonstrated that Aer Lingus delivered an excellent overall performance. 
During 2012, the Company continued to win market share from Ryanair and other competitors, while also 
Aer Lingus Group PLC Aer Lingus welcomes EC prohibition of Ryanair
increasing operating profit, total revenue, passenger numbers, average yields and load factors. Aer Lingus 
is well positioned for future growth and continues to implement its successful 'value carrier' business 
model.

 RYANAIR WILL APPEAL EU COMMISSION'S "POLITICAL" DECISION TO PROHIBIT ITS OFFER FOR AER LINGUS
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (Feb 27) confirmed that it will appeal the EU 
Commission's announced decision to prohibit its latest offer for Aer Lingus, which was supported by an 
historic and unprecedented remedies package that included not one, but two upfront buyers (BA/IAG & Flybe) 
to take over approximately half of Aer Lingus' short-haul business.
 The transfer to these upfront buyers of Aer Lingus' business on the 46 crossover routes identified by the 
EU Commission, together with the relevant slots, aircraft, personnel and branding, was ensured by binding, 
irrevocable commitments by those upfront buyers including Board approvals.
 The history of the EU's treatment of Ryanair's two offers for Aer Lingus conclusively proves that this 
prohibition is a "political" decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government (a 
minority 25% shareholder in Aer Lingus) and is not one that is based on a fair and reasonable application 
of EU competition rules or precedent airline merger approvals in Europe.
 The 2007 EU Prohibition Decision
 In June 2007, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's first offer for Aer Lingus on the basis that 
Ryanair's then remedies package:
 -     did not deliver any upfront buyers or any guaranteed competitor entry; and
 -     did not address all of the identified 35 crossover routes between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair's 2006 offer for Aer Lingus was also hindered by the fact that Dublin Airport (with 24mppa and 
only one terminal) was found to be suffering congestion and entry constraints.
 This is the context in which Ryanair approached the European Commission with its latest 2012 offer for 
Aer Lingus.
 The 2012 EU Statement of Objections
 The Commission accepted that, since traffic had fallen (from 24m to 18m) at Dublin Airport and a second 
terminal had opened in 2010, there were no congestion issues as had existed in 2007.  However, in its 
November 2012 Statement of Objections, the EU Commission raised the following concerns:
 -      Ryanair's commitments did not cover all 46 crossover routes;
 -      The implementation of Ryanair's commitments was unclear because Ryanair had failed to demonstrate 
that upfront buyers would take up all of Ryanair's remedies;
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WILL APPEAL EU COMMISSION'S DECISION
 -      Ryanair's proposed transfer of Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots was legally unclear (despite the fact 
that Heathrow, as part of the Dublin-London city pair, did not require a remedy since this city pair was 
already served by two other strong competitors - BA and Air France);
 -      Ryanair's signed Heads of Terms with potential upfront buyers were not irrevocable or supported by 
Board approvals;
 -      Ryanair's block space agreement (BSA) proposals, under which some crossover routes would be 
addressed by selling seats on Aer Lingus flights to a competitor airline, would not replicate effective 
competition;
 -      There was no provision in the event of failed entry by upfront buyers;
 -      There was a risk that Ryanair and the upfront buyers would not compete aggressively because of 
"long term structural links".
 Ryanair's Comprehensive and Final Commitments Package
 In February 2013 (after a series of meetings with the EU, and associated iterations of its proposals) 
Ryanair submitted a final remedies package  which addressed both the shortcomings in its 2007 remedies 
package and also the concerns raised by the Commission in its November 2012 statement of objections. Its 
key final remedies included:
 -     Instead of BSAs, Ryanair committed to transfer Aer Lingus flights on all 46 crossover routes to 
both BA/IAG and Flybe;
 -     BA/IAG and Flybe signed irrevocable agreements with Ryanair that they would implement the upfront 
buyer (UFB) remedies package, including opening bases at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports;
 -     Ryanair agreed to transfer Aer Lingus existing business and operations on 43 of the 46 crossover 
routes, together with aircraft, personnel, slots and all attendant assets, to Flybe;
 -     Ryanair agreed to transfer both slots and traffic on the remaining 3 of the 46 crossover routes to 
BA/IAG;
 -     Ryanair removed any concerns over the transferability of Heathrow slots by agreeing to transfer 
both Aer Lingus' and Ryanair's Gatwick slots to BA/IAG so that BA could serve Dublin, Cork and Shannon 
from both Gatwick and Heathrow airports with no question mark over slot transferability or the 
implementation of the remedy;
 -     Ryanair addressed the Commission's concerns about the commitment of Flybe to the Irish market by 
undertaking to deliver Flybe Ireland as a commercially profitable and viable entity, with an equity base 
of at least EUR100m to ensure that Flybe Ireland was sustainable for the long term;
 -     Ryanair's remedies package also addressed the Irish Government's stated concerns by preserving Aer 
Lingus' operations (and connectivity) on the Dublin-Heathrow route (despite the fact that much of 
Ireland's connectivity now takes place on connecting services through Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Abu 
Dhabi and Dubai airports). The arrival of BA and Flybe Ireland also ensured that jobs in the sector would 
increase, not reduce;
 -     Furthermore, Ryanair's remedies package resolved all "potential" competition routes (i.e. those 
routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus don't presently compete but might in the future) by offering slot 
divestitures, in perpetuity, to any other airline wishing to enter these potential competition routes.
 EU Market Test Response
 An EU DG Comp market test questionnaire related to Ryanair's final remedy package was circulated to 
relevant parties across Europe and showed that: (1) a clear majority of respondents agreed that the assets 
divested to Flybe were sufficient; and (2) EU airlines representing a majority of air passengers in Europe 
were supportive of key remedies proposed.
 Recent EU Airline Merger Approvals
 Ryanair's remedies package in the Aer Lingus case, which was supported by irrevocable upfront buyer 
agreements from BA/IAG and Flybe, was submitted to the European Commission after the Commission's recent 
approval of other similar airline mergers including BA/IAG's takeover of BMI at Heathrow.  In that case, 
the EU Commission approved BA's purchase of BMI (in Phase 1) despite the fact that the two airlines were 
the number one and number two holders of slots at Heathrow.  Following a "phase one" merger review,  the 
Commission accepted remedies from BA/IAG which involved the transfer of just 12 daily slot pairs to 
competitor airlines to operate competition on just 6 routes from Heathrow. No upfront buyers were required 
and those slots that were offered up to competitors will not be taken up until 12 months after BA/IAG 
completed its takeover of BMI.
 Conclusions
 It is untenable for the Commission to argue on competition grounds why they have rejected what is an 
unprecedented and revolutionary remedies package in the Ryanair/Aer Lingus case just months after they had 
granted phase one approval to a similar IAG/BMI airline merger, which concerned the number one and number 
two airlines based at the heavily-congested London Heathrow Airport.
 In the case of Ryanair and Aer Lingus, which are the number one and number two airlines based in Dublin, 
Ryanair delivered a structural divestment remedy including, not one, but two upfront buyers, irrevocable 
and binding commitments from those two upfront buyers, divestiture of Aer Lingus' flights in each of the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WILL APPEAL EU COMMISSION'S DECISION
46 crossover routes, together with offers of slot divestitures for an unlimited period of time on all 
other potential competition routes.  Ryanair's latest remedies package conclusively addressed all of the 
objections raised by the Commission in its 2007 prohibition decision, and comprehensively resolved all of 
the competition issues raised by the Commission in its November 2012 statement of objections.
 On this basis, Ryanair concludes that it has no alternative to, and very good grounds for, an appeal of 
the prohibition decision to the European Courts.  It is clear that Ryanair, as Europe's only ultra-low 
cost airline, is being held to a different and considerably higher standard by the European Commission 
than any other EU flag carrier airline.
 Given that Ryanair's remedies package would have (1) resulted in not one, but two new competitor airlines 
opening bases at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports; (2) totally devolved more than half of Aer Lingus' 
short-haul business to these airlines; (3) ensured long term competition on these routes from two of the 
UK's largest and well known airline brands; and (4) addressed the Irish Government's stated concerns about 
Heathrow slots, connectivity, jobs and competition, Ryanair does not believe that its remedies package has 
been rejected for any reason other than pandering to the narrow (and misguided) political interests of the 
Irish Government.
 At a time when even Aer Lingus accepts that it has no long term independent future (its CEO, Christoph 
Mueller, stated in July 2011: "We need partners to fulfil our mission to connect Ireland with the world. 
We are too small to do it on ourselves. So we need partnerships.") and at a time when the European 
Commission has rubberstamped every other significant EU airline merger in recent years with considerably 
fewer and less effective remedies than those proposed by Ryanair, this prohibition is clearly not based on 
EU competition rules or any EU airline merger precedent.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "The EU Commission has regrettably reversed its own precedents in order to prohibit Ryanair's offer for 
Aer Lingus.  Ryanair's radical remedies package clearly addressed all of the concerns raised by the EU 
both in its 2007 prohibition and in its November 2012 statement of objections.

Body
 At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger competition champions 
(witness American Airlines' merger with US Airways last week and Emirates' recent strategic joint-venture 
with Qantas) the EU Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while delaying 
much-needed consolidation.
 This decision leaves Aer Lingus as a small, isolated airline and leaves the two Irish airlines at the 
mercy of the Government-owned Dublin Airport monopoly, which continues to increase passenger charges, 
deliver third-rate services and oversee traffic declines.  Over the past 5 years, as Dublin Airport has 
doubled its passenger charges, its traffic has declined from 24m to 18m per annum, while Aer Lingus 
continues to get smaller as it: (1) wet leases short-haul jet aircraft to Virgin to operate new routes 
from Heathrow to regional UK airports (making no contribution to Irish tourism); (2) rents long-haul 
aircraft to charter companies outside of Ireland; and (3) transfers more and more of its short-haul routes 
to smaller, turbo-prop aircraft.
 Ryanair regrets that the EU Commission has again failed to apply its own competition rules and precedents 
in a fair and dispassionate manner.  We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow 
political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for 
appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition. Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its 
legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."

credible and robust competition, including new jobs and bases in Ireland.

 12 February 2013
 RYANAIR TO APPEAL ANY EU PROHIBITION
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, was notified this morning (12 Feb) at a State of Play meeting with 
the EU Commission, that the EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus, despite the 
fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU's Statement of Objections and during 
the review process, including providing the EU - at its request - with irrevocable commitments from not 
one, but two, upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  IAG 
has committed that they would take over divestments of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' entire London-Gatwick 
operations, and Flybe has committed to take over 43 Aer Lingus UK and European routes.
 Given that the EU Commission recently approved IAG's acquisition of BMI at London-Heathrow on the basis 
of three year commitments, the EU's claim that it could not be satisfied of IAG's and Flybe's commitments 
to these Irish routes after three years is another example of the EU  holding Ryanair to a much higher 
standard than any other EU airline. Ryanair's remedies package is unprecedented.  For the first time in EU 
airline history, Ryanair delivered not one, but two, substantial upfront EU airline buyers who have agreed 
to come to Ireland to compete against a combined Ryanair/Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair has today instructed its lawyers to appeal any prohibition decision to the European Courts.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not 
going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules.
 Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's Statement of 
Objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition 
rules.  Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision and we expect to get a fair 
hearing at the European Courts, as we haven't received one from Commissioner Almunia and his case team. 
This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and 
is not based on competition law."

 Aer Lingus responds to Ryanair's statement regarding EU prohibition
 Dublin & London, 12 February 2013: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") notes Ryanair's announcement of 
earlier today that it has been notified by the European Commission (EC) that the EC intends to prohibit 
Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus.
 Aer Lingus has not received any notification from the EC of an intention to prohibit the offer.  
Nonetheless, based upon Ryanair's announcement, Aer Lingus comments as follows:
 As indicated in our statement of 20 June 2012 at the outset of the bid, there was significant uncertainty 
that the offer from Ryanair was ever capable of completion.  Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer 
Lingus was prohibited in 2007 on competition grounds.  Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it 
was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's only significant competitor on the vast 
majority of Irish air routes.  The number of routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and 
Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007.
 The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. 
Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should never have been made.
 As indicated on 6 February 2013, in our preliminary results announcement, Aer Lingus delivered an 
excellent overall performance in 2012. During 2012, the Company increased operating profit, total revenue, 
passenger numbers, average yields, load factors and market share. Aer Lingus is well positioned for future 
growth and continues to implement its successful 'value carrier' business model. We look forward to 
continuing to serve our customers and to providing choice for consumers in the markets we serve.
 Following Ryanair's announcement regarding the EC investigation, Aer Lingus looks forward to continuing 
to assist the UK Competition Commission (UKCC) in its ongoing investigation into the anti-competitive 
effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding. On 15 June 2012, the Office of Fair Trading referred Ryanair's 
minority shareholding to the UKCC for review, concluding that "there is a realistic prospect that its 
stake has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition."
 Ryanair has on a number of occasions attempted to halt this separate UKCC investigation, including by 
means of its third hostile takeover offer.  Aer Lingus now looks forward to the conclusion of the UKCC 
Aer Lingus Group PLC Aer Lingus responds to Ryanair 's statement
investigation. As indicated previously it is Aer Lingus' position that Ryanair, as our largest competitor 
should be required to divest its shareholding in Aer Lingus.

 FLYBE GROUP PLC
 Re: Ryanair Announcement
 Flybe Group plc ("Flybe") notes the announcement made by Ryanair Holdings PLC ("Ryanair") earlier today 
relating to the notification it had received at a State of Play meeting with the EU Commission that the EU 
Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus Group PLC. Flybe is disappointed by this news and 
will await the outcome of the appeal process Ryanair also referred to in that announcement.
 The proposed transaction with Ryanair to transfer a number of aircraft and operating routes to Flybe is contingent 
upon the EC's approval of Ryanair's proposed remedies and a successful bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus.
 Flybe will continue to focus on the delivery of the cost reduction and efficiency plan announced on 23 January 
2013.

 FLYBE GROUP REACHES AGREEMENT WITH RYANAIR TO CREATE FLYBE IRELAND IN THE EVENT OF A 
SUCCESSUL BID BY RYANAIR FOR AER LINGUS
 The Board of Flybe Group plc ('Flybe') has today announced that it has reached agreement with Ryanair Holdings 
PLC ('Ryanair') over the possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating routes as part of a package of 
remedies that Ryanair has submitted to the European Commission DG Competition ('EC'), in the context of its offer 
for Aer Lingus Group PLC ('Aer Lingus')
 The proposed transaction is contingent upon the EC's approval of Ryanair's proposed remedies and a successful 
bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus.  If Ryanair's acquisition of Aer Lingus is completed, Flybe expects to seek formal 
shareholder approval for the acquisition of Flybe Ireland from Ryanair in early Autumn 2013.
 Flybe also announces that it has received irrevocable acceptances representing 64% of the shareholders in 
support of this possible transaction. The European Commission had insisted on the pledging of irrevocable 
acceptances by over 50% of Flybe's shareholders as a condition precedent for the deal to create Flybe Ireland 
proceeding.
 There will be a conference call for analysts and investors at 11am this morning. To register your attendance, 
please contact Helen Tarbet on 020 7457 2025 or helen.tarbet@collegehill.com

SUMMARY
 --      The Board of Flybe has reached agreement with Ryanair to create a well-capitalised, well-funded 
business in Ireland in the event that Ryanair completes the takeover of Aer Lingus.
 --      The Board believes that the opportunity to serve the Irish aviation market is in line with its 
published strategy, and its previous solid track record of successful acquisitions.
 THE TRANSACTION
 --      Flybe has agreed to acquire a new company, Flybe Ireland, from Ryanair for EUR1 million.
 --      Prior to its acquisition by Flybe, Ryanair has agreed to transfer to Flybe Ireland:
 o  43 routes, all within Europe, many to or from current Flybe destinations;
 o  The requisite number of slots and licences to operate the routes;
 o  A minimum of 9 Airbus A320 aircraft;
 o  The requisite number of flight crew, aircraft engineers, management and facilities to operate the 
business;
 o  A cash injection of EUR100 million;
 o  All forward sales cash and liabilities, estimated at a further circa EUR50m in working capital 
funding.
 --      Ryanair in consultation with Flybe will undertake to develop a one year business plan to deliver 
a cost structure that based on the assumption that the preceding year's revenue remains the same, would 
provide EUR20 million in pre-tax profits in the 12 months following the transfer to Flybe Ireland. In the 
event that the business plan does not project EUR20 million in pre-tax profits, there is an agreed 
adjustment mechanism factored into the EUR100 million cash contribution referred to above.
 FLYBE IRELAND
 --      Flybe Ireland will:
 o  Operate from bases in Dublin and Cork;
 o  Operate 43 routes to 34 destinations in Europe. Flybe currently operates to approximately half of 
those destinations in its Flybe UK business;
 o  Deploy Flybe's frequency model on the major city pairs, and its leisure model on the European leisure 
markets;
 o  Have the right to use the Aer Lingus brand for up to three years post the transaction. This will allow 
it to develop its own brand position in Ireland during a realistic transition period.
 COMMITMENTS MADE BY FLYBE TO RYANAIR AS PART OF THE EC REMEDY PACKAGE
 --      Flybe Ireland will be committed to operating an agreed frequency on routes, with the ability to 
terminate a certain number of routes per year whilst maintaining stable capacity in the Irish market.
 --      If Flybe Ireland exceeds the route termination threshold, it will pay a contractual penalty.
 THE EXPECTED TIMETABLE
 Outlined below is the expected timetable:
 --      March 2013
 o  On 6 March 2013, EC is scheduled to give a decision on the competition aspects of Ryanair's bid for 
Aer Lingus.
 o  If the EC gives the agreement for Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus to proceed,  Ryanair may then re-
activate its bid with a view to gaining sufficient acceptances from Aer Lingus shareholders.
 --      May 2013
 o  If the Ryanair bid is reactivated and is successful, Flybe would expect the deal to close on or around 
mid May.
 --      Summer 2013:
 o  If the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus has been successful, Flybe will undertake due diligence on the new 
entity.
 o  It is expected that the Class 1 Circular will be completed and posted to Shareholders in August 2013, 
followed by an EGM for shareholders to vote.
 --      October 2013:
 o  The effective date of the transaction is envisaged to be October 2013 with Flybe Ireland commencing 
operations under Flybe's ownership at the beginning of the 2013/14 IATA winter season.
 WHY THE BOARD BELIEVES THE TRANSACTION TO BE BENEFICIAL TO FLYBE GROUP SHAREHOLDERS
 The Board of Flybe believes that the transaction offers the following benefits to its shareholders:
 --      As stated at IPO, the Group's strategy is to diversify away from its reliance upon UK revenue. 
This opportunity is a good mixture of diversification, and overlap with its existing route network, to 
fulfil this goal.
Flybe Group PLC Agreement with Ryanair
 --      Flybe has existing presence and network points at approximately half of the 34 destinations in 
the 43 route package.
 --      Flybe Ireland will be a well-capitalised company, with approximately EUR150m of cash on the 
balance sheet, including the one off capitalisation by Ryanair, and the transfer of the forward sales cash 
within Aer Lingus at the time of the transaction.
 --      Flybe Ireland will increase Flybe's ability to drive further economies of scale from fleet 
basing, suppliers and airports, as part of this transaction.
 --      Flybe has proven expertise in the acquisition and turnaround of acquired entities:
 --      In March 2007, Flybe acquired British Airways' UK regional airline, BA Connect, a business losing 
GBP40m per year at acquisition. The business was fully integrated into Flybe within 12 months, and made 
profits by the end of its first year of ownership. At the time of its acquisition the business had 39 
aircraft, 1,700 staff and GBP350m of revenue.
 --      In August 2011, Flybe acquired the loss making Finncomm Airlines (Finland based), in a joint 
venture with Finnair. This business has been restructured and refocused, and as a result has delivered 
substantial growth with an expectation of profits in 2013/14 in line with the original acquisition plan. 
The business now has a EUR300m turnover and operates 28 aircraft.
 Commenting on today's announcement Jim French, Flybe's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said:
 "Flybe would be delighted to be granted the opportunity to service the Irish aviation market through 
Flybe Ireland, an airline which would be based in Ireland and dedicated to developing a broad range of 
scheduled services for business and leisure markets.
 "This development of creating a Dublin based airline is in line with the Company's stated strategy at the 
time of IPO - which was to diversify away from reliance upon the UK economy. The terms of the deal 
negotiated ensure that Flybe Ireland will be a well-capitalised, well-funded company, enabling us to 
deliver upon that strategic aim. Flybe has a history of acquiring businesses of scale, restructuring and 
refocusing them and as a result delivering profitable returns. This opportunity plays clearly to that 
corporate strength.
 "Flybe would be proud to have the chance to serve the Irish markets, and would be, as we seek to be 
throughout the rest of Europe, a good employer and corporate citizen.
 "However, before Flybe Ireland can come into being there are many hurdles to overcome, not least the EC 
accepting the remedies offered by Ryanair in its offer to take over Aer Lingus, and then the shareholders 
of Aer Lingus accepting an offer from Ryanair.  However, Flybe has positioned itself well if these events 
come to pass, while in the meantime we continue to focus upon the delivery of the cost reduction and 
efficiency plan we outlined in January".

 Re. Press Speculation
 Flybe Group plc ("Flybe") notes the further press speculation relating to discussions it is having with Ryanair 
Holdings PLC ("Ryanair") in the context of the review by the European Commission of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus 
Group plc ("Aer Lingus"). Flybe confirms that it has reached an agreement in principle with Ryanair about the 
possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating routes as part of a package of concessions Ryanair has 
submitted to the European Commission. The agreement provides for a new company to be incorporated into which 
the relevant business assets (including cash of EUR100 million) and liabilities would be transferred and which Flybe 
would then acquire.
 The agreement has not been approved by the Board of Flybe. It would also be subject to Flybe shareholder 
approval. The implementation of any agreement would be dependent, inter alia, on the status of Ryanair's offer for 
Aer Lingus; the outcome of the Commission's deliberations on the competition aspects of Ryanair's bid; and the 
agreement of a timetable for the implementation of the proposed remedies.

 RYANAIR REPORTS Q3 PROFIT OF EUR18M (UP 21%)
 TRAFFIC UP 3%, AVG FARES UP 8% - F.Y. GUIDANCE RAISED TO EUR540M
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier today (Jan 28) announced Q3 profits of EUR18m, up EUR3m on last 
year despite an EUR81m increase in fuel costs.  Revenues rose 15% to EUR969m as traffic grew 3% to 17.3m 
passengers.  Unit costs rose 11% mainly due to a 24% (EUR81m) increase in fuel.  Excluding fuel Q3 unit costs 
rose by 4%, while avg. fares improved by 8%.

Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
 "Our Q3 profit of EUR18m was ahead of expectations due to strong pre-Christmas bookings at higher yields.  
The 8% rise in avg. fares reflects our improved customer service, record punctuality and the successful 
roll out of our reserved seating service.  Our fuel costs rose EUR81m, (+24%), slightly less than expected 
as oil prices increased 22% (from pbl$84) to pbl$102.  Excluding fuel, Q3 unit costs rose 4% due to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
excessive increases in Italian ATC costs, Spanish airport charges, and the strength of Sterling to the 
Euro.  Ancillary revenue performed strongly and rose 24% to approx. EUR13 per pax.
 New Routes and Bases.
 Our new routes and bases are performing well in their first winter, although some smaller bases such as 
Budapest and Warsaw are doing so at very low prices.  Our 51st base Maastricht opened in December, and we 
will open 6 new bases (total 57) from April in Eindhoven, Krakow, Zadar (Croatia), Chania (Greece), 
Marrakesh and Fez (Morocco).   Significant capacity cuts by Legacy and other struggling EU carriers 
continue to offer us substantial growth opportunities across Europe.   We expect further capacity cuts and 
restructurings in Europe as high fare, loss making carriers struggle to compete with Ryanair's expansion 
at low prices. During Q.3 Iberia, AFKLM, Air Berlin, and Lufthansa all announced major restructurings.  
Both LOT and SAS are seeking further state support while the Swiss charter airline "Hello" has closed.  
These trends will create more growth opportunities for Ryanair to grow profitably to 120m passengers over 
the next decade.
 Customer Service.
 Our industry leading customer service continues to improve as demonstrated by the following YTD 
milestones:-
 --    93% of all Ryanair flights arrived on time (a new record).
 --    Lost bags have fallen to less than 1 per 3,000 pax.
 --    We cancel less than 4 flights in every 1,000.
 No other EU airline can match Ryanair's fares or this level of passenger service.  The addition of 
reserved seating to our priority boarding service in 2012 has been very well received and a recent survey 
of Ryanair's traffic in Spain (where Ryanair is the largest carrier) highlighted that 22% of our 
passengers were travelling on business.  A survey of 10,000 passengers in December also yielded the 
following results:-
 --   87% were satisfied or very satisfied with their Ryanair flight.
 --   93% said they would fly Ryanair again.
 --   95% said Ryanair provide excellent value for money.
 Ryanair Strengths.
 Ryanair's ex fuel passenger cost of EUR27 (ytd) is lower than any carrier in Europe.  Our average fare of 
EUR50 is (by some distance) lower than any other EU carrier.  Our tight cost management, at a time when 
competitor costs are rising faster, will enable Ryanair to expand our price and cost leadership over all 
other EU airlines for the foreseeable future.  The combination of Ryanair's industry leading costs and 
customer service, strong cash flows and balance sheet, gives Ryanair a unique platform to deliver its next 
decade of growth as we target a 20% share of the EU short-haul market by growing to over 120m pax p.a.
 Stansted Airport Sale
 The sale of Stansted should be completed by the end of Spring.  We welcome its purchase by MAG and look 
forward to working with them (as we do currently in Manchester, East Midlands, and Bournemouth) to grow 
Stansted's low fare traffic back over 23m, where it was in 2007 before the BAA monopoly doubled Stansted's 
fees.  We also welcome the CAA's announcement that is "minded to" rule that Stansted has market power, and 
will need effective regulation to protect Stansted users from exploitation by the airport monopoly 
particularly when "there is evidence to suggest that Stansted is pricing above the competitive level".
 Aer Lingus Update.
 Under Irish Takeover Panel rules we are unable in these results to update on our offer to acquire Aer 
Lingus. Accordingly we are issuing a separate announcement on this matter today.
 Hedging & Balance Sheet.
 We have recently extended our fuel hedges to 75% of FY 14 at pbl$97 and hedges on our fuel exposures at 
$1.32. At current rates our FY14 fuel cost per passenger will rise by approx. 5%, compared to a 14% 
increase in FY13.
 A 2(nd) special dividend of EUR492m (EUR0.34 per share) was paid to shareholders in Q3, bringing to 
EUR1.53bn the funds returned by Ryanair to shareholders over the last five years.  Ryanair's balance sheet 
remains one of the strongest in the industry, with closing Q3 gross cash of EUR3.15bn.  We expect the year 
end net cash to be positive despite directly owning over 70% of our fleet of 305 young Boeing 737-800s.
 Outlook.
 Our Q3 yields were boosted by stronger pre-Christmas bookings, while lower than expected operating costs 
delivered slightly better profits than forecast.  However Q4 traffic (as previously guided) will drop by 
approx.400,000 passengers (-3%)below last year's Q4, due to our grounding up to 80 aircraft which limits 
the impact of high oil prices, high airport fees at Stansted and Dublin, and seasonally weaker Q4 demand.  
On the basis of this improved Q3 result, our capacity cuts and limited visibility over Easter bookings and 
yields, (although we have seen some yield softness in January), we now expect our full year profits to 
exceed our previous guidance (of EUR490m to EUR520m) and rise close to EUR540m, a 7% increase on last 
year's profits despite a 19% increase in our oil costs.

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and 
Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.

 Marketing, distribution & other costs increased by EUR4.3m to EUR45.5m, reflecting higher marketing spend 
per passenger due to the launch of an additional 6 new bases and new routes compared to the quarter ended 
December 31, 2011.  Ancillary costs also rose due to the increased level of sales.
 Operating margin increased by 1 point due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 18% to EUR34.6m.
 Finance income decreased by EUR7.2m to EUR4.8m primarily due to the general decline in interest rates, 
particularly for deposits placed with highly rated financial institutions, which resulted in lower yields.
 Finance expense is down by 14% to EUR24.0m primarily due to lower interest rates in the quarter compared 
to the quarter ended December 31, 2011.

 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.                   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland.  The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the nine months ended December 31, 2012 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2012 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2012, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2012, are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2012 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group 
Accounts) Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 
31, 2012, together with the independent auditor's report thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar 
of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's 
Website.  The auditors' report on those financial statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the interim 
financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2012 on January 25, 2013.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards adopted for the first 
time in the period ended December 31, 2012, which would have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations.
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of 
these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations.
 --      IAS 1 (amendment 2011) "Presentation of items of other comprehensive income" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after July 1, 2012).
 --      IFRS 10, "Consolidated Financial Statements" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2013).
 --      IAS 19 (amendment 2011) "Employee benefits" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2013).
 --      IFRS 11, "Joint Arrangements" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2013).
 --      IFRS 12, "Disclosure of Interests in other Entities" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2013).

 --      IFRS 13, "Fair Value Measurement" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2013).
 --      IAS 27 (amended 2011) "Separate Financial Statements" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2013).
 --      IAS 28 (amended 2011) "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures" (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013).
 --      Amendments to IFRS 7: "Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial         
Liabilities" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013).
 --      Annual improvements to IFRSs (issued May 2012 ) (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2013)
 --      Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendment to IAS 32): (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9 (2010)) (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2015).
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.       Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.      Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine months ended December 
31, 2012 was 12.2% (December 31, 2011: 12.1%).  The tax charge for the nine months ended December 31, 2012 
of EUR84.9m (December 31, 2011: EUR76.7m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary 
differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement and the utilisation of 
previous trading losses.
 5.      Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.5m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.      Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.

 RYANAIR UPDATE ON AER LINGUS
 Further to Ryanair's Q3 results announcement issued today (Jan 28), the following is an update in 
relation to the Aer Lingus offer:
 Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary Said:
 "Ryanair has submitted a radical and unprecedented remedies package to the EU in support of its offer for 
Aer Lingus.  We believe these remedies address every current Ryanair\Aer Lingus crossover route and all 
other competition issues raised by the Commission in its Statement of Objections. The remedies involve two 
upfront buyers each basing aircraft in Ireland to takeover and operate a substantial part of Aer Lingus' 
existing route network and short-haul business.  This will be the first EU airline merger which will 
deliver structural divestitures and multiple upfront buyers.  We look forward to completing our offer for 
Aer Lingus subject to receiving approval from the EU competition authorities in early March".

 At December 31, 2012 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 305 (2011: 282) Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  All firm 
orders for Boeing 737-800's, under the agreement with Boeing, have been delivered in full as at December 
31, 2012 and there are no further aircraft purchase commitments as of December 31, 2012.
 8.      Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR149.7m at March 31, 2012 to EUR176.0m at 
December 31, 2012 is comprised of a gain of EUR26.3m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012 to EUR1.105 
per share at December 31, 2012.  On August 29, 2012 the EU Competition Commission announced that the 
proposed merger would enter a Phase 2 review which is expected to be completed in February 2013.
 9.      Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties.  The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:                                 Nine       Nine

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the nine months amounted to EUR257.4m and is primarily aircraft purchases.
 12.     Share buy-back
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0m ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5m.  This 
trade settled in early April 2012.  This is equivalent to approximately 1.0% of the Company's issued share 
capital. All ordinary shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 
15.0m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.1m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.1m. The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 13.     Dividend
 At the Company's AGM on September 21, 2012, a dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary share was approved by the 
shareholders. The dividend totalling EUR491.5m was paid to shareholders on November 30, 2012.
 14.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 that materially 
affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no 
changes in the related party transactions described in the 2012 Annual Report that could have a material 
effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.     Post balance sheet events
 There are no significant post balance sheet events.

 Profit after tax increased by 10% to EUR613.7m compared to EUR558.4m in the nine months ended December 31, 
2011 primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by a 24% increase in fuel 
costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR4,074.9m as average fares rose by 6%.  Ancillary 
revenues grew by 21%, faster than the 6% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR803.9m due to a combination of 
an improved product mix and the roll out of reserved seating across the network.  Total revenue per passenger, as 
a result, increased by 8% whilst Load Factor remained flat at 84% compared to the period ended December 31, 
2011.
 Total operating expenses increased by 16% to EUR3,327.6m, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, the higher 
level of activity, the strength of sterling to the euro and operating costs associated with the growth of the airline.  
Fuel, which represents 46% of total operating costs compared to 43% in the comparative period, increased by 24% 
to EUR1,539.7m due to the higher price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period. Unit costs excluding 
fuel increased by 3%, including fuel unit costs rose by 9%.  Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 18% whilst 
operating profit increased by 10% to EUR747.3m.
 Net margin was down 1 point to 15%, compared to December 31, 2011.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 42.56 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 37.80 euro 
cent at December 31, 2011.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash decreased by EUR363.8m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,151.8m and Gross debt fell by EUR34.3m to 
EUR3,590.9m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR462.1m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR257.4m, a dividend of EUR491.5m, debt repayments, and a EUR67.5m share buy-back 
programme.  As a result Net debt at period end has increased by EUR329.5m to EUR439.1m (March 31, 2012 
EUR109.6m).
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the nine months ended December 31, 2012
 Profit after tax increased by 10% to EUR613.7m primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenues offset by a 24% rise in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR4,074.9m 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares, a 6% rise in passenger numbers and strong ancillary revenue. 
Fuel, which represents 46% of total operating costs, compared to 43% in the prior year, increased by 24% to 
EUR1,539.7m due to a higher price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel 
rose by 3%, including fuel unit costs rose by 9%.  Operating margin, as a result of the above, decreased by 1 point 
to 18% whilst operating profit increased by 10% to EUR747.3m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR4,074.9m primarily due to a 6% rise in average fares which was 
partially impacted by the strength of sterling to the euro, a 6% increase in passenger numbers to 65.3m and strong 
ancillary revenues.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 8%, primarily due to a 6% increase in average fare and strong growth in 
ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 13% to EUR3,271.0m due to a 6% increase in passengers and a 6% 
rise in average fares, and was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro.  Load factor remained flat at 
84%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 21% to EUR803.9m, faster than the 6% increase in passenger volume, due to a 
combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network, and higher internet 
related revenues.
 Total operating expenses increased by 16% to EUR3,327.6m due to the 24% rise in fuel costs, increased costs 
associated with the growth of the airline, and the negative impact of the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR339.8m due to a 5% increase in flight hours and a 2% pay increase for flight 
crew granted in April 2012.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR249.0m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and more 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this period (December 31, 2012: 246) compared to the nine months 
ended December 31, 2011 (224).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 24% to EUR1,539.7m due to higher fuel prices and the increased activity in the 
period.
 Maintenance costs increased by 12% to EUR86.3m, due to the higher level of activity, line maintenance costs 
arising from the launch of new bases, and handback provisions for leased aircraft.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 8% to EUR72.1m, due to a net increase in leased aircraft from 53 to 55 and the 
negative impact of higher lessor financing costs for 12 new leased aircraft.  We handed back 4 aircraft during the 
period at the end of their leases.
 Route charges rose by 5% to EUR390.0m due to the increased number of sectors flown, offset by a slightly shorter 
sector length.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 12% to EUR490.1m, due to the 7% increase in sectors flown, increased 
charges in Spain, a quadrupling of ATC charges in Italy, the mix of new routes and bases launched, and the 
strength of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs increased by EUR23.5m to EUR160.6m, reflecting higher marketing spend per 
passenger due to the launch of 6 new bases and new routes compared to the period ending December 31, 2011. 
Ancillary costs also rose due to the increased level of sales.
 Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 18% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 10% to EUR747.3m.
 Finance income decreased by 28% to EUR24.3m primarily due to the decline in interest rates, particularly for 
deposits placed with highly rated financial institutions, which resulted in lower yields.
 Finance expense decreased by 7% to EUR76.8m primarily due to lower interest rates in the period compared to 
the nine months ended December 31, 2011.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash decreased by EUR363.8m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,151.8m and Gross debt fell by EUR34.3m to 
EUR3,590.9m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR462.1m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR257.4m, a dividend of EUR491.5m, debt repayments, and a EUR67.5m share buy-back 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
programme.  As a result, Net debt at period end has increased by EUR329.5m to EUR439.1m (March 31, 2012 
EUR109.6m).
 Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR78.3m in the period to EUR3,228.4m due to the payment of a EUR491.5m 
dividend, a EUR67.5m share buy-back, and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives and employee 
share options, offset by the net profit after tax of EUR613.7m.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended December 31, 2012
 Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR18.1m primarily due to an 8% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenues offset by a 24% rise in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR968.8m 
primarily due to an 8% increase in average fares, and a 3% rise in passenger numbers.  Fuel, which represents 
44% of total operating costs compared to 41% in the prior year, increased by 24% to EUR414.8m due to a higher 
price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 4%, including fuel unit 
costs rose by 11%.  Operating margin, as a result of the above, increased by 1 point to 4% whilst operating profit 
rose by 18% to EUR34.6m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR968.8m primarily due to an 8% increase in average fares which 
was partially impacted by the strength of sterling to the euro, a 3% increase in passenger numbers to 17.3m and 
strong ancillary revenues.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 11%, primarily due to an 8% increase in average fare and strong growth in 
ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 12% to EUR748.7m due to a 3% rise in passenger numbers and an 
8% increase in average fares, and was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro.  Load factor 
remained flat at 81%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 24% to EUR220.1m, faster than the 3% increase in passenger volume, due to a 
combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network and higher internet 
related revenues.
 Total operating expenses increased by 15% to EUR934.2m due to the 24% rise in fuel costs, increased costs 
associated with the growth of the airline and the negative impact of the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR99.8m due to a 4% increase in flight hours, a 2% pay increase for flight crew 
granted in April 2012, and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 4% to EUR79.1m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity
 and more 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this quarter (December 31, 2012: 246) compared to the quarter ended 
December 31, 2011 (224), partially offset by timing adjustments related to lower winter activity levels.
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 24% to EUR414.8m due to higher fuel prices and the increased activity in the period.
 Maintenance costs increased by 4% to EUR28.6m, due to the higher level of activity, line maintenance costs 
arising from the launch of new bases and handback provisions for leased aircraft.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 5% to EUR24.5m, due to a net increase in the number of average leased aircraft 
from 55 to 56, and the negative impact of higher lessor financing costs for 12 new leased aircraft.  We handed back 
4 aircraft in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 at the end of their leases.
 Route charges rose by 5% to EUR104.8m due to the increased number of sectors flown, offset by a slightly shorter 
sector length.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 13% to EUR137.1m, due to the 3% increase in sectors flown, increased 
charges in Spain, a quadrupling of ATC charges in Italy, the mix of new routes and bases launched and the 
strength of sterling to the euro.

 Re: Press Speculation
 Flybe Group plc ("Flybe") notes the press speculation relating to discussions it is having with Ryanair Holdings PLC 
("Ryanair") in the context of the review by the European Commission of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus Group plc. 
Flybe confirms that it is in discussion with Ryanair about the possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating 
routes as part of a package of concessions Ryanair has submitted to the European Commission. These discussions 
however, are non-binding and non-exclusive. Additionally, the discussions are also highly conditional given the 
status of Ryanair's offer, the uncertainty of the outcome of the Commission's deliberations and the expected lead 
times around any implementation of the proposed remedies.

 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 2 NEW BASES IN MOROCCO
 "Ryanair is delighted to announce our first 2 bases in Morocco at Fez (No 56) and Marrakech (No 57) and 
to launch 2 new Morocco airports at Essaouira and Rabat, with flights starting in April. To celebrate our 
new Moroccan bases and airports, we are launching a 100,000 seat sale with fares starting from EUR15 for 
travel across Europe in February and March. Seats at these crazy low prices will be snapped up quickly, so 
we urge passengers to book them immediately on            www.ryanair.com."
 Dr. Lahcen Haddad, Minister of Tourism of the Kingdom of Morocco said:
 "The Moroccan tourism sector is very proud of the confidence Ryanair is showing in the capacity of the 
Moroccan destination to grow and develop to become a leading market in the Mediterranean region.  This 
long-term commitment, as shown in the implementation of two bases in Fez and Marrakesh, and the opening of 
two new destinations (Essaouira and Rabat), is the first stage of a comprehensive strategy aiming, for 
Ryanair, to build a profitable business based on the huge growth potential of Moroccan tourism, as planned 
within the framework of Vision 2020. The Moroccan Ministry of tourism is convinced that an efficient 
growth strategy can only succeed if it takes into consideration the emergence of new tourism products, the 
need for an adequate air service as well as for an efficient marketing activity. Through MNTO, we will 
strengthen our marketing efforts in the main source markets at which Ryanair will increase its air 
services to Morocco."
 * ACI research confirms up to 1,000 'on-site' jobs are sustained at international airports for every 1m 
passengers

 RYANAIR WELCOMES CAA'S "MARKET POWER" ASSESSMENT AT STANSTED
 Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, welcomed today's (20 Dec) publication by the CAA of its "minded 
to" assessment of Stansted's market power.  The CAA is minded to rule that Stansted has market power, and 
accordingly must be subject to effective regulation to protect the reasonable interests of Stansted's 
users (airlines and passengers) from exploitation by the BAA Stansted monopoly.  In particular Ryanair 
welcomes the CAA's finding that "Stansted is pricing to its regulatory price cap and there is evidence to 
suggest that it is pricing above the competitive level".  The CAA has commissioned an independent 
benchmarking study which shows that Stansted's prices are likely to be above the level of comparator 
airports.
 Ryanair believes that this finding vindicates the earlier ruling of the Competition Commission, that the 
CAA's "inadequate" regulatory regime has adversely effected competition and users at Stansted.  Over the 
past five years from 2007 to 2011, the BAA Stansted monopoly has doubled its prices, while traffic has 
declined by 25%. The BAA has repeatedly claimed that this traffic decline is due to "low consumer 
confidence" without explaining why Heathrow and Gatwick have returned to traffic growth.  The ability to 
raise prices, even when other competitive airports are reducing them, is in Ryanair's view compelling 
evidence of BAA Stansted abusing its market power.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "We welcome today's finding by the CAA that Stansted has market power, and that evidence shows it is 
pricing "above the level of comparator airports".  This is why Stansted's traffic has declined in recent 
years, even as Gatwick, Heathrow and other UK airports have returned to growth.
 "Ryanair welcomes the current forced sale of Stansted by the over-charging BAA monopoly, but it is clear 
that any new owner of Stansted will have to be subject to effective regulation, as opposed to the CAA's 
previous inadequate regulator regime.  Effective regulation is the only way to ensure that the interests 
of Stansted users are protected, and Stansted is returned to a low cost, high growth future in the best 
interest of the airport itself, its airline customers and most of all its passengers.
 "Ryanair welcomes today's findings by the CAA and hopes that it will lead to a much more effective 
regulatory regime in future where the new owners of Stansted Airport are forced to run an efficient 
facility and price its services at or below the level of comparator airports."

 UK Court of Appeal rejects Ryanair's challenge to the Competition Commission's jurisdiction over 
Ryanair's minority stake
 Dublin & London, 13 December 2012: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes today's decision by the 
UK Court of Appeal, rejecting Ryanair's attempt to halt the UK Competition Commission's investigation into 
Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair had attempted to force a halt to the investigation in view of Ryanair's renewed attempt to take 
over Aer Lingus: a third hostile takeover offer was announced on 19 June 2012, just a few days after the 
Competition Commission began its Inquiry.  Ryanair's arguments have now been rejected by the Competition 
Commission, the Competition Appeals Tribunal (which ruled on 8 August) and the Court of Appeal. The Court 
of Appeal has also refused Ryanair permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.
 This decision represents the latest in an even longer line of judgments adverse to Ryanair in its 
attempts to derail the UK competition authorities from their review of the minority shareholding - 
Ryanair's previous attempts to prevent the Office of Fair Trading from continuing its investigation also 
failed before the Competition Appeals Tribunal, the Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court (which declined 
even to hear the appeal).  On 15 June, the Office of Fair Trading then referred the review of Ryanair's 
minority shareholding to the Competition Commission, concluding that "there is a realistic prospect that 
its stake has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition."
 The European Commission is meanwhile continuing its examination of Ryanair's takeover bid and recently 
served Ryanair with its formal Objections to the takeover.
 Aer Lingus looks forward to continuing to assist the Competition Commission in its investigation into the 
anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding.  Colm Barrington, Chairman of Aer Lingus, 
said:
 "Today's appeal judgment is a key milestone on the path toward Ryanair being required to divest its 
shareholding in Aer Lingus."

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
During the month, the Company's NAV rose by 4.9% and the share price rose by
 2.9%.  For reference, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index increased by 3.8%
 during the same period.
European equities enjoyed a positive month in November.  The buoyant mood in
 equity markets was also reflected by the further contraction in sovereign bond
 yield spreads, with Spanish and Italian 10 year rates tightening to 5.4% and
 4.5% respectively.
With China's political leadership handover progressing smoothly and Chinese
 economic momentum trending up, consumer-related names with exposure to the
 Asian region have done well in November.  However, relative 'safe-haven'
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 sectors lagged the market, along with commodity-related stocks.
Both stock selection and sector allocation aided returns during the month.  The
 Company's sector allocation, with a larger weighting to technology and a lower
 weighting to utilities, both provided meaningful contributions to returns in
 November.  At a stock level, positions in consumer services and consumer goods
 performed best during November.  Within consumer services, a position in
 Ryanair performed strongly after the company reported stronger than expected
 profits for the previous quarter.  Particularly encouraging was the company's
 ability to deliver growth in the average fare charged on a year-on-year basis.
 Within consumer goods, a position in Swiss luxury goods business Richemont
 also performed strongly, benefiting both from strong profit growth and
 improving sentiment surrounding Chinese consumption.
Elsewhere within the portfolio, positions in German auto supplier Continental
 and French domestic autos name Renault both performed strongly, as did a
 position in Schneider Electric, a French electrical engineering company which
 benefited from an improvement in global lead indicators.  Less successful
 positions included seismic services company CGG Veritas, which suffered from a
 short term delay in its acquisition of Fugro, and Novo-Nordisk which saw some
 profit taking as news surrounding the approval of their new drug came through.
At the end of the month, the Company had higher weights (when compared with the
 FTSE World Europe ex UK Index) in basic materials, oil & gas, industrials,
 consumer services and technology and lower weightings in financials, utilities,
 telecoms and health care.
Outlook
Our outlook on European equities remains positive.  The ECB's policy actions
 have created an environment in which structural reform can take place.  2012
 may be the worst year for austerity in Europe in our view and from 2013 onwards
 we may begin to see incremental improvements on a year-on-year basis.  For
 example, it is noteworthy that Italy's fiscal reforms have caused a -3% drag on
 GDP this year; this is set to fall to a -0.9% drag in 2013.  The global
 economic environment is also supportive for equities next year, assuming that
 the US does not trip on the fiscal cliff issue and we are beginning to see
 evidence that China is now moving beyond its soft patch.  Valuations in Europe
 are very cheap relative to the US, corporate bonds and its own history and this
 remains the case after the rally.  Ownership levels are also very low, and
 further development in the political crisis may bring more assets back into the
 region.

 RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS - VIRGIN LEASE DEAL
 BELIEVES IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AER LINGUS' COMMERCIAL FAILURE
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (10 Dec) criticised the Board and Management of Aer Lingus 
for their latest "wet lease" agreement with Virgin Atlantic, which Ryanair believes is yet another example 
of Aer Lingus' commercial failure and lack of any independent future.
 Ryanair highlighted that this is Aer Lingus' second attempt at such a wet lease type arrangement, 
following the transatlantic "partnership" with United Airlines, which started in March 2010, under which 
Aer Lingus switched one of its transatlantic aircraft, to operate an effective wet lease for United on the 
Washington - Madrid route.  In July 2011, Aer Lingus' CEO Christoph Mueller claimed "We operate the 
aircraft very cost efficiently and United is selling it at very reasonable yields and it works...".  Mr 
Mueller "believes this type of operation could be strategically important for the future".  Yet this 
"strategically important" partnership was ended by United in October 2012 after just 30 months.
 Ryanair called on the Board and Management of Aer Lingus to explain why Aer Lingus is wet leasing 4 of 
its larger A320 aircraft to Virgin to operate routes to/from Heathrow which have no connection with or 
value to Ireland.  Where will these 4 aircraft come from?  Will they be taken from Aer Lingus' existing 
bases at Shannon, Cork or Dublin?  Will this result in yet another decline in Aer Lingus' traffic, which 
has already fallen from 10.4m in 2009 to 9.5m in 2011?  Will Aer Lingus' contribution to Ireland's 
"Grabbing" in 2013 be yet another 1m cut in capacity and traffic to/from the Republic of Ireland?
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "In 2010 Aer Lingus was promising that the United Airlines wet lease "partnership" would be the way 
forward, yet 2 years later United abruptly cancelled the deal and returned the aircraft to Aer Lingus.  
Instead, United have now entered the Washington-Dublin route, which Aer Lingus previously withdrew from.
 Today's announcement that Aer Lingus is to take 4 of its existing aircraft away from Ireland, thereby 
reducing its Irish traffic by up to 1 million passengers annually, so that it can rent these aircraft to 
Virgin Atlantic on a short-term wet lease arrangement seems to be yet another admission that Aer Lingus 
has no commercial strategy or independent future.  What happens in a year or two years time if Virgin 
Atlantic wants to cancel the deal and Aer Lingus is left with 4 aircraft with nothing to do, but has 1 
million fewer core passengers ?
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS - VIRGIN LEASE DEAL
 If, as Aer Lingus claims, their brand and commercial strategy is working, then why are they spray 
painting 4 aircraft in Virgin colours and renting them out, rather than running more routes to/from 
Ireland for the "Grabbing" in 2013?  Ryanair believes that this latest wet lease deal with Virgin is yet 
another sign that Aer Lingus has no viable commercial strategy, a mismanaged and fading brand and no 
independent future."

 ===========  ===========  ===========
* Decrease on prior year due to lower aircraft in operation in March 2012 and cabin crew staff being 
furloughed.
 Ryanair's pilots, flight attendants and maintenance and ground operations personnel undergo training, 
both initial and recurrent. A substantial portion of the initial training for Ryanair's flight attendants 
is devoted to safety procedures, and cabin crew are required to undergo annual evacuation and fire drill 
training during their tenure with the airline. Ryanair also provides salary increases to its engineers who 
complete advanced training in certain fields of aircraft maintenance. Ryanair utilizes its own Boeing 737-
800 aircraft simulators for pilot training.
 IAA regulations require pilots to be licensed as commercial pilots with specific ratings for each 
aircraft to be flown. In addition, IAA regulations require all commercial pilots to be medically certified 
as physically fit. At March 31, 2012, the average age of Ryanair's pilots was 34 years and their average 
period of employment with Ryanair was 4.8 years. Licenses and medical certification are subject to 
periodic re-evaluation and require recurrent training and recent flying experience in order to be 
maintained. Maintenance engineers must be licensed and qualified for specific aircraft types. Flight 
attendants must undergo initial and periodic competency training. Training programs are subject to 
approval and monitoring by the IAA. In addition, the appointment of senior management personnel directly 
involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance and aircraft inspection must be 
satisfactory to the IAA. Based on its experience in managing the airline's growth to date, management 
believes that there is a sufficient pool of qualified and licensed pilots, engineers and mechanics within 
the EU to satisfy Ryanair's anticipated future needs in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and 
quality control and that Ryanair will not face significant difficulty in hiring and continuing to employ 
the required personnel. Ryanair has also been able to satisfy its needs for additional pilots through the 
use of contract agencies.  These contract pilots are included in the table above. In addition, Ryanair has 
also been able to satisfy its needs for additional flight attendants through the use of contract agencies. 
These contract flight attendants are included in the table above.
 Ryanair has licensed approved organizations in Sweden and Holland to operate pilot training courses using 
Ryanair's syllabus, in order to grant Boeing 737 type-ratings. Each trainee pilot must pay for his or her 
own training and, based on his or her performance, he or she may be offered a position operating on 
Ryanair aircraft. This program enables Ryanair to secure a continuous stream of type-rated co-pilots.
 Ryanair's employees earn productivity-based incentive payments, including a sales bonus for onboard sales 
for flight attendants and payments based on the number of hours or sectors flown by pilots and flight 
attendants (within limits set by industry standards or regulations fixing maximum working hours). During 
the 2012 fiscal year, such productivity-based incentive payments accounted for approximately 47% of an 
average flight attendant's total earnings and approximately 37% of the typical pilot's compensation.  
Pilots at all Ryanair bases are covered by four-year agreements on pay, allowances and rosters which 
variously fall due for negotiation between 2013 and 2015. In March 2012, Ryanair agreed to increase the 
pay of pilots and cabin crew in accordance with the terms of individual base agreements. The remaining 
employees who were not covered by base agreements had their salary frozen for a period of 12 months. 
Ryanair's pilots are currently subject to IAA-approved limits of 100 flight-hours per 28-day cycle and 900 
flight-hours per fiscal year. For the 2012 fiscal year, the average flight-hours for Ryanair's pilots 
amounted to approximately 70 hours per month and approximately 839 hours for the complete year, a 2% 
increase on the previous fiscal year. Were more stringent regulations on flight hours to be adopted, 
Ryanair's flight personnel could experience a reduction in their total pay due to lower compensation for 
the number of hours or sectors flown and Ryanair could be required to hire additional flight personnel.
 Ryanair considers its relations with its employees to be good. Ryanair currently negotiates with groups 
of employees, including its pilots, through "Employee Representation Committees" ("ERCs") regarding pay, 
work practices and conditions of employment, including conducting formal negotiations with these internal 
collective bargaining units. Ryanair's senior management meets regularly with the different ERCs to 
discuss all aspects of the business and those issues that specifically relate to each relevant employee 
group.
 On June 19, 2009, BALPA (the U.K. pilots union) made a request for voluntary recognition under applicable 
U.K. legislation, which Ryanair rejected. BALPA had the option of applying to the U.K.'s Central 
Arbitration Committee (CAC) to organize a vote on union recognition by Ryanair's pilots in relevant 
bargaining units, as determined by the CAC but BALPA decided not to proceed with an application at that 
time. The option to apply for a ballot remains open to BALPA and if it were to seek and be successful in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC FORM 20-F/A; AMENDMENT NO. 1 -4-
such a ballot, it would be able to represent the U.K. pilots in negotiations over salaries and working 
conditions.
 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders have approved a number of share option plans for employees and directors. 
Ryanair Holdings has also issued share options to certain of its senior managers. For details of all 
outstanding share options, see "Item 10. Additional Information--Options to Purchase Securities from 
Registrant or Subsidiaries."

 --      NASDAQ requires that all members of a listed company's Nominating Committee be independent 
directors, unless the Company, as a foreign private issuer, provides an attestation of non-conforming 
practice based upon home country practice and then discloses such non-conforming practice annually in its 
Form 20-F.  As permitted by the Irish Listing Rules, Michael O'Leary, the Company's Chief Executive 
Officer, serves as a member of the Company's Nominating Committee.
 The Company also follows certain other practices under the UK Corporate Governance Code in lieu of those 
set forth in the NASDAQ corporate governance rules, as expressly permitted thereby. Most significantly:
 --      Independence. NASDAQ requires that a majority of an issuer's Board of Directors be "independent" 
under the standards set forth in the NASDAQ rules and that directors deemed independent be identified in 
the Company's annual report on Form 20-F. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the Company's 
eight non-executive directors is "independent" under the standards set forth in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, there is no bright-line test establishing set 
criteria for independence, as there is under NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15). Instead, the Board of Directors 
determines whether the director is "independent in character and judgment," and whether there are 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director's 
judgment. Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors may determine that a director is 
independent notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances which may appear relevant to 
its determination, but it should state its reasons if it makes such a determination. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code specifies that relationships or circumstances that may be relevant include whether the 
director: (i) has been an employee of the relevant company or group within the last five years; (ii) has 
had within the last three years a direct or indirect material business relationship with such company; 
(iii) has received payments from such company, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) has close family ties 
with any of the company's advisers, directors or senior employees; (v) holds cross-directorships or other 
significant links with other directors; (vi) represents a significant shareholder; or (vii) has served on 
the Board of Directors for more than nine years. In determining that each of the eight non-executive 
directors is independent under the UK Corporate Governance Code standard, the Ryanair Holdings Board of 
Directors identified such relevant factors with respect to non-executive directors Messrs. Bonderman, 
McLaughlin, Osborne, Horgan, Pietrogrande and Kirchberger. When arriving at the decision that these 
directors are nonetheless independent, the Board of Directors has taken into account the comments made by 
the Financial Reporting Council in its report dated December 2009 on its review of the impact and 
effectiveness of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The NASDAQ independence criteria specifically state 
that an individual may not be considered independent if, within the last three years, such individual or a 
Ryanair Holdings PLC FORM 20-F/A; AMENDMENT NO. 1 -3-
member of his or her immediate family has had certain specified relationships with the company, its 
parent, any consolidated subsidiary, its internal or external auditors, or any company that has 
significant business relationships with the company, its parent or any consolidated subsidiary. Neither 
ownership of a significant amount of stock nor length of service on the board is a per se bar to 
independence under the NASDAQ rules.
 --      CEO compensation. The NASDAQ rules require that an issuer's chief executive officer not be 
present during voting or deliberations by the Board of Directors on his or her compensation. There is no 
such requirement under the UK Corporate Governance Code.

each quarter. The Air Safety Committee is composed of Mr. Horgan (who acts as the chairman), as well as 
the following executive officers of Ryanair: Messrs. Conway, Hickey, O'Brien and Wilson.
 Powers of, and Action by, the Board of Directors
 The Board of Directors is empowered by the Articles to carry on the business of Ryanair Holdings, subject 
to the Articles, provisions of general law and the right of stockholders to give directions to the 
directors by way of ordinary resolutions. Every director who is present at a meeting of the Board of 
Directors of Ryanair Holdings has one vote. In the case of a tie on a vote, the chairman of the Board of 
Directors has a second or tie-breaking vote. A director may designate an alternate director to attend any 
Board of Directors meeting, and such alternate director shall have all the rights of a director at such 
meeting.
 The quorum for a meeting of the Board of Directors, unless another number is fixed by the directors, 
consists of three directors, a majority of whom must be EU nationals. The Articles require the vote of a 
majority of the directors (or alternates) present at a duly convened meeting for the approval of any 
action by the Board of Directors.
 Composition and Term of Office
 The Articles provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of no fewer than three and no more than 15 
directors, unless otherwise determined by the stockholders. There is no maximum age for a director and no 
director is required to own any shares of Ryanair Holdings.
 Directors are elected (or have their appointments confirmed) at the annual general meetings of 
stockholders. Save in certain circumstances, at every annual general meeting, one-third (rounded down to 
the next whole number if it is a fractional number) of the directors (being the directors who have been 
longest in office) must stand for re-election as their terms expire. Accordingly the terms of Michael 
Horgan, Kyran McLoughlin and Paolo Pietrogrande will have expired. Michael Horgan and Kyran McLoughlin 
will be eligible to offer themselves for re-election at the annual general meeting scheduled to be held on 
September 21, 2012. Paolo Pietrogrande will not be offering himself for re-election.
 Exemptions from NASDAQ Corporate Governance Rules
 The Company relies on certain exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance rules. These exemptions, 
and the practices the Company adheres to, are as follows:
 --      The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's quorum requirements applicable to meetings of shareholders, 
which require a minimum quorum of 33% for any meeting of the holders of common stock, which in the 
Company's case are its Ordinary Shares. In keeping with Irish generally accepted business practice, the 
Articles provide for a quorum for general meetings of shareholders of three shareholders, regardless of 
the level of their aggregate share ownership.
 --      The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's requirement with respect to audit committee approval of 
related-party transactions, as well as its requirement that shareholders approve certain stock or asset 
purchases when a director, officer or substantial shareholder has an interest. The Company is subject to 
extensive provisions under the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange (the "Irish Listing Rules") 
governing transactions with related parties, as defined therein, and the Irish Companies Act also 
restricts the extent to which Irish companies may enter into related-party transactions. In addition, the 
Articles contain provisions regarding disclosure of interests by the directors and restrictions on their 
votes in circumstances involving conflicts of interest. The concept of a related party for purposes of 
NASDAQ's audit committee and shareholder approval rules differs in certain respects from the definition of 
a transaction with a related party under the Irish Listing Rules.
Ryanair Holdings PLC FORM 20-F/A; AMENDMENT NO. 1 -2-
 --      NASDAQ requires shareholder approval for certain transactions involving the sale or issuance by a 
listed company of common stock other than in a public offering. Under the NASDAQ rules, whether 
shareholder approval is required for such transactions depends, among other things, on the number of 
shares to be issued or sold in connection with a transaction, while the Irish Listing Rules require 
shareholder approval when the size of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed 
company undertaking the transaction.
 --      NASDAQ requires that each issuer solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of 
shareholders and provide copies of such proxy solicitation to NASDAQ. The Company is exempt from this 
requirement as the solicitation of holders of ADSs is not required under the Irish Listing Rules or the 
Irish Companies Acts. Details of our annual general meetings and other shareholder meetings, together with 
the requirements for admission, voting or the appointment of a proxy are available on the website of the 
Company in accordance with the Irish Companies Acts and the Company's Articles of Association. ADS holders 
may provide instructions to The Bank of New York, as depositary, as to the voting of the underlying 
Ordinary Shares represented by such ADSs. Alternatively, ADS holders may convert their holding to Ordinary 
Shares, subject to compliance with the nationality ownership rules, in order to be eligible to attend our 
annual general meetings or other shareholder meetings.

 Manager.

European Inv Tst Plc Annual Financial Report -3-
Michael B Moule (Senior Independent Director)
EXTRACTS FROM THE DIRECTORS' REPORT
The Chairman's Statement above and the Corporate Governance Statement in the
 full Annual Report and Financial Statements form part of the Directors' Report.
The Directors present their Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements for
 the year to 30 September 2012.
BUSINESS REVIEW
Financial reporting requirements direct that the Company is required to provide
 a business review within the Directors' Report. The business review must
 contain a review of the Company's business, the principal risks and
 uncertainties it faces, an analysis of its performance during the financial
 year, the position at the year end and the future business plans of the
 Company. It must also provide information about the Company's environmental,
 social and ethical policy and about persons with whom the Company has
 contractual or other arrangements essential to the business of the Company. To
 aid understanding of these areas the Board is required to include analysis
 using appropriate Key Performance Indicators.
Forward looking statements
This business review contains "forward looking statements" with respect to the
 Company's plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its future
 financial condition, performance and results. By their nature, all forward
 looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future
 events that are beyond the Company's control. Factors that could cause actual
 results to differ materially from those estimated by the forward looking
 statements include, but are not limited to:
* Continental European economic conditions and equity market performance and
 prices.
* Changes in Continental European Government policies and monetary and interest
 rate policies.
* Changes to regulations and taxes, both in the UK and Continental Europe.
* Changes to consumer spending or saving habits and the impact of inflation and
 deflation.
* European currency exchange rates.
* The Company's success in managing its assets and business to manage the above
 factors and use of gearing.
As a result, the Company's actual future condition, performance and results may
 differ materially from the plans set out in the Company's forward looking
European Inv Tst Plc Annual Financial Report -3-
 statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the forward looking
 statements contained within this review or any other forward looking statements
 it makes.
Business and status of the Company
The principal activity of the Company is to carry on business as an investment
 trust.
The Company is registered as a public limited company and is an investment
 company within the terms of Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company
 has received approval from HM Revenue & Customs ("HMRC") as an investment trust
 under Sections 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 ("CTA") for the
 year ended 30 September 2011. This approval is subject to there being no
 subsequent enquiry under corporation tax self-assessment. The Company has been
 approved as an investment trust for all previous years. In the opinion of the
 Directors, the Company has subsequently directed its affairs so as to enable it
 to continue to qualify for such approval.
New regulations for obtaining and retaining investment trust status apply to
 the Company with effect from 1 October 2012. One of the principal changes under
 the new investment trust tax regime is to remove the restriction that no single
 investment can represent more than 15% of gross assets at the time of its
 acquisition, and to replace this with a risk diversification approach. An
 application for approval as an investment trust under the new regime must be
 made not later than 90 days after 30 September 2013. If the application is
 accepted, the Company will be treated as an investment trust company for that
 period and for each subsequent accounting period, subject to there being no
 subsequent serious breaches of the regulations.
The Company's shares have a premium listing on the Official List of the UK
 Listing Authority and are traded on the main market of the London Stock
 Exchange. The Company has a secondary listing on the New Zealand Stock
 Exchange.
The Company is a member of the AIC, a trade body intended to promote investment
 companies which also develops best practice for all its members.
A review of the Company's activities during the year is given in the Chairman's
 Statement and in the Investment Manager's Report and Portfolio Analysis.
Objective
The objective of The European Investment Trust plc is to achieve long-term
 capital growth through a diversified portfolio of Continental European
 securities.
Investment policy
European Inv Tst Plc Annual Financial Report -3-
The Board believes that investment in the diverse and increasingly accessible
 markets of this region provides opportunities for capital growth over the long
 term. At the same time it considers the structure of the Company as a UK listed
 investment trust, with fixed capital and an independent Board of Directors, to
 be well suited to investors seeking longer-term returns.
The Board recognises that investment in some European countries can be riskier
 than in others. Investment risks are diversified through holding a wide range

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 40% CUTS AT BUDAPEST
 AS HOCHTIEF FAILS TO OFFER COMPETITIVE COSTS
 10 ROUTES, 800,000 PASSENGERS & 800 JOBS LOST AT BUDAPEST AIRPORT
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, today (22 Nov) announced 40% cuts at its Budapest base 
with the closure of 10 routes and loss of over 280 weekly flights from 10 Jan 2013 after the Hochtief-run 
airport increased charges, refused to provide efficient facilities and failed to offer a competitive cost 
base for future growth offered by Ryanair.  Ryanair's Budapest traffic will fall by 800,000 pax p.a. (from 
2m to 1.2m pax) leading to the loss of up to 800 "on-site" jobs*.
 Hochtief's failure to agree a long term growth deal with Europe's largest airline is further proof that 
Budapest Airport has no interest growing Hungarian tourism, traffic and jobs as it repeatedly increases 
charges even as its traffic declines.  This was confirmed by Patrick Bohl (Budapest Airport) who recently 
admitted that 'budget airline' passengers pay more than Malev transfer passengers, with Budapest enjoying 
"probably the best recovery any airport has seen when they lost a national carrier."
 These Budapest cuts (effective 10 Jan 2013) will include:
 --     5 to 3 based aircraft
 --     30 routes to 20 (down 33%).
 --     From over 280 weekly flights to less than 170 (down 40%).
 --     2m to 1.2m pax p.a (down 40%).
 --     Frequency cuts on 9 of 20 other routes
 --     The loss of 800,000 pax p.a. and 800 "on-site" jobs at Budapest Airport.
 Ryanair regrets these cuts and confirms that they can be reversed if a competitive cost offer and 
efficient facilities become available at Budapest Airport.
 In Budapest today Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair regrets Hochtief Budapest Airport's decision to increase charges, impose inefficient facilities 
and reject our proposals for a competitive growth offer which would have allowed Ryanair to grow traffic 
and routes at Budapest.
 Ryanair will now switch 2 aircraft from Budapest with the loss of 10 routes, reductions on 9 others and 
the loss of 110 weekly flights. Sadly, 800,000 passengers p.a. and over 800 jobs will be lost by Budapest 
to other airports elsewhere in Europe, where Ryanair will continue to grow.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 40% CUTS AT BUDAPEST
 With 1.2m passengers and 20 routes, Ryanair will remain one of the 2 largest airlines operating at 
Budapest, but Hochtief cannot continue to ignore the competitive marketplace, where airports all over 
Europe have been reducing costs and offering efficient facilities in return for traffic growth.  We hope 
there is a way to reverse these cuts to ensure further Ryanair growth at Budapest."

 RYANAIR UPDATE ON AER LINGUS OFFER
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, confirmed today (14 Nov) that its discussions continue with the 
European Commission about its radical package of remedies designed to address the Commission's competition 
concerns in relation to Ryanair's 19 June offer for Aer Lingus.  This comprehensive remedies package includes a 
number of new airline bases in Dublin, new entrant competitors on over 40 routes to/from Dublin, Cork and 
Shannon, as well as specific competition solutions that guarantee increased price competition on routes to and from 
Ireland.  Following receipt of the Commission's statement of objections last evening (13 Nov), a standard 
procedural step in Phase II EU merger reviews, Ryanair expects that the Commission will shortly market test this 
transformational remedies package, and remains confident that its offer for Aer Lingus will receive competition 
clearance following any fair assessment by the Commission.  A detailed process of engagement with the EU 
Commission is now underway.
 Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus is being reviewed while dramatic changes take place across the EU airline industry, 
including: (1) a large restructuring of Iberia with 4,500 job losses; (2) the takeover of Vueling by IAG, combining the 
No 2 and No 3 airlines in Spain; (3) a major restructuring of SAS including 6,000 job losses and state backed loan 
guarantees; and (4) the planned merger of Aegean and Olympic, the No 1 and No 2 airlines in Greece.  It is against 
this backdrop that Ryanair is proposing a merger that provides secure jobs, growth opportunities and financial 
benefits for all shareholders in a larger Ireland based EU carrier.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES PROPOSED IAG -VUELING MERGER
 MIRRORS EARLIER BA/BMI & CURRENT RYANAIR/AER LINGUS OFFER
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra low fares airline, today (12 Nov) welcomed the announcement by IAG/Iberia 
that it intends to acquire Vueling, as the consolidation of Europe's airlines continues.
 This latest airline merger mirrors the EU Commission's Phase 1 approved merger of IAG/British Airways 
with British Midland (in the UK) in March 2012, Aegean's recent takeover offer for Olympic in Greece and 
Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus, which is currently being reviewed by the EU Competition Authorities.
 IAG's announcement that it is to cut 4,500 jobs at Iberia further demonstrates the changing landscape of 
Europe's aviation industry and the need for continuing restructuring and reform among Europe's high fares 
former flag carriers who, like Aer Lingus, cannot survive as independent airlines.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "The merger of IAG Iberia and Vueling is another logical merger of EU airlines operating in the same 
market and mirrors IAG/British Airways takeover of BMI in the UK earlier this year, Aegean's offer for 
Olympic in Greece and Ryanair's current offer for Aer Lingus in Ireland.
 As Europe's flag carrier airlines continue to consolidate Ryanair believes that its offer for Aer Lingus 
should be approved by the EU Competition Authorities if they follow - fairly - the precedent set in the 
BA/BMI merger and last weeks takeover of Vueling in Spain by BA/IAG.  These are all inevitable steps in 
the consolidation process of Europe's high fares former flag carrier airlines."

 RYANAIR STRONG 1/2 YEAR - PROFIT UP 10% TO EUR596M
 TRAFFIC GROWS 7% - FULL YEAR GUIDANCE RAISED.
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline today (Nov 5) announced strong H1 profits up 10% to EUR596m as 
revenues increased 15% to EUR3.11bn, traffic grew 7% to 48m passengers, while ave. fares rose 6%.  Unit costs 
were up 8% mainly due to a 24% (EUR218m) increase in fuel.  Excluding fuel adjusted unit costs rose by 2%.

Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
 "The highlights of the half year include;
 --    Profits up 10% to EUR596m.
 --    Traffic grew 7% to 48m, a six month record.
 --    The fleet grew to 298 Boeing 737-800s, an all time high.
 --    2 new bases Paphos (Cyprus) & Maastricht (Holland) were announced.
 --    158 new routes launched (now operating over 1,500 daily flights).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
 --    A one-off dividend of EUR489m was approved, payable on November 30.
 --    Gross cash exceeds EUR3.9bn, an all-time record.
 Our 10% profit increase in H1 combined with traffic growth of 7% during a period of high oil prices and 
continuing recession\austerity in Europe was another robust result. Profits exceeded our expectations 
driven by a combination of strong summer bookings, particularly post the Olympics, a 6% rise in ave. 
fares, and lower than forecast fuel bill due to the successful implementation of our fuel savings 
programme.  Our fuel costs rose by EUR218m (+24%) as oil costs increased 18% from pbl$83 to pbl$98. 
Excluding fuel, unit costs rose 2% during the summer period due to tight cost control despite excessive 
increases in Italian ATC costs and airport charges in Spain.  Ancillary revenue rose by 12% to approx. 
EUR12 per pax.
 EU short-haul market
 The combination of higher oil prices and EU wide recession continues to drive significant change in 
European aviation.  A number of EU airlines have closed this summer including Windjet (Sicily), OLT 
Express (Poland), and bmibaby (UK). These follow earlier collapses of both Malev (Hungary) and Spanair 
(Spain) in 2012.  Legacy carriers including AF\KLM, IAG, Lufthansa, SAS, and Air Berlin have all announced 
restructurings that include significant contraction of their short-haul operations. Charter airlines such 
as Thomas Cook are also cutting fleet sizes.  In contrast Ryanair continues to find profitable 
opportunities for growth across Europe as higher cost and less efficient competitors struggle to survive. 
Our new bases in Budapest and Warsaw have stimulated strong demand at Ryanair's very low fares while 
expansion of existing bases in Spain, the UK and Germany has delivered impressive volume and profit 
growth.
 We expect market conditions in Europe to remain tough as recession, austerity, high fuel costs, and 
excessive Government taxes dampen air travel demand. Further airline failures and consolidations are 
inevitable given the fragmentation among European airlines and the existence of so many high cost, high 
fare airlines with poor punctuality records. In this environment Ryanair sees substantial opportunities to 
grow by deploying our industry leading low costs, low fares and on-time flights with our youngest, largest 
and safest fleet of Boeing 737s in Europe.
 Growth opportunity
 Ryanair carried 48m passengers during H1 (79m on a 12m rolling basis), and now accounts for approx. 12% 
of Europe's short-haul air travel market. Analysis of that market shows an industry dominated by loss-
making, unreliable and inefficient airlines producing substantial revenues but unsustainable aggregate 
losses.  Ryanair estimates about 580m short-haul passengers are travelling at substantially higher fares 
with intra EU airlines that are either loss-making or producing meagre profit margins. This represents a 
major opportunity for Ryanair's lowest fares model- given our substantial unit cost advantage -to grow 
profitably to 120m passengers per annum over the next 10 years.
 Regulatory obstacles to growth
 European Governments and the EU Commission are limiting the potential for air travel to stimulate 
economic activity. Regressive air passenger taxes (UK & Germany), excessive airport charge increases 
(Spain, Italy and Ireland), a discredited EU emissions tax scheme and regulatory resistance to regional 
airport expansion are all symptoms of an anti-consumer and anti-aviation bias in policymaking. Aside from 
inhibiting economic growth, Europe's bureaucratic tendency towards re-regulation is giving Gulf and Asian 
carrier's in particular a competitive advantage over EU based airlines. A more expansive series of policy 
changes, to include cuts in air taxes, a suspension of the discredited ETS scheme and other regulatory 
failures, and the promotion of competition from underutilised regional airport capacity across Europe is 
urgently needed to stimulate tourism, jobs, and economic growth. Ryanair continues to campaign in favour 
of pro-growth, pro-consumer, lower fare policies across the EU airline sector.
 Aer Lingus Update.
 Under Irish Takeover Panel rules we are unable in these results to update on our offer to acquire Aer 
Lingus. Accordingly we are issuing a separate announcement on this matter today.
 Stansted Airport Sale.
 Ryanair withdrew from the sale process for Stansted in October after we were (remarkably) excluded from 
the transaction by the airport's owner Ferrovial. The exclusion of Stansted's largest customer from this 
"customer focussed" sale process again highlights the abject failure of both the CAA and the UK 
Competition Commission to defend the interests of customers from monopoly abuse by Ferrovial\BAA. Ryanair 
believes significant traffic growth is possible at Stansted but only if the doubling of prices which 
occurred in 2007 (which directly led to a 25% traffic decline) is reversed. Ryanair is strongly opposed to 
Stansted's unjustly inflated RAB and encourages all bidders to forensically examine the true asset base 
(which Ryanair estimates at GBP640m) before making any bid for these inflated assets. The optimal future 
for Stansted is to increase passenger volume through a mixture of disciplined capex and highly competitive 
(i.e. reduced) charges that encourage sustainable long-term traffic growth. Ryanair will support any such 
growth plan. However, if the new owners of Stansted do not immediately and significantly cut the BAA's 
high and uncompetitive charges, then it is inevitable that traffic at Stansted will continue to decline as 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
it has for 6 years in a row under the BAA's mismanagement and the CAA's failed regulatory regime, which 
even the UK Competition Commission has admitted is "inadequate".
 Ryanair strengths
 Ryanair ex fuel passenger cost of EUR26 during H1 is the lowest of any carrier in Europe.  Our average 
fare of EUR53 is (by some distance) the lowest price available to EU consumers.  Through disciplined 
management of costs, and by operating a modern, fuel efficient fleet, Ryanair can not only maintain but 
can further expand its cost advantage over all other competitors across Europe.  The combination of 
Ryanair's industry leading cost base, high cash flows and strong balance sheet, gives Ryanair the platform 
to embark upon its next decade of growth. Ryanair believes it is legitimate to target an 18% + share of 
the EU short-haul market and in the process grow its traffic by up to 50% to approx. 120m per annum over 
the next decade.
 Balance Sheet and hedging.
 Ryanair's balance sheet is among the strongest in the global airline industry. Bloomberg recently 
described Ryanair as "the world's least indebted airline". At the end of H1 Ryanair had gross cash of 
EUR3.9bn, up EUR417m since March while free cash flow in the period was EUR610m. The financial strength of 
the business is evidenced by our recent aircraft bond issue which carried an interest cost of just under 
1.7%.  Ryanair has availed of historically low interest rates to secure almost 70% of our fleet financing 
at an all-in rate of just over 3%.
 We have recently extended our FY 14 fuel hedges to almost 50% of FY 14 at pbl$97 and hedged our Q1 FY14 
EUR/$ exchange rate on our fuel exposures at 1.30. This implies our euro fuel costs per passenger in 
summer '13 at current rates will rise by approx. 5%, compared to 9% in summer '12.
 2(nd) Special dividend and shareholder returns.
 A 2(nd) special dividend of EUR489m (EUR0.34 per share) was approved at our September AGM and will be 
paid to shareholders on November 30.  Ryanair has returned EUR1.53bn (via dividends and share buybacks) to 
shareholders over the past 5 years, and this compares with a total equity raised of just EUR585m since 
Ryanair joined the stock market in 1997. Over that period we have grown passenger volume from 3m to 79m 
p.a. while the fleet has expanded from 12 to 298 aircraft, and our balance sheet is in a strong net cash 
position.
 Outlook.

 Our Q2 yield and fuel cost performance was better than we originally anticipated which has boosted our 
profitability.  We are on target to grow traffic in FY13 by 4% to over 79m passengers.  H2 traffic will be 
broadly flat as we ground up to 80 aircraft to limit the impact of high oil prices, high airport fees at 
Stansted and Dublin, and seasonally weaker demand and yields upon the business.  We remain cautious about 
winter trading as we have little visibility on Q4 bookings or yields. Recession, competition and very low 
fare competition at new bases will constrain profitability during H2, although we now expect full year 
yields to rise by up to 4%. Notwithstanding these concerns, and given our H1 performance we feel it would 
be appropriate to raise our FY profit guidance from its previous range of EUR400m to EUR440m to a new 
range of EUR490m to EUR520m.

many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and 
Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.
 Ryanair is the World's favourite airline and operates more than 1,500 flights per day from 51 bases and 1,500 low

 Independent review report of KPMG to Ryanair Holdings plc
 Introduction
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -8-
 We have been engaged by Ryanair Holdings plc ("the Company") to review the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2012, which comprise the condensed 
consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the condensed 
consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed consolidated interim statement of 
cash flows, the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in shareholders' equity and the 
related notes.  We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and 
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information 
in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
 This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the 
Company in meeting the requirements of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the 
Transparency Rules of the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules of the UK's Financial Services Authority ("the FSA").  Our review has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other 
purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The half-yearly financial report, including the condensed consolidated interim financial statements 
contained therein, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.  The directors are 
responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) 
Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK FSA.
 As disclosed in note 1 - basis of preparation, the annual consolidated financial statements of the 
Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union ('EU').  The condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report have been prepared 
in accordance with IAS 34, "Interim Financial Reporting," as adopted by the EU.
 Our responsibility
 Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements in the half-yearly financial report, based on our review.
 Scope of review
 We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 
2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board.  A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
 Conclusion
 Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 
September 30, 2012 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the 
EU, the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Republic 
of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK FSA.

 Finance expense decreased by 4% to EUR52.8m primarily due to lower interest rates in the year compared to 
the half-year ended September 30, 2011.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR417.1m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,932.7m and Gross debt increased by 
EUR58.0m to EUR3,683.2m.  As a result we have moved from Net debt of EUR109.6m at March 31, 2012 to Net 
cash of EUR249.5m at September 30, 2012. The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR607.4m 
which funded net capital expenditure of EUR179.1m, debt repayments and a EUR67.5m share buy-back 
programme.
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR442.8m in the half-year to EUR3,749.5m due to the net profit after 
tax of EUR595.6m offset by share buy-backs and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives, 
available for sale financial assets and employee share options.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended September 30, 2012
 Profit after tax increased by 23% to EUR496.8m primarily due to a 7% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenues offset by a 21% rise in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 17% to 
EUR1,822.2m primarily due to a 7% increase in average fares, and an 8% rise in passenger numbers.  Fuel, 
which represents 47% of total operating costs compared to 45% in the prior year, increased by 21% to 
EUR581.2m due to a higher price per gallon paid and a 7% increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit 
costs excluding fuel rose by 2%, including fuel unit costs rose by 6%.  Operating margin, as a result of 
the above, increased by 1 point to 32% whilst operating profit rose by 21% to EUR580.7m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 17% to EUR1,822.2m primarily due to a 7% increase in average fares 
which was partially impacted by the strength of sterling to the euro, an 8% increase in passenger numbers 
to 25.5m and strong ancillary revenues.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 8%, primarily due to a 7% increase in average fare and strong growth 
in ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 16% to EUR1,524.3m due to an 8% rise in passengers and a 7% 
increase in average fares, and was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro.  Load 
factor remained flat at 87%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 25% to EUR297.9m, faster than the 8% increase in passenger volume, due to 
a combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating and higher internet related 
revenues.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -6-
 Total operating expenses increased by 15% to EUR1,241.5m due to the 21% rise in fuel costs, increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline and the negative impact of the strength of sterling to the 
euro.
 Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR124.1m due to a 7% increase in flight hours and a 2% pay increase for 
flight crew granted in April 2012.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 9% to EUR85.1m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and a higher number of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this quarter (September 30, 2012: 243) 
compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2011 (221).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 21% to EUR581.2m due to higher fuel prices and the increased number of 
hours flown.
 Maintenance costs increased by 16% to EUR30.0m, due to the higher level of activity, line maintenance 
costs arising from the launch of new bases, and handback provisions for leased aircraft.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 7% to EUR23.3m, due to a net increase in the number of average leased 
aircraft from 53 to 55, and the negative impact of higher lessor financing costs for 8 new leased 
aircraft.  We handed back 4 aircraft in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 due to the maturity of leases.
 Route charges rose by 7% to EUR147.7m due to the increased number of sectors flown, offset by a slightly 
shorter sector length.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 14% to EUR186.7m, due to the 9% increase in sectors flown, 
increased charges in Spain, a quadrupling of ATC charges in Italy, the mix of new routes and bases 
launched and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs increased by EUR10.7m to EUR63.5m, reflecting higher marketing 
spend per passenger due to the launch of an additional 6 new bases and new routes compared to the quarter 
ended September 30, 2011.  Ancillary costs rose due to the increased level of sales.
 Operating margin increased by 1 point due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
increased by 21% to EUR580.7m.
 Finance income decreased by 3% to EUR11.8m primarily due to the decline in interest rates, particularly 
for deposits placed with highly rated financial institutions, which resulted in lower yields.
 Finance expense is down by 5% to EUR26.4m primarily due to lower interest rates in the quarter compared 
to the quarter ended September 30, 2011.

 RYANAIR UPDATE ON AER LINGUS
 Further to Ryanair's H1 results announcement issued today (Nov 5), the following is an update in relation 
to the Aer Lingus offer:
 Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary Said:
 "Consolidation is an essential part of making EU airlines more competitive.  It has already taken place 
in core EU countries via IAG (Iberia and BMI merger), AF\KLM (including their investment in Alitalia) and 
Lufthansa (via takeovers of Austrian, Brussels Airlines and Swiss).  That process is now spreading to 
peripheral countries as Aegean merges with Olympic in Greece, TAP is sold in Portugal and Ryanair bids 
again for Aer Lingus.
 As part of the EU's Phase 2 review which began on August 29, Ryanair has submitted an unprecedented 
remedies package, under which multiple up-front buyers will commit to open new bases in Ireland, and enter 
all of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus crossover routes which are not currently served by other substantial airline 
competitors.  We believe this is the first EU airline merger where the remedies proposed delivers not one, 
but at least two up-front buyer remedies, and where all of the "merger to monopoly routes" are remedied 
not just by passive slot divestments but by active up-front buyers and new market entrants.
 Ryanair is determined to explore all commercial options to address any competition concerns the EU may 
have in order to secure approval for its proposed merger.  The recent BA/BMI (Phase 1) merger approval and 
the subsequent Aegean/Olympic merger proposal vindicate Ryanair's view that its offer for Aer Lingus along 
with the radical remedies package will - if fairly assessed - secure EU competition approval."

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Summary half-year ended September 30, 2012
 Profit after tax increased by 10% to EUR595.6m compared to EUR543.5m in the half-year ended September 30, 
2011 primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by a 24% increase in fuel 
costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR3,106.1m as average fares rose by 6%.  Ancillary 
revenues grew by 20%, faster than the 7% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR583.8m due to a combination of 
an improved product mix and the roll out of reserved seating across the network.  Total revenue per passenger, as 
a result, increased by 7% whilst Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 84% during the period compared to the period 
ended September 30, 2011.
 Total operating expenses increased by 16% to EUR2,393.4m, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, the higher 
level of activity, the strength of sterling to the euro and operating costs associated with the growth of the airline.  
Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs compared to 44% in the comparative period, increased by 24% 
to EUR1,124.9m due to the higher price per gallon paid and a 6% increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit costs 
excluding fuel increased by 2%, including fuel unit costs rose by 8%.  Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 
23% whilst operating profit increased by 10% to EUR712.7m.
 Net margin was down 1 point to 19%, compared to September 30, 2011.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 41.34 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 36.62 euro 
cent at September 30, 2011.
 Balance sheet
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 Gross cash increased by EUR417.1m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,932.7m and Gross debt increased by 
EUR58.0m to EUR3,683.2m.  As a result we have moved from Net debt of EUR109.6m at March 31, 2012 to Net 
cash of EUR249.5m at September 30, 2012. The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR607.4m 
which funded net capital expenditure of EUR179.1m, debt repayments, and a EUR67.5m share buy-back 
programme.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the half-year ended September 30, 2012
 Profit after tax increased by 10% to EUR595.6m primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenues offset by a 24% rise in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR3,106.1m 
primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares, a 7% rise in passenger numbers and strong ancillary revenue. 
Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs, compared to 44% in the prior year, increased by 24% to 
EUR1,124.9m due to a higher price per gallon paid and a 6% increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit costs 
excluding fuel rose by 2%, including fuel unit costs rose by 8%.  Operating margin, as a result of the above, 
decreased by 1 point to 23% whilst operating profit increased by 10% to EUR712.7m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR3,106.1m primarily due to a 6% rise in average fares which was 
partially impacted by the strength of sterling to the euro, a 7% increase in passenger numbers to 48.0m and strong 
ancillary revenues.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 7%, primarily due to a 6% increase in average fare and strong growth in 
ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 13% to EUR2,522.3m due to a 7% increase in passengers and a 6% 
rise in average fares, and was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro.  Load factor decreased by 1 
point to 84%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 20% to EUR583.8m, faster than the 7% increase in passenger volume, due to a 
combination of an improved product mix, the network roll out of reserved seating, and higher internet related 
revenues.
 Total operating expenses increased by 16% to EUR2,393.4m due to the 24% rise in fuel costs, increased costs 
associated with the growth of the airline, and the negative impact of the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR240.0m due to a 6% increase in flight hours and a 2% pay increase for flight 
crew granted in April 2012.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 9% to EUR169.9m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and a higher number of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this period (September 30, 2012: 243) compared to the 
half-year ended September 30, 2011 (221).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 24% to EUR1,124.9m due to higher fuel prices and the increased number of hours 
flown.
 Maintenance costs increased by 17% to EUR57.7m, due to the higher level of activity, line maintenance costs 
arising from the launch of new bases, and handback provisions for leased aircraft.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 9% to EUR47.6m, due to a net increase in the number of average leased aircraft 
in the fleet from 52 to 55 and the negative impact of higher lessor financing costs for 8 new leased aircraft.  We 
handed back 4 aircraft in the half-year due to the maturity of leases.
 Route charges rose by 5% to EUR285.2m due to the increased number of sectors flown, offset by a slightly shorter 
sector length.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 12% to EUR353.0m, due to the 8% increase in sectors flown, increased 
charges in Spain, a quadrupling of ATC charges in Italy, the mix of new routes and bases launched, and the 
strength of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs increased by EUR19.1m to EUR115.1m, reflecting higher marketing spend per 
passenger due to the launch of 6 new bases and new routes compared to the period ending September 30, 2011. 
Ancillary costs rose due to the increased level of sales.
 Operating margin decreased by 1 point due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have increased by 
10% to EUR712.7m.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 Finance income decreased by 11% to EUR19.5m primarily due to the decline in interest rates, particularly for 
deposits placed with highly rated financial institutions, which resulted in lower yields.

 2. Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3. Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -7-
 4. Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the half-year ended September 
30, 2012 was 12.3% (September 30, 2011: 12.3%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2012 
of EUR83.7m (September 30, 2011: EUR76.1m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary 
differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement and the utilisation of 
previous trading losses.
 5. Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.0m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6. Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7. Capital commitments
 At September 30, 2012 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 298 (2011: 277) Boeing 737-800 aircraft and had 
firm orders for an additional 7 Boeing 737-800's.  The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase 
the fleet size (net of lease hand-backs) to 305 aircraft by March 31, 2013.
 8. Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR149.7m at March 31, 2012 to EUR164.5m at 
September 30, 2012 is comprised of a gain of EUR14.8m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012 to EUR1.03 
per share at September 30, 2012.  On August 29, 2012 the EU Competition Commission announced that the 
proposed merger would enter a phase 2 review.
 9. Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties.  The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.

options assumed to be converted of 5.0m (2011: 2.5m).
 11. Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the half-year amounted to EUR179.1m and is primarily aircraft.
 12. Share buy-back
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0m ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5m.  This trade 
settled in early April 2012.  This is equivalent to approximately 1.0% of the Company's issued share capital. All 
ordinary shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 15.0m ordinary shares 
with a nominal value of EUR0.1m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.1m. The 
capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent 
Company.
 13. Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. All 
transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the half-year ended September 30, 2012 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the related 
party transactions described in the 2012 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the financial position or 
performance of the Company in the same period.

 RYANAIR CALLS ON AER LINGUS DIRECTOR (ICTU FAT CAT) DAVID BEGG TO CONDEMN STRIKES OR RESIGN
 OFFERS AER LINGUS FULLY CREWED AIRCRAFT FOR 19(th) NOV PENSION STRIKE
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (30 Oct) reiterated its offer to provide Aer Lingus with as

disruptions during threatened strike action on Monday 19(th) Nov next.
 Ryanair supports the Aer Lingus position that no additional contributions should be made to its defined 
contribution (DC) pension schemes and called on Aer Lingus Director (and ICTU fat cat boss) David Begg to 
confirm his support for Aer Lingus' position or resign from the Board.
 These staff pension schemes were already topped up with EUR104m of shareholder funds at the time of Aer 
Lingus' 2006 IPO, and both the unions and employees agreed at that time that the airline's pension 
contributions would be fixed thereafter.  In addition Aer Lingus employees received 15% of the equity at 
the IPO as well as a further EUR35m gift from the airline in 2010 to pay off the ESOT's bank debts.  Aer 
Lingus' 2011 annual report confirms that its EUR20m payment to its DC pension scheme is more than half of 
Aer Lingus' annual profit.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "Ryanair will provide assistance to Aer Lingus to maintain it flight schedules without disruption in the 
face of unjustified strikes by Aer Lingus unions who are yet again seeking to unjustly enrich themselves 
at the expense of Aer Lingus' shareholders.
 "Ryanair calls on Aer Lingus Director (and ICTU fat cat boss) David Begg to confirm that he supports the 
Aer Lingus position on these defined contribution pension schemes and condemns this industrial blackmail 
by these Aer Lingus unions, or he must resign to step down from the Aer Lingus Board."

 RYANAIR OFFERS AER LINGUS FULLY CREWED AIRCRAFT TO PREVENT PENSION STRIKE DISRUPTION
 RYANAIR SUPPORTS AER LINGUS POLICY OF NO FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION SCHEMES
 Ryanair calls on Aer Lingus Director (and ICTU fat cat boss) David Begg to confirm that he supports Aer 
Lingus, and condemns these unacceptable strike threats
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 airline, today (29 Oct) announced that it had written to Aer Lingus supporting 
the airline's policy that it should not make any additional contributions to its defined contribution 
pension schemes.  Ryanair noted that these pension schemes were already topped up with EUR104m of 
shareholder funds at the time of Aer Lingus' 2006 IPO, and both the unions and employees agreed at that 
time that the airline's pension contributions would be fixed thereafter.
 Ryanair regards this latest attempt by Aer Lingus unions to bully the airline into making further 
unjustified contributions to Aer Lingus' defined contribution pension schemes as industrial blackmail.  
These claims are totally unjustified coming from a group of unions which already received a gift of 
EUR104m into their pension schemes in 2006, on top of receiving 15% of Aer Lingus' equity at the IPO and a 
further EUR35m gift from the airline in 2010 to pay off the ESOT's bank debts.
 Ryanair believes that the shareholders of Aer Lingus have had enough of these repeated cash raids by the 
Aer Lingus unions.  Aer Lingus' pension schemes are clearly defined contribution, and there is no 
justification for any further or additional contributions being made by Aer Lingus.  Should the Aer Lingus 
unions again attempt to blackmail the airline using threats of industrial action, then Ryanair will 
provide Aer Lingus with as many short-haul aircraft at market rates as the airline needs to enable it to 
continue to fly without disruptions to Aer Lingus passengers, while defending the funds of Aer Lingus 
shareholders.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "Ryanair has written today to Aer Lingus CEO Christoph Mueller supporting the company's "no further 
contribution" policy towards Aer Lingus' defined contribution pension schemes.  In its 2011 annual report, 
Aer Lingus contributed some EUR20m to its DC pension schemes, which equated to more than half of Aer 
Lingus' total profitability.  Enough is enough.  Ryanair will provide every assistance to Aer Lingus to 
maintain competition with Ryanair, and defeat these threats of disruption to Aer Lingus schedules by Aer 
Lingus unions who are yet again seeking to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of Aer Lingus' 
shareholders.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Offers Aer Lingus Fully Crewed Aircraft
 "Ryanair also calls on the DAA to dismiss any further attempt by its unions to featherbed their pension 
schemes, when any such cost increase will inevitably be passed on, by Ireland's inadequate Aviation 
Regulator, to passengers in the form of higher airport charges.  As traffic at Ireland's DAA airports 
continues to decline, this country and our tourism industry cannot afford higher airport charges, or more 
strike threats from these out of touch airport trade unions.
 "Ryanair is willing to provide whatever aircraft Aer Lingus needs to enable them to avoid disruptions to 
Aer Lingus' flights or services should the Aer Lingus unions engage in any industrial relations blackmail 
over these unjustified pension claims.
 "Ryanair also calls on Aer Lingus Director (and ICTU fat cat boss) David Begg to confirm that he supports 
the airlines position on these defined contribution pension schemes and that he condemn this industrial 
blackmail by these Aer Lingus unions.

 FastJet Plc
 ("FastJet" or the "Company")
 FastJet Expands Fleet; Further Strengthens Management Team
 FastJet Plc, Africa's first pan African low cost airline, announces today it has expanded its aircraft fleet, signed a 
maintenance contract with a leading aircraft maintenance company and further strengthened its management team 
ahead of the airline's planned launch next month.
 FastJet has signed operating lease agreements with Volito Aviation for two Airbus A319s and will take delivery of 
the aircraft in November. These are the second and third Airbus A319s the Company has leased and it remains on 
track to meet its target of deploying five Airbus A319s in Africa within six months of launch and up to 15 aircraft in a 
years' time.
 The airline has also appointed three senior aviation executives to the Company's management team. Taking up 
their roles today, Rob Bishton, Kyle Haywood and Harun Cordan will combine their wealth of industry experience 
with that of the existing FastJet team.
 Commenting on the aircraft leases and recent management hires, FastJet Chief Executive Ed Winter said:
 "Signing two further aircraft to our fleet and securing delivery in November puts us firmly on track to launch FastJet 
next month at our first base in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. I am also delighted to be welcoming three top aviation 
executives to the FastJet team. Between them they bring over 50 years of operational experience from across the 
sector and they are important strategic hires for us ahead of launch and our inaugural flight in just a few weeks."

 Rob Bishton joins FastJet as Operations Director, based at the airline's headquarters in Gatwick, London.  Rob 
previously worked for easyJet where he spent two years as Chief Pilot and Head of Aircraft Operations.  Prior to 
joining easyJet, Rob was Director of Flight Operations at Astraeus Ltd.
 Kyle Haywood, former Chief Executive of Air Uganda, joins FastJet as General Manager of Africa.  Having worked 
in the airline industry for over 25 years, Kyle has previously held senior positions at Air Arabia, Gulf Air and British 
Airways.
 Former Ryanair executive Harun Cordan assumes the role of Group Chief Pilot and Head of Flight Operations. 
Prior to joining FastJet, Harun held a number of positions at the Irish low cost carrier, including Chief Instructor and 
Deputy Head of Training.
 FastJet also announces that it has entered into an exclusive service contract with Swissport International Ltd under 
which Swissport will provide ground handling and related management services to FastJet across its operations.  
Swissport provides ground services at 195 airports in 38 countries on five continents, and was named Global 
Aviation Ground Services company 2012.
 Following a competitive tender process, FastJet has also awarded a five year contract to Sabena technics to 
provide maintenance support for the airline's fleet of Airbus A319s.
 Sabena technics, a leading independent provider of aircraft maintenance services, will provide FastJet with 
engineering services and comprehensive material support for components and consumables. It will also establish 
local operations at FastJet's first base in Dar es Salaam, to provide line and light maintenance services.
 Commenting on the decision to award FastJet's aircraft maintenance services contract to Sabena technics, Ed 
Winter said:
 "We are delighted to welcome Sabena technics on board at this exciting time in FastJet's development.  We are 
now closer than ever to our goal of bringing a high-quality, reliable, affordable service to the people of Africa and 
today's agreement with a leading European Maintenance Repair Overhaul (MRO) company reaffirms our 
commitment to establishing FastJet as an airline operating to international standards."
 Rodolphe Marchais, Chairman & CEO of Sabena technics added:
 "We are very proud that FastJet has selected us to assist it in the launch and development of its operations, 
Sabena technics' experience and know-how in full support solutions means that FastJet can depend on us to 
deliver a reliable service from the start. We look forward to supporting FastJet's future expansion into other African 
countries and thereby grow our maintenance service portfolio with other customers in the region."

 RYANAIR WITHDRAWS FROM STANSTED SALE PROCESS, AS FERROVIAL REFUSES TO ENGAGE WITH RYANAIR
 Ryanair, Stansted's largest airline (with almost 70% of Stansted's traffic), today (9 Oct) announced that 
it had withdrawn from the Stansted sale process, having been advised by BAA Stansted's owner, Ferrovial, 
that it will exclude Ryanair (and any Ryanair related consortium) from the Stansted sale process.
 Since Ryanair does not wish to prejudice other potential investors in Stansted, it has written to all 
investors/consortia it has held discussions with to advise them that Ryanair will not participate in the 
sale process or seek a minority stake.
 Ryanair will continue to explore the rapid traffic growth opportunities it believes are available at 
Stansted, if and when the new owner of Stansted reverses the doubling of prices which the BAA/Ferrovial 
monopoly imposed on Stansted's airlines and passengers in 2007, which has resulted in a 25% traffic 
decline at Stansted from 23.8m pax in 2007, to just 18m pax in 2011.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "We regret Ferrovial's decision to exclude Ryanair from the Stansted sale process and the failure of the 
Competition Commission to restrain this anti-competitive and anti-customer behaviour by Ferrovial.
 While we fully accept that Ferrovial is entirely free not to sell to Ryanair, we fail to understand how 
it can comply with competition law if Stansted's biggest customer, accounting for 70% of the traffic, is 
excluded from this sale process.
 This year's continuing traffic decline underlines the extraordinary damage done to Stansted airlines and 
passengers by the Ferrovial/BAA airport monopoly and we look forward to discussing cost reductions and 
traffic growth with the new owners of Stansted when it is finally sold.
 The only way Stansted's traffic decline can be reversed is if its uncompetitive charges are significantly 
reduced, initially by reversing the disastrous 100% price increase imposed by the BAA monopoly at Stansted 
in 2007."
