An air traffic controllers' strike in France led to cancellations and delays on Monday, and also affected flights 
travelling from other countries through French airspace.
Ahead of the industrial action, the Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) had asked Paris-Orly and Toulouse airports to 
reduce the number of flights by 25%. In Bordeaux and Marseille, 20% of flights were to be cancelled.
Other airports and airlines flying over France, on their way from Germany to Spain, for example, were also affected.
The airline Ryanair called on the EU to protect overflight rights and the freedom of movement of EU citizens during 
the air traffic controllers' strike.
This year, air traffic has already been disrupted on 65 days during strikes by French air traffic controllers, leading to 
the cancellation of thousands of flights from Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland and the UK.
France had prioritized flights within France during emergency operations during the strikes, which budget airline 
Ryanair described as unfair.
The current strike by French air traffic controllers was directed against a government decision that obliges air traffic 
controllers to give 48 hours notice of whether or not they will take part in a strike.
This is intended to make restrictions in air traffic more predictable and allow time for measures to mitigate them.

Budget airline Ryanair is reducing its autumn and winter schedule due to problems in the delivery of Boeing aircraft.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said, "At this early date, we do not expect these delivery delays will materially affect 
our full year traffic target of 183.5m, but if the delays worsen or extend further into the Jan to Mar 2024 period, we 
may have to revisit this figure and possibly adjust it slightly downward."
Ryanair now expects to receive only 14 aircraft between October and December, while earlier it was expecting 
deliveries of 27 aircraft between September and December.
According to the company, the expected reduction in deliveries was due to production delays at the Spirit Fuselage 
facility in Wichita, combined with Boeings repair and delivery delays in Seattle.
Ryanair will make a number of adjustments to its winter 2023 schedule this week. The company is reducing the 
number of Charleroi based aircraft by three, Dublin based aircraft by two, and will reduce five aircraft across four 
Italian bases, including Bergamo, Naples and Pisa.
There will also be aircraft reductions in East Midlands, Porto, and Cologne. These flight cancellations will take effect 
from the end of October.
Passengers will be offered seats on alternative flights or full refunds as they so wish. Ryanair said it is working with 
Boeing to try to get delivery of all 57 contracted B737 aircraft before the end of May 2024.
The company hopes to enter the summer 2024 peak travel season with all 57 new Boeing aircraft deliveries as 
expected.
The company noted that it has no spare aircraft this winter as scheduled maintenance is necessary across full fleet 
of over 550 aircraft to prepare for summer 2024 schedule.

Meloni pushes EU to give thumbs up to Lufthansa-ITA airline deal
Meloni pushes EU to give thumbs up to Lufthansa-ITA airline deal

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is putting pressure on the European Commission to back an agreement where 
German airline Lufthansa would take over a minority stake in the Italian airline ITA.
"It is strange that the European Commission is blocking the solution to the ITA problem," Meloni said on Sunday 
after the G20 summit wrapped up in New Delhi.
Lufthansa is to take over a 41% stake in ITA, which was formed in 2020 after a restructuring of the failed carrier 
Alitalia, for an initial investment of (EURO)325 million ($348 million).
The Italian government took control of the airline in March 2020 when various takeover bids failed.
After months of negotiations, the German MDax-listed Lufthansa Group and Rome announced the deal at the end 
of April.
The European Commission must still approve the agreement.
The decision is the responsibility of the EU Economy Commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni.
Gentiloni, a social democrat and former Italian prime minister, belongs to a rival political party to Meloni's far-right 
party Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy).
The deal is subject to competition law reviews at both a national and European level.
EU competition authorities are expected to pay particular attention to whether a monopoly situation is created at the 
airports in Rome and Milan.
Meloni pushes EU to give thumbs up to Lufthansa-ITA airline deal
At present, the Lufthansa Group only attracts transfer passengers from wealthier northern Italy to the Munich hub 
with flights operated by Air Dolomiti.
Now, with ITA, Lufthansa is acquiring a market share in an environment dominated by non-domestic low-cost 
carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG has already taken over the former state-owned airlines of neighbouring Switzerland, 
Austria and Belgium and has continued to operate them as independent brands.
The Belgian Sabena successor Brussels Airlines was taken over by Lufthansa in two stages, initially also starting 
with a minority stake.
Lufthansa is also looking to possibly take over Portugal's TAP.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair reported a first quarter profit of (EURO)663 million ($734 million), an increase of 290% 
from last year.
Earnings per share, in euro cent, was (EURO)58.22 compared to (EURO)16.53. First quarter revenue rose 40% to 
(EURO)3.65 billion.
Scheduled revenues increased 57% to (EURO)2.47 billion. Traffic grew 11% to 50.4 million customers.
The company expects fiscal 2024 traffic to grow to approximately 183.5 million, up 9%, which is slower than the 185 
million originally expected, due to Boeing delivery delays.
Ryanair remains cautiously optimistic that fiscal 2024 profit after tax will be modestly ahead of last year.

Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair plans to invest over $3 billion to rebuild Ukraine's aviation industry once 
the war ends and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) declares flying into and out of Ukraine is safe 
again.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary also promised a swift restart of flights in Ukraine after the end of the war, following a 
trip to Kiev on Thursday.
Ryanair will resume flights eight weeks after airspace reopens, the company said after meeting Ukrainian 
government representatives.
Up to 30 aircraft will be stationed at Kiev, Lviv and Odessa airports and 600 flights a week will be offered to 20 EU 
capitals, O'Leary said during the visit.
Within five years, the offer is to be doubled from initially five to 10 million seats per year.
Ryanair said it was the second largest airline in Ukraine before the invasion.
The airports in Kharkiv and Kherson are also to be returned to as soon as the infrastructure has been restored, 
O'Leary said in a statement.
Ryanair managers met Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration of Ukraine and Infrastructure Minister 
Oleksandr Kubrakov, a company statement said.
They also discussed Ukraine's main airports, Kiev, Lviv and Odessa in Boryspil International Airport, invited by 
Oleksiy Dubrevskyy, who heads Boryspil International Airport.
The Ryanair senior management examined the condition of airport terminals, baggage claim and passenger check-
in and boarding gate areas, control points, and aprons during the visit.
Ryanair to invest $3 billion, restart flights to Ukraine after war
Ryanair also plans to open daily domestic flights between Kiev, Lviv, and Odessa, as soon as the airports are 
operational.
Ryanair will base up to 30 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft worth over $3 billion at the three main Ukrainian airports, 
"giving Ukrainian citizens and visitors access to Europe's lowest air fares, as Ukraine rebuilds its economy in a post 
invasion environment," the statement said.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly 17 months ago. "Ryanair was Ukraine's second largest 
airline before the unlawful Russian invasion in February 2022," O'Leary said.
"Once the skies over Ukraine have reopened for commercial aviation, Ryanair will charge back into Ukraine linking 
the main Ukraine airports with over 20 EU capitals, and we are working closely with the Ukrainian government to 
rebuild Ukraine's aviation, industry and its economy."
"The fastest way to rebuild and restore the Ukrainian economy will be with low fare air travel," he said.

Nearly 60 flights to and from Belgium's Charleroi airport were cancelled on Sunday as pilots of low-cost airline 
Ryanair walked out on the second day of their planned two-day strike.
The walkout led to the cancellation of 29 flights arriving at and another 29 flights departing from Charleroi, 
according to information provided on the airport's website.
Together with flights already impacted on Saturday, a total of 120 flights are affected, news agency Belga reported 
on Saturday.
Belgian public broadcaster RTBF estimated that almost 8,000 passengers could not leave Belgium as planned.
On Saturday the pilots of Belgian-based Ryanair said they were ready to go on strike again if management doesn't 
meet their demands, RTBF reported.
The pilots and the budget airline are at odds over pay cuts and issues with rest periods.
The pilots are demanding that their salaries be restored to levels before the Covid-19 pandemic.
Pilots had at the time accepted a temporary pay cut to help the firm ride out the financial impact of travel restrictions 
imposed during the pandemic.
Ryanair does not offer flights from Charleroi to Germany.

Italy's nationwide air traffic strike on Saturday resulted in nearly 1,000 flight cancellations, the news agency ANSA 
reported on Sunday.
According to the unions, which had called for the strike, nearly 100% of employees expected to strike participated in 
the action, the agency said.
The walkout affected airport ground staff, which are responsible, among other things, for handling and check-in 
services.
At Italy's major airports in Rome, Milan, Naples and Venice alone, several hundred flights were cancelled, affecting 
about 250,000 passengers.
The consumer protection association Codacons believes that damages due to cancellations and delays were in the 
millions, ANSA reported further.
In addition to ground staff, pilots of Malta Air, who handle Ryanair flights in Italy, and pilots and flight attendants of 
budget airline Vueling also went on strike.
This was the second major walkout in Italy, following a rail strike on Thursday that caused significant problems for 
public transport.
The strikes are hitting the country, a popular holiday destination, in the middle of the peak travel season and during 
a heat wave with high temperatures.

A nationwide strike of transport workers began in Italy on Thursday, with staff of two major railway companies 
walking out of work in the morning.
Staff of the state-owned railway company Trenitalia, and employees of the private competitor Italo, stopped work at 
3 am (0100 GMT) on Thursday morning.
Operations are set to resume immediately after the strike is over, Trenitalia said on Wednesday evening. However, 
it is expected that the delays, some of them severe, could extend throughout the day.
Originally, the walkout was to last until 2 am on Friday morning. After failed negotiations with unions, Italy's 
Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini issued an order to shorten the strike to 12 hours, prompting 
criticism from several unions.
Further travel disruptions are planned for the weekend.

Umbrella European consumer protection organization BEUC and 23 of its members filed a complaint with the 
European Commission on Thursday against 17 European airlines, saying they misled the public about their 
environmental policies.
Lufthansa, Air France and Ryanair are among the airlines targeted by a so-called cease-and-desist complaint. The 
consumer groups claim the airlines breached EU rules on unfair commercial practices.
The 23 member organizations come from 19 EU countries, the BEUC wrote in a press release. The German 
consumer group VZBV is part of the action, which complains about so-called "greenwashing" practices, in which 
companies present policies as environmentally friendly when they are not.
"We are calling for a Europe-wide investigation into the issue and for the concerned airlines - and the entire sector - 
to stop making claims that give consumers the impression that flying is sustainable," the statement said.
"This is simply untrue as flying is not sustainable and is not bound to become so in the near future."
BEUC said its members had found numerous examples of misleading practices. For example, claims that CO2 
emissions can be "offset," "neutralized" or "compensated" are factually incorrect. The benefits of offsetting 
measures are highly uncertain, while the damage caused by CO2 emissions from air travel is certain.
The claim that air travel can be "sustainable", "responsible" or "green" is also misleading.
"None of the strategies employed by the aviation sector are currently capable of preventing greenhouse gas 
emissions."
Lufthansa said it had taken note of BEUC's announcement but had not yet received any complaints.
European consumers file 'greenwashing' complaint against airlines
"Irrespective of this, we naturally deal with every complaint we receive and examine it carefully," the airline said 
when queried for a response.
The group is striving for a neutral CO2 balance by 2050. By 2030, net CO2 emissions are to be halved compared to 
2019 through reduction and compensation measures.

German airline Lufthansa has agreed to take over a minority stake in the Italian airline ITA Airways, both airlines 
announced at the signing of the contract in Rome on Thursday.
ITA was formed in 2020 after a restructuring of the failed Alitalia, which the government in Rome took over in March 
of the same year when various takeover bids failed.
After months of negotiations this year with the Italian state, Lufthansa acquired an initial 40% of ITA's shares.
Earlier media reports said the German airline plans to pay between (EURO)320 million and (EURO)330 million 
($343.36 million-$354.09 million) for the stake.
Both parties have now confirmed the agreement in principle, but have not yet confirmed specific figures.
Once ITA Airways begins to make profit again, the reports said Lufthansa may then invest a further (EURO)500 
million to acquire 50% to 55% of its shares, which would be a majority stake.
The Italian state would thus remain a shareholder for the time being, in contrast to Lufthansa's initial plans.
The deal is subject to competition law reviews at both a national and European level.
While Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA) took over the flight operations of its insolvent predecessor Alitalia in October 
2021, it is not its legal successor.
ITA has, however, secured take-off and landing rights as well as the Alitalia brand. The legendary name could 
possibly soon be reactivated under the new corporate umbrella.
Germany 's Lufthansa to take over 40% stake in Italy 's ITA Airways
Lufthansa strategy chief Jörg Eberhart, who already headed the regional subsidiary Air Dolomiti operating in 
northern Italy, is being discussed as the new head of ITA.
Last year ITA made a loss of (EURO)486 million ($521 million) on a turnover of just under (EURO)1.6 billion. At the 
end of March, the company cited the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, increased fuel costs due to the 
Ukraine war and the poor euro-dollar exchange rate as the reasons for the figures in the red.
The target for 2027 is now 94 aircraft and a turnover of (EURO)4.1 billion.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr spoke of a win-win situation for Italy, ITA and his company. He wants to 
bring the lean Alitalia successor with its young fleet into the profit zone via higher load factors, cheaper purchasing 
and better flight coordination.
Lufthansa has wanted to gain a foothold in its second most important foreign market for many years. An attempt 
launched in 2009 under the name Lufthansa Italia came to an end in 2011.
At present, the Lufthansa Group only attracts transfer passengers from rich northern Italy to the Munich hub with 
flights operated by Air Dolomiti. Now, with ITA, Lufthansa is acquiring market share in an environment dominated by 
non-domestic low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG has already taken over the former state-owned airlines of neighbouring Switzerland, 
Austria and Belgium and has continued to operate them as independent brands.
The Belgian Sabena successor Brussels Airlines had been taken over by Lufthansa in two stages, initially also 
starting with a minority stake.
Another possible takeover target is TAP of Portugal.

A European Union court has annulled the approval for state aid granted to Italian airlines worth (EURO)130 million 
($140 million) during the Covid-19 pandemic in a ruling on Wednesday.
The EU General Court cancelled the European Commission's approval after finding that the basis for compatibility 
with EU law had not been sufficiently justified, according to a statement.
Budget airline Ryanair filed the complaint against the state support from Italy. It follows a similar court decision 
taken against German state aid awarded to German airline company Lufthansa.
The (EURO)130 million in funds was intended to compensate the airlines for damages suffered as a result of Covid-
19-related travel restrictions.
According to the EU General Court, the commission should have either explained why the competition authority had 
no issue with the state aid or started an investigation.
State support is usually closely regulated, however restrictions were loosened during the pandemic. The 
commission is the bloc's top authority on competition matters and approves state subsidies.
The ruling may be appealed at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the bloc's highest court.

A Belarusian blogger handed a jail sentence for opposition activities, Roman Protasevich, has been pardoned two 
years after his spectacular arrest and just a few weeks after his conviction.
"First and foremost, I am incredibly grateful to the country and the president personally for this decision," 
Protasevich said in Minsk on Monday, according to Belarusian media.
Protasevich was shown several times on Belarusian state television after his arrest, where he distanced himself 
from his opposition activism.
Protasevich's spectacular arrest in May 2021 caused a stir far beyond the borders of the ex-Soviet republic. 
Together with his then girlfriend Sofia Sapega, he was on a flight from Athens to Vilnius when the Ryanair plane 
was forced to land in Minsk by the Belarusian authorities because of an alleged bomb threat. Subsequently, both 
were detained.
Sapega, a Russian citizen, was later sentenced to six years in prison - and has since been transferred to Russia.
Protasevich was sentenced to eight years in prison in early May. The prosecution accused the former editor-in-chief 
of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta of an attempted coup d'état.
Nexta called for protests against the authoritarian ruler Alexander Lukashenko, who had himself declared the 
winner of the 2020 presidential election. Lukashenko brutally suppressed the subsequent street protests. The vote 
was not recognized internationally.
Protasevich's relatives assume that he made his pro-government statements in detention under pressure and 
torture.
Hundreds of Lukashenko opponents remain in prison. Many have rejected any kind of deal with the authorities.

A European Union court has annulled the approval for German state aid granted to Lufthansa worth (EURO)6 billion 
($6.6 billion) during the Covid-19 pandemic in a ruling on Wednesday.
The EU General Court cancelled the decision by the European Commission to approve the state aid, citing "several 
errors" in a statement.
The commission wrongly assumed Lufthansa could not borrow from financial markets, misjudged the German 
airline's market power at certain airports and agreed conditions which did not ensure effective competition between 
airlines, the EU court found.
The billion-euro aid package for Lufthansa was awarded in the spring of 2020 and received approval from the 
commission, the bloc's top competition watchdog, later in June.
Ryanair and German leisure airline Condor filed a legal case against the decision.
The EU's usually strict aid rules were loosened at the outbreak of the pandemic to allow governments to support 
struggling companies but still required commission approval.
Germany's largest airline, Lufthansa, received financial support from the government after Covid-19 travel 
restrictions brought business to a standstill.
Tens of thousands of jobs were on the line in the company, which employs around 110,000 people.
The ruling may be appealed at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the bloc's highest court.

Irish airline Ryanair has placed an order for 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft worth a total of $40 billion, the airline 
said on Tuesday.
Following the news, Boeing was seen trading up by 2.18% at $201.57 per share in the pre-market trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.
The aircraft are expected to be delivered during the period from 2027 to 2033. Boeing's B737-MAX-10 aircraft will 
enable Ryanair to facilitate a traffic growth of 80% from 168 million in March 2023 to 300 million a year by March 
2034.
Ryanair expects 50% of these deliveries will replace older B737NGs. In addition to significant revenue growth, the 
new order offers Ryanair with extra seats to further widen Ryanair's unit-cost advantage over all EU competitor 
airlines.
Ryanair Group chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "These new, fuel-efficient, greener technology aircraft offer 
21% more seats, burn 20% less fuel and are 50% quieter than our B737-NGs. This order, coupled with our 
remaining gamechanger deliveries, will create 10,000 new jobs for highly paid aviation professionals over the next 
decade, and these jobs will be located across all of Europe's main economies where Ryanair is currently the 
number 1 or number 2 airline."

Roman Protasevich, a prominent blogger and critic of the authoritarian Belarusian government whose 2021 arrest 
caused international outrage, was sentenced to eight years in a prison camp by a court in Minsk on Wednesday.
Prosecutors had accused the 27-year-old blogger of plotting to seize power, among other things, according to 
Belarusian state news agency Belta.
Protasevich, who used to be editor-in-chief of the opposition blog Nexta, is widely viewed internationally as a 
political prisoner.
His spectacular arrest in May 2021 caused outrage around the world. He was on a flight from Greece to Lithuania 
with his then-girlfriend Sofia Sapega when the Belarusian authorities forced the Ryanair plane to land in Minsk 
because of what they claimed was a bomb threat.
Both the blogger and Sapega were promptly arrested and imprisoned. Sapega, who is a Russian citizen, was 
sentenced to six years in prison.
After his arrest, Protasevich appeared several times on Belarusian state television, where he distanced himself from 
his opposition activities. However, relatives believe that his statements were coerced under immense pressure and 
possible torture.
Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko, who is also a close confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, 
has led a brutal and severe crackdown on political opponents and critics, especially after widespread anti-regime 
protests in the summer of 2020.

Air traffic to and from Germany this coming summer will remain significantly below the pre-pandemic level, the 
latest flight schedules show.
An analysis of the schedules by the German Aviation Association (BDL) found 128 million seats will be offered from 
April through September. This corresponds to 82% of the capacity in the same period in 2019.
Only in the North Africa-Levant region - Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco - is there 
more capacity on offer than four years ago, at 103%, the industry association said Thursday.
Domestic air traffic has fallen particularly sharply to 54% of the pre-crisis level.
Compared to the rest of Europe, the number of flights on offer in Germany is comparatively low. Point-to-point 
airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air have shifted business and growth from the German market to other countries.
In the rest of Europe except Germany, the number of seats on offer is 97% of the pre-crisis level.

Sanctions imposed against the state-owned company responsible for Belarusian airspace over the forced landing of 
a plane in May 2021 are lawful, the EU general court in Luxembourg ruled on Wednesday.
The lower court's decision can be appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
In May 2021, fighter jets from the Belarus airforce compelled Ryanair Flight FR4978, with more than 100 people on 
board, to land in Minsk on its way from Athens to Vilnius.
Among the passengers was the Belarusian blogger Roman Protasevich, who is critical of the government and co-
founder of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta, and his girlfriend at the time, Sofia Sapega. Both were arrested 
after landing.
The European Union then imposed sanctions, including entry bans and asset freezes.
The state-owned company Belaeronavigatsia, which is responsible for Belarusian airspace, filed a lawsuit 
challenging the sanctions, but was unsuccessful.
The judges said that Belaeronavigatsia "could not reasonably have been unaware" that this action would contribute 
"to the repression of civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus." 
The sanctions were also not disproportionate, the court ruled, as they were issued due to the ongoing disregard for 
human rights and the rule of law in Belarus.

"All people are well and safe," said Elena Dimopoulou, the airport spokesperson.
The plane had departed from the Polish city of Katowice with about 190 people on board, she said. Special police 
units checked the plane and the luggage.
The Greek state radio ERT reported that after the pilot called in the threat, fighter bombers were deployed and 
accompanied the aircraft until it landed safely.

Air travel in Germany is recovering more slowly than in other European countries, an industry association said 
on Friday.
For the first half of 2023, the number of seats on offer looks set to reach around 78% of the 2019 figure before the 
pandemic broke out, according to the German Aviation Association (BDL).
However, other European countries are already offering 94% of the pre-pandemic level, the group said.
That is partly due to a lower level of domestic air travel, at 56% of pre-pandemic flight capacity, the group said.
But it is also because low-cost airlines are giving most German airports a wide berth as they ramp up their offerings 
elsewhere. Current flight plans show that the number of connections from German airports are down more than a 
third compared to before the pandemic.
However, some low-cost point-to-point airlines such as Ryanair or Wizz have significantly expanded the number of 
flights they are offering since the pandemic in the rest of Europe outside of Germany, with 114% of the 2019 level.
Of all Germany's larger airports, only four - Dortmund, Hahn, Karlsruhe and Memmingen - will have more flights 
available than in the same period in 2019. All are used by lower-cost airlines.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had criticized German airports in the past for their high fees and announced plans to 
grow in other markets.

Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair is expecting a higher annual profit than expected after a surprisingly strong 
third quarter.
After taxes and adjusted for special items, the company announced on Wednesday that it expects to post a profit of 
(EURO)1.325 to 1.425 billion ($1.5 billion) if no negative events follow.
Previously, Ryanair had assumed a figure of (EURO)1 to 1.2 billion.
The company still expects 168 million passengers for the financial year ending on 30 March.
A profit of just under (EURO)200 million is likely to have been achieved in the third quarter, the Irish firm added. A 
strong pent-up demand from customers was noted in the holiday season as the majority of coronavirus restrictions 
in Europe were abolished.

Low-cost airline Ryanair has also entered into a cooperation agreement with Amadeus, the booking system 
provider used in many travel agencies.
All Ryanair connections will be bookable on the Amadeus travel platform from the end of 2022, the Irish airline 
announced on Friday. A corresponding contract was signed on the same day.
"We are pleased to announce this partnership with Amadeus, the world's leading travel technology company, 
further expanding Ryanair's offering and enabling corporate customers in particular greater access to our unrivalled 
network of connections, high frequencies, on-time performance, and unbeatable low fares as they return to 
collaborating with colleagues face-to-face," Ryanair's Dara Brady said.
The partnership expands Ryanair's offering and gives business customers in particular better access to the route 
network, it said. Lufthansa had already announced a cooperation with Amadeus in mid-September.
Amadeus belongs to the so-called global distribution systems that travel agencies in particular use for organizing 
and managing air travel and customer data.
"This partnership illustrates the value of our platform for low-cost carriers, offering the airline access to the widest 
network of travel sellers worldwide and the technology to help them get the most out of the indirect channel," Jose-
Luis Aragon, regional vice-president of the air distribution Europe department at Amadeus said.

Budget airline Ryanair announced a return to profit for the half-year period which ended on September 30, the 
company reported on Monday.
The Irish airline said its profit was (EURO)1.26 billion ($1.25 billion) or (EURO)1.1 per share, compared to a net 
loss of (EURO)47.6 million or (EURO)0.04 per share in the previous year.
Pre-exceptional profit after tax for the period was (EURO)1.37 billion, compared to a pre-Covid half year profit of 
(EURO)1.15 billion, due to record in the second quarter traffic, strong operational reliability and robust summer 
fares which in the second quarter were 14% up on pre-Covid pricing.
Total operating revenues for the quarter grew to (EURO)6.62 billion, up from (EURO)2.15 billion euros in the prior 
year.
While it remained dependent on Boeing meeting their delivery commitments, Ryanair modestly raised its fiscal year 
2023 traffic guidance to 168 million passengers, up from prior outlook of 166.5 million passengers.
Looking ahead for fiscal year 2023, Ryanair expects that it will minimize its winter losses which would deliver a 
profit after tax (pre-exceptionals) in a range of (EURO)1 billion to (EURO)1.20 billion.

German airline Lufthansa has reduced its domestic flight schedule to cut costs, which include high fees at the 
country's airports, chief executive Carsten Spohr has said.
Due to the high fees at German airports, Lufthansa is increasingly using its aircraft "more efficiently and profitably 
on other European routes," Spohr told dpa.
The carrier had also expanded cooperation with German railway operator Deutsche Bahn, the chief executive said.
Lufthansa and Deutsche Bahn have been offering a so-called Rail&Fly deal for years, with airline tickets for 
international flights including a train ride to a domestic airport.
Germany's domestic aviation sector has still not recovered from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which 
brought numerous travel restrictions, according to data compiled by the German Airports Association (ADV).
In September, some 1.9 million passengers were recorded on domestic flights, which accounts for only 45.3% of 
the pre-pandemic levels recorded in September of 2019.
In comparison, passenger levels on European flights have already returned to 80.2% compared to pre-pandemic 
levels, according to the ADV.
At the same time, domestic tickets were around 25% more expensive in August than three years earlier, according 
to Germany's Federal Statistical Office.
Lufthansa's domestic flights are mainly operated by the carrier itself as well as its subsidiary Eurowings, with 
competitors from abroad like low-cost airlines Easyjet and Ryanair having mostly withdrawn from the market.

A strike over pay and work conditions by employees of the Italian air traffic control company Enav led to hundreds 
of flights to and from Italy being cancelled on Friday.
Italy's state-owned ITA Airways cancelled just over 200 flights, most of them domestic. Other airlines, like low-cost 
carriers easyJet and Eurowings, have also scrubbed flights from their schedules.
Ryanair alone said more than 600 flights were cancelled and about 110,000 passengers affected.
Air traffic control unions CGIL, CISL and UIL had called for the work stoppage, which was expected to affect Rome, 
Milan Malpensa and Venice airports the hardest.
The strike was known by airlines and passengers well in advance, resulting in few long queues or crowded airport 
halls. Compared to the usual volume of passengers on a Friday, Terminal 1 at Rome's Fiumicino was "half empty," 
according to the ANSA news agency.
"We apologize to all passengers who may be inconvenienced because of the strike," UIL wrote in a statement. It 
said Enav's stance toward workers' demands made the labour action unavoidable.
The unions demand changes in working hours and schedules from the partly state-owned Enav. The unions said 
they would press ahead with their demands - if necessary - with further protest actions.
The last strike at Enav was on July 17. At that time, too, numerous flights were cancelled in the middle of the 
summer vacation season, leaving passengers stranded at airports.

Mosi-oa-Tuny - "the smoke that thunders" - is what the locals call the spectacular Victoria Falls in the border region 
of Zimbabwe and Zambia, said to be the widest continuous waterfalls in the world.
A visit can easily be combined with a safari excursion as the Zambezi river is also the natural habitat of many wild 
animals and a paradise for bird-watchers.
This week in the travel and events section from the dpa trends and features desk, we're giving you some highlights 
of Zimbabwe, plus an Italian museum deciding to make its biggest attraction share the spotlight.

Budget airline Ryanair is planning to raise prices as fuel becomes more expensive, the head of the Irish firm's 
German business told dpa.
"The average price for a Ryanair ticket is likely to rise from 40 to 50 euros [$38.6 to $48.2] in five years," Andreas 
Gruber said.
The airline is trying to reduce the impact of rising oil prices with futures contracts that fix prices and by buying cheap 
paraffin for its stocks, but it cannot completely cushion rising fuel prices, said Gruber, who is also head of Ryanair 
subsidiary Laudamotion.
The airline sees itself at an advantage over more expensive rivals amid economic hard times.
"In the recession, more people will pay attention to the ticket price," Gruber said.
Ryanair is not alone in raising prices: Lufthansa for example has announced higher fares for the rest of the year.
Ryanair appears to have let behind the slump in passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic.
In the current financial year (April 2022 to March 2023), Ryanair is expected to transport 166 million passengers in 
Europe, well above the level before the pandemic hit.
In the next financial year, passenger numbers should rise to 185 million, Gruber said.

Ryanair cancels several Budapest flights due to 'excess profit tax'

Body
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is cancelling several flights to and from Budapest because of a new excess profit tax in 
Hungary.
The move affects eight out of 53 destinations that will be cancelled completely and seven other routes where the 
number of flights will be reduced, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said at a press conference in Budapest on 
Tuesday.
"The Hungarian [government's] idiotic 'excess profits' tax on the loss-making air transport sector (and Hungarian 
citizens/visitors) has done nothing but damage Hungarian tourism, connectivity, traffic, and jobs as evidenced by 
these severe cuts to our Budapest winter schedule, which were made in direct response to this ridiculous 'excess 
profits' tax," he said.
Hungary's right-wing nationalist government introduced the tax in July this year to skim off real or perceived excess 
profits from various sectors of the economy.
Among others, energy companies, banks, insurance and telecom firms have fallen under the new taxation. Airlines 
have to pay around (EURO)10 ($10) to the state for each ticket departing from a Hungarian airport.
Ryanair immediately included this amount in their ticket prices. However, the relevant Hungarian tax law explicitly 
prohibits this practice. The Hungarian consumer protection authority therefore fined the Irish airline 300 million 
forints ($752,725) in August.
Ryanair announced that it would take legal action and, if necessary, go to EU courts: The airline argues that the 
Hungarian ban on offsetting tax increases with price increases violates European law.

In Spain, 92 domestic flights are being cancelled, affecting some 17,000 passengers, due to a ten-day strike by 
cabin crew working for Iberia Express, the budget airline that is part of the Iberia group.
The flights that are being cancelled include connections from Madrid to Palma de Mallorca, Gran Canaria, Santiago 
de Compostela, Seville, Málaga and Tenerife, Spanish trade union USO said on Friday. They were due to depart 
between August 28 and September 6.
The cabin crew are holding the strike demanding the company start negotiating on a collective agreement and raise 
salaries, frozen since 2015, to the higher cost of living.
So far, only 24 flights between Sunday and Tuesday are definitely cancelled due to the industrial action, Iberia 
Express said, according to El País newspaper.
The Spain-based cabin crew of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair are also demanding better working conditions by 
striking from Monday to Thursday each week, which began on August 8 and is due to continue until January 7, 
2023. Ryanair is not complying with the law and is also refusing to negotiate, workers said.
British budget airline Easyjet cabin crew also went on strike for better working conditions in Spain this summer, but 
called an early end to the protest in July after reaching an agreement with management.
The wave of summer strikes has had little impact on passengers in Spain due to regulations maintaining minimum 
services. Even when staff walk out, often only a relatively small proportion of flights are cancelled.

The start of a long-planned strike by Ryanair cabin crew in Spain caused only limited disruption at the country's 
airports.
Ten flights had been cancelled on Monday and there had been 111 delays by the afternoon, the USO trade union 
said.
The Dublin-based budget airline predicted that operations over the months ahead would be disrupted minimally if at 
all.
Ryanair's Spain-based cabin crew are demanding an improvement in working conditions. Following unsuccessful 
strike action in in June and July, the unions involved, USO and Sitcpla, said crew would strike between Monday and 
Thursday every week from Monday up to January 7 next year.
They accused Ryanair of failing to comply with Spanish law in refusing to negotiate.
Among the demands are observing "basic labour rights," including at least 22 days' holiday per year, 
implementation of occupational health and safety legislation and raising pay to the level that applied before the 
pandemic.
The airports affected include the main hubs at Madrid, Barcelona and Mallorca, and also Málaga, Sevilla, Alicante, 
Valencia, Girona, Ibiza and Santiago de Compostela.
The maintenance of "minimal service" prescribed under Spanish law during strikes means that only some flights 
can be cancelled, usually only a relatively small number.

The Spanish-based cabin crew of low-cost carrier EasyJet cancelled their strike planned for the weekend after 
reaching a pay agreement with management.
The work stoppages scheduled for Friday through Sunday have been called off, the Spanish union USO announced 
on Thursday.
It said the British airline had promised a 22% pay increase spread over the next three years. The USO called this a 
"significant" improvement, although not as high as the 40% it had hoped to achieve.
More than 300 of the some 400 flight attendants working for EasyJet in Spain had voted on the agreement and 
approved it by nearly 75%, the union said.
Cabin crews stationed in Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca and Málaga had gone on strike for more money between 
July 1 and 3 and between July 15 and 17. In total, the employees planned to strike for nine days in July.
The basic salary of EasyJet flight attendants in Spain is currently (EURO)950 ($967 dollars) a month, according to 
USO. That is (EURO)850 less than in Germany or France, it said.
"With the basic salary, we can hardly pay the rent or the mortgage," the representative of the airline employees at 
USO, Miguel Galán, had said.
A day earlier Ryanair cabin crew, who have been on strike for better working conditions and pay in Spain since the 
end of June, announced a five-month extension of their walkout.
Between August 8 and January 7, 2023, they will strike every week from Monday to Thursday, the USO and Sitcpla 
unions announced.

Cabin crew at the low-cost airline Ryanair, who have been on strike for better working conditions in Spain since the 
end of June, are extending their walkouts for another five months.
The Spanish unions USO and Sitcpla announced on Wednesday that they would strike every week from Monday to 
Thursday between August 8 and January 7, 2023.
The four-day-a-week strike was instituted as the Irish airline is not complying with Spanish law and is also refusing 
to negotiate, they said.
They are demanding compliance with "basic labour rights" such as 22 working days of annual leave, 14 statutory 
public holidays, implementation of the Health and Safety at Work Act and a pay rise to pre-pandemic levels.
Ryanair cabin crew have already called a total of 18 strike days since June 24 and up to Thursday, but so far these 
have not led to a resolution of the industrial dispute.
These work stoppages have led to the cancellation of a total of about 300 flights and about 3,000 delays, the state 
television station RTVE reported on Wednesday.
Numerous airports are affected by the Ryanair strikes: Málaga, Seville, Alicante, Valencia, Girona, Ibiza and 
Santiago de Compostela, in addition to Madrid, Barcelona and Mallorca.
However, because of the requirement by Spanish law for airlines to maintain "minimum services" during strikes, 
only a - often relatively small - proportion of flights has actually been cancelled.
In the case of the Ryanair strikes, for example, the Transport Ministry recently decided that at least 73% to 82% of 
all scheduled flights must be completed on the strike days, depending on the airport, meaning the impact on 
travellers has been limited.

The International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO has deemed the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Belarus in 
May 2021 was "unlawful interference."
The Montreal-based UN specialized agency released a Tuesday statement after evaluating new material including 
audio recordings from the Minsk air traffic controller.
The bomb threat cited as a reason for the emergency landing was "deliberately false," endangered flight safety and 
was based on instructions from senior Belarusian government officials, the ICAO found.
Belarusian authorities forced Ryanair flight FR4978, which was on its way from Athens to Vilnius with more than 
100 people on board, to land in Minsk.
The anti-government Belarusian blogger Roman Protasevich, co-founder of the opposition Telegram 
channel Nexta, and his girlfriend at the time, Sofia Sapega, were among those on board.
Both were detained after the plane landed. The European Union closed its airspace to Belarusian aircraft 
afterwards.
Sapega was sentenced to six years in prison in May for running an opposition channel on Telegram. She asked 
Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko for a pardon in late June.
Protasevich is still facing trial, according to media reports.
The US indicted four Belarusian government officials in absentia in January over the forced landing.
Prosecutors in New York charged them with "conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy." They said four US citizens were 
among the passengers.

US aircraft manufacturer Boeing kept its nose ahead of European rival Airbus in the race for new orders on the 
second day of the Farnborough International Airshow outside of London.
Private equity firm 777 Partners was buying 30 more Boeing 737 MAX medium-haul planes, the manufacturer said 
on Tuesday.
The aircraft will be a special 737-8-200 version with more seats and additional doors, which Boeing developed for 
low-cost carriers such as Ryanair.
There is also a preliminary contract with 777 Partners for 36 more aircraft.
Airbus meanwhile reported an order from US airline Delta for 12 A220-300 aircraft, the longer version of the 
smallest Airbus model A220.
On Monday, Delta said it was ordering 100 of Boeing's 737-10 jets, with options for an additional 30 planes from the 
company.
The Farnborough trade show, which runs through the week, is staged every two years and has become a venue for 
Boeing and Airbus to face off for new orders.

Due to a threatened work stoppage at Italian airports, travellers have to be prepared for delays and cancellations of 
numerous flights on Sunday.
Several trade unions called on staff of the air traffic control company ENAV as well as the low-cost airlines Ryanair, 
EasyJet and Volotea to take part in the four-hour work stoppage, according to notices from the trade union 
confederations.
The reason is a dispute over workers' rights, working conditions and the payment of minimum wages in the 
industry.
EasyJet has cancelled flights from Milan's Linate airport to Berlin and from Rome-Fiumicino to Amsterdam because 
of the strike. Ryanair said it had been forced to cancel some flights because of the strike at ENAV. Passengers had 
already been informed, the airline said.
According to ENAV, the work stoppage will last from 2 pm to 6 pm (1200-1600 GMT). Flights between 7 am and 10 
am and 6 pm to 9 pm will not be affected.
With work stoppages looming, Tourism Minister Massimo Garavaglia called during the week for everything to be 
done to avoid inconvenience in the recovering sector.
"An unrest among air traffic control staff threatens to block the most dynamic sector of the economy, which is 
currently driving the country's growth to a significant extent. To block transport is to block the country," said the 
politician from the far-right Lega party, which is considered pro-business.

European budget airline Ryanair will save around $1.5 billion this year due to long-term jet fuel supply contracts, 
chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday in Vienna.
The airline will receive the majority of the fuel it needs until March 2023 at a price of roughly $73 per barrel while 
prices have recently risen to up to $120 per barrel.
"We have secured all the fuel we need at much lower prices," O'Leary said.
Ryanair will be able to transport over 200 million passengers annually within a few years, O'Leary said, compared 
to around 150 million before the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Irish company is in talks with around 30 to 40 airports about setting up new routes. O'Leary announced 
connections from Vienna to Helsinki, Copenhagen, and Tuzla for the winter flight plan.
Vienna is among the fastest-growing locations of the Ryanair Group. It employs around 16,000 people overall and 
boasts a fleet of 470 planes.

The cabin crew staff at low-cost airline Ryanair plans to strike for better working conditions on 12 more days in July, 
as a wave of industrial action hits Spain during the busy holiday season.
The walkouts have been scheduled for July 12-15, 18-21, and 25-28, the Spanish unions USO and Sitcpla 
announced on Saturday.
Numerous airports are affected by the Ryanair strikes: Madrid, Barcelona and Mallorca, as well as Málaga, Seville, 
Alicante, Valencia, Girona, Ibiza and Santiago de Compostela.
Ryanair cabin crew had already gone on strike in Spain at the end of June and also between Thursday and 
Saturday. The Irish airline "does not respect court rulings and laws and uses fear, coercion and threats against its 
workers," USO said. Labour Minister Yolanda Díaz must intervene, it said.
The cabin crew of rival airline Easyjet will also stop work in Spain on a total of nine days between through the end 
of July - as early as this weekend, as well as between July 15-17 and between July 29-31.
In the case of the British airline, the cabin crew is demanding significantly higher salaries as well as a limit to flying 
times, as is the case in other countries.
On Saturday, 15 flights were cancelled throughout Spain by the afternoon because of the strikes - 10 Ryanair and 
five Easyjet flights - state television station RTVE reported, citing the authorities. In addition, there were around 200 
delays.
However, there were no cancellations on Mallorca on Saturday for the time being.

Because of the maintenance of "minimum services" prescribed by Spanish legislation in the event of strikes, only 
some flights, often only a relatively small proportion - may be cancelled.
In the case of the Ryanair strikes, for example, the Transport Ministry in Madrid decided that between 73% (Alicante

A prominent critic of the Belarusian government, who hit the headlines when she and her then-partner were 
removed from a Ryanair plane forced to land in Minsk, has petitioned for clemency after more than a year in 
custody, according to a media report.
According to the BBC's Russian-language service, Sofia Sapega wrote that her support for the Belarusian 
opposition was attributable to "youth and stupidity." The Russian national also wrote that she now recognized the 
movement's lawlessness and illegitimacy.
It is unclear under what circumstances she wrote the plea.
Belarus was rocked by protests in 2020 after election results that returned Alexander Lukasehnko to the presidency 
were widely derided as fixed. Authorities cracked down hard on the protest movement, with many jailed and others 
fleeing the country.
One who fled was blogger Roman Protasevich. However, he was taken into custody in 2021 after a flight he was 
on, travelling from Athens to Vilnius, was forced to land in Belarus after officials there cited a bomb threat.
Sapega was also on the plane and taken into custody. She was sentenced to six years because she was 
responsible for an opposition news channel on the Telegram messaging service.
The incident prompted an airspace ban from the European Union, which had already laid sanctions on Belarus due 
to allegations of election tampering. Officials were especially angered by the fact that the flight was between two 
EU countries, but was still rerouted.
Protasevich, who operated the opposition Telegram channel Nexta, has also apologized for his prior government 
opposition in jailhouse interviews. Opposition members say Protasevich's new comments were likely coerced.

The CSC trade union also criticizes, among other things, that there is no food or drink on board for staff to consume 
and that wage cuts are being imposed under the threat of mass lay-offs.
The nearly 130 flights were cancelled on Friday and over the weekend at Charleroi, one of the two main airports the 
Belgian capital, according to the Belga news agency.
Meanwhile, pilots and cabin crew at Brussels Airlines have been on strike in Belgium since Thursday. The 
employees of the Lufthansa subsidiary say they are suffering under an increasingly heavy workload.
The airline announced before the start of the three-day strike that 40,000 passengers were expected to be affected. 
Belga reported that 315 flights would be cancelled by Saturday.

German airline Lufthansa is cancelling more than 2,000 additional flights at its Frankfurt and Munich hubs due to 
staff shortages.
The company announced two weeks ago that it would cancel 900 connections in July. Now it will "take out of the 
system a further 2,200 of a total of 80,000 flights," Lufthansa said on Thursday.
"The cancellations will affect domestic German and intra-European flights in particular, but not the classic holiday 
destinations that are well utilized during this season," the company said, adding that flight schedules could also 
change.
"Aviation security strikes, weather events and in particular an increased rate of staff sick with Covid-19 have put 
additional strain on the system," Lufthansa said, explaining the decision.
Lufthansa passengers would be informed immediately of cancellations and, if possible, rebooked on other suitable 
flights. Alternatively, feeder flights within Germany could be replaced by train travel to the hubs, from where the 
planes would then take off for foreign destinations.
Lufthansa said it hoped the reduction to its schedule would "ensure greater overall stability."
In Brussels, meanwhile, strikes this week at Lufthansa Group's Brussels Airline, along with low-cost Irish carrier 
Ryanair, were affecting tens of thousands of passengers at the city's main Brussels Airport and the Brussels South 
Charleroi Airport.
Brussels Airlines alone cancelled more than 300 flights. Some 40,000 passengers are expected to be affected due 
to the walk-outs by cabin crew and pilots from Thursday to Saturday.
Lufthansa slashes 2,000 more flights in July due to staff shortages
They say they are suffering from heavy workloads and worsening work conditions.
Employees of Ryanair are planning an industrial action from Friday to Sunday. According to the Belga news 
agency, 80 Ryanair connections at Charleroi airport are to be cancelled.
Ryanair workers are demanding compliance with Belgian minimum wage rules for cabin crew.

Ryanair loses EU court case on state aid given to rival Finnair
Ryanair loses EU court case on state aid given to rival Finnair

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair lost a legal challenge against the EU's approval of millions in pandemic-related state 
aid to rival Finnair, according to a ruling published on Wednesday.
The aid given by the Finnish government was compatible with EU law, judges at the Luxembourg-based General 
Court said.
Finland had notified authorities it was providing financial aid to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros to the ailing 
airline Finnair in 2020. The aid was then approved by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.
Ryanair challenged the commission's decision, citing a lack of a formal review process and the violation of 
principles regarding equal treatment.
The court dismissed the action on the grounds of faulty reasoning on the part of Ryanair.
In the judges' view, it was sufficient that Finnair had serious difficulties in maintaining flight operations and that a 
default would have had a considerable impact on the Finnish economy.
Ryanair has taken action against the European Commission on several occasions regarding state aid offered to 
competitors to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Recently, the EU court had rejected a complaint against millions in aid that went to the German airline Condor. In 
other cases, however, Ryanair's lawsuits have met with success.

From Berlin or London to New York or Los Angeles: Budget airline startup Norse Atlantic Airways wants to do for 
transatlantic flights what Ryanair and EasyJet has done for travel across Europe.
The company plans to shake up transatlantic travel with returns as low as $316 and has announced plans to 
connected US hubs to London, Berlin and Oslo.
This week in the travel and events section from the dpa trends and features desk, we've looked at how transatlantic 
flights could become more affordable and also how Myanmar's military junta is trying to pull in tourists even as it 
carries out systematic killings of protesters.

When planning the next vacation, it can be quite tempting to book the (EURO)30 Ryanair flight, instead of the 15-
hour train journey that's likely to cost heaps more.
However, flying is known to have the most harmful environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions per person - so 
it might be time to tweak our travel plans.
This week in the travel and events section from the dpa trends and features desk, we've looked at carbon 
calculators which help you to work out your trip's carbon footprint and suggest alternative modes of transport or 
routes that could help to minimize the impact of your journey.

Irish budget airline Ryanair has come under fire for language tests it requires South African passengers to take 
before flying to Britain.
Several people affected expressed outrage on social media because they were asked to take a test with several 
knowledge questions in Afrikaans, the BBC and several other media outlets reported on Monday.
Afrikaans is one of several official languages in South Africa and is only spoken by a predominantly white minority 
of the population.
Those affected complained that the practice was discriminatory and reminiscent of the oppressive system in the 
country's apartheid-era discrimination against people of non-European descent.
Ryanair, when asked by dpa, said it had introduced the test in Afrikaans after becoming aware of an increased 
incidence of forged South African passports.
"If they are unable to complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund," it added.
The test is not a requirement of British border authorities, the BBC reported.

Seven of the largest European airlines are failing to take credible action on their climate ambitions, environmental 
organization Greenpeace said in a press release on Wednesday.
"Europe's biggest airlines are putting up a smokescreen of false solutions to distract from their staggering 
emissions, and keep transport in the EU hooked on oil," said Herwig Schuster, a spokesperson for the organization.
A report commissioned by Greenpeace looked at seven airlines including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, the 
International Airlines Group IAG (which includes British Airways), Easyjet, and Ryanair.
Greenpeace accused the airlines of hiding their emissions behind false promises and "greenwashing," while not 
doing enough to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
In order to keep global warming from lifting the world's temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius, Greenpeace has said 
that European airlines will have to reduce their air traffic by at least 2% annually between now and 2040.
However, "none of the companies analysed has annual reduction goals for its greenhouse gas emissions, 
committed to reduce flights, or pledged to fully decarbonise by 2040," the press release stated.
A spokesperson for Lufthansa said that the airline will look carefully at the Greenpeace study, and that the airline 
has plans to halve net CO2 emissions by 2030 from their 2019 levels.
Easyjet also responded, saying that it is aware of its responsibility and is working on becoming more climate 
friendly.
Ryanair said that the data and conclusions of the report are outdated, and that it has an ambitious climate strategy.

Masks required on flights to and from Germany despite looser EU rules

Despite loosened EU restrictions from Monday, passengers flying to and from Germany will still be required to wear 
masks in flight, according to the interior ministry in Berlin.
FFP2 or medical masks must be worn during boarding and disembarking and throughout the flight.
They may only be removed for eating and drinking. Children under the age of six are exempt from the requirement.
The ministry explained that the mask requirement corresponds to the new EU recommendations.
The aviation security agency EASA and the EU health authority ECDC no longer recommend that masks be worn in 
airports and on planes as a general rule from Monday.
But if masks are compulsory at the point of departure or the destination, masks need to be worn during the flight.
In Germany the nationwide mask requirement on planes and long-distance trains remains in place until September 
23. Masks are also compulsory on local bus and train transport.
German Transport Minister Volker Wissing and the transport industry have called for the mask requirement on 
planes, trains and buses to be scrapped.
However, the federal government has no plans to abolish the mask requirement for the time being.
Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) explained that, with the number of coronavirus cases still very high, "there is 
no scope to do without masks on public transport."
In general, relaxed EU rules do not mean that masks are no longer required on all flights. Europe's largest low-cost 
airline Ryanair has published a list of 15 EU countries in which national laws still require the wearing of face masks 
to prevent the spread of the virus.
Masks required on flights to and from Germany despite looser EU rules
Besides Germany, these include popular tourist destinations such as Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy.

One of the two people detained in Belarus last year after Minsk forced a Greece-to-Lithuania flight to land so it 
could take them into custody - an event that enraged the European Union - has been sentenced to jail for 
incitement and making threats.
Sofia Sapega was on the Ryanair flight last May when it crossed over Belarusian airspace. Authorities in Minsk 
initially forced the flight to land in Minsk after alleging there had been a bomb on board.
She was travelling with her boyfriend, Belarusian blogger Roman Protasevich, who is believed to have been the 
main target of the action. He was a key leader in 2020 protests against widely disputed elections that returned 
Alexander Lukashenko to another term as president in Belarus before fleeing the country.
Sapega's sentence was announced by human rights group Viasna. The group reported on its website that "there's 
been a harsh verdict against the political prisoner Sofia Sapega: six years of prison and a 167,500-rouble 
fine [about $50,000]."
The EU decried the incident, noticing it endangered aerial safety and interrupted a flight travelling between two 
EU countries. In its wake, the EU blocked Belarusian airlines from its airspace in the aftermath.
Sapega had been accused of incitement, urging people to conduct violence and murders and insulting government, 
police and court officials.
Protasevich's trial is under way, according to media reports. The one-time editor of a Telegram news channel has 
appeared on state TV multiple times since his detention to distance himself from his former opposition allies. Those 
close to him say he is making the statements under duress.

Passenger numbers jumped from half a million to 11.2 million in the year to March, reported carrier Ryanair on 
Monday.
However, it noted that March traffic was impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which caused 2,000 flights to 
and from Ukraine to be cancelled in the month.
Ryanair operated more than 67,800 flights in March. Load factor was 87% compared to 77%, prior year. For the 
rolling annual period, load factor was 82% compared to 71%, last year.
Rolling annual traffic increased to 97.1 million guests from 27.5 million. Ryanair said it expects to report a pre-
exceptional fiscal 2022 net loss of between (EURO)350 million ($386.6 million) and (EURO)400 million. The 
previously guided loss range was (EURO)250 million to (EURO)450 million.

EU member states agreed new sanctions on Belarus, Russia's ally in the invasion of Ukraine, the French 
presidency of the European Council announced on Wednesday on Twitter.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Sunday new sanctions on Belarus, "the 
other aggressor" in the invasion of Ukraine.
Russia launched offensives against Ukraine from Belarus which borders the country to the north. Minsk's 
strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko is considered an ally and military supporter of Kremlin leader Vladimir 
Putin.
Von der Leyen said the measures are to target Belarus' most important export products such as minerals, fuels, 
tobacco, wood, cement, iron and steel.
Personal sanctions are also to target Belarusian officials that support Russia's invasion, von der Leyen said.
The sanctions package is to enter into force as soon as the measures are published in the EU Official Journal 
according to France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
The EU already enacted far-reaching sanctions targeting Belarus last year because of Lukashenko's repression of 
civil society, the forced rerouting of a Ryanair plane and the orchestration of a migrant crisis on the bloc's border.

Lufthansa loses ECJ lawsuit in dispute over airport state aid
Lufthansa loses ECJ lawsuit in dispute over airport state aid

Lufthansa has lost a years-long dispute over millions of euros in state aid for a regional airport in the German state 
of Rhineland-Palatinate.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) on Thursday rejected a complaint by the German airline regarding the state's 
support for Frankfurt-Hahn Airport.
Among other things, the case concerned a credit line - comparable to an overdraft facility on a current account - 
amounting to 45 million euros (51 million dollars).
In addition, the court decided that Lufthansa must pay the costs of the proceedings for the western German state 
and the European Commission.
The airport received aid from 2009 until 2011, which was given the okay in Brussels in 2014.
Lufthansa had already taken its complaint to the Court of Justice of the European Union but was unsuccessful 
there.
The airline has never flown regularly to the airport. It is critical of the subsidies because low-cost competitor Ryanair 
takes off from Frankfurt-Hahn.
The ECJ ruled that the lower court's ruling had been correct and had rightfully noted that Lufthansa was not 
individually impacted by the aid for the regional airport.
Lufthansa has won - and lost - a number of other lawsuits regarding whether state support for Frankfurt-Hahn 
Airport distorted competition.
Meanwhile, the former military airport filed for insolvency in October 2021.

In 2017, the Chinese conglomerate HNA acquired 82.5 per cent of the airport from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate 
for around 15 million euros. The remaining 17.5 per cent is still held by the neighbouring state of Hesse, where the 
city of Frankfurt is located.

Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair is giving up its base at Frankfurt Airport, the company announced on 
Friday.
The five aircraft still stationed there will be redistributed to cheaper airports as of March 31, it said.
Ryanair gave as a reason for the decision the rise in take-off and landing fees at Germany's largest airport at the 
turn of the year.
Passengers with tickets already booked are to be notified in the coming days and receive refunds.
Ryanair said it is offering alternative positions for the affected crews within its rapidly growing European network.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said that traffic for the month of December surged to 9.5 million 
passengers from last year's 1.9 million.
The Dublin-based airline group's load factor was 81 per cent compared to 73 per cent a year ago.
Ryanair operated more than 62,200 flights last month, a typically busy time thanks to year-end holidays.
In the preceding month of November traffic was 10.2 million passengers, with 86 per cent load factor.
More broadly, airlines are still struggling to cope with the reduction in customers due to travel restrictions and 
coronavirus fears, with Omicron now wreaking new havoc on the industry.

Lufthansa cancels flights as pilots call in sick

German airline Lufthansa has had to cancel several intercontinental flights during the Christmas period because a 
number of its pilots are off sick, a company spokesperson said on Thursday.
Particularly affected are services flying to Boston, Houston and Washington through December 26, with only a few 
volunteers able to jump in and take over routes. The representative said those flights could, at least, be more easily 
rebooked. There were also flights to Japan that had to be cancelled.
The company planned "a very large buffer. But that is not sufficient considering the extremely high sickness rate," 
he added.
The spokesperson would not be drawn on whether the high sickness rate was linked to the coronavirus outbreak, 
which is currently being driven by the new Omicron variant. He said he was not aware of the nature of the illness 
among pilots.
Many of the absences are hitting crews for long-distance flights on Airbus A330s and A340s through early January.
Aero.de, a website focusing on German aviation, posted excerpts from a letter circulated by Lufthansa officials 
warning that the shortages could be severe.
"We don't see ourselves in the position to staff all routes because of increased sickness rates. Crew planners are 
working on scenarios that involve thinning out flight plans."
The airline's problems don't end with staff calling in sick. Several crew members have also had to go into quarantine 
due to the pandemic, further complicating flight planning.
Lufthansa cancels flights as pilots call in sick
The wave of sick calls comes amid talks between Cockpit, a pilots' union, and Lufthansa about corporate 
reorganizations that might cut certain high-paid piloting jobs. There is the possibility of strikes in the summer.
The cancellations have also called into question Lufthansa's promises to come up with emergency plans amid the 
coronavirus crisis. It had promised to keep reserve crew on hand and to introduce more flexibility into planning.
This Christmas travel season is shaping up to be a strong one for carriers operating in Europe. Some are reporting 
double-digit growth in flights offered, including Easyjet, which is operating 41 per cent more flights than two weeks 
ago, and Wizz Air, which has 75 per cent more flights this week than a week ago, according to data from flight 
safety organization Eurocontrol.
Ryanair, SAS and Wizz are also offering more connections than they did for the same time period in 2019, before 
the pandemic had hit Europe. Meanwhile, Lufthansa is down 21 per cent relative to 2019, though it recently 
managed a 1-per-cent improvement compared to two weeks prior.

The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has lowered its forecast for the current business year, announcing in Dublin on 
Wednesday that it was now expecting an even higher loss due to the spread of the Omicron variant and the 
associated travel restrictions.
Ryanair is now forecasting a net loss of between 250 million and 450 million euros (283 million and 510 million 
dollars) for the financial year that runs until the end of March 2022. Previously the airline was expecting to make a 
loss of between 100 million and 200 million euros.
In terms of passenger volume, the group says it now expects to transport fewer than 100 million passengers this 
year. The figures depended heavily on the further course of the pandemic, it said.
Ryanair has reduced its flights by 33 per cent for January, while a decision on its schedule has yet to be made for 
February and March.
The company said it hoped to have more clarity on the impact of the Omicron variant on European travel 
restrictions when it presents its third quarter figures on January 31.

An officer of the Belarusian KGB was in the air-traffic control tower of Minsk Airport when a Ryanair flight with 
dissident blogger Roman Protasevich on board was diverted earlier this year, the Polish government said on 
Thursday.
"He gave instructions to the staff member who had the contact with the pilot," a statement from Poland's ABW 
secret service and the attorney general said.
Investigators also established that there was no bomb threat for the flight, contrary to the warning given to the pilot 
by air-traffic control. The threat was communicated before an email purporting that explosives were on board had 
even been sent, according to the statement.
The findings are based on interviews with passengers and airline representatives, as well as examinations of the 
aircraft and analysis of recorded conversations.
The Ryanair plane is registered in Poland so Warsaw initiated investigations.
On May 23, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius to land in 
Minsk, claiming that a bomb threat had been received.
Protasevich, co-founder of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were on the 
flight. Both were arrested after landing.
The European Union, Britain and the United States imposed renewed sanctions against Belarus following the 
incident.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is returning to Nuremberg airport with a base.
Two aircraft are to be stationed in the southern German city in the summer of 2022 and 13 new destinations will be 
served, mainly in southern, south-eastern and eastern Europe, the airline announced in Nuremberg on Wednesday.
"We never wanted to leave in the first place and now we're back," Ryanair chief executive Eddie Wilson said.
Ryanair had closed its base in Nuremberg in 2019. At the time, the airline had justified its withdrawal, among other 
things, with the flight ban at the time following crashes of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft that were based there.
Since then, there have been fewer Ryanair flights from Nuremberg and no aircraft stationed there.
In total, Ryanair will be able to reach 27 destinations with 85 flights per week from March 2022, including the 
Estonian capital Tallinn, the Bulgarian capital Sofia, Chania on Crete, Venice in Italy and Faro in Portugal.
Nuremberg's Lord Mayor Marcus Koenig spoke of a balanced mix of European city connections, tourist destinations 
around the Mediterranean and opportunities for family visits in Central and Eastern Europe.
According to Ryanair, it plans to invest 200 million dollars in the new base.
More than 60 direct jobs will be created, and around 970 jobs are expected to be created in the region as a result of 
the increased number of flights in the area.

Frankfurt-based air carrier Lufthansa made a small operating profit in the summer on the back of strong demand for 
its air freight services and a recovery in ticket sales, chief executive Carsten Spohr said on Wednesday.
During the year as a whole, Spohr is aiming to at least halve the operating loss - adjusted earnings before interest 
and tax - that the airline incurred during 2020, the year of the pandemic.
Last year, Lufthansa saw an operating loss of almost 5.5 billion euros (6.4 billion dollars).
"With rising demand for business travel and a record result of Lufthansa Cargo we have mastered another 
milestone on our way out of the crisis: We are back to black. We confirm our leading position among the world's 
largest airline groups," Spohr said.
For 2022, Lufthansa is planning to increase its service to around 70 per cent of pre-crisis levels.
During the third - summer - quarter, Lufthansa almost doubled turnover compared to the same quarter last year to 
5.2 billion euros. Despite costs related to reducing staff, the airline booked an operating profit of 17 million euros for 
the quarter, against a loss last year of almost 1.3 billion euros.
Analysts had expected a small loss.
The net loss came in at 72 million euros, contrasted with a net loss of 1.97 billion euros in the third quarter last year.
The company noted a significant increase in new bookings that are now back at 80 per cent of pre-crisis levels. 
Lufthansa Cargo, which came through the pandemic largely unscathed, posted a renewed record with adjusted 
operating profit at 301 million euros.
Lufthansa data shows return to black on stronger summer demand
Lufthansa's budget subsidiary Eurowings posted pre-tax profits of 108 million euros, while Lufthansa Technik, the 
maintenance unit, lifted adjusted pre-tax profits to 155 million euros for the quarter
Catering subsidiary LSG Sky Chefs also posted a profit.
The network airlines - Austrian, Swiss and Brussels - were able to cut their losses by comparison with a year ago.
Lufthansa said that new bookings on its transatlantic routes had returned to around 80 per cent of 2019 levels 
following the announcement of a planned opening of the United States to travellers from Europe from next week.
The airline is continuing to cut staff. At the end of September, it had a total complement of 107,000. German staff 
have been cut this year by 4,000, with a further 3,000 to go.
On Monday, Ryanair, Europe's largest budget carrier, posted operating profits for the third quarter at 245 million 
euros.

Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH, the company which operates an airport some 100 kilometres west of Frankfurt, has filed for 
insolvency, operations manager Christoph Goetzmann told dpa on Tuesday.
Hahn Airport is 82.5-per-cent owned by the Chinese conglomerate HNA. The company acquired the shares from 
the state of Rhineland-Palatinate - where the airport is located - in 2017 for around 15 million euros (17.5 million 
dollars). The remaining 17.5 per cent is held by the state of Hesse.
Most recently, the arrest of the top management of the financially troubled HNA Group caused a stir.
At the time, the airport company emphasized that this would have no effect on Frankfurt-Hahn. The airport was on a 
good course, it said at the beginning of October.
The airport, which was once a US military airport and subsequently a hub for budget carrier Ryanair, has benefited 
from a boom in airfreight resulting from online purchases and bottlenecks in sea freight.
However, even before the coronavirus pandemic hit, passenger traffic had declined from highs of around 4 million a 
year. Dublin-based Ryanair has cut its flights and shifted traffic to larger airports in the region.
In its report for 2020, the airport management acknowledged it would not be making a profit, but predicted that it 
could go into the black by 2024.
Earlier this year, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) threw out an application from Lufthansa targeting the state 
aid that Frankfurt-Hahn had received. The legal action turned on subsidies paid since 1997 and contracts with 
Ryanair on airport fees.

Lukashenko threatened with new EU sanction on re-election anniversary

On the eve of the anniversary of his re-election, widely believed to have been rigged, Belarusian ruler Alexander 
Lukashenko was threatened by the European Union with additional sanctions.
"The EU stands ready to consider further measures in light of the regime's blatant disregard of international 
commitments," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday.
With the "forced and unlawful" landing of a Ryanair flight in May and the instrumentalization of migrants for political 
purposes, the regime has "further challenged international norms," Borrell added.
Borrell was alluding, among other things, to the fact that more than 2,000 illegal crossings were registered at the 
border of EU member Lithuania with Belarus in July alone.
From the EU's point of view, this is being done deliberately by the government in Minsk. Lukashenko had openly 
threatened to allow people from countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria to cross the border in response to the 
EU sanctions.
The EU statement was published on the anniversary of the presidential election in Belarus on August 9 last year. 
Lukashenko was declared the winner with 80.1 per cent of the votes despite massive accusations of electoral fraud.
Mass protests following the elections were put down with violence.
The EU no longer recognizes him as president and has already imposed sanctions in recent months due to the 
repression of civil society and the democratic opposition in Belarus.
Most recently, there were also economic sanctions following the arrest of the anti-government blogger Roman 
Protasevich.
Lukashenko threatened with new EU sanction on re-election anniversary
Authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius in Lithuania to make a 
stopover in Minsk in order to arrest the Lukashenko critic.
Lukashenko's opponent Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claims victory in the August 2020 election, again called for 
greater pressure on Minsk.
"At the moment, nobody can feel safe, including me," the 38-year-old, who now lives in exile in Lithuania, told dpa. 
She mentioned the case of Belarusian activist Vitaly Shishov, who was recently found dead in Ukraine, where he 
lived in exile.
The situation of Belarusian Olympic athlete Kristina Timanovskaya also showed that anyone could be a victim of 
Lukashenko's "repressive apparatus".
The track and field athlete fled to Poland after she said she was to be kidnapped from the Tokyo Olympics for 
criticizing Belarusian sports officials.

German airline Lufthansa is due to report on Thursday on its business in the second quarter, which continued to be 
strongly influenced by the coronavirus pandemic.
Lufthansa planes continue to take off far less frequently and with fewer passengers than before the crisis began.
The continuing ban on EU citizens entering the US is particularly painful. New losses are likely unavoidable for 
Lufthansa in the second quarter.
According to an evaluation by the air safety organization Eurocontrol, Lufthansa was able to increase the number of 
its flights recently, but in the last week of July it was still 46 per cent behind the same week of 2019.
Other airlines such as Ireland's Ryanair, down 17 per cent on the year, or the direct competitor Air France, down 25 
per cent, were already much more present in the skies again.
In the first quarter, the state-backed and highly indebted MDax group had flown in another loss of 1.05 billion euros 
(1.24 billion dollars) after the record loss of 6.7 billion euros in the first coronavirus year 2020.
Chief executive Carsten Spohr and the rest of the management are therefore focused primarily on liquidity, which 
was 10.6 billion euros at the end of March, in part thanks to various tranches of state aid.
According to the company, the main priority of raising 5.5 billion euros of new equity, a move shareholders have 
now approved, is to repay state investments in the company.

Belarusian runner Kristina Timanovskaya is "safe and secure" after an alleged kidnapping attempt, the International 
Olympic Committee (IOC) said Monday.
The country's opposition on Sunday accused Belarusian authorities of trying to kidnap the athlete and force her to 
fly home from the Tokyo Olympics after the 24-year-old criticized Belarusian officials.
Timanovskaya had been due to compete in Monday's 200 metre heats.
IOC spokesman Mark Adams said she had spent Sunday night in a hotel at Tokyo's Haneda airport in a "safe 
environment."
She is now in the hands of authorities and the IOC has asked the Belarusian Olympic Committee for a written report 
on the matter.
IOC representatives spoke to her directly and she assured them she felt safe, Adams said.
On Monday she was photographed entering Poland's embassy in Tokyo, with media reports saying she is seeking 
asylum there and could fly to Warsaw as early as Wednesday.
Poland, as well as the Czech Republic and Slovenia, had offered to help and she has now received a visa from 
Poland.
"Poland will do everything necessary to help her continue her sporting career," deputy foreign minister Marcin 
Przydacz wrote on Twitter.

Olympic officials became aware of her situation after she turned to Japanese police at the airport, Tokyo Olympics 
spokesman Masa Takaya said.
The Belarusian Olympic Committee said in a statement that the runner had been examined by a doctor and would 
not take part in the 200m heats because of her "emotional-psychological condition."
Timanovskaya called that a lie in an Instagram post and told the radio station Euroradio in an interview: "They just 
told me to pack my things and fly home."
Tensions between the international community and Belarus are running high due to the ongoing repression of civil 
society and peaceful protests that were unleashed a year ago after disputed elections, which long-time ruler 
Alexander Lukashenko says he won.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who many in the European Union believe won the election, 
has welcomed the IOC's help with Timanovskaya.
The athletes' plight is the latest international scandal to hit Belarus after the country forced a Ryanair flight to land in 
Minsk in May and arrested an opposition figure.

"She has the free choice to continue her sporting career in Poland if she so chooses," Poland's Deputy Foreign 
Minister Marcin Przydacz said on Twitter.
Tensions between the international community and Belarus are running high due to the ongoing repression of civil 
society and peaceful protests that were unleashed a year ago after disputed elections, which long-time ruler

Belarusian runner Kristina Timanovskaya is "safe and secure" after an alleged kidnapping attempt, the International 
Olympic Committee (IOC) said Monday.
The country's opposition on Sunday accused Belarusian authorities of trying to kidnap the athlete and force her to 
fly home from the Tokyo Olympics after the 24-year-old criticized Belarusian officials.
Timanovskaya had been due to compete in Monday's 200 metre heats.
IOC spokesman Mark Adams said she had spent the night in a hotel at Tokyo's Haneda airport in a "safe 
environment."
She is now in the hands of authorities and the IOC has asked the Belarusian Olympic Committee for a written report 
on the matter.
IOC representatives spoke to her directly during the night and she assured them she felt safe, Adams said.
On Monday she was photographed entering Poland's consulate in Tokyo, with media reports saying she is seeking 
asylum there and could fly to Warsaw as early as Wednesday.
Poland, as well as the Czech Republic, has said it is willing to offer the athlete a humanitarian visa.
"She has the free choice to continue her sporting career in Poland if she so chooses," Poland's Deputy Foreign 
Minister Marcin Przydacz said on Twitter.
Olympic officials became aware of her situation after she turned to Japanese police at the airport, Tokyo Olympics 
spokesman Masa Takaya said.

The international Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected an urgent appeal by Belarusian runner Kristina 
Timanovskaya to be allowed to compete in the 200-metre heats at the Olympic Games on Monday, after her 
exclusion by her country's authorities.
The runner had called on the court to overturn the decision made by the Belarusian Olympic Committee, which 
prevented Timanovskaya from taking part in the race.
However, Timanovskaya's application was turned down on the grounds that she had not been able to prove her 
case, the court said.
Earlier on Monday, the runner was granted a humanitarian visa by Poland's embassy in Tokyo, following what she 
described as an attempted kidnapping to forcibly repatriate her after she criticized Belarusian sports officials.
She was photographed entering Poland's embassy in Tokyo, with media reports saying she was seeking asylum 
there and could fly to Warsaw as early as Wednesday.
Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia had all offered to help.
"Poland will do everything necessary to help her continue her sporting career," deputy foreign minister Marcin 
Przydacz wrote on Twitter.
Olympic officials became aware of Timanovskaya's situation after she turned to Japanese police at the airport, 
Tokyo Olympics spokesman Masa Takaya said.

After court ruling, EU Commission reapproves German aid for Condor
After court ruling, EU Commission reapproves German aid for Condor

The European Commission has approved an updated state bailout package of 525 million euros (618 million 
dollars) for German airline Condor following a court ruling last month that found the previous authorization decision 
lacked necessary detail.
The German plan, comprising loans and aid in the form of debt relief, should compensate the firm for coronavirus-
related damages and help finance a restructuring that will help it get back on solid footing, the EU executive said in 
a press release on Tuesday.
"The aviation sector has been hit particularly hard by the various travel restrictions necessary to contain the spread 
of the coronavirus," EU executive branch vice-president Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said in 
a written statement.
In June, the EU General Court annulled commission decisions from April 2020 approving coronavirus-related state 
aid to Condor: the airline was granted two loans of 550 million euros.
The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to be paid out, the court 
ruled.
Condor managed to avert insolvency last year and left "protective shield" proceedings in December. In May, the 
company found a new investor and a way to hold on the remaining 4,050 jobs.
Budget carrier Ryanair took the commission to court in a slew of cases this year, arguing that its approving a host of 
state aid measures to airlines across Europe distorted competition in the bloc.
The company won certain cases in first instance, for example related to state aid to Dutch KLM and Portuguese 
TAP, but lost others, such as a complaint against aid given to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair.

The Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who were arrested during a 
forced landing of a Ryanair flight, have been transferred to house arrest, his mother and the Belarus' opposition 
leader said on Friday.
Natalia Protasevich, who lives in exile in Poland, told dpa that her daughter, who lives in Minsk, drove to an address 
given to her on Thursday evening where she met her brother and handed him food and clothes.
But the mother said neither the family nor the lawyers have received official updates from Belarusian authorities on 
the status of Roman. Instead, the family is relying on private channels for information.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said Friday that Protasevich and Sapega were now under 
house arrest.
The Russian embassy in Minsk confirmed the house arrest for Sapega, a Russian national. But the authorities in 
the Belarusian capital have yet to comment.
Tikhanovskaya called it "good news"' but added: "House arrest - that is not freedom."
Protasevich and Sapega still faced charges and were "hostages" of the system under Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko, she said.
"We are in contact with Roman's parents - they are not given any information regarding their son, and they have no 
possibility to talk to him themselves. They are convinced that the regime is playing a game, using the lives of 
Roman and Sofia."
Over 500 further prisoners were also currently being held in Belarusian prisons, Tikhanovskaya said.
Jailed Belarusian journalist and girlfriend moved into house arrest
On May 23, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius to stop over 
in Minsk and detained government critic Protasevich and Sapega who were on board.
Strongman Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for around 27 years and is often dubbed "Europe's last dictator," 
has faced criticism for a dangerous encroachment on airspace after the operation, which included a fighter jet.

The European Union imposed its toughest sanctions yet on Belarus on Thursday, taking aim at petroleum and 
tobacco-manufacturing products plus potash - three sectors that the bloc sees as lining the pockets of Alexander 
Lukashenko's government.
Access to EU capital markets is also to be restricted, an EU press release announcing the implementation of the 
measures stated.
EU banks can no longer sell insurance or re-insurance to Belarusian government or public bodies, according to the 
press release, and the European Investment Bank is to stop transferring funds to public sector projects. Trading in 
certain surveillance technology or software to anyone in Belarus is also prohibited.
EU foreign ministers signed off on the move earlier this week. 
It is the bloc's latest response to Belarusian authorities' ongoing crackdown on pro-democratic forces following a 
contested August 2020 election, as well as the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to detain a government critic and 
his girlfriend last month.
The EU already adopted several packages of sanctions targeting Lukashenko's supporters last year, as well as the 
president himself.
Then, shortly after the flight incident, the bloc sealed off its airspace to carriers from its eastern neighbour.
The 66-year-old Lukashenko has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states 
Poland, Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.

EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday to slap their toughest punitive measures yet on Belarus, a package of 
economic sanctions targeting sectors that benefit the government of President Alexander Lukashenko.
The agreement, struck at a meeting in Luxembourg and confirmed to dpa by two diplomatic sources, follows weeks 
of tough negotiations over which economic actors to hit.
Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said a total of seven cash cow areas will be hit, including tobacco, 
potash - a potassium-rich salt used in fertilizer - petroleum products and financial services.
"I think these are sanctions that will hurt. And I hope they hurt so much that they bring the regime to its knees," 
Asselborn told journalists before the meeting.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the move would "contribute to financially drying out the regime."
It is the bloc's latest response to the forced landing of a Ryanair flight and the arrest of a Belarusian dissident 
blogger last month. The EU already sealed off its airspace to carriers from its eastern neighbour.
The punitive measures - which aim to tighten the vice on the authoritarian government of Lukashenko and 
strengthen his opponents - must still be formally adopted, but their basic remit is now fixed.
However, it is unclear exactly they will be implemented, according to Asselborn. "We need a bit of time to translate 
this into reality."
The bloc is also set to blacklist dozens more individuals or organizations that support Lukashenko on Monday, 
adding to the close to 90 targets already subject EU travel bans or asset freezes.
EU ministers agree on major Belarusian economic sanctions package
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has been calling for tough EU measures, also spoke 
with the ministers in Luxembourg.
"Sanctions aren't a silver bullet, but they can help to end violence and release people," she tweeted.
Tikhanovskaya currently lives in exile in Lithuania. She is considered by many to be the winner of the disputed 
presidential election of August 9, 2020, after which Lukashenko had himself proclaimed president again.
The EU no longer recognizes him as head of state and claims the poll was neither nor fair.
The bloc has been calling for the release of Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, both of whom were 
detained after being hauled off the Vilnius-bound Ryanair flight, along with hundreds of political prisoners.
Most of the targets to be added to the EU blacklist immediately on Monday are accused of helping to repress 
demonstrators, opposition figures or journalists, but others were chosen for a link to the flight diversion.
Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU already adopted several packages 
of sanctions targeting Lukashenko's supporters last year, as well as the president himself.
UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet voiced concern on Monday about a continued deterioration in 
the country highlighting "severe restrictions" to freedom of expression and assembly, worrisome raids on civil 
society and media and judicial persecution of activists and journalists.
"We continue to receive numerous allegations of arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and ill-treatment," she said 
in a statement.
The 66-year-old Lukashenko has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states 
Poland, Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
Minsk has grown closer to Moscow in recent years. But Lukashenko has also maintained relations with EU partners 
in his almost 27 years in power.

EU foreign ministers have resolved to impose their toughest punitive measures yet on Belarus, a package of 
economic sanctions targeting sectors that benefit the government of President Alexander Lukashenko.
The bloc's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, announced the decision following a Monday meeting in Luxembourg, and 
said he believed they would "put pressure" on Lukashenko. "Certainly, we believe we can influence behaviour."
Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said a total of seven cash cow areas will be hit, including tobacco, 
potash - a potassium-rich salt used in fertilizer - petroleum products and financial services.
It is the bloc's latest response to Belarusian authorities ongoing crackdown on pro-democratic forces. Tensions 
have spiked further since the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to detain a government critic and his girlfriend last 
month. The EU already sealed off its airspace to carriers from its eastern neighbour.
"We want the end of violence against protesters and opposition figures and an inclusive dialogue that ultimately 
leads to free and fair elections," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters.
The new measures - which aim to tighten the vice on the authoritarian government of Lukashenko and strengthen 
his opponents - must still be formally adopted, but their basic remit is now fixed.
It is unclear exactly when they will be implemented.
The bloc also imposed fresh sanctions on high-ranking officials and key companies on Monday, coordinating a 
package of measures along with the United States, Canada and Britain.
In total, the EU added 78 individual names to its Belarus blacklist, plus eight institutions or organizations, taking the 
total to 166 persons and 15 entities.
EU settles on economic sanctions to squeeze Belarusian leader
Among the companies affected - according to the entry published in the official EU legal journal - is state-owned 
company BelAZ - one of the biggest manufacturers of large trucks and dumper trucks in the world.
The list also includes the company responsible for controlling air traffic over Belarus.Lukashenko's son Dmitry, 
Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin, other members of the government, and a number of judges are targeted too.In a 
separate statement, London said it had sanctioned, together with the other parties, senior-ranking Belarusian 
officials plus the British-based company BNK, which exports Belarusian oil products.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has been calling for tough EU measures, also met with 
the foreign ministers.
"It's impossible that nothing will change after these sanctions," she told journalists in Brussels.
Tikhanovskaya currently lives in exile in Lithuania. She is considered by many to be the winner of the disputed 
presidential election of August 9, 2020, after which Lukashenko had himself proclaimed president again.
The EU no longer recognizes him as head of state and claims the poll was neither nor fair.
The underlying aim of EU punitive measures is to try and force fresh elections in Belarus.
"They have to understand that there is no other way out," Tikhanovskaya said at a Brussels press conference.
Most of the targets added to the EU blacklist on Monday are accused of helping to repress demonstrators, 
opposition figures or journalists, but others were chosen for a link to the diverted Ryanair flight.
Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU already adopted several packages

EU foreign ministers meeting Monday in Luxembourg are set to blacklist dozens more supporters of Belarusian 
President Alexander Lukashenko in a bid to tighten the vice on his government and strengthen its opponents.
Seventy-eight individuals are to be hit with measures like EU travel bans or having assets located in the bloc frozen, 
EU sources told dpa last week. At least seven entities such as state institutions or companies are also to be 
targeted, according to the same sources.
The 27 ministers are also to discuss a larger, harder-hitting set of economic sanctions taking aim at cash cow 
sectors. An EU diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said they expect the ministers to come to a "clear 
political agreement" on what these should cover.
Options floated so far have included potash - a potassium-rich salt used to make fertilizer - oil products and 
financial services.
But these won't be ready to implement on Monday, a senior EU official said.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has called for tough EU measures, is also to speak with 
the ministers in Luxembourg.
Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU has already sanctioned close to 90 
people, including the president himself.
There have been mass protests against Lukashenko ever since an August 2020 presidential election that the EU 
believes was neither free nor fair.

Last month, Belarusian authorities diverted a Ryanair flight and arrested the government critic Roman Protasevich 
and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
As a result, Belarusian airlines are banned from EU airspace as of early June.
Most of the targets in the sanctions package to be adopted on Monday are accused of helping to repress 
demonstrators, opposition figures or journalists, but others were chosen for a link to the flight diversion.

Three weeks after his arrest, the Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich made another public 
appearance on Monday, although many fear he is being forced to speak under duress.
"I feel great," Protasevich said at a surprise press conference in Minsk. "Nobody has beat me or even touched me," 
the 26-year-old said, laughing and seeming relaxed at the Foreign Ministry-organized event.
Protasevich also addressed his parents, who have been appealing to world leaders for his release and expressing 
fears over his treatment: "Mum, dad, don't worry, everything is fine with me."
Protasevich said while he did not support long-time ruler Alexander Lukashenko, "I respect him as a person."
A journalist who was at the press conference echoed the sentiment of many observers, including Protasevich's 
parents, that she didn't believe one word he was saying.
In the days after his arrest, Protasevich gave an interview to state TV in which he seemed distressed and made 
what appeared to be a coerced confession to instigating mass anti-government protests.
In an incident that sparked international outrage almost three weeks ago, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair 
passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius to stop over in Minsk.
Government critic Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who were on board the plane, were taken into 
custody at the airport.
On Monday, a court in Minsk dismissed a complaint by Sapega against her detention, the Russian news agency 
TASS reported.
Her lawyers have announced an appeal of the decision, arguing that Belarus was bound by international law to let 
air travellers reach their destination.

The mother of Roman Protasevich, a government critic imprisoned in Belarus, has asked German Chancellor 
Angela Merkel to help secure the release of her son and other prisoners in the country.
"We ask you very much to help us so that all innocent people are released from prison," Natalia Protasevich told the 
Bild newspaper on Saturday.
"They need urgent help because they are exposed to sadism and violence every day," she said.
She called for Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko, who has faced protests since a disputed election last 
year, to be stopped.
"Every more day, no, every more hour that passes costs innocent people, including children, their lives," she said.
Almost three weeks ago, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius 
to stop over in Minsk and detained government critic Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega who were 
on board.
The EU then reimposed sanctions against the former Soviet republic.
The blogger's father, Dmitri Protasevich, told Bild that their letters would not be delivered to their son. "Even his 
lawyer cannot talk to us freely on the phone," he said.
"Instead, two videos have already been released by the state in which forced confessions are made." In these, he 
said, one can see clear signs of torture.
One of these signs was bruises on his neck. "An expert told us that these were strangulation marks," he said.
Protasevich's parents live in exile in Poland.

Following the forced landing of a plane travelling between two EU capitals and the arrest of blogger Roman 
Protasevich in Belarus, the European Parliament has called for further sanctions on the hardline regime in Minsk.
Punitive measures should be taken against the crude oil-processing industry, the production of petroleum products, 
and the potash, steel and wood-processing industries, it said in a resolution adopted on Thursday.
In addition, cooperation with state-owned Belarusian banks should be stopped. Consideration should also be given 
to temporarily excluding Belarus from the Swift payment system.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign affairs commissioner, said during Tuesday's plenary debate that he hoped EU 
member states would adopt further punitive measures on Belarus at the next summit. For the first time, targeted 
economic sanctions had been agreed upon.
Almost three weeks ago, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius 
to make a stopover in Minsk and arrested the government critic Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega on

Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU had already adopted several 
packages of sanctions targeting President Alexander Lukashenko's supporters last year.
Russia's possible role in the case should be investigated and, if necessary, sanctions imposed on those 
responsible, they said.

Budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday won an EU court case against German state aid given to its competitor 
Condor.
The General Court of the EU court annulled the European Commission's decisions approving coronavirus-related 
state aid to Condor: the airline was granted two loans of 550 million euros (760 million dollars) last year.
The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to be paid out, the court 
ruled on Wednesday.
However, the effects of the annulment - including the order to pay back the aid - are suspended until the 
commission submits a new decision.
Effectively, this means that the EU General Court's judges are giving the commission a chance to issue a more 
detailed decision. It therefore annulled the commission's decision.
Ryanair has taken the commission to court in a slew of cases, arguing that its approving a host of state aid 
measures to airlines across Europe distorted competition in the bloc.
While it won certain cases in first instance, for example related to state aid to Dutch KLM and Portuguese TAP, it 
lost others, such as a complaint against aid given to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair.

Lithuania's defences need to be bolstered in light of the rising threat posed by neighbouring Belarus, President 
Gitanas Nauseda said on Tuesday, less than a week before a NATO summit.
"Beyond Lithuania's eastern borders there is an unstable space where inherent human rights and the rules of the 
free world are disrespected, where dictators ... step into the role of terrorists and hijack passenger planes. Where 
border and nuclear security becomes a tool of blackmail," said the EU and NATO country's leader.
Belarus' long-time leader, Alexander Lukashenko, re-inflammed tensions with the EU last month after a Ryanair 
passenger flight from Athens to Vilnius was forced to land in Minsk and an opposition journalist and his partner 
were taken into custody. Leaders in the West had described it as a "state hijacking."
It's been nearly a year since Belarus hit the headlines following presidential elections in August that spurred 
protests against Lukashenko, who claimed victory. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, whom the opposition claims as the 
true winner, is in exile in Lithuania.
Lukashenko's latest threat is to allow migrants to move through his country on their way to the EU. Lithuania has a 
nearly 680-kilometre border with Belarus, which is part of the EU's external border.
The government in Vilnius reported a sharp increase in illegal border crossings by migrants the previous week. 
Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite suspected a targeted action by the leadership in Minsk.
A controversial Belarusian nuclear power plant only about 50 kilometres from the Lithuanian capital also weighs on 
relations.

The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, in a break with usual diplomatic practice, called Belarusian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko "a dictator" in the European Parliament on Tuesday.
"I agree with all of you, we are facing a dictator," Borrell told parliamentarians during a plenary debate in 
Strasbourg. He also stressed the need to continue exerting pressure on Lukashenko.
The European Union has adopted several sanctions packages against Lukashenko and his supporters, most 
recently over the forced landing in Minsk of a Ryanair passenger flight between Athens and Vilnius and subsequent 
arrest of a dissident journalist and his partner.
Belarusian airlines have in response not been allowed to fly into European Union airspace since the weekend.
The Minsk government's attempts to suppress ongoing protests in the former Soviet republic had earlier led the 
bloc to sanctions.
Less than a week before a NATO summit, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Tuesday his country's 
defences need to be bolstered in light of the rising threat posed by neighbouring Belarus.

Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was introduced by the head of the Czech Senate as 
the "elected president of Belarus" during a visit to Prague on Monday.
In his remarks, Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil denounced Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko for 
refusing to give up power following August's presidential election, which was slammed by the European Union, the 
United States and others as marred by fraud, repression and state violence.
The elections in the authoritarian country were "unfree, unfair, unjust and illegitimate," Vystrcil said.
The opposition believes Tikhanovskaya, 38, was the true winner in August, which prompted them to organize 
months of mass protests that were met by a fierce police crackdown and widespread arrests. Tikhanovskaya fled to 
neighbouring Lithuania.
Tikhanovskaya thanked the Czech Republic for its support in, among other things, providing medical treatment to 
supporters of the Belarusian opposition.
Tikhanovskaya once again condemned the arrest of activist journalist Roman Protasevich, whose Ryanair plane 
was forced to land in Minsk two weeks ago so that he could be taken into custody along with girlfriend, Sofia 
Sapega.
The incident threw the plight of the Belarus' opposition back into the spotlight.
No one can still be in doubt that the Belarusian leadership are "terrorists" and must be ousted, Tikhanovskaya said. 
A new wave of protests was being prepared, she added.
Her agenda also includes meetings with Prime Minister Andrej Babis, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhanek and 
President Milos Zeman.

Tikhanovskaya has been trying to get EU states to put greater pressure on Lukashenko to enter into a dialogue with

European Council President Charles Michel accused Moscow of "illegal, provocative and disruptive activities 
against the European Union, its member states and others" in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin 
on Monday.
"EU-Russia relations are at a low," an EU press release outlining Michel's message to Putin stated. "This situation 
or its further deterioration is in neither side's interest."
Relations between Moscow and Brussels have long been strained. The EU imposed sanctions on Moscow following 
both the imprisonment of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny and the annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 
Ukraine. Moscow responded with countermeasures.
According to the statement, Michel - one of the bloc's most senior officials - raised the issue of Ukraine and also of 
Belarus, an increasingly close ally of Moscow and also the subject of recent EU sanctions.
Michel "reiterated the EU's assessment of the forced landing of the Ryanair flight by the Belarusian authorities," the 
press release continued, referring to an incident last month that triggered the introduction of an EU flight ban for 
Belarusian airlines.
Belarus must release political prisoners and stop domestic repression, Michel said, repeating previous EU 
statements.
"Russia can play an important role in supporting a peaceful settlement of the crisis," he urged.
EU leaders are in the process of reviewing their joint policy towards Russia, with the next debate set for a summit 
later this month.

NATO's head has warned Russia and Belarus against threatening the alliance's allies, following the forced landing 
of a passenger plane within the EU by Belarusian authorities, in comments published on Sunday.
"We are of course ready, in an emergency, to protect and defend any ally against any kind of threat coming from 
Minsk and Moscow," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
"We are vigilant and we are following what is happening in Belarus very closely," he said.
Belarus is becoming "more and more dependent" on Russia, he added.
Stoltenberg said NATO was seriously concerned about the closer cooperation between Moscow and Minsk in 
recent months. "We have had to learn in the past that Russia has massively violated the territorial integrity of states 
such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova," he said.
He did not want to speculate too much, Stoltenberg said, noting, "NATO is a defensive alliance."
Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, all members of NATO, share borders with Belarus.
Two weeks ago, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko forced a Ryanair commercial flight between two 
EU capitals, Athens and Vilnius, to make an emergency landing in Minsk.
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, passengers on the plane, were arrested 
and are being held in custody.
While the EU responded with sanctions on Belarus, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Lukashenko for talks 
and said Moscow would support Belarus with 500 million dollars in credit.
Putin also underlined his continuing support for Lukashenko in his confrontation with the West.

Belarusian political scientist Artyom Shraibman, who was named by the dissident journalist detained after the forced 
landing of a passenger flight in Minsk, announced on Saturday that he has fled the country out of fear of also being 
imprisoned.
The journalist, 26-year-old Roman Protasevich, had said in an interview aired on Belarusian state media on 
Thursday, which was likely conducted under duress, that he had worked for the opposition abroad and gave names 
of several people he said were also involved.
However, Shraibman - one of those named - said that he had not worked for the Belarusian opposition and was 
only an observer and analyst.
He added that he saw Protasevich as a "hostage" taken by President Alexander Lukashenko and thus could not 
condemn him for the accusations. State media celebrated the news of Shraibman's "escape."
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who is also in exile, described Protasevich's interview as the 
result of torture and met with the journalist's parents in Poland on Saturday.
She has repeatedly called for the release of all political prisoners.
As of midnight on Saturday, the European Union is to seal off its skies and runways to Belarusian airlines in 
response to the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight and the detention of Protasevich.
Even before the sanctions decision, all airlines based in the bloc had been asked to avoid flights into Belarusian 
airspace.
Air travellers will probably only be able to reach Belarus now through detours, for example via Russia.

In Belarus, state television has shown a long interview with imprisoned government critic Roman Protasevich for the 
first time.
In the interview with the broadcaster ONT, which was aired on Thursday evening, the 26-year-old blogger admitted 
to having organized protests against strongman ruler Alexander Lukashenko. At the same time, he said that he 
admired Lukashenko.
His mother Natalia Protasevich, who lives in Poland, described the interview on Friday as the result of torture in 
prison.
"I can't even imagine the torture methods - both psychological and physical - that my son is being subjected to at 
the moment," the 46-year-old told dpa. "You probably can't suffer a greater torture as a mother."
In the one-and-a-half-hour conversation, Protasevich also made accusations against other members of the 
Belarusian opposition, sometimes in a trembling voice.
Protasevich's parents had already expressed the suspicion that their son was being mistreated in prison and forced 
to make statements.
Lukashenko had forced a passenger plane to reroute and land in Minsk almost a fortnight ago and had Protasevich 
and his girlfriend arrested.
The incident - involving a Ryanair commercial flight between the two EU capitals of Athens and Vilnius - has 
intensified the conflict between the former Soviet republic and the West. The EU and the US imposed new 
sanctions on Belarus as a result.

A long interview on Belarusian TV with imprisoned government critic Roman Protasevich has provoked an angry 
reaction from several European countries.
In the interview with the broadcaster ONT, which was aired on Thursday evening, the 26-year-old blogger admitted 
to having organized protests against strongman ruler Alexander Lukashenko. At the same time, he said that he 
admired Lukashenko.
German government spokesman Steffen Seibert described it as "a completely undignified and implausible 
confession interview" that was probably obtained under psychological and physical duress.
"Mr Protasevich's disturbing interview last night was clearly under duress and in detention," British Foreign 
Secretary Dominic Raab wrote on Twitter.
"Those involved in the filming, coercion and direction of the interview must be held accountable," he said.
Protasevich and his girlfriend were arrested in Minsk a fortnight ago after Lukashenko forced a passenger plane to 
reroute and land in the Belarusian capital.
The incident - involving a Ryanair commercial flight between the two EU capitals of Athens and Vilnius - has 
intensified the conflict between the former Soviet republic and the West.
The EU and the US imposed fresh sanctions on Belarus as a result; some sanctions had already been in place 
since elections last year that have been discredited by many countries.
Moscow has however stood by Minsk in the dispute.
Appalled response as Belarus shows interview with imprisoned blogger
Protasevich's mother Natalia Protasevich, who lives in Poland, described the interview on Friday as the result of 
torture in prison.
"I can't even imagine the torture methods - both psychological and physical - that my son is being subjected to at 
the moment," the 46-year-old told dpa. "You probably can't suffer a greater torture as a mother."
She pointed to her son's wrists which she said showed dark spots and inflammation.
The blogger's mother called for independent doctors to be allowed to examine her son. "They should also do blood 
analysis of what he is being injected with." Protasevich's lawyer had been denied access to him this week, she said.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, referring to the interview, said Protasevich was surely 
tortured and the international community should not pay heed to such extorted statements.
"All such videos are done under pressure," Tikhanovskaya said at a press conference in Warsaw on Friday. 
"[Through using violence] you can make a person say whatever you want."
When a person is in a political prison, the aim is to survive: "We don't have to pay attention" to such statements, the 
Belarusian opposition leader said.
In the one-and-a-half-hour conversation, Protasevich also made accusations against other members of the 
Belarusian opposition, sometimes in a trembling voice.
The European Union is to seal off its skies and runways to Belarusian airlines as of Saturday in response to the 
forced diversion of Protasevich's flight.
EU ambassadors kicked off the necessary written legal procedure to implement the move on Friday, diplomatic 
sources told dpa, with completion considered a formality.

The European Union will seal off its skies and runways to Belarusian airlines as of Saturday in response to the 
forced diversion of a Ryanair flight and detention of a dissident journalist and his girlfriend last month.
The 27 countries are obliged "to deny permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories to any aircraft 
operated by Belarusian air carriers," the bloc announced on Friday after member states envoys in Brussels formally 
signed off the move.
Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega were on board a commercial flight between EU 
countries Greece and Lithuania that was rerouted to Minsk shortly before it reached Vilnius due to an alleged bomb 
threat. No bomb was found, but both were detained.
The bloc slammed the act as an affront to both air safety and freedom of the press.
The EU has also called on all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarusian territory.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) condemned Minsk's behaviour but also criticized the EU.
"Two wrongs do not make a right. Politics should never interfere with the safe operation of aircraft and politicians 
should never use aviation safety as a cover to pursue political or diplomatic agendas," Willie Walsh, IATA's director 
general, said in a statement.
The bloc is also preparing a package of economic sanctions on individuals involved in the incident, but this could 
still take some time to finalize, according to dpa's diplomatic sources.

countries Greece and Lithuania that was rerouted to Minsk shortly before it reached Vilnius due to an alleged bomb 
threat. No bomb was found, but both were detained.
The bloc slammed the move as an affront to both air safety and freedom of the press.On May 24, EU leaders 
agreed to block access to their country's airspace and airports, and also called on all EU-based carriers to avoid 
flying over Belarusian territory.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) condemned Minsk's behaviour but 
also criticized the EU move in a statement.
"Two wrongs do not make a right. Politics should never interfere with the safe operation of aircraft and politicians 
should never use aviation safety as a cover to pursue political or diplomatic agendas," Willie Walsh, IATA's director 
general, said.
The bloc is also preparing a package of economic sanctions on individuals involved in the incident, but this could 
still take some to finalize, according to dpa's diplomatic sources.

Russian court jails activist Pivovarov for two months pending trial
Russian court jails activist Pivovarov for two months pending trial

A court in southern Russia ruled on Wednesday that prominent dissident Andrei Pivovarov should be kept in 
custody for two months pending trial.
The court in Krasnodar said the 39-year-old, who until recently led the group Open Russia, was being investigated 
for involvement in an "undesirable organization."
The designation was given to Open Russia, which had been openly critical of the Kremlin, just days ago.
Pivovarov was detained Monday evening while attempting to leave for Poland.
He was taken off a flight operated by Poland's LOT airline before departure in St Petersburg. Police officers had 
stopped the plane, which was already taxiing down the runway, Pivovarov wrote on his Telegram channel.
He was then transferred to the southern city of Krasnodar because, his lawyer explained, Pivovarov had published 
several Facebook posts from Krasnodar about a year ago and they were now being investigated.
The European Union and Amnesty International called for Pivovarov's immediate release.
Polish officials, meanwhile, criticized Russia for the action taken on board one of its planes.
"This is clearly an unacceptable situation," Polish government spokesperson Piotr Mueller told public radio 
broadcaster Polskie Radio on Wednesday.
Pawel Mucha, advisor to Polish President Andrzej Duda, said that Poland's civil aviation authority will analyse the 
data from the flight in question, provided by LOT airline, and that "appropriate and adequate" reactions will be taken 
on the basis of international and aviation law.

If found guilty, Pivovarov may face up to six years in prison.
Pivovarov had announced he would disband Open Russia, which has also been supported by Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky, a powerful critic of President Vladimir Putin, after it was deemed an "undesirable organization."
The fact that he was still detained anyway was a sign of "complete lawlessness," wrote Pivovarov.
Pivarov's lawyer linked the imprisonment to her client's intention to run in the parliamentary elections in September. 
That had scared Putin's United Russia party, Tatyana Usmanova said.
"You don't love Putin? Then they'll poison you, lock you up and torture you in prison," wrote the team of well-known 
imprisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who narrowly survived a poison attack last year.
Navalny, who is being held in a prison camp, expressed solidarity with Pivovarov and other detained opposition 
figures. "These are honest people who are being persecuted precisely for this," Navalny wrote on Instagram.
Khodorkovsky's team said Pivovarov had been taken off the plane "Belarusian style," referring to last month's 
forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk so that authoritarian ruler Alexander Lukashenko could jail one his 
opponents, the activist journalist Roman Protasevich.

Flight approval dispute briefly halts German - Russian air traffic
Flight approval dispute briefly halts German-Russian air traffic

Air traffic between Germany and Russia was briefly disrupted on Wednesday due to a dispute over flight approvals 
that left passengers stranded.
The two sides started locking horns on Wednesday morning, when two Lufthansa flights departing from Frankfurt 
had to be scrapped because Russian authorities had failed to issue the necessary permits.
In response, the German Federal Aviation Office said it would not issue any further permits for incoming flights by 
Russian airlines until the Russian authorities had approved flights from Germany.
Consequently, flights by Russian airlines Aeroflot and S7 could not take place on Wednesday.
The quarrel appeared to be resolved by Wednesday evening, when German carrier Lufthansa said it had received 
permission to land in Moscow and St Petersburg for the entire month of June.
The Transport Ministry in Berlin confirmed that permission had been granted to Lufthansa and so Russian airlines 
were once again allowed to land in Germany.
According to ministry sources, the row has its origins in March 2020.
At that time, Russia unilaterally suspended bilateral flight agreements due to the coronavirus pandemic.
As a result, the overall number of flights were reduced and the journeys had to be approved on a monthly basis.
But other tensions over flights erupted in the wake of last month's forced diversion to Belarus of a Ryanair plane, 
which was travelling from Greece to Lithuania.
Flight approval dispute briefly halts German - Russian air traffic
Once at the airport in Minsk, Belarusian activist journalist Roman Protasevich was taken into custody along with his 
girlfriend.
The incident was described as a "state hijacking" by Greece and led to widespread outrage at Belarus' long-time 
authoritarian ruler Alexander Lukaschenko, who is backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The European Union urged airlines based in the bloc to avoid Belarus airspace. That led air carriers to draw up 
revised flight paths to Russia, but in some cases Russia denied the new applications, including for Air France and 
Austrian Airlines.
The Russian aviation authority said that it could not keep pace with the large number of such applications that 
needed to be processed, leading to the cancellations.

German police examined a Ryanair passenger jet on the tarmac at Berlin Airport for several hours late on Sunday 
after an unscheduled landing, police confirmed.
Why the plane en route from Dublin to Cracow stopped in Berlin around 8 pm (1800 GMT) was not immediately 
disclosed for operational reasons, a police spokesperson said.
The aircraft was taken to a parking spot away from the terminal. The 160 passengers were taken inside.
The jet was surrounded by numerous police vehicles with flashing lights.
Police aided by sniffer dogs examined the passengers' luggage assembled near the plane. The luggage was taken 
inside the terminal building later.
The police search operation went on into the early hours of Monday with no end in sight.
It was unclear if and when the plane would be allowed to resume its journey.
Airport authorities lifted the night flight ban for the Ryanair flight as a precaution.
The Berlin tabloids B.Z. and Bild had first reported on the incident and mentioned a potential bomb scare.
Last summer, a Ryanair plane had to make a safety landing on its way from Dublin to Krakow because of an 
anonymous bomb threat. Irish media reported that nothing was found during the search in London Stansted.
Sunday's incident in Berlin comes a week after Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force another 
Ryanair flight to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who was on board was then arrested.

A Ryanair plane made an unscheduled landing in Berlin due to information received about a possible security threat 
on board, the Irish airline said on Monday.
The flight from the Irish capital Dublin to Krakow in Poland was diverted to the German capital around 8 pm (1800 
GMT) on Sunday because that was the closest airport, the company said.
The Boeing 737-800 was met by a group of police vehicles with lights flashing as it parked in a spot away from the 
main terminal.
The 165 passengers and their luggage were taken off the plane and examined with the help of sniffer dogs, in an 
operation that lasted until 4 am.
After eight hours, passengers then continued on with their journey using a replacement aircraft.
German federal police said on Monday morning they had determined there was no danger to the aircraft but have 
yet to release details on the purported threat, saying only that it was a telephone call that had raised alarm.
German tabloids Bild and BZ said that there had been a bomb threat, but neither the police nor Ryanair confirmed 
those reports.
Sunday's incident in Berlin comes a week after Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force another 
Ryanair flight to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who was on board was then arrested along with his

NATO is to more strictly control access to its headquarters in the Belgian capital for Belarusian officials, according 
the alliance's secretary general, in the wake of a forced Ryanair flight diversion that stoked international outrage.
"We have decided to restrict the access of Belarusian personnel to the NATO headquarters based on our 
assessment of security measures," defence alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday.
The decision comes after the forced rerouting to Minsk of a passenger jet travelling between two NATO member 
countries - Greece and Lithuania - earlier this month in order to detain a dissident Belarusian journalist and his 
girlfriend.
NATO's 30 member states condemned the move and called for the immediate release of Roman Protasevich and 
Sofia Sapega in a joint statement last week.
Minsk's envoy in Brussels is Aleksandr Mikhnevich, who represents the former Soviet republic - bordering 
several EU states and Russia - at both NATO and the European Union.
Belarus has participated in NATO partnership programmes since the 1990s. However, in view of the government's 
crackdown on political opposition, relations with Minsk have been strained for years.

Russia is to support Belarus with 500 million dollars in credit over the coming weeks, the leaders of the two 
countries have agreed.
During a meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko agreed the 
sum would be paid out by the end of June, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, according to 
news agency Interfax.
This is the second tranche of a credit package that was agreed before the controversial forced landing of a 
passenger aeroplane in Minsk last Sunday in order to arrest a dissident blogger, Roman Protasevich, and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
During their meeting in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, Putin and Lukashenko spoke about trade and economic 
cooperation, Peskov said.
Belarus' economy is weak, and it has already borrowed billions of dollars from Moscow.
During the opening of the meeting on Friday, both leaders complained about pressure from Western countries on 
Belarus.
After the incident with the plane - a Ryanair commercial flight between the two EU capitals of Athens and Vilnius 
that was forced to reroute and land in Minsk - the European Union and the United States imposed fresh sanctions 
on Belarus, which the Kremlin slammed as an emotional reaction.
Peskov emphasized that the fate of Sapega, who is a Russian national, mattered to the Russian authorities, but 
said the 23-year-old had a residency permit in Belarus.

Meanwhile the president of the EU Parliament, David Sassoli, said he wants to keep up pressure Belarus in order 
secure the release of the blogger and his girlfriend.
Sassoli suggested that photos of Protassevich be exhibited at all airports in the EU and in the European Parliament.
"We will keep the attention and the pressure up and hope that this will lead to the release of Roman Protasevich 
and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega," he said in remarks to Germany's Funke media group.
Sassoli called the EU's initial reaction to the forced landing of a passenger jet in Minsk as "strong and unified."

Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya called for the world to stand with political prisoners on the 
one-year anniversary of her husband's jailing.
From her exile in Lithuania, Tikhanovskaya urged rallies to take place and once again demanded that Roman 
Protasevich, an opposition journalist and vocal critic of the Belarusian regime, be released.
Protasevich was arrested in Belarus after being taken off a diverted Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania nearly a 
week ago.
The incident triggered international condemnation and put the spotlight once again on the plight of journalists and 
activists in the authoritarian Eastern European country.
Tikhanovskaya's husband Sergei had wanted to run against long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko in the 
presidential election held in August, but was arrested at the end of last May. He faces years in prison.
His wife ran in his place. According to the official results, she lost the election, which was widely regarded as rigged.
The country's pro-democracy movement, however, sees her as the true winner and for weeks stage mass post-
election rallies, often resulting in hundreds of people detained. Tikhanovskaya fled to Lithuania for her safety.
The United States and the European Union no longer recognize Lukashenko as president and said they will impose 
sanctions in the wake of Protasevich's plane arrest.
Protasevich's girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, was also taken into custody after the Ryanair plane was forced to land in 
Minsk.

One of Belarus' most famous entrepreneurs is willing to pull together top dollar for an important job, but anyone 
hoping to cash in has to be willing to put Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko behind bars.
Valeri Tsepkalo campaigned for the presidency in last year's elections, but fled Belarus before the polls after he 
grew concerned for his safety.
Now he's released a video on YouTube stating his intent to raise 11 million euros (13.4 million dollars) in a 
crowdfunding venture.
The money would be given to any member or members of the security forces who ensure that Lukashenko is put 
behind bars.
As of Friday, the effort has raised 60,000 euros.
But Tsepkalo says he's optimistic the gambit will work, arguing that there are still upstanding people in power in 
Belarus who are not willing to cooperate any longer with "criminal number one," as he calls Lukashenko.
Tsepkalo is one of many who have accused Lukashenko of fixing the election last year, as well as charges of 
murder and kidnapping.
Multiple sanctions have been slapped on the country since the widely panned elections, which the European Union 
and other democracies have failed to recognize.
Tensions with Belarus have ratcheted up after a Ryanair flight heading from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land 
in Minsk at the weekend because of an alleged bomb on board.
No bomb was found, but Belarusian authorities took advantage of the situation to arrest dissident blogger Roman 
Protasevich.

The European Commission has suggested providing 3 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) to Minsk "once Belarus 
embarks on a democratic transition," it announced, five days after a dissident was arrested when his commercial 
flight was forced to land.
The proposal, which EU countries still have to assess, should be seen as the bloc's commitment "to support the 
Belarusian people's wishes for a peaceful democratic transition in the country," according to a press release.
Belarus has been rocked by protests following the disputed presidential election in August last year, in which long-
term leader Alexander Lukashenko claims victory. The EU considers the elections neither free nor fair.
Relations between the EU and Belarus soured further over the weekend when Belarusian authorities forced a 
Ryanair flight, heading from Athens to Vilnius, to land in Minsk, and arrested a journalist and his girlfriend who were 
on board.
"It should be a genuine incentive for the regime to change its course," EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said. 
"The EU remains truly committed to a democratic Belarus."
The money would be distributed in the form of grants and loans. It would be used to stabilize the country's economy 
and create jobs, as well as to "reform its institutions to make them more democratic," the press release said.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc supported democratic change in the country.
"When - and we believe it is a case of when, not if - Belarus starts its peaceful democratic transition, the EU will be 
there to accompany it," she said in a press release.

Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who's under increasing pressure from the West and EU sanctions, is 
heading to Russia on Friday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The two leaders will discuss further developing their countries' ties when they get together in the Black Sea resort of 
Sochi, according to the Kremlin. Friday's meeting will be the third between the two leaders already this year.
Lukashenko says that he will also discuss the consequences of EU and US sanctions, which are currently hitting 
Belarus especially hard.
Minsk already owes Moscow billions, but Putin has recently repeatedly emphasized that the Kremlin would continue

The meeting is taking place less than a week after Belarus forced a passenger plane to make an emergency

a fighter jet to accompany the Ryanair flight.
Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old dissident journalist, and his partner were taken into custody after the landing, 
prompting a raft of measures by the EU, including restricted access to the bloc's airspace for Belarusian carriers.
It was unclear on Friday whether airlines that were following the EU's recommendation were being blocked from 
landing in Russia.
Some airlines, such as Air France, reportedly had to cancel flights after alternative routes that avoided Belarus were 
not approved.

Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko complained to Russian President Vladimir Putin about increasing 
pressure from the West and EU sanctions during talks held in Sochi on Friday.
After a dissident's commercial flight between two EU capitals - Athens and Vilnius - was forced to reroute and land 
in Minsk, Brussels imposed sanctions that penalized state-owned airline Belavia, although it had nothing to do with 
the incident, Lukashenko said.
Regime critic Roman Protasevich was detained after landing in Minsk, sparking international condemnation.
At the leaders' meeting, Putin criticized an incident in 2013 when the Bolivian president's plane was diverted, 
without the EU's objections in what he called a US operation.
Lukashenko said he could prove that there had been attempts to destabilize Belarus since the contested elections 
in August that led to massive protests.
The presidential election was widely regarded as manipulated and hundreds of thousands of people called for 
Lukashenko's resignation.
Putin emphasized his support for Lukashenko, saying trade between the two countries had increased.
Their meeting came five days after Belarus claimed the plane had to make an emergency landing in Minsk due to a 
bomb threat, a claim which proved unfounded. During the incident, Belarus sent a fighter jet to accompany the 
Ryanair flight.

Protasevich, a 26-year-old dissident journalist, and his partner were then taken into custody, prompting a raft of 
measures by the EU, including restricted access to the bloc's airspace for Belarusian carriers.
On Friday, further information emerged about the forced landing, suggesting that the plane had been diverted 
before an email alleging the threat had been sent.
"We can see when the email was sent, and we can confirm that the email in question was sent after the plane had 
been diverted," the Proton email service in Geneva told dpa.
"We have not seen credible evidence that the Belarusian claims are true," the service wrote.
Belarus had claimed that Hamas had sent the threat, a suggestion Hamas repudiated as "absurd" shortly 
afterwards.
Earlier on Friday, Lithuanian authorities announced that they had questioned the crew and 90 per cent of the 
passengers who were on board at the time. The investigation of the plane, which remains at the airport in Vilnius, is 
still ongoing, according to the BNS news agency.
Meanwhile it was unclear on Friday whether airlines that were following the EU's recommendation were being

case-by-case or had implemented a general rule, and would wait before taking any action.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov spoke of "technical problems" after the EU's decision, but said authorities 
were working to sort them out.
Later, Lithuania expelled two Belarusian diplomats for activities that were "not compatible with their status," the 
Foreign Ministry said. Belarus responded by expelling two Lithuanian diplomats.
Looking to the future, the European Commission suggested providing billions in aid to support democratic change in 
Belarus.
It could make 3 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) available to Minsk "once Belarus embarks on a democratic 
transition," the commission said in a press release.
The move should be seen as the bloc's commitment "to support the Belarusian people's wishes for a peaceful 
democratic transition in the country."

Lithuania wants to host the European Track Cycling Championships, which were stripped from Minsk in reaction to 
the forced landing of a passenger plane by Belarus.
European cycling body UEC took the June 23-27 event off Belarus after a Ryanair plane was forced to land in 
Minsk on Sunday and government critic Roman Protasevich was arrested on board.
"Infrastructure, experience, friendly fans and financial contribution - this is our pledge to UEC cycling and the 
athletes of 50 cycling federations," tweeted Lithuania Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte.
In a reply, the UEC showed an open mind tweeting: "Dear Prime Minister we would be delighted to develop your 
proposition."

The European track cycling championships planned for the end of June in Minsk have been cancelled due to the 
tense political situation in Belarus, ruling body UEC said on Thursday after a meeting in Lausanne.
"We have recently been monitoring the situation with the Belarus Cycling Federation which has now developed into 
an international debate and today during the Management Board meeting, we have decided to cancel the event in 
Minsk," UEC president Enrico Della Casa said.
"We are already working on finding an alternative solution," he added.
The German cycling federation had decided not to participate in the tournament in response to the forced landing of 
a plane in Minsk. The championships were to take place from June 23-27.
On Sunday a Ryanair passenger plane was forced to land in Minsk and authorities used it to have dissident 
Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich arrested at the airport.
The European Union has imposed new sanctions on the power apparatus in Belarus because of the action, 
including a landing ban for the former Soviet republic's airlines and sanctions on the leadership.
In January, Belarus' capital of Minsk had already been removed as co-host of this year's ice hockey world 
championships due to political unrest in the country.

Belarus' long-time president, Alexander Lukashenko, on Wednesday defended his internationally slammed decision 
to force the landing of a passenger plane with a dissident journalist on board.
"I acted lawfully by protecting people - according to all international rules," Lukashenko told the parliament in Minsk.
Authorities used Sunday's landing to have dissident Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich arrested at the airport 
in Minsk.
Lukashenko initially said, without elaborating, that Belarus had received information that there was an explosive 
device on the plane.
Therefore, he said, the plane, which was on its way to Lithuania from Greece, was diverted to Minsk with the 
assistance of a fighter jet.
The European Union has launched new sanctions against the power apparatus in Belarus because of the action, 
including a landing ban for former Soviet republic's airlines and sanctions on leadership.
"That the plane was forced to land by a MiG-29 fighter jet is an absolute lie!" said Lukashenko. Belarus acted for 
safety reasons, he said, because the plane flew over the country's nuclear power plant.
More than 100 people were on board the Ryanair flight that was forced to land, including Protasevich and his 
partner, Sofia Sapega. Both were arrested. Their fate is uncertain.

Belarus' long-time president, Alexander Lukashenko, on Wednesday defended his internationally slammed decision 
to force the landing this weekend of a passenger plane with a dissident journalist on board.
"I acted lawfully by protecting people - according to all international rules," Lukashenko told the parliament in Minsk.
Authorities used Sunday's landing to have dissident Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich arrested at the airport 
in Minsk.
Protasevich is a "terrorist," added Lukashenko, who said the 26-year-old blogger was planning a "bloody uprising" 
in Belarus.
"There was a terrorist on board the plane," he said, claiming that it was his country's sovereign right to detain its 
own citizens.
Lukashenko initially said, without elaborating, that Belarus had received information that there was an explosive

Lukashenko made other claims about Protasevich's past, including that he had fought on the side of government 
forces in eastern Ukraine and had "a lot of experience as a mercenary."
Protasevich had reported from Ukraine in 2014, when the war between pro-Russian forces and the central 
government in Kiev was breaking out. However, it has never been proven that he engaged in combat.

Fears grew on Tuesday that the Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was detained in Minsk 
after his plane was forcibly rerouted, has been subject to torture while in custody.
Natalia Protasevich, the mother of the journalist, said there was clear evidence that her son had been subject to 
violence, referring to footage released a day earlier from the Minsk pre-trial detention centre where he is being held.
He was arrested on Sunday after Belarusian authorities alerted the crew of his Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius 
of a possible security threat and directed it to land at an airport near Minsk.
President Alexander Lukashenko also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet to be scrambled to accompany the plane, 
according to the state news agency.
Authorities in Minsk then detained Protasevich and his girlfriend, who was also on board.
"I am not a surgeon, but it is certain that they hit his nose and may have broken it," Protasevich's mother said of the 
video that was circulated by the authorities.
She also said her son's left cheek was swollen and sagging. "Even under the make-up, you can see a yellowish 
tinge - probably bruises were covered with powder."
She said she also saw signs of strangulation on the neck of her son. "From the looks of it, they choked him to beat 
evidence out of him."
In the video, Protasevich, 26, said he was being treated in accordance with the law and confessed to having 
organized riots.
Fears grow that detained Belarusian journalist subject to torture
Her son was forced to make the statement, Protasevich said. "He either read it off the page or was forced to 
memorize it."
Her son is a very strong person, said Protasevich, who lives with her husband in exile in Poland. However, she said 
she feared the authorities might abuse his girlfriend in order to break her son.
Her fears were echoed by opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who said the international community must 
act in concert to prevent a repeat of Belarus' actions at the weekend.
Now is the time to discuss joint steps "to bring the perpetrators to justice," Tikhanovskaya, who lives in exile in 
Lithuania, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
The US should launch an investigation into the flight's forced landing and Protasevich's detention, she said after a 
phone call with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
"All of this is a result of the regime's impunity and the lack of a decisive response from the international community," 
she added.
On Tuesday, Russian newspaper RBK said Sofia Sapega, Protasevich's girlfriend, had been remanded in custody 
for two months, citing a lawyer.
In a video circulated by Belarusian state media, 23-year-old Sapega said she had also worked as an editor of an 
opposition Telegram channel and disseminated information about Belarusian security forces.
Belarusian blogger Stepan Putilo, the founder of the Nexta portal on Telegram along with Protasevich, told a Polish 
newspaper that he has been receiving death threats since Protasevich's arrest.
"They write to me that it's our turn next, that we won't be kidnapped to Belarus but shot in Warsaw," he told the 
Rzeczpospolita.
Nexta, the Belarusian opposition's main source of information during massive protests against long-time ruler 
Lukashenko, is based in Warsaw. Protasevich left Nexta at the end of 2020.
On Monday, the EU agreed to a package of sanctions, including the sealing-off of Belarusian airspace and a 
landing ban on its airlines in response to the forced landing of the plane.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the sanctions.
"This is a state hijacking and demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks 
down on freedom of expression and independent media," he said, adding that an urgent international investigation 
was needed.
Lufthansa, Air France and Finnair are the latest airlines to announce that they would be avoiding flying over Belarus 
for the time being.
Some 339 flights pass over Belarus per day to and from Europe, according to aviation authority Eurocontrol.
Belarus' state-owned airline said on Tuesday that it had suspended flights to London and Paris until the end of 
October in response to a landing ban by those countries, saying it regretted the situation.
Lukashenko was already under international pressure after disputed elections last year and a violent clampdown on 
widespread protests.

US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet on June 16 in Geneva for an eagerly 
anticipated face-to-face session that comes at a time of worsening tensions between the rival powers.
The White House and the Kremlin announced the date on Tuesday. The idea was proposed by Biden in a phone 
call to Putin in April, but until now the Kremlin has been cagey about whether or not Putin would accept the 
invitation.
The Kremlin said the two would discuss bilateral relations, strategic stability, settlement of regional conflicts and 
anti-pandemic cooperation, Russia's TASS news agency reported.
"The leaders will discuss the full range of pressing issues, as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the 
US-Russia relationship," read a White House statement.
For Biden, the meeting in the Swiss city will likely come at the end of his first overseas trip in office. He is already 
scheduled to attend the G7 summit in Cornwall, England from June 11 to 13, then travel to the NATO summit in 
Brussels on June 14.
Biden has raised the stakes in US relations with Putin, who has been in power more than two decades, since taking 
office in January.
US-Russia ties have nose-dived over Washington's allegations of election interference and cyberattacks, the 
treatment of jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny and the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The two sides have imposed a wave of sanctions and counter-sanctions and expelled each other's diplomats.
Eagerly awaited Biden-Putin summit set for June 16 in Geneva
The recent forced diversion of a Ryanair flight by Belarus - whose longtime authoritarian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko is backed by Putin - has provided the latest point of contention.
During an interview in March, Biden responded affirmatively when asked if he thought Putin was "a killer" - an 
answer that outraged the Kremlin - and warned Putin would "pay a price" for the election interference.
"President Biden is meeting with Vladimir Putin because of our countries' differences, not in spite of them. It's an 
opportunity to raise concerns where we have them and to move toward a more stable and predictable relationship," 
said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.
"We're not suggesting that at the end of this it's going to be easy breezy from here," she said.
In recent days, US and Russian officials have been laying the groundwork for the summit.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov met in Iceland last week, while 
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev met in 
Geneva on Monday.

The European Union is readying to seal off its airspace and airports to Belarusian airlines after a passenger flight 
between two EU states was forcibly diverted to Minsk in order to detain a dissident Belarusian journalist.
"This outrageous behaviour needs a strong answer," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, 
slamming the "state hijacking" as an attack on democracy, freedom of expression and European sovereignty.
In a joint statement signed off at a summit in Brussels, the bloc's leaders instructed relevant officials to "adopt 
necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports."
The 27 premiers also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarusian territory, which von der Leyen said 
was no longer safe.
Once implemented, state airline Belavia will not be able to fly to a host of cities, including to Berlin, Paris and 
Brussels. It will also likely have to re-route its flights to, for example, Tunisia, as the most direct flight path crosses 
EU air space.
The member states also demanded the immediate release of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich and his 
partner Sofia Sapega.
Both were on board a Ryanair flight between EU countries Greece and Lithuania on Sunday that was rerouted to 
the Belarusian capital shortly before it reached Vilnius due to an alleged bomb threat. No bomb was found.
The 26-year-old journalist had been taken into pre-trial detention, Belarusian authorities confirmed on Monday.
EU to seal off skies to Belarusian air traffic after flight diversion
The incident leapt onto the summit's agenda at the last minute and soured relations with the authoritarian 
government even further.
The EU also decided to sanction Belarusian individuals involved in the plane's diversion and economic actors that 
finance the country's regime, von der Leyen said. A list of individuals and companies will be drawn up at a later 
stage.
The punitive measures were agreed on relatively quickly after leaders headed into their meeting on Monday 
evening, with multiple premiers having publicly voiced their support for sanctions throughout the day.
Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda called the forced landing "abhorrent." Similarly, Irish Prime Minister Micheal 
Martin called the diversion "appalling, reckless and unacceptable."
The incident also has implications for the country's EU funds. A 3-billion-euro (3.7-billion-dollar) EU investment and 
economic package planned for Belarus is frozen until the country "turns democratic," von der Leyen said.
The EU member states also called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to "urgently investigate" the 
incident.
US President Joe Biden welcomed the EU calls for "targeted economic sanctions and other measures" and said he 
had asked his team to work on options to hold those responsible accountable in close coordination with the EU and 
other partners. He also called for an international investigation to ascertain the facts of the case.
Prior to the EU leaders' meeting, Belarus said it is open to an international investigation into the forced landing. 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Anatoly Glass rejected EU criticism, and said that Minsk had fully complied with 
international regulations.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said all of Minsk's explanations for the manoeuvre so far had been "totally 
unbelievable."
Belarus has seen months of protests - matched by a dogged crackdown - after authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko claimed victory in an election in August last year that the opposition sees as rigged.
Since the poll, which the EU maintains was neither free nor fair, the bloc has imposed sanctions over several 
rounds for human rights breaches. The total of targeted individuals is currently 88, including Lukashenko himself, 
plus seven entities.
The 66-year-old has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, Lithuania 
and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
Minsk has grown closer to Moscow in recent years. But Lukashenko has also maintained relations with EU partners 
in his almost 27 years in power.

The German track cycling team has withdrawn from the European Championships due to take place in Belarus after 
Minsk forced an aircraft to land there and arrested a dissident.
The German Cycling Federation (BDR) said in a statement on Tuesday it had "contacted the European Cycling 
Union (UEC) after the events of the weekend and made it clear that under these circumstances it is not possible for 
the German national track cycling team to take part."
The European Championships are scheduled for Minsk from June 23-27 but the BDR said it had urged the UEC "to 
find an alternative solution".
At a meeting in Lausanne on Thursday, the UEC will discuss whether it should relocate the championships, with 
Minsk a controversial choice even before the plane drama due to allegations long-time ruler Alexander Lukashenko 
rigged last year's election.
Belarus forced a Ryanair plane flying from Athens to Vilnius to land in Minsk on Sunday and arrested government 
critic Roman Protasevich, who had been on board.
The European Union has imposed sanctions, including a ban on Belarusian airlines landing in the EU.

European nations were demanding answers after Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force a Ryanair 
flight to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who was on board was then arrested.
Ryanair said its plane was flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday when it was notified of "a potential security 
threat on board" by air traffic controllers in Belarus and told to divert to Minsk for an emergency landing.
The airline said the plane landed safely in Belarusian capital and "nothing untoward was found" after passengers 
were offloaded and an inspection took place.
But authorities at the airport used the opportunity to arrest Roman Protasevich, a Belarusian journalist and 
opposition activist, who was a passenger, according to state media and the rights group Viasna.
The opposition news outlet Nexta also confirmed the arrest of Protasevich, the organization's co-founder and 
former editor who has been living in exile.
Governments across Europe reacted with the outrage, suggesting authoritarian Belarus used the pretext of a safety 
threat to conduct a "state hijacking" of a civilian airliner in order to go after a critic.
Belarusian state media reported that the plane's diversion came on the personal instructions of long-time President 
Alexander Lukashenko after he had purportedly been alerted to a possible bomb on board and was concerned 
about the plane's safety.
He also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet be scrambled to accompany the Ryanair plane, according to the Belta state 
news agency.
Belarus activist arrested after fighter jet intercepts Ryanair flight
Lukashenko, 66, has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, 
Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
Mass protests against his rule erupted after a presidential election last year that was widely seen as unfair and rife 
with electoral fraud.
Belarus calls Nexta an extremist organization and Protasevich has been wanted by authorities. Nexta had urged on 
the protests against Lukashenko.
Lukashenko has long considered Protasevich to be an enemy. The country's KGB secret service had reportedly put 
his name on a list of people accused of alleged terrorism and he faces years in prison if convicted.
Condemnation of Belarus came swiftly on Sunday, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg calling for an 
international investigation and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying the "utterly 
unacceptable" incident "must bear consequences."
The United States demanded Protasevich be immediately released. Secretary of State Antony Blinken strongly 
condemned the forced diversion and Protasevich's arrest.
"This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including U.S. citizens," Blinken said in a statement.
The 27 EU leaders will discuss Belarus during a previously scheduled summit in Brussels on Monday, including the 
possibility of imposing sanctions on Minsk, a spokesperson for EU Council President Charles Michel said.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted that Belarus had committed an "abhorrent action" and demanded 
the release of Protasevich.
The Lithuanian Prosecutor-General's Office said the country has launched a preliminary investigation into the jet's 
forced diversion.
The Greek Foreign Ministry said it "strongly condemns the state hijacking," while Britain, Germany, France, Poland, 
Austria, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands were among the chorus denouncing Minsk.
Ryanair Flight FR4978 was en route from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius when it was ordered to land in 
Minsk.
Former Belarusian culture minister Pavel Latushko, who lives in exile in the EU, said, citing his contacts, that the 
flight control centre in Minsk threatened the pilots with shooting down the plane if they did not land.
Greece and Lithuania put the number of passengers on board at 171, although Ryanair has not provided a figure. 
Lithuania said most of the passengers were Lithuanian nationals. Belarus had said the plane had 123 passengers.
The Irish low-cost airline said the plane spent seven hours on the ground in Minsk undergoing security checks 
before it was allowed to depart at 8:50 pm (1750 GMT). It landed in Vilnius a little over 30 minutes later.
Ryanair made no mention of Protasevich in its statement.
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who many in Belarus consider the true winner of the 
2020 presidential election, urged the international community to punish Lukashenko.

The whereabouts of dissident Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich, who was taken into custody after a 
passenger plane he was on was forced to land in Minsk at the weekend, remain unknown on Monday.
Protasevich, a 26-year-old blogger and activist who was wanted in his homeland for inciting protests against long-
time leader Alexander Lukashenko, among other charges, was arrested after his Ryanair flight from Greece to 
Lithuania made an emergency landing on Sunday.
His father, Dmitry, said in an interview with Belarusian radio broadcaster Radio Svoboda that he was convinced that 
the careful operation did "not only involve" the country's secret service.
Russia is a close ally of Belarus.
"The operation was of a large enough scale to spit on the entire international community and their opinion," added 
the dissident's father, who called the forced landing "an act of terrorism."
"We are very worried about our son," said Dmitry Protasevich. "Unfortunately, we don't know where he is and how 
he's doing."
Governments across Europe reacted with outrage, suggesting authoritarian Belarus used the pretext of a safety 
threat to conduct a "state hijacking" of a civilian airliner to go after a critic.
Belarusian state media reported that the plane's diversion came on Lukashenko's personal instructions, after he 
had purportedly been alerted to a possible bomb on board. He also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet be scrambled to 
accompany the Ryanair plane, according to the Belta news agency.
Lukashenko, 66, has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, 
Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.

Calls to create a no-fly zone over Belarus' airspace and ban its planes from landing grew louder on Monday as 
European countries looked for ways to express how angry they were at the forced landing of a Ryanair flight with a 
dissident onboard in Minsk.The whereabouts of dissident Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich, who was taken 
into custody after the passenger plane he was on was forced to land in Belarus' capital at the weekend, remain

Protasevich, a 26-year-old blogger and activist who was wanted in his homeland for inciting protests against long-

Lithuania made an emergency landing on Sunday.
Governments across Europe have reacted with outrage, suggesting authoritarian Belarus used the pretext of a 
safety threat to conduct a "state hijacking" of a civilian airliner to go after a critic.
The European Union was considering punitive measures, including sanctions on those responsible for the incident, 
as well as a landing ban for the Belarusian airline Belavia at all airports in the bloc and the declaration of the 
airspace over Belarus as a no-fly zone.
Leaders in Latvia and France are already pushing to close off Belarusian airspace to international flights. Airlines 
including Wizz Air and Air Baltic are rerouting their flights accordingly.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the International Civil Aviation Organisation council should meet "to 
consider the regime's flouting of the international rules safeguarding civil aviation."
EU leaders will discuss possible measures at a summit later on Monday.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary believes that KGB agents were aboard the passenger flight that was 
forced to land in Minsk.
"It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist and his travelling companion," the head of the 
Irish budget airline told radio broadcaster Newstalk on Monday. "We believe there were some KGB agents 
offloaded at the airport as well," he added.
O'Leary praised the flight crew for handling the situation well and said the incident was frightening for passengers 
and staff, who were detained for hours by gunmen in Belarus after the emergency landing.
Dmitry Protasevich expressed worry about his son: "Unfortunately, we don't know where he is and how he's doing."
The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, and Amnesty International are among those who have called for 
Protasevich's immediate release.

The EU could decide to sanction Belarus on Monday evening when the 27 premiers meet in Brussels following the 
forced landing of a Ryanair flight and the arrest of a journalist.
On the table are, among other measures, targeted sanctions against people responsible for the forced landing of 
the commercial flight between Athens and Vilnius.
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who had been on board, was taken into custody after the flight was 
diverted to the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on allegations of a bomb threat.
The manoeuvre caused international outrage. The bloc's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell called it "yet another 
blatant attempt by the Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices."
"In carrying out this coercive act, the Belarusian authorities have jeopardised the safety of passengers and crew," 
he said, calling for an international investigation and for Protasevich to be released.
"The EU will consider the consequences of this action, including taking measures against those responsible."
Other options include banning national airline Belavia from landing at EU airports or ordering EU airlines to avoid 
Belarusian airspace, although this is legally more complicated than targeting individuals.
The EU summoned Belarusian ambassador Aleksandr Mikhnevich, during which he "was informed of the firm 
condemnation by the EU institutions," according to a statement.
The meeting in Brussels was initially scheduled to focus on debates on the bloc's strategy towards Russia, for 
example, and was expected to be relatively uneventful.
However, with Belarusian authorities having forced an EU airline flight between two EU countries to land, the 
premiers might feel forced to react strongly.

The European Union could decide to sanction Belarus once again on Monday evening after the country forced a 
Ryanair flight to land and detained a Belarusian opposition journalist on board.
The incident, which interrupted a flight between two EU countries, has leapt onto the agenda of a Brussels summit 
at the last minute, souring relations between Minsk and the bloc even further.
European Council President Charles Michel slammed the move by Minsk as an "international scandal" that put the 
lives of European civilians at risk.
EU officials were drafting a variety of punitive measures for the bloc to consider, Michel said. "I hope tonight we can 
make a decision on that," he told journalists before the summit.
One possibility is targeted sanctions against people responsible for what EU governments and officials said was a 
state "hijacking" of a commercial flight between Athens and Vilnius on Sunday.
This would be the fourth round of punitive measures since October.
The member states could also ban national airline Belavia from landing at EU airports or order EU airlines to avoid 
Belarusian airspace. This is legally more complicated than targeting individuals, however.
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who had been on board, was taken into custody after the flight was 
diverted to the Belarusian capital on allegations of a bomb threat.
The manoeuvre caused international outrage. The bloc's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell called it "yet another 
blatant attempt by the Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices."

"In carrying out this coercive act, the Belarusian authorities have jeopardised the safety of passengers and crew," 
he said, calling for an international investigation and for 26-year-old Protasevich to be released.
Belarus said it is open to an international investigation into the forced landing. Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
Anatoly Glass rejected EU criticism saying Minsk had had fully complied with international regulations.
Belarus has seen months of protests - matched with a dogged crackdown - after authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko claimed victory in an election in August last year that the opposition sees as rigged.
Since the poll, which the EU maintains was neither free nor fair, the bloc has imposed sanctions over several 
rounds. The total of targeted individuals is currently 88, including Lukashenko himself, plus seven entities.
The 66-year-old has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, Lithuania 
and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
NATO ambassadors were set to discuss the matter on Tuesday. Britain is also weighing sanctions.
The EU summoned Belarusian ambassador Aleksandr Mikhnevich, during which he "was informed of the firm 
condemnation by the EU institutions," according to a statement. Several member states also hauled in Belarusian 
envoys bilaterally.
The Brussels summit was initially scheduled to focus on debates on the bloc's strategy towards Russia, for 
example, and was expected to be relatively uneventful.
Minsk has grown closer to Moscow in recent years. But Lukashenko has also maintained relations with EU partners 
in his almost 27 years in power.

The European Union could decide on Monday evening to seal off its airspace off to Belarusian airlines after the 
country forced a Ryanair flight to land and detained a Belarusian opposition journalist on board.
According to a draft document seen by dpa, EU leaders could also call on all EU-based airlines to avoid flying over 
the state's territory following what several officials and governments have slammed as either "state hijacking" or 
even "terrorism."
If implemented, state airline Belavia would have to cancel its flights to a host of cities, including to Berlin, Paris, and 
Brussels. It would also likely have to re-route its flights to for example Tunisia, as the most direct flight path crosses 
EU air space.
The incident, which interrupted a flight between EU countries Greece and Lithuania on Sunday, leapt onto the 
agenda of a Brussels summit at the last minute and soured relations with the authoritarian government even further.
The 27 leaders are now examining various sanctions options, which according to European Commission President 
Urusla von der Leyen include targeting the Belarusian aviation sector, businesses that support the country's 
"regime" and people involved in the diversion.
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who had been on board, was taken into custody after the flight was 
diverted to the Belarusian capital on allegations of a bomb threat. No bomb was found.
The 26-year-old has been taken into pre-trial detention, Belarusian authorities confirmed on Monday.
Lithuania's president Gitanas Nauseda calling the forced landing "abhorrent" and said that Belarusian airspace 
could be declared unsafe.
EU could seal off skies to Belarusian airlines after forced landing
Similarly, Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin called the diversion "appalling, reckless and unacceptable."
If the draft leaders' statement seen by dpa is adopted, the bloc will also call on the International Civil Aviation 
Organization to "urgently investigate" the incident.
One EU diplomat told dpa they believed all member states supported the statement.
Von der Leyen was among those calling for Protasevich's release. "We will put pressure on the regime as long as it 
finally respects the freedom of media ... and the freedom of opinion," she told reporters before the summit.
A 3-billion-euro (3.7-billion-dollar) EU investment and economic package planned for Belarus is frozen until the 
country "turns democratic," she added.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also demanded the release of Protasevich's partner, Sofia Sapega, who is 
believed to have been detained along with him.
No bomb was found aboard and Merkel said all of Minsk's explanations for the manoeuvre so far had been "totally 
unbelievable."
Belarus said it is open to an international investigation into the forced landing. Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
Anatoly Glass rejected EU criticism, and said that Minsk had fully complied with international regulations.
Belarus has seen months of protests - matched by a dogged crackdown - after authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko claimed victory in an election in August last year that the opposition sees as rigged.
Since the poll, which the EU maintains was neither free nor fair, the bloc has imposed sanctions over several

The United States has demanded the "immediate release" of dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was 
arrested when Belarusian authorities diverted a Ryanair plane flying to Minsk.
Ryanair said its plane was flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday when it was notified of "a potential security 
threat on board" by air traffic controllers in Belarus and told to divert to Minsk for an emergency landing.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken strongly condemned the forced diversion and Protasevich's arrest. Belarusian 
state media earlier reported that the country's President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the diversion.
"This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including U.S. citizens," Blinken said in a statement.
"Initial reports suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military 
aircraft to escort the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation."
The US said it was coordinating its response with partners including the EU and Lithuanian and Greek officials.

A trio of discount airlines were fined on Monday by Italian authorities because they only offered credits - not cash 
back - for flights that had to be cancelled last year amid the pandemic.
The fines affect Irish airline Ryanair, British airline Easyjet and Spanish airline Volotea and pertain to flights 
cancelled after June 3, 2020.
The AGCM competition authority said the businesses had employed confusing practices and provided confusing 
information to customers that left them unclear about their rights.
The decision to hand out credits, which could be used for subsequent flight purchases, made it harder for 
passengers to decide to seek cash reimbursement.
The authority's decision will require Ryanir to pay a 4.2-million-euro fine, while Easy jet will be on the hook for 2.8 
million euros and Volotea for 1.4 million euros.
The AGCM also noted that passengers on some airlines were not given the option of using a toll-free phone 
number if they wanted to call in to redeem the flight credits.

Fifty-one passengers, including five crew members, are affected.
The additional caution follows the forced landing of a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania by Belarus this

Latvian airline Air Baltic announced on Monday that it will avoid Belarusian airspace until further notice, after a 
Ryanair passenger flight was forced to land in Minsk the previous day, apparently so authorities could detain a 
dissident on board.
The airline said that it would stay out of Belarus' airspace until the situation became clearer or authorities issue a 
decision.
Latvia's Civil Aviation Authority is expected to make a recommendation soon, according to Transport Minister Talis 
Linkaits.
"It is clear that the situation in principle is unacceptable when a country can decide whether it likes or dislikes one or 
another passenger on the plane," Linkaits told a Latvian radio broadcaster.
Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics broached the idea of a ban on flights by Belarusian airlines, in addition to 
economic sanctions and the closing of Belarusian airspace to international flights.
However, no official decision has been made so far, says Linkaits.

The European Union could seal off its airspace and all airports to Belarusian airlines and call for all EU-based 
carriers to avoid flying over the country, according to a draft document seen by dpa.
If the 27 EU leaders agree to a draft brought forward by European Council President Charles Michel during their 
meeting on Monday, they will "strongly" condemn the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk.
According to the draft, which was confirmed as authentic by several EU diplomats, the European Council "calls on 
all EU-based carriers to avoid overflight of Belarus."
The leaders would also call on the relevant EU body to "to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU 
airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines."
If adopted, the premiers will also call on the International Civil Aviation Organization to "urgently investigate" the 
incident. They also want to sanction additional Belarusian individuals.
One EU diplomat said they believed all EU member states supported the draft.

European leaders are demanding answers after a Ryanair flight was diverted to an airport in Belarus on Sunday, 
apparently so authorities in Minsk could detain a blogger who had been travelling from Athens to Vilnius in the 
plane.
The Irish airline Ryanair confirmed the incident. Crew on the plane had been alerted to a possible security threat by 
Belarusian authorities and directed to land at an airport near Minsk, the company said. "Nothing untoward was 
found," it said.
"Ryanair has notified the relevant national and European safety and security agencies and we apologise sincerely 
to all affected passengers for this regrettable delay, which was outside Ryanair's control," read a statement.
According to Belarusian media, Minsk used the opportunity to detain Roman Protasevich, a blogger critical of the 
government who was on the plane.
According to Viasna, a Belarusian human rights group, Protasevich was detained after the plane landed.
Nexta, another opposition news channel, and one that was founded by Protasevich, confirmed that he had been 
detained.
Belarus calls Nexta an extremist organization. It had repeatedly called for mass protests against Lukashenko's rule 
after Lukashenko claimed victory in disputed elections in August.
Lukashenko has long considered Protasevich to be an enemy. The country's KGB secret service had put his name 
on a list of people accused of alleged terrorism, according to the tut.by internet portal, in a report released via the 
Telegram messaging app.
Ryanair confirms flight diverted to Belarus amid worry about blogger
Speaking to local media, airport officials confirmed that a fighter jet had intercepted the plane, which then asked for 
permission to land. Furthermore, they said that the bomb scare proved to be a hoax and that the other 123 
passengers on board are waiting at the airport so they can continue their journey.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda demanded Protasevich's immediate release.
"Unprecedented event!" he wrote on Twitter. "Belarusian regime is behind the abhorrent action."
So far, Ryanair says the plane is now expected to continue with its journey at 1600 GMT. But there was no word on 
Protasevich.
Lithuania demanded that Belarus release all passengers and crew. Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said 
there were 171 passengers on the flight and that Lithuania had gathered details on 149 of them. It said most of the 
passengers were Lithuanian nationals, but there were multiple citizens from other EU countries on board.
Condemnation came in quickly from a variety of countries, such as Austria, Germany and Sweden, as well as the 
European Union. There were demands for an investigation.

Belarus' military required a civilian plane flying over its territory to land on Sunday, after which officials arrested a 
blogger wanted by the government and had him taken away, according to Belarusian media.
Roman Protasevich, the blogger, was on a Athens-to-Vilnius flight from Ryanair when a fighter jet intercepted the 
plane's path, at which point the airliner asked permission to land, according to Belarusian media reports.
Other reports said that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had ordered the action after a report of a bomb 
on the plane. There was no immediate comment from Ryanair.
According to Viasna, a Belarusian human rights group, Protasevich was detained after the plane landed. Opposition 
groups said the act was an unparalleled move by Minsk into international airspace.
Nexta, another opposition news channel, and one that was founded by Protasevich, confirmed that he had been 
detained.

Vilnius, Ryanair said in a statement. The plane landed at 9:25 pm (1825 GMT).

The Greek Foreign Ministry has slammed the forced diversion of a Ryanair passenger flight to Minsk and the arrest 
of an opposition blogger who was on board.
"Greece strongly condemns the state hijacking that took place today, which resulted in the forced landing of Ryanair 
FR 4978, which operated the Athens-Vilnius route, in Minsk, Belarus," a ministry statement said.
"The plane had a total of 171 passengers, 11 of whom are Greek citizens. This act, which endangered the lives of 
all passengers, is unacceptable."
The Foreign Ministry condemned the arrest of Belarusian activist Roman Protasevich at the Minsk airport.
Protasevich was part of a delegation in Greece that participated in the international "Delphi Forum" last week, the 
Foreign Ministry added.
Every year, the Delphi Forum invites experts and politicians to discuss political and economic issues.
"Mr Protasevich was part of a delegation led by Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who 
recently attended the Delphi Forum.
"For Greece, defending fundamental values such as democracy, the rule of law, and human rights is a matter of 
principle," the ministry statement said.

Germany's foreign minister has condemned the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger jet in Belarus and the 
subsequent arrest of a prominent opposition activist who was on board.
"The fact that a flight between two EU states was forced to make a stopover under the pretext of a bomb threat is a 
serious interference in civil air traffic in Europe," Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement, calling for "clear 
consequences" to be taken against the government in Minsk.
"We are very concerned about reports that journalist Roman Protasevich was arrested this way," Maas said of the 
activist.
He urged the issue to be taken up at a previously scheduled meeting of EU leaders on Monday in Brussels.
The Ryanair plane was en route from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Sunday when it was ordered to 
land in Minsk by air traffic controllers who said they had identified a potential security threat on board.

The European Union's second highest court dealt a blow to the European Commission on Wednesday, ruling that a 
complaint by Ryanair about state aid to other airline companies was justified.
The court annulled the commission's decisions approving coronavirus-related state aid to Dutch KLM and 
Portuguese airline TAP. The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to 
be paid out, the court ruled on Wednesday.
However, the effects of the annulment - including the order to pay back the aid - are suspended until the 
commission submits a new decision. Effectively, this means that the EU General Court's judges are giving the 
commission a chance to issue a more detailed decision.
The commission had green-lighted state support of 3.4 billion euros (4.15 billion dollars) for KLM and 1.2 billion 
euros for TAP.
Ryanair took the commission to court in a slew of cases, arguing that this move distorted competition in the bloc.
While the court sided with Ryanair in the cases of KLM and TAP, it ruled that 10-billion-euro aid to "strategic 
Spanish undertakings experiencing temporary difficulties due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic" was 
appropriate.
Ryanair also lost similar cases related to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair last month, which a spokesperson said the 
company would appeal.
A Ryanair spokesperson welcomed Wednesday's decisions on TAP and KLM.
"Unless halted by the EU courts in line with today's rulings, this state aid spree will distort the market for decades to 
come," the spokesperson said.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, landed deep in the red in the past fiscal year due to the impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic on passenger numbers.
Ryanair posted a loss of 815 million euros (989 million dollars) over the 12 months that ended March 31, compared 
to a profit of just over 1 billion euros in the same period a year earlier, chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a 
presentation on Monday.
The airline's passenger traffic fell 81 per cent over the previous year, to 27.5 million.
For the current fiscal year, management believes in a result close to the break-even point, but would not risk a 
concrete forecast due to continuing uncertainty around the pandemic.
However, the overall expectation was that vaccination campaigns will be successful in Europe and governments will 
lift travel restrictions in time for the all-important summer season starting in July.
Looking forward to the next 12 months, Ryanair sees a rebound in traffic in the second half of the year and expects 
total passenger numbers for the period to be at the lower end of its issued target range of 80 million to 120 million 
passengers.
In the current first fiscal quarter to the end of June, the figure is expected to be just 5 to 6 million.

The Irish budget flight company Ryanair was handed a duo of defeats at the European Union's General Court in 
lawsuits against state bailouts for competitor airlines on Wednesday.
The millions of euros in coronavirus-related economic aid provided to Scandinavian airline SAS by Sweden and 
Denmark, and to Finnair by the Finnish government was in line with EU law, judges at the Luxembourg-based court 
found.
Ryanair immediately announced it would appeal the two rulings at the bloc's highest court, the European Court of 
Justice.
The company had challenged decisions by the European Commission - which oversees competition in the single 
market - to approve the aid packages.
But the EU judges found that the measures taken to prop up SAS were proportionate.
In the case of Finnair, they noted above all that a possible default would have had a considerable impact on 
Finland's economic health.In both cases, the state aid was found to be appropriate to achieve the objective 
pursued.In recent months, Ryanair has taken several state aid cases to the bloc's high court Court of Justice. In 
February, the company already failed in legal action against aid granted by France and Sweden.

Ryanair pledges 2,300 flights a week during the summer holidays
Ryanair pledges 2,300 flights a week during the summer holidays

Ryanair vowed on Wednesday to return to a near-normal summer schedule this year by flying 2,300 flights a week 
from Britain to Europe.
The Irish discount airline said it will be running the flights across 480 routes and is also launching 26 new routes, 
including from London to the Greek islands of Santorini and Zakynthos, this summer.
The schedule means that Ryanair would be running at about 80 per cent of its usual capacity.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said that, because of the government's successful vaccine roll-out, Britain is "on 
track" for a reopening of European short-haul flights.
He also said passengers may be asked to wear face masks on Ryanair flights until 2022.
"I would imagine at this point in time, we're planning to continue to require mandatory face mask-wearing on board 
our aircraft through the remainder of this summer schedule and next winter's schedule," he said.
But while Britons may be keen to book a summer getaway, the British prime minister has been more cautious.
Boris Johnson has repeatedly been cagey regarding whether or not people should book overseas holidays, stating 
it is "too early" to tell.
In a briefing to journalists on Tuesday, he said "things certainly look difficult for the time being" and added that more 
detail would be revealed on April 5 - the next review date of whether England can lift restrictions as planned.

Ireland's Human Rights and Equality Commission on Thursday accused the government of having "persistently 
blurred the boundary between legal requirements and public health guidance in its Covid-19 response."
In a report co-authored with academics from Dublin's Trinity College, the commission said that "parliamentary 
oversight of Ireland's emergency legislation has been lacking."
On Tuesday the government announced that a third lockdown, imposed in late December to stem what became 
a record-breaking spike in novel coronavirus cases, will be extended until at least April 5.
While not giving any end date for restrictions, Prime Minister Micheal Martin said "the end is in truly in sight," citing 
vaccinations.
The commission, an independent public body, said that the government's "making and presentation of regulations 
raises serious rule-of-law concerns."
Sinead Gibney, the chief commissioner, criticized "the systems that implement and scrutinize these decisions," 
while Trinity College's Oran Doyle accused the government of blurring legal obligations and public health advice.
Ireland's police said last week around 8,000 fines had been issued for alleged breaches of the restrictions. The 
commission said "public health guidance" should not be enforced "as if it were law."
Ireland's pandemic restrictions are among the harshest anywhere, according to a University of Oxford 
database. Non-essential travel is limited to within 5 kilometres of a person's home, most pubs have been closed 
since March last year, and public religious services are banned.
Airline Ryanair last year lost a court case challenging the government's travel restrictions. A case filed against the 
worship ban was adjourned for a fourth time this week.

An advertisement published by Irish airline Ryanair which said people could have a "jab" and then "go" on holiday 
has been pulled by Britain's advertising watchdog.
The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) said it received 2,370 complaints about Ryanair's advert, aired between 
December 26 and January 3, making it the third most complained about advertisement of all time.
The ad was broadcast on television and depicted a syringe with a text saying "vaccines are coming."
A voiceover followed, stating: "Covid vaccines are coming. So book your Easter and summer holidays today with 
Ryanair. One million seats on sale from 19.99 pounds (27 dollars) to sunshine destinations in Spain, Italy, Portugal, 
Greece and many more. So you could jab and go!" 
Viewers who complained said that the advertisement implied most of the population would be successfully 
vaccinated against Covid-19 by the spring or summer of 2021 and would be able to travel.
They added the adverts were misleading, irresponsible and found the phrase "jab and go" offensive.
After an investigation, the ASA upheld the claims the advert was misleading and irresponsible but said it was not 
offensive under its rules.
Ryanair told dpa it "respectfully disagrees" with the ASA's decision, describing the advert as "factual and accurate" 
as vaccines were being rolled out.
"The ASA's ruling flies in the face of the UK's successful vaccine rollout, however even though this ruling is 
baseless, Ryanair will comply with it and the Jab & Go adverts will not run again," a spokesperson added.

EU flight safety agency to approve Boeing 's 737 Max jet
EU flight safety agency to approve Boeing's 737 Max jet

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is expected to approve Boeing's crisis-ridden 737 Max jet, 
enabling it to return to the skies in the coming days.
The approval was expected next week, after changes made to the plane model fulfilled flight safety conditions, 
EASA executive director Patrick Ky said in an online press conference on Tuesday.
The fleet of medium-haul jets was grounded in March 2019, after two 737 Max crashes due to faulty steering 
software in which a total of 346 people died.
The 737 Max has since been approved again in the United States and Brazil.
In Canada, the grounding of the aircraft is to be lifted this Wednesday, following an announcement by the local 
aviation authority Transport Canada. The airline Air Canada has said it will begin using the jet again from February 
1.
Before the 737 Max returns to Europe, pilot training has to be completed, Ky said.
The special 737 Max 200 ordered by low-cost carrier Ryanair will be certified in the coming weeks and be ready for 
the summer, he added.
Boeing had aimed to fix the problems following the first of the two crashes.
However, further defects were uncovered, meaning that it ultimately took around 20 months for the US Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) to lift the flight ban for that country in mid-November.
Ky said there had been full transparency from the FAA and Boeing after the accidents.

The EASA chief said the European regulator had also tested the jet without the controversial MCAS software. The 
737 Max would be "a plan that flies safely without MCAS," he said.
The first of the two crashes occurred shortly after take-off from Jakarta on October 29, 2018, and killed all 189 
people on board.
The second occurred in March the following year, shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa. That crash killed all 157 
people on board.
In both cases, a sensor provided incorrect data to the software, prompting the nose to dive. Pilots were unable to 
override the automatic settings.
The new version of the software is to be fed data from two sensors. In addition, pilots are to receive training on how 
to recognize when faulty data is being delivered, Ky said.
EASA had also demanded the installation of a third sensor known as a synthetic sensor, which is yet to be 
developed.
In the long version of the jet series, the 737 Max 10, which has not yet been certified, this is to be mandatory from 
the outset. In other models, it is to be retrofitted at a later date.

European air traffic controllers are anticipating a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in the aviation sector 
this year, according to an analysis published in Brussels on Monday.
The European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) predicts flights and passengers at 
just 51 per cent of pre-crisis levels, following the cancellation of around 6.1 million flights and the loss of 1.7 billion 
passengers last year.
While airlines were the main beneficiaries of state assistance over the course of 2020, airports would be heavily 
reliant on state subsidies over the year ahead, the organization said.
"We're confident that the recovery will start to firm up in 2021 as the vaccine rolls out across the globe. However, 
it's clear that the entire aviation sector will continue to need financial support in the years ahead," EUROCONTROL 
director general Eamonn Brennan said.
According to the analysis, the Lufthansa Group had to cancel 67 per cent of its flights, as had Easyjet. IAG, which 
operates British Airways and Iberia, lost 65 per cent of its flights.
Ryanair flew 59 per cent fewer flights than in 2019 and Air France/KLM 55 per cent fewer.
Frankfurt lost its top spot in handling flights to Amsterdam, where the decline was lower.
At the end of the year, some 51 per cent of European airlines' fleets were grounded, totalling 4,118 of 8,048 planes. 
In April, the figure reached a peak of 87 per cent.

Ryanair has struck a deal with German flight attendants regarding pay cuts during the coronavirus crisis, the Irish 
budget airline and the German trade union Verdi said on Wednesday.
Ryanair said the deal encompasses moderate pay cuts to preserve jobs in Germany, following a similar agreement 
with German pilots.
Verdi representative Susana Pereira spoke of a very difficult decision for employees, although they ultimately 
consented.
The deal between Verdi and Ryanair's subsidiary Malta Air shields cabin employees from being fired due to 
operational reasons for the duration of the short-time work scheme.
Short-time work means employees are forced to reduce their hours and accept lower pay, while the government 
usually makes up part of the lost wages.
The 500 concerned employees agreed to renounce a planned increase in pay rates, a Verdi spokesperson said.
Both sides also agreed to extend a social plan until after the crisis.
The duration of the deal was left open, as well as the question of state subsidies.
Malta Air reiterated its calls for government support for its employees while they are on short-time work.
A row regarding state support of Malta Air's employees has been going on for half a year, as it is disputed whether 
Malta Air has business activity in Germany.

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Thursday signed a deal with Boeing for 75 of the manufacturer's MAX-8200 aircraft, 
increasing a previous order for the aircraft from 135 to 210.
The Irish airline said the deal was worth a total of 22 billion dollars.
"Now that the Boeing MAX aircraft has been certified by the FAA to return to service, Ryanair expects to take the 
first deliveries of these new fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft from early 2021," the budget airline 
said.
The order is set to be delivered over a 4-year period ending in December 2024.
The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last week announced Boeing's troubled 737 MAX will be allowed to take 
to the skies over Europe again from mid-January.
The decision follows the green light given to the aircraft by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FASA).
EASA is leaving open a window of four weeks for public comment on its decision, with a final ruling expected from 
the middle of January next year.
The decision follows numerous hardware and software changes and the retraining of pilots on the 737 MAX.
The aircraft was grounded in March 2019 following the death of 346 people in two accidents, one in Indonesia in 
October 2018 and another in Ethiopia in March 2019.
The main cause of the accidents was considered to be faulty control software that directed the jets towards the 
ground. Pilots were unable to overpower the automatic settings.

During the relicensing procedure, EASA acted in concert with the FAA and Boeing, but took its own independent 
decision.

Budget airline Ryanair has posted a 226-million-euro (263-million-dollar) net loss for the second quarter of the 
financial year as the coronavirus pandemic continued to weigh on passenger numbers.
The announcement on Monday marks a sharp contrast to the same July-to-September period the previous year, 
when Ryanair record a profit of 910 million euros.
Ryanair's chief exectuve Michael O'Leary said that overall losses for the first half of the financial year - 411 million 
euros - were less red ink than the airline expects for the second half of the financial year.
O'Leary added that though the company currently expects passenger volume to reach 38 million during the entire 
financial year, it was impossible to give a prognosis considering the measures that are being imposed by national 
governments to contain the second wave of the pandemic.

Berlin's long-delayed BER airport to open as pandemic bites
Berlin's long-delayed BER airport to open as pandemic bites

The German capital is set to launch its new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport on Saturday, but without much fanfare as 
the coronavirus crisis presents the long-delayed project with its biggest challenge yet.
The airport, known by its three-letter code BER, is intended to overhaul the city's ageing air transport infrastructure.
The opening comes nine years behind schedule, while the budget has roughly tripled to 5.96 billion euros (7.04 
billion dollars) over the course of the new airport's already long history of setbacks and construction gaffes.
The pandemic has also added to spiralling costs for the state-backed operator of the airport.
The company is getting an additional 300 million euros from federal and state governments to get the airport 
through this crisis year, with another loan of around 550 million euros promised for next year.
Due to the economic uncertainty unleashed by the crisis, it remains unclear when the airport will become profitable.
Saturday's launch will apply only to Terminal 1; a recently finished Terminal 2 will not be needed initially after 
passenger numbers plunged to just 20 per cent of the 100,000 flyers that usually pass through Berlin's airports 
daily.
BER has incorporated Schoenefeld Airport, also located on the south-eastern outskirts of Berlin, as its Terminal 5.
Berlin's other airport, Tegel, located north-west of the city centre, is scheduled to close on November 8.
Two planes, from Easyjet and Ryanair, are set to become the first to land at the new airport at around 2 pm (1300 
GMT).

Italian regulators said on Friday they had convinced four low-cost airlines, including Ryanair, to give refunds - rather 
than just vouchers - for flights cancelled due to the coronavirus.
The Italian competition authority (AGCM) said it would no longer pursue an antitrust probe against Ryanair, 
easyJet, Vueling and Blue Panorama, since they complied with its requests.
As well as giving the option of a refund, the four airlines also agreed to allow free-of-charge access to their 
customer services and increase staffing at their call centres, the authority said.
AGCM had started proceedings against the carriers in late September.

Low-cost airline Ryanair is to reduce its winter flight schedule due to coronavirus travel restrictions and a significant 
drop in bookings.
Ryanair plans to take down its capacity to 40 per cent between November and March compared to last year, the 
carrier announced in a statement on Thursday.
Ryanair had originally planned to reduce its capacity to only 60 per cent, but a further drop in bookings prompted 
the additional cut, the company said.
It added it was expecting to operate at 70-per-cent capacity, compared to 95-per-cent capacity in 2019.
"While the Covid situation remains fluid and hard to predict, we must now cut our full year traffic forecast to 38 
million guests," Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Last year, Ryanair and its subsidiaries carried 149 million passengers.
O'Leary accused EU governments of mismanaging air travel during the coronavirus crisis. He urged them to 
implement the European Union's traffic-light system, which allows for travel between regions with low infection 
rates.

Airline Ryanair has endorsed a Friday judgement by Ireland's High Court that the government's pandemic travel 
measures are advisory rather than mandatory.
Despite losing the case, Ryanair said in a statement it "welcomes" the decision as it "confirms there is no legal 
requirement for the current travel restrictions."
Backed by Aer Lingus, formerly Ireland's state airline, Ryanair sued the government in July over travel guidelines it 
claimed were presented as "mandatory" and were imposed without parliamentary oversight.
Ruling that the guidelines are neither compulsory nor an abuse of power, Justice Garrett Simons said on Friday 
that "advice to avoid non-essential travel and to restrict movement on entry to the state is just that: advice."
According to the Department of the Taoiseach, or prime minister, anyone travelling from countries other than those 
on the government's "green list" are "requested" to "restrict their movements for 14 days" by "staying indoors in one 
location." 
The list of exempted countries is down to effectively three - Cyprus, Finland, Latvia. Liechtenstein, which does not 
have an airport, is also on the list, which was last changed in late September with the removal of Germany, Poland, 
Lithuania and Iceland.
The rules do not apply to Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK and where authorities on Friday announced a 
daily record of 934 cases of the coronavirus.
Ryanair has announced two 20-percent capacity cuts since August and on Friday repeated a warning that it will 
close two Irish bases, including in the second-biggest city Cork, unless the government ditches its list and "adopts 
the EU 'traffic light' system," which would exempt 15 countries from the self-isolation request.
Despite losing, Ryanair welcomes Irish court ruling on pandemic rules
"The Irish government needs to open back up," Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson told Dublin broadcaster Newstalk ahead 
of Friday's court ruling. 
Ryanair previously accused the government of keeping Ireland "locked up like North Korea."
Some of Ireland's domestic restrictions have dragged on for longer than elsewhere in Europe, with all pubs only 
allowed to reopen on September 21, and a ban on attending religious services reintroduced in Dublin after a recent 
rise in daily case numbers.
Official figures show 117 people in hospital after testing positive for the virus, an increase from 10 two months ago.
With travel slow to pick up after lockdowns were mostly ended across Europe in May and June, Ryanair said 
separately on Friday that its September traffic dropped by 64 per cent year-on-year, with only 5.1 million "guests" 
flying last month and only half of scheduled flights taking off.
Data collated by the World Tourism Organization, a United Nations agency, show tourism in Europe to be the 
second-worst hit after the Asia-Pacific by pandemic-related curbs.

Ryanair's claim that Ireland's pandemic-related travel measures are illegal was dismissed by the country's High 
Court on Friday.
Backed by the airline Aer Lingus, Ryanair had argued that the measures were imposed without parliamentary 
approval and were presented by the Irish government as "mandatory."
However the court ruled that the framework was neither mandatory nor an abuse of power.
"The advice to avoid non-essential travel and to restrict movement on entry to the state is just that: advice," said 
Justice Garrett Simons.
According to the Department of the Taoiseach, or prime minister, inbound travellers from countries other than those 
on the government's "Green List" are advised to "restrict their movements for 14 days" by "staying indoors in one 
location."
The list was on Monday cut to just Cyprus, Finland, Latvia and Liechtenstein.
With travel slow to pick up after lockdowns were mostly ended in Europe in June, Ryanair, the continent's biggest 
airline, said on Friday that September traffic dropped by 64 per cent, compared to last year, to 5.1 million guests. 
Only half of scheduled flights were operated.
On Thursday, Ryanair warned of the imminent closure of two Irish bases, including in the second-biggest city Cork, 
if the government did not align its rules with the rest of the European Union by October 13.
"The Irish government needs to open back up," Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson told broadcaster Newstalk ahead 
of Friday's court ruling.

Four low-cost airlines, including Ryanair, are facing an antitrust probe in Italy for failing to reimburse flights 
cancelled on account of the coronavirus pandemic.
The carriers offered vouchers rather than full refunds, in a "possible breach" of EU regulations on air passengers' 
rights, the Italian competition authority (AGCM) said in a statement on Friday.
Vueling, easyJet and Blue Panorama are the three other airlines targeted by AGCM's investigation.
The authority noted that even though the pandemic was given as the reason for cancellations, the flights in question 
were scheduled for after the end of Italy's lockdown period.
The airlines were also accused of failing to inform customers about their cancellation rights, and providing "onerous 
and poor" customer service via an expensive and "hard-to-reach" phone helpline.
ACGM said it launched similar investigations in July against two other airlines, Alitalia and Volotea.

International travel has plummeted during the pandemic, with nowhere worse affected than the Asia-Pacific region, 
data released by the United Nations tourism body showed on Thursday.
International tourist arrivals across the region dropped 72 per cent in 2020, according to data compiled by the World 
Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the worst decline seen around the world.
In the month of June, international tourist arrivals to the region plummeted 99 per cent year-on-year in the wake of 
pandemic era travel bans, UNWTO's new Tourism Recovery Tracker shows.
China, Japan and South Korea were worst hit by the drop in global travel, with North-East Asia seeing an 83 per 
cent drop in tourist arrivals as most countries prohibited all but essential travel.
South-East Asia, where countries remain largely closed to foreign tourists -  and some, such as Malaysia, have 
effectively barred citizens from leaving - saw arrivals fall by 64 per cent. 
Around 7 per cent of Malaysia's 2019 gross domestic product (GDP) was derived from international tourism. In 
neighbouring Thailand, that figure usually tops 10 per cent, whereas Cambodia's is nearer to 20.
Europe ranks as the second-worst hit region on the UNWTO tracker, registering a 66-per-cent decline in arrivals 
despite an uptick after many restrictions were eased in June.
The UNWTO last month slammed governments for "timid" efforts to revive tourism despite worldwide losses 
estimated at 460 billion dollars - equivalent to Austria's GDP - in the period to June alone.
Airlines have echoed UNWTO criticisms, with Ryanair, Europe's biggest carrier, last week saying pandemic-related 
travel rules had forced it to cut capacity by 20 per cent for the second time in two months.

International travel has plummeted during the pandemic, with nowhere worse affected than the Asia-Pacific region, 
according to United Nations tourism body data.
International arrivals across the Asia-Pacific have dropped 72 per cent so far in 2020, according to the data, which 
was compiled for the Madrid-based World Tourism Organization's (UNWTO) new Tourism Recovery Tracker.
The region's June arrivals were down 99 per cent year-on-year, a standstill that came after countries imposed strict 
lockdowns and holiday bans aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
China, Japan and South Korea were among the worst affected, with the UNWTO tracker showing an 83-per-cent 
drop in tourist arrivals across north-east Asia as most countries prohibited all but essential travel.
South-east Asia, where countries remain largely closed to foreign tourists - and some, such as Malaysia, have 
effectively barred citizens from leaving - saw arrivals fall by 64 per cent. 
Around 7 per cent of Malaysia's 2019 gross domestic product (GDP) was derived from international tourism. In 
neighbouring Thailand, that figure usually tops 10 per cent, whereas Cambodia's is nearer to 20.
Asian governments are now promoting internal travel in an attempt to shore up the sector, with Singapore earlier 
this month offering 100-dollar domestic tourism vouchers to residents.
Tony Fernandes, chief executive of Air Asia, one Asia's biggest low-cost airlines, said on Thursday that "our 
domestic routes like in Thailand and Malaysia, we are at about 70 per cent load capacity."
"Business travel, intercontinental travel, first-class travel is going to take longer to rebound," Fernandes said during 
a press conference in Kuala Lumpur.
Worst-hit by pandemic travel curbs, Asia sees domestic tourism grow
After the Asia-Pacific, Europe was the second worst-hit region, UNWTO data show. A 66-per-cent overall decline in 
arrivals was registered - though a revival began after restrictions were eased around the continent in June.
No region has seen tourism fall by less than half, the UNWTO tracker shows, with South America registering the 
least-worst performance to date with a 56 per cent decline.
The UNWTO last month slammed governments for their "timid" efforts to revive tourism, citing worldwide losses 
estimated at 460 billion dollars - equivalent to Austria's GDP - for the first half of 2020.

Ryanair said on Friday that it will slash capacity by 20 per cent in October, blaming coronavirus travel curbs 
introduced at short notice.
Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, said "EU government travel restrictions and policies" aimed at 
stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus "undermine consumers' willingness to make forward bookings."
Announcing its second 20 per cent capacity reduction since August, Ryanair accused the Irish government of 
keeping the country "locked up like North Korea" and of operating "a defective" quarantine system that 
means arrivals from most countries, some with lower infection rates than Ireland, are expected to self-isolate for 14 
days.
Supported by Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag carrier airline, Ryanair has taken the government to court over the curbs, 
which will not be aligned with EU guidelines until mid-October.
On Wednesday, lawyers representing the government told Ireland's High Court that the measures are not 
mandatory.
The government on Thursday cut Italy and Greece from its "green list" of countries from where arrivals are not 
expected to self-isolate but added Germany.

The European Commission gave its blessing on Friday to a grant worth just under 200 million euros (236 million 
dollars) from the Italian state for ailing flight company Alitalia to compensate damages arising from the coronavirus.
The measure is in line with the European Union's state aid rules, the bloc's executive arm - which acts as an 
antitrust watchdog - said in a press release.
"The aviation industry is one of the sectors that has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus outbreak," EU 
Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in the statement.
The size of the grant corresponds to losses sustained by the embattled company between March 1 and June 15 
due to Covid-19 restrictions, according to the commission, which added that the measure reflected the 
extraordinary circumstances and was proportionate.
"Our investigations into past support measures to Alitalia are ongoing and we are in contact with Italy on their plans 
and compliance with EU rules," Vestager said.
The commission is already looking into 900 million euros in loans granted by Italy to the company in 2017, and a 
separate loan of 400 million euros from 2019.
State support for hard-hit aviation companies during the pandemic has raised eyebrows among competing firms 
such as Ryanair, but also among environmentalists, who argue polluting industries should not be propped up.

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Monday said it plans to cut 20 per cent of regular flights in September and October after 
several European nations reimposed Covid-19 quarantine rules for arrivals.
The reduction in flight capacity comes after forward bookings "notably weakened over the last 10 days, given 
continuing uncertainty over recent Covid case rates in some EU countries," the airline said.
Most of the cuts will be reductions in frequency rather than suspension of routes, it said.
They will focus on countries including Spain, France, Sweden and Ireland.
Ireland has imposed a "uniquely restrictive Green List" that requires visitors from most other EU nations, including 
those with lower recent infection rates, Ryanair said.
"Proper testing at airports, and effective tracing - as is being conducted in Germany and Italy - is the only realistic 
and proportionate method of supervising safe intra-EU air travel while effectively limiting the spread of the Covid-19 
virus," a spokesperson said.
Britain, one of Ryanair's biggest markets, has reimposed a 14-day self-isolation requirement for arrivals from 
countries including Spain, France and Sweden.

The main airports in Amsterdam and Brussels are rolling out mobile coronavirus testing points for passengers in an 
effort to curb the pandemic.
In Amsterdam, passengers on some flights returning from countries deemed high risk in terms of infections can be 
tested for free as of Thursday.
This includes passengers without symptoms, the public health authority announced. The test results are to be 
available within 48 hours.
Testing capacity is currently limited at the Dutch airport, but the health authority plans to offer up to 600 tests a day 
as soon as possible, it said in a press release.
People are not required to undergo testing on returning to the Netherlands for legal reasons, the health authority 
said.
In a similar approach, Brussels Airport in neighbouring Belgium announced on Thursday that it would roll out mobile 
testing in early September.
Passengers returning from countries or areas designated as belonging to a red zone - meaning they are deemed 
high risk by the Belgian authorities - can be tested at the airport.
At the mobile testing stations, "passengers returning from a red zone can be tested immediately upon arrival at 
Brussels Airport," Arnaud Feist, who heads Brussels Airport Company, said in a press release.
Unlike in the Netherlands, people returning to Belgium from high-risk areas are required to undergo testing.
Amsterdam, Brussels airports introduce mobile coronavirus testing
Passengers returning from high-risk areas are to be charged 47 euros (56 dollars) for the virus test.
Departing passengers can also be tested, but would pay higher fees. Those undergoing standard testing, with the 
results available some nine hours later, would pay 67 euros. Faster testing is also to be offered, with the results 
available in three hours, for 135 euros.
Charleroi Airport, Brussels' second airport with flights mainly offered by Ryanair and Wizzair, has not announced 
similar measures.
More and more airports are offering mobile testing for the virus. While some places such as Singapore introduced 
testing for passengers with symptoms as early as March, Germany started offering tests free of charge for 
passengers on Saturday.
While international flights ground to a halt in March and April, Europe's summer holiday season has seen an 
increase in air travel - and a corresponding rise in the number of cases.

Brussels Airport will introduce mobile labs for coronavirus tests for passengers at the beginning of September, it 
announced on Thursday.
Passengers returning from a red zone - countries or regions that Belgium deems to carry a high risk for coronavirus 
infections - will be able to get tested at the airport.
"There passengers returning from a red zone can be tested immediately upon arrival at Brussels Airport," Arnaud 
Feist, the boss of Brussels Airport Company, said in a press release.
The test for arriving passengers that must be tested will cost about 47 euros (56 dollars).
Departing passengers can also get tested, albeit at a higher cost: 67 euros for a standard test for which results will 
be available within about 9 hours, or 135 euros for a rapid test with results being available within 3 hours.
Charleroi Airport, Brussels second airport that caters mainly to Ryanair and Wizzair, has not announced similar 
measures.

Low-cost Irish carrier Ryanair on Monday reported a first quarter net loss in a business period it said was "the most 
challenging in Ryanair's 35-year history," the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The net loss of 185 million euros (216 million dollars) in the April-to-June period, compared with a net profit of 243 
million euros in the corresponding period a year ago.
Revenue plunged 95 per cent to 125 million euros in the quarter that ended on June 30. Cost-saving measures 
could not offset the revenue loss. A year ago, the airline's revenues were 2.31 billion euros.
The company noted that more than 99 per cent of its fleet was grounded from mid-March to the end of June amid 
travel bans introduced across Europe due to the pandemic. It flew 500,000 passengers, compared to last year's 
41.5 million passengers. 
Ryanair on July 1 resumed flights across most of its route network, and expected demand to slowly rise in the 
coming months, saying it hoped to reach 70 per cent of its normal schedule in September.
The airline expected a "very challenging year," adding that "a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late 
autumn (when the annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now."
Ryanair also repeated recent criticism of various European government bailout schemes to flag carriers, including 
Alitalia, Air France/KLM, and Lufthansa.
The low-cast carrier, which has not received similar financial support, said the schemes "distort competition and 
allow unsustainable flag carriers to engage in below cost selling for many years to come."

The state-owned operator of Berlin's airports plans to cut 400 jobs, as the aviation industry reels from the effects of 
the coronavirus pandemic.
Significant cuts are necessary in the areas of administration and operations, according to a letter to employees 
seen by dpa on Wednesday.
"We estimate that 400 jobs will be cut in the next few years," airport chief Engelbert Luetke Daldrup and head of 
human resources Michael Halberstadt wrote.
The company currently employs around 2,170 people.
Dismissals for operational reasons are to be avoided "under all circumstances," the letter states, adding that senior 
executives and managing directors are to waive 10 per cent of their salary in a bid to cut costs.
Talks on job cuts are to get under way with the supervisory board, the works council and the Verdi union. A video 
conference is planned for Friday to give employees the opportunity to ask questions.
The Berlin airport operator, Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH, is not the only company in the air travel industry 
tightening its belt.
The operator of Frankfurt Airport, Germany's biggest air hub, expects to reduce its workforce of 22,500 by 3,000-
4,000 in the coming years.
Many airlines are also downsizing, including EasyJet, the biggest client for Berlin airports.
EasyJet intends to cut 30 per cent of its workforce worldwide and pull its aircraft out of Berlin.
Hundreds of job cuts planned at Berlin airports due to virus
On Tuesday, an internal memo seen by dpa said budget airline Ryanair plans to close its base at Frankfurt Hahn 
Airport and is considering doing the same in Berlin Tegel.
"Aviation and in turn airports are in the midst of the worst crisis in their history since World War II," the letter to 
Berlin airport employees said.
The German capital's two currently operating airports - a new one is scheduled to open after a long delay in 
October - are operating well below their usual capacity. Tegel and Schoenefeld airports have seen passenger 
numbers plummet to about 20-25 per cent of pre-crisis levels.

Budget airline Ryanair will shutter its base at Frankfurt Hahn Airport and is considering doing the same in Berlin 
Tegel and Weeze Airport near the Dutch border, Ryanair division Malta Air said in an internal memo seen by dpa on 
Tuesday.
The move comes after majority of German pilots voted against a proposed deal of savings including paycuts that 
Ryanair said were required because of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
"We must move on to deliver savings in other ways and adjust our German operations to tackle the unsustainable 
cost base at our German airports," the Malta Air memo said.
German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said late Tuesday that as many as 170 pilots could be affected by 
the decision, adding that negotiations with the airline had not been concluded.
The airline's British-based pilots accepted pay cuts of up to 20 per cent on July 8, with a similar deal announced in 
Ireland five days earlier.
Last week Ryanair announced it would cut "up to 1,000 flights" between Ireland and Britain during August and 
September, blaming the Irish government for its requirement that arrivals self-isolate for 14 days.
Described as Europe's largest airline, Ireland's Ryanair said in May that it would cut 3,000 jobs due to the 
pandemic, which has brought international travel to a near-standstill.
The virus has infected almost 15 million people and killed over 610,000, according to official figures collated by 
Johns Hopkins University.

A piece of paper that refereed to a bomb threat was found on a train about 60 kilometres north-east of Oslo, police 
in Norway said on Saturday.
The train, which was parked at a station in the municipality of Eidsvoll, was evacuated. Following a search, police 
found no evidence of any danger.
A similar threat occurred a day before on a Ryanair flight from London to the Norwegian capital.
The scare was prompted by a note found by crew on the flight. The plane landed safely, and a 51-year British 
citizen suspected of being behind the threat was arrested, but then later released.

Budget carrier Lauda is giving up its German hub in Stuttgart and will terminate the contracts of all employees there 
after a majority of pilots opposed wage reductions, according to a company document obtained by dpa on 
Thursday.
The loss-making subsidiary of Irish-based Ryanair plans to close this base after the summer travel season on 
October 30.
While nearly all co-pilots and flight attendants in Stuttgart had agreed to a new collective labour contract that was 
drawn up in reaction to the pandemic-related aviation crisis, less than half of the captains gave their approval, the 
document said.
"Since there are no positions available elsewhere, we will not be able to offer any crew transfers" to other hubs, 
Lauda's Vienna-based management said in the paper that was initially made public by Austrian newspaper Der 
Standard.
A negotiator for the German labour union Verdi, Sven Bergelin, said Lauda would hopefully reconsider and would 
enter into talks to save jobs.
"Pilots and cabin crews want to be treated fairly and want to continue their work under acceptable standards," he 
said in a statement.
While Stuttgart is to be shuttered, a majority of pilots, co-pilots and flight attendants have accepted wage cuts in 
Lauda's other German base in Dusseldorf. Those who did not agree face possible lay-offs, according to Verdi.
Ryanair and Lauda's management had also threatened to lay off all staff in Vienna, but employees there agreed to 
a new wage deal in early June after Austrian unionists had managed to negotiate better conditions.

More aeroplanes are flying in the skies above Europe as the air travel industry recovers from the coronavirus 
lockdown that almost brought it to its knees earlier in the year.
Over the course of the week ending on Sunday, the Eurocontrol organization for European aviation counted 90,549 
flights, up to 36.6 per cent of the levels seen during the same period last year.
Eurocontrol director general Eamonn Brennan spoke of "sustained traffic growth" in a tweet on Monday, noting that 
there was a rolling daily average of just under 13,000 flights.
That was 1,383 more than seen last week.
Irish budget airline Ryanair contributed significantly to the rise in traffic, offering on average 1,045 flights per day 
over the course of last week.

A Ryanair flight en route from Berlin to Athens had to make an unscheduled stop in Thessaloniki after a false fire 
alarm on Friday.
All passengers were well, according to Greek state radio ERT.
The pilot of the flight announced an emergency landing after a fire alarm went off in the cockpit while the aircraft 
was flying over the Greek port city of Thessaloniki.
An alarm was signalled at Thessaloniki airport and the plane landed without problems, the local news portal in the 
city reported.
The Irish airline Ryanair resumed around 40 per cent of its flights on July 1 after operating on a skeleton schedule 
since mid-March, due to the drop in demand and restrictions imposed from the coronavirus pandemic.

Low-cost airline easyJet on Tuesday said it had opened consultations on the closure of three British hubs and cuts 
of around 30 per cent in its staff.
The airline said it had begun talks with trade unions on cuts affecting "all of its UK-based pilots and crew," following 
an announcement last month that it could cut up to 4,500 of its 15,000 staff.
The proposals include closing three of easyJet's 11 airport hubs in Britain: Stansted and Southend, both close to 
London in south-eastern England; and Newcastle in the north-east.
The consultations are designed "with the aim of minimizing job losses as far as possible," it said, citing expectations 
that passenger demand will not recover to 2019 levels until 2023.
"These are very difficult proposals to put forward in what is an unprecedented and difficult time for the airline, and 
the industry as a whole," said Johan Lundgren, easyJet's chief executive.
"We are focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success so we can protect 
jobs going forward," Lundgren said.
Other British-based airlines have announced possible staff cuts, including 12,000 at British Airways and 3,000 at 
Ryanair.
An airport industry group also warned last week that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in Britain, with tens of 
thousands more at risk in businesses that indirectly depend upon airports.

Trade unions criticized low-cost airline easyJet on Tuesday as it opened consultations on the closure of three 
British hubs and cuts of around 30 per cent in its staff.
The airline said it had begun talks with trade unions on cuts affecting "all of its UK-based pilots and crew," following 
an announcement last month that it could cut up to 4,500 of its 15,000 staff.
The proposals include closing three of easyJet's 11 airport hubs in Britain: Stansted and Southend, both close to 
London in south-eastern England; and Newcastle in the north-east.
Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' trade union BALPA, accused the airline of "an excessive over-reaction" to 
the financial problems brought by the coronavirus pandemic.
Unite, which represents many easyJet cabin crew, said the announcement was a "massive blow."
EasyJet said the consultations are designed "with the aim of minimizing job losses as far as possible," citing 
expectations that passenger demand will not recover to 2019 levels until 2023.
"These are very difficult proposals to put forward in what is an unprecedented and difficult time for the airline, and 
the industry as a whole," said Johan Lundgren, easyJet's chief executive.
"We are focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success so we can protect 
jobs going forward," Lundgren said.
Oliver Richardson, a Unite national officer, said the cuts were "yet another massive blow to the aviation industry" 
and his thoughts are "with workers who face losing their jobs through no fault of their own."
Unions slam 'over-reaction' as easyJet opens talks on 4,500 job cuts
"There is no need for this announcement at this time, especially since easyJet has taken a multimillion-pounds 
government loan which it ought to be putting to use defending UK jobs," Richardson said.
Strutton said BALPA had been expecting easyJet to announce "temporary measures to help the airline through to 
recovery."
"But this seems an excessive over-reaction and easyJet won't find a supply of pilots waiting to come back when the 
recovery takes place over the next two years," he said.
"EasyJet paid 174 million pounds (214 million dollars) out to shareholders, got agreements to furlough staff to 
protect cash, got 600 million pounds from the government ... so why the panic?" Strutton asked.
"This is more evidence that aviation in the UK is caught in a death spiral of despair, and individual airlines are 
flailing around without direction," he said, urging the government to intervene in the industry.
Other British-based airlines have announced possible staff cuts, including 12,000 at British Airways and 3,000 at 
Ryanair.
An airport industry group also warned last week that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in Britain, with tens of

The German government will take a 20-per-cent stake in Germany's top air carrier, Lufthansa, clearing the way for 
9 billion euros (10 billion dollars) in state aid for the crisis-hit airline.
Shareholders approved the move on Thursday following a day of deliberations in which company executives asked 
for assistance to stay in business, after the coronavirus pandemic grounded the company.
Valued at around 300 million euros, that stake is only a small part of the total package - but it has irked investors, 
who will see their own shares diluted as a result of the state intervention. It has also angered competitors, who see 
a national champion being bailed out despite EU rules against just that.
"This is a spectacular case of a rich EU member state ignoring the EU treaties to the benefit of its national industry 
and the detriment of poorer countries," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement before the 
decision was announced.

An airport industry group on Wednesday said more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in Britain due to the economic 
impact the coronavirus pandemic, amid reports that Swissport plans to cut more than 4,000 jobs.
The Airport Operators' Association called for government help after its analysis suggested that 20,000 airport jobs 
are at risk in Britain "as the full effects of the [coronavirus] pandemic on the global airline community begin to be 
felt."
More than 110,000 jobs could be lost if firms providing services to airports or indirectly dependent upon them are 
included, the AOA said.
Trade unions and British media reported on Wednesday that Swissport has told staff that it plans consultations on 
cutting about half of its 9,000 jobs in Britain.
AOA chief executive Karen Dee said Britain's commercial aviation sector had "weathered the worst three months in 
its history."
Dee urged the government to drop its "arbitrary quarantine policy, which has unnecessarily stifled the sector's 
restart and recovery plans."
"These [AOA] jobs figures clearly show that a key component of the UK's infrastructure is on its knees, with no relief 
to the current crisis expected," she added.
The government has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international arrivals in Britain, which airlines warned 
could bring "economic disaster."

It later announced planned exemptions for arrivals from European nations popular with British holidaymakers, 
including Spain and Portugal.
Airlines said the government had effectively banned people from travelling to countries with lower coronavirus 
infection rates than Britain.
Broadcaster Sky News quoted a memo to Swissport's 8,500 staff in Britain and Ireland, from Jason Holt, its chief 
executive for Western Europe, as saying the company had to "adapt to this new reality" in which air traffic was not 
forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until as late as 2024.
Holt said Swissport, which provides baggage handling and other services at most British regional airports, planned 
to start consultations on the possible cutting of 4,556 positions.
Trade unions GMB and Unite, which represent many Swissport staff, said the plan to cut jobs was "devastating 
news."
The unions urged the government to provide "a bespoke financial package ... to support the aviation industry and 
save thousands of jobs as the economy continues to reopen."
Major British airlines have also announced possible staff cuts, including 12,000 at British Airways, 4,500 at easyJet 
and 3,000 at Ryanair.

Airport operator Swissport on Wednesday announced plans to cut more then 4,000 staff in Britain and Ireland, as 
an industry group warned that tens of thousands of airport-linked jobs are at risk following the coronavirus 
pandemic.
Jason Holt, chief executive for western Europe, told Swissport's 8,500 staff in Britain and Ireland that the company 
had to "adapt to this new reality" in which air traffic was not forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until as late 
as 2024.
Holt said in a memo that Swissport, which provides baggage handling and other services at most British regional 
airports, planned to start consultations on the possible cutting of 4,556 positions.
In a later statement, Holt said the pandemic had "hit [Swissport] hard, beginning with the collapse of [regional 
airline] Flybe back in March."
The company had lost about 75 per cent of its revenue during the pandemic, he said.
"We now must adapt to the unfortunate reality that there simply aren't enough aircraft flying for our business to 
continue running as it did before Covid-19; and there won't be for some time to come," Holt said.
"We expect upwards of 4,000 will leave us, comprising around 50 per cent of our workforce," he said, adding that 
the entire aviation industry is facing "very challenging, existential times."
The Airport Operators' Association (AOA) said its analysis suggested that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in 
Britain, or more than 110,000 jobs if firms providing services to airports or indirectly dependent upon them are 
included.

Only 30 per cent of voters are satisfied with the British government's response to the coronavirus pandemic, which 
has seen the country record Europe's highest death toll, according to a poll published on Sunday.
The Opinium poll for The Observer found that "discontent at the government's corona handling continues to steadily 
rise," reaching a high of 48 per cent, while approval of the government's approach fell from 34 per cent earlier this 
month.
"This gives the government a net approval rating of minus 18 in responding to one of the greatest threats this 
country has faced," Opinium said.
In another poll published by ORB International on Friday, 52 per cent disagreed with the statement that the 
government was "handling the coronavirus well," while 40 per cent agreed with it.
Britain's official death toll linked to the coronavirus pandemic is more than 40,000, but health data analysts estimate 
the true death toll at up to 70,000, based on seasonal excess deaths.
Health experts and opposition politicians have accused Johnson's government of a slow response to the crisis, and 
criticized Britain's low level of testing and poor preparation for a pandemic.
Johnson is also under pressure from critics who want him to lift Britain's lockdown more quickly to reduce the 
anticipated severe economic impact.
British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet launched legal action on Friday against his requirement for all international 
arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days to curb the spread of coronavirus, warning that it will have "a devastating effect" 
on the economy.

Three major airlines launched legal action on Friday against the British government's requirement for all 
international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days to curb the spread of coronavirus.
British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet demanded an urgent judicial review of the quarantine rule, which will have "a 
devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy and destroy thousands of jobs."
"The airlines have not yet seen any evidence on how and when proposed 'air bridges' between the UK and other 
countries will be implemented," they wrote in a joint statement.
The "air bridges" would create exemptions allowing tourists to return from countries such as Spain, Portugal and 
Greece without needing to self-isolate.
Ireland is currently the only nation exempt from the quarantine rule, which the government imposed on Monday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the measure, initially only in place until June 28, was necessary so that "those 
arriving from abroad ... don't unknowingly spread the virus."
The airlines urged the government to switch back to a previous rule requiring quarantine for arrivals from "high risk" 
countries, "bringing the UK in line with much of Europe, which is opening its borders mid-June."
They said there was "no consultation and no scientific evidence provided for such a severe policy," adding that the 
government was effectively banning people from travelling to countries with lower coronavirus infection rates than 
Britain.
Britain has reported Europe's highest total of deaths of people infected with coronavirus, at about 41,000. Its 
estimated infection rate remains higher than in most European nations.

Airlines threaten legal action as all arrivals to Britain must self-isolate for 14 days to curb the spread of coronavirus 
starting on Monday.
Michael O'Leary, group chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, said "millions of jobs" could be lost as a result of 
the quarantine rule, which applies to arrivals, including British citizens, from all countries except Ireland.
Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the quarantine requirement, initially until June 28, was necessary 
so that "those arriving from abroad ... don't unknowingly spread the virus."
Britain has reported Europe's highest death toll linked to the coronavirus pandemic and its estimated infection rate 
remains higher than in most European nations.
"We have got the situation where - weeks ago - other countries put quarantine in and we didn't. Now, as 
everybody's lifting it, we're putting it in," opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer told London radio station LBC.
Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways owner IAG wrote to the government threatening legal action to stop the 
"disproportionate and unfair" measure, warning that it would have "a devastating effect on UK's tourism industry."
"We're seeing thousands of British families booking their holidays in Portugal, in Spain and Italy, but there's almost 
a collapse of inward bookings ... bringing those Europeans here to the UK, on which Britain's tourism industry 
depends," O'Leary told broadcaster ITV.
"What's irrational about it is all of those countries have a much lower Covid rate than the UK," he added.

British travel firms called for an urgent "roadmap" for the resumption of tourism as the government imposed 
quarantine rules on all international arrivals from Monday.
Mark Tanzer, chief executive of travel trade association ABTA, said the quarantine plan to prevent the spread of the 
coronavirus would affect the British economy "beyond the wider transport and tourism industries."
"We must restart international travel as soon as it is safe to do so, and businesses and customers would benefit 
from the government outlining when this is likely to happen," Tanzer said.
"There are many livelihoods at stake, and bookings will only start to pick up in earnest when people and businesses 
have a better idea as to what the government's plan is to open up the UK and access to international destinations."
Three major British-based airlines earlier threatened legal action over the requirement for all arrivals to Britain to 
self-isolate for 14 days.
Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways owner IAG wrote to the government demanding the end of the 
"disproportionate and unfair" measure, warning that it would have "a devastating effect on UK's tourism industry."

so that "those arriving from abroad ... don't unknowingly spread the virus."
Britain has reported Europe's highest death toll of more than 40,000 linked to the coronavirus pandemic and its 
estimated infection rate remains higher than in most European nations.

"We have got the situation where - weeks ago - other countries put quarantine in and we didn't. Now, as 
everybody's lifting it, we're putting it in," opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer told London radio station LBC.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock rejected the idea that the government had been forced into a "trade-off" between 
damage to the economy and the impact of the pandemic on health.
"If we don't have control of this virus then the economy will suffer yet more," Hancock told reporters.
"For those who aren't able to go abroad for a holiday, I know the impact that that will have this summer," he said.
"I just hope that we will be able to get to a position where people will be able to go on holiday - including 
domestically - safely, carefully and in a Covid-secure way."

Budget airline Ryanair will not carry out its plan to shutter its loss-making subsidiary Lauda in Vienna, the Austrian 
carrier announced on Monday after employees agreed to a last-minute wage deal.
The management of Ireland-based Ryanair had set several deadlines for Lauda staff to agree to wage cuts and 
threatened to cut all 500 job at the Lauda base in Vienna as the subsidiary would be moved to a new hub.
However, unionists blocked Ryanair's proposal, arguing that the new entry-level wages were below the poverty line.
After union representatives and Austria's chamber of commerce agreed on a new wage cut deal last week, Lauda 
staff approved it in a poll on the weekend.
However, some jobs will be cut, and the number of Lauda's Airbus aircraft in Vienna will be reduced from 16 to 10, 
the Austrian low-cost carrier said in a statement.
"We will need these cost efficiencies if we are to successfully compete against the state subsidised Lufthansa 
subsidiary," Lauda chief executives Andreas Gruber and David O'Brien said, in a stab against the government 
bailout of Austrian Airlines.
The Lauda fleet that was grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic will gradually start flying again on July 1.

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Tuesday slammed a bailout plan for German rival Lufthansa, saying it "distorts 
competition" with other airlines across Europe.
The criticism came the day after the German government and Lufthansa said they had agreed on a deal providing 
aid and equity measures worth 9 billion euros (9.8 billion dollars).
The deal was yet to be approved by Lufthansa's supervisory board and the European Commission's competition 
watchdog.
The status of some 138,000 employed by the airline and its many subsidiaries, including Austrian and Brussels, 
was a major factor.
Ryanair claimed the move would "further strengthen Lufthansa's monopoly-like grip on the German air travel 
market."
Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary said it was "deeply ironic that the German government, which 
lectures all other EU countries about respecting EU rules, has no difficulty breaking the state aid rules when it 
comes to Lufthansa."
Ryanair will "appeal against this latest example of illegal state aid to Lufthansa," he added.
Germany has not yet officially notified the EU executive branch about the Lufthansa deal, a spokesperson for the 
European Commission said on Tuesday, declining to make any specific comment on the case.
In general, large recapitalizations of more than 250 million euros comes with stricter conditions than other state aid 
initiatives, Arianna Podesta said.
Meanwhile, Bavarian state premier Markus Soeder warned against making too many concessions for EU approval.

If Lufthansa were to be forced to give up airport slots in the main cities of Frankfurt and Munich to other airlines, it 
would be an "incomprehensible constraint," he said in Munich.

Ryanair subsidiary Lauda is to close its base at Vienna's airport following a dispute with a trade union, the company 
said on Friday.
Some 300 jobs will be affected, the airline said. It had recently given the Vida union an ultimatum to sign a new 
collective agreement with significant wage cuts for employees due to the coronavirus crisis.
As the union refused, the base will be closed on May 29, the statement said.
"In a shameful way, the union Vida ignored the wishes of more than 95 per cent of the pilots and 70 per cent of the 
cabin crew at Lauda's A320 base in Vienna and destroyed more than 300 well-paid jobs," Lauda bosses Andreas 
Gruber and David O'Brien were quoted as saying.
Vida on the other hand described Ryanair and Austria's Economic Chamber as "gravediggers" of living wages. The 
chamber had spoken out in favour of signing the wage deal.
According to the airline, the new agreement would have given junior cabin crew an average annual income of 
24,450 euros (26,650 dollars), a captain would have earned about 117,000 euros. Vida talked about a monthly net 
wage of 848 euros for newly hired flight attendants.
The Vienna base is by far the largest base of the Ryanair subsidiary, which currently has a fleet of 26 aircraft. The 
aircraft are grounded due to the pandemic.

Berlin to close Tegel Airport on June 15, perhaps for good
Berlin to close Tegel Airport on June 15, perhaps for good

Berlin's Tegel Airport is unlikely to survive the coronavirus pandemic, after the operator decided at a meeting on 
Wednesday to close the ageing facility provisionally from June 15, a city finance ministry spokeswoman said.
It is unclear whether the airport will ever reopen. It had already been set for closure towards the end of the year, as 
the German capital prepares for the long-delayed launch of its new BER Airport.
Following Paris' example - Orly Airport was closed on April 1 and flights moved to Charles de Gaulles - Berlin's 
most centrally located and until now busiest airport will be taken offline for two months if passenger numbers don't 
drastically improve in the coming weeks.
Berlin's meagre air traffic will then be consolidated to Schoenefeld Airport, on the capital's south-eastern outskirts.
Last year, over 24 million people flew via Tegel in the city's north-west, making it Germany's fourth-busiest aviation 
hub after Frankfurt, Munich and Dusseldorf before the crisis. Schoenefeld served over 11 million people last year.
But the novel coronavirus outbreak and resulting global travel restrictions caused a steep fall in demand. Recently, 
Berlin's two functioning airports have been flying around 2,000 passengers per day - a tiny fraction of the usual 
capacity.
The coronavirus-induced closure from June is likely to be the end for Tegel Airport, given that reopening for a mere 
matter of months before BER comes online is considered unlikely.
"If I had 50,000 guests, Tegel would go back online immediately," said Engelbert Luetke Daldrup, chief executive of 
the Berlin Brandenburg Airport operator.
"But to be honest, I am not very optimistic that we will be back up to 50,000 guests in a few months."
Berlin to close Tegel Airport on June 15, perhaps for good
Nine years late and beset by a string of scandals, the new BER airport is set to open on a plot adjacent to 
Schoenefeld on October 31. Under the current plans, Tegel is to close for good a week later.
The move to close Tegel prematurely next month was met with criticism from Germany's flagship airline.
"Such a last-minute change of location is complex and costly," a spokeswoman for the Lufthansa Group said.
"In the current crisis, which already poses an enormous challenge to us, this is a further strain."
Lufthansa operates flights from Tegel to its hubs in Munich and Frankfurt.
Subsidiary Eurowings maintains a base at Tegel and is one of the Berlin airport operator's biggest clients, alongside 
Easyjet and Ryanair.

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Tuesday said it plans to restore 40 per cent of its regular flights from July 1, subject to 
the lifting of Covid-19-related restrictions on flights within the European Union.
Ryanair said it also requires "effective public health measures" to be implemented at airports before it begins a daily 
schedule of about 1,000 flights, restoring 90-percent of its routes.
The airline said it is currently operating only 30 flights on a "skeleton daily schedule," after governments across 
Europe imposed social distancing measures and severe restrictions on international travel.
Ryanair said it plans to resume operations at most of its 80 bases in Europe but will operate fewer flights on its 
major routes.
It said it will change ticketing, check-in and baggage services to improve social distancing and reduce the risk of 
spreading the novel coronavirus.
The airline said it wants passengers to undergo temperature checks at airport entrances and wear face masks at all 
times, including during the flights.
"After four months [of lockdown], it is time to get Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow 
people to return to work, and restart Europe's tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs," said Eddie 
Wilson, Ryanair's chief executive.
Ryanair group head Michael O'Leary told the BBC that a 14-day quarantine requirement for arrivals to Britain, 
where the airline does much of its business, was "unimplementable and unenforceable."

Germany's Lufthansa is to roughly double its schedule in June, putting 160 planes into the air to carry passengers 
to 106 domestic and foreign destinations, the airline announced from its Frankfurt headquarters on Friday.
Lufthansa, along with its subsidiaries Swiss and Eurowings, will include many traditional holiday destinations in the 
schedule, including Crete and Majorca in the Mediterranean and Sylt and Rostock on the northern German 
coastline.
Around 600 planes that belong to the group will remain grounded.
On Thursday, the Lufthansa Group, Europe's second largest airline after Ryanair, confirmed that it was in talks with 
the German government regarding a bailout package of 9 billion euros (9.7 billion dollars).  
In exchange for the stabilization package, the government has proposed taking a stake in the company of up to 25 
per cent plus one share, the airline stated in a regulatory release, as well as one seat on the supervisory board.

Airline after airline across the globe is reporting drastic falls in passengers and revenue amid the coronavirus 
pandemic that has brought domestic and international air travel to a virtual standstill. Businesses and governments 
are just coming to terms with the true costs of saving them.
The global air travel industry had been expected to grow by more than 3 per cent this year, but that was prior to the 
standstill caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Instead of demand for global passenger seats growing by 67 million passengers in 2020, the International Civil 
Aviation Authority (ICAO) estimates that demand will drop by between 805 million and almost 1.5 billion passenger 
seats as country after country introduces travel bans to stem the spread of the virus.
Europe is particularly hard-hit, the UN body said. Travel restrictions are expected to cripple the traditionally busy 
summer travel season.
Millions of jobs hang in the balance warns the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 
about 290 airlines. According to IATA, the aviation industry supports 65.5 million jobs around the world, including 
10.5 million people who work at airports and airlines.
Airline after airline has presented dismal quarterly reports and plans to cut jobs. 
Airlines, governments weigh costs as pandemic keeps planes idling
That includes Virgin Atlantic, which this week said 3,150 jobs could go. Chief executive Shai Weiss said the airline 
was forced to cut costs to "safeguard [its] future and emerge a sustainably profitable business" by next year.
Last week, British Airways announced plans for up to 12,000 redundancies, while low-cost carrier Ryanair warned 
that it could cut up to 3,000 jobs.
Normal services are not expected to resume any time soon.
The owner of British Airways said on Thursday it expects the impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry to last 
at least three years, with no "meaningful return" to normal services until July at the earliest.
IATA this week warned that leaving middle seats free to reduce infection risk would either lead to soaring ticket 
prices or to bankrupt airlines. Such measures would push the maximum passenger load in aircraft below the break-
even level of 77 per cent, according to the industry umbrella group.
"Eliminating the middle seat will raise costs. If that can be offset with higher fares, the era of affordable travel will 
come to an end," IATA chief Alexandre de Juniac said.
IATA's safety proposals include temperature screenings, safe boarding procedures and increased aircraft cleaning.
John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, told British lawmakers on Wednesday that the 
government needs to agree on common international standards by the end of May, especially with the EU and the 
US.
"The key issue [for passengers] is whether they will be allowed into the country that they will be going to, and 
whether they will be allowed back," Holland-Kaye said, adding that continuing quarantine will "kill the [aviation] 
industry."
Airlines across Europe have also sought and received state support, including loans and credits to weather the 
storm. 
The Polish government was on Thursday among the latest to announce plans to back LOT, the country's flagship 
airline.  
"The interventions of the various national states, aimed at safeguarding individual flag carriers, have a perverse 
effect, which is to distort the market. There should be aid for the industry, but it must be coordinated by the 
European Union," wrote Andrea Giuricin, an Italian airline analyst, in the Il Foglio daily.
Some carriers were already in trouble before the standstill, having racked up huge debts. Those include low-cost 
Norwegian Air and its expansion plans or Italy's near-bankrupt Alitalia, which saw revenue in the April 1-23 period 
fall by 97 per cent.
Carsten Spohr, head of airline German Lufthansa, Europe's largest carrier, this week warned against incurring high 
debts amid negotiations about a huge state bailout.
German airports are losing half a billion euros (539.2 million dollars) in revenue every month due to the coronavirus 
crisis, an industry body warned on Thursday, calling for state aid.
"Air travel does not happen without the infrastructure on the ground," Stefan Schulte, president of the ADV airport 
association, said.
The European Commission this week approved French loans worth 7 billion euros to help Air France, noting that 
the aviation giant would otherwise face the risk of bankruptcy.
French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said Paris wanted environmental commitments from Air France - part of 
the Air France-KLM group - in return for the backing.

"When you can travel by train in less than two and a half hours, there is no justification for taking a plane," he said.
The trend with growing state involvement was "interesting" as it marked a shift from previous privatization waves, 
said Jean-Marie Skoglund, senior advisor with the Swedish Transport Agency.
He added that, when air travel eventually resumes, it was "important that the same restrictions apply for all airlines, 
at least within tbe EU."
Scandinavian airline SAS also received the EU executive's blessing for a three-year credit guarantee for 335 million 
dollars, mainly guaranteed by its main shareholders - the Swedish and Danish governments.
Sweden, however, did not wish to use the funding to target a single company, Tomas Eneroth, minister of 
infrastructure, told Stockholm daily Dagens Nyheter.
He said the airline sector as a whole should become more environmentally friendly. Possible measures include 
promoting bio fuel and investments in electric-powered aircraft. 
Meanwhile, Greenpeace and pressure groups like Transport & Environment that track emissions generated by air 
travel have called for governments to use state support as leverage. 
"Injecting taxpayers' money into one of the world's most polluting industries - with no strings attached - makes no 
sense at all," said Lorelei Limousin, Greenpeace EU climate campaigner.

Virgin Atlantic to cut 3,150 jobs as airlines face 'death spiral'
Virgin Atlantic to cut 3,150 jobs as airlines face 'death spiral'

Virgin Atlantic airline announced plans to cut 3,150 jobs on Tuesday, in the latest blow to an industry rocked by the 
severe impact of global efforts to curb the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss said the airline was forced to cut costs to "safeguard [its] future and 
emerge a sustainably profitable business" by next year.
"This will mean taking steps to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic in line with demand," Weiss said in a statement.
"We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years ago, but none has been as devastating as Covid-19 
and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many," he said.
Virgin's move followed British Airways' announcement last week of plans for up to 12,000 redundancies, and a 
warning from low-cost carrier Ryanair that it could cut up to 3,000 jobs.
"Why is the government sitting on its hands while aviation plunges further towards a death spiral?" Brian Strutton, 
general secretary of pilots' trade union BALPA, said following Virgin's announcement.
BALPA wrote an open letter to the government on Monday, calling for urgent action to mitigate the "crisis in 
aviation."
Weiss noted that Virgin had taken similar action after the "9/11" terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001 and 
the 2008 global financial crisis, but many redundant staff were "back flying with us within a couple of years."
Virgin group founder Richard Branson warned last month that the airline needed government loans to keep 
operating.

Low-cost Irish carrier Ryanair warned on Friday that it could cut up to 3,000 jobs, as global efforts to curb the novel 
coronavirus pandemic continue to have a severe impact on airlines.
Ryanair said it plans talks with trade unions on a "restructuring and job loss programme" to be launched in July.
It said the cost-cutting programme "may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid 
leave, and pay cuts of up to 20 per cent, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic 
recovers."
Ryanair's head office staff and support teams will also be subject to job cuts and pay cuts, the airline said.
Ryanair expects to operate just 1 per cent of its flight programme from April to June, and a maximum of 50 per cent 
of flights in its July to September financial quarter.
"As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least 
July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and 
pricing will take at least two years," it said.
Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary has agreed to a 50-per-cent salary reduction until March, it added.
The owner of British Airways announced plans on Tuesday for up to 12,000 redundancies.
BA has written to staff warning that it might not resume operations at Britain's second-busiest airport, Gatwick, the 
Financial Times reported on Thursday.

Several major European airlines on Monday said they would reduce their flights by up to 90 per cent amid the sharp 
fall in demand for air travel over the coronavirus pandemic.
Air France-KLM noted that "some countries have imposed constraints on the movement of travellers from France, 
the Netherlands or more broadly from Europe," affecting travel opportunities.
Air France would ground its Airbus 380 fleet, while KLM was to ground its Boeing 747 fleet.
The airline said it would reduce the number of available seat kilometres (ASK) - a measure for passenger carrying 
capacity - by 75 to 90 per cent in the coming two months.
Talks were also to open with employee representatives due to the "expected decline in activity."
Air France-KLM Group welcomed statements by the French and Dutch governments on means to support the 
group.
The parent company of British Airways, IAG, said it would reduce capacity in April and May by at least 75 per cent.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said he expected demand to "remain weak until well into the summer."
"We will continue to monitor demand levels and we have the flexibility to make further cuts if necessary," Walsh 
said.
Low-cost airline easyJet said it has made "further significant cancellations."
European airlines slash flights by 90 per cent as demand nosedives
The suspension of flights "will continue on a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding 
of the majority of the easyJet fleet," the airline said.
"European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that coordinated government backing will be required to 
ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over," said easyJet CEO Johan 
Lundgren.
Budget carrier Ryanair also said it expected to ground most of its fleet across Europe over the next seven to 10 
days.
"For April and May, Ryanair now expects to reduce its seat capacity by up to 80 per cent, and a full grounding of the 
fleet cannot be ruled out," it said.
German holiday airline Condor meanwhile said that is has cancelled a number of flights to favourite tourist 
destinations to which German citizens are no longer allowed to travel.
Flights to the United States, the Dominican Republic, Turkey and Morocco are affected, to varying degrees. Condor 
is to send empty planes to affected destinations in the next few days to bring back holidaymakers.
"We'll fly empty to Turkey to bring the people back home," a Condor spokeswoman said in Frankfurt, adding that 
the airline was in close cooperation with travel agents who have cancelled a large number of package holidays.
Finnish flag carrier Finnair said it will slash its capacity by 90 per cent from April 1. As of Monday until end of March 
up to 2,000 flights would be cancelled.
The airline aimed to "maintain the most critical air connections for Finland also in this exceptional situation," said 
Topi Manner, chief executive.
Scandinavian carrier SAS said Sunday it would temporarily lay off 90 per cent of its staff, about 10,00 employees, 
and halt most of its flights.
Last week the Lufthansa Group - whose airlines include Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Eurowings and Brussels - 
announced services would be cut worldwide by up to half of the average of 3,200 flights a day.
Lufthansa said it was in talks with several European governments about state support to help it through the air 
travel crisis.

Three airline alliances that group almost 60 carriers called on Monday for governments to come to the aviation 
sector's rescue, while a growing number of airlines announced drastic flight reductions due to plummeting air travel 
demand over the coronavirus pandemic.
Governments must consider "all possible means" to aid the airline industry that is suffering from the coronavirus 
crisis, the airline alliances Oneworld, SkyTeam and Star Alliance said in a joint statement.
The three groups account for more than half of the global market. They said the current industry forecast of 113 
billion dollars in lost revenues this year is still too optimistic, given the most recent US restrictions for European 
travellers.
The Lufthansa Group announced further reductions to its already stripped-back service, under which just one in 10 
long-haul flights will now operate and one in five short and medium-haul flights.
The German airline says it will continue running flights to bring holidaymakers back to their home country. Together 
with its Eurowings subsidiary, Lufthansa returned around 6,000 passengers with more than 20 flights at the 
weekend.
"Now it is no longer about the economic issues, but rather the responsibility which airlines carry as part of the 
critical infrastructure in their home countries," Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said.
Last week the group - whose airlines include Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Eurowings and Brussels - announced 
services would be cut worldwide by up to half of the average of 3,200 flights a day.
Meanwhile, Lufthansa Cargo said it has successfully been able to continue operating cargo flights amid the crisis.

situation," said Topi Manner, chief executive.
Norwegian Air said on Monday it would cancel most flights and temporarily lay off about 90 per cent of its staff, 
about 7,300 employees, over "stagnating demand and enforced travel restrictions."
SAS said on Sunday it would temporarily lay off 90 per cent of its staff, about 10,00 employees, and halt most of its 
flights.

European countries attempted to block a severe coronavirus outbreak in Italy from spreading any further on 
Tuesday with travel bans and warnings, as they introduced ever stricter measures to contain their own domestic 
epidemics.
Speaking during a video conference of European Union leaders late on Tuesday, European Council President 
Charles Michel urged the continent to coordinate its response to the crisis.
"The virus is spreading in all member states," said Michel. "I think therefore we should try to coordinate as much as 
possible and see where we can do more together."
His remarks were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday evening, who tweeted that Europe 
should prevent instability and do everything necessary to protect people's health and the economy.
Their comments came as the World Trade Organization cancelled all meetings through March 20 after learning that 
one of its employees has become infected with the new coronavirus.
As the virus spreads, multiple countries - including Austria, Malta, Serbia and Spain - banned flights from Italy, 
which has seen by the worst outbreak in Europe, with more than 460 deaths and has gone into nationwide 
lockdown.
Denmark said it had banned flights from badly affected areas, including parts of Italy, while Austrian Airlines 
stopped flights to the northern Italian cities of Venice, Milan and Bologna.

Serbia, which now has five confirmed cases, on Tuesday refused to permit 10 travellers to disembark from their 
plane from Bergamo and returned them to Italy. Croatia, with 14 cases, said it would quarantine all arrivals from 
Italy.
Spain raised its own concerns after registering a sharp jump in cases to 1,600, up 400 from the day before, and 
announced it would close its parliament until further notice.
The virus has now been reported in all 27 member states. France confirmed 372 new coronavirus cases in the last 
24 hours, taking the total to 1,784, with 33 deaths. Britain confirmed an additional 54 cases, taking the country's 
total to 373, including six deaths.
Nadine Dorries, Britain's minister for patient safety, suicide prevention and mental health, also tested positive to the 
virus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
Swiss authorities confirmed the number of cases in the country rose to 476, an increase of 52 per cent on the 
previous day.
A German woman on vacation in Northern Cyprus was diagnosed with coronavirus, state news agency Anadolu 
reported, the first such case in the Turkish-administered part of the divided island.
Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca also confirmed the first case in Turkey on Tuesday night, saying that a male 
citizen who recently returned from Europe tested positive, according to Anadolu.
Airlines joined the efforts to limit the spread from Italy, with British Airways announcing it was cancelling all 
Tuesday's flights to and from the country.
Other airlines went one step further, with Ryanair suspending flights to and from Italy until April 8 and Air France 
and Easyjet until April 3.
Airlines have been badly hit by travel bans, with Norwegian the latest to announce flight cancellations. The carrier 
said it was cancelling an estimated 3,000 flights until mid-June - about 15 per cent of its flying capacity.
On the Spanish island of Mallorca, hoteliers said they were eyeing a dramatic slump in Easter bookings with 
concern.
Germany confirmed on Tuesday that the virus had reached all 16 of its federal states, after authorities in Saxony-
Anhalt announced their first infections.
The outbreak originated in central China in December and has spread rapidly, with about 110,000 people infected 
worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, of which over 3,800 have died.
Throughout Europe, cultural and sporting life ground to a standstill in more places, as Poland and Slovakia joined 
Italy in banning all sports and cultural events. Austria and the Czech Republic stopped all indoor events with more 
than 100 participants.
Slovakia's measures are in place for 14 days, whereas the ban in Poland did not have an end date, and spans 
professional football games and concerts, among others. However, theatres, opera houses, philharmonic concert 
halls or art galleries are exempt.
Pop star Madonna announced she was cancelling two Paris concerts on March 10 and 11 after the French 
government banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people.
Berlin's Senate said it was cancelling all state-owned theatre, opera and concert events until the end of the Easter 
break.
In the Vatican, St Peter's Square and St Peter's Basilica have been closed to the public due to the crisis.

Greece is set to temporarily close its schools. In Poland, several universities cancelled classes and other events 
while President Andrzej Duda said he would refrain from organising large gatherings as he campaigned ahead of 
May's election.

EU executive probes France 's Beziers airport over competition rules

The European Commission opened an investigation on Monday into France's regional Beziers airport on suspicion 
that its operators had breached EU competition rules.
Beziers airport, in the southern French region of Occitane, served more than 250,000 passengers last year, 
according to the commission.
The airport operations changed hands in 2011 from the local chamber of commerce to a syndicate composed of 
local and regional public authorities.
The commission - which acts as the European Union's competition watchdog - received a complaint about public 
funds granted to the successive operators from 2007 until now, as well as deals they struck with Ryanair.
The operational aid may have granted Beziers airport an unfair competitive benefit, while the agreements with 
Ryanair may have given it "an undue economic advantage vis-a-vis its competitors that might amount to 
incompatible aid," the commission wrote.
The EU executive has investigated several funding arrangements aimed at keeping airlines operating at certain 
regional airports, cracking down in recent years on schemes in France, Germany, Austria and Italy.
In 2018, meanwhile, French authorities impounded a Ryanair plane to recoup state aid to the airline that Brussels 
had found to be illegal.

Against the steady rise of infections, European businesses and governments on Monday sought ways to control the 
spread of the coronavirus.
The risk level for people in the European Union due to the spreading coronavirus has been raised from low-to-
moderate to moderate-to-high in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's latest assessment, 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Brussels.
The European Commission launched a coronavirus response team on Monday, scrutinizing medical risks as well as 
the implications for transport and mobility in the European Union, and the bloc's economy.
"While we should not give in to panic, the situation is likely to still get worse," EU Crisis Management Commissioner 
Janez Lenarcic said at a Brussels press conference on Monday.
Early on Monday, 2,100 cases had been confirmed in the 18 EU member states, with 38 deaths, EU Health 
Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said.
Eighteen EU states have launched a joint procurement process to buy protective equipment, she added.
No EU country has so far indicated plans to introduce border checks within the Schengen free movement area.
EU finance ministers are to discuss the situation in a teleconference, Eurogroup president Mario Centeno said on 
Monday, to review recent developments and coordinate national responses.

Nevertheless, some businesses took things into their own hands.
British Airways cancelled hundreds of flights to Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Ireland and Switzerland, between 
March 17 to 28, citing the outbreak.
Ryanair also scaled back flights to Italy between March 17 and April 8.
Lufthansa and its subsidiaries likewise reduced flights to Italian and Asian destinations, the Frankfurt-based airline 
said on Monday.
Lufthansa and its subsidiaries, Swiss and Austrian Airlines, have already cancelled all flights to and from Chinese 
mainland destinations. The new move is a reaction to the spread of the virus and affects flights scheduled for March 
and April to Italy, Hong Kong and South Korea.
Flights to mainland China have been cancelled until April 24 and to Tehran until April 30.
LATAM Airlines Brasil also decided to suspend flights between Sao Paulo and Milan from March 2 to April 16.
The number of cases also continued to tick up. Portugal became the latest country to report its first case.
In Germany, cases rose to 150, the official disease control institute reported on Monday.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates the risk of the epidemic to be "moderate." Its head, Lothar Wieler, noted the 
situation continued to be extremely dynamic.
In the southern states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria, pupils were ordered to stay home from school after last 
week's Carnival holiday if they had been in a high-risk area.
Several public events have been cancelled, most recently Munich's international craft trades fair (IHM). The federal 
government said it did not believe the epidemic would end soon.
In France, the Paris book fair was cancelled due to government restrictions on indoor events involving more than 
5,000 people.
In Italy, the first coronavirus case linked to the current outbreak was reported in Rome, affecting a policeman who 
came into contact with someone from Lombardy.
Italy now has 2,036 infections, a 20-per-cent increase compared to the previous day, the Italian Civil Protection 
Agency said. The new figure includes 52 dead and 149 recoveries - up from 34 and 83 on Sunday - and 908 
patients in hospital, with 166 in intensive care.
The outbreak remains concentrated in northern Italy, with 1,077 cases in Lombardy, 324 in Emilia-Romagna, 271 in 
Veneto, 51 in Piedmont and 34 in the Marche.
In the Nordic region, the number of reported coronavirus cases increased with four in Denmark, seven in Finland, 
three in Iceland, 25 in Norway and 15 in Sweden on Monday evening.
The king and queen of Sweden postponed an official dinner this week due to the cases, the palace said on 
Monday.
The Swedish Foreign Ministry advised against all travel to Iran, also on Monday.
And after a government meeting addressing the outbreak, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven cancelled a visit to 
South Africa.
France has now confirmed 191 cases of coronavirus infection, up 61 from Sunday, national health director Jerome 
Salomon said.
Virus figures keep ticking up as Europe seeks ways to control spread
In Austria, Viennese authorities set up a quarantine area for tourists infected with the virus, but with milder 
symptoms than would require a hospital stay, although no one yet fulfils this criterion.
In Poland, where no cases have been confirmed, a special parliamentary session was convened so lawmakers 
could discuss measures to allow firms to order their employees to work remotely, and exempt from rules of public 
tender the purchase of medical equipment. The bill would also broaden the prerogatives of the country's Chief 
Sanitary Inspectorate in case of an epidemic.
As the virus spreads, the UN health chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to take decisive action.
Of the 88,900 cases worldwide, 90 per cent were reported from China, most in Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, 
Tedros said.
Outside China, 8,700 cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and four countries 
account for 81 per cent of this figure, he said, naming South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan. "This is not a one-way 
street. We can push this virus back," Tedros said.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called for profiling of Muslim men at airports because "that is where the 
threat is coming from," in an interview with the Times newspaper.
The budget airline boss told the British newspaper that checks for families should be less stringent, while calling for 
the focus to shift to Muslim men travelling on their own.
"Who are the bombers? They are going to be single males travelling on their own," the Irishman said in comments 
published on Saturday.
"If you are travelling with a family of kids, on you go; the chances you are going to blow them all up is fucking zero.
"You can't say stuff, because it's racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion. Thirty years ago it 
was the Irish," the 58-year-old said. "If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat."
Labour parliamentarian Khalid Mahmood said the Ryanair boss was "encouraging racism."
"In Germany this week a white person killed eight people. Should we profile white people to see if they're being 
fascists?" the Times cited Mahmood as saying. "He's being very blinkered and is actually encouraging racism."
O'Leary is famous for his controversial statements. He once called for a fat-tax on overweight passengers and 
famously considered a "pay-per-pee" plan on board Ryanair flights, though the Irish airline never carried out the 
plans.

O'Leary suggesting racial profiling to be introduced at airports."

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said that Boeing aircraft will be the "safest, most checked planes" once the 
manufacturer overcomes its issues with its 737 MAX models following two deadly crashes.
Speaking to the British newspaper the Times, the Irish businessman criticized the United States manufacturer for 
doing a "seriously bad job of explaining their new planes," but also cast a vote of confidence in the company's new 
aircraft.
"People will love the plane when it's back, but we have a customer confidence issue," the budget airline boss told 
the Times in the interview published on Saturday.
"We will deal with that by hopefully having lower fares onboard the plane while trying it out.
"And if someone decides they don't want to fly for a period of time we will say, 'Fine, you can offload yourself and 
we will refund you.' That's how much confidence we have in the plane," the famously refund-averse O'Leary said.
The Irish budget airline did not cancel a contract with Boeing to order up to 210 of its 737s, including MAX models, 
despite the US company's grounding of the 737 MAX series last March after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia 
killed 346 people.
The primary cause of the crashes in October 2018 and March 2019 is thought to be a fault in the flight control 
software, which Boeing had wanted to fix with an update more than a year ago.
In the most recent setback for Boeing, whose grounded 737 MAX airliners created a backlog in orders, foreign 
object debris was found in fuel tanks of some of the aircraft during maintenance work, the aviation giant said on 
Tuesday.

Vienna Airport's net profit rose by 14.4 per cent year-on-year in the first three quarters, as budget airlines are 
seeking to expand market share in this major hub for Central and Eastern European destinations.
Net profit reached 152 million euros (167 million dollars), while revenues rose by 7.8 per cent to 643 million euros in 
the period between January and September, the airport reported on Thursday.
Lufthansa subsidiaries Austrian Airlines and Eurowings, as well as budget carriers Lauda, Wizz Air and Level have 
increased their passenger volumes and the number of flights in Vienna.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary announced in September that his company's subsidiary Lauda plans to 
overtake Austrian Airlines as Vienna's dominant carrier in five years, as part of his battle plan against Lufthansa.
While the airport is profiting from the competition, Austrian Airlines has been suffering and announced last week 
that it would cut its workforce by up to 800 until 2021.
Austrian Airlines chief executive Alexis von Hoensbroech said that the number of available budget carrier seats in 
Vienna would rise from 4.5 million this year to 7 million next year.

Berlin/Vienna (dpa) - German airline Lufthansa plans to step up its cost-cutting programme, as a result sending the 
group's shares surging amid better-than-forecast net quarterly profit.
With the cost-cutting drive already under way at its European budget airline Eurowings, Lufthansa announced on 
Thursday that it was launching a new drive to boost profit at its Brussels Airlines, Austrian Airlines and Lufthansa 
Cargo offshoots.
Austrian Airlines said it was slashing its workforce by about 10 per cent in the face of stiff competition from low-cost 
carriers, including Ireland-based Ryanair group and the Hungarian Wizz Air, which are also using Vienna as a hub.
The step is part of a new plan to slash annual costs at Austrian by 90 million euros (100 million dollars) a year, the 
airline's management said. Between 700 and 800 jobs are set to be cut by the end of 2021.
"We have to reposition ourselves to be able to survive the brutal competition against budget carriers," chief 
executive Alexis von Hoensbroech told a press conference in Vienna.
Cologne-based Lufthansa said group third-quarter net profit climbed 4 per cent to 1.154 billion euros compared with 
the same period last year after sales rose 2 per cent to about 10.177 billion euros.
Analysts had expected net profit to drop to 890 million euros in the three months to end of the September.

Budget airline Ryanair is not interested in buying Thomas Cook subsidiary Condor but would consider acquiring 
parts of the German holiday carrier if it is split up to guarantee competition, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary 
said Thursday.
The head of Europe's largest budget carrier charged that the German government's recent 380-million-euro (420-
million-dollar) bridge loan for Condor was in preparation for Lufthansa buying another German airline and gaining 
market dominance.
"This is yet another fattening up of a German turkey," O'Leary told a press conference in Vienna, the base of 
Ryanair's Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion.
British tour operator Thomas Cook collapsed and filed for liquidation on Monday, leaving tens of thousands of 
holidaymakers stranded. Unlike its parent company, Condor is solvent and continues to operate, but has obtained a 
bridging loan to guard against potential liquidity shortages.
O'Leary said European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager should not only look at US giants like 
Amazon and Google, but at Germany's Lufthansa. He pointed to the German carrier's past acquisition of troubled 
Air Berlin.
If Lufthansa ended up swallowing Condor, "we would expect there to be competition divestments" that might be of 
interest to Ryanair, the head of Ireland-based airline said.
Lufthansa made a non-binding offer for Condor in May but has not confirmed this week whether it is still interested. 
However, Lufthansa has never officially withdrawn its bid.

British-based pilots for Irish budget airline Ryanair have called off a planned five-day strike, the British Airline Pilots 
Association said Friday.
"This comes despite the fact that the relationship between Ryanair and its pilots in the UK and elsewhere remains 
acrimonious. Instead of engaging in negotiations Ryanair has reverted to type, electing to punish pilots by 
withdrawing their travel benefits," the association said in a statement.
UK pilot representatives had agreed to suspend any further strikes in order to pave the way for "meaningful 
negotiations under the auspices of the UK conciliation service, ACAS."
"Despite a strong turnout for strike action and a high level of commitment among pilots in Ryanair, the pilot 
representatives took the decision to allow a breathing space in the hope that constructive negotiations could get 
underway," the statement added.
The pilots association said it retained the ability to set new strike dates should it be necessary.
Strikes were due to be held on September 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29.
British-based Ryanair pilots launched strike action last month due to disagreements over pay structure, pensions, 
license insurance and other benefits.
Last year, strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
this year's summer holiday season in August and September.

Ryanair boss expects Boeing 737 MAX delays to further disrupt growth

The head of Ryanair said he fears that the budget airline's growth plans will be further disrupted by delays in 
deliveries of aircraft from US manufacturer Boeing, which is still grappling with its 737 MAX planes being banned 
from the air.
Boeing 's 737 MAX series was grounded in March after two crashes involving the MAX 8 variants, one in March in 
Ethiopia that killed 157 people and another in Indonesia in October that killed 189.
The cause of the crashes appears to be linked to a software malfunction.
The delivery of planes ordered by Ryanair could be delayed into 2020, said Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary at the 
annual general meeting of the flight company on Thursday in Dublin.
Ryanair might not receive the first aircraft in the delivery until March or April, O'Leary said, adding that Ryanair has 
stopped its payments to Boeing and is in negotiations with the US manufacturer to receive compensation.
Ryanair will have to curb its growth plans even further if there are extended delays, O'Leary said.
The Irish airline has a contract with Boeing to order up to 210 of its Boeing 737s, including MAX models.
O'Leary already announced plans to tone down the company's growth strategy in response to the Boeing MAX 
crisis and Britain's imminent exit from the European Union. The company is also dealing with potential strike action 
from pilots in Britain and Spain.
He also talked about job cuts mentioned earlier this year. Around 500 to 700 roles are expected to be slashed.

Budget airline Ryanair was able to operate a normal schedule in Britain on Thursday morning in spite of a strike by 
pilots, local media reported.
There had been fears of delays after Ryanair lost a court bid on Wednesday to stop its British pilots from taking part 
in strike action.
However, the airline on Thursday reported a 97 per cent punctuality rate for its first departures and arrivals at British 
airports, according to a statement carried by the PA news agency.
"We do not expect any disruptions to our flights to or from ourUK airports today," Ryanair said.
A judge in London on Wednesday rejected Ryanair's application for an injunction against the British Airline Pilots' 
Association (Balpa), which was planning labour action on Thursday and Friday as well as on a series of dates in 
September.
The High Court in Dublin earlier ruled in favour of a similar request by Ryanair to block a strike by its pilots in 
Ireland.
The airline is also facing problems with its staff in Portugal, where the union for cabin crew members has called a 
five-day strike this week, though no considerable disruptions were expected there.
Last year, strikes by Ryanair staff across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
the summer holiday season in August and September.

The High Court in Dublin ruled on Wednesday in favour of the airline's request to prevent a strike by pilots based in

British pilots are also seeking to take part in labour action on Thursday and Friday as well as on a series of dates in 
September, but face a similar injunction request by Ryanair.
A judge in London is set to hear an application by Ryanair to block the strike by its Britain-based pilots later 
Wednesday, British news agency PA reported.
Strikes could cause flight cancellations or delays in Europe, the airline said.
For Portugal, Ryanair does not expect any considerable disruptions because the airline has already arranged a 
minimal flight plan, which is required by the government, Lusa reported.

A judge in London rejected Ryanair's application for an injunction against the British Airline Pilots' Association

The High Court in Dublin ruled in favour of Irish budget airline Ryanair's request to prevent a strike by pilots based 
in the country on Thursday and Friday.
The presiding judge was quoted by British news agency PA as saying he was preventing pilots' union Forsa "from 
directly or indirectly, organizing, directing or endorsing their members to participate in a strike on August 22 or 23."

Lufthansa head calls for slower, sustainable growth in aviation

The head of German airline Lufthansa, Carsten Spohr, said the aviation industry needs to slow down its growth and 
stop pushing forward with fare wars, and instead invest in more efficient and better quality air travel.
Speaking in Frankfurt late Monday, Spohr criticized the "unique fare war" that was waged on the Austrian and 
German market for short distance flights this summer, without explicitly naming competitor Ryanair, which is known 
for its extremely low fares.
"Five-euro (5.5-dollar) tickets don't only clog up the system, they also make us more vulnerable to criticism - and 
the many sustainable things we do as an industry are put into question," he said.
Spohr said Lufthansa stood by its responsibility as regards climate change and that it was constantly investing in 
newer, more efficient aircraft.
The airline chief also said long-distance flights would continue to be powered by fossil fuels in the future, but that jet 
fuel could be created synthetically if a climate-neutral primary energy source was available.
Spohr said the aviation tax paid by airlines and airports should be used to conduct research that would benefit the 
industry.

Irish-based pilots for Irish budget airline Ryanair warned on Friday of plans to strike, a union said.
The Irish union Forsa is required to give at least one week's strike notice and said it would notify management early 
next week unless the airline agrees to union pay proposals by Monday.
"At this stage, only a substantive counter-proposal, which properly addresses all areas of our claim, will be enough 
to prevent us serving notice of industrial action next week," Forsa assistant general secretary Ian McDonnell said in 
a statement.
A ballot on the strike saw 94 per cent of the union's members vote in favour. It was open for the about 180 directly-
employed Ryanair pilots based in Ireland who are members of the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association (IALPA). Ryanair 
pilots employed by agencies were not balloted.
The pilots are requesting wage hikes and better work conditions.
Ryanair countered that the labour action was supported by less than 25 per cent of Ryanair's Irish pilots, adding 
that "this disruption of customers' holiday plans has no valid mandate from Ryanair's Irish Pilots."
Earlier this week, British-based Ryanair pilots said they would strike for five days, August 22 and 23 as well as 
September 2-4, according to the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA).
Last year, strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
the summer holiday season in August and September.

British-based pilots for Irish budget airline Ryanair plan to strike for a total of five days at the end of August and 
early September, a union said Wednesday.
The strike will take place on August 22 and 23 as well as September 2-4, the British Airline Pilots Association 
(BALPA) said in a statement.
Last year, strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
this year's summer holiday season in August and September.
"We have had no formal offer from Ryanair and it is imperative that we resolve this dispute urgently to avoid strike 
action," BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton said.
"No pilot wants to spoil the public's travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice."
A ballot on the strikes saw 80 per cent of the union's members vote in favour, with a member turnout of 72 per cent.
The strike was called due to disagreements over pay structure, pensions, license insurance and other benefits.

Ryanair must pay back 8.5 million euros (9.4 million dollars) of illegal aid received from the French state, the 
European Commission said on Friday.
Ryanair and its subsidiary AMS received funds to promote on its website Montpellier and its environs as a tourist 
destination from the publicly-funded French tourism association APFTE, the commission found.
Between 2010 and 2017, these payments "gave Ryanair an unfair and selective advantage over its competitors" 
and also harmed other airports, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The investigation into Ryanair's marketing activities for Montpellier Airport, which saw a footfall of close to 1.9 
million in 2019, was launched last year after a complaint from a competitor. As of April, the Irish airline no longer 
flies from Montpellier.
Last November, French authorities briefly impounded a Ryanair plane at Bordeaux airport to force the airline to pay 
another fine.
In 2014, the commission ordered Ryanair to repay approximately 868,000 euros in the case of the Angouleme 
airport near to Bordeaux, 2.4 million euros in the case of the Pau airport, and 6.4 million euros in the case of the 
Nimes airport.

An airline may cite "extraordinary circumstances" in denying passengers compensation if a fuel leak on the runway 
causes a long delay, the top EU court said on Wednesday.
Passenger rights have become increasingly contested in Europe's crowded skies, and countries such as Germany 
have seen a sharp increase in complaints.
At issue is a case filed against Ryanair, which denied a passenger compensation of 250 euros (285 dollars) after a 
a flight from Italy to Belgium was delayed for four hours due to a fuel leak on the runway.
Under EU regulations, passengers may claim compensation after a delay of three hours, barring special 
circumstances.
In this case, it was aircraft fuel from another plane that had leaked on to the runway, causing a delay that "could not 
have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken within the meaning of that provision," the 
European Court of Justice (ECJ) wrote in a non-binding summary.
Such a case should be considered an extraordinary circumstance, the Luxembourg judges wrote.
The court took a similar line in April in a ruling concerning the budget airline Germanwings.
The judges concluded that passengers may be denied compensation for flight delays caused by a screw on the 
runway, if the carrier proves that it did everything possible to try to stick to the timetable - another example of a 
special circumstance.

Lufthansa's shares dropped Monday more than 12 per cent from Friday's price after the Frankfurt-based airline 
issued a profit warning.
Operating profit is now forecast to come in at between 2.0 and 2.4 billion euros (2.2 - 2.7 billion dollars), down from 
the previous estimate of between 2.4 and 3 billion euros.
Management is seeking to build up reserves of 340 million euros to cover increased tax payments over recent years 
following a new ruling by the Federal Finance Court.
According to a weekend statement by the company, the long-haul business continues to be profitable. But 
Lufthansa's budget subsidiary, Eurowings, is thought likely to make a loss in the current year.
Eurowings, which absorbed large parts of Air Berlin following its bankruptcy, is to take additional cost-cutting 
measures, which will be announced shortly.
The subsidiary is feeling the heat from competitors Ryanair and Easyjet. Lufthansa also pointed to a rise in fuel 
costs.
Lufthansa's airfreight unit, Lufthansa Cargo, is also not performing as expected. It has grounded three older 
machines and is predicting stagnant turnover for the year.

Budget airline Ryanair signed a deal with the Maltese government on Tuesday to buy Malta Air, a Maltese start-up, 
expanding its presence on the Mediterranean island.
Malta Air will operate out of Malta using a fleet of six aircraft, increasing to 10 over the next three years. 
The deal will see Ryanair aircraft from France, Italy and Germany move to the Maltese aircraft register.
The investment will allow Ryanair to grow its already sizeable presence in Malta, and access non-EU markets like 
North Africa from Malta, according to a statement.
The deal was signed in Valletta between Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and Maltese government officials, in the 
presence of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. 
Muscat said Malta Air will complement the services of Air Malta, the country's flagship carrier.
"Despite the scaremongering, Air Malta has not just survived but registered its first surplus in two decades. 
Welcome Malta Air and long live Air Malta," Muscat told reporters.
Last month, Ryanair announced that its annual net profit had slumped by almost one third as overcapacity in the 
European short-haul sector caused it to cut ticket prices.

Austria's political leaders and sports figures mourned Niki Lauda as a national icon and commemorated his strong 
personality after the three-time Formula One world champion died on Monday, aged 70.
"One of the greatest and colourful characters has left us - an idol and ambitious fighter who never gave up," 
Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen said in a statement.
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also remembered Lauda as an airline entrepreneur.
"The race tracks were his home and aviation was his love," Kurz said, stating that "the entire country and the world 
of motorsports mourn one of the greatest Austrians."
"He is an example of courage, discipline and straightforwardness," the chancellor said of the Formula One legend 
who had achieved sports and business comebacks from an almost lethal racing accident and from the crash of a 
large passenger aircraft.
"Niki Lauda was an inspiration and visionary for the entire airline industry," Laudamotion airline said in a tribute.
Lauda, who was known as a tough businessman, originally founded the airline, sold it, bought it back, and sold it 
again to Irish budget carrier Ryanair last year.
"He was incredibly egoistic," said Helmut Marko, the Austrian advisor of the Red Bull Formula One team.
However, Lauda's personality had softened after he met his second wife Birgit, and after she gave birth to his two 
youngest children, Marko told broadcaster Oe24.
"He became more considerate, which had not been his strength," Marko said about his friend Lauda, who served as 
non-executive chairman of the Mercedes Formula One team.
Austria commemorates national sport and business icon Lauda
Lauda was friends with various Austrian top athletes, including Annemarie Moser-Proell, who ranks among the most 
successful athletes in Alpine skiing history.
"His fighting spirit after his accident, and the way he fought back - what he achieved is incredible," she said.
The former racer also fondly remembered how Lauda had picked her up with his private jet after one of her overall 
World Cup victories.
Retired Austrian tennis great Thomas Muster said he liked Lauda's "direct manner, and his way of tackling issues 
head-on."
"That's what made him special," Muster said.

Austrian Formula One legend Niki Lauda has died at age 70, his doctor Walter Klepetko told dpa early Tuesday.
Lauda died peacefully in his sleep on Monday surrounded by family, a family spokeswoman said in a statement.
"His unique achievements as an athlete and entrepreneur are and will remain unforgettable," the statement added.
The three-time world champion received a lung transplant last year, and was hospitalized with the flu in January. He 
had in previous years received two kidney transplants.
Lauda's head was badly burned in a fiery crash at the German Grand Prix in 1976 and his lungs were damaged by 
toxic smoke.
Following his first Formula One world title in 1975, Lauda won two more times in 1977 and 1984.
By the end of his racing career in 1985, he had competed in 171 Formula One races, won 25 of them and stood on 
the podium 54 times.
Before retiring, the racer launched Lauda Air in 1979 which he sold in the 1990s.
In 2003, he founded another airline, Niki, which he sold to Air Berlin in 2011. He bought it back in January 2018 to 
run it under the Laudamotion brand, only to sell it quickly to Irish budget carrier Ryanair.
In later years, Lauda became an adviser for the Ferrari race team, before becoming non-executive chairman of the 
Mercedes F1 team in 2012.

The Austrian world champion was known for his red cap, shrewd business sense and will to survive.
Formula One legend Niki Lauda was not a quitter.
After a horrific car crash that disfigured him for life he went on to win races, and he weathered the crash of a 
passenger jet during his time as an airline entrepreneur.
On Monday, the Austrian triple world champion died at the age of 70 less than a year after receiving an emergency 
lung transplant.
The surgery was performed almost exactly 42 years after Lauda crashed into a fence at the German Nuerburgring 
track at a speed of 200 kilometres an hour during a race.
"The impact was so hard that the helmet was ripped off my head," he said of the crash.
His Ferrari went up in flames, and it took 55 seconds to pull him out of the car.
At the hospital, a priest gave him the last rites, in light of his serious burns and damaged lung.
"But I did not want to die. I wanted to go on living," Lauda said four decades after the crash.
Lauda did not only go on living, he went on fighting.
Just 42 days after the crash, Lauda was again behind the wheel and took fourth place in the Italian Grand Prix in 
Monza, ending the championship season as runner-up to British rival James Hunt.
Niki Lauda, legendary Formula One survivor, dies at 70
"Coming back quickly was part of my strategy of not sitting at home and thinking about why this had happened to 
me," he said.
Apart from lingering health problems, the crash also left Lauda with his signature red sports cap.
His physiotherapist initially gave it to him to keep his head bandages in place, but he kept wearing it so that people 
would look him in the eye rather than at his scarred scalp.
Following his first Formula One world title in 1975, Lauda won two more times in 1977 and 1984.
By the time the Austrian ended his racing career in 1985, he had competed in 171 Formula One races, winning 25 
of them and standing on the podium 54 times.
Before retiring from the track, the racer launched Lauda Air in 1979.
In May 1991, one of his aircraft crashed after takeoff from Bangkok. All 223 passengers and crew members died.
"I was deeply shocked," Lauda said of the accident, admitting that he felt guilty until an investigation showed a 
technical problem caused the tragedy.
Lauda, known as a tough businessman, sold the airline in the 1990s.
In 2003, he founded another airline, Niki, which he sold to Air Berlin in 2011. He bought it back in January 2018 to 
run it under the Laudamotion brand, only to sell it quickly to Irish budget carrier Ryanair.
The son of an industrialist family proved his shrewdness when he started his racing career.
He lied to his grandmother to get money for his first racing car, saying he needed it to buy real estate, according to 
a book he co-authored on his business outlook.
He also faked his high school diploma in order to get parental approval to begin car racing.
In later years, Lauda became an adviser for the Ferrari race team, before becoming non-executive chairman of the 
Mercedes F1 team in 2012.
Since then, Mercedes have dominated the hybrid era with three drivers' world titles with Lewis Hamilton and one 
from the now retired Nico Rosberg alongside four constructors' championships.
Lauda was also known to motorsport fans as a television commentator over 20 years.
"Red cap, clear and direct words," Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff said in summarizing the man.

Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair has paid damages to individual passengers whose flights did not reach their 
destinations on time due to strikes, a Hamburg court said Monday.
In at least five legal proceedings, Ryanair recognized the demands of the plaintiff, a Hamburg court spokesman 
said.
Ryanair declined to comment on the proceedings.
Ryanair has previously refused to compensate passengers whose flights were cancelled due to strikes by Ryanair 
staff.
Under EU legislation for flight cancellations, an airline should pay 250 euros (293 dollars) to each passenger, 
unless they are informed at least two weeks in advance or are offered alternative flights arriving at their destination 
the same day.
An airline can withhold compensation if it can show that the cancellation is "caused by extraordinary circumstances 
which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken," according to the rules.
Last year, Ryanair argued that no compensation is payable "when the union is acting unreasonably and totally 
beyond the airline's control."
Air travel legal service provider Flightright, which has submitted lawsuits on behalf of hundreds of clients, disagrees, 
saying the company has provoked strikes with years of low wages and could have avoided an escalation of the 
labour action.
Flightright legal expert Oskar de Felice said the airline's behaviour was tactical: Ryanair wants to prevent the 
Hamburg court from pushing the issue on to the European Court of Justice.

The foundation stone for a major extension to Frankfurt Airport in the form of a third terminal was laid on Monday in 
the face of protest from local residents fearing an increase in noise and emissions.
As the official ceremony was held with 700 invited guests, opponents of the terminal held a vigil at the airport's 
Terminal 1.
The first phase, to be completed in 2021, will take some of the load off the current two terminals, which handled 70 
million passengers last year. By 2023, the new terminal is intended to handle 21 million passengers.
When complete, up to 25 million passengers a year will pass through it.
Fraport, the company that operates Germany's main hub, is planning to invest some 4 billion euros (4.5 billion 
dollars) in the project - one of the largest private infrastructure undertakings in Europe.
While the company has not identified potential clients, speculation was that the new gates available from 2021 
would be well suited to the needs of budget carriers, such as Dublin-based Ryanair.
Speaking for the protestors opposed to the new terminal, Thomas Scheffler said the foundation stone was a 
gravestone for the region. The protestors are calling for a halt to the project and an extension of the overnight 
period during which no flights are allowed.
They are also demanding a cut in the number of flight movements to 380,000 a year. Last year the airport saw more 
than 512,000 flight movements and is aiming at capacity for more than 700,000.

An EU court on Friday dismissed a legal action by German airline Lufthansa that contested subsidies to Frankfurt-
Hahn Airport and contracts it entered into with Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair.
Lufthansa, which does not use the airport, had failed to show that its business had been negatively affected enough 
to justify its complaint, the European Union's General Court ruled.
At issue are subsidies worth millions of euros paid out in previous years. Lufthansa - Europe's largest airline if all its 
subsidiaries are included - alleged unfair competition.
It challenged a 2014 decision by the European Commission to approve the subsidies, on the basis that they were 
not in breach of EU competition rules.
Hahn lies some 120 kilometres from Frankfurt, where Lufthansa has its main hub.
The 2014 decision allowed payments to Hahn airport by Fraport, which operated both Hahn and Frankfurt Airport at 
the time, as well as two German states.
Of the three, only one of the German states - Hesse - still holds a minority share in Hahn. In 2017, China's HNA 
took over 82.5 per cent of the airport.
The commission decided in 2014 that the support for Hahn airport was either not state subsidies or was compliant 
with EU subsidy rules.
Lufthansa said it would consider whether to challenge the decision before the European Court of Justice, the bloc's 
top tribunal.

Agreement has been reached with Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair on a pay deal for 1,100 cabin crew 
stationed in Germany, services union Verdi announced in Berlin on Wednesday.
Cabin crew are to receive an additional 600 euros (680 dollars) a month in basic pay, additional supplements of up 
to 250 euros and social arrangements on being transferred, the union said.
There was no immediate comment from Ryanair, which has traditionally been hostile to unionization among its staff.
German labour law was being implemented on behalf of the Germany-based staff for the first time, Verdi executive 
member Christine Behle said. She noted there was as yet no agreement on setting up a works council of the kind 
usual in larger German companies.
In December, Ryanair and Germany's Cockpit pilots' union (VC) agreed on the major points of a settlement in their 
pay dispute, averting strike action ahead of the Christmas holiday season.
The more than 400 Ryanair pilots stationed in Germany had previously gone on strike, stopping work three times 
over the course of 2018.

Ryanair has breached Italian labour laws by evading social security and bonus payments for its airport staff, 
according to Italy's labour inspection agency.
"Serious violations" were documented during the course of 2014 at more than a dozen Italian airports served by the 
low-cost Irish airline, the agency said in a statement.
Ryanair was accused of having made "illicit recourse" to about 600 third-party workers to save on insurance, 
pension and bonus payments it would have had to pay to in-house staff.
The illegal conduct took place at airports in Bari, Bergamo, Pisa, Rome, Brindisi, Cagliari, Catania, Lamezia Terme, 
Milan Malpensa, Palermo, Pescara, Alghero and Trapani, according to the agency.
The airline was asked to pay 9.2 million euros (10.4 million dollars) in unpaid labour charges and fines, and 
investigators said they are now probing Ryanair's labour practices in the years following 2014.

Europe's biggest budget airline is taking precautions in case of a no-deal Brexit by shifting some of its spare parts 
from a British central storage unit to other EU locations.
Ryanair's director of maintenance and engineering told dpa that Britain's unregulated departure from the European 
Union could make moving parts around difficult because of customs restrictions, for example.
"We're concerned that it could take longer to get spare parts to airports where we need them quickly from the 
central storage in Stansted," Karsten Muehlenfeld said, referring to a London airport.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is an outspoken critic of Brexit, though he says his Irish airline, which is registered in 
the EU and not in Britain, will not be as badly affected as some British-based airlines.

The European Union needs to better protect aviation workers from exploitation, the European Commission said 
Friday.
The bloc's executive released a report outlining proposals to strengthen labour conditions for pilots and cabin crew, 
including tighter regulation of non-contractual labour and undeclared work, which typically do not grant benefits or 
protections.
Among the proposals was convening a group of labour and aviation experts that will advise the commission and 
member states on how to better implement labour laws.
The report comes at a time of rising labour unrest in the industry, most notably seen in a series of strikes by Ryanair 
pilots and cabin crew since mid-2018.
"Increased competition, automation and digitalization [have] also had an impact on the workforce, notably through 
the development of atypical forms of employment," the commission said in a press release.
"This has led to legal uncertainty and the risk of disrupting the level playing field among airlines," it added.
Two million workers in the EU are directly employed in the aviation industry, while it supports 9.4 million jobs in total 
and contributes 110 billion euros (125.4 billion dollars) to the bloc's economy, the commission release noted.
Meanwhile, the number of daily flights has jumped from under 10,000 in 1992 to around 25,000 in 2017.
The German pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit welcomed the commission announcement as a "long-awaited 
wake-up call."

Low cost airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air were fined by Italy's antitrust regulator on Thursday for their hand-luggage 
restrictions.
The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) said extra charges for larger carry-on bags, which the two airlines 
introduced last year, represented an unfair trade practice.
Being able to take on board a reasonably sized bag as part of the standard air fare is an "essential service" that 
should not be subject to additional fees, AGCM said.
It fined Ryanair 3 million euros (3.4 million dollars) and Wizz Air 1 million euros. Both companies were given 60 
days to change their luggage policy.

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Monday reported a third quarter net loss of 20 million euros (23 million dollars), blaming 
a decline in average fare prices.
The airline said it carried 32.7 million passengers in the three months ending on December 31, an 8-per-cent 
increase on the same period last year, while revenue increased by 9 per cent to 1.53 billion euros.
However the increases were offset by rises in fuel, staff and compensation costs.
"While a 20-million-euro loss in Q3 was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than 
expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and future traffic 
growth," Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said.

Irish budget carrier Ryanair has taken complete control over Laudamotion, the Austrian airline announced Tuesday.
Ryanair bought the remaining 25 per cent of the shares from the Niki Lauda Holding at the end of December, in 
addition to the 75 per cent it had previously held.
Despite the takeover, former Formula One champion Niki Lauda will retain a seat on Laudamotion's company 
board, chief executive Andreas Gruber told a press conference at Vienna International Airport.
Lauda, who also serves as non-executive chairman of the Mercedes Formula One team, originally founded the 
airline under the name Niki in 2003 and sold it to the Air Berlin group in 2011.
Following Air Berlin's bankruptcy, he bought it back last year and re-established it as Laudamotion, only to sell it 
quickly to Ryanair.
Laudamotion made a loss of about 140 million euros (160 million dollars) last year.
Gruber said he expects the loss to narrow to 50 million euros in 2019, and to start making profits next year.
Laudamotion, which mainly connects European airports, also announced plans Tuesday to double its fleet to 40 
aircraft until the 2021/2022 financial year.
Annual passenger numbers are to rise to 10 million by then, from 4 million last year.

Extreme doomsday scenarios for a no-deal Brexit - often based on loosely-defined scenarios - forecast grounded 
passenger planes, enormous queues at customs points and businesses crippled by bureaucratic chaos.
Pro-Brexit lawmakers from Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party, many of whom prefer no deal to her 
deal, insist that there is little to worry about.
The truth probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes.
If British lawmakers do not accept May's withdrawal deal and fail to ratify it before March 29, Britain would be on 
track for an unregulated Brexit.
Britain could seek an extension of the two-year Brexit negotiating process triggered by May in March 2017.
Otherwise, EU rules would cease to apply in Britain, which would drop out of shared arrangements such as 
common air-traffic rules or trade deals with third countries.
The land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland poses a particular problem. Efforts to keep 
that border open have been at the heart of Brexit negotiations.
British citizens living in the EU and EU citizens in Britain could also face uncertainty over their status.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned on Friday that the economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit 
"would be profound, widespread and lasting."
"Businesses would face new costs and tariffs," CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said in a speech. "Our ports 
would be disrupted, separating firms from the parts they need to supply their customers."
Eurosceptics say such predictions are part of a "project fear" to persuade people to accept May's deal.
No-deal Brexit: Total chaos or free-trade bonanza?
They say the two sides would be able to implement a series of rapid, sectoral mini-deals to minimize disruption 
before they negotiate an alternative, perhaps Canada-style deal after Brexit.
In their favour, two of the largest budget airlines operating in Britain - Ryanair and easyJet - have both said in recent 
weeks that they anticipate relatively little disruption from a no-deal Brexit.
Jean-Marc Puissesseau, head of the French ports of Boulogne-Calais, told the BBC last week that he had been 
preparing for a no-deal Brexit for a year and "will be ready" in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We will not check the trucks more than we are doing today with the migrants," Puissesseau said, referring to 
checks for illegal migrants trying to reach Britain from France.
In parliament on Wednesday, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a senior member of May's cabinet, said there 
had been "some exaggerated claims about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, and the British economy is resilient."
In answer to a question on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on agriculture, however, Gove agreed that 
"farmers in some of [Britain's] most vulnerable sectors ... would be significantly adversely affected in the short term."
The Brexiteers argue that any short-term damage would be more than offset by the long-term, liberal trade deals 
Britain plans to sign with major non-EU economies such as the United States, China and India.
May announced plans last month to make planning for a no-deal Brexit an "operational priority" for the government.
She told parliament that a no-deal Brexit would bring risks to "the jobs, services and security of the people we serve 
by turning our backs on an agreement [with the EU]."
May highlighted preparations for potential post-Brexit problems "such as the flow of traffic into different ports here in 
the UK."
But she stopped short of earlier forecasts of doom issued by her government and the central bank.
Under her withdrawal agreement, Britain's economy would be 3.9 per cent smaller in 15 years' time than it would be 
if the country remained in the EU, according to a government forecast in late November.
A no-deal Brexit would see GDP fall even further, by 9.3 per cent over the same period, it said.
The Bank of England forecast the same day that the pound would depreciate by 25 per cent against the US dollar in 
a "disorderly" scenario.
In that case, inflation could skyrocket to 6.5 per cent, and unemployment to 7.5 per cent, while GDP could fall by 
nearly 8 per cent, the bank said.
Angry Brexiteers dismissed the two reports, while even pro-EU economist Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of 
England adviser, tweeted that both forecasts appeared to "support political objectives."

Ryanair achieved a customer score of 40 per cent, behind other short-haul companies Thomas Cook Airlines (52 
per cent) and Wizz Air (54 per cent), which mainly fly to destinations in Eastern and Central Europe.
Passengers cited frustration with cancelled flights, ever-changing luggage rules and the airline's declining 
punctuality record as factors in their negative assessment.
Thousands of respondents told Which "that they would never again fly Ryanair, even if it was cheaper than its 
rivals."

London (dpa) - London's Gatwick Airport - Britain's second-busiest - reopened Friday after a 36-hour shutdown 
caused by drone sightings.
The disruption since Wednesday affected tens of thousands of passengers and caused hundreds of flights to be 
cancelled.
Military equipment has also been deployed as part of attempts to prevent further disruption.
Transport Minister Chris Grayling told the BBC that the protective measures included "military capabilities," but did 
not offer details.
He said there had been around 40 drone sightings while the airport was closed.
Military experts have joined police units, including snipers and a helicopter. Police officers were also sighted on the 
roof of a building at the airport on Friday.
Authorities were also searching for the drone operators after the multiple drone sightings began late on 
Wednesday.
Flying a drone within 1 kilometre of an airport or airfield boundary was made illegal in Britain in July, but aviation 
officials and lawmakers have called for a 5-kilometre exclusion zone.
Although flights have resumed, the airport cautioned on its Twitter account that there were "knock-on delays and 
cancellations to flights."
The airport said 765 flights were scheduled for departure and arrival on Friday, while about 140 have been 
cancelled.
Gatwick reopens after drone sightings, but delays expected
"We are now operating at almost normal runway conditions and the challenge for the airlines, as the result of this 
disruption, [is that] their planes are not all in the right place," Gatwick's chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said, 
according to the BBC.
Passengers were advised to check the status of their flight before heading off for the airport.
Low-cost airline Ryanair for instance said its planes would use London's third largest airport, Stansted. Passengers 
have been informed, Ryanair said.
EasyJet, another no-frills carrier, meanwhile advised passengers to check its designated flight checker app rather 
than tweet for flight information "due to the unprecedented volume of tweets we're receiving at the moment."

London's Gatwick Airport is working on "contingency plans" for Friday, after the drone sightings that have caused 
hundreds of flights to be cancelled continued for a second night late Thursday.
Britain's second-busiest airport would remain closed for the rest of Thursday, chief operating officer Chris 
Woodroofe said, adding that it was considering cancelling all flights the following day.
"I think what's clear from the last 24 hours is that drones are a UKaviation issue, or even an international aviation 
issue," Woodroofe told reporters.
"We have had the police, we have had the military seeking to bring this drone down for the last 24 hours and to 
date that has not been successful."
"So Gatwick Airport is still closed, it's closed for the rest of this evening and our intention is to review on an ongoing 
basis whether we can open tomorrow.
"But we are working up contingency plans all the way through to no flights tomorrow."
He said he felt "terribly sorry" for the 120,000 passengers whose flights had been disrupted by "this criminal 
activity."
Ryanair said it was rerouting its Friday flights from Gatwick out of Stansted Airport.
Military experts joined police units, including snipers and a helicopter on Thursday in the search for the operators of 
drones but with no success.
Gatwick works on 'contingency plans' as drone sightings continue
Prime Minister Theresa May earlier told reporters that the government would work with airport authorities to "bring 
this to a close such that people will be able to get on to the travel that they were expecting over the Christmas."
"The activity we have seen is illegal and those who are caught endangering aircraft can face up to five years in 
prison," she added.
Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson declined to say how the military would help, while his ministry tweeted only 
that it would provide "specialist equipment" to help the police.
Flights were suspended after reports of multiple sightings of drones flying over the airport in the southern English 
county of Sussex from 9 pm on Wednesday.
Sussex Police said officers believed "the Gatwick devices used are of an industrial specification."
British media published photographs of a police helicopter flying over the runway and armed officers carrying rifles 
near the airport.
The police said there was no indication of terrorism.
Superintendent Justin Burtenshaw, head of armed policing for Sussex, told the BBC it was "challenging" to find the 
drone operators.
"Each time we believe we get close to the operator, the drone disappears; when we look to reopen the airfield, the 
drone reappears," Burtenshaw said.
Flying a drone within 1 kilometre of an airport or airfield boundary was made illegal in Britain in July, but aviation 
officials and lawmakers have called for a 5-kilometre exclusion zone.
The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) said the first 11 months of 2018 saw 117 "near misses," compared to 
93 for the whole of 2017.
"The public needs to understand that drones are not just toys and could have catastrophic consequences if they 
collide with an aircraft," BALPA's head of flight safety, Rob Hunter, said in a statement on the Gatwick disruption.

No-deal Brexit: 'Managed glidepath' or total chaos?
In their favour, two of the largest budget airlines operating in Britain - Ryanair and easyJet - have both said in recent 
weeks that they anticipate relatively little disruption from a no-deal Brexit.
Penny Mordaunt, a prominent pro-Brexit minister in May's cabinet, coined an addition to the growing Brexit lexicon 
late Monday: "managed glidepath."
"The chief concern businesses have in my constituency about no deal would be the absence of a smooth and 
managed glidepath to future trading relationships," The Sun newspaper quoted Mordaunt as saying in a speech at 
a private members' club in London.
"It's in our interest, and the interest of every member state of the EU, that we have a smooth transition and that is 
what we should be focusing on in the immediate future," Mordaunt said.
The Brexiteers argue that any short-term damage would be more than offset by the long-term trade deals Britain 
plans to sign with major non-EU economies such as the United States, China and India.
"Leaving without a deal is not the end of the world," Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads a group of dozens of 
eurosceptic Conservative lawmakers, tweeted on Tuesday, as May's cabinet announced plans to make planning for 
a no-deal Brexit an "operational priority" for the government.
Defence Secretary Gacin Williamson said 3,500 troops will be placed on standby in case they are needed by the 
government.
May admitted to parliament on Monday that a no-deal Brexit would bring risks to "the jobs, services and security of 
the people we serve by turning our backs on an agreement [with the EU]."
She said the government had already stepped up preparations for potential post-Brexit problems "such as the flow 
of traffic into different ports here in the UK."
But May stopped short of the forecasts of doom issued last month by her government and the central bank.
Under her withdrawal agreement, Britain's economy would be 3.9 per cent smaller in 15 years' time than it would be 
if the country remained in the EU, according to a government forecast.
A no-deal Brexit would see GDP fall even further, by 9.3 per cent from GDP over the same period, it said.
The Bank of England warned the same day of economic chaos from a no-deal Brexit, forecasting that the pound 
would depreciate by 25 per cent to the US dollar in a "disorderly" scenario.
In that case, inflation could skyrocket to 6.5 per cent, and unemployment to 7.5 per cent, while GDP could fall by 
nearly 8 per cent, the bank said.
Angry Brexiteers dismissed the two reports, while even pro-EU economist Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of 
England adviser, tweeted that the reputation of economic forecasts had "taken a bad blow."
Both forecasts appeared to "support political objectives," Sentance said. "Let's debate Brexit - which I strongly 
oppose - rationally without recourse to bogus forecasts."

Britain's aviation regulator on Wednesday announced legal action against budget airline Ryanair over its refusal to 
pay compensation to passengers affected by strikes this summer.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it had launched enforcement action after the airline refused to 
compensate passengers whose flights were cancelled due to strikes by Ryanair staff.
Ryanair deemed the strikes "unreasonable" and claimed this meant the tens of thousands of passengers affected 
by hundreds of flight cancellations across Europe were not entitled to compensation under EU regulations.
The CAA said it rejected the airline's claim that the industrial action, organized by trade unions, constituted 
"extraordinary circumstances" that could be exempt from the compensation provisions.
Under EU legislation for flight cancellations, an airline should pay 250 euros (293 dollars) to each passenger, 
unless they are informed at least two weeks in advance or are offered alternative flights arriving at their destination 
the same day.
An airline can withhold compensation if it can show that the cancellation is "caused by extraordinary circumstances 
which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken," according to the rules.
Ryanair argued in late July that no compensation was payable "when the union is acting unreasonably and totally 
beyond the airline's control."

Ryanair and Germany's Cockpit pilots' union (VC) have agreed the major points of a settlement in their pay dispute, 
averting strike action ahead of the Christmas holiday season, both sides announced in Frankfurt on Tuesday.
The pay deal, which will run to March 2023, is set to be in place by the end of February next year.
"I'm very optimistic on this," VC's Ingolf Schumacher told dpa.
The more than 400 Ryanair pilots stationed in Germany went on strike for the first time a little under a year ago and 
stopped work three times over the course of 2018.
Under the tentative agreement, starting co-pilots are to receive fixed pay of 50,000 euros (57,000 dollars), an 
effective doubling in pay, while captains will see a smaller percentage rise to 100,000 euros.
Europe's largest budget carrier is to employ its German-based pilots under German law from the end of February, 
Schumacher said.
The Dublin-based carrier flies its Boeing 737s to more than 215 airports in 37 countries, operating from 86 bases in 
Europe and North Africa.
Last month, it struck a deal with the German union Verdi on cabin crew pay.

Budget airline Ryanair paid French authorities 525,000 euros (596,000 dollars) Friday to release a plane seized at 
Bordeaux Airport the day before, the country's aviation authorities said.
The Irish carrier's climbdown came too late for the 149 passengers who had been forced to disembark from their 
Thursday afternoon flight to London when the jet was impounded on the tarmac.
France's civil aviation directorate earlier said it was "regrettable" the plane had to be impounded "as a last resort" in 
order to recoup state aid to Ryanair that the European Union had ruled was illegal.
The passengers experienced a five-hour delay but made it to their destination with a later Ryanair flight, the 
directorate said.
In 2014, the European Commission said Ryanair had to repay 858,000 euros' (973,000 dollars') worth of rebates 
and marketing arrangements it received at Angouleme airport, not far from Bordeaux.
The EU at the time also ordered authorities to recoup money from Ryanair and Transavia over benefits they had 
received at two other French regional airports.
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment. The plane was released back to the airline at about 12:30 pm 
(1130 GMT) after the payment was received, authorities said.

France has impounded a plane operated by budget carrier Ryanair at Bordeaux Airport in order to recoup state aid 
paid to the Irish airline, aviation authorities said on Friday.
The plane's 149 passengers, heading to London, were already on board and had to disembark when the aircraft

The passengers experienced a five-hour delay but made it to their destination with a later Ryanair flight, France's

It was "regrettable" that the plane had to be impounded "as a last resort" after several efforts to get Ryanair to repay

Ryanair has come to an agreement with the union Verdi in a dispute over wages paid to German cabin crew, the 
budget airline said on Thursday.
The deal, which according to Ryanair includes pay increases and other benefits, is yet to be approved in a cabin 
crew ballot. Ryanair expects the vote to take place in the coming week.
Verdi confirmed the deal with Ryanair without giving further details.
The company said it was "pleased" to sign the agreement, which follows similar deals in Italy, Greece and Sweden.
The Irish air carrier said these were "concrete signs of the substantial progress Ryanair is making in concluding 
agreements with our people and their unions in many different EU countries."
Verdi had been pushing for Ryanair to comply fully with German labour law - a move Ryanair says has now been 
confirmed.
Ryanair cabin staff in several European countries went on strike in September. Ryanair workers in Germany also 
took part, with Verdi saying the company's pay offer was unsatisfactory.
As a result of industrial action in August, Ryanair struck off some 400 flights in European countries, including 150 in 
Germany.

Low-cost airline Ryanair has sacked six cabin staff over a photograph of them appearing to sleep on the floor of an 
airport crew room, insisting that the picture was staged to back a "false claim."
The six cabin staff, who were based in Porto in Portugal, were dismissed from their jobs on Monday "for breach of 
contract on grounds of gross misconduct," Ryanair said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
The airline said the group had staged "a fake photograph to support a false claim - widely reported in international 
media outlets - that they were 'forced to sleep on the floor' of the Malaga crew room."
It said their action had "damaged their employer's reputation and caused an irreparable breach of trust" with 
Ryanair.
After the photograph circulated on social media last month, Ryanair posted footage from a security camera in the 
room, which showed uniformed staff sitting on chairs in the room before some of them went to lie on the floor to 
pose for the picture.
Portuguese trade union SNPVAC, which represents the staff, said earlier that the photograph was "a gesture of 
protest" against the conditions they endured after they were stranded in Spain by a storm.
The Ryanair staff were not given hotel rooms and were left "without the minimum legal requirements for suitable 
accommodation," with inadequate access to food and drink, and enough seating for only one-third of them, the 
union said.
It said Ryanair's claim that the viral photograph was staged was itself "fake news."

Irish budget airline Ryanair and its chief executive Michael O'Leary are being sued for allegedly providing 
misleading information to investors on the company's relations with some workers.
A pension fund in Alabama accuses Ryanair of deceiving investors about conflicts with pilots and other employees, 
which caused clear losses in the company's stock market value, according to a complaint lodged at a New York 
court.
Ryanair rejected the accusations levelled against it on Wednesday, saying that the "claims are doomed to fail as 
they have no basis in fact or reality."
The pension fund is seeking compensation for damages due to the decline in share prices. It wants to pursue the 
case as a class action lawsuit, hoping that other investors will follow suit.
It remains to be seen whether the court will approve or throw out the legal complaint.

Low-cost airline Ryanair cannot relocate 16 of its pilots based in the Netherlands to other countries, a Dutch court 
has ruled.
The court in the southern city of Den Bosch stopped the planned forced relocations on Thursday.
Ryanair said it will appeal the decision. The Irish airline had notified the pilots of the relocations on October 1 
because its site in the city of Eindhoven was being closed.
The pilots fought the decision in court, saying the forced relocations were a reaction to recent strikes.
The court agreed with their position on Thursday.
"It appears as though the decision was made as a penalty for earlier strikes," the court said in a statement.
Ryanair has had a difficult year plagued by strike action across Europe. Last month, it reported a 7-per-cent fall in 
profits in the first half of its financial year, blaming "widespread damage" from the strikes, among other things.
Dutch pilots joined the biggest strike in Ryanair's history in August, which led to cancellations across Europe.
Ryanair has announced the closing of its site at Eindhoven, but the court said the company hadn't sufficiently 
proven that the closure was necessary for business reasons.
According to the law in Ireland, where Ryanair is headquartered, such forced relocations would be allowed.

Passengers with low-cost airline Ryanair will no longer be able to take a 10-kilogram piece of hand luggage on 
board for free under a new policy introduced on Thursday.
Under the new rules, passengers who want to bring anything bigger than a "small personal bag" will be charged 
extra unless they are a priority boarding customer.
Priority boarding costs 6 euros (7 dollars). Customers who do not choose priority boarding will have to pay 10 euros 
for an extra piece of cabin baggage.
The new policy has provoked outrage on social media, with some customers claiming they will never fly with 
Ryanair again.
Italy's antitrust watchdog on Wednesday said in a statement that it was banning the new policy from taking effect in 
the country.
Bringing hand luggage on board a flight was an "essential component" of a flight, Antitrust Italia said in a statement, 
claiming that extra charges for hand luggage were misleading to customers.
The authority demanded the suspension all activities that involved charging customers extra to carry a large piece 
of hand luggage.
Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said the airline would appeal the decision, and claimed the regulation is 
transparent and benefits customers.

Baggage handlers and the firm Aviapartner have reached a deal to end a strike that had disrupted operations at 
Brussels Airport, allowing normal operations to resume, the airport announced Wednesday.
"Aviapartner will gradually resume activities as of this afternoon, which will allow for a return to normal operations 
for the flights handled by Aviapartner," the airport said on its web site.
The airport added it "deplores the major impact this unannounced strike has had on passengers and airlines," 
noting that 960 flights were cancelled and almost 115,000 travellers were affected over the six-day strike.
The work stoppage came at a busy travel time in Belgium, when many schools have a term break.
Aviapartner workers had cited grievances over low wages, understaffing and a bonus that was promised but not 
fully paid, according to the news agency Belga.
Under the deal, Aviapartner will cut workloads, invest in more equipment amounting to 3.2 million euros (3.6 million 
dollars), approve new bonuses and monitor the implementation of these proposals, Belga reported, citing union 
officials.
The agreement would also see more workers hired and have more workers employed under contracts.
Aviapartner, which handles Brussels baggage for Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways and TUI Fly, is contracted in 37 
airports in six European countries, according to its website.

according to the news agency Belga.
The strike by employees of the services company Aviapartner started on Thursday evening. After a pause, 
Aviapartner's management and the unions resumed talks Monday morning. But the two sides remain far apart.
The strike comes at a busy travel time. Many schools across Belgium have a term break this week to coincide with

About 350,000 people were expected to travel via Brussels Airport during this period, according to Belga.
Among the list of strikers' grievances are low wages, understaffing and a bonus that was promised but not fully

The European Commission has started an investigation into whether the company operating a German regional 
airport violated EU rules on state aid in its treatment of Ryanair.
At issue is Germany's Frankfurt-Hahn airport, located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. From 2009 to 2017, the 
state controlled the firm managing the airport, Flughafengesellschaft Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH (FFHG). The HNA 
Group purchased 82.5 per cent of FFHG in 2017.
Brussels opened an investigation after receiving a complaint that the airport was giving favourable treatment to the 
budget carrier Ryanair, the commission said Friday in a statement.
The probe will look at agreements between Ryanair and the state prior to 2009, and between Ryanair and FFHG 
after 2009, to see if the carrier received preferential treatment.
The post-2009 agreements under review include deals covering airport service agreements, training aid to Ryanair 
and other projects.
The commission will also investigate whether certain land sale agreements between the state and FFHG ran afoul 
of EU competition rules.
Under these rules, states may provide assistance to regional airports if it helps local development, connectivity and 
traffic decongestion. This aid may include subsidies to budget airlines.
Publically owned airports, however, cannot extend incentives that exceed what a profit-driven airport operator would 
offer under the same conditions.
German airport operator under EU scrutiny for state aid breach
The commission has already concluded numerous other probes into airports and state aid, including cases in 
France, Germany, Austria, and Italy - all of which found instances of EU state aid violations.

Irish budget airline Ryanair rejected on Thursday claims that it illegally employs hundreds of contract workers in 
Germany.
Some 700 of Ryanair's 1000 flight attendants in Germany signed their employment contracts with two companies 
based in Ireland, in contradiction with German law, German parliamentarian Pascal Meiser said on Wednesday.
The accusations are not true, Ryanair communications director Robin Kiely said, adding that the company and its 
service providers comply fully with EU law.
The two companies in question, Crewlink Ireland and Workforce International Contractors, are based in Dublin.
Meiser, who belongs to the hard-left Die Linke party, says the companies lack the necessary authorization for 
contract labour.
Ryanair has in recent times confronted labour law issues in a number of European countries. Trade unions are 
calling for the application of national labour law, rather than just Irish employment rules.

Low-cost airline Ryanair reported a 7-per-cent fall in profits in the first half of its financial year, blaming "widespread 
damage" from strikes and disruptions to air-traffic control across Europe, as well as lower fares and higher fuel and 
pilot costs.
The carrier said its net profit dropped to 1.2 billion euros (1.4 billion dollars) in the six months ended September 30, 
as average fares fell 3 per cent amid excess capacity in Europe and many air-traffic control (ATC) problems, "which 
caused a spike in cancellations of higher fare, weekend flights."
Ryanair was also hit by strikes by its own pilots and cabin crew but said these caused minor financial impact.
"Repeated ATC strikes and staff shortages mean that 2018 will be the worst year on record for European ATC 
disruptions," Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
"These have caused widespread damage to airline punctuality and schedules," O'Leary said.
He said Ryanair had "made good progress" in negotiations with trade unions since it agreed to recognize them in 
December, citing agreements with pilots or cabin crew in Ireland, Italy, Britain, Germany and Portugal.
"We continue to engage with unions in our other major markets," O'Leary said, claiming "competitor employees 
have interfered to delay agreements" in some countries.
Ryanair staff staged eight days of strikes this summer, but the airline "worked well to minimize disruptions," he said.
The Dublin-based airline is contingency planning for the "rising" risk of Britain leaving the European Union in March 
with no withdrawal deal in place, O'Leary said.

Ryanair to create base at Berlin's Tegel

Body
Dublin-based Ryanair is to make Berlin's Tegel airport its 10th base in Germany from April next year, taking over 
four planes already stationed there by its partner airline Laudamotion, the budget carrier announced on 
Wednesday.
Making the announcement in Berlin, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sketched out plans to expand the 
airline's routes, but said he expected no growth in Germany, partly because of continuing conflict with German 
unions over pay and conditions.
For as long as there was no clarity with the unions, there would be no further investment in additional planes, he 
said.
Ryanair owns three quarters of Laudamotion, which has taken over take-off and landing slots at Tegel from the 
bankrupt Air Berlin subsidiary Niki.
Ryanair recently announced the closure of its base in Bremen in north-western Germany, where two planes are 
based. It also said it would withdraw two of the five planes it has at Weeze on the Dutch border, in what German 
trade union officials saw as a "declaration of war."
O'Leary denied this, insisting that fuel prices were to blame. "Oil is at 85 dollars, you idiots," said the chief 
executive, who has a reputation for combative language. Further rises in the price could lead to further closures, he 
added.
Nevertheless, O'Leary said talks with the Verdi trade union and the pilot's Cockpit association were going well, with 
meetings set for this week and next and agreement possible by Christmas.
Ryanair to create base at Berlin's Tegel
In charge at Ryanair since 1993, O'Leary has expanded the former loss-maker to being Europe's largest budget 
airline. He indicated his intention to step down within three years.

German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer is to gather politicians and aviation business figures in a bid to take on 
some of the industry's woes on Friday.
Covering German and international air travel, participants at the conference in the northern port city of Hamburg are 
looking for solutions to the growing number of delays and cancellations.
Among the reasons for the travel chaos are ageing infrastructure, the bankruptcy of airlines such as Air Berlin and 
most recently Primera Air, and strikes in a number of European countries. An increase in storms is also causing 
problems for the industry.
In a draft proposal seen by dpa ahead of Friday's meeting, the government set out plans to shift short-haul flights to 
the country's railways. The government also wants to improve transport connections to important international 
airports.
Following a wave of industrial action against budget airline Ryanair, the German union Verdi called on the 
government to take decisive action ahead of Friday's meeting.
"On several levels Ryanair does not abide by the rules of the game in Germany," Verdi board member Christine 
Behle said.
A joint declaration of intentions is expected at the the end of the two-hour meeting, set to kick off at 10 am (0800 
GMT).

German labour union Verdi on Saturday hailed Ryanair flight attendants and pilots in Germany for their participation 
in a 24-hour Europe-wide strike, despite increasing pressure from their employer.
The airline staff's contribution to the strike was "all the more courageous because the employees participated 
despite great pressure," a Verdi spokeswoman told dpa on Saturday in Berlin.
Airline representatives had threatened to close locations ahead of the labour action, but the cabin crew and pilots 
were not deterred. The 24-hour strike ended overnight on Friday."We hope that Ryanair has understood the signal 
and finally puts a decent offer on the table," the Verdi spokeswoman said. The airline's staff is calling for increased 
wages and better working conditions in accordance with different countries' respective national laws.
The second Europe-wide strike by Ryanair pilots and flight attendants involved not only Germany, but also 
employees from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands.
At least 250 flights were cancelled on Friday due to the strike, constituting about 10 per cent of the Ryanair's 
scheduled European routes, the Irish airline said in Dublin.The Verdi spokeswoman also emphasized the support of 
local politicians, including Labour Minister Hubertus Heil, who met striking employees in Berlin.
"This support encourages employees," she said, while adding that even some travellers have shown interest and 
understanding at affected airports.

Irish budget airline Ryanair faced new strike action coordinated by unions in six European countries on Friday, with 
at least 250 flights cancelled across the continent.
Ryanair pilots and cabin crew from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany are participating 
in the walk-out, the second Europe-wide action to hit the company.
The airline and the unions provided starkly different figures for how many flights would be affected.
Ryanair apologized on Twitter to customers "affected by this unnecessary disruption," saying 90 per cent of flights 
were operating normally.
"Despite the regrettable and unjustified strike action taking place in six of our 37 markets today, all 400 of our first-
wave aircraft departed on schedule this morning," the airline said.
The Dublin-based budget carrier had earlier this week announced the cancellation of 150 out of 2,400 European 
flights for the day.
On Friday, it said more than 2,150 Ryanair flights would operate as normal, or about 90 per cent of its usual 
schedule, "carrying 400,000 customers across Europe."
"Ryanair took every step to minimize the disruption and we notified our customers as early as possible advising 
them of their free move, refund or reroute options," the airline said.
Some 133 flights to and from Germany were cancelled, according to a tally by the flights portal Airliners.de. This 
would represent about 40 per cent of Ryanair's total flights to and from the country.
Ryanair hampered by Europe-wide strike action
On Thursday, Ryanair gave the expected number of cancellations in Germany first as 35 to 45, and then as "less 
than 100," following a decision by Germany's Cockpit pilots' union (VC) to participate in the strike.
An official from the German Verdi union gave considerably higher numbers, saying that some 250 flights would be 
struck off.
"This has been serious intimidation from the company, which has made it even more heartening that colleagues are 
taking part," said Verdi's Mira Neumaier.
A similar strike action in August led to some 400 flights being cancelled, including 150 in Germany.
Employees are striking for more pay and better conditions, in line with national law in various countries.
The company, long known for its opposition to the unionization of its workforce, has faced repeated strike action 
since the beginning of the year by pilots and cabin crew.

Ryanair employees from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany are participating in the walk-

some 250 flights would be struck off.

German cabin crew are being urged to join a day-long strike targeting Ryanair flights, trade union Verdi said on 
Thursday.
It called on some 1,000 Ryanair staff to join pilots on a countrywide strike on Friday in support of higher pay and 
better working conditions at the Dublin-based budget carrier.
"Europe's largest low-cost airline refuses to grant its employees a decent income and a corporate culture free of 
fear as before," Verdi executive Christine Behle said in Berlin.
Several unions across the European Union have called for a strike to halt Ryanair flights. Almost 200 flights have 
been cancelled as a result.
The company, long known for its opposition to the unionization of its workforce, has faced repeated strike action 
since the beginning of the year by pilots and cabin crew.
Employees are striking for more pay and better conditions, in line with national law in various countries.

The cancelled flights make up some 10 per cent of the Germany schedule. The Dublin-based budget carrier earlier 
announced the cancellation of 150 out of 2,400 European flights for the day.
Ryanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew noted that several workers' rallies were planned.
German cabin crew urged to join Ryanair strike amid cancellations
Ryanair employees from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany are participating in the 
strike, the second pan-European action to hit the company.
Ryanair has laid a complaint with EU competition authorities alleging that its competitors are behind the coordinated 
action.
The company expressed disappointment that Germany's VC was joining the strike, noting progress made in talks 
with VC on Tuesday, including the appointment of a German mediator.
Bellew said Ryanair was keen to strike a deal within six weeks, with a view to concluding conditions and pay 
contracts by the end of the year.
On Tuesday, the airline said it had signed a new contract with its cabin crew in Italy that will begin on October 1 and 
run for three years.
In Belgium meanwhile, the CNE trade union accused Ryanair of acting "irresponsibly" by failing to cancel enough 
flights on Friday.
Ryanair's behaviour "could create tensions and insecurity for all staff at the airport, at Ryanair and for the 
passengers concerned," the union said in a statement.
Conditions could be particularly bad at Charleroi, Belgium's main airport for low-cost carriers, where 20,000 airline 
passengers could be expected on Friday, CNE said, warning of potential "chaos."
The European Consumer Organization, BEUC, warned that the strikes could leave many passengers without 
compensation.
"We call on Ryanair to compensate consumers caught up in the latest wave of mass cancellations according to EU 
passenger rights rules," said Monique Goyens of BEUC, arguing that many passengers had no "realistic option to 
defend their rights."

A man in his 20s was arrested on Thursday after running onto a runway in an effort to catch his flight from Dublin 
Airport.
The late passenger, Patrick Kehoe, ran across a runway in a bid to stop the Ryanair flight to Amsterdam early 
Thursday morning, Irish national broadcaster RTE and other media reported.
He had forced his way through the boarding gate and broken a door lock to access the runway, the reports said.
Kehoe ran towards the plane "with his suitcase under his arm," RTE quoted a witness as saying.
The BBC quoted an airport spokesman as saying Kehoe and a woman accompanying him had arrived late at the 
boarding gate, after the flight had closed.
"They were engaging with Ryanair staff at the gate and the male passenger was becoming agitated," the 
spokesman said.
"He was banging on the window to try and get the aircraft to wait... and made his way onto the apron, trying to flag 
the aircraft down."
The man's brash behaviour continued after an appearance in Dublin District Court later Thursday to answer a 
charge of criminal damage, when he lowered his trousers to reveal his buttocks to press photographers, according 
to RTE. He was bailed to appear again on November 8.

The European Commission warned Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on Wednesday that the airline must 
comply with EU rules, as cabin crew members gear up for a mass strike on Friday to demand better work 
conditions.
EU Employment Commissioner Marianne Thyssen and O'Leary had a "frank and open discussion" about 
employment conditions at Ryanair and the current social tensions, commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said. 
Wednesday's meeting had taken place at O'Leary's request.
Thyssen called upon O'Leary to "ensure full compliance with all applicable EU rules and legislation, as it is the case 
for all EU airline companies," Schinas added.
"Respecting EU law is not something over which workers should have to negotiate, nor is it something which can be 
done differently from country to country. I made this very clear to Mr O'Leary today," Thyssen said in a statement.
"I am not against Ryanair or against the low-cost business model. But with great success also comes great 
responsibility," she added.
Staff across Europe have long been at loggerheads with Ryanair due to its practice of employing them under Irish 
labour law. Trade unions in Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands argue that they would receive better 
conditions under their domestic laws.
Ryanair cancelled 150 European flights scheduled for this Friday due to the planned strike, which is the latest in a 
series of industrial actions.
It had originally expected 190 cancellations but issued an updated figure on Wednesday.
EU warns Ryanair to comply with EU rules as mass strike looms
The airline argues that the strike is "unnecessary" since it has improved its offer in recent weeks to pilots and cabin 
crews in Ireland, Britain, Italy and Germany.

Ryanair has cancelled 190 European flights on Friday due to planned strikes by cabin crew in Spain, Belgium, The 
Netherlands, Portugal, Italy and Germany, the budget airline said on Tuesday.
In a statement, Ryanair described the strike action as "unnecessary," adding: "Ryanair has made significant 
progress in recent weeks with our union negotiations, which include pilot and/or cabin crew agreements in Ireland, 
UK, Italy and Germany."
Strikes by Ryanair pilots and cabin crew across Europe had already resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of 
flights this summer.
Ryanair's marketing chief Kenny Jacobs said: "We hope these unions will see common sense and work with us to 
finalize agreements for the benefit of our pilots and cabin crew over the coming weeks without further disrupting our 
customers or our flights."
Also on Tuesday, the airline said it had signed a new contract with its cabin crew in Italy.
The contract will begin on October 1 and run for three years, Ryanair said. It includes an increase in wages under a 
new compensation structure.
Ryanair agreed the terms of the contract in mid-September with the FIT CISL, ANPAC and ANPAV unions.
However, other Italian trade unions that did not participate in the negotiations criticized the contract and called for 
an emergency meeting on Tuesday with Labour Minister Luigi Di Maio.
Members of the Italian unions that rejected the deal were planning to take part in the strike action on September 28.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary retained his position with overwhelming backing at the budget airline's 
annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday, despite having presided over recent pilot and crew strikes that have 
caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
O'Leary was backed by 98.5 per cent of shareholders at the meeting near Dublin, Ryanair confirmed on Thursday. 
"The board wants me to extend my contract," O'Leary reportedly said at the AGM. Chairman David Bonderman also 
retains his position, with 70.5-per-cent backing.
Ryanair's marketing chief Kenny Jacobs said on Tuesday that he believed O'Leary would stay in post for another 
five years, but the German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit had called on Ryanair shareholders to vote in a new 
leadership.
Strikes by Ryanair pilots and crew across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the 
height of this year's summer holiday season, with the airline's share price plummeting as a result.
Cabin-crew unions from Spain, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands have announced a strike over pay and 
conditions for September 28. Pilots in Italy are also set to strike, though a deal was struck last week with Italian 
cabin-crew unions after Ryanair approved better pay and conditions.

Low-cost airline Ryanair, which is facing an increasingly restless workforce across Europe, said on Friday it has 
agreed the terms of a comprehensive labour deal with Italian cabin crew unions.
The FIT CISL, ANPAC and ANPAV unions signed "a set of agreed principles [...] which will form the basis of a 
comprehensive Collective Labour Agreement," Ryanair said in a statement.
The airline said it agreed to grant Italian labour and pension rights - rather than less generous Irish ones - and 
"higher pay under a new pay structure" linked to a more favourable tax regime.
"This agreement follows recent cabin crew agreements in Ireland with FORSA [union] and in the UK with UNITE 
[union]," Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said.
In a separate statement, the Italian unions said they also negotiated the right to be paid via Italian bank accounts 
and secured less stressful shift regimes.
The collective agreement should run for three years, until the end of 2021, the parties said, and it is due to be 
signed in the coming days.
The deal was announced a day after flight attendant unions from Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and the 
Netherlands announced a strike over pay and conditions for September 28.
In August, Ryanair signed another collective labour agreement with Italian pilots. Their union ANPAC said it was the 
first of its kind in Europe, and hailed it as "historic."
However, other Italian pilot unions, Filt Cgil and Uiltrasporti, said Thursday that their members rejected that deal in 
a referendum, and would also strike on September 28.

Budget airline Ryanair has confirmed that flight attendants in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands 
will strike over pay and conditions on September 28.
"Ryanair management chose to continue to ignore the law and [to continue] with the bullying culture that is part of 
the company for decades," said a statement signed by trade unions from the five countries.
The statement reiterates their demands to work under local contracts, bound by local standards. Many Ryanair staff 
across Europe have Irish employment contracts, which the trade unions argue give them worse conditions than 
under local law.
"We will not back down until these demands are met," the statement says, calling on Ryanair's investors and 
shareholders to take a stand at the company's annual general meeting on September 20.
The announcement came shortly after the airline resumed operations on Thursday following a 24-hour strike that 
caused the carrier to cancel 150 of its 400 flights to and from Germany the previous day.
In a statement announcing the new strike, Ryanair dismissed claims that the Wednesday strike had caused "travel 
chaos," saying that 70 per cent of its Germany-based pilots and cabin crew had reported for work despite the 
stoppage.
"Repeated false claims made by unions about 'travel chaos' have proven to be unfounded," said Ryanair's 
marketing chief Kenny Jacobs, adding that despite the "partial" September 28 strike, the airline would "carry the 
overwhelming majority of the 400,000 passengers who will be scheduled to fly with us that day."
German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) and German workers union Verdi organized the strike in an effort to 
push for better pay and conditions for their members.
Crew in five European countries to join new Ryanair strike
Ryanair's hubs at Frankfurt (Hahn) and Berlin-Schoenefeld were most affected by the cancellations.
The airline dismissed the industrial action as unjustified, citing offers it has already put on the table. German 
Ryanair employees had also walked out for a day in August.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary Wedneday said Ryanair would not "roll over" because of a one-day 
strike which he termed "somewhat unsuccessful."
O'Leary accused the unions of making a "ludicrous demand" earlier this year for a 42-per-cent pay increase.

Ryanair pilots and flight attendants joined a 24-hour strike Wednesday that prompted the budget airline to cancel 
150 of its 400 flights to and from Germany.
The strike was organized by German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) and German workers' union Verdi in an 
effort to push for better pay and conditions for their members.
Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, said Ryanair would not "roll over" because of a one-day strike that 
was "somewhat unsucessful."
"The majority of our flights in Germany will still operate, so your strike has been somewhat unsucessful," O'Leary 
said in comments addressed to the German unions.
"We don't doubt the vigour of the German unions," he told reporters in London. "There is nothing that we haven't 
agreed to do, and yet they still want to go off and have their strike."
"We will not roll over," O'Leary added, accusing the unions of making a "ludicrous demand" earlier this year for a 
42-per-cent pay increase.
He insisted that recent strike action across Europe by Ryanair pilots and cabin staff had caused "minimal 
disruption" to the airline's operations.
"If you threaten us with a strike and we think your reason for that is unreasonable, then we will take strikes and we 
will manage our way around those strikes, as we've done successfully in Ireland, when we had five days of strikes 
by just 25 per cent of pilots," he said.
150 Ryanair flights cancelled as German pilots, cabin crew strike
"It resulted in 20 flight cancellations a day for five days, out of a total of 300 flights that we operate daily to and from 
Ireland," he said.
"We don't want strikes but we are willing to accept strikes, put up with them, if it means defending our cost basis 
and our ability to offer low-fare air travel to our customers."
The walkout by Ryanair staff in German had already caused delays early Wednesday.

The risk of Britain leaving the European Union in March without a transition agreement is being underestimated and 
could lead to flights being grounded for days or even weeks, Ryanair's chief executive said on Wednesday.
Pro-Brexit critics have said such claims are designed to create fear and persuade more people to oppose 
Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit proposals, but Ryanair's Michael O'Leary insisted that the risks 
were growing.
"We remain concerned at the increasing risk of a hard - no-deal - Brexit in March 2019," O'Leary said.
"While we hope that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 will be agreed, recent events in the UK 
have added uncertainty, and we believe that the risk of a hard Brexit - which could lead to flights being grounded for 
a period of days or weeks - is being underestimated."
May is scheduled to chair a special meeting of her cabinet to discuss the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Thursday.

The first joint strike of Ryanair pilots and flight attendants will make it "very difficult" for the budget airline to get 
flights off the ground in Germany on Wednesday, a spokesman for the German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit

The airline's Germany-based planes represents about one-tenth of its global fleet. Ryanair has not yet announced

Budget airline Ryanair has cancelled 150 of its 400 flights to and from Germany on Wednesday due to a joint strike 
by pilots and flight attendants, marketing chief Kenny Jacobs said.
The strike has been organized by pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) and Verdi and is likely to include the 
majority of Ryanair's 400 pilots and around 1,000 flight attendants, according to a VC spokesman.
Ryanair said the industrial action is unjustified, citing improvements in pay and working conditions that have already 
been offered.
"Since we have already offered local contracts and better pay, there is no justification for further 
disruptions," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said Tuesday.
Verdi warned that Wednesday's stoppage could be the first of several strikes, with board member Christine Behle 
saying: "This is a first warning strike. Anything further will depend on the process of the negotiations."

German Ryanair pilots plan to go on strike again this week, just one month after a wave of strikes caused hundreds 
of flights across Europe to be cancelled.
Pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit has called for a new 24-hour strike to begin this Wednesday, the union said in a 
statement Monday.
As with the last round of strikes, the pilots and crew are seeking new contracts that include better pay and working 
conditions.
Strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights this summer.
Italy, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are among the other countries where 
Ryanair pilots and cabin staff have taken strike action.
More recently, unions have been striking deals with the budget airline. An Irish pilots union voted to accept an 
agreement with Ryanair last week, while the Italian pilots union ANPAC has voted to approve a collective labour 
agreement two weeks ago.

An Irish pilots union voted to accept an agreement with budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday, potentially ending a 
long-running labour dispute that resulted in several strikes this summer.
The Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) said its members voted unanimously to accept the deal, which follows 
mediated negotiations between the two sides last month.
The pilots had objected to Ryanair's plans to change seniority rules and were unhappy with its procedures for 
annual leave, transfers and promotions.
The union said the deal could be "the first step towards providing transparency and fairness for Ryanair pilots while 
also assisting Ryanair in recruiting and retaining pilots in the future."
IALPA spokesman Joe May said: "While our members fully respect Ryanair's operational model, they no longer 
accept the company's highly problematic employment model."
The union accused Ryanair of attempted "union busting" in July after the airline warned that it could cut 100 pilots 
and 200 cabin crew from its staff in Ireland as it reduces its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.
In a statement on Wednesday, Ryanair welcomed the union's vote and said it would ask the company's board to 
"reconsider their decision to re-base six aircraft away from Dublin this winter."

The Italian pilots union ANPAC has voted to approve a collective labour agreement reached with low-cost airline 
Ryanair following a protracted a labour dispute, both sides have announced.
The more than 300 members of Italy's largest airline pilots union approved the agreement by a large majority on 
Monday evening, the union said on Tuesday.
ANPAC called the deal an "historic event," and "the first collective agreement signed by Ryanair in Europe."
Italy is one of the Irish airline's largest markets.
The agreement, reached after eight months of negotiations and signed in Italy, ensures better protection and pay 
conditions for pilots, the union said.
Ryanair said it hopes to sign a similar deal with its Irish pilots in the near future. The airline reached an agreement 
with Irish pilots' union Forsa this week, but the pilots still have to vote to approve the deal.
Strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights during the past two 
months.
Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are among the other countries that have 
mounted strike actions.
Ryanair only started recognizing pilots unions last year, taking the step during negotiations to ward off a previous 
threat of strikes.

The company said on Tuesday that it has invited unions in Britain, Germany and Spain to negotiate in the coming

Low-cost airline Ryanair has reached an agreement with its Irish pilots in a labour dispute, both sides have 
announced.
"Following a 22-hour negotiating session, which began on Wednesday morning and concluded Thursday morning, 
agreement has been reached between Forsa and Ryanair in the pilots' dispute," the pilots' trade union Forsa said 
on Thursday.
Ryanair confirmed the agreement to dpa, without giving details.
The pilots now have to vote to approve the deal, with the union recommending that they accept it.
"The mediator ... has asked both sides to refrain from further comment until the ballot has concluded and we will 
respect his wishes," Ryanair said.
In the dispute over holiday time, transfers and promotions, 100 of Ryanair's 350 Irish-based pilots took part in five 
days of strike action.
The Irish airline is in dispute with trade unions in several EU countries, which came to a head in mid-August with the 
biggest pilots' strike in Ryanair's history that affected 55,000 passengers across Europe.
German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) told dpa that it wants to wait and analyse the outcome of the 
agreement between Ryanair and its Irish pilots before continuing to negotiate with Ryanair.
"It poses the question whether mediation could come into consideration in Germany too," said VC Vice President 
Markus Wahl.
Ryanair and Irish pilots reach agreement in labour dispute
A further round of negotiations between the discount carrier and VC hasn't been started since the mid-August 
strike.
VC is asking for better pay, among other things, but Ryanair is wary of making agreements that would put its low-
cost business model at risk.
German labour union Verdi is also negotiating with Ryanair regarding better pay. Additionally it is fighting for 
measures against temporary work and short-term staff relocations.

The biggest industrial action by pilots in Ryanair's history got under way on Friday, with nearly 400 flights across 
Europe cancelled due to the 24-hour stoppage that includes pilots in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the 
Netherlands.
The cancellations constitute about a sixth of the Irish budget airline's 2,400 scheduled flights on Friday, affecting 
some 55,000 passengers at the peak of the European holiday season.
The strike began at 3:01 am (0101 GMT) and is set to end on Saturday at 2:59 am.
Customers in Germany were the hardest hit, with 250 flights cancelled and 42,000 customers affected. There was 
no travel chaos at German airports, however, as passengers were notified two days in advance.
German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said it was satisfied with the impact of the strike, adding: "We hope 
that Ryanair has understood our signal and is now willing to engage in serious negotiations."
According to the Swedish pilots' union (SPF), about 40 pilots were on strike. Ryanair cancelled 22 flights to and 
from Sweden, with most being flights to and from the regional Skvasta airport, about 100 kilometres south of 
Stockholm.
In the Netherlands, no flights were cancelled despite the decision of Dutch pilots to strike, Ryanair said on Friday, 
adding that it had hired substitutes.
A Dutch court failed to grant Ryanair's request for an injunction against the strike late Thursday.
Across the affected countries, passengers have been given the option to reschedule their flights free of charge or 
get their money back. Ryanair will not compensate passengers beyond that.
Flights axed across Europe in biggest strike in Ryanair 's history
The only people not to be affected by Ryanair cancellations in Germany are those flying to and from 
Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airport. The pilots stationed there are not participating in the strike.
Pilots and crew are seeking new contracts that include better pay and working conditions.
In a statement late Thursday, Ryanair said it had taken "every step to minimize the disruption." It called the strike 
"regrettable and unjustified" and called on unions to continue negotiations.
Ryanair has only recognized pilots' unions since last year, taking the step during negotiations to ward off a previous 
threat of strikes.
However last month cabin crews in Portugal, Spain and Belgium went on strike for two days, causing the 
cancellation of 600 flights.

About 40 Ryanair pilots in Sweden went on strike on Friday, the Swedish pilots' union (SPF) said.
"Today our members are on strike to demand their rights," SPF head Martin Lindgren said in a statement.
The union said it wanted its members to have basic labour rights, and the right to select its representatives in talks 
with Ryanair.
In the Netherlands, however, no flights were cancelled despite the decision of Dutch pilots to strike, Ryanair 
announced on Friday. The discount airline has hired non-striking foreign pilots as substitutes.
To date, the 24-hour stoppage also affects pilots in Belgium, Germany and Ireland.
As far as the strike's impact in Sweden is concerned, Ryanair cancelled 22 flights to and from Sweden.
The strike action affected most of Ryanair's flights to and from the regional Skvasta airport, about 100 kilometres 
south of Stockholm.
Skavsta airport was prepared to assist passengers affected by the strike, but so far only "a handful" have turned up 
and they "were easily accommodated," Skavsta airport managing director Peter Steinmetz told dpa.
The strike has been "well communicated," he added.
Ryanair had a late evening flight from Skavsta to London Stansted as well as one flight to Naples, Italy, that were 
not affected by Friday's labour action.
Ryanair said it had informed passengers affected by the cancellations.

Ryanair is seeking a temporary injunction in the Netherlands to block a 24-hour strike by pilots there scheduled to 
start on Friday.
A Haarlem court will rule Thursday on whether the Dutch national pilot union may join several others in carrying out 
industrial action.
One in six flights by Ryanair - Europe's largest budget airline - have been cancelled in anticipation of the strike, 
coming to about 400 in total.
Some 55,000 passengers are set to be affected, with 42,000 of those in Germany alone.
Pilots and crew want Ryanair to roll out a new contract on wages that include better working conditions, but both 
sides blame each other for a breakdown in the negotiations.
The German union announced on Wednesday that its members would join their counterparts in Belgium, Germany, 
Ireland, and Sweden in the strike. It is scheduled to take place between 3:01 am (0101 GMT) Friday and 2:59 am 
Saturday.
If the pilots' strike goes ahead as planned, it would be the biggest such action to affect the Irish company.
Ryanair has only recognized pilot unions since last year, taking the step during negotiations to ward off a previous

Dutch pilots for budget airline Ryanair are allowed to take part in Europe-wide strike action on Friday, a Dutch court 
in Haarlem ruled.

Some 22 flights will be affected by the industrial action in The Netherlands.

Ryanair is seeking a temporary injunction in the Netherlands to block a strike scheduled to start on Friday.
A Haarlem court will rule Thursday on whether the national pilot union may go ahead with the strike, which is set to 
last one day.
Pilots and crew are seeking a new contract on wages that includes better working conditions.
The union announced Wednesday that its members would join their counterparts in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and 
Sweden in the strike. It is scheduled to take place between 3:01 am (0101 GMT) Friday and 2:59 am Saturday.
The discount airline, based in Ireland, responded by filing its injunction request and wants to block strikes for the 
entire summer. Altogether, about 400 flights have been cancelled in anticipation.

Budget airline Ryanair has cancelled 250 flights scheduled for Friday in response to an announcement from the 
German pilots' union that its members would join a strike by Ryanair pilots in Sweden, Ireland and Belgium.
The move comes on top of 146 other cancellations announced several days ago due to the coinciding pilot strikes 
in three other countries, taking the total number of cancellations to nearly 400. It will be the biggest strike in the 
airline's history.
Ryanair's marketing chief Kenny Jacobs said passengers booked on the cancelled flights would be able to change 
their time of departure free of charge or get their money back.
The announcement came several hours after the Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) union said its members would join a 
strike taking place between 3:01 am (0101 GMT) Friday and 2:59 am Saturday and that all Ryanair flights to and 
from Germany could be affected by the action.
"Ryanair categorically ruled out any increase in pay over the course of the negotiations," said VC chief Martin 
Locher during a press conference. "At the same time, Ryanair did not give any signal as to where there may be 
leeway to find solutions."
Twenty-two of the nearly 400 cancelled flights are to and from Sweden. Most of Ryanair's flights at the regional 
Skvasta airport, about 100 kilometres south of Stockholm, will be affected, according to the head of the country's 
pilots' union.
"No talks are currently under way between Ryanair and the Swedish pilots' union (SPF)," union head Martin 
Lindgren told Swedish Radio on Wednesday. "Ryanair refuses to meet with the SPF representatives we have 
selected."

Two weeks ago, Ryanair crew in Portugal, Spain and Belgium walked off the job, forcing the budget airline to cancel 
some 600 flights over the course of two days. The action affected around 100,000 passengers.
Both pilots and crew are demanding better pay and conditions, which Ryanair has declined to grant thus far.

German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) is preparing to announce strike action, with a spokesman saying on 
Tuesday that a midnight deadline passed without the union receiving an improved offer for pay and conditions from 
budget carrier Ryanair.
The spokesman said a strike plan would be announced at 11 am (0900 GMT) on Wednesday. The stoppage is 
expected to include all 400 German Ryanair pilots, who could walk out at 24 hours' notice.
Last week, 96 per cent of the VC union's members voted in favour of industrial action.
The deadline comes three days after Irish Ryanair pilots held a 24-hour strike. It also comes ahead of a strike on 
Friday organized by pilots unions in Sweden, Belgium and Ireland that has prompted Ryanair to cancel 146 of its 
2,400 planned flights that day.
The airline said last week that it had issued notices of possible redundancy to 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew after 
its board approved a plan to cut its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.

German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit had not received an improved offer for pay and conditions on Monday, 
just hours before a deadline for the low-budget airline to avoid disruption of its services.
A spokesman for the union said in case no offer is made by 2200 GMT, a strike plan will be announced Wednesday 
that is expected to include all 400 German Ryanair pilots. They could walk out at 24 hours' notice.
Last week, 96 per cent of the union's members voted in favour of industrial action.
The deadline comes three days after Irish Ryanair pilots held a 24-hour strike.
Ryanair said the strike had had "no effect" on passengers since it cancelled 24 of Friday's 300 Ryanair flights to 
and from Ireland more than a week ago.
The airline also said it had issued notices of possible redundancy to 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew after its board 
approved a plan to cut its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.

Budget airline Ryanair urged an Irish pilots' union to agree to mediation of a long-running dispute, as the pilots held 
their fourth 24-hour strike on Friday.
The airline said the strike had "no effect" on passengers since it had cancelled 24 of Friday's 300 Ryanair flights to 
and from Ireland more than a week ago.
It accused the Irish public sector trade union Forsa, which represents the pilots, of refusing to "engage or explain" 
its position on two outstanding issues, saying the two sides had broadly agreed on other points.
"Given the non-engagement by Forsa ... [and] that unsuccessful strikes keep repeating, Ryanair now feels the only 
way to introduce common sense is by way of third-party mediation," said Eddie Wilson, the airline's chief personnel 
officer.
Wilson proposed Kieran Mulvey, a former government labour official, for the role of mediator.
Forsa, which has announced a fifth strike for August 10, said Ryanair's mediation offer was an "unexpected and 
positive development."
It said the union would "consult with its members in the company, and looks forward to talking to Kieran Mulvey 
about when a process could begin."
The pilots are unhappy about Ryanair's plans to change seniority rules and its procedures for annual leave, 
transfers and promotions.
The union accused Ryanair of attempted "union busting" last month after it warned that it could cut 100 pilots and 
200 cabin crew from its staff in Ireland as it reduces its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.

Ryanair refuses to compensate passengers for 'unreasonable' strikes

Budget airline Ryanair on Thursday refused to compensate passengers whose flights were cancelled due to strikes 
by Ryanair staff this week because it deems the action "unreasonable."
The airline cancelled 600 flights scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday due to a strike by cabin crew in Belgium, 
Spain and Portugal, affecting some 50,000 passengers.
Under EU legislation for flight cancellations, an airline should pay 250 euros (293 dollars) to each passenger, 
unless they are informed at least two weeks in advance or are offered alternative flights arriving at their destination 
the same day.
An airline can withhold compensation if it can show that the cancellation is "caused by extraordinary circumstances 
which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken," according to the rules.
"Ryanair fully complies with all EU ... legislation. However, as these flight cancellations were caused by 
extraordinary circumstances, no compensation is due," the airline said.
It argued that no compensation is payable "when the union is acting unreasonably and totally beyond the airline's 
control."
Ryanair faces another one-day strike next week by Irish-based pilots, as a European pilots' union on Thursday 
accused it of attempted "union busting" by warning that it could cut up to 300 staff in Ireland this winter.
On Thursday, the airline cancelled 20 of its 300 scheduled flights to and from Ireland on August 3, saying the Irish 
pilots' union had rejected its offer to hold talks.
Ryanair refuses to compensate passengers for 'unreasonable' strikes
The airline said it issued notices of possible redundancy to 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew after its board approved a 
plan to cut its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.
"This unfortunate and entirely avoidable decision by Ryanair can be interpreted at best as a very immature 
response to legitimate strike action," said Dirk Polloczek, president of the European Cockpit Association (ECA).
"At worst as a bold attempt at union busting and an effort to put maximum pressure on pilots to stop industrial 
action," Polloczek added.
Philip von Schoeppenthau, the ECA's secretary general, said the airline's "provocation and unnecessary behaviour 
will only encourage even more pilots to leave Ryanair for competitor airlines."
"The myth of union-friendly Ryanair is falling apart," von Schoeppenthau said, accusing the airline of "reverting to its 
previous anti-union tactics, while claiming publicly to constructively engage with its unions."

Budget airline Ryanair warned staff in Ireland that up to 300 jobs could be lost this winter, as strikes by cabin crew 
affected its flights in three other countries on Wednesday.
The airline said it had issued notices of possible redundancy to 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew after its board 
approved a plan to cut its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft this winter.
If the cut goes ahead, the airline will offer transfers to Poland, and possibly other bases, to "minimize any 
redundancies," Ryanair said.
The airline's chief operating officer, Peter Bellew, suggested the move was partly linked to "forward bookings being 
damaged by rolling strikes by Irish pilots."
Bellew said potential job cuts would be "a deeply regretted consequence" of any damage to Ryanair's "reputation 
for reliability or forward bookings" from its fleet of more than 450 aircraft in 87 European bases.
In a quarterly report on Monday, the airline criticized "unnecessary strikes" by about 25 per cent of Irish-based pilots 
this month.
Ryanair also cancelled 600 flights scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday due to a strike by cabin crew in three 
countries.
"We apologize to the 50,000 Belgium, Spain and Portugal customers whose flights today were cancelled," the 
airline tweeted on Wednesday.
It said all other scheduled Ryanair flights were "operating as normal" on Wednesday, but air-traffic control staff 
shortages in France, Germany and Greece delayed 50 of the airline's 345 early morning flights.

Ryanair reported a 20-per-cent fall in profits in the first quarter of its financial year on Monday, blaming lower fares 
and higher fuel and pilot costs, but the low-cost airline insisted that it remains on track to hit its annual target.
The airline said its net profit dropped to 319 million euros (373 million dollars) in the quarter ended June 30, as 
average fares fell 4 per cent amid some overcapacity in Europe and an early Easter peak.
Higher fuel and staff costs, and strikes by Ryanair pilots and international air traffic controllers (ATC), also affected 
financial performance, it said.
"Traffic grew 7 per cent, to 37.6 million, despite over 2,500 flight cancellations caused by ATC staff shortages and 
ATC strikes," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
But Ryanair's low fares delivered "an industry-leading 96-per-cent load factor," O'Leary said.
Ryanair said it still expected to achieve its annual profit forecast of 1.25 billion euros to 1.35 billion euros.
The airline said it had introduced measures to make Ryanair more attractive to pilots and cabin crew, including a 
pay increase, improved training and trade union recognition.
Despite signing union recognition agreements in Britain and Italy, and in Germany for cabin crew, the airline said it 
still suffered two "unnecessary strikes" by about 25 per cent of Irish-based pilots this month, while cabin crew have 
threatened strikes in Spain, Portugal and Belgium.
"If these unnecessary strikes continue to damage customer confidence and forward prices/yields in certain country 
markets, then we will have to review our winter schedule," it warned.

Ryanair cancels 600 flights for next week as strike looms

Low-cost airline Ryanair has cancelled 600 flights scheduled for the coming week due to the threat of impending 
strikes by cabin crew, the carrier announced Wednesday.
Some 50,000 passengers will be affected by the cancellations next Wednesday and Thursday, Ryanair said on 
Twitter.
The move would affect 200 flights to and from Spain on each of the days, as well as 50 each for Portugal and 
Belgium, together accounting for around 12 per cent of the airline's total European flight network.
Ryanair's flight attendants are walking out following a call by the cabin crews' respective unions in each of the three 
countries.
Whether German airports are affected by the failures, the airline could not say. Affected passengers would be 
informed.
Ryanair's employees are seeking higher salaries and an improvement in working conditions. The company's Irish 
pilots are also planning to strike this Friday and next Tuesday.
Affected passengers were informed by e-mail or text messages, and have been offered re-bookings or a full refund, 
Ryanair said.
According to company spokesman Kenny Jacobs, the strikes were unjustified, and would only disrupt family 
vacations and benefit the competition.
The flight attendants currently receive salaries of up to 40,000 euros (46,600 dollars) a year, he added.

A Ryanair flight carrying 189 passengers from Dublin to the Croatian city of Zadar was diverted to Frankfurt-Hahn 
airport in Germany after a sudden loss in cabin pressure, police said Saturday.
Thirty-three passengers were taken to area hospitals. "The passengers complained of headaches and earaches, 
and suffered from nausea," a German federal police spokesman told dpa.
Other passengers spent the night at the airport.
On Saturday morning, a replacement aircraft departed to complete the trip to Zadar. However, 22 passengers could 
not fly for medical reasons, and would be taken to Zadar by bus, police said.
What exactly happened on board the Boeing 737 was not known.
"Experts must now clarify that, but that can take some time," the police spokesman said.
The plane landed at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport at 11:30 pm (2130 GMT) Friday night.
A passenger told German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that there was a not-too-loud bang and a 
sudden drop in temperature inside the plane.
Oxygen masks dropped from above the seats before the crew announced there would be an emergency descent. 
While there had at first been some panic on board, everyone remained calm in the end.
Many passengers experienced earaches, while others reported bleeding from their ears. One woman was carried 
away on a stretcher.

In a statement, Ryanair said the reason for the emergency landing was an "inflight depressurization." The airline did 
not provide any details on the exact cause of the incident, nor did it comment on the health of the passengers.
"A pressure drop can happen from time to time, but it only rarely leads to real problems," a spokesman for a 
German pilots' association, Janis Georg Schmitt, told dpa.
It does not put the aircraft in any danger of crashing, and instances of a pressure loss are regularly practised in 
flight simulators, he added.

Lufthansa on Friday recalled nine planes it has leased to Laudamotion, a day after Ryanair was given the go-ahead 
by European Union competition authorities to take over the Austrian budget carrier.
Justifying the step, Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, said Laudamotion had "repeatedly 
failed to make the agreed payments." The recall has yet to take effect.
The nine planes make up almost half the fleet of Laudamotion, the former Air Berlin subsidiary that used to be 
known as Niki.
Lufthansa, which had wanted to buy Niki from Air Berlin but withdrew from the bidding in December last year, said it 
could make good use of the planes in its own budget carrier, Eurowings.
Speaking to Austrian news agency APA, Laudamotion chief executive Andreas Gruber insisted it had paid all its 
bills related to the planes.
The payments for July had been met at the end of June, and all nine planes were in full use, Gruber said.
Dublin-based Ryanair accused Lufthansa of delaying payments of 1.5 million euros to Laudamotion, terming the 
cancellation of the leases as yet another attempt by Lufthansa "to destabilize and cause damage."
It also said Lufthansa had failed to make available all the planes promised. Lufthansa rejected this.
The European Commission gave the takeover the go-ahead without setting any conditions.

Ryanair, which operates throughout Europe, is to take a 75 per cent stake in the Austrian carrier, which flies 
primarily from Germany, Austria and Switzerland to holiday destinations in the Mediterranean and Canary Islands.

Austrian entrepreneur and former Formula One racer Niki Lauda originally founded the airline under the name Niki 
in 2003 and sold it to the Air Berlin group in 2011. Following Air Berlin's bankruptcy last year, he bought it back in 
January and re-established it as Laudamotion with the help of British travel company Thomas Cook.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sees the investment as a way to expand business in the German-speaking 
market, which is dominated by Lufthansa.

Ryanair cabin staff have agreed to go on strike on July 25 and 26 in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain, a 
consortium of trade unions announced on Thursday, following talks in Brussels.
Employees at Europe's largest budget airline have long demanded better pay and working conditions.
Trade unions from Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy convened Thursday's talks after Ryanair missed an end-of-
June deadline to apply national labour laws, enter into negotiations with them and apply the same conditions to all 
cabin crew, the unions said in a statement.
"Regretfully, Ryanair chose to continue to ignore its workforce and gave these unions no other choice but to call for 
a national 24 hours strike action," the statement said.
Ryanair cabin crews are due to strike in all four countries on July 25, with Italian staff resuming work on July 26 
while the Belgian, Spanish and Portuguese workforce continue their industrial action.
Unions in other European countries might also take action in the coming weeks, the statement said, noting that 
"legal restrictions and extensive bureaucratic procedures," were currently preventing them from doing so.
The statement calls on the European Commission and EU governments to act against Ryanair's labour practices, 
while urging the European Aviation Safety Agency and its national counterparts to be "more vigilant with Ryanair 
and make them abide by the law."
The statement was signed by the CNE and LBC unions in Belgium, SITCPLA and USO in Spain, the SNPVAC in 
Portugal and Italy's Uiltrasporti union.

The government of Norway said on Wednesday it has sold its remaining shares in Scandinavian airline SAS, 
ending its seven-decade long interest in the firm.
The Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries said the sale of Norway's almost 10-per-cent-stake was 
worth about 597 million kroner (73 million dollars).
Prior to the sale, conducted in an auction late Tuesday, the Norwegian state was the third-largest shareholder in the 
carrier, formed in 1946.
"The government has long stated that it was not a long-term owner of SAS. Parliament has on several occasions 
authorized the government to sell off its holdings," Torbjorn Roe Isaken, minister of trade and industry said in a 
statement.
Buyers included investors from Norway and other countries, the ministry said.
"SAS has recently had a positive development, and I believe firmly that the company will continue to work to 
improve its competitive edge," the minister added.
Other main owners include the governments of Denmark and Sweden, which, together, own 29 per cent in SAS.
Sweden has also said it was open to sell its stake, but Danish Finance Minister Kristian Jensen said in a comment 
Wednesday to Danish news agency Ritzau that Denmark had no immediate plans to sell.
SAS has, in recent years, experienced increased competition from  low-cost carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle, 
Ryanair and Wizzair.

The Cockpit union of German pilots has broken off pay talks with budget airline Ryanair, accusing the Ireland-based 
company of being uncooperative, a Cockpit spokesman said in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
Ryanair representatives had failed to arrive for agreed appointments, the spokesman said.
A strike now looms at the German locations operated by Europe's largest budget carrier. Cockpit has initiated a 
ballot of its members working for Ryanair, the spokesman said.
Dublin-based Ryanair is facing conflict with its pilots in Ireland as well.

Europe's largest budget airline Ryanair has reported improved profits in the 2017 fiscal year despite lower ticket 
prices and September's mismanagement of pilot schedules.
From April 2017 to March 2018, a 10-per-cent increase in after-tax profit to 1.45 billion euros (1.7 billion dollars) 
was reported by the Irish airline in a statement released on Monday.
"We are pleased to report a 10-per-cent increase in profits, with an unchanged net margin of 20 per cent," said 
CEO Michael O'Leary, who also acknowledged the difficulties of the September 2017 "rostering management 
failure."
Ryanair cancelled around 20,000 flights in the autumn after failing to accommodate for a backlog of holidays for its 
crew, which caused a number of strikes by employees across Europe.
Despite the crisis, the airline still logged over 130 million passengers in 2017, filling 95 per cent of their available 
seats, an industry high.
While O'Leary expects even more passengers in the coming year, he also warns of higher costs for pilots, crew and 
fuel.

Alexis von Hoensbroech will become Austrian Airlines' new chief executive in August, the subsidiary of German 
carrier Lufthansa announced Wednesday.
The 47-year-old manager is currently an executive board member at Lufthansa's cargo firm.
He succeeds Kay Kratky, who was likewise installed by Lufthansa to run the Austrian flag carrier. Kratky will leave 
his post upon turning 60.
"Alexis has the perfect know-how to lead Austrian Airlines in the next phase and establish it as a profitable premium 
carrier in the highly competitive Austrian market," said Harry Hohmeister, the senior Lufthansa manager who 
oversees the Swiss and Austrian Airlines subsidiaries.
Austrian Airlines' operating profit jumped 55 per cent to 101 million euros (125 million dollars) last year, thanks to 
the bankruptcies of budget carrier Air Berlin and its Austrian subsidiary Niki.
However, Niki has been re-established as Laudamotion this year, and Ryanair has announced that it plans to take 
over a majority stake of the new airline, to establish strong competition for the Lufthansa group in the German-
speaking market.

New Austrian budget airline Laudamotion said Monday that it is ending its cooperation with travel group Thomas 
Cook and its carrier Condor, amid Ryanair's plans to take over the Vienna-based firm.
British travel firm Thomas Cook and its Germany-based subsidiary Condor had helped to launch Laudamotion by 
marketing the nascent airline's seats on their platforms.
Austrian entrepreneur and former Formula One racer Niki Lauda originally founded the airline under the name Niki 
in 2003 and sold it to the Air Berlin group in 2011.
After Air Berlin's bankruptcy, he bought it back in January and re-established it as Laudamotion with the help of 
Thomas Cook.
However, Lauda presented large Irish carrier Ryanair as an investor only weeks later in March.
Europe's biggest low cost airline said it would buy 24.9 per cent of Vienna-based Laudamotion at first, and would 
expand its stake to 75 per cent as soon as possible, pending approval from the EU market watchdog.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sees the investment as a way to expand business in the German-speaking 
market, which is dominated by Lufthansa.

New Austrian carrier Laudamotion aims for a top spot among Europe's budget airlines, Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary announced Wednesday in Vienna.
Irish budget carrier Ryanair owns 24.9 per cent of Laudamotion and plans to increase its stake to 75 per cent soon.
O'Leary told a press conference that Laudamotion's fleet should double to 40 aircraft within two or three years.
The Vienna-based airline is the successor of Niki, the subsidiary of failed German carrier Air Berlin.
Laudamotion flies from seven German airports as well as Vienna and Zurich to vacation destinations in southern 
Europe.
O'Leary expects the new airline to make losses in it first two years.
"We hope to make money in the third year," he said.
Former Formula One champion and entrepreneur Niki Lauda, who heads Laudamotion, strongly denied allegations 
that he had merely acted as a frontman for others when he bought Niki.
Ryanair's investment was announced on March 20, only weeks after Lauda won the bid for Niki. In addition to the 
deal with Ryanair, Lauda has decided to lease several of his aircraft to German carrier Lufthansa at least until the 
end of May.
"I do not comment on stupid comments. We are an Austrian firm and a European airline," he said.
Laudamotion aims to become key player among Europe's budget airlines
Lauda founded Niki in 2003. After selling it to the Air Berlin group in 2011, he bought it back in January and 
renamed it Laudamotion.

Ryanair challenges Lufthansa with Laudamotion takeover plan

Europe's biggest budget airline, Ryanair, on Tuesday announced an agreement to take over a majority of nascent 
carrier Laudamotion - a deal that challenges rival Lufthansa on the German market.
Dublin-based Ryanair said it planned to take over 75 per cent of Laudamotion, only weeks after Austrian 
businessman Niki Lauda bought the carrier back from insolvent German budget airline Air Berlin.
One of Laudamotion's main hubs is Dusseldorf in western Germany, which is also the seat of Lufthansa's budget 
subsidiary Eurowings.
"I stand for competition, and everyone knows my critical stance towards monopolies," former Formula One 
champion Lauda told a press conference in Dusseldorf, referring to Lufthansa's market dominance in German-
speaking countries.
Ryanair said it would buy 24.9 per of Vienna-based Laudamotion at first, and would expand its stake as soon as 
possible, pending approval from the EU market watchdog.
Ryanair said it will pay a sum below 50 million euros (61.5 million dollars) for the 75 per cent, in addition to 50 
million dollars to fund Laudamotion's start-up and operating costs during its first year in business.
In addition, Ryanair will lease six of its aircraft and crews to Laudamotion, which will increase its fleet to 21 aircraft.
While Laudamotion is currently focused on flying holidaymakers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland to 
Mediterranean destinations, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said that he wants Laudamotion to offer 
regular scheduled flights to other destinations in the future.
Ryanair challenges Lufthansa with Laudamotion takeover plan
Ryanair's aircraft and funding would allow Laudamotion "to compete in a market which is dominated by Lufthansa's 
high airfares with its Swiss and Austrian subsidiaries," he said.
Lauda founded Niki in 2003. After selling it to the Air Berlin group in 2011, he bought it back in January and 
renamed it Laudamotion.
Lufthansa had also tried to buy Niki, but abandoned its bid after the European Commission signalled that it would 
block the deal because of competition worries.

Irish budget airline Ryanair's marketing director warned on Tuesday that unions may disrupt their move to fill the 
gap in the market left by insolvent flight company Air Berlin.
"When you now have unions and you have union recognition, you can have some disruption," said Kenny Jacobs at 
a press conference in Berlin.
"We haven't had that yet, but we are saying it can happen at some point in the future."
Ryanair is planning to expand the number of services it runs to and from German airports from 24 to 243 by next 
winter.
This year the company aims to see a 13-per-cent increase of passengers flying from German airports, with the total 
rising to 19.7 million.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary is due to meet German aviation union Vereinigung Cockpit.
In December Ryanair agreed to recognize pilot unions for the first time as part of efforts to avoid planned strike 
action during the Christmas holiday season.
Various European budget airlines have made overtures to fill the gap left by the dissolution of German flight 
company Air Berlin after it stopped trading last October.
According to Lufthansa sister company Eurowings' own information, the firm plans to roll its service out with another 
70,000 flights carrying an additional 8 million passengers this year.

Scandinavian airline SAS on Tuesday reported a first-quarter net loss of 239 million kronor (29 million dollars), 
noting however that it more than halved its losses compared to a year ago.
The net loss in the period for November 2016 to January 2017 was 557 million kronor.
The first quarter is traditionally the airline's weakest.
The lower net loss was attributed to "seasonal adaptations, efficiency enhancements and advantageous currency 
movements," chief executive Richard Gustafson said in a comment.
Revenue in the quarter was 8.95 billion kronor, a slight increase compared to a year ago.
During the period, SAS said it flew about 6 million passengers, a decrease of roughly 5 per cent year-on-year.
The airline - whose main owners are the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden - said capacity for flights to 
and from as well as in Scandinavia increased during the first quarter. This was mainly driven by low-cost carriers 
such as Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair and Wizzair.

Almost 4.6 million passengers passed through Germany's largest airport near Frankfurt in January, up 7.6 per cent 
on the year, according to figures released by the operating company Fraport on Tuesday.
The figure was a record for the month, the company said, adding that the gaps created in the German market by 
the bankruptcy of Air Berlin had been closed. The budget carrier initiated insolvency proceedings in August.
New routes to European destinations led to an increase in flight movements of 8.6 per cent, with additional routes 
provided by budget carriers Ryanair and Wizz leading the rise.
Among the new offerings were classical holiday destinations around the Mediterranean, including Turkey, where 
there was evident growth for the first time since the start of the financial crisis.
Long-haul routes grew less strongly at 2.6 per cent, although there was a rise in flights to South Korea ahead of the 
Winter Olympics.

A shuttle bus transporting travellers from their plane to a terminal at Frankfurt Airport in south-western Germany 
collided with a hauler on Thursday, leaving more than a dozen people injured.
The driver of the hauling vehicle and 13 flight passengers were injured in the crash, with one passenger brought to 
the hospital, police said.
It was unclear how the accident at Germany's largest airport happened, though an initial investigation suggested 
that the hauler ignored the bus' right of way.
The shuttle bus' 72 travellers had arrived on a Ryanair flight from Seville in southern Spain, according to airport 
operator Fraport.
The cost of the collision damages could not immediately be assessed, according to police.

The arrival of Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair and growth for major airlines like Lufthansa have delivered a record 
number of passengers for Germany's largest airport in Frankfurt.
Strong numbers in December also helped to lift the number of passengers that passed through Frankfurt to 64.5 
million in 2017, which was an increase of 6.1 per cent on 2016, airport operator Fraport said Monday.
Fraport head Stefan Schulte had previously forecast a 5-per-cent rise in passenger numbers.
In 2016, the airport actually saw a drop in passenger numbers and responded by redirecting its focus to low-coast 
carriers like Ryanair.
There was also a 3.8-per-cent annual rise in cargo handled at Frankfurt airport in 2017, which reached 2.2 million 
tons of freight and post.

Irish budget airliner Ryanair apologized to its customers that one in four of its flights had been delayed early Friday, 
following a four-hour pilots' strike that it referred to as "unneccessary."
The strike, organized by the German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC), lasted from 5 pm (0400 GMT) to 9 am, 
but only a small number of pilots participated, meaning that no flights had to be cancelled and only nine of 36 were 
delayed, the airline said.
The action formed part of a long-running dispute over wokring conditions.
The pilots' decision in Germany came after Ryanair held its first-ever negotiations with unions on Wednesday, 
which helped to avert planned pan-European industrial action by the airline's pilots.

Pilots in Germany employed by budget airline Ryanair plan to mount the first strike in the carrier's more than 30-
year corporate history on Friday, just as the group enters the final days of the crucial Christmas holiday season.
The pilots plan to hold a warning strike between 5 am and 9 am (0400 and 0800 GMT) on all of the Irish carrier's 
services from German airports.
The action forms part of a long-running dispute over conditions, the pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said on 
Thursday.
"Ryanair continues to play for time and as a result prevents the launch of collective bargaining," said VC negotiator 
Ingolf Schumacher.
The pilots' decision in Germany came after Ryanair held its first-ever negotiations with unions on Wednesday, 
which helped to avert planned pan-European industrial action by the airline's pilots.
Earlier Thursday, Ryanair said it planned to hold more talks with the German union next month.
"Ryanair has written today to the VC union on a number of outstanding issues arising from the meeting in Dublin 
yesterday," the company said in a statement.
It agreed to meet the union in Frankfurt on January 5 to "progress and resolve these issues, which Ryanair expects 
will lead to a collective labour agreement (CLA) for Ryanair's pilots in Germany." 
The Ryanair pilots in Germany said they had wanted to join their counterparts in Ireland, Italy as well as Portugal 
and mount a strike on Wednesday.

However, the group cancelled the strikes after Ryanair's offer to talk about the trade unions' complaints, covering 
areas such as the carrier's strategy as well as pay and employment models in the fast-growing budget airline 
industry.
Ryanair said it had written to the Impact union in Ireland on Thursday to confirm recognition of the union and a joint 
council for Irish pilots.
The airline said it had tabled proposals on pay and conditions, procedures and dispute resolution for Irish-based 
pilots, and "looks forward to concluding an early agreement on these issues with its Irish Ryanair pilot company 
council."
Until Thursday, Ryanair had essentially refused to recognize trade unions as representatives of their employees.
Instead, the low-cost airline, which was founded in 1985, has only held talks with local pilot committees from across 
its European operations.
According to the German pilots' union, Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no 
guaranteed work schedule, no retirement planning and a widely used system of registering pilots as self-employed.

Former Formula One champion and entrepreneur Niki Lauda is one of the four parties who has placed a bid for Niki 
airline, Air Berlin's insolvent subsidiary, his spokeswoman said on Thursday.
The other bidding parties were Tuifly, travel group Thomas Cook and British Airways parent company IAG, 
according to information obtained by dpa.
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair and the German freight company Zeitfracht announced that they would not place bids 
of their own, despite signalling earlier that they were interested in the Austria-based carrier.
However, Zeitfracht, as well as German aircraft service firm Nayak, said they would like to cooperate with Niki's 
potential buyers.
Niki Lauda had founded the airline under his name in 2003 but sold it to now-insolvent Air Berlin in 2011.
The Austrian airline with around 1,000 employees was deemed a particularly lucrative part of the Air Berlin 
company.
Earlier this month, major aviation industry player Lufthansa pulled out of a potential purchase of Niki after the 
European Commission signalled it might object due to concerns over a monopoly.
The Vienna-based Niki mainly served European and North African vacation destinations.

further and also recognize flight assistants' unions, a top executive said in a Saturday interview.
"We are not bluffing. [Yesterday] our shares lost 7 per cent on the stock market and therefore we are very serious: 
for us this is a great step change compared to the past and we will not go back," Chief Operating Officer Peter 
Bellew told Italy's La Repubblica daily.
Ryanair's move was announced on Friday, after pilots' unions in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal 
threatened unprecedented industrial action in the run-up to the Christmas holidays against unsatisfactory working 
conditions.
Bellew, whose predecessor resigned in October amid flight cancellations chaos forced by pilot shortages, said the 
budget airline opted for "dialogue" because it did not "want to put at risk [its] customers' Christmas."
He said that talks with pilots' unions would start next week, or in January at the latest, in all of Ryanair's European 
hubs, but he also said the company was not prepared to extend talks to flight assistants, who also demand union 
recognition.
"We are only talking to pilots," Bellew said.
According to the German pilots' union, Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no 
obligatory work schedule, no retirement planning and a widely prevalent system of pseudo-self-employed pilots.
In the La Repubblica interview, Bellew insisted that self-employed pilots only make up 24 per cent of Ryanair's total.

Budget airline Ryanair said Friday it has agreed to recognize pilot unions in "a significant change" that is part of 
efforts to avoid planned strike action during the Christmas holiday season.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said he had written to the unions "inviting them to talks to recognize them and calling 
on them to cancel the threatened industrial action planned for Christmas week."
The recognition of pilots unions was a reversal of the company's previous stance.
O'Leary said that if strikes could be avoided by talking to the "pilots through a recognized union process, then we 
are prepared to do so."
The Irish airline is facing the prospect of Europe-wide pilot strikes for the first time in its history. Earlier this year, it 
was hit by the cancellation of thousands of flights due to staffing problems.
"We wish to remove any worry or concern that [customers] may be disrupted by pilot industrial action," O'Leary's 
statement read.
The airline said it has contacted pilot unions in Ireland, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.
Walkouts and strike action were mooted earlier this week by pilot unions in these countries.
The German pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit (VC), said in an initial reaction Friday it would consider the 
negotiation offer.
More details were expected later Friday, the pilots' union said in an emailed statement to dpa.
Ryanair to recognize pilots unions in bid to avoid strikes
On Tuesday, the German pilots' union said walkouts would take place in the airline's 10 German hubs, without 
naming exact dates. It pledged to give passengers advance warning and not strike during the prime Christmas 
holiday period of December 23-26.
A spokesman for the Impact trade union in Ireland, with which the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) is 
affiliated, said it would give the offer "full consideration," when it received the letter, the Press Association news 
agency reported.
IALPA earlier this week announced plans for a 24-hour strike involving dozens of Ryanair pilots on December 20.
Labour action was also due in Portugal and Italy.
The unions in Italy, Portugal and Ireland accuse Ryanair, founded in 1985, of operating with unsatisfactory working 
conditions under Irish law for around 4,000 pilots.
Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no obligatory work schedule, no retirement 
planning and a widely prevalent system of pseudo self-employed pilots, VC's Schulz said this week.

Budget airline Ryanair announced "a significant change" on Friday, saying it has agreed to recognize pilot unions 
as part of efforts to avoid planned strike action during the Christmas holiday season.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said he had written to the unions "inviting them to talks to recognize them and calling 
on them to cancel the threatened industrial action planned for Christmas week."
Pilot unions reacted cautiously to the offer, but Italy's biggest airline pilots union, ANPAC, called off a strike 
scheduled for Friday after Ryanair agreed to recognize their organization.
"It is a very important first step," ANPAC said in a statement, welcoming the budget airline's decision. However, it 
urged Ryanair to also recognize unions for flight assistants, also represented by ANPAC.
Meanwhile, another Italian flight assistants union, Fit-Cisl, went ahead with a separate four-hour strike because it 
had received no offer of recognition from Ryanair.
Italian industry minister Carlo Calenda, who earlier this week criticized Ryanair for its "indecent" stance against 
unions and the right to strike, commented on Friday's decision to recognize unions: "It is not a concession [...] it is 
the bare minumum and it is not enough," he told the La7 TV channel.
"If Ryanair wants to remain in Italy it must do it respecting the rules and the [workers'] rights that apply in Italy," 
Calenda added.
The recognition of pilots unions was a reversal of Ryanair's long-standing stance.

Labour action was also planned in Portugal, according to the pilot union SPAC.
Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA), which represents about 85 per 
cent of the over 10,000 commercial pilots flying in Britain, tweeted he had also received an offer of "recognition

Irish budget carrier Ryanair confirmed Friday that it is looking into buying insolvent Austria-based rival Niki.
"Ryanair confirmed today that it had contacted the administrators of Niki Luftfahrt GmbH in respect of the 
insolvency process and the potential purchase of remaining Niki assets," the company said.
Besides Ryanair, two other potential bidders have come forward: Condor, which belongs to the British travel group 
Thomas Cook; and former Formula One racer Niki Lauda, who originally founded Niki before selling it to Air Berlin.
Niki declared itself insolvent and stopped flying on Wednesday, after after German flag carrier Lufthansa 
abandoned its bid to acquire the subsidiary of the now insolvent Air Berlin.
Lufthansa lost interest because EU monopoly authorities opposed the deal on competition grounds.
In early December, the European Commission approved the takeover of certain Air Berlin assets by British low-cost 
carrier Easyjet.

Irish budget airline Ryanair faces the prospect of Europe-wide pilot strikes for the first time in the company's history.
The German pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit (VC), said Tuesday the walkouts would take place in the airline's 10 
German hubs without naming exact dates. Passengers would be informed ahead of time and spared labour action 
during the Christmas holidays of December 23-26, VC President Ilja Schulz said in Frankfurt.
Unions in Portugal and Italy called for strikes earlier in the day, with Ryanair pilots in Italy threatening to walk off the 
job for four hours on Friday.
The Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) said Tuesday that a 24-hour strike involving dozens of Ryanair pilots 
would take place on December 20. It cited Ryanair's refusal to enter into direct negotiations with the European 
Employee Representative Council (EERC) or IALPA as the sole representative body for pilots at the company.
The unions in Italy, Portugal and Ireland accuse Ryanair, founded in 1985, of operating with unsatisfactory working 
conditions under Irish law for around 4,000 pilots.
Ryanair offers no continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, no obligatory work schedule, no retirement 
planning and a widely prevalent system of pseudo self-employed pilots, VC's Schulz said.
Ryanair categorically rejected negotiations with the IALPA and the VC despite the threat of strikes.

Pilots employed by Irish budget airline Ryanair in Germany plan to join their counterparts in other parts of Europe 
and launch industrial action, a potential threat to the carrier's services during the Christmas travel period.
However, the German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit did not nominate a date when announcing the strike action 
on Tuesday.
The strike action did not include the Christmas holiday period, the union said.
Ryanair pilots in Italy, Portugal and its base in Ireland have already announced plans to walk off the job because of 
a long-running dispute with the airline about conditions.
While the union has backed the pilots' demand for a special commission to try to settle the dispute, the no-frills 
airline has so far not been prepared to join any negotiations.

The European Commission has approved the takeover of certain assets from the insolvent airline Air Berlin by the 
British low-cost carrier Easyjet.
The commissioner in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said Tuesday that Easyjet's plans will not 
reduce competition.
"Our decision enables Easyjet to grow its presence at Berlin airports and start competing on new routes to the 
benefit of consumers," Vestager said.
Easyjet's move to expand its German services follows Air Berlin's collapse in August, which subsequently freed up 
airport landing slots.
Easyjet proposed to acquire certain assets and rights held by Air Berlin as part of its previous operations at Berlin 
Tegel airport, including landing and take-off permission at a specific date and time at Tegel airport and at some 
destination airports, according to an EU statement.
The commission investigation concluded that Easyjet will continue to face strong competition from large carriers like 
Lufthansa and Ryanair on routes from and to Berlin.

Budget airline Ryanair risks a fine of up to 5 million euros (5.9 million dollars) for failing to properly inform customers 
hit by flight cancellations, Italy's antitrust regulator said Monday.
In September, Ryanair attracted widespread criticism as it was forced to cancel tens of thousands of flights to 
accommodate a backlog of holidays for pilots.
Italy's competition authority AGCM said it ordered the airline to clearly advertise to Italian customers affected by the 
cancellations the options available to them.
In such cases, passengers have a right to obtain refunds or be booked onto another flight for free, but may also 
claim financial compensation, the regulator recalled in a statement.
Since Ryanair did not meet a 10-day deadline to tell AGCM how it was going to comply with the regulator's October 
25 order, an infringement procedure against the airline was opened.
"The infringement procedure that was started can lead to the application of an administrative sanction ranging from 
10,000 euros to 5 million euros," AGCM said.

Ryanair on Tuesday reported an 11-per-cent rise in half-yearly profit but said the cancellation of thousands of flights 
due to pilot rostering problems could cost the budget airline up to 100 million euros in this financial year.
The number of passengers also grew by 11 per cent year-on-year from April to September, but the grounding of 25 
planes after the pilot rostering chaos will slow growth in the next six months, the airline said.
It said half-yearly revenue rose by 7 per cent to 4.43 billion euros, while profit after tax reached 1.29 billion euros, 
up 11 per cent.
"These strong H1 results reinforce the robust nature of Ryanair's low-fare, pan-European growth model even during 
a period which suffered a material failure in our pilot rostering function in early September," said chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary said Ryanair expected growth in passenger traffic to slow to about 4 per cent in the next six months, with 
full-year traffic falling from 131 million to 129 million customers.
He said the airline remains "concerned at the continuing uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK's departure 
from the EU in March 2019."
"There remains a worrying risk of a serious disruption to UK-EU flights in April 2019 unless a timely UK-EU bilateral 
is agreed in advance of September 2018," O'Leary said.
"We, like other airlines, need clarity on this issue before we publish our summer 2019 schedules in mid-2018 and 
time is running short for the UK to develop a bilateral solution."

German airline Lufthansa presented an offer on Monday to buy part of the operations of beleaguered Italian 
counterpart Alitalia, which is going through bankruptcy procedures.
"Lufthansa has opted not to make an offer for the complete airline, but has stated interest in only parts of the global 
network traffic and European and domestic point-to-point business," a statement read.
The terms of the offer are confidential, but include "a concept for a newly structured Alitalia with a focused business 
model ... which could develop long-term economic prospects," Lufthansa added.
The statement came ahead of a 6 pm (1600 GMT) deadline for binding offers for Alitalia, and after Italian daily 
Corriere della Sera said Lufthansa's bid was worth around 500 million euros (590 million dollars).
The newspaper also said Lufthansa was looking at slashing Alitalia's workforce of 12,000 by half, and that the 
Italian government, which is expected to influence the sale to at least some extent, was unhappy at the extent of the 
proposed layoffs.
Last week, Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr expressed an interest in a "newly positioned Alitalia," 
describing the company as not economically viable in its current state.
Spohr was speaking after Lufthansa took over insolvent German airline Air Berlin for 210 million euros, part of a 
1.5-billion-euro investment to revive the company.
Like Alitalia, Air Berlin used to be 49-per-cent owned by United Arab Emirates carrier Etihad, which has decided to 
stop investing in the two loss-making European airlines.
Germany 's Lufthansa offers to buy parts of bankrupt Alitalia
The former Italian flag carrier filed for insolvency in May and is being propped up by bridge loans from the national 
government. The company was given a further 300 million euros on Friday.
On the same day, the Italian government extended the deadline for the sale of the company to April 30, to allow 
more time to find a suitable buyer.
Ryanair had also initially expressed an interest in purchasing a deeply restructured Alitalia, but pulled out of the 
bidding process in late September after it became embroiled in its own flight cancellations fiasco.

Flights cancelled as French public sector strikes over cuts
Flights cancelled as French public sector strikes over cuts

At least 1,000 flights were expected to be cancelled by the end of Tuesday as French public sector workers 
launched a one-day strike against cost-cutting measures.
Unions are angered by government decisions to freeze pay for 2018, to make staff bear the cost of their first day of 
sick leave and to cut social employment schemes.
French public servants are also worried by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to reduce the 5.45-million-strong 
public sector workforce by 120,000 over his five-year term.
Macron already faced two days of strikes and protests last month over decrees making French labour law more 
flexible for private sector employees.
The hardline CGT union and leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon called the September strike action, which fell 
somewhat flat even as police estimated attendance at 223,000.
Tuesday's strike, by contrast, is backed by all the main public sector unions.
As thousands of protesters took to the streets in Paris and other major cities, the Education Ministry said that 17.5 
per cent of school teachers had joined the strike.
The health service saw more limited action. The Paris public hospitals body saying only 4.8 per cent of its staff were 
on strike, almost half of whom had been called in to work anyway under rules to preserve services in the health 
sector.
European airline lobby group Airlines for Europe warned that at least 1,000 flights were set to be cancelled due to 
strike action by air traffic controllers.
Flights cancelled as French public sector strikes over cuts
The disruption would affect flights passing through French airspace or hit by knock-on delays as well as those to 
and from French airports, spokesman Aage Duenhaupt said.
Almost a third of flights were set to be cancelled at major French airports including Paris Charles de Gaulle, Paris 
Orly, Beauvais, Nice and Marseille.
Air France said it would run all long-distance flights from the two Paris airports but only about 75 per cent of short-
haul and medium-haul flights.
Easyjet said it expected a number of delays and cancellations starting on Monday evening and would inform 
affected customers directly. Ryanair announced more than 230 cancellations.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has promised to take public sector concerns into account and compensate civil 
servants for a rise in a social security tax, but his overtures have not convinced the unions.

French public sector workers took to the streets Tuesday to protest cost-cutting measures, with an airline alliance 
warning the strike action was likely to cause the cancellation of least 1,000 flights.
Unions are angered by government decisions to freeze pay for 2018, to make staff bear the cost of their first day of 
sick leave and to cut social employment schemes.
Public servants are also worried by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to reduce the 5.45-million-strong public 
sector workforce by 120,000 over his five-year term.
Some 209,000 protesters took to the streets across France, according to the Interior Ministry. The hardline CGT 
union put the figure at 400,000.
Macron already faced two days of strikes and protests last month over decrees making French labour law more 
flexible for private sector employees.
The CGT and leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon called the September strike action, which fell somewhat flat even 
as police estimated attendance at 223,000.
Tuesday's strike, by contrast, was backed by all the main public sector unions. The impact on public services was 
limited, however, with air traffic and the education sector the most affected.

Ryanair's operations chief has resigned and will leave the company at the end of October, the budget airline said on 
Saturday, amid widespread criticism of its cancellation of tens of thousands of flights.
Michael Hickey "will work on an orderly handover of his responsibilities" over the next three weeks while the airline 
finds a successor, Ryanair said in a statement.
"Over the past 30 years Mick Hickey has made an enormous contribution to Ryanair, especially the quality and 
safety of our engineering and operations functions," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Hickey will "complete a number of large projects he is currently working on including a multiyear engine 
maintenance contract and new hangar projects in Seville and Madrid," O'Leary said.
The resignation follows Ryanair's announcement that it plans to cut tens of thousands of flights over the next six 
months, including about 18,000 flights this month to accommodate a backlog of holidays for pilots. 
Hickey joined Ryanair as an engineer in 1988, rising through management to become director of engineering in 
2000 and chief operations officer in 2014, the company said.

The rights of airline passengers flying with Ryanair "need to be protected," Ireland's prime minister said Friday, in 
the wake of the budget carrier cancelling thousands of flights.
Ryanair announced this month that it would cancel about 18,000 flights until the end of October to accommodate for 
a backlog of holidays for its crew.
On Wednesday, the airline said that it would also cut 25 planes, or 6 per cent of its fleet, this winter as it slows its 
planned growth in light of the mass cancellations.
"I think it's as simple as this: people's and passengers' rights need to be protected," Irish Prime Minister Leo 
Varadkar said at the sidelines of an EU summit in Estonia.
"So, if anyone has had a flight cancelled, any airline, in this case Ryanair, needs to provide them with an alternative 
way of getting them where they need to go or refund them in full. I'd absolutely expect the airlines to do that."
He said he counted on Ireland's Commission of Aviation Regulation to make sure passengers' rights are upheld.
Ryanair said it met with the commission on Friday and agreed to implement measures to better inform customers of 
their rights and claims ahead of a deadline by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.
The airline said in a statement that it had emailed all affected customers clarifying their rights to refunds and re-
routing and compensation.

Budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday said it will cut 25 planes, or 6 per cent of its fleet, this winter as it slows its 
planned growth following the recent chaos caused by too many pilots taking annual leave at once.
"We plan to grow more slowly - 4 per cent instead of 9 per cent - this winter by flying fewer of our 400 aircraft 
between November and March 2018," the airline said.
"Ryanair has grown rapidly over 30 years to carry 129 million customers per annum, more than any other EU 
airline," it said.
"However, it suffered a roster failure in September because it has over-allocated months of pilot annual leave 
during the four months from September to December."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, apologized to passengers affected by scores of flight cancellations last 
week.
"From today, there will be no more rostering-related flight cancellations this winter or in summer 2018," O'Leary 
said.
"Slower growth this winter will create lots of spare aircraft and crews, which will allow us to manage the exceptional 
volumes of annual leave we committed to delivering in the nine months to December 2017."

Ahead of a much-anticipated speech on Brexit by a weakened British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, 
differences among Conservative colleagues continue to hamper her efforts to negotiate the terms of leaving the 
European Union, analysts say.
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken pro-EU chief executive of budget airline Ryanair, recently joined a growing number 
of critics who feel Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit negotiations are "going nowhere."
"They are a bit of a shambles, and they need a bit of leadership," O'Leary told Sky News.
Ahead of May's much-anticipated Brexit speech in Florence on Friday, speculation is mounting over whether the 
under-pressure prime minister or a rival inside her Conservative party could try to provide that leadership.
In what many analysts see as the latest sign of division, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - a leadership contender 
before May won the race to replace David Cameron in July 2016 - set out his personal "vision for a bold, thriving 
Britain enabled by Brexit" in The Times on Saturday.
Johnson revived the controversial claim, first used by the Leave campaign he led into last year's Brexit referendum, 
that leaving the European Union could save Britain more than 350 million pounds (455 million dollars) per week to 
be spent on public services.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd accused Johnson of attempting to position himself as a "back-seat driver" of Brexit, 
while David Norgrove, head of the government's statistics office, wrote an open letter complaining that Johnson's 
weekly total of 350 million pounds "confuses gross and net contributions" to the EU and was "a clear misuse of 
official statistics."
Johnson rejected Norgrove's criticism and said he was "looking forward" to May's speech in Florence.
Brexit means Brexit? Conservatives at odds over how to leave EU
"All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit," he wrote on Twitter.
But Colin Talbot, a professor of government at Manchester and Cambridge universities, said it appears that 
Johnson "wants to position himself as Leader of the Hard Brexit Brigade for the leadership battle to come."
The Conservatives are in "almost open civil war," while their main rivals, Labour, are in "suppressed civil war," 
Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said on Monday.
"Boris is Boris," May told reporters travelling with her to Canada on Monday. "This government is driven from the 
front and we are all going to the same destination," she said.
"We are all agreed as a government about the importance of ensuring the right deal for Britain, the right withdrawal 
agreement but also the right deal on a special partnership between the EU and UK for the future."
Despite her recent insistence that she is "not a quitter" and will lead the Conservatives into another general election 
in 2022, Simon Usherwood, a Brexit-focussed political analyst at the University of Surrey, said she remains "a dead 
woman walking."
That has been the view of many observers since May called a disastrous snap election in June.
She surprisingly lost her parliamentary majority in the election, amid a surge in support for left-wing Labour leader 
Jeremy Corbyn, forcing her to rely on backing from 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist 
Party in key votes.
"She's fatally compromised herself with the party, and the party is not a sympathetic organization," Usherwood told 
dpa.
It would take a "pretty astounding turnaround" for May to remain the long-term leader, he said.
"I think at this point it's convenient to keep her in [office], because if things are looking bad she may as well take the 
blame, and then the new person comes in and cleans up and gets a bounce off that," Usherwood said.
Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has promoted a "pro-business" Brexit with strong transitional arrangements to 
protect the economy after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, and Liam Fox, a pro-Brexit trade minister who 
argues that Britain could survive leaving the EU with no deal, wrote a joint article last month that was seen as a 
show of unity by the Conservatives.
Britain will definitely leave the EU customs union and single market but could agree a "time-limited" transition to 
"give business greater certainty," Hammond and Fox wrote in The Telegraph.
But Usherwood said their intervention failed to hide the cracks in party unity.
"You're still getting the different views coming through from individuals," he said.
"They might have patched things over for that [article] but there's still lots that they don't agree on."
Usherwood said he saw "no consensus view in cabinet or in senior levels of the Tory party."
"So it's the same problem that there's been all the way since last June: There's no plan; and even if there were a 
plan, there's nobody who's got a clear ability to make it happen."

The European Commission on Monday warned low-cost airline Ryanair to comply with EU laws on passengers' 
rights after the operator announced that it would cancel more than 2,000 flights until the end of October.
Ryanair said on Friday that it would cancel 40 to 50 flights each day in the coming six weeks to accommodate for a 
backlog of holidays for its crew - noting that the cancellations were meant to "improve [the company's] system-wide 
punctuality."
"It is not for commission to comment on the operational decisions by airlines, but we expect Ryanair to comply with 
the European rules on passengers' rights," said Enrico Brivio, a spokesman for the commission.
Under EU laws passed in 2004, airlines have to notify passengers of cancellations at least two weeks in advance. If 
the cancelled flight is within two weeks, the airline needs to offer to re-route travellers on planes that depart within 
up to two hours from the originally scheduled flights.
If the airline fails to do this, passengers are entitled for compensation.
The European Commission noted that it was up to national authorities to enforce the EU regulation.

Mass protests against Macron labour law but strike impact limited

French President Emmanuel Macron's approach to his flagship labour law reforms appeared to be paying off for the 
moment as a one-day strike called by the hardline CGT union had limited impact on Tuesday.
According to the Interior Ministry, at least 223,000 protesters nevertheless took to the streets to decry what CGT 
head Philippe Martinez described as "a law to give full power to employers."
The CGT said 500,000 people had joined some 200 protests countrywide against measures that Macron, for his 
part, argues are needed to give employers the confidence to create new jobs.
Police in Paris said they fired tear gas at some 300 masked protesters who had thrown projectiles at them. The 
Interior Ministry said 13 arrests were made across the country.
The Eiffel Tower closed its lifts and top story due to strikes, allowing only access by stairs to the first floor, while 
Irish airline Ryanair complained that it had had to cancel 110 flights.
Suburban trains in Paris were also disrupted, but most other transport services operated normally, with the other 
two main union groups largely shunning the CGT's call for a one-day strike.
The leader of France's largest union group, Laurent Berger of the CFDT, told France 2 television that the decrees 
unveiled by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on August 31 were "not a good reform."
But, he argued, the union that engaged with the consultation process led by Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud had 
"succeeded in ensuring that a number of even worse steps were not taken."
The reforms to France's complex and highly protective labour code were a key campaign commitment by Macron, 
who took office in May.
Mass protests against Macron labour law but strike impact limited
He said that businesses needed more flexibility in order to create jobs and reduce an unemployment rate that has 
drifted between 9 and 10.5 per cent since 2010.
The draft decrees announced by Philippe, and due to be formally adopted by the government on September 
22, allow a greater range of working conditions to be agreed at company level rather than sector-wide.
They also allow the smallest companies to negotiate directly with staff or their chosen representatives, rather than 
with unions.
"It's not a labour law, but a law which gives full power to employers," Martinez charged in an interview with 
newspaper Le Parisien on Sunday.
Despite the limited response to the strike call, leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said he was confident Macron 
could be "made to pull back."
"Mr Macron knows that this is a trial of strength and he looked for it. Now it's up to us to rise to the challenge," 
Melenchon said as he joined protests in Marseille.
Melenchon's hard-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), despite holding only 17 seats in the 577-strong 
National Assembly, has managed to win the limelight as Macron's most determined opponent.
It has called its own day of protest for September 23, while the CGT is planning to take to the streets again on 
September 21.
As the Paris march dispersed at the city's southern Place d'Italie, one GCT official argued that they had not 
expected that one day of protest would be enough, but it was a good start.
"There aren't just activists here," Veronique Pascalides of the union's public finance branch told dpa. "It's a very 
good day for the start back after the summer holidays."
The protests were taking place as Macron travelled to the French Caribbean to visit the islands of Saint Martin and 
Saint Barthelemy, devastated last week by Hurricane Irma.
A day ahead of the protests, the president doubled down on controversial comments on Friday describing 
opponents of the reform as "idlers."
The phrase referred to "all those who think that we can do nothing, that we have that luxury," he told reporters.

Air Berlin hits turbulence, cancels 100 flights over sick pilots

Air Berlin passengers faced fresh chaos on Tuesday after the beleaguered German airline cancelled 100 flights due 
to a surge in the number of pilots reporting sick.
The reason for the cancellations is "an extraordinary number of sick reports in the cockpit," said a spokesman for 
Germany's second-biggest airline, which last month filed for insolvency.
Air Berlin has asked passengers to check the status of their flight on the airline's website prior to their arrival at the 
airport after it said it was cancelling 100 of its scheduled 750 flights for Tuesday.
About 200 of the 1,500 pilots due to fly on Tuesday had called in sick, the airline said.
"Today is a day that the existence of Air Berlin is threatened," wrote Air Berlin chief operations officer Oliver Iffert in 
an internal memo seen by dpa.
Calling it a "pilot revolt," the daily Bild reported that the reason for the jump in the number of pilots claiming to be 
sick was a dispute over their possible transition from the insolvent airline to a potential new buyer.
However, the pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, denied the report, saying: "At no point did the VC call for (pilots) to 
report ill."
Air Berlin said it would offer affected passengers the "best alternative travel" options.
The airline announced on Monday that it had slashed a series of international flights as a result of the need to 
reduce its long-haul operations as part of insolvency proceedings.
This included flights to the Caribbean from the western German city of Dusseldorf to September 24.
Air Berlin hits turbulence, cancels 100 flights over sick pilots
The German government was forced last month to provide the airline with a bridging loan of 150 million euros (180 
million dollars) to help it to continue operating.
Potential buyers have until September 15 to lodge offers for the struggling carrier, with Germany's biggest airline 
Lufthansa among bidders seeking to acquire parts of Air Berlin.
German businessman Hans Rudolf Wohrl this week also unveiled a 500-million-euro bid for Air Berlin, which ran up 
a loss last year of about 782 million euros and has debts totalling nearly 1.2 billion euros.
Air Berlin has operated at a loss every year since 2008, except for 2012, when it sold off its frequent flyer 
programme.
In the meantime, budget airline Ryanair stepped up its campaign on Tuesday to take on Lufthansa in its home base 
of Frankfurt with the Irish carrier announcing 34 new flights from Germany's biggest airport from the middle of next 
year.

The European Commission has approved plans by the German government to grant the country's troubled air 
carrier Air Berlin a temporary bridging loan worth 150 million euros (178.76 million dollars).
Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline and an employer of 7,200 people in the country, filed for insolvency in 
August after its main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, withdrew financial support.
The move forced the German government to step in to provide the airline with a temporary credit of 150 million 
euros to help it continue operating.
Last week Michael O'Leary, the head of the Irish budget airline Ryanair, complained that the insolvency process 
was designed to strengthen German airline Lufthansa, who has expressed an interest in buying a large share of 
assets in the bankrupt airline.
The commission said in a statement that Germany "committed to ensure that either the loan will be fully repaid, or 
Germany will submit awinding-down plan for Air Berlin."
"The loan will be paid out in instalments under stringent conditions. In particular, Air Berlin has to demonstrate its 
liquidity needs on a weekly basis and new instalments will only be paid when all existing liquidity has been used," 
according to the statement.
"The Commission found that the measure will help to protect the interests of air passengers and to maintain air 
passenger services."

EU and British officials have held perhaps their most disappointing round of talks so far, ending four days of 
meetings with no sign of progress, recriminations on both sides, and little prospect of a smooth resolution to the 
negotiations.
- William Hague, a former leader of British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party, warned that he 
expected "BIG BUST-UPS" during the months of negotiations until Britain officially leaves the European Union in 
March 2019.
Hague told the BBC that May's negotiating position had been weakened by her poor performance in a snap general 
election in June, when the Conservatives lost their majority in parliament. "We'll end up having to PAY MORE," he 
said. "We'll pay a bigger price for leaving, I think, because of the uncertainties of the election result."
- May was occupied for most of the week with a trade-focused visit to JAPAN, one of several major economies her 
government has targeted for expanded post-Brexit trade and investment. She promised to work to "unblock 
remaining barriers to trade and take steps to build the closest, freest trading relationship between the UK and Japan 
after Brexit."
May told reporters in Japan that she was "NOT A QUITTER" and would lead the Conservatives into another 
election in 2022, despite the pressure that has mounted on her over the June election campaign and criticisms of 
her Brexit policies.
- Michael O'LEARY, the colourful, pro-EU chief executive of budget airline Ryanair, accused May of "swanning 
around Japan drinking tea and sake" instead of handling the Brexit negotiations. "I fail to see what she's doing in 
Japan for three days at the moment, why she's not in Brussels or in Frankfurt or in Paris, which is where these 
negotiations need to take place," O'Leary told Sky News.
THIS WEEK in Brexit: Blame, animosity creep into negotiations
- Meanwhile in Brussels, top negotiators from the EU and Britain met for their third official round of negotiations. But 
as the week progressed the tone among EU officials started sounding increasingly IRRITATED.
- On Monday, before heading into his first meeting the EU's chief negotiator Michel BARNIER said he was 
"concerned." "We must start negotiating seriously," he said pointing to a tight timetable.
- On Tuesday Barnier's boss, Jean-Claude JUNCKER, sounded unimpressed by the position papers put forward by 
the British government in recent weeks. "I did read with the requisite attention all the papers produced by the 
majesty's government and none of those are actually satisfactory," Juncker said.
- At Thursday's closing press conference Barnier did not try very hard to mask his FRUSTRATION with his British 
counterparts. The two sides "did not make any decisive progress," he said.
Barnier warned Britain that, given the STALEMATE on all major issues, discussions on a future trade and economic 
relationship between the EU and Britain were unlikely to go ahead in October as hoped by the British government.
- British Brexit Secretary David DAVIS acknowledged "significant differences to be bridged," especially over a 
financial settlement on what Britain owes the bloc, adding that his government had a duty to its taxpayers to 
interrogate any final financial payment rigorously.

Outspoken Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on Thursday accused British Prime Minister Theresa May of 
"swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake" instead of handling her country's Brexit negotiations in Europe.
"I fail to see what she's doing in Japan for three days at the moment, why she's not in Brussels or in Frankfurt or in 
Paris, which is where these negotiations need to take place," the head of the Ireland-based budget airline told Sky 
News.
"She's just come back from three weeks' holidays in the Swiss Alps," he told the broadcaster.
"Now, everybody is entitled to their holidays, but there's a crisis coming down the road here in the UK economy in 
the next 12 months.
"Brexit is going to be a disaster for the UK economy, and she needs to be over there negotiating, or at least 
removing these roadblocks, not swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake."
O'Leary said he felt the Brexit negotiations, which are continuing in Brussels this week, were "going nowhere."
"They are a bit of a shambles, and they need a bit of leadership," he said.
"From an aviation perspective, the real challenge for us is, because there's no fallback in aviation - we're not 
covered by WTO rules - there is going to be a cessation of flights from March 2019 if she doesn't get her finger out 
and get a deal done in the next 12 months."

Budget airline Ryanair does not plan to bid for any assets belonging to the insolvent German carrier Air Berlin, chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday.
"We will not get involved in this process: it's a stitch-up," O' Leary said in reference to the charge that the insolvency 
process is designed to help strengthen German airline Lufthansa.
Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month after its main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad 
Airways, withdrew funding in response to years of financial losses.
The German government has provided the company with a temporary credit of 150 million euros (176 million 
dollars) to help it continue operating for around three more months.
German flagship carrier Lufthansa has expressed an interest in buying a large share of assets in the bankrupt 
airline. Air Berlin officials are also in talks with two other interested parties.

Formula One legend Niki Lauda is interested in buying back the Niki airline, which he founded in 2003 and which 
has since become a daughter of insolvent German carrier Air Berlin.
"I have written a letter to Air Berlin's insolvency administrator, in which I express my interest in [Niki]," he said in an 
interview that the Austrian tabloid Kronen Zeitung published online on Saturday.
He said he would like to get the chance to look into Niki's accounts.
"Only afterwards I can decide whether it would make sense to take over Niki again," said Lauda.
The former champion racer, who serves as the Mercedes Formula One team's non-executive chairman, warned 
that Lufthansa should not be allowed to take over Air Berlin as well as Niki.
"Politicians completely forget that we need competition. A Lufthansa monopoly would be catastrophic," he said.
Air Berlin is holding takeover talks with Lufthansa, Easyjet and Ryanair, German Economic Minister Brigitte Zypries 
said Saturday in Berlin.
Lauda founded Niki in 2003. One year later, Air Berlin bought a 24-per-cent stake in his company. The German 
carrier completely took over Niki at the end of 2011.

Berlin (dpa) - Chancellor Angela Merkel ruled out taxpayers footing the bill for Air Berlin's rescue and said a 
government-backed 150-million-euro (175.5-million-dollar) bridge loan would head off the threat of the insolvent 
airline's collapse.
Berlin was forced to act because bills had to be paid and tickets honoured, Merkel said.
The risk to taxpayers was "relatively small," Merkel said in a YouTube interview on Wednesday.
"Otherwise," she said, "we would not have been permitted to provide this bridging loan."
A Ministry for Economic Affairs spokeswoman said it believed Air Berlin's talks with Lufthansa and other airlines, 
such as EasyJet, that are seeking to carve it up would be completed quickly.
However, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said its believed there was a "conspiracy" between Berlin and Lufthansa 
over Air Berlin's future.
Ryanair's comments came after the airline filed complaints with both the German and European competition 
authorities over Air Berlin's insolvency, accusing Berlin of violating anti-monopoly laws by paving the way for 
Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin.
European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said Wednesday that the commission and Germany were in 
"constructive contact" about the issue.
Merkel said the Federal Government had "very carefully considered" the decision to provide Air Berlin with the 
temporary loan to keep the carrier flying for three months.
Air Berlin's new chief representative Frank Kebekus told dpa he expected the airline's insolvency process to begin 
on November 1.

Air Berlin is Germany's second-largest airline and employs 7,200 people in the country.

Italy's troubled airline Alitalia on Tuesday got the word out in multiple newspapers and online on Tuesday that it has 
started looking for binding purchase offers from interested buyers.
The airline, which filed for insolvency in May, is soliciting offers from August 7 to September 15, though they would 
be welcome until October 2 at the latest.
Those interested can make an offer either for the entire airline, or only for the air operations or the ground services, 
Alitalia said.
However, the Italian government would give preference to a complete sale offer, according to Ansa news agency.
The deadline for non-binding offers for the airline expired in July.
Low-cost European carrier Ryanair was one of several companies that had expressed an interest and had made a 
non-binding offer for Alitalia's assets, said Ryanair financial head Neil Sorahan in July.
Alitalia has not turned a profit since 2002 and has been on the brink of collapse three times in the past 10 years. 
Privatized in 2008, it has since lost more than 2.5 billion euros (2.95 billion dollars).

Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of the low-cost carrier Ryanair, has described Brexit as the "greatest economic 
suicide note in history."
O'Leary and a number of senior airline and aviation executives spoke Tuesday at a hearing in the EU Parliament on 
the impact Brexit could have on the industry.
O'Leary said that there was "a real prospect," of "no flights between Britain and the EU for days, weeks, months," 
should there be no agreement between the two sides.
Britain is set to leave the EU at the end of March 2019.
Airlines executives want both sides to come to an agreement on aviation as soon as possible, since the industry 
tends to sell tickets one year in advance.
Unlike other sectors aviation is not governed by World Trade Organization rules, which could result in the industry 
having to revert to rules dating back to the 1950s, if Britain and the EU fail to come to an agreement, executives 
warned.
O'Leary said that following meetings with British government officials to discuss the issue, he was under the 
impression that the government had "no clue" and that there was a "delusional attitude in London."
He said that one alternative a British government official had presented, should talks with the EU fail, was an 
agreement with Pakistan.

"They don't have a bulls notion what they are doing," O'Leary said, adding that he wasn't sure how many Britons 
preferred to spend their summer holidays in Karachi rather than in France, Italy or Spain, the current top 
destinations for British travellers.

Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of the low-cost European carrier Ryanair, has described Brexit as the "greatest

having to revert to rules dating back to the 1950s and 1950s, if Britain and the EU fail to come to an agreement, 
executives warned.
Sean Kennedy, who represented Airlines for America, a trade organization of leading carriers, said that without a 
deal, flights between the US and the Britain would come to a halt on day one of Brexit, and warned of "major 
disruption that could wreak havoc on all sides."
He also said that relocating from Britain's Heathrow airport, which is the busiest airport in Europe, was "impossible 
to implement," because of investments worth billions of dollars made by US airlines.

Kennedy added that reverting to old rules would mean fewer flights and fewer frequencies, and that transatlantic 
joint ventures between European and US airlines would have to end.
O'Leary said that following meetings with British government officials to discuss the issue, he was under the 
impression that the government had "no clue" and that there was a "delusional attitude in London."
He also said that he was prepared to cancel all flights to and from Britain in 2019, should there be no firm 
agreement by autumn 2018.
The British airport Stansted is currently the largest base for Ryanair in Europe, with Dublin, Milan, Rome, Barcelona 
and Madrid being the top destinations.
He said that one alternative a British government official had presented, should talks with the EU fail, was an 
agreement with Pakistan.
"They don't have a bulls notion what they are doing," O'Leary said, adding that he wasn't sure how many Britons 
preferred to spend their summer holidays in Karachi rather than in France, Italy or Spain, the current top

Italy minister: Alitalia to be sold to best bidder, Lufthansa welcome
Italy minister: Alitalia to be sold to best bidder, Lufthansa welcome

Alitalia will be sold to the highest bidder and Germany's Lufthansa is welcome to make an offer for it, Transport 
Minister Graziano Delrio said Wednesday, ruling out a government bailout for Italy's near-bankrupt airline.
Alitalia is in trouble since employees rejected in a referendum a rescue plan based on job and wage cuts. 
Shareholders were due to start proceedings for the company to be put under receivership on Thursday, but the 
meeting has been moved to May 2, a spokesman said.
"The company will be sold to the best bidder," Delrio told the La Stampa newspaper. "Some believed that there 
would have been yet another public rescue. I will say it clearly: there will not be one," he added.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, speaking in the southern city of Benevento, confirmed "there is no room for a 
nationalization," but said the government would strive to not break up the company, even though workers' rejection 
of the rescue plan "makes [it] harder."
Asked about the possibility of Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline, taking over Alitalia, Delrio said: "There are no 
obstacles [to it], but it is up to shareholders to take decisions. The ball is in their court."
Italian press reports have repeatedly speculated about a Lufthansa takeover, but the German firm has not 
expressed any interest in public. Alitalia's biggest shareholder is currently United Arab Emirates' Etihad, with a 49-
per-cent stake.
Alitalia's main problem is a loss of business on domestic flights - its former core market - to low-cost airlines like 
Ryanair and high-speed train services, while failing to make significant inroads in more lucrative long-haul routes.
Italy minister: Alitalia to be sold to best bidder, Lufthansa welcome
"Clearly, it had inept managers," Antonio Piras of the Fit-Cisl, one of the unions who signed the failed rescue plan, 
said at a briefing at the Foreign Press Association. "There were many wrong choices over the years, and now we 
are paying the consequences," he noted.
According to Piras, the government is facing a dilemma as both rescuing Alitalia at taxpayer expense and letting it 
go bankrupt with large-scale job losses could cost the ruling Democratic Party votes ahead of elections due by early 
2018.
The trade unionist acknowledged that any possible buyer would be best advised to wait until the company's 
"collapse," to then pick up its customers and assets "spending nothing, or almost nothing. That would be the best 
strategy for them."
In another interview with Il Messaggero newspaper, Industry Minister Carlo Calenda, who brokered negotiations on 
the rejected rescue plan, said the government would only be prepared to offer Alitalia a six-month bridging loan.
Italy's former flag carrier employs about 12,500 people and has not turned a profit since 2002. It was privatized in 
2008, and according to a Mediobanca study, it cost the taxpayer 7.4 billion euros (8 billion dollars) during 1974-
2014 to keep the company afloat.
When Etihad became the leading player in Alitalia in 2014, with Italian banks UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo as 
junior partners, the aim was to return the company to profit by 2017. Last year, it lost an estimated 400 million 
euros.
The plan rejected by workers foresaw a 2-billion-euro recapitalization in return for nearly 1,600 job losses and an 
average 8-per-cent pay cut for the remaining workforce. The package was rejected with 67 per cent voting against.

A strike by ground crew workers at Berlin's two commercial airports has been extended until early Wednesday, the 
Verdi union announced.
The initial strike over pay by around 2,000 workers had been called until early Tuesday.
The walkout began at 4 am (0300 GMT) on Monday and affects both of the German capital's airports - Schoenefeld 
in the south-east and Tegel in the north-west.
It will now last until around 5 am (0400 GMT) on Wednesday.
At Tegel, 465 flights are expected to stay grounded on Monday while at Schoenefeld, 195 flights are due to be 
cancelled, a spokesman for the two airports said.
"We are asking all passengers to check with their airline about the status of their flight before they start their trip," a 
statement on a website for the airports said.
Passengers due to land in Berlin have also been affected.
Airlines are re-routing some flights to the eastern German cities of Dresden and Leipzig, with Easyjet landing at the 
former and Ryanair the latter. Passengers are then being bussed to Berlin, two hours away.
Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller, who was due to make a three-day trip to Moscow, also had his journey interrupted. 
A replacement flight for the mayor was organized from Dresden airport.
An earlier strike on Friday caused hundreds of flight cancellations in Berlin.
Berlin airport strikes extended until early Wednesday
"The Verdi strikes mean our capital Berlin has been completely cut off to air travel for days. Not only are the airports 
being damaged but also the image of Germany," said airport association chief Ralph Beisel.
Trade union Verdi is pushing for a pay increase and better working hours for its members, arguing that their 
workload is increasing given the growing number of passengers at Berlin's ageing airports and a greater focus on 
security.
Strike leader Enrico Ruemker said he was waiting for a new offer from management.
A new combined airport for Berlin near Schoenefeld is expected to open in 2019 after years of delays and 
wrangling.

Final ruling nears on Air Berlin, Ryanair defunct route row

A decade-long dispute between air carriers Ryanair and Air Berlin could come to an end soon - but still too late - 
after a German court on Thursday referred the case to another court for a final decision.
Air Berlin has been fighting for years to get the German city of Luebeck to disclose alleged advantages given to its 
competitor, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, in the hope that Ryanair would then have to pay back the money.
Since Air Berlin originally brought the case against Ryanair years ago, the business environment has changed, with 
the Irish carrier stopping its flights to and from Luebeck.
After the airport - code LBC - declared bankruptcy twice, scheduled passenger flights are no longer conducted at all 
in the northern German city.
Germany's Federal Court of Justice pushed the ruling on to a state court in Kiel on Thursday, following a decision 
made by the European Commission this week on a state aid case from 2007 that is relevant for the Luebeck case.
The commission in Brussels said on Tuesday that certain agreements with Ryanair do not constitute state aid.
The case had been pushed around between German courts and the Court of Justice of the European Union in 
Luxembourg, while the judicial bodies were waiting on the Brussels decision.

Lufthansa's business image at stake in showdown with pilots
By Andrew McCathie, dpa   =
  
The stakes are high for Lufthansa as it continues its long-running
battle with pilots to make the savings it says are necessary to meet
the challenges posed by new airline rivals. Will its image survive
what seem to be never-ending rounds of labour stoppages?
  
Frankfurt (dpa) - Lufthansa's shares faced a turbulent trading
session on Tuesday amid the long-running industrial dispute between
the German airline and its pilots. It's a dangerous game which
threatens damage to the carrier's business image.
  
Germany's biggest airline has been forced to ground more than 1,700
flights scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday after its pilots walked
off the job at midnight Tuesday(2300 GMT Monday) in a pay battle with
the airline that dates back to April 2014.
  
The airline had just endured a days-long labour stoppage last week,
part of the same fight.
  
Lufthansa estimates the cost of the new industrial action at up to 10
million euros (10.6 million dollars) a day, with both sides hardening
their positions as the pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit threatens to
extend the strike beyond Wednesday.
  
"The conflict is only superficially about numbers," said aviation
analyst Heinrich Grossbongardt. "At its core remains [the airline's]
corporate strategy.
  
"The era of the flag-carrier, such as Lufthansa, is coming to an end
and giving way to one of fierce competition with the low-cost
airlines, which, of course, is linked to cuts in social services for
employees," said Grossbongardt.
  
NEWS FEATURE
Lufthansa is battling to cut costs and restructure its operations in
the face of competition from budget rivals such as Ryanair and
EasyJet in Europe and Middle Eastern airlines including Emirates and
Etihad on long-haul routes.
  
Two-and-a-half years ago, Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr promised to
ease the industrial tensions between the airline and its pilots.
  
But the strikes set for Tuesday and Wednesday have thrown the travel
plans of about 180,000 passengers into chaos. Lufthansa have now been
hit by 15 pilot walkouts in the last two years.
  
This has raised questions about what impact the strikes eventually
could have on the airline's customer base and business image.
  
Lufthansa's shares were down by nearly 2 per cent at one stage during
Tuesday trading on the Frankfurt Stock Market, before they bounced
back up 0.93 per cent later in the trading session.
  
The airline reported earlier this year that its adjusted earnings
before interest and tax jumped 55 per cent to a record 1.82 billion
euros in 2015 thanks to low fuel costs.
  
But now, the new round of strikes comes as part of the build-up to
the crucial Christmas travel period, with Lufthansa's 5,400 pilots
demanding a backdated 22-per-cent wage hike over five years until
April 2017.
  
A Munich labour court on Monday rejected Lufthansa's call for an
injunction to stop this week's planned industrial action.
  
That came after a court in Frankfurt last week rejected a similar
request by Lufthansa for an injunction to stop a four-day pilots'
strike, which ended Sunday.
  
Last week's industrial action resulted in the cancellation of 2,700
flights and left 350,000 passengers scrambling to make alternative
travel arrangements.
  
The new industrial action has been sparked by a breakdown in talks
between Lufthansa and the pilots, with Vereinigung Cockpit rejecting
the management's new offer of a 4.4-per-cent salary increase and a
one-time payout equivalent to 1.8 months' salary.
  
"There is still no offer from Lufthansa on which to negotiate for the
remuneration of the pilots, which means that the industrial campaign
has to be continued," Joerg Handwerg of Vereinigung Cockpit's
executive committee said.
  
"Both parties are of the opinion that they are the stronger," Hagen
Lesch from the Institute of the German Economy told dpa.
  
"As long as everyone believes that 'we can beat the others,' we
cannot expect a compromise," Lesch said.
  
Lufthansa's budget airline operations Eurowings and Germanwings, as
well as other carriers in the group - SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Air
Dolomiti und Brussels Airlines - have not been affected by the

DPA FINANCE business Ireland aviation Ryanair  Ryanair reports 7-per-cent rise in half-year profit London   
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, on Monday
said its profit rose 7 per cent to 1.17 billion euros (1.29 billion
dollars) in the first six months of its financial year, despite a
10-per-cent fall in its average fare to 50 euros.
  
The airline said it also cut costs per seat by 10 per cent
year-on-year and opened 73 new routes as it carried some 65
passengers from April to September, up 12 per cent.
  
Ryanair owner Michael O'Leary said the half-yearly results showed "a
creditable performance in difficult market conditions," citing
problems including strikes by air traffic control staff, the effect
of terrorist attacks, and a plunge in the pound since Britain's
Brexit vote in June.
  
Ryanair warned last month that it expects its annual net profit to
fall by up to 125 million euros, mainly due to the fall in the
British currency.

DPA FINANCE Ireland business Ryanair  Ryanair cuts profit forecast amid plunging pound London   
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, on Tuesday
warned that it expects its annual net profit to fall by up to 125
million euros (138 million dollars), mainly due to a plunge in the
pound since Britain's Brexit vote.
  
The airline said it expects net profit of 1.3 billion to 1.35 billion
euros, down 5 per cent from a previous forecast of 1.375 billion to
1.425 billion euros, after the pound lost about 18 per cent of its
value against the dollar since the Brexit referendum on June 23.
  
The fall in the British currency will reduce Ryanair's average fares
by up to 15 per cent in the second half of this year, it said.
  
"While higher load factors, stronger traffic growth and better cost
control will help to ameliorate these weaker revenues, it is prudent
now to adjust full-year guidance, which will rise by approx 7 per
cent rather than our original guidance of 12 per cent," Ryanair owner
Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
  
"This decline is primarily due to the impact of weaker sterling on
our H2 fares," O'Leary said, adding that the new forecast "remains
heavily dependent upon no further weakness in sterling from its
current levels."
  
Budget airline easyJet issued a similar warning earlier this month,
saying its annual profit is likely to suffer a 90-million-pound hit
from the plunging pound and further impact from a fall in passenger
numbers caused by security fears.

DPA FINANCE France labour aviation  Hundreds of flights cancelled amid French air traffic control strike 
Paris   
European airlines say hundreds of flights were delayed
or cancelled on Thursday due to a strike by air traffic controllers
in France.
  
Airlines Easyjet, Ryanair, British Airways and Aer Lingus each
reported numerous flights cancelled due to the strike, which was set
to impact thousands of passengers.
  
More than 300 flights were estimated to be cancelled, as airlines in
Europe reduced their offering by 15 per cent, according to lobby
group Airlines for Europe (A4E).
  
The strike, which is expected to last for 35 hours, is the latest of
several walk-outs this year by French air traffic controllers in
protest at France's controversial labour reforms passed in July in an
effort to jumpstart the country's flagging economy.
  
The labour action drew criticism from A4E lobbyists representing
several airlines affected by the strike.
  
"The demands of increasingly mobile European citizens and businesses
cannot be taken hostage by localized industrial action. It is about
time to minimize the impact of these strike actions," A4E chief
Thomas Reynaert said, also criticizing a lack in measures from
European authorities to prevent such strikes.
  
Europe has already seen several strikes this year by air traffic
controllers in Italy, Belgium, Greece and France, leading to
thousands of cancelled and delayed flights.

Koblenz, Germany   
Raids have been carried out on the rooms of
Ryanair pilots at six German airports as part of a tax and social
insurance investigation, a senior public prosecutor confirmed to dpa
on Wednesday.
  
The Irish budget airline's partner companies are suspected of
indulging in fraud relating to tax and social insurance payments,
said Hans Peter Gandner, senior prosecutor for the city of Koblenz.
  
Several dozen officers carried out the raids on Tuesday at Berlin's
Schoenefeld airport, as well as at the airports in Cologne, Weeze in
North Rhine-Westphalia, Frankfurt-Hahn, Bremen and Baden-Baden.
  
The raids resulted from an investigation dating back years into two
British temporary employment agencies that supply pilots to Ryanair.

London   
Strong passenger growth, fuller planes and low fuel
costs helped Europe's largest low-cost airline, Ryanair, record a
43-per-cent jump in its annual profit, the airline said on Monday.
  
Ryanair promised to cut passenger fares this year after its post-tax
profit soared to 1.24 billion euros (1.39 billion dollars) in the
financial year to March 31, spurred by rises of 18 per cent in
passengers and 16 per cent in revenue.
  
The airline had "delivered significant traffic and profit growth in
all four quarters," Ryanair owner Michael O'Leary said, adding that
it had attracted "millions of new customers."
  
Ryanair said it flights operated at an average of 93 per cent of
capacity and should remain at a similar level this year, while
passenger numbers are expected to grow by another 9 per cent to 116
million in its new financial year.
  
It expects to reduce average fares by about 7 per cent this year and
forecasts a 13-per-cent rise in net profit to between 1.38 billion
and 1.43 billion euros.

DPA POLITICS Britain politics EU Ryanair  Brexit campaigners object to Ryanair «Fly home to vote Remain» 
sale London   
Campaigners for Britain to leave the European Union
complained to police on Friday that Ryanair has broken election law
through its "Fly home to vote Remain" ticket promotion ahead of a
referendum on June 23.
  
The airline, whose owner Michael O'Leary wants Britain to remain in
the EU, offered British citizens one-way flights home for 19.99
pounds (29 dollars) on June 22 and June 23 for bookings made by
midnight Thursday.
  
"By its discount on flights on the day before, and the day of the
referendum, Ryanair is paying the expense, in part, of provision to
voters in order to influence them to vote in the referendum," Dominic
Cummings, campaign director for Vote Leave, said in a letter of
complaint to London's Metropolitan Police.
  
"This appears to be corrupt, since the company is offering discounts
on the commercial rate to customers with the sole aim of ensuring
that they vote and vote to remain in the European Union," Cummings
said.
  
The Metropolitan Police confirmed it had received the complaint and
would examine it to determine whether any offence had been committed.
  
  
Reacting to the complaint, O'Leary extended the promotion for an
extra 24 hours and said it "fully complies with Ryanair's policy of
lowering the cost of air travel" to and from Britain.
  
"The Leave campaign must be getting really desperate if they're
objecting to low-fare air travel for British citizens, so we're
pleased to extend our 'Fly home to vote Remain' sale by another 24
Brexit campaigners object to Ryanair «Fly home to vote Remain» sale
hours," he said in a Ryanair statement.
  
"As the UK's largest airline, Ryanair is absolutely clear that the UK
economy and its growth prospects are stronger as a member of the
European Union and the single market than they are outside the EU,"
O'Leary said.
  
British election law includes an offence of "treating," making it
illegal for someone to "directly or indirectly give or provide any
food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any
voter to vote or refrain from voting."
  
Cummings said Vote Leave believes the Ryanair offer counts as
treating and could also contravene British law on bribery.

DPA x France accident Germany  SIDEBAR   
Germanwings brand name set to slowly disappear   =
  
Berlin (dpa) - Last year's devastating crash of Germanwings flight 4U
9525 resulted in Lufthansa accelerating plans for the Germanwings
brand to be integrated into the airline group's new budget airline,
Eurowings.
  
By October last year, Eurowings had taken over over 55 Germanwings
routes as part of its efforts to transform Eurowings into Europe
third-biggest low-cost carrier.
  
Lufthansa plans to add several more Germanwings routes next month to
Eurowings, which already handles all Germanwings sales.
  
However, Lufthansa's move to create a new budget carrier to compete
with the likes of Britain's Ryanair and Ireland's EasyJet has been
fraught with problems for the Cologne-based airline group.
  
Three years ago, Lufthansa decided to shift the lion's share of its
domestic German flights to Germanwings as it attempted to cut costs
and face up to fierce competition from European discount airlines and
new Middle East-based international carriers.
  
But the switch to Germanwings - where pay rates are lower than other
parts of the Lufthansa group - quickly ran into stiff opposition from
both unions and pilots, triggering a series of damaging strikes by
cabin crew and pilots.
  
Unit labour costs at Eurowings are 30 per cent lower than at the
Lufthansa parent company, the airline said last week.
  
Undeterred by the industrial action, Lufthansa stepped up its plans
for a global discount airline by launching Eurowings' international
operations last year.
  
However, the new global services have been hit by complaints about
long delays in its services.
SIDEBAR
  
Lufthansa hopes to address the problem by expanding the Eurowings
aircraft fleet this year by 10 to 98.
  
Despite the strikes and the March 2015 crash that overshadowed
Lufthansa's 60th anniversary, the airline group last week reported a
record annual profit.
  
Lufthansa said it booked a 55-per-cent surge in adjusted earnings
before interest and taxes jumped to 1.82 billion euros (2 billion
dollars) in 2015 from 1.17 billion euros in 2014, with earnings
boosted by a fall in its aircraft fuel bill and higher passenger
numbers.
  
The Eurowings offshoot contributed to the annual result by posting an
adjusted operating profit of 8 million euros in 2015.

DPA POLITICS Britain politics EU  Business leaders warn Brexit would «deter investment, threaten jobs» 
London   
A group of more than 100 leaders of major businesses
on Tuesday backed Prime Minister David Cameron's campaign for Britain
to remain in the European Union, saying a British exit, or Brexit,
would "deter investment and threaten jobs."
  
"Business needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500
million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs,"
the business leaders said in a letter published in the Times.
  
"We believe that leaving the EU would deter investment, threaten jobs
and put the economy at risk," the letter read.
  
The nearly 200 signatories included top executives from 36 companies
listed on London's FTSE 100 index.
  
Among the companies represented are Airbus UK, British Telecom, BP,
Diageo, EasyJet, Goldman Sachs International, GSK, HSBC, Rio Tinto,
Rolls Royce, Royal Dutch Shell, Ryanair, SABMiller, Siemens
Manufacturing, Standard Chartered, Virgin Media and Vodafone.
  
"The businesses we lead represent every sector and region of the UK,"
they wrote. "Together we employ hundreds of thousands of people
across the country."
  
Cameron's deal with the 27 other EU leaders last week means "Britain
is better off staying in a reformed European Union," they added,
highlighting agreements to reduce bureaucracy, deepen the single
market and pursue international trade deals.
  
The Confederation of British Industry, which represents some 190,000
businesses, has also backed Cameron, praising the EU reform package
as "a major step forward."
Business leaders warn Brexit would «deter investment, threaten jobs»
  
Britain will conduct a referendum on June 23 on whether or not to
remain part of the EU.
  
Eurosceptics inside Cameron's ruling Conservative party have provided
the strongest support for the "leave" campaign.

Passenger volume rose by 20 per cent to 25 million in the three

"We are pleased to report that our low fares policy delivered strong

executive.
  
Bookings were affected by the terrorist attacks in Paris in November,
but the airline "reacted to this softness by running price promotions

Airways have been gaining ground in the European market.
  
The new lobby group, Airlines for Europe (A4E), brings together Air
France-KLM, easyjet, International Airlines Group, Lufthansa Group
and Ryanair, and plans to expand its membership during the coming
months.
  
"For the first time, low-cost and network carriers are creating an
association to support the adoption of a new European aviation
strategy," the heads of the five corporations said in a joint
statement.
  
A4E said it would work with the commission on measures it had
unveiled last month to boost the bloc's aviation sector.
  
The airlines aim to "increase their competitiveness and result in
lower fares and more choice for passengers," by tackling industry
issues such as "large-scale airport monopolies, high charges,
taxation and inefficiencies," the statement said.
  
The group also presented its first study on Wednesday, showing that
airport charges at the EU's 21 largest airports had increased by 80
per cent in the last 10 years, while flight costs dropped 20 per cent
EU-based airlines form new alliance to defend their interests
over the same period.
  
"While the airlines have reduced their fares, EU passengers continue
to be fleeced by excessive airport charges," the group's chief
executives said, urging the bloc to "take action lowering the cost of
the EU's airports by ensuring that monopoly airports are effectively
regulated."

DPA FINANCE transport world aviation  Airline industry set for boom time, says aviation body IATA Geneva   
The aviation industry is booming again thanks to
cheaper oil after years of difficulties, the world airline
association IATA said in Geneva on Thursday.
  
Airlines could expect profits like never before this year and next,
IATA chief executive Tony Tyler announced as he increased his
previous profit forecast for the sector for 2015 to 33 billion
dollars from 29.3 billion dollars.
  
That figure would be almost twice as much as was recorded in 2014.
  
Next year, aviation industry profit is expected to rise to 36.3
billion dollars.
  
"After years of destruction of our capital, we can finally provide a
minimum level of profitability which an investor would expect," Tyler
said.
  
Oil prices have been plunging for the last year and a half.
  
It even looks better for airlines in the previously difficult market
of Europe. Companies such as Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Ryanair
are expected to reach a total profit of 6.9 billion dollars this
year, IATA estimated.
  
That would be 1.1 billion more than last thought while 2016 should
see a 8.6 billion dollar profit.

Lufthansa reaches deal with union representing ground staff
By Sebastian Raabe, dpa   =
  
Berlin (dpa) - Lufthansa reached a deal with a union representing the
airline's ground staff on Saturday, ending one of several pay and
pension disputes that have caused frequent disruptions for travellers
this year.
  
A statement from the Verdi union said that the German air carrier's
33,000 ground personnel would receive a lump sum payment of 2,250
euros (2,400 dollars) if they worked between April and December 2015.
  
The employees will also receive a 2.2 per cent pay rise for each of
the next two years.
  
Changes to employees' retirement benefits have also been a key
sticking point in the negotiations.
  
The union said Lufthansa agreed that recent and future hires will
receive the same pension scheme as long-time employees. However, all
employees must now contribute 1 per cent of their salary to their
plan while the company will put in 5.2 per cent.
  
Faced with increased competition from rivals such as EasyJet and
Ryanair, Lufthansa has been on a drive to reduce its costs by cutting
jobs and benefits, as well as merging its two lost-cost carriers -
Eurowings and Germanwings - under the single Eurowings brand.
  
Lufthansa also faced industrial action from pilots and cabin crew
this year. The seven-day cabin crew walk-off earlier this month was
the longest in the company's history and led to the cancellation of
4,700 flights.

Berlin   
Flight attendants at Lufthansa are to begin their
rolling eight-day strike by withdrawing crews from 2 pm (1300 GMT) at
Frankfurt, the German airline's main hub, their union announced.
  
The union, Ufo, is demanding preservation of retirement benefits that
enable many stewards and pursers to retire from 55. The strike
threatens to pull the airline group back into the red after a quarter
where its earnings rose by half and it forecast a strong full year.
  
Instead of holding an all-out strike, Ufo has adopted a rolling
strategy, announcing its members will not crew any take-offs from
Frankfurt for Friday afternoon and evening, whereas crews will work
as normal at Lufthansa's number-two hub, Munich, through Sunday.
  
Crews were also pulled Friday at a minor field, Dusseldorf, where
Lufthansa operates only a single daily international flight and 18
domestic connections.
  
"All passengers of Lufthansa must assume that their flight might get
cancelled at the last minute," Nicoley Baublies, leader of Ufo,
warned. The short-notice tactic has been adopted by the union to
thwart Lufthansa counter-efforts to organize skeleton services.
  
He added the union was no longer open to talks, and would only call

Lufthansa cancels 290 flights as attendants launch strike
By Jean-Baptiste Piggin, dpa   =
  
Berlin (dpa) - Lufthansa cancelled 290 flights Friday after its
flight attendants announced the first stoppages in a rolling
eight-day strike in defence of their retirement benefits.
  
The airline reserved 2,500 hotel rooms in Frankfurt, the airline's
main hub, to accommodate thousands of incoming passengers at risk of
being stranded in the city.
  
Hundreds of stretcher beds were set up in the airport's transit zone
for those onward-bound travellers, especially from India, who lack
visas to enter Europe.
  
Frankfurt is a principal redistributor point for passenger traffic
between India and North America.

DPA FINANCE Ireland business aviation Ryanair  Ryanair's profits soar after «bumper summer» London   
Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair on Monday
said its profits rose by 37 per cent in the first half of this year
as fuel savings, a strong British pound and poor weather in northern
Europe gave it a "bumper summer."
  
The airline recorded profits of 1.09 billion euros (1.2 billion
dollars) after tax in the six months ending September, said Michael
O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.
  
"We have enjoyed a bumper summer due to a very rare confluence of
favourable events including stronger sterling, adverse weather in
northern Europe, reasonably flat industry capacity and further
savings on our unhedged fuel," O'Leary said in a statement.
  
Ryanair's customer interface programme was also "driving stronger
forward bookings, higher load factors, and accelerating our traffic
growth," he said.
  
O'Leary forecast a rise in passenger numbers to 105 million this
year, up 16 per cent from 90.6 million in the year to March.
  
The Irish-based airline's financial results did not include a gain
from the recent sale of its stake in Aer Lingus.
  
In May, Ryanair announced full-year profits of 867 million euros in
2014, up 66 per cent from the previous financial year.

Cologne, Germany   
German air carrier Eurowings launched its
first flight to Cuba Monday, as the Lufthansa subsidiary expands its
low-cost business plan to include long-haul flights.
  
The new offering comes as Lufthansa is in the process of merging its
two lost-cost carriers - Eurowings and Germanwings - under the single
Eurowings brand.
  
By expanding its no-frills flight offerings well beyond the European
continent, Lufthansa hopes to be able to compete with the likes of
Easyjet and Ryanair.
  
To that end, the company launched the Airbus A330 from the
Cologne-Bonn airport at 11:20 am (1020 GMT), with a destination of
Varadero in Cuba.
  
Eurowings currently flies to 130 European destinations and eight
overseas ones.
  
Lufthansa board member Karl Ulrich Garnadt said that bookings
registered for the company have so far exceeded expectations.

DPA FINANCE Germany business aviation Air Berlin  NEWS FEATURE   
Air Berlin, battling to stay aloft, hopes to keep Etihad happy
By Burkhard Fraune and Bernd Roeder, dpa   =
  
Air Berlin's situation has been precarious for quite some time. Now,
Germany's second-biggest air carrier is worried about its revenues
from - and the intentions of - its most important code-sharing
partner, Etihad.
  
Berlin (dpa) - A row of drab-looking office containers lined up on a
field on the periphery of Berlin's Schoenefeld airport is causing
German air carriers Lufthansa and Air Berlin to worry these days.
  
That's because the containers hid the new fleet of Irish low-budget
carrier Ryanair.
  
Ryanair has now stationed five planes for its winter flight schedule
at Schoenefeld. Work is now going on at the airport to clear and pave
the ground to provide more room for them. A new terminal is also
planned.
  
Berlin's air traffic is expected to grow by a further 6 per cent in
2016, says airport boss Karsten Muehlenfeld - growth to which
Lufthansa and Air Berlin won't be contributing. Instead, it will be
the budget airlines - Easyjet, Norwegian and, above all, Ryanair -
that are moving into Germany's domestic air traffic market.
  
"Air Berlin is still our largest customer," Muehlenfeld stresses. But
other carriers are waiting in the wings to assume that spot.
  
Lufthansa, the top German carrier plans to throw down the gauntlet at
the discount airlines and beef up its low-cost unit, Eurowings, in
Berlin and elsewhere.
  
But this stiffer competition comes at a time when deficit-ridden Air
Berlin is battling for its code-sharing operations with its partner
NEWS FEATURE
Etihad Airways, its UAE state-owned partner that, at 29.2 per cent,
is also Air Berlin's largest shareholder.
  
The two airlines jointly market 65 air routes, with passengers flying
under the same code share. Berlin and Dusseldorf are the gateways for
Etihad passengers heading to Germany, Europe and the United States.
The business means additional revenues of 140 million euros (158
million dollars).
  
Given the airline's total annual revenues of 4.16 billion euros in
2014, this would not appear to be so weighty. But at Air Berlin
headquarters, officials are alarmed.
  
"At the moment we cannot afford such a loss in revenues." Especially
not when Ryanair is lurking nearby, waiting.
  
"At a healthy company one might say it could be balanced out by
cost-savings elsewhere," says Michael Kunert, of the German
shareholders protective lobby group SdK.
  
"But at Air Berlin the situation has been highly dramatic for years
now." A solution is urgently needed in the interest both of
shareholders and employees, he says, adding: "Without the joint
flights, Etihad's interest in Air Berlin could drop off."
  
In fact, Air Berlin is being kept aloft thanks to the financial
infusions from Etihad. Worker representatives at Air Berlin, in a
letter to German Transportation Minister Alexander Dobrindt, voiced
their concern that the Gulf carrier is having "less and less fun"
from its partnership.
  
Matters are up to Dobrindt, since the German civil aviation authority
makes decisions on code-sharing routes based on his instructions.
  
Any decision would have to be, as has been the case up until now,
made under exceptional arrangements, because, by ministry accounts,
29 of the code-sharing routes being applied for do not fall under
Germany's aviation treaty with the United Arab Emirates. These
arrangements cover which airports in Germany that Etihad may serve.
  
In the talks so far, the Arab side had resisted efforts to establish
a legally binding solution, according to ministry sources. The Berlin
government is open to further talks. Economics Minister Sigmar
Gabriel is pushing for a mutually agreeable solution.
  
Last-minute talks took place with the UAE this week on the Etihad
issue.
  
Transport Ministry spokesman Martin Susteck said Friday: "The talks
with the UAE on code-share flights have been unproductive. The
UAE has rejected efforts by the German government to reach a solution
that complies with aviation law."
  
He said the UAE-Germany aviation treaty did not permit all of the
code-share flights sought by Etihad. "The German government remains
open to talks with the UAE," he added.
  
Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel wrote a letter October 16 to
Susteck's boss, Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt, urging "a
compromise" in the dispute, Gabriel's spokeswoman confirmed Friday.
  
Almost forgotten amid all this is that Air Berlin chief executive
NEWS FEATURE
Stefan Pichler has not yet even presented his plans to revamp the
company by 2018. The last word was that he would present them in
early November, but now it appears that the 8,400 employees will have
to wait longer. A company spokesman said the plan is still in the
making.
  
Pichler has already announced aims to reshuffle the company's
management and operations, to orient the airline more strongly
towards its more profitable routes and to strengthen the Berlin and
Dusseldorf hubs. A new low fare has been introduced and more offers
made to business travellers. Further job cuts are possible.
  
It isn't the first attempt to get Air Berlin back up to higher
altitudes. Pichler's predecessors Hartmut Mehdorn and Wolfgang
Prock-Schauer had tried in vain to revamp the airline. Mehdorn did
succeed in gaining Etihad as a partner, thereby gaining some
breathing room.

DPA POLITICS migration Europe Ireland Ryanair  Ryanair to flout EU visa rule to help asylum seekers London   
Budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday said it plans to
flout EU rules by allowing asylum seekers without visas to board
flights from several airports in south-eastern Europe to Belgium,
Italy, France, Spain, Denmark and Germany.
  
A RyanFair campaign from October 12 will ignore a 2001 European
Council directive that penalises airlines for failing to ensure that
passengers have the right to enter their destination country, the
company said.
  
The waiver will apply to non-EU passengers "for whom the EU asylum
right is applicable, and who will produce at the RyanFair desks a
preliminary documentation concerning the chance of obtain asylum in
the countries of destination," it said.
  
The airline plans to open RyanFair desks in Kos, Greece; Podgorica,
Montenegro; Bratislava, Slovakia; and Budapest, Hungary.
  
"We decided to open to refugees our routes from Greece and East
Europe, violating a rule that simply dumps government
responsibilities on the carriers," said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief
marketing officer Kenny Jacobs.
  
"We will proudly cover all the costs of this violation," Jacobs said.
  
"We want to give our small contribution to healing the suffering for
thousands of refugees who were forced to abandon their homes and flee
for their lives."
  
He said Ryanair hoped other airlines will "join us in this campaign,
and force the EU to come together and agree to a plan to tackle the
refugee crisis."

DPA x tourism special travel  Drunk on board - What's the worst case scenario Berlin   
Drinking alcohol on a plane is nothing out of the
ordinary, whether it's a Martini for the fear of flying, a champaign
for the start of the holidays or a cold beer on a short trip.
  
But when is enough enough, and what happens if a passenger drinks too
much?
  
"Everyone reacts differently to alcohol," said Carola Scheffler of
the German Aviation Association (BDL).
  
"Some guests are conspicuous after one beer," said Ali Genc of
Turkish Airlines.
  
There are varying ways to deal with a passenger who has overdone it.
If ground crew at the airport can tell before the flight that someone
is drunk, they are allowed to keep them from boarding, says Robin
Kiely from Ryanair.
  
Once on board, the cabin crew would try to calm down the drunken
guest.
  
Turkish Airlines' Genc said his company would try to offer them
coffee.
  
And if all else fails, the captain has the final call. He could
decide for example if the plane must make an intermediate stop to
drop off the distracting passenger.
  
"That can be expensive," warned travel legal expert Paul Degott, who
said an extra stop could easily cost 100,000 euros (110,500
dollars).
  
And because the passenger violates aviation regulations, the police
would also be waiting for the passenger on the ground.
  
Drunk on board - What's the worst case scenario
But this is usually the rare exception for most airlines. Lufthansa
for example have hardly ever made an intermediate stop because of a
drunk passenger, said Lufthansa spokeswomen Anja Lindenstein.
  
Air Berlin also said things only quite rarely escalate that far.
  
Both Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines said they do not blacklist
drunken passengers for any future flights. But Air Berlin said: "Air
Berlin can deny the transport of passengers for future flights. But
that is also an individual case."

purchase of Irish airline Aer Lingus by International Consolidated
Airline Group (IAG), the owner of British Airways, after it made
concessions to address competition concerns.
  
The European Union's executive had been concerned that the merged
company would face insufficient competition on some routes, and that
Aer Lingus would no longer transport passengers who have connecting
long-haul flights with rival airlines.
  
IAG, which also owns Iberia and low-cost carrier Vueling, agreed to
offer up flight slots to rivals at London's Gatwick airport and
pledged that Aer Lingus would continue to carry connecting
passengers.
  
"By obtaining significant concessions from the airlines, the
commission has ensured that air passengers will continue
to have a choice of airlines at competitive prices," said
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
  
Last month, IAG offered 1.4 billion euros (15.4 billion dollars) to
buy Aer Lingus, after the Irish government approved the move. It
holds a 25-per-cent stake in the former national carrier.
  
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair also has a 30-per-cent stake in Aer
Lingus.

Valletta   
A Maltese court fined an Italian couple a total of
4,600 euros (5,200 dollars) on Thursday for attempting to prevent an
airliner leaving for Italy without them.
  
The court heard that it took Matteo Clementi, 26, and his partner
Enrica Apollonio, 23, almost two hours to get to the airport from
their hotel on Wednesday.
  
After checking in at the airport, they ran to the departure gate but
officials refused to let them through because the gate had been
closed.
  
The couple dashed to the next gate, forced open the emergency door,
and ran down to the airport apron area, signalling to the Ryanair
pilots to let them onto the plane.
  
The plane was still parked but its engines were running and the steps
had been removed. The two were arrested by security staff who had
given.
  
Appealing for a lenient sentence, the defence lawyer noted it was
Apollonio's 23rd birthday, and that she had been looking forward to
celebrating it with her family - but instead had spent it in a cell.
  
The magistrate imposed a mimimum fine of 2,300 euros each.
  
In a statement, Malta International Airport regretted that a holiday
to the Mediterranean island had to end in this way, but reminded
passengers that security was of utmost importance.

Pilots fear for safety as cockpits feel cost-cutting strains
By Christian Ebner, dpa   =
  
As Lufthansa reviews its foray into budget airlines following the
Germanwings Alps crash in March, pilots say cost-cutting at the helm
has clear implications for flight safety.
  
Frankfurt (dpa) - Airline pilots are generally regarded as cool, calm
and collected, and high-flying earners in every sense. But as costs
are cut to the bone, those at the helm are under increasing pressure
to make ends meet.
  
For 18 months Erik Fengler co-piloted a Boeing 737 for Irish budget
carrier Ryanair around Europe. In a good month he says could make
around 5,000 euros (5,600 dollars), much less than his peers in
flagship carriers like Lufthansa - but he only earned if he actually
left the ground, on a so-called zero-hours basis.
  
Often there was no work for him, let alone sick pay or paid
vacation, because officially he was self-employed. Like many pilots
with budget airlines his services were contracted out by an
intermediary firm each time he flew. And it's all perfectly legal,
even though relentless earnings anxieties cannot be good for a
someone flying an aircraft packed with passengers.
  
The low-fare carriers are the key drivers of the "unfair competition
from the inside," believes Dirk Polloczek, president of the European
Cockpit Association (ECA).
  
"Airlines are constantly reinventing models to get cheaper labour,
like hiring self-employed or fake-self-employed pilots, pilots on
temporary work agency contracts, or on zero-hours contracts,"
Polloczek told Flightglobal aviation news website.
  
Meanwhile, in a 2014 survey of 6,633 European pilots conducted by
FEATURE
Ghent University, 16 per cent said they were working under such
non-standard, or atypical, employment terms.
  
This is especially prevalent in budget airlines Ryanair, Norwegian
and Wizz Air, the study indicates. However, the latter Hungarian
operator denied it uses zero-hours contracts, as claimed by
pilots, or the still more controversial pay-to-fly (P2F) arrangement.
  
Under this scheme, qualified but inexperienced pilots actually pay
the employer to get flying time on Asian routes that will look good
on their CVs.
  
The ECA cites the example of the Florida-based EagleJet, which
offers European pilots this opportunity for 87,500 euros.
  
"P2F provides a perverse incentive for a pilot to fly at any cost,"
says ECA secretary general Philip von Schoeppenthau. "Few will admit
it, but when you have paid up to 50,000 euros to fly this plane, you
will think twice before deciding not to fly today because you feel
sick or fatigued."
  
In the future, young pilots are expected to find jobs almost
exclusively with low-fare airlines and will have increasingly
insecure employment terms, according to the association.
  
But governments are still doing nothing about it, the ECA says,
noting the urgent need for unified employment regulations in European
air travel.
  
Norwegian airline is particularly "inventive" in cost-cutting and
social terms and tax optimization, says Robert Hengster, aviation
representative at the Berlin-based Verdi transport workers union.
  
For its planned flights to the United States, the Norwegian company
founded an entity in Ireland which leases Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets
to the parent company and recruits staff in Asia on local terms.
Its Irish licensing is still only temporary and US authorities are
worried about granting the carrier landing rights on such a basis.
  
Precarious airline employment terms pose evident safety risks, warn
industry associations, in part because "self-employed" pilots fearful
for their income can also be less inclined to jeopardize their jobs
by taking a stance on vital safety issues.
  
These include how much fuel should be taken on board on a given
route, and their assessment of reliability of crews that are
assembled shortly before departure.
  
"Decisions are made at airline headquarters and no longer in the
cockpit," says James Phillips, international affairs director of the
German Pilots Association, and a captain himself.
  
As a rule, the pilots should have the last word in matters of safety.
But nearly half of those canvassed in the Ghent University survey say
they cannot deviate from company instructions.
  
Phillips recalls the case of one pilot who was sacked after he wanted
to inspect suspect cargo in his hold. When the freight company
refused to open the crates, he had them unloaded, a conscientious
precaution on his part that cost him his job.
  
Airline employment terms and screening procedures came under intense
FEATURE
scrutiny after Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, a 27-year-old
with a history of depression, is believed to have deliberately
crashed a passenger plane into the French Alps in March, killing 149
people and himself.
  
But cost-cutting in general will inevitably take new forms that are
questionable yet legal. And these may only be exposed as hazardous
after the fact of another tragedy, industry workers fear.
  
The next development in aviation practices, the ECA's Polloczek
warns, could be the flagging, or registering, of individual aircraft
in countries with very low employment standards. This is already
common practice in the shipping industry to reduce operating costs or
sidestep regulations of the ship owner's country.
  
"There are cases where this went very wrong," Polloczek said, citing
the case of the Estonia-flagged Baltic ferry Estonia which sank in
1994, killing 852 people.

Germanwings co-pilot under scrutiny as investigation continues
By dpa correspondents   =
  
Berlin/Paris (dpa) - Investigations into this week's fatal crash of
Germanwings flight 4U9525 focused Friday on the background of the
co-pilot, who has been accused of deliberately downing the plane and
killing all 150 people on board.
  
French and German prosecutors were looking into the background of
Andreas Lubitz, 27, to ascertain why he may have wanted to take his
life and murder 149 others after a voice recording showed that he
purposefully locked the flight commander out of the cockpit and
activated the descent.
  
Parent company Lufthansa's chief executive Carsten Spohr said on
Thursday that Lubitz had interrupted his aviation training in 2009,
but refused to say why. Speculation was rife about the pilot's
psychological state leading up to the incident.
  
Meanwhile, airlines around the world were scrambling to introduce new
rules to increase aviation safety by ensuring that there are always
two crew members present in the cockpit.
  
Emergency codes allow crew members to enter the cockpit when a pilot
becomes incapacitated, but Lubitz is thought to have overridden this
system, which was put in place after the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks in the United States.
  
Norwegian Air Shuttle was one of the first carriers to introduce the
so-called "rule of two," with Britain's Easyjet and Air Canada
following suit. Ryanair said Friday that it had already required two
people to be present in the cockpit at all times.
  
The German Aviation Association (BDL) was set to discuss the new rule
with the country's civil aviation authority on Friday, with German
carriers expected to change its procedures shortly thereafter.
  
1ST LEAD
BDL represents Lufthansa, by far Germany's biggest airline, as well
as Air Berlin, charter airlines Condor and TuiFly and smaller
regional companies.
  
Also on Friday, data from the transponder of the Germanwings plane
confirmed that someone had manually altered the autopilot altitude to
less than 100 feet (30 metres), a flight data organization said.
  
"Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 we can see that the autopilot was
manually changed from 38,000 feet to 100 feet," said the post by
FlightRadar24, which tracks aviation traffic, late Thursday.
  
"Nine seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with
the 'open descent' autopilot setting," it said.
  
Flight 4U9525 left Barcelona around 10 am (0900 GMT) on Tuesday, and
disappeared from radar around an hour later before crashing into a
mountainside 165 kilometres north-east of the southern French city of
Marseille.
  
The FlightRadar24 data was collected from the transponder's automated
responses to interrogating radar requests.
  
There were 150 people on the plane, including some 75 Germans, 50
Spaniards, and over a dozen other nationalities, records show.

Lufthansa in crisis amid restructuring and cost-cutting efforts
By Christian Ebner and Max-Morten Borgmann, dpa   =
  
Lufthansa is in crisis. Struggling to cut cost amod efforts to match
its rivals' rock-bottom costs, the airline is facing tough questions
over the future direction of its business.
  
Frankfurt (dpa) - German airline Lufthansa has long been struggling
to match its rivals' rock-bottom costs. Chief executive Carsten
Spohr, now ten months on the job, is fighting on several fronts and
trying to find new areas to expand the business.
  
Now, added to the protracted dispute with pilots, he faces the ire of
shareholders who, if the Lufthansa management has its way, will have
to go without any dividends from 2014.
  
Disastrous news of a loss of 723 million euros (821 million dollars)
came just a day after a employees' meeting in Frankfurt, one that had
been meant to launch the company into a new era.
  
Spohr and fellow executive board member Karl Ulrich Garnadt, seeking
to reassure employees, called for an "alliance of growth and
employment" but did not go into any specifics.
  
Their simple message was this: If we succeed in reducing costs, then
growth will once again be possible in the core company, Lufthansa
Passage. By 2020, the executives said, the fleet could be expanded by
27 planes and 1,800 crew members.
  
Though no concrete cost-cutting measures were recommended, some
employees came away hopeful. Nicoley Baublies, head of Ufo, the union
for cabin crew, said the executives had cleared up many nasty rumours
about job cuts ahead.
  
Less sanguine about the prospects is the pilots union Vereinigung
NEWS FEATURE
Cockpit (VC). "I didn't hear anything new," one VC spokesman said
after the meeting. A long-running wage dispute between Lufthansa and
its pilots remains resolved.
  
And, things could become problematic with the more amenable Ufo union
members if pensions and transitional benefits of thousands of cabin
personnel are slashed. Negotiations on the issues have already
collapsed once.
  
Afterwards, the union and Luftansa were not even able to agree on a
mediator and instead named two polar-opposite politicians - Herta
Dauebler-Gmelin of the centre-left Social Democrats and Friedrich
Merz of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union - as
co-mediators.
  
The pilots are especially against the moves made by Spohr to boost
discount offers in order to compete against cheaper competitors such
as Ryanair and EasyJet.
  
For example, under the aegis of the discount operator "Eurowings,"
crews of the German-Turkish carrier SunExpress are to fly routes
around the world - at wages that are 30 to 40 per cent below those of
established Lufthansa crews.
  
SunExpress chief Paul Schwaiger says that recruiting personnel is no
problem. "There are enough pilots in Europe," he says.
  
But pilots are not the only ones to doubt whether any money can be
made with new services on long-haul flights. They point out the
example of British Airways that has long since quit the competitive
short- and medium-range routes and now is lucratively connecting
London-Heathrow with the rest of the world.
  
Like its even more greatly suffering competitor Air France/KLM,
Lufthansa must continue to save. Last year the company outsourced to
IBM some of its computer centres. In doing so, it incurred additional
costs of 200 million euros.
  
Other factors in Lufthansa's meagre business figures have been
erroneous speculation in insuring its kerosene prices and rising
pension costs.
  
The savings efforts are set to continue. The business publication
Manager Magazin reported that corporate consultant McKinsey has
presented Lufthansa's board with a plan for a comprehensive
reorganisation of its management.
  
The report said that while Lufthansa until now had strongly pushed
the autonomy of its subsidiaries Swiss and AUA, under the McKinsey
proposals management is to be clearly more centralized.

Irish budget carrier Ryanair revised upward its
full-year profit forecast Monday, citing lower fuel costs and higher
passenger numbers.
  
This is the fourth time the no-frills airline has upped its profit
outlook for the fiscal year, which ends in March.
  
Ryanair, which this year marks the 30th anniversary of its founding,
now expects to earn 840 million euros to 850 million euros (951
million dollars to 962 million dollars) in annual profit. In May, it
had estimated profit at 580 million to 620 million euros.
  
The fall in oil prices is expected to contribute to a 5-per-cent
reduction in costs, Ryanair said.
  
Chief executive Michael O'Leary attributed the results to "expanded
business schedules, coupled with our substantial fare and cost
advantage over competitor airlines."
  
Last month, Ryanair announced that annual passenger numbers rose to
86.4 million in 2014, an increase of 6 per cent on 2013.

Irish airline Aer Lingus warms to IAG takeover offer
By Sid Astbury, dpa   =
  
London (dpa) - Irish takeover target Aer Lingus on Tuesday backed an
improved cash offer from British Airways-owner International Airlines
Group (IAG) that values the airline at 1.3 billion euros (1.46
billion dollars).
  
The Aer Lingus board said in a statement that it "would be willing to

AIG, which also owns Iberia, previously had offers of 2.30 euros and
2.40 euros rejected.
  
Aer Lingus, in a statement to the London stock exchange, noted IAG's
promise that, like Iberia, the Irish carrier would be operated as a
"separate business with its own brand, management and operations."
  
The offer is to be discussed at the Irish cabinet's weekly meeting in
Dublin later in the day.
  
The Irish government has a 25.1-per-cent stake in Aer Lingus, and the
budget operator Ryanair, a previous Aer Lingus suitor, is a
29.8-per-cent stakeholder.
  
Deputy Prime Minister Joan Burton warned at the weekend that
maintaining flight frequencies to Europe and the United States was a
big consideration when assessing the offer.
  
"What we'll want to do as a government ... is to protect these slots
and the connections of direct flights in and out of Ireland," she
said.
  
IAG boss Willie Walsh, a former Aer Lingus chief, covets the
airline's 23 take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport,
1ST LEAD
where it is the fourth-largest operator after British Airways,
Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic.
  
He wants to see Aer Lingus join British Airways and Iberia as a
member of the oneworld airline alliance.
  
Aer Lingus employs 3,900 people, mostly in Dublin.

Fighting for passengers, seat space: what lies ahead for air travel
By Albert Otti, dpa   =
  
Falling oil prices and fierce competition between low-cost and
traditional airlines bode well for air travellers next year. But
there are some trends that will not please passengers.
  
Vienna (dpa) - Some holiday season travellers might dream of a white
Christmas, but many people crowding the world's airports this month
are more likely to dream of lower airfares, more legroom and
upgrades.
  
Here is a look at what might become reality and what will remain a
fantasy for airline customers in 2015 and beyond.
  
OIL PRICES AND TICKET PRICES
  
Prices for crude oil have dropped dramatically this year. This bodes
well for airlines, which expect to pay less for jet fuel, and air
travellers, who hope that this will translate into lower airfares.
  
Average prices for return flights are expected to fall by 5.2 per
cent next year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA)
predicts.
  
"However, the link between prices and the oil price is not
straightforward on all routes," says Rene Steinhaus, an airline
expert at Berlin-based consultancy AT Kearney.
  
Competition, supply and demand are also important factors.
  
Ticket prices could remain flat or even rise slightly in several
Asian markets with slowing growth in the airline industry, such as
Hong Kong, or falling demand for low-cost carriers, such as
Singapore, US online travel agent Expedia predicts.
  
THE BLURRING LINE BETWEEN LOW-COST AND TRADITIONAL CARRIERS
FEATURE
  
Traditional airlines still want to set themselves apart from their
perky low-cost rivals, but the two are becoming more and more alike,
industry analysts say.
  
For example, US carrier Delta is offering five fare segments starting
in March, from the luxury Delta One down to Basic Economy, a class in
which travellers are not allowed to change tickets or reserve seats.
  
"It's structured in a way that virtually guarantees a segment of
people who buy it are going to be really pissed off," wrote US travel
advisor Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flier blog.
  
Not all online booking sites are transparent about what it means to
be a Basic Economy traveller, he explained.
  
But the convergence between low-cost and so-called legacy carriers
can also have positive effects.
  
Budget airlines, such as Ireland's Ryanair, are moving away from
rural, secondary airports and are increasingly trying to fly to the
main hubs to woo business passengers.
  
Business clients, as well as price-conscious holiday travellers, both
stand to profit as the entire industry is fighting over them.
  
"In the short run, ticket prices will fall because competition
increases," Steinhaus said.
  
LONG-DISTANCE AT LOW COST
  
Over the years, several budget airlines have tried and failed to
enter the long-distance business. But some carriers are once again
making attempts to gain a foothold in this market.
  
Norwegian Air Shuttle is already offering trans-Atlantic flights, and
Lufthansa's German budget subsidiary Eurowings plans to start
services to Florida, the Indian Ocean and southern Africa in late
2015.
  
Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia X has dropped intercontinental
flights, but it nurtured hopes of resuming them when it ordered 55
Airbus jets in December.
  
"We are well on our way to realizing the dream of becoming the
one-stop center, offering the widest network in Asia and beyond,"
AirAsia X chairman Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz has said.
  
DREAMING OF LEGROOM
  
Every positive trend has an evil twin. In the case of long-distance
budget flights, this means that more seats are crammed into aircraft
to keep operating costs low.
  
"Never mind the cost efficiencies. Will our bums fit in them?,"
Australian online news site Crikey asked recently about AirAsia X's
future Airbus seats.
  
Airlines might be using new, slimmer seats that take less space, but
more seats do not necessarily mean less legroom. Indeed, it means
that air travel will not get more comfortable for the masses, unless
they opt for first class.
FEATURE
  
Those who cannot afford such luxuries have looked to gadgets to ease
their in-flight suffering.
  
The Knee Defender was designed to prevent the seat in front from
reclining, but it has led to a fight between passengers and an
unscheduled landing this year in the United States, and several
US airlines ban it.
  
Then there is the Soarigami, a more benign device designed to
separate armrests and prevent scuffles over elbow space. Pre-ordering
for the foldable product starts in early 2015.

DPA x Germany labour transport  Pilots' strike results in Lufthansa cancelling half long-haul flights 
Frankfurt   
Lufthansa pilots launched on Thursday their second
strike this week over an early retirement scheme bringing to a halt
about half of the German airline's scheduled long-haul flights.
  
  
The strike, from 0200 until 2259 GMT, came after the pilots' union
Cockpit rejected on Wednesday an offer from Lufthansa for mediation.
  
  
The industrial action resulted in Lufthansa cancelling 37 long-haul
flights and six cargo flights just as the key Christmas travel period
was getting underway.
  
The pilots' action came one day after Lufthansa announced plans to
boost its budget airline operations in the face of tough competition
from low-cost carriers, including Ryanair and easyJet and emerging
Middle East-based airlines such as Etihad, Emirates  and Qatar.
  
Thursday's strike, which is the pilots' 10th this year, follows
Lufthansa's plans to raise the pilots' retirement age from 55 to 60.
  
  
On-and-off labour stoppages since April have forced Lufthansa and its
subsidiary airlines to cancel 6,000 flights.
  
  
Lufthansa was forced to cancel on Monday and Tuesday about 1350 or
half its scheduled flights after the pilots walked off the job.

Air France pilots backed the expansion of the airline's
low-cost subsidiary despite staging their longest strike over the
development of Transavia in September, their union said Wednesday.
  
More than four-fifths of the pilots took part in the vote, and of
those, 53 per cent voted in favour of an expansion, the largest of
Air France's pilots unions, SNPL, said.
  
The pilots walked off their jobs for two weeks in September and cost
Air France-KLM about 500 million euros (622 million dollars). The
strike ended under pressure from the government without an agreement
on a new pay deal for Transavia pilots.
  
Air France said it needs to reduce crew costs to make Transavia into
a competitor with the likes of Ryanair and Easyjet.
  
The proposal before the pilots this week included whether to expand
Transavia's fleet from 14 to 40 planes.

DPA FINANCE business aviation EU  EU should probe legality of Irish flight tax, court rules Luxembourg   
The European Commission should have investigated
whether an Irish tax on air travel is in breach of EU law, a court
ruled Tuesday, following a complaint by low-cost carrier Ryanair.
  
The European Union's executive is responsible for ensuring that
member states don't hamper with free market competition through
measures that benefit certain companies, but not others.
  
In 2009, Ireland introduced an air travel tax, but exempted
passengers travelling on to another destination.
  
Ryanair complained at the time that the system favoured Irish
carriers Aer Lingus and Aer Arann, as they had comparatively more
transit and transfer passengers than the low-cost airline.
  
It also argued that the flat-rate fee - 3 euros (3.84 dollars) per
departure - made up a higher proportion of the ticket price for
low-cost carriers than for traditional airlines.
  
But the commission dismissed the concerns in 2011, arguing that the
tax was not selective. Ryanair disagreed, and brought the issue to
the EU's General Court.
  
The Luxembourg-based judges partially backed Ryanair's complaint, and
said the commission should have launched a formal investigation into
the Irish tax.
  
They argued that the commission's examination had been "incomplete
and insufficient," pointing to "inconsistencies" between its decision
and a letter sent by the Irish authorities about the tax exemption.
  
The commission's preliminary inquiry into the measure also took
longer than normal, indicating that it had "encountered serious
EU should probe legality of Irish flight tax, court rules
difficulties" that would have merited a full investigation, the court
found.
  
The decision can be appealed before the European Court of Justice,
the EU's top court.
