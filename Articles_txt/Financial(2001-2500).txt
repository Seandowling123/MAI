 Galentine's Day is a new celebration that is growing in popularity, especially amongst millennials who are 
constantly on the lookout for ways to commemorate it. 
Whilst many individuals will be aware of Valentine's Day as February 14th, the day to celebrate love, they will not 
have heard of Galentine's Day which is celebrated the day prior. 
Galentine's Day is an unofficial holiday to celebrate female friendships and honour a different type of love that you 
may have in your life, like the one that exists between friends. 
Valentine's day doesn't have to just be about romantic love it can be a day to celebrate all forms of love and 
Galentine's Day aims to do just that whether it's between friends or family. 
DESIblitz has put together a list of 10 of the best ways you can celebrate Galentine's Day this February 13th. 
Bottomless Brunch 
Going out for bottomless brunch has rapidly grown in popularity whereby groups are able to go out for a meal and 
get an unlimited number of drinks for the duration of their meal at a selected price. 
The concept has been a hit, especially with larger groups of people who are looking for a fun way to celebrate 
occasions whilst eating and drinking. 
There are many chain restaurants across the UK that now offer a bottomless brunch service. 
One of the most popular spots is Turtle Bay. Related Reads 
The Caribbean restaurant has been a major go-to brunch place for many as it is priced affordably at 31.50pp and 
offers two hours of unlimited cocktails, mocktails, red stripe and prosecco. 
Other popular bottomless brunch spots across the UK include Slug and Lettuce, Banyan and Manahatta. 
So, be sure to check them out this Galentine's Day. 
Pamper Night 
What better way to celebrate the love and respect in female friendships than a pamper night filled with fun, 
relaxation, and self-care? 
Spend the evening pampering yourself and your friends with a spa-inspired day filled with facemasks, mani-pedis, 
and massages. 
If you're struggling with where to get pamper evening essentials for you and the girls then be sure to check out the 
pamper and spa boxes sold by Beauty in the Box[1], Cult Beauty[2] and Sanctuary Spa[3]. 
10 Best Things to do for Galentine's Day
A pamper night will definitely boost spirits and create an evening of relaxation for you and the girls. 
Girls Getaway 
Galentine's Day is a perfect excuse to plan a girl's trip either abroad or even a staycation in a different part of the 
country. 
There are so many airlines like RyanAir and EasyJet that offer affordable flights across the world, especially in 
February as it is not a peak travel time. 
If going abroad isn't practical, but you would still like a weekend away, try booking a staycation in the country. 
The UK boasts beautiful cities like Edinburgh and York that have gorgeous sights, restaurants, and activities. 
Websites such as Booking.com, Loveholidays, and Lastminute.com, all offer last-second escapes within the country 
and outside of it. 
So, get planning your girl's getaway this Galentine's Day. 
Afternoon Tea 
If a more sophisticated outing is on your mind this Galentine's Day then plan afternoon tea for you and the girls. 
There are plenty of cafes and restaurants that offer an amazing afternoon tea service in the UK. 
For example, there is Betty's Afternoon Tea[4] in various locations across Yorkshire, Fortnum & Mason in London, 
and Malmaison in Birmingham. 
You could also plan your own afternoon tea and set it up from the comfort of your own home complete with finger 
sandwiches, scones, teacakes, and of course a big Victoria sponge. 
Movie Night 
A relaxing movie marathon with your best pals couldn't be a better way to enjoy and celebrate love in friendships. 
Many Galentine's films celebrate female friendships that you could choose from. 
Pick from Girls Trip, Thelma and Louise, 50 first dates, and Breakfast at Tiffany's, to name but a few. 
Alternatively, you could blitz through a box set and spend the day enjoying your favourite binge-worthy shows and 
films like Harry Potter or Friends. 
So warm up the popcorn and get your favourite movie snacks to celebrate Galentine's Day. 
Order a Takeaway 
You can't go wrong with a takeaway and a good movie so why not order a big takeaway for you and the girls to 
share this Galentine's Day? 
The cuisine options are endless when it comes to takeaways, and you can choose from Indian, Chinese, Mexican, 
Italian, and much more. 
There are enough varieties of food to please everyone. 
With food delivery apps like Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats, ordering food for large groups has never been 
easier. 
A takeaway and a chilled evening with girls is the perfect option for those wanting a lowkey Galentine's on a budget. 
Exchange Gifts 
Most people buy gifts for their significant other on Valentine's Day, so why not buy a gift for your friends too? 
Exchanging gifts doesn't have to be limited to Christmas or for romantic couples on Valentine's. 
Gifts can also be exchanged between friends to honour platonic love as well. 
There are plenty of gifts you can get a friend this Galentine's including a spa treatment, flowers, chocolates or even 
a nice bottle of wine. 
If you're feeling extra lovey this Galentine's Day, why not get your best gal pals Galentine's Day cards too? 
You can customise your own special message to your girlfriends using Moonpig or Funky Pigeon to show your 
appreciation for them. 
Pottery Experience

Pottery is an artistic and stimulating outlet that has become extremely popular in recent years. 
New businesses have cropped up across the UK offering pottery-making sessions and classes for anyone and

are all businesses across the UK that offer package pottery experiences for groups of people.

Parents Leave Baby at Airport Check-In Counter To Catch Their Flight

In what may have been an unprecedented turn of events, a couple abandoned their baby at an airport reception 
desk in Tel Aviv on Tuesday while they ran to catch their plane.
The passengers, who were not identified (but were evidently from Belgium), were running so late for their scheduled 
Ryanair flight from Ben-Gurion International Airport to Brussels that boarding had already closed by the time they 
arrived at check-in.
While they were already too tardy to check in for their flight, the pair caused a commotion after being told they 
needed to purchase a plane fare for the child and then ditched their infant at the desk.
According to Israel's N12 News, the parents decided to leave the infant in its carrier on the counter while they made 
a mad dash for security checkpoints and the terminal beyond in hopes of making it onboard.
As one might expect, they were not admitted onto the aircraft. Instead, they wound up being chased down by 
Airport Security officers after (presumably, panicked) check-in agents called for assistance.
"All the employees were shocked, we have never encountered anything like this. We couldn't believe what we were 
seeing," a Ryanair manager told local reporters.
The Israeli Airport Authority told the outlet, "The couple left the infant seat with the baby and ran toward the security 
checks at Terminal 1 in an attempt to reach the boarding gate for the flight."
The matter was then referred to local law enforcement, a Ryanair spokeswoman told CNN in an email. "These 
passengers traveling from Tel Aviv to Brussels (31 Jan) presented at check-in without a booking for their infant. 
They then proceeded to security leaving the infant behind at check-in," she explained. "The check-in agent at Ben 
Gurion Airport contacted Airport Security, who retrieved these passengers, and this is now a matter for local police."
N12 News reported that the couple was taken aside for questioning after being reunited with their offspring. But 
perhaps the incident was ultimately chalked up to absentmindedness on the parents' part, since a spokesman for 
Israel Police told CNN that the trouble seemed to have been settled by the time police officers got to the scene. 
"The baby was with the parents and there's no further investigation," he said.

 Two Belgian Twatwaffles were told in an Israeli airport that their baby required a ticket to fly. The ticket counter was 
closed, so they left the baby in the stroller and took off for the plane. 
Newser-[1] 
Airport staff seea lot of[2]weird stuff[3]. But staff at Israel's main airport in Tel Aviv say 'we didn't believe what we 
were seeing' Tuesday as a couple—who'd purchased two tickets for a flight out of the country—ran off to catch their 
flight, leaving their infant son behind. Outlets suggest this wasn't an accident. The parents, who hold Belgian 
passports, had arrived late to the airport and only then learned they needed to buy a third seat for their child, 
reports theIndependent[4]. According to theTimes of Israel[5], they were unable to purchase a third ticket to 
Brussels as the check-in counter at Ben Gurion Airport had already closed. 
They 'then sprinted off toward security, leaving the infant behind in a baby carrier,' per theTimes. A short video 
shared by theNew York Post[6]shows someone pulling down a cover on the carrier to reveal the infant boy. A voice, 
speaking in Hebrew, reportedly says, 'She left him here, I swear!' 'All the workers were in shock,' said a Ryanair 
employee at the airport, per theTimes. 'We have never seen anything like that.' The couple was nabbed by airport 
security and didn't make their flight, perIsrael Today[7].

Feb 03, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence 
are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both. 
The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks 
#1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, 
more confident investor. 
Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. 
With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better 
chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading 
under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, 
Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted 
stocks. 
Growth Score 
Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength 
of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, 
and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings 
outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint 
Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is a Top Momentum Stock for the Long-Term
good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage 
change in earnings estimates. 
VGM Score 
What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it 
one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined 
weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and 
most promising momentum. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier. 
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 
1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 
companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day. 
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are 
right for you and your investing journey. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to 
pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 
(Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible. 
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate 
revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy. 
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a 
downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B. 
Momentum investors should take note of this Transportation stock. RYAAY has a Momentum Style Score of B, and 
shares are up 12.5% over the past four weeks. 
Three analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023, while the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.59 to $5.88 per share. RYAAY also boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.5%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

Feb 03, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shares of Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] are performing well following the release of its third-quarter 
fiscal 2023 earnings report on Jan 30. Shares have gained 3.6% since then. The upside was due to the earnings 
beat reported by RYAAY. 
Lets delve deep into the earnings report and the guidance. 
Ryanair's third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022) earnings of 95 cents per share (excluding 4 cents from 
non-recurring items) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents. Revenues of $2,630.9 million missed the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,606.2 million. Revenues surged 40.4% year over year, driven by upbeat 
passenger volumes. 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario in the Christmas/New Year period, RYAAY's profit after tax was €211 
million in third-quarter fiscal 2023 against a net loss of €96 million incurred a year ago. In the same time period, 
operating costs climbed 36% to €2.15 billion, driven by a 52% increase in fuel expenses to €0.90 billion. 
Average fares in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 were up 14% from the corresponding pre-COVID level. Net debt at 
RYAAY declined to €0.96 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Ryanair maintained its traffic forecast for fiscal 2023 of 168 million. Riding on a strong fiscal third quarter, profit after 
tax for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be in the €1.325 billion-€1.425 billion range. 
We remind investors that the current forecast was announced early last month owing to the surge in traffic 
witnessed during the peak Christmas/New Year period. The earlier guidance for profit after tax in fiscal 2023 was in 
the €1 billion-€1.20 billion band. 
Continuing the traffic strength in January, Ryanair flew 11.8 million passengers in the month, higher than the 7 
million flown a year-ago. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in January 2023 was 91%, compared with 
79% a year-ago. Zacks Rank Ryanair currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list 
of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[2] 
Below we present some stocks from the Zacks Airline [3]industry, that have reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings 
beat. 
Why Ryanair (RYAAY) Stock Is Up 3.6% Since Q3 Earnings Release
Delta Air Lines' DAL[4] fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.48 per 
share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 per share. DAL reported earnings of 22 cents per share a year 
ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. 
Delta reported revenues of $13,435 million, which also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,030.3 
million. Driven by the high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 41.87% on a year-over-year 
basis. Managementexpectsfirst-quarter 2023 earnings per share in the band of 15-40 cents. 
Alaska Air Group ALK[5] reported mixed fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Quarterly earnings of 92 cents per share beat the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. The bottom line surged more than 100% year over year. 
Reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand, consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 14% to 
12.85 billion. Consolidated load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased 6.1 percentage points to 
85.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Economic fuel price per gallon climbed 57.1% to $3.55.

Why the demise of Flybe is not a surprise

The outlook for aviation industry demand in 2023 is positive, but there may be increased consolidation, and failures 
of some weaker players. In particular, regional airlines may be at greater risk, and so it has turned out, with Flybe 
once again in administration.
It is worth remembering that Flybe was a struggling airline well before the pandemic, finding itself increasingly 
squeezed by low-cost airlines (and no thanks to a ridiculous double taxation on UK domestic flights, which has now 
been changed). In the run-up to the pandemic Flybe was trying, without success, to find a buyer.
The airline was eventually rescued in 2019 by a consortium including Virgin Atlantic, Stobart and Cyrus Capital. The 
timing was unfortunate, and Flybe was one of the first casualties of the Covid-19 pandemic, going into 
administration in March 2020 when lockdowns came into force in the UK and around the world.
The lowest cost wins
Cyrus Capital bought the business and assets, but in reality, the only real value was the 12 Heathrow slot pairs. 
Given that these slots were originally owned by British Airways but given up to Flybe as part of a remedy following 
the BMI takeover, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) would not allow Cyrus Capital to have the slots without 
being a viable operation.
Cyrus found itself with no choice but to restart Flybe's operations, but in an even worse strategic position than 
before the pandemic. IBA's analysis shows that on the routes the airline operated, Flybe's share of seats was only 
10%, and it found itself competing with larger aircraft with a lower cost per seat. Lowest cost almost always wins on 
short-haul, and therefore it was inevitable that Flybe would struggle.
Will anyone buy Flybe?
In theory, Flybe's slots will revert to British Airways now, and with its aircraft fleet leased, it is questionable whether 
there is any value that can be salvaged from the airline. Yes, in theory an investor could buy the business and try 
again, but is anyone crazy enough to try this? Well, this is the airline industry, so we wouldn't totally rule it out. 
Though this is unlikely in our view, easyJet would love to take on British Airways at Heathrow, but 12 slot pairs are 
not enough to create a viable operation.
Why the demise of Flybe is not a surprise
More consolidation is to come
In summary, IBA believes that in 2023, the divide between the strong and the weak will get even wider. We saw 
Ryanair report record Q3 profits, and other Tier 1 players are guiding very positively. So, we continue to believe 
there will be an acceleration in consolidation in 2023, which is very positive for pricing from the airline's perspective 
- if not from the consumer's.

 The first reaction was shock, said Sophie Zeldin-O'Neill in The Guardian[1]. Some of those due to fly with Flybe, 
the UK regional airline that collapsed for the second time in three years last weekend, had booked tickets just hours 
before the news came through. 'I got an email asking me to check in, and ten minutes later they had gone into 
administration,' said one passenger. Hundreds of others were left 'stranded' and out-of-pocket at their outbound 
destination because the company wasn't part of the Atol protection scheme.  
Doubtless some 300 staff, now in limbo as administrators comb through the books, will sympathise with their plight, 
said Jon Yeomans in The Sunday Times[2]. Yet it turns out that the writing was already on the wall. The Belfast- 
and Birmingham-based carrier, which was losing 5m a month, had begun looking for a buyer in October - just six 
months after it relaunched. The owner, the US hedge fund Cyrus Capital, is now listed as a creditor, along with 
several leasing firms. Ryanair has reportedly offered a lifeline to Flybe staff by setting up a fast-track recruitment 
process. 
Flybe's latest nosedive is a blow to 'regional connectivity', and thus the Government's levelling-up agenda, said Ben 
Marlow in The Daily Telegraph[3]. But the troubles of smaller European carriers - Norway's Flyr is the latest to face 
'permanent grounding' - are a boon to larger competitors such as easyJet and Ryanair. Reduced competition is 
rarely good for any market. But in UK aviation, where ticket prices rose by an eye-popping 44.1% last year, the 
growing 'stranglehold' is particularly grim. For now, passengers seem willing to put up with it: Ryanair is on course 
for record profits this year. 'At some point, though, a backlash seems inevitable.'

 A couple traveling with a ticketless child from Israel to Belgium left the baby behind at the airport's check-in counter 
before hurrying off to try and catch their flight. 
Staffers at the airport noticed the baby in the carrier and stopped the couple, who were later taken in for questioning 
by the police. 
The baby's parents are Belgian passport holders and were traveling from Tel Aviv to Brussels when the incident 
took place, the Israel Airports Authority said Tuesday. The couple had arrived late for their Ryanair flight and found 
that the check-in counters were already closed, according to the Times of Israel[1]. 
In addition to not having a ticket for their baby, the couple refused to pay for another ticket and eventually left the 
little boy in his carrier at the check-in counter. They rushed towards the security check but were eventually 
intercepted by the airport staff. 
The workers told the parents to collect their baby and also informed airport security and the police about the 
incident. Cops reportedly took the parents in for questioning, and it is unclear if they managed to catch their flight to 
Brussels. 
The airlines released a statement and said it was the first time they dealt with such an experience. 
"All the workers were in shock. We have never seen anything like that. We didn't believe what we were seeing," the 
statement said. 
The Israel Airports Authority later said the couple, on finding the check-in counters closed when they arrived at 
Terminal 1, left the baby on the conveyor belt so they could go and deal with security, the Jerusalem Post[2] 
reported. 
In an unrelated incident[3] reported in 2019, a woman traveling on a flight from Saudi Arabia to Kuala Lumpur in 
Malaysia had left behind her baby at the airport. After realizing her baby was not with her, the woman refused to 
continue on the journey and asked the pilot to turn the mid-air flight around. The conversation between the air traffic 
controllers and the pilot was shared in a video, where the pilot was heard saying a passenger had left her baby in 
the waiting area. The flight eventually returned to King Abdul Aziz International Airport.

Boeing gains 40 787, Max orders
Boeing gains 40 787, Max orders
AirFinance Journal

Body
Boeing logged orders for 40 new commercial aircraft in January - seven widebody 787-10s and 33 737 Max units.
Twenty-five of the Max aircraft were contracted by an undisclosed customer, while Japan's Skymark Airlines and 
Germany's Tui Group added orders for four Max aircraft each last month.
The seven 787-10 orders are listed as an undisclosed customer order for the time being.
Separately, market sources tell Airfinance Journal that Qatar Airways will begin taking delivery of 737 Max aircraft 
this year.
The airline had agreed to take 25 737 Max 10s but as type certification is proving more challenging than expected 
Qatar has now agreed to take Max 8s instead, the sources say. This was mostly a result of Qatar needing 
additional narrowbody capacity quickly, they note, adding that Boeing can supply Max 8s relatively quickly owing to 
cancelled orders, Russian sanctions, and Chinese backlog.
Qatar Airways operates more than 120 Boeing aircraft including 777 and 787 passenger jets along with 747 and 
777 freighters.
Deliveries
Boeing delivered 38 aircraft to customers in January, down from 69 aircraft handed over in December.
The January deliveries included 35 737 Max units and three 787s.
Southwest Airlines took the most Max aircraft, accounting for 12 units. This was followed by Ryanair (five), ALC

Once Europe's largest regional airline, Flybe may be dead for good this time. Not one but two European airline 
startups that launched or relaunched during the Covid-19 pandemic are facing financial collapse, both announced 
within the span of a weekend.
On Saturday, regional United Kingdom airline Flybe announced that it "has now ceased trading and all flights from 
and to the UK operated by Flybe have been cancelled and will not be rescheduled." Once the largest independent 
regional airline in Europe, operating more than half of UK domestic flights outside London, had previously collapsed 
in 2020.
The company was rescued the next year by Thyme Opco, a firm linked to US hedge fund Cyrus Capital, and 
relaunched last spring. It is in bankruptcy only eight months later.
"Please note that Flybe is unfortunately not able to arrange alternative flights for passengers," the airline's website 
says. The Civil Aviation Authority is advising consumers booked on Flybe flights on how to recoup their money.
On Monday, Norwegian startup Flyr announced that its inability to raise the cash it needs had led to a "critical short-
term liquidity situation." The media release said the airline was exploring "whether there are feasible alternatives to 
secure continued operations" but warned that there was "no guarantee that a solution that would create a 
meaningful shareholder value for the current shareholders will be found."
The airline launched its first domestic flights in June 2021 and expanded with international flights two months later.
The airline's already-battered share price fell 50% to a low of 0.0030 euros ($0.003).
While the early days of the pandemic brought air travel to a halt, the crisis also changed the landscape of aviation 
with the launches of a bumper crop of small, regional, low-cost airlines around the world. North America now has a 
quartet of new budget airlines: Breeze Airways and Avelo Airlines in the US, and Jetlines and Lynx in Canada. 
Another startup, Aha! Airlines, launched in October 2021 but called it quits last August.
Latin America welcomed Colombia's Ultra Air, Ecuador's Equair, and the Dominican Republic's Arajet. Travelers in 
Asia can now fly VietTravel in Vietnam and Akasa Air in India. Lift, Green Africa, and Ibom Air are new airlines in 
Africa.
Two European airlines go bust over the weekend
Two pandemic-launched airlines - Iceland's Play Airlines and Norway's Norse Atlantic Airways - offer low-cost 
flights between Europe and the United States.
Notably, the bottom is not falling out on low-cost regional carriers across the board, particularly those that are well 
established. Ireland-based Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, on Monday posted a record $229-million profit 
for the last three months of 2022 and crowed about robust demand for spring and summer 2023. forbes.com

Lawyers representing Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) have asked a Delaware judge to dismiss a defamation 
claim from the online travel agency (OTA), Booking.com, in the latest installment of a long-running legal battle 
between the airline and OTA concerning screen scraping of fares.
Appearing before the District of Delaware US Federal District Court in Wilmington on January 13, 2023, lawyers 
from two legal firms, Holland and Knight, and Offit Kurman representing Ryanair rejected Booking.com's claims that 
Ryanair "publicly disparaged" the OTA, sent "accusatory and disparaging emails" to customers who purchased 
Ryanair tickets via the site, and said Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary made "false and misleading" statements about 
the OTA.
Ryanair originally sued Booking.com and its subsidiaries Agoda, Priceline, and Kayak in 2020 over screen scraping, 
a practice whereby an OTA accesses an airline's website, extracting availability and fare data, and sells a ticket via 
its own website. Ryanair's terms and conditions ban this practice. Ryanair sells tickets at or below cost and 
generally generates a profit by selling ancillary services. OTA ticket sales deprive it of the opportunity to generate 
this additional revenue.
In 2022, Booking.com countersued Ryanair over alleged defamatory accusations and misrepresentations to 
Booking.com customers, which the OTA says damaged its brand. These latest court hearings are an attempt to 
have this countersuit dismissed. In their application to dismiss, the airline's legal representatives told Judge William 
C. Bryson that Booking.com's claims are "based on a limited set of communications purportedly sent by Ryanair to 
Booking.com customers or posted on Ryanair's social media. They say Booking.com's counterclaims are fatally 
flawed because the purported statements never identify Booking.com, instead stating truthfully that Ryanair does 
not authorise online travel agencies to sell Ryanair flights."
Ryanair's counsel argued the OTA had selectively chosen excerpts from communications to suggest they are false 
or disparaging when Booking.com is not mentioned by name. "Booking.com has therefore failed to sufficiently 
allege defamation," the Ryanair filing notes. The defendants are due to file their answering brief and response by 
the end of January.

Airlines face flight disruptions at Paris Orly due to French strike action

Airlines across Europe and Northern Africa are grappling with disruptions to scheduled operations to Paris-Orly 
(ORY) due to ongoing nationwide strike action in France.
In a statement released on January 29, 2023, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced that a 
two-day nationwide industrial strike will be taking place in France from January 30 to February 1, 2023.
The DGCA revealed that air traffic to and from Paris-Orly would be disrupted and that passengers and airlines 
should expect cancellations and delays. The DGCA also asked airlines to reduce their flight schedules by 20% for 
the duration of the strike action.
Since the start of the strike action, airlines such as Air France, Ryanair, easyJet and Royal Air Maroc have all 
announced reduced services or disruptions to their operations in and out of Paris-Orly.
Air France cuts 10% of short and medium-haul flights
In a statement released in response to the DGCA strike alert, Air France announced that it would trim its schedule 
and operate 90% of its short and medium-haul flights.
The airline highlighted that it would operate "all of its long-haul flights" but urged passengers to be cautious of last-
minute delays and cancellations.
Ryanair cancels flights, calls on EU commission to protect overflights during strikes
Ryanair released a statement announcing that it had been "forced to cancel a small number of flights to/from 
France," on January 31, 2023 due to the French Air Traffic Control (ATC) strike.
"It is inexplicable that the EU Commission continues to sit on their hands and ignore the widespread impact that 
these French ATC strikes have on EU passengers who are not even travelling to/from France, while the French 
Govt use their minimum services policy to protect French domestic flights for French citizens," said Ryanair's Neal 
McMahon.
"Ryanair once again calls on the EU Commission under Ursula Von Der Leyen to take immediate action to protect 
European citizens travelling from the likes of Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the UK whose travel plans will be 
Airlines face flight disruptions at Paris Orly due to French strike action
needlessly disrupted today (31 Jan) due to the EU Commission's repeated inaction to protect overflights when 
French ATC go on strike," McMahon added.
Royal Air Maroc cancels flights to Paris-Orly airport
Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has also joined the list of airlines forced to trim their schedules due to the strike action in 
France.
"Following the civil service strike notice in France on January 31, 2023, all airlines have been asked to reduce their 
flight schedule for the day at Paris-Orly airport and Royal Air Maroc supports its customers by transferring them to 
other flights," RAM said in a statement, which was reported by Morocco World News.
easyJet notifies passengers of disruptions during industrial action
In a statement released on its website, easyJet announced it was expecting flights to and from French airports to be 
affected by the national strike in France, which was joined by Air Traffic Control staff.
easyJet also advised passengers to be cautious of delays with public transport services, recommending 
passengers "allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport and consider alternative transport options".
The national strike is part of ongoing protests in France to oppose the French government's planned reform, which 
includes raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.

RYANAIR has posted its largest third quarter profit after tax for the winter quarter as a boom in demand helped it 
soar past pre-pandemic levels.
In the three months ending 31 December, the Dublin-based carrier reported a pre-tax profit of (EURO)211m 
(£184.9m), up from last year's loss of (EURO)96m.
This was also up on the (EURO)88m profit reported in the third quarter of its 2020 financial year. Ryanair added 
that the average fare paid was 14 per cent higher during the same period.
Revenue surged 57 per cent to reach (EURO)2.31bn after passenger levels topped 38.4m with a load factor of 93 
per cent.
In a statement, the airline said: "Ryanair secured strong market share gains in key EU markets as we operated 112 
per cent of our pre-Covid capacity during the first nine months of the 2023 financial year."
Chief executive Michael O'Leary told investors yesterday the carrier is better equipped for growth compared to both 
low-cost rivals such as Easyjet and Wizz Air as well as legacy airlines.
"There's been an extraordinary widening of the unit cost gap between us and every other airline in Europe," O'Leary 
said.
According to Ryanair calculations, unit costs have dropped to (EURO)30 per seat while those of competitors have 
surged, with Easyjet's up 42 per cent and IAG's 60 per cent.
Travel rebound sees Ryanair profit skyrocket
"It's one of the reasons why we are continuing to grow so strongly but also why profitability has rebounded strongly 
this year," he continued.
O'Leary added that the low-cost airline was expecting very "robust demand" for Easter and the summer seasons as 
more tourists return to Europe from abroad due to a strong dollar and China's reopening of its border.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has forecast that a rush of US and Asian tourists will boost demand in 
Europe this summer, after the lowcost airline reported record profitability despite the economic downturn. O'Leary 
said early bookings showed that Europe's largest airline was on track for a "strong" summer, following its most 
profitable December quarter on record.
The relative strength of the US dollar and the end of most border restrictions had encouraged long-haul travellers to 
make bookings to travel to Europe once more, he said.
"With Asian tourists now returning and a strong US dollar encouraging Americans to explore Europe, we're seeing 
robust demand for Easter and summer 2023 flights," he said.
The bullish outlook comes as several European airlines have reported strong ticket sales, with few signs that the 
slowdown in Europe is hitting demand.
Chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said there had been no signs of economic worries hitting ticket sales. "If you 
look back to the global financial crisis it was evident that whatever people save money on, travel was not one of 
those things," he said.
Ryanair yesterday reported profit after tax of (EURO)211mn for the three months to the end of December, against a 
loss of (EURO)96mn a year previously, when border restrictions were still stifling travel.

The results were a record, and came after particularly strong demand over the October half-term and peak 
Christmas and new year holiday season, Ryanair said.
The carrier said fares were strong "across the board", and passengers paid fares 14 per cent higher than in the 
comparable quarter three years ago, before Covid-19 struck.
Ryanair's record results came just 48 hours after smaller UK airline Flybe collapsed into administration for the 
second time in three years, leaving thousands of passengers stranded.
Europe's leading low-cost airlines base their businesses on attracting passengers through comparatively cheap 
fares by keeping their own costs low and filling their planes.
Ryanair said yesterday it had driven down its unit costs in the fourth quarter to (EURO)30 per passenger excluding 
fuel, and that its planes were 93 per cent full over the period.
The company reiterated its forecast of a profit after tax of between (EURO)1.325bn and (EURO)1.425bn for its 
financial year ending in March, but said it expected the final quarter to be lossmaking because Easter fell outside 
the period.
The airline said it expected 168mn passengers to fly in the 12 months to the end of March, which would be another 
record, and for this to rise to 185mn over the following financial year.

For the second time in nearly as many years, beleaguered regional airline Flybe Group (AIM:FLYB) has ceased all 
flights and operations after entering into administration on Saturday, leaving ticketholders and cabin crew out of 
pocket and out of work.
Having returned to the skies less than one year earlier after entering into administration for the first time in March 
2020, it seems unlikely that Flybe will be third-time lucky, as the controls get handed over to joint administrators at 
Interpath David Pike & Mike Pink.
"We are sad to announce that Flybe has been placed into administration," Tweeted the company, adding: 
"Regretfully, Flybe has now ceased trading. All Flybe flights from and to the UK are cancelled and will not be 
rescheduled."
Based in Birmingham, Flybe operated flights on 21 routes to 17 destinations via a fleet of eight leased Q400 
turboprop aircraft.
The collapse comes at a time of resurgence for the UK and European sector, with Ryanair Holdings PLC 
(LSE:RYA), easyJet plc and Wizz Air plc all showing extremely promising results in their latest earnings reports.
So where did it go wrong for Flybe?
"A tale of two very different airlines has unfolded today. Flybe staff face a painful period of adjustment following the 
airline's collapse, while Ryanair results show it's flying high as pent-up demand for short-haul holidays surges," 
commented Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
A tale of two airlines: Flybe goes bust as Ryanair soars
Streeter continued: "It seems Flybe could not jet past problems, which began piling up during the pandemic. 
Although the business was revived after being bought out by Thyme Opco, the largely domestic routes it operated 
on faced competition from other forms of transportation.
"Hybrid working means the number of business meetings has rebased at a lower level than pre-pandemic times, 
and with eco-focused passengers choosing the train to take the strain, when possible, regional hopper flights are 
clearly proving less popular."
Where Flybe primarily accommodated business trips, Ryanair (and easyJet and Wizz Air for that matter) has tapped 
into what Streeter said was "pent-up demand for holidays consumers were starved of during the pandemic, with 
routes into a myriad of destinations on travellers wish-lists.".
Looking back on Flybe
Once Britain's largest regional carrier, Flybe - derived from the company's less catchy previous name British 
European - first entered administration in March 2020, just as the Covid-19 pandemic was laying waste to Britain's 
airline sector.
Its financial problems didn't start there; one year prior, a joint venture comprising Stobart Group, Virgin Atlantic and 
the Cyrus Capital hedge fund received clearance from European regulators to take over the struggling business for 
£2.8mln. Corovavirus was simply the nail in the first of Flybe's coffins.
Flybe resumed flights in April 2022, but the carrier was welcomed back to a changed regional aviation landscape. 
Competitors began encroaching into Flybe's territory during its leave of absence, specifically Loganair in the north 
and Aurigny in the south, both of whom were signing codeshare agreements with Blue Islands and Eastern Airways 
respectively.
These competitors muscled in on approximately 44% of the domestic routes vacated by Flybe in 2020, forcing 
Flybe to pivot to lesser-serviced regional hubs.
Evidently, there was not enough space even for a substantially downsized Flybe, causing the group to enter into 
administration once again on Saturday, January 28.
easyJet and Ryanair extend a lifeline
While would-be passengers have been thoroughly inconvenienced by the collapse, Flybe's 250-strong workforce is 
facing the prospect of unemployment.
Thankfully, it could have come at a worse time, especially for cabin crew- easyJet has around 250 vacancies in its 
London bases for staff members willing to move down from Birmingham.
Ryanair has also encouraged former Flybe staff to apply for available roles, including flight crew, cabin crew, 
engineering, ground staff and office staff positions. "We will endeavor to get you back into employment as soon as 
possible," the company stated.
Staff shortages have plagued the airline industry in recent years, with Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary taking aim at 
the UK government's "bizarre" post-Brexit immigration policies which he contended contributed to last summer's 
mass flight cancellations.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has launched a recruitment drive to hire aviation specialists from Ukraine.
The Dublin-based airline is hiring pilots and cabin crew so that will be ready to return to its former bases in Ukraine 
when the ongoing war with Russia ends, chief executive (CEO) Michael O'Leary said in a conference on January 
30, 2023, as reported by Reuters.
"We are hiring quite a number of Ukraine pilots and cabin crew specifically so that we can restore bases in Ukraine 
if and when it is safe to do so. [...] We are very committed to returning to Ukraine as soon as it is safe to do so," the 
CEO explained.
In March 2022, Michael O'Leary said Ryanair will become the first airline to return to Ukraine after the war ends. At 
the time, the CEO suspected that commercial flights to the country could be paused until the winter season of 2023.
Before February 24, 2022, when Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, Ryanair had been operating out of five 
Ukrainian airports on a bilateral basis. The low-cost carrier was considering becoming a major investor in the 
country's aviation sector by expanding its services across at least 12 Ukrainian airports and was considering 
deploying up to 20 passenger planes.
According to the airline's recently released financial results, in Q3 of FY22/23, Ryanair announced that it had 
reached a net profit of around $230 million citing "strong pent-up travel demand over the October mid-term and 
peak Christmas/New Year holiday season". The airline's scheduled revenue increased by almost 85% to 
(EURO)1.45 billion during the third quarter, while the total revenue grew by 57% (EURO)2.31 billion.

British regional airline Flybe ceased trading on Saturday (28 January) for the second time in three years. All flights 
were cancelled and 276 workers were made redundant.
A statement on Flybe's website said the airline, which operated scheduled services from Belfast, Birmingham and 
Heathrow across the UK and to Amsterdam and Geneva, had entered administration - a form of protection from 
creditors.
"Flybe has now ceased trading and all flights from and to the UK operated by Flybe have been cancelled and will 
not be rescheduled," it said.
It advised people due to fly not to travel to airports.
A spokesperson for administrators Interpath Advisory said about 75,000 Flybe customers had future bookings that 
would now not be honoured.
What should you do if your Flybe flight is cancelled?
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says that if you booked directly with Flybe and paid more than £100 
((EURO)125) using a credit card you may be able to get your money back under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act. You should contact your credit card company for more information.
Similarly, the CAA says that if you paid by debit card or credit card under £100 ((EURO)125), you should contact 
your card issuer as you might be able to make a claim under their chargeback rules. This means your bank refunds 
the money as it was spent on a service that has not been or won't be provided.
It's a voluntary scheme but most major UK card issuers are signed up for it. They may ask for something called a 
negative response letter which can be found on the CAA's website.
If you booked through a travel agent, it's best to speak to them first as they may have insurance which covers this 
and will be able to inform you of their refund process.
Can I book with another airline?
What to do about your Flybe ticket refund?
Rival airlines are now making 'rescue fares' available to people who have tickets booked with Flybe.
British Airways is offering one-way fares of (EURO)60 (plus taxes, fees and charges) on some routes including a 
checked-in bag of up to 23kg. These can be booked by Flybe customers due to fly between London and Belfast, 
Newcastle or Amsterdam. Passengers will need to call British Airways to make these bookings.
Ryanair is offering fares starting at £29.99 ((EURO)34) to customers affected by Flybe cancellations. Families that 
booked to travel on now-cancelled journeys can travel on one of the low-cost carrier's flights including routes from 
Belfast to East Midlands, Manchester and London Stansted. Bookings can be made on the Ryanair website.
Flybe customers can also travel with easyJet which is offering £49 ((EURO)56) fares for domestic routes and £79 
((EURO)90) fares for international routes. These include a 15kg checked-in bag and are available if you present 
your original Flybe booking.
These easyJet flights are available until 5 February and you will need to call the airline's customer service line to 
make a booking.
What happened to Flybe?
Headquartered in Birmingham, Flybe operated flights on 21 routes to 17 destinations across the UK and Europe 
using a fleet of eight leased aircraft.
David Pike and Mike Pink from Interpath were appointed joint administrators to Flybe.
Pike said Flybe had struggled to withstand a number of shocks since its relaunch last year, not least the late 
delivery of 17 aircraft which severely compromised its efforts to build back capacity and remain competitive.
He said scaled-back elements of Flybe's operating platform would be preserved for a short period while there was a 
possibility of a rescue transaction. He encouraged any interested party to make contact urgently.
A spokesperson for Interpath said 45 members of Flybe's 321-strong workforce had been retained for the time 
being.
"It is always sad to see an airline enter administration and we know that Flybe's decision to stop trading will be 
distressing for all its employees and customers," said Paul Smith, the UK Civil Aviation Authority's consumer 
director.
Collapsing for the second time in three years
Hurt by Britain's COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Flybe first fell into administration in March 2020, impacting 2,400 
jobs.
In October 2020, it was sold to Thyme Opco Ltd, a firm controlled by Cyrus Capital. In April 2022 it resumed flights, 
albeit on a smaller scale.
Flybe's demise contrasts with a post-pandemic pick-up in demand for air travel.
Low-cost airlines Ryanair - Europe's biggest airline - and Britain's easyJet have reported record bookings 
for summer holidays, indicating that consumers are still keen on trips despite a looming recession.
Louise Haigh, the opposition Labour Party's transport spokesperson, said Flybe's collapse was "devastating news" 
for staff and customers.
"Protection for passengers is simply not strong enough - and ministers have sat on their hands for years and failed 
to introduce long-promised airline insolvency laws," she said.
The Unite trade union said the government had failed to learn lessons from Flybe's first collapse.

Ryanair Rebounds Into Profit As Bookings Soar

Jan 30, 2023( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ireland's Ryanair flew back into profit in the final three months of 2022 as travellers flocked to budget airlines 
during Europe's cost-of-living crisis. 
Ryanair logged a profit after taxation of 211 million euros ($229 million) for the third quarter of its financial year, or 
three months to the end of December. 
That contrasted sharply with a net loss of 96 million euros last time around, it added in a results statement on 
Monday. 
Passenger numbers soared by almost a quarter to 38.4 million passengers. That marked a seven percent increase 
compared with late 2019, just before the Covid pandemic ravaged demand for aviation. 
The Dublin-based carrier enjoyed "strong Christmas/New Year traffic" in the reporting period, winning market share 
in key EU nations including Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain. 
Monday's news comes after British budget rival EasyJet last week hiked its annual profit forecast after record 
demand, as its customers also prioritised holidays and shrugged off sky-high inflation. 
Yet it also follows the weekend collapse of regional UK airline Flybe, which on Saturday filed for bankruptcy for the 
second time in three years, faced with fierce competition. 
Both EasyJet and Ryanair have urged Flybe staff to apply for roles. 
Britain, Ryanair's key market outside Ireland, is widely expected to fall into recession this year on the back of 
rocketing consumer prices. 
However, budget carriers have thrived over the festive period. 
"Ryanair has built on its strong position of having a low cost base, strong liquidity and a ready workforce, 
substantially retained through the pandemic," independent aviation analyst John Strickland told AFP. 
"All this translates into an ability to provide growing capacity to meet resurgent demand from customers focussed 
more than ever on value for money pricing. 
"Ryanair has turned every crisis to its advantage over the last 20 years or so and this confirms the strength of the 
low cost business model." 
Nevertheless, Ryanair cautioned Monday that it still expects to register a loss for the last quarter of its fiscal year, 
partly because Easter falls in April this year.

Earlier this month, the carrier predicted annual net profit of between 1.325 billion euros and 1.425 billion euros, 
upgrading prior guidance on solid festive bookings.

 Ryanair on Monday posted a record after-tax profit for its October-December quarter and said bookings for Easter 
and summer flights were "very robust", boosted by demand from Asian travellers and a strong U.S. dollar. 
"Bookings are showing no signs of recession at this point in time," Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan told Reuters. 
"We had record bookings in week two and week three of January, very robust demand into Easter and the summer 
without fare stimulation," he said. 
Last week, rivals Wizz Air and EasyJet also reported strong summer bookings.  
Ryanair, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, said it had earned 211 million euros ($229.40 million) in the three 
months ended Dec. 31, the third quarter of its financial year.  
The after-tax profit numbers compared with a forecast of 200 million euros in a company poll of analysts and its 
previous record of 106 million euros in the final three months of 2017. 
Sorahan would not reiterate a forecast made earlier in the month by Chief Executive Michael O'Leary that fares 
were likely to post annual high-single-digit percentage growth in the coming summer, saying only that he was 
"encouraged by bookings at this point." 
Graphic: Record Christmas quarter performance  
Ryanair reiterated its Jan. 4 forecast of an after-tax profit of between 1.325 billion and 1.425 billion euros for the 
year through March 31. That was an upgrade of an earlier forecast of 1 billion-1.2 billion euros. 
Shares in the airline were down 1.1% at 15.36 euros at 0840 GMT but were up more than 25% since the start of the 
year.  
"There is always a danger that the market is disappointed if it gets what it expects," Goodbody stockbrokers said in 
a note.  
UK BOOKINGS IMPROVE 
Demand weakness in the United Kingdom reported earlier in January has disappeared and may have been due to 
transport strikes in the country, O'Leary said in a video presentation.  
"With Asian tourists now returning and a strong U.S. dollar encouraging Americans to explore Europe, we're seeing 
robust demand," O'Leary said.  
Ryanair Posts Record Christmas Quarter, Sees 'Very Robust' Summer Demand
Ryanair, unlike many airlines, kept its pilots and crew up-to-date with their flying hours during the pandemic to take 
advantage of the swift rebound and flew a record 38.4 million passengers in the final three months of 2022.  
It expects to fly 168 million passengers in the year through March 31, well above its previous annual record of 149 
million reached before the pandemic brought the travel industry to a standstill. Passenger numbers are set to hit 
185 million in the next financial year, O'Leary said.

       Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its third quarter profit attributable to equity holders of parent 
was 202.1 million euros or 0.1773 euros per share compared to a loss of 95.8 million euros or 0.0847 euros per 
share in the same quarter last year.
 Scheduled revenues increased by 84% to 1.45 billion euros due to a 24% increase in traffic and 48% higher 
average fares.
 Total operating revenues for the third quarter grew to 2.31 billion euros from 1.47 billion euros in the prior year.
 While bookings continue to be closer-in than in spring 2020 (pre-Covid), the company said it has reasonable 
visibility for the remainder of fiscal year 2023, with fiscal year traffic guided at 168 million.
 Ryanair expects fourth quarter to be loss making due to the absence of Easter from March.
 As announced on 4 January, the company expects fiscal year 2023 profit after tax (pre-exceptionals) to be in a 
range of 1.325 billion euros - 1.425 billion euros compared to the prior estimation of 1.00 billion euros - 1.20 billion 
euros. The guidance remains heavily dependent upon avoiding adverse events in the fourth quarter such as Covid 
and/or the war in Ukraine.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a swing to third-quarter profit, with results boosted by 
higher prices and stronger demand over the Christmas period. 
The Dublin-based budget airline posted revenue of EUR2.31 billion in the three months to December 31, up 57% 
from EUR1.47 billion a year earlier. 
Ryanair swung to a pretax profit of EUR212.8 million from a EUR132.8 million loss. It reported a net profit before 
exceptional items of EUR211 million, swinging from a loss of EUR96 million. 
The company hailed "strong travel demand" over the festive period and said fares were 14% higher than pre-Covid 
levels. 
Customer numbers surged 24% on-year to 38.4 million from 31.1 million. Ryanair's load factor improved to 93% 
from 84%. 
Ryanair expects traffic of 168 million for all of financial 2023, which ends on March 31, up from the 97.1 million in 
financial 2022. 
The company still put its pre-exceptional items net profit guidance range to EUR1.33 billion to EUR1.43 billion. That 
guidance was lifted from EUR1.00 billion to EUR1.20 billion earlier in January. 
It would represent a swing from a EUR355 million loss in financial 2022. 
It expects to be loss-making in the fourth-quarter, however, due to when Easter falls in 2023.

Jan 30, 2023( ValueWalk: https://www.valuewalk.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 FTSE 100 opens in negative territory ahead of crucial central bank[1] meetings this week. Cautious confidence is 
returning to the UK according to the Lloyds Bank Business Barometer. Ryanair posts record profits for the third 
quarter, boosted by pent-up demand for travel. Unilever names its new CEO asHein Schumacher, the boss of a 
Dutch dairy giant US futures point to a lower open for Wall Street ahead of crunch Fed meeting 
Q4 2022 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2] 
Caution About Interest Rate Decisions 
Caution is reigning over markets at the start of a crucial week in terms of central bank policies, with decisions on 
interest rate hikes due. The FTSE 100[3] has opened down in early trade with commodity stocks lower as concern 
still swirls about the global economy and what the path of rate rises. 
Cautious confidence is returning to the UK, driven by a much more upbeat reading for the wider economy, 
sentiment which has already been washing through financial markets and is set to continue in early trade today. 
The Lloyds Bank Business Barometer shows pessimism is ebbing away, as inflation is starting to trend lower 
despite the expectations of a fresh rate hike from the Bank of England on Thursday. 
Overall confidence increased five points to 22% this month, with 46% of firms expecting stronger trading ahead. 
There are hopes that with this renewed optimism, firms will start investing to grow their businesses to help kick-start 
growth in the wider economy. 
Ryanair Lifts 
The fight for talent has been made a little bit easier for Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY) and easyJet[4] plc 
(LON:EZJ) who are both on standby to scoop up staff from Flybe which collapsed over the weekend. 
Ryanair is flying high on pent-up demand for travel as people still wanted to satisfy their wanderlust over the last 
three months of 2022, despite the cost-of-living crisis raging. It pushed up profits to a record for the third quarter 
and there are no signs of sales slowing down. The numbers sailed past expectations, with profits jumping to EUR 
211 million. 
Caution About Interest Rate Decisions, Ryanair Lifts And Unilever Names CEO
Spring and Summer bookings surged to record levels in the cold dark days of mid-January as people under 
blankets on the sofa dreamed of a spot on the sun lounger, and snapped up seats. Already tourists from Asia have 
started to return, fuelling demand and there are hopes that the growing optimism as infection rates slow, will see 
more high-spending travellers from China taking their seats, and buying the lucrative add-ons. 
Unilever Names CEO 
Unilever plc (LON:ULVR) has been managing to navigate through the turbulence pretty adeptly, and the 
appointment of a new CEO, Hein Schumacher has been greeted positively by the market, in expectation he will 
help steady the ship further. He's the current CEO of the Dutch dairy and food giant, FrieslandCampina, so he'll be 
seen as both a safe pair on hands and a fresh injection of ideas for the company. 
Unilever has been proving resilient, by pushing record price hikes onto consumers but there will come a limit and 
brand pulling power alone won't sustain this indefinitely. Already volumes are falling slightly and at the same time 
the company is having to spend hefty sums on marketing to keep products front and centre in customers minds. 
Although rate rises are causing the US economy[5] to slip up, hopes have come in flurries that it will still have a soft 
landing. But there is nervousness ahead of the crucial Fed meeting this week, and US futures reflect this with the 
S&P 500 expected to open lower. 
The interest rate snowball is gathering speed, and its squashing down demand in its path. The core Personal 
Consumption Expenditures Price Index, increased 4.4% in December, the lowest rise since October 2021. Given 
that the Fed's preferred measure is showing signs of slowing, and consumer spending fell again, the expectations 
are that a 0.25% rise is on the cards on Wednesday.''

 The return of Asian traffic to Europe and a particularly strong transatlantic market will likely see robust demand for 
Ryanair[1] from Easter in its Q1 FY24 through the summer period. With other airlines still at lower capacity 
compared to pre-pandemic levels and Ryanair up, the Irish airline group thinks it is well-positioned to benefit from 
demand “and hopefully from higher fares”, CEO Michael O’Leary said during today’s Q3 FY23 earnings call. 
Ryanair expects to benefit from Asian and transatlantic traffic. 
Ryanair already saw strong demand in the third quarter, which runs from October through December. October and 
Christmas traffic was good and in a quarter with almost no disruptions, it helped push total revenues up to €2.312 
billion from €1.470 billion. Revenues from 38.4 million passengers (previous year: 31.1 million) were up to €1.447 
billion from €788.1 million. Ancillary revenues like priority boarding, preferred seating, and onboard spending rose to 
€866 million from €682 million or €22.50 per passenger. Load factors were at 93 percent, up from 84. 
Operating costs were up 36 percent to €2.2 billion from €1.6 billion, with fuel costs up 52 percent to €908 million 
and staff costs up by an identical level to €293 million due to pay restoration of staff salaries. Ex-fuel, costs were up 
by 26 percent to €30 per passenger. The result was an operating profit of €161.7 million compared to €-116.7 
million last year. Profit after tax was €211.1 million or €202.1 million if a market-to-market loss on jet fuel caps was 
included, but was way better than the €-95.8 million reported in Q3 FY22. 
After many quarters of stimulating traffic with low fares, airfares were up by fourteen percent over the pre-Covid 
period in Q3. It all helped to grow market share in some key markets, with Italy now at over forty percent from 26, 
Poland at 38 from 27 percent, Ireland at 58 from 49 percent, and Spain at 23 from 21 percent. Forward bookings 
are still close-in, although demand for Easter in April is robust. Ryanair, Malta Air, Buzz, and Lauda plan to operate 
230 new routes, bringing the total to 2.450. Ryanair opened new basis in Belfast, Lanzarote, and Tenerife, but 
closed one at Brussels Charleroi after the airport announced significant cost increases. 
Providing there are no headwinds or adverse news coming from the war in Ukraine or Covid, Ryanair expects a full-
year profit after tax of between €1.325 and €1.425 billion as it said in its latest update on January 4. This is up from 
theNovember guidance[2] of €1.0 and €1.2 billion. It reiterates its guidance to carry 168 million passengers in FY23, 
growing to 185 million in FY24. It is too early to provide guidance for the next financial year. 
MAX deliveries might be pushed out 
Ryanair expects to benefit from Asian and transatlantic traffic
That growth is subject to deliveries from Boeing. The MAX 8200 fleet grew by eleven aircraft in Q3 to 84, providing 
a net fuel consumption benefit over the 737-800 fleet. The first NGs have received the MAX scimitar winglets that 
should reduce fuel burn per aircraft by 1.5 percent. Michael O’Leary counts on the delivery of forty MAX until this 
summer to bring the fleet to 124, but production issues at Boeing could slip some deliveries beyond the summer: 
“Boeing have recently improved in the rate and flow of deliveries but we still think they are facing challenges. We 
aren’t sure if we will get to the 124 aircraft by the end of April. At the moment, we are planning for about 114 
through the peak-summer months. If we can get more of those aircraft before the end of May, we will take them, but 
if they dribble into late June or July, we won’t take those deliveries and dispose of them until the winter.”  
Ryanair ended the quarter with €4.1 billion in liquidity and net debt of €0.96 billion, up from €0.5 billion at the end of 
Q2 thanks to €1.3 billion in capital expenditures. The group reaffirmed it will repay €1.6 billion in bonds in March 
and August. Capex will increase to €2.0 billion in FY23 and to €2.5 billion in FY24, which will be financed from its 
cash position. The carrier is 88 percent hedged for fuel for Q4 at $71 per barrel, sixty percent for HY1 at $90, and 
53 percent for HY2 of FY24. The lower costs per barrel give it a cost advantage this winter and next summer.  
In order to be prepared for the summer growth of ten percent, Ryanair has enrolled over 1.000 cadets in its pilot 
schools and continues training new cabin crew. It will create some 6.000 new jobs. That also includes non-aviation 
positions, including 150 IT specialists.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair reiterated its goal of welcoming 225 million annual passengers by the end of its 2026 
fiscal year (FY26), as the airline continued to deliver positive results.
In Q3 FY23, which ended on December 31, 2022, Ryanair earned (EURO)2.3 billion ($2.5 billion) of revenue, 
ending the three-month period with a profit of (EURO)202.1 million ($220.2), including a (EURO)9 million ($9.8 
million) exceptional charge. The airline's executives repeated claims that the airline is on track to achieve the profit 
guidance issued in early January 2023, when Ryanair estimated its profit to be between (EURO)1.325 and 
(EURO)1.425 billion ($1.444 and $1.552 billion) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.
However, the airline is expected to post a loss for the last quarter of the fiscal year, primarily because in 2023 the 
Easter holidays fall in April.
Ryanair also managed to keep its costs (excluding fuel) under the lid, averaging (EURO)31 ($33.77) per passenger 
in Q3 FY23 and (EURO)30 ($32.68) throughout the first nine months of the same fiscal year. Fuel costs, however, 
rose by 52% in Q3 FY23 compared to Q3 FY22, from (EURO)596.6 million ($650 million) to ($985.3 million).
Ryanair carrying 225 million passengers and new aircraft orders
As the low-cost carrier continued to receive 737 MAX aircraft from Boeing, the company's chief executives said that 
the latest generation 737s will be the backbone of its goal to carry 225 million passengers annually.
"That is going to be our 210 Gamechanger order book of which we had 84 of those aircraft in the fleet at the end of 
December, but we continue to see huge opportunities. There has been a structural change in capacity across 
Europe and we are putting lots of traffic restoration, traffic road deals in place all across Europe," said Neil Sorahan, 
the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Ryanair Group.
"We have already talked about the market share gains that we made and we would anticipate all of that coupled 
with the very strong balance sheet, the hedging book that we have, and the cost advantage that we are in a very 
strong position to deploy traffic all across Europe and grow profitably to 225 million by FY26," Sorahan added.
Ryanair still on track to welcome 225 million passengers by 2026
Ryanair branded the Boeing 737 MAX-8200, a special configuration of the 737 MAX-8 that seats up to 210 
passengers with an extra two doors aft of the wing, as the 'Gamechanger'. The airline's cabin configuration can 
welcome up to 197 passengers.
However, the group's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Michael O'Leary remained skeptical that Boeing would be able 
to meet its aircraft needs, particularly for the upcoming summer peak season. "Boeing have recently improved the 
rate and flow of deliveries, but we still think they're facing challenges. We are not sure we will get the hundred, we 
were supposed to get 124 aircraft by the end of April at the moment," O'Leary said.
According to the Irish executive, the group is currently planning on receiving 114 through the peak summer months. 
"If we can get more of those aircraft from Boeing before the end of May, we will take them. But if they dribble into or 
get delayed into June or July, we will not take those deliveries, we will postpone them to the winter," O'Leary 
continued.
Furthermore, Sorahan said that Ryanair will only order new aircraft if the price is right.

UK Regional Airline Flybe Ceases Trading, Cancels All Flights

Jan 28, 2023( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 British regional airline Flybe on Saturday ceased trading for the second time in three years, cancelling all flights 
and 276 workers made redundant. 
A statement on Flybe's website said the airline, which operated scheduled services from Belfast, Birmingham and 
Heathrow across the UK and to Amsterdam and Geneva, had entered administration, a form of protection from 
creditors. 
"Flybe has now ceased trading and all flights from and to the UK operated by Flybe have been cancelled and will 
not be rescheduled," it said. 
It advised people due to fly not to travel to airports. 
A spokesperson for administrators Interpath Advisory said about 75,000 Flybe customers had future bookings that 
would now not be honoured. 
Headquartered in Birmingham, Flybe operated flights on 21 routes to 17 destinations across the UK and European 
Union using a fleet of eight leased Q400 turboprop aircraft. 
David Pike and Mike Pink from Interpath were appointed joint administrators to Flybe. 
Pike said Flybe had struggled to withstand a number of shocks since its relaunch last year, not least the late 
delivery of 17 aircraft from lessors which severely compromised its efforts to build back capacity and remain 
competitive. 
He said scaled-back elements of Flybe's operating platform would be preserved for a short period while there was a 
possibility of a rescue transaction. He encouraged any interested party to make contact urgently. 
A spokesperson for Interpath said of Flybe's workforce of 321, 45 had been retained for the time being. 
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it would provide advice and information to affected passengers. 
"It is always sad to see an airline enter administration and we know that Flybe's decision to stop trading will be 
distressing for all its employees and customers," said Paul Smith, CAA consumer director. 
Hurt by Britain's COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Flybe first fell into administration in March 2020, impacting 2,400 
jobs. 
In October 2020 it was sold to Thyme Opco Ltd, a firm controlled by Cyrus Capital, and in April 2022 it resumed 
flights, albeit on a smaller scale. 
Flybe's demise contrasts with a post-pandemic pick-up in demand for air travel. 
UK Regional Airline Flybe Ceases Trading, Cancels All Flights
Low cost airlines Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, and Britain's easyJet have reported record bookings for summer 
holidays, in a sign that consumers are still keen on trips despite a looming recession. 
Louise Haigh, the opposition Labour Party's transport spokesperson, said Flybe's collapse was "devastating news" 
for staff and customers. 
"Protection for passengers is simply not strong enough - and ministers have sat on their hands for years and failed 
to introduce long-promised airline insolvency laws," she said.

Stronger winter trading means full-year profit should beat expectations at the budget airline
Ryanair's daily flight numbers last week were at 114 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, but EasyJet has been slower 
off the mark. Its daily flight numbers last week were only at 63 per cent of 2019 levels, according to Eurocontrol.
The airline has been unlucky in that two of its main hubs - London Gatwick and Amsterdam - imposed capacity 
restrictions last summer to cope with the ramp up in activity. Amsterdam's limits are still in place until April.
The airline's trading update for the final three months of 2022 shows clear progress.
Although it recorded another headline loss of £133mn, this was a £100mn improvement on the
Cea rev
Covid-disrupted perioda year earlier. Passenger numbers grew by 47 per cent on the year, and revenue per seat 
was up by 36 per cent.
The average load factor (the ratio of passengers to available seats) rose by 10 per cent and ticket yield grew by 21 
per cent.
EasyJet ( EZJ ) Investors' Chronicle Highlights from this week's issue
On top of this, the company made more from add-ons - airline ancillary revenue also grew by 36 per cent, to £20.12 
per seat.
EasyJet's holidays arm (which launched at the end of 2019 but only really began operating in earnest last year) 
generated a £13mn profit, up from a loss of £1mn a year earlier.
Demand from UK holidaymakers is strong, with 60 per cent of the summer holidays it had planned to sell already 
booked. This was based on the company increasing customer numbers by 30 per cent this year, but given the 
response it has now lifted this target to 50 per cent.

As we finally move into February after what has felt like a six-week month at the start of the year, there is a packed 
financial calendar for investors to gulp down, including rate hikes from the three big central banks and plenty of 
company updates.
In London there's Shell, GSK, BT, Vodafone and Entain, while earnings season rumbles on across the pond, with 
more tech titans Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms updating, plus the likes of McDonalds and Exxon 
Mobil.
MONDAY 30 JANUARY
Following easyJet and Wizz Air last week, it's the turn of Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) on Monday.
The Irish budget airline already provided a third-quarter update earlier this month, with passenger numbers lighter 
than expected.
Analysts at UBS said this week's Ryanair statement is "more about outlook".
Elsewhere, Computacenter PLC (LSE:CCC) will upload its pre-close statement, with analysts expecting North 
America to remain strong and the UK to remain softer, showing how its corporate customers are reacting to the 
economic backdrop.
Week ahead brings rate hikes and results a-gogo: Shell, GSK , BT , Vodafone , Apple , Amazon and Meta
Across in the US, Exxon Mobil will be one of those releasing earnings, days after analysts at Citigroup 
suggested BP and Shell may find themselves negotiating a megamerger with their American peers.
Significant announcements expected on Monday
Finals: SThree PLC (LSE:STEM)
Trading updates: Computacenter PLC, DP Eurasia NV, Ryanair Holdings PLC
AGMs: Bluebird Merchants Ventures Ltd, Contango Holdings (LSE:CGO) PLC, Hollywood Bowl Group PLC 
(LSE:BOWL), SkinBioTherapeutics PLC (AIM:SBTX), Webis Holdings (AIM:WEB) LC
US earnings Monday: ExxonMobil, Pfizer, UPS, AMD, NXP Semiconductors, General Motors, Spotify, Western 
Digital, Juniper
TUESDAY 31 JANUARY
Pets at Home Group PLC (LSE:PETS) will be one of those getting attention on Tuesday ahead of the busier diary 
later in the week.
A third-quarter update will see investors likely to be focused on whether the pressure on the retailer's profit margins 
has eased since November.
Among the small caps, there may be extra attention on ITM Power PLC (AIM:ITM) after the hydrogen electrolysis 
specialist appointed Dennis Schulz as its new chief executive.
Analysts expect Schulz to provide a new strategic plan alongside the results, which may include updates on the 
expansion of its facility in Sheffield and longer-term expansion goals. 
Significant announcements expected on Tuesday
Finals: Standard Life Private Equity Trust
Interims: ITM Power PLC, NWF Group PLC (AIM:NWF)
Trading updates: Hochschild Mining PLC (LSE:HOC, OTCQX:HCHDF), Pets At Home Group PLC
AGMs: Mobiles Streams PLC, Residential Secure Income REIT PLC (AIM:SIR), Team PLC (AIM:TEAM), Treatt 
PLC
Economic announcements: Employment Cost Index (US), House Price Index (US), Consumer Confidence (US), 
Nationwide House Price Index (UK), Consumer Credit (UK), M4 Money Supply (UK), Mortgage Approvals (UK)
US earnings Tuesday: McDonalds
WEDNESDAY 1 FEBRUARY
Kicking off the new month are a trio of intriguing London blue-chips, with the US Fed decision to grab all the 
headlines later.
In London, heavyweight pharma contender GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK), which has done well enough since 
the Haleon consumer products arm was spun out last summer, but investors will feel the shares could do with 
another shot in the arm.
For something a bit leftfield, analysts suggest management could discuss offloading more of the residual stake in 
Haleon.
Week ahead brings rate hikes and results a-gogo: Shell, GSK , BT , Vodafone , Apple , Amazon and Meta
Fourth-quarter numbers from Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) should deliver good news if its recent BetMGM joint venture 
update is anything to go by, but not necessarily if results from rival William Hill were the guide.
The update is going to be where we see exactly how the FIFA World Cup impacted revenues for the Ladbrokes and 
Sportingbet owner.
Stakes are seen as being higher for Vodafone Group PLC (LSE:VOD) when its discloses its third-quarter results, 
with the beleaguered Anglo-German telecoms group having cut its full-year earnings and cash flow forecasts last 
November.
Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is one of the stars in the US later, with the shares having plunging sharply back 
in the autumn but rebounding from seven-year lows over 50% since.
Earnings in October missed expectations with guidance lowered on Q4 revenues to between $30bn to $32.5bn, 
with the Reality Labs division continuing to haemorrhage cash and rivals such as TikTok pulling users away from 
Instagram, as well as rising costs.
Boss Mark Zuckerberg slashed 11,000 jobs weeks later, which seemed to help the stock price. 
Earnings are expected to come in at $2.25 per share. 
Significant announcements expected on Wednesday
Finals: GSK PLC
Trading updates: Entain PLC, Gem Diamonds Ltd, Glencore PLC (LSE:GLEN), Restore Plc (AIM:RST), Severn 
Trent PLC (LSE:SVT), Virgin Money UK PLC (LSE:VMUK), Vodafone Group PLC

Economic announcements: BRC Shop Price Index (UK), PMI Manufacturing (UK), MBA Mortgage Applications 
(US), Construction Spending (US), ISM Manufacturing (US)
US earnings Wednesday: Merck, Altria, Conoco Phillips, Qualcomm, Starbuck's, Qorvo, Estee Lauder, Pinterest, 
Coherent, Harley- Davidson, Cirrus Logic, Microchip, Meta Platforms, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO)
THURSDAY 2 FEBRUARY
Ahead of Thursday's Bank of England and ECB policy decisions, company results include finals from Shell PLC 
(LSE:SHEL, NYSE:SHEL) could provide more insight into the ongoing review of its residential energy wing, as well 
as windfall taxes.
Shareholder returns and renewables intentions will be under the most intense investor scrutiny, with one set of 
analysts arguing the present plans to increase dividends by 15% and repurchase more than US$18bln of shares 
are not nearly enough.
Elsewhere among the blue-chips, BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) has been getting some bullish broker support ahead 
of its results, especially for any investors who have held on through the 70-plus decline in the four years leading up 
to the pandemic.
In focus will be the above-inflation price hikes pencilled in for the coming months and an update on merger talks 
with Three UK - with the group seen as "walking either the tightrope or the plank" going into its quarterlies.
Week ahead brings rate hikes and results a-gogo: Shell, GSK , BT , Vodafone , Apple , Amazon and Meta
Across the Atlantic, the giant tech trio of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc release 
earnings after the closing bell in New York, with recent weeks being characterised by jobs cut announcements 
around the sector.
For Apple, where Q1 numbers tend to be the company's best quarter, expectations have been tempered by the 
problems with its China supply chains and production shutdowns at Foxconn before Christmas.
Google owner Alphabet's prior quarter saw ad revenue come in below expectations, YouTube revenues declining 
but the cloud business a big silver lining - which news has been followed by announcements about thousands of job 
cuts.
Amazon also disappointed with its last quarter, especially with guidance for sales of between $140bn to $148bn for 
the pre-Christmas period, well below the US$155.5bn that had been forecast, partly due to a strong US dollar. 
Costs will also be watched after rising sharply over the last nine months.
Significant announcements expected on Thursday

Economic announcements: Continuing Claims (US), Initial Jobless Claims (US), Factory Orders (US)
US earnings Thursday: Amazon, Apple, Eli Lilly, Hershey, Clorox
FRIDAY 3 FEBRUARY
The City calendar is virtually bare, giving more space for speculation and conjecture post the central bank action 
earlier in the week and scrutiny of the new monthly macro data emerging.
Fresh after the Fed announcement comes the big US jobs market report, with the non-farm payrolls number that 
always has "all eyes" on it.
In December we saw 223k new jobs added, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% from 3.6% and average 
hourly earnings growth came in below expectations at 4.6% and the previous month's numbers were revised down 
to 4.8%.
"There continues to be a sense that the market is becoming complacent about how quickly we might see the 
Federal Reserve pivot when it comes to interest rates, however while the unemployment rate remains at multi year 
lows the US central bank has little incentive to cut rates when inflation still remains almost 3 times higher than its 
2% target," said market analyst Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.
January is expected to have seen 175k new jobs added, with the unemployment rate set to edge back up to 3.6%.

Ryanair has been warned about misleading carbon offset claims
Ryanair has been warned about misleading carbon offset claims

Ryanair has made their carbon offsetting claims clearer after an investigation by the Netherlands Authority for 
Consumers and Markets (ACM) warned that flying remains "highly polluting."
The consumer authority warned that statements like "Fly greener to..." and suggestions that offsetting emissions 
would lead to more sustainable flights were worded in an alarmingly misleading way.
"Businesses must be honest and clear about the sustainability claims they make. Even with CO2-compensation 
schemes, flying remains a highly polluting way of travelling," explains Edwin van Houten, director of ACM's 
Consumer Department.
"Airlines may offer CO2 compensation schemes, but they cannot give the impression that CO2 compensation will 
make flying sustainable."
Why is this warning for Ryanair significant?
ACM started looking into Ryanair as part of a wider investigation into carbon compensation claims across the Dutch 
aviation industry.
One of its main findings was that some of these claims may give passengers the false impression they would be 
flying significantly more sustainably with the low-cost carrier. That could mean they are attracted to flying with the 
company over other supposedly less sustainable airlines.
"ACM's announcement is quite significant," says Eric Stam, a lecturer at Rotterdam Airport College and member of 
campaign group Stay Grounded. Stam asked the ACM to intervene in the aviation industry's carbon offsetting 
claims two years ago.
"If more national consumer authorities scrutinize sustainability claims of airlines and coordinate with each other to 
denounce them, airlines and airports have to be more cautious in what they promise their customers and 
politicians."
What changes did Ryanair make to its website?
Ryanair has been warned about misleading carbon offset claims
Ryanair cooperated with the authority and has since made three changes to the CO2 compensation option on its 
online ticket sales.
A clear message that CO2 compensation does not make flying itself more sustainable was added. Messaging that 
suggested you could "Fly greener to [...]" was instead changed to "compensate your CO2 emissions". Symbols like 
green leaves were also removed.
The website now also shows how the estimated emissions for each ticket are calculated and the amount of CO2 
compensation. In addition, Ryanair had to clarify which projects the CO2 compensation fee was spent on, 
highlighting the independent certification of each one.
Why is carbon offsetting a problem?
Climate strategies for many airlines hinge on using carbon offsetting to reduce emissions.
Ryanair plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 24 per cent using offsetting programmes. Such schemes include 
the distribution of energy-efficient stoves in Uganda by First Climate.
But not all offset projects genuinely reduce emissions, warns Magdalena Heuwieser, a spokesperson for the Stay 
Grounded network.
"It would be necessary to investigate each of these offset projects, which would most likely unveil how most of them 
do not really lead to emissions reductions," she says.
"On top of that, it is hypocritical to pay people in Uganda to use energy efficient cooking stoves so that we can 
continue flying with a good conscience and airlines can continue to profit."
Others, such as EasyJet, have dropped offsetting schemes altogether to focus on directly cutting emissions 
through sustainable aviation fuel or hydrogen-powered engines.

Losses at low-cost airline Wizz Air have narrowed as ticket prices rise and demand for travel remains strong despite 
the economic slowdown. The UK-listed airline yesterday reported an operating loss of (EURO)155.5mn for the final 
three months of 2022, down from (EURO)213.6mn a year earlier.
Chief executive József Váradi said passengers were willing to pay higher prices for their seats, with average fares 
running above 2019 levels.
Revenue more than doubled compared with the previous year, from (EURO)408.4mn to (EURO)911.7mn, as the 
airline carried 12.4mn passengers, up 60 per cent.
Shares in the company fell 7 per cent yesterday despite the upbeat news, reversing gains the previous day, which 
followed EASYJET's bullish forecasts for the rest of the year.
Wizz Air's costs also rose significantly in the quarter, as it pushed ahead with an ambitious expansion plan that has 
seen it grow out of its eastern European origins to emerge as a leading player in European aviation. Total operating 
costs in the most recent quarter rose 72 per cent to (EURO)1.06bn, as a higher fuel bill also added to operating 
expenses.
Wizz Air said it expected to report a loss for its current financial year, which ends in March, but Váradi said he 
"remained confident" that the following year would be profitable.
Wizz Air losses narrow as ticket prices climb Airlines
The chief executive said booking volumes were ahead of 2022 figures while pricing had been strong, adding to 
positive commentary from rivals including EASYJET and Ryanair, which have both reported surging demand for 
travel despite the cost of living crisis.
Váradi added that there had been no signs of a slowdown in consumer spending in any of the 54 countries Wizz 
flew to and there was strong demand "across the board". "It seems people might be prepared to sacrifice on other 
consumer items ... other than travel," he said.
Analysts at Goodbody said the release from Wizz Air contained fewer positive surprises than EASYJET's and the 
quarterly loss was higher than forecast. They also drew attention to Wizz Air's unit costs, which even excluding fuel 
were still higher than before the pandemic.
Holiday airline Jet2 yesterday also added to the burst of positive commentary, saying bookings had strengthened. 
The group said it expected to beat market expectations and forecast an annual profit for the year ending in March of 
between £370mn and £385mn Jet2 said ticket prices were "significantly higher" than in the winter before the 
pandemic and that "customers' eagerness to take their much valued and anticipated holidays remains high".

Taking flight High demand puts EASYJET on path to profit
Taking flight High demand puts EASYJET on path to profit

EasyJet yesterday forecast a return to annual profit after three years of losses following "strong and sustained" 
demand as the travel industry weathers the economic slowdown.
Shares in the budget carrier surged 10 per cent to 513.4p yesterday, following the forecast as the airline said 
customers appeared to be "prioritising spending on holidays". It also reported three record-breaking weekends for 
sales revenue this month.
The airline plans to expand its flight schedules into the summer and to return to pre-pandemic flying levels by the 
peak summer months between July and September.
Johan Lundgren, chief executive, said people were prioritising destinations that offered value for money, including 
Turkey and Egypt. He said this pent-up demand would put the airline "firmly on the path to delivering a full-year 
profit".
The jump in easyJet's shares took gains this year to more than 50 per cent as investors welcomed growing signs 
that demand for travel was withstanding economic uncertainty.
Other airlines also enjoyed rises in shares, with low-cost rival Wizz Air's stock increasing 7 per cent, while British 
Airways' owner International Airlines Group gained 3 per cent and Ryanair climbed 2 per cent.
The forecasts for a strong summer came as easyJet reported a pre-tax loss of £133mn for the final three months of 
the year, down from £213mn lost the previous year.
Taking flight High demand puts EASYJET on path to profit
EasyJet flew 20.2mn seats in the quarter, up from 15.5mn seats a year earlier. Revenue rose 83 per cent to 
£1.47bn. Philip Georgiadis

easyJet (London Luton) is returning to London Southend Airport over the 2023 IATA northern summer, offering 
flights from the airport to Faro, Malaga, Palma de Mallorca (Majorca), and Amsterdam Schiphol. While easyJet flew 
to Faro, Malaga and Majorca from Southend last summer, it last flew the Amsterdam route in March 2020.
In 2019, London Southend Airport was serving around two million passengers annually with easyJet, Ryanair UK, 
and Wizz Air UK flying direct to around 50 European airports. In 2021, Wizz Air and Ryanair ended Southend 
services and last year, easyJet, which formerly had a substantial presence at the airport, only offered a combined 
12 roundtrip flights a week to Faro, Malaga and Majorca over the summer before pausing flights again.
However, London Southend has secured a new multi-year agreement with easyJet that will see it increase its flight 
frequencies at the airport by 30% this summer and restore the Amsterdam service. The airline returns to Southend 
on March 29 to resume flights to Malaga, which will operate up to four times a week through to October 28. On May 
1, summer flights to Majorca restart, operating up to five times a week through to October 28. Between May 24 and 
October 27, easyJet will operate up to four roundtrips a week on both the Southend - Faro and Southend - 
Amsterdam sectors.
"This announcement illustrates our commitment to rebuilding our fantastic airport for the future," said Southend's 
CEO, John Upton, via a media statement. "We remain committed to strengthening our unrivalled short-haul 
network," added Ali Gayward, easyJet's UK country manager.
On January 23, Southend Airport said the previous week was its busiest since June 2021, with 1,148 aircraft 
movements. The airport, which is now owned by Esken Limited (formerly Stobart Group Limited), was the UK's third 
busiest in the 1960s but last year only recorded 5% of its 2019 passenger numbers. In addition to the passenger 
airlines scaling back their operations and closing bases at the airport, Amazon also ended its nighttime cargo flights 
to the airport last September.
However, easyJet's agreement with London Southend Airport will see it gradually scale up flights from the airport 
over the next few years. The airline says the airport has "an attractive and growing catchment area" and that it will 
pursue cost-effective operations and proven routes.

EasyJet Sees Return To Profit, Strong Bookings For 2023
EasyJet Sees Return To Profit, Strong Bookings For 2023

Jan 25, 2023( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 EasyJet (EZJ.L) on Wednesday said it expected to beat current market expectations for 2023 based on the 
strength of bookings into summer and was set to deliver a return to full-year profit as the sector recovers from 
pandemic restrictions. 
Analysts have said airlines can expect a strong booking season as many hope that despite a recession in Britain, 
travellers won't sacrifice their holidays. Low-cost airlines in particular are set to benefit as consumers have less 
money to spend amidst double-digit inflation.  
"Whilst we remain mindful of the uncertain macroeconomic outlook across the globe, based on current high levels 
of demand and strong bookings, easyJet anticipates beating the current market profit expectations for full-year 
2023," the company said in a statement.  
The British airline reported a headline loss before tax of 133 million pounds ($163.9 million) for the quarter to end-
December, and said it expected its loss before tax for the first half to be significantly better than in the first half of 
2022. 
EasyJet Holidays also upgraded expectations from 30% customer growth to around 50% year-on-year and said the 
airline had almost 50% more customers than last year.  
"This strong booking performance, aided by the airline's step changed revenue capability, has driven an 80 million 
pound year-on-year boost in the first quarter with continued momentum as customers prioritise spending on 
holidays for the year ahead," Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said in a statement.  
Shares in easyJet, which made a loss before tax of 178 million pounds in its last year, rose 10% to a seven-month 
high of 516 pence, although still well below the pre-pandemic level of around 1,300 pence. 
Analysts had expected it to make a pretax profit of 126 million pounds this year, according to a company-supplied 
consensus. 
WizzAir was up 7.8% while IAG rose by 2.8%.  
Lundgren said easyJet saw record-breaking sales revenue in recent weekends as customers booked holidays in 
places like the Greek islands and Spain. 
Staff recruitment for the busy summer season was also well on its way, he told reporters, in a bid to prevent the 
disruption that marred the European travel sector last summer.  
EasyJet Sees Return To Profit, Strong Bookings For 2023
"We have recruited almost all of the need we have for the summer programme but we will make sure we will have 
further resilience in our crew," he said on a call.  
Ryanair (RYA.I), Europe's biggest airline and a low-cost competitor for easyJet, said earlier this month it was 
expecting a very strong summer season with a reasonable prospect of average European short-haul air fares rising 
by a high single digit percentage.  
"Airline reporting season starts optimistically, and we expect easyJet to be the first of several strong prints. Earlier 
guidance looks overly cautious and numbers will need to come up," Bernstein analyst Alex Irving said in a research 
note.

Eurostar trains running a third empty because of post-Brexit passport delays
Eurostar trains running a third empty because of post-Brexit passport 
delays

Eurostar is being forced to run trains more than a third empty during its morning peak because of delays caused by 
post-Brexit border arrangements, the rail service's new chief executive has revealed.
Gwendoline Cazenave told the Financial Times that demand had rebounded strongly from the pandemic but 
stations in London, Paris and Brussels could not handle more passengers owing to strict passport checks 
introduced in 2021.
"Customers [came] back overnight, but the system does not work anymore," said Cazenave, a former senior 
executive in the French state railway who took over at Eurostar in October.
The first trains leaving London and Paris every morning carry a maximum of 550 passengers in their 894 seats to 
prevent bottlenecks at a time when several trains are leaving in quick succession to different destinations.
"If I uncapped it, we would sell all of the seats," Cazenave said.
The service regularly runs 14 daily trains between Paris and London compared with 18 or more in 2019. Eurostar 
has operated more trains during very busy periods but said that there are not enough border resources to return 
permanently to pre-pandemic schedules.
Eurostar trains running a third empty because of post-Brexit passport delays
Eurostar has added more staff and an extra French passport control booth has been installed in London. But the 
number of people who can flow through the border is constrained by the tight space of the international terminals at 
its stations.
Despite these problems, Cazenave said passenger numbers returned to about 80 per cent of their pre-pandemic 
levels by the second half of last year.
While the service struggles with constraints, airlines are capitalising on demand. Europe's largest carrier Ryanair 
plans to run a record number of flights this summer. "We cannot talk about growth if we are not able to cross the 
border in the right way. It should be solved, it has to be," she said.
Cazenave is confident of finding solutions, including persuading border authorities to add more staff.
"We will find a way because everyone is very motivated, and is aware of the key role Eurostar plays in the mobility 
between the UK and mainland Europe."
She added that business travellers were increasingly willing to swap shorthaul flights for trains, dispelling the idea 
that rail journeys must be three hours or less to compete with planes.

Target prices for British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG), easyJet PLC and 
other airlines were upped by Deutsche Bank on Tuesday ahead of coming results updates.
Shares in the European carriers have risen by an average of 20% since mid-December, when analyst Jaime 
Rowbotham provided his previous outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022.
This is pricing in "what is clearly going to be a much better year than we had previously envisaged", he said.
Forecasts from Deutsche have now been updated to reflect the superior operating environment, with target prices 
lifted to reflect this.
For IAG the target price was lifted to 180p from 155p, with the recommendation kept at 'hold'. For easyJet, rated 
'sell' by the bank, the target was hiked to 410p from 330pp
Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ), another on a 'hold' rating, saw its target price moved to 3150p from 2550p, 
while the target for Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) was lifted to (EURO)17.50 from (EURO)16.00 and its rating 
reiterated at 'buy'.
The forecasts and prices are based on the assumption that the strong pricing environment that was in evidence in 
the September quarter of 2022 persists throughout the end of last year and the first half of 2023.
Airline share targets hiked as pricing will be 'much stronger' than forecast - analyst
Network airline yields were at least 20% above pre-crisis and low-cost-carriers' yields more than 10% above, the 
analyst noted.
For the second half of 2023, he assumed ticket yields are flat year-on-year for the low-cost airlines and down 5% for 
the networks.
Of the other networks, Air France-KLM (OTC:AFLYY) and Deutsche Lufthansa AG are both rated 'hold'.

British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) and easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) have 
been given higher share targets and tipped as 'buys' over the potential for further growth headroom.
Airlines are still "in the early stages of recovery from the pandemic", said Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo in a note on 
Tuesday.
He cited positive factors for the sector being "relatively careful" plans from companies to grow capacity, moderating 
and stabilising jet fuel prices and "encouraging" recent commentary about forward bookings.
However, he conceded that some macroeconomic indicators are deteriorating, including "horrific" consumer 
confidence, falling GDP forecasts and worsening PMIs.
"We see headroom for the demand/supply balance to remain favourable with capacity mostly still below 2019 
levels," he said.
Budget airline easyJet is seen as offering the best risk/reward balance at the sector's current share price levels, 
with upside from its Holidays arm, seasonal pilot contracts and aircraft redeployment all "underappreciated".
The analyst raised his target price for easyJet to 500p from 430p (last close 450p), while for IAG it was raised to 
220p from 145p (last close was 162.38p)
BA -owner IAG and easyJet offer more upside as airline recovery 'still in early stages'
IAG's valuation "appears consistent with mid- or even latecycle earnings, despite the industry being in only the early 
stages of recovery", said Khoo.
Macro risks are "more than priced in" at the shares current levels, with the FTSE 100-listed group's positioning 
based on the leading hub airports for transatlantic traffic, extensive route networks and attractive origin and 
destination flows all "remain intact".
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) was also reiterated at 'buy', but its shares are seen as offering "less re-rating 
potential".

RYANAIR yesterday claimed a £140m deal with a Boeing subsidiary will help it make huge cuts to fuel consumption 
and carbon emissions.
Some 400 aircraft will be retrofitted with Aviation Partners Boeing's 'winglets'.
Also known as wingtip devices, winglets are vertical extensions attached to a plane's wings used to improve fuel 
efficiency as they reduce the aircraft's aerodynamic drag when it moves through the air.
Thomas Fowler, director of sustainability at Ryanair, said: "As Europe's most environmentally efficient major airline, 
we are leading the way in sustainable aviation as demonstrated by this investment in our fleet."
Last month the airline agreed to buy around 360,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) from Shell 
between 2025 and 2030 as part of a sector-wide push to become greener in sharp order.
Derived from the likes of solid waste and food scraps, SAFs are considered the main way towards net-zero as they 
produce 80 per cent fewer emissions than normal fuel.

 Greek police on Sunday said they had found no explosives on board a Ryanair flight from Poland, following an 
earlier bomb threat. 
A search of the passengers and the aircraft 'did not find anything suspicious,' the police said in a statement. 
The Boeing 737 flight from Katowice with 190 people on board had landed in Athens with an escort of two F-16 jets, 
after earlier being shadowed by Hungarian warplanes, Greek officials said. 
Piotr Adamczyk, public relations manager at Katowice airport, said they had received a telephone warning as the 
plane was flying over Slovakia. 
'After the plane took off, there was a call to the airport information centre concerning the possible presence of an 
explosive device on board,' Adamczyk told AFP. 
The flight had landed at an isolated area at Athens International Airport shortly before 1600 GMT, a delay of nearly 
two-and-a-half hours. 
It had earlier been diverted to fly over the sea as it approached Athens as a precaution. 
'Crew onboard flight FR6385 travelling from Katowice to Athens were notified of a potential security threat onboard 
and in line with safety procedures, continued to Athens where it landed safely before being met by the Greek 
authorities,' Ryanair said in a statement. 
'Passengers disembarked normally,' it added.

Little Room For Gloom At Dublin's Davos For Aircraft Financiers
Little Room For Gloom At Dublin's Davos For Aircraft Financiers

Jan 20, 2023( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 While the prospect of global recession casts a long shadow over the snowy peaks of Davos this week, the mood 
was mostly sunnier at another gathering of executives - the owners of most of the world's planes - 1,700 kilometres 
away in Dublin. 
The world's top aircraft lessors - a bellwether for the wider economy - lined up to predict a bumper 2023, buoyed by 
China's earlier than expected lifting of travel curbs and a belief consumers would continue to prioritise travel amid a 
cost of living crunch.  
"Our industry is still climbing out of - call it a 100-year event, call it a macro shock of epic proportions. So a normal 
recession looks pretty good compared to our entire customer base grounded for two years," said Andy Cronin, chief 
executive of the world's third largest lessor, Avolon. 
"We are bullish and these are the reasons why I suspect there's a disconnect between the Davos in Switzerland 
and the Davos in Dublin," Cronin told Reuters. 
Cronin was one of many executives in Dublin confident that "revenge travel" - the idea that after years of lockdowns 
people are determined to holiday - would continue to drive demand and airfares up this year. 
Aengus Kelly, chief executive of No.1 lessor AerCap, added on stage that consumers had bought as many flat 
screen TVs, Xboxes and Peloton bikes as they need. 
Airlines are continuing to see surging demand with Ryanair, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, reporting two 
weeks of record bookings this month and predicting a high single digit percentage rise in air fares this summer.  
Cronin, whose firm owns or manages almost 600 aircraft, said airlines were now much more nimble if they did need 
to reduce capacity in response to any pockets of weakening demand after many restructured their cost base during 
the COVID-19 crisis. 
The recovery has also allowed lessors to push up lease rates on the more than half of the world's airline fleet they 
control, while many executives acknowledged that inflation is also kind to owners of hard assets, so long as it does 
not get out of control and lead to wider economic problems. 
However, China's reawakening was the source of most optimism, given 40% of Asian traffic typically originates or 
arrives there, according to Cronin.  
"It's a good time to be a lessor," said Tony Diaz, chairman of the smaller Zephyrus Aviation Capital. 
THE IRISH GRANNY 
Little Room For Gloom At Dublin's Davos For Aircraft Financiers
A small number of executives were more circumspect. David Houlihan, president of top 10 lessor Dubai Aerospace 
Enterprise (DAE), said the previously travel shy "Irish granny" could be the industry's "canary in the coal mine." 
"Nowadays, the Irish granny is flying everywhere," Houlihan told the Airline Economics conference. "For me, when 
Irish grannies stop travelling, that means there's something wrong in the market place."  
Ryan McKenna of U.S. based Griffin Global Asset Management, perhaps the most pessimistic CEO to speak over 
the three days, doubted the post-COVID enthusiasm to travel could continue unabated and said this would 
ultimately result in some reduction in "ultra high" fares and passenger demand in Western markets.  
"It's easy to take that first vacation because you haven't had one in two years. It's probably easy to take that second 
one too," Robert Korn, president and co-founder of fast growing Carlyle Aviation Partners, added. 
"But as families start to get to the third, fourth, fifth one, and we're all facing inflationary times, I think there's really a 
strong question how long any of this demand will hold."

Thousands of Swissport airport ground staff have accepted a pay rise, ending industrial disputes that threatened 
disruption at some of the UK's largest airports.
Workers voted 61% in favour of a 10% pay increase, the highest ever offered by Swissport according to the GMB 
union.
National officer Matt Roberts said: "Bosses in the aviation sector must now continue to rebuild; investing big in our 
aviation workers.
"By negotiating with GMB to value and retain workers, there is a chance for employers to avoid a repeat of chaos 
for holidaymakers this summer."
Swissport operates at the UK's busiest airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester, with some 66,000 
staff responsible for baggage and cargo handling, as well as checking passengers in.
Following a surge in demand last year, airports struggled to cope with passenger higher numbers, mainly due to 
staff shortages caused by cuts made during the pandemic.
Strikes by Border Force workers have also led to disruption, with previous action taking place over the Christmas 
period.
PCS union head Mark Serwotka suggested in late December that these strikes could continue well into the new 
year unless a pay deal is made with the government soon.

ITA- Lufthansa Deal Sparks Further Airline Merger Talk
ITA-Lufthansa Deal Sparks Further Airline Merger Talk

 German airline Lufthansa's bid for a minority stake in Italy's ITA Airways has ignited talk of further potential sector 
consolidation as the industry seeks to plot a more profitable post-pandemic recovery. 
Many of Europe's legacy flag-carrying airlines are struggling to compete effectively with budget carriers, hampered 
by weak balance sheets that could be made more robust by merging with rivals, analysts said. 
Lufthansa has offered to buy an initial minority stake in ITA, Italy's state-owned successor to Alitalia, it said on 
Wednesday. 
"This may be the next step in European airline consolidation," said Bernstein analyst Alex Irving, citing Portugal's 
national airline, TAP, as a prime target. 
The Portuguese government, which owns TAP, has said it is considering an outright or partial sale of the business. 
Lufthansa, Air-France KLM and British Airways owner IAG are potential buyers, analysts said. 
"We clearly focus on ITA," a Lufthansa spokesperson said. "At the same time, however, we closely monitor 
consolidation in the European airline market." 
Air-France KLM and IAG declined to comment. 
Sweden's SAS, which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States since last summer, is 
also a potential candidate, Kepler Cheuvreux airlines analyst Ruxandra Haradau-Doeser and Bernstein's Irving 
said. 
An SAS spokesperson said it's "too early in the process to comment on any potential future investors".  
British budget carrier easyJet is another possible target, said Haradau-Doeser.  
"For Lufthansa, the logic of taking over easyJet would be great - it could strengthen its market position in Great 
Britain, Paris-Orly and Geneva," she said.  
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken CEO of fellow low-cost airline Ryanair, also weighed in with his predictions this 
week. 
"TAP will finish up in BA-IAG, then I think easyJet is going to finish up being bought by either BA or Air France or 
both jointly and then Lufthansa will buy Wizz," he said. 
CAUTION AND PATIENCE 
Some aviation executives, however, said airlines would be wary of taking on risk in what is still a tough operating 
environment. 
ITA- Lufthansa Deal Sparks Further Airline Merger Talk
EasyJet downplayed talk of consolidation.  
"It's very difficult to really make it work well in Europe. These type of deals are very complicated and distracting," 
easyJet Strategy Director Shane Lord said at the Air Finance Journal conference in Dublin. 
While some analysts have been quick to speculate on potential mergers, there are other ways airlines could 
strengthen their finances. 
"For healthier yields and margins, European airlines need to find capacity discipline: this is something that has been 
lacking in the past," Bernstein's Irving said. 
And the big buyers, including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, have not demonstrated any real appetite for 
acquisitions. 
"Right now our priority is to fully recover from the COVID crisis and to complete our transformation," an Air-France 
KLM spokesperson said in an emailed response to a request for comment.  
German business daily Handelsblatt has reported that Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr mentioned at an internal 
company event that TAP could be an option for more long-haul business with South America.  
However, it could take months before the ITA Airways-Lufthansa deal is finalised, making it unlikely that Lufthansa 
will move ahead with further deals any time soon, a company source said.

Aviation Leaders Hail Green Fuel As Carbon Saviour, But Wonder Who Will Pay
Aviation Leaders Hail Green Fuel As Carbon Saviour, But Wonder Who Will 
Pay

 Greener fuel is the only way airlines will meet strict global carbon emission targets, executives meeting in Dublin 
this week agreed, but there's little consensus on who should foot the hefty bill to ramp up production. 
 Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which uses feedstocks like cooking oils to reduce emissions by up to 80% from 
conventional fuel, is seen as the carbon saviour for an aviation sector often cast as a villain in the fight against 
climate change. 
 But the nascent industry makes up less than 1% of fuel used and costs between three to five times more than 
traditional jet fuel. 
That has stirred a debate whether governments, airlines or oil producers - or a combination of all three - should fund 
the expansion of production required to hit a proposed European Union target of 20% by 2035. 
Aengus Kelly, chief executive of lease giant AerCap, said SAF was the only option, but cited an estimate that the 
transition could require investment of $1.5 trillion over 30 years. 
"That's an extraordinary cost," he told the Airline Economics conference, one of a pair of annual events that bring 
together the world's largest aircraft owners. 
"Government won't do it all. That's not going to happen." 
 Willie Walsh, head of airline industry body IATA, told the conference airlines shouldn't expect traditional oil 
producers to meet the industry's needs. 
"There has to be greater sharing of the burden to ensure that the industry, everybody can make it to net zero," he 
said. 
 Consumers aren't willing to fork out either, with many airlines saying less than 5% of customers fund carbon offsets 
or SAF surcharges they offer. 
Many complain that action is pointless until huge emerging market emitters like China and India agree to play their 
part, one executive said. 
 SPEEDING UP 
 Some airlines called on the EU to do more to catch up with the United States, where the Inflation Reduction Act is 
spurring spending. 
Aviation Leaders Hail Green Fuel As Carbon Saviour, But Wonder Who Will Pay
 British Airways owner IAG made its first major investments in SAF in the United States, including a commitment to 
buy 220,000 tonnes from a Mississippi biorefinery in 2021, because U.S. policy is "much more joined up," said 
Leigh Hudson, IAG's sustainable fuels and carbon manager. 
With the right policy support, 30 SAF plants could be built across Europe over the next eight years, she said in an 
emailed statement. 
 Ryanair in December agreed to buy its SAF from Shell in an early step towards its target of powering 12.5% of 
flights with the fuel by 2030. 
While it is too soon to say how realistic the 2030 targets are, reaching 2% by 2026 was a vital first step, its director 
of sustainability Thomas Fowler said. 
"If they get the first 2% over the line, then we'll have a good sense," he told Reuters.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said yesterday that there were "no signs" of an economic slowdown hitting airlines, 
after the carrier racked up record bookings at the start of the year.
Passengers were paying up for higher fares as demand withstood slowing economic growth and a squeeze in the 
cost of living in the UK and the Continent.
"All the indicators are very strong," O'Leary said, pointing to "a lot of spending. Hotels are full, restaurants are full." 
Ryanair reported 4.95mn bookings last week, the most in its history. "There is an outside prospect this week we 
might do 5mn for the first time."No big airline had reported a significant slowdown in demand despite the grim 
economic backdrop, a resilience O'Leary put down to pent-up demand after pandemic border restrictions, high 
savings, and still-low unemployment.
Avolon, the second-largest jet leasing company, this week projected that air traffic would recover to pre-pandemic 
levels by the middle of this year, propelled by China's reopening.
Ryanair is back above its 2019 schedules, but O'Leary warned that the recovery was vulnerable to a sudden 
collapse in demand, potentially because of an escalation of the Ukraine war or a pandemic flare-up. "There is 
undoubtedly strength in bookings and pricing at the moment. And if that continues through into Easter and the peak 
summer travel without any "black swan" event, then I think we could see all the airlines do very well in Europe this 
year." Ryanair expects to carry a record 168mn passengers in the 12 months to the end of March, up from 149mn 
in its busiest year before the coronavirus crisis.
Ryanair has best bookings week in its history Airlines
Earlier this month the airline upgraded its earnings forecasts to profit after tax of between (EURO)1.33bn and 
(EURO)1.423bn, up from a previous guide range of between (EURO)1bn and (EURO)1.2bn.
O'Leary cautioned that profitability could be squeezed over the next 12 months as the airline would be more 
exposed to the volatile price of oil when some of its fuel hedges expire in April. But for now, passengers appeared 
willing to soak up much of these price rises through higher fares. "We are waiting to see what could go wrong, 
because everything is steaming ahead," he added.

Earlier this month the airline upgraded its earnings forecasts to profit after tax of between (EURO)1.33bn and 
(EURO)1.423bn, up from a previous guide range of between (EURO)1bn and (EURO)1.2bn.
O'Leary cautioned that profitability could be squeezed over the next 12 months as the airline would be more 
exposed to the volatile price of oil when some of its fuel hedges expire in April. But for now, passengers appeared 
willing to soak up much of these price rises through higher fares. "We are waiting to see what could go wrong, 
because everything is steaming ahead," he added.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said yesterday that there were "no signs" of an economic slowdown hitting airlines, 
after the carrier racked up record bookings at the start of the year.
Passengers were paying up for higher fares as demand withstood slowing economic growth and a squeeze in the 
cost of living in the UK and the Continent.
"All the indicators are very strong," O'Leary said, pointing to "a lot of spending. Hotels are full, restaurants are full." 
Ryanair reported 4.95mn bookings last week, the most in its history. "There is an outside prospect this week we 
might do 5mn for the first time."No big airline had reported a significant slowdown in demand despite the grim 
economic backdrop, a resilience O'Leary put down to pent-up demand after pandemic border restrictions, high 
savings, and still-low unemployment.
Avolon, the second-largest jet leasing company, this week projected that air traffic would recover to pre-pandemic 
levels by the middle of this year, propelled by China's reopening.
Ryanair is back above its 2019 schedules, but O'Leary warned that the recovery was vulnerable to a sudden 
collapse in demand, potentially because of an escalation of the Ukraine war or a pandemic flare-up. "There is 
undoubtedly strength in bookings and pricing at the moment. And if that continues through into Easter and the peak 
summer travel without any "black swan" event, then I think we could see all the airlines do very well in Europe this 
year." Ryanair expects to carry a record 168mn passengers in the 12 months to the end of March, up from 149mn 
in its busiest year before the coronavirus crisis.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) boss Michael O'Leary has tipped rivals British Airways and Air France as 
possible bidders for easyJet as he predicted a wave of consolidation in the airline business.
Speaking at a press conference in London, O'Leary said that Covid had accelerated the consolidation process in 
the airline sector with Luton-based easyJet "going to finish up being bought by either British Airways or Air France, 
or both jointly."
British Airway owner IAG and easyJet takeover rumour gets warm reception
Share prices in the airline sector have raced away in the first few weeks of 2023 on hopes of a return to pre-
pandemic levels of travel and O'Leary revealed the Irish carrier had just smashed its weekend bookings record.
Ryanair saw 2.03mln flight bookings over the weekend compared with the previous record of 1.6mln in early 2019 
during a massive cut-price sale.
"People are getting in early and booking their Easter and summer travel," he said. "There just seems to be very 
strong demand out there."
"People are worrying that prices are going to rise in the summer - which I think they will," O'Leary added, saying he 
expects average fares to rise by "the high single digits" year-on-year.
Shares in Ryanair were flat at (EURO)13.14, British Airways owner IAG was down by 1% at 157.4p, and easyJet 
was off 1.1% at 437p in Tuesday late afternoon trading.

Jan 17, 2023( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Low-cost carrier Ryanair is not seeing any signs of recession, Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said on 
Tuesday, pointing to two weeks of record bookings this January and a recovery in demand from Britain. 
January blues helped drive holiday bookings, O'Leary told reporters in London, noting that his airline, Europe's 
largest airline by passenger numbers, took more than 2 million bookings last weekend, its most ever in a two-day 
period.  
Referring to talk of a looming recession in Britain and a slowdown elsewhere in Europe, O'Leary said: "We see no 
signs of it at the moment." 
The strongest market for those bookings was for flights from Britain to European destinations, such as Spain and 
Portugal over Easter and summer, he said, in a reversal from earlier in January when the airline flagged softer 
demand from the UK.  
"There just seems to be very strong demand out there and people, I think, worrying that prices are going to rise in 
summer, which I think they will, and people getting in early and booking their Easter and summer travel," he said.  
The airline is expecting a very strong summer season, betting that average European short-haul air fares will jump 
by a high single-digit percentage. 
Appetite for holidays is resilient despite the economic slowdown from high inflation because people no longer see 
holidays as a luxury, said O'Leary. He said Ryanair's customers "scrimp and save" elsewhere to protect their travel 
plans. 
Air fares will keep rising, O'Leary predicted, because capacity within the European air travel market remains 
constrained.  
While Ryanair is flying more than it did before the pandemic, competitor airlines such as easyJet, British Airways 
and Lufthansa are still tracking behind where they were in 2019.  
O'Leary said the shift to a higher interest rate environment gives Ryanair an advantage over competitors because it 
owns most of its planes. EasyJet and Wizz Air lease more of their fleets, pushing up their costs. 
Looking into the future, O'Leary repeated his forecast that Europe's airline industry is set for further consolidation in 
the coming years.  
Ryanair CEO O'Leary Sees No Sign Of Recession
"Alitalia's clearly going to finish up with probably Lufthansa in the next three or four months. TAP I think will finish up 
in BA-IAG, then I think easyJet is going to finish up being bought by either BA or Air France or both jointly and then 
Lufthansa will buy Wizz," he said.

Ryanair in record bookings as consumers plan Easter and summer trips

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday announced record bookings driven by UK consumers planning 
foreign trips for Easter and summer.
Ryanair is a low-cost airline based in Swords in County Dublin, Republic of Ireland.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the airline received 2.0 million flight bookings last weekend, beating the 
carrier's previous record weekend of 1.6 million in early 2019 when seats were heavily discounted.
O'Leary told reporters at a press conference in the City of London: "Yes, there's lots of cheap seats out there, but 
it's not on the back of a seat sale. There just seems to be very strong demand out there."
"People are worrying that prices are going to rise in the summer – which I think they will. People are getting in early 
and booking their Easter and summer travel."
O'Leary said he expects average fares to rise this year by "the high single digits" in percentage terms compared 
with 2022, while he does not believe fares as low as GBP9.99 will return "for the next year or two" due to high oil 
prices.
He attributed the strong booking performance, despite the cost-of-living crisis, to people deciding to "scrimp and 
save" elsewhere to "protect their holiday".
"One of the things that has emerged out of Covid is the annual holiday, or the second holiday, or the week in the 
sun, is no longer being considered by many to be a luxury that we can drop," he said.
O'Leary added that the pandemic has "accelerated the consolidation process" in the airline sector.
He believes that eventually easyJet "is going to finish up being bought by either British Airways or Air France, or 
both jointly".
Ryanair in record bookings as consumers plan Easter and summer trips
Earlier this month, Ryanair increased its profit forecast, as a strong Christmas season meant the airline now 
expects profit after tax to reach between a little over EUR1.3 billion and EUR1.4 billion, or GBP1.1 billion and 
GBP1.2 billion during the financial year ending March 31.
That is an increase from the EUR1 billion to EUR1.2 billion range, or GBP880 million to GBP1.06 billion, that the 
company had previously supplied to shareholders.
Ryanair shares were 0.5% lower at EUR14.73 each on Tuesday afternoon in Dublin.

Airlines are heading for some decent upgrades after strong traffic numbers in the last three months of 2022, 
according to analysts at JPMorgan.
Shares in the sector have already risen by 48% in the past three months on the basis of a resurgence in air travel, 
but the US bank's analysts still see potential for more to come due to structural issues such as a lack of planes.
Across the sector, the analysts have on average raised their EBIT earnings forecasts by 12% for full-year 2022 and 
by 5% for full-year 2023.
"Despite carriers aiming to grow capacity materially year-on-year, the unavailability of aircraft and continuing pent-
up demand could offer a more supportive pricing environment than most would have expected a few months ago," 
they said in a note to clients.
On specific airlines, the JPMorgan analysts said British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA 
(LSE:IAG) (IAG) is a 'hold', though on "positive catalyst watch". Ryanair PLC and Wizz Air PLC are rated 
'overweight', with easyJet PLC still the ugly duckling at 'underweight'.
Shares in IAG rose by 0.9% to 158.7p on Monday, while Wizz Air was up 0.4% to 2,862p, and easyJet added 2.5% 
to 442p.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has confirmed it will not re-open its Brussels National base in summer 2023, blaming the 
airport's 11% hike in airline and passenger fees being implemented in April 2023.
"Unlike many other European Union airports who are lowering prices to recover traffic lost during the Covid 
pandemic or freezing charges to stimulate passenger growth, Brussels Zaventem has chosen to jack up prices yet 
again by 11% for airlines and passengers from April 2023, making it even more uncompetitive compared to other 
Belgian and EU airports," the airline said in a statement. The base was already closed during the winter season.
Ryanair confirmed it would still operate 12 routes to/from Brussels Zaventem during the summer on aircraft based 
outside of Belgium. Its flights from Brussels Charleroi would be unaffected. Ryanair expects to operate 109 routes 
to/from Brussels Charleroi in the summer season.
"As a statement for the closure, the management refers to the fact that it could not come to an agreement with 
Brussels Airport on lower rates," commented Hans Elsen, secretary of trade union ACV Puls, in a statement. 
"Those tariffs at Charleroi are unrealistically low right now. Ryanair is taking advantage of those cheap fares at 
secondary airports to profit. This is at the expense of staff and support services at airports."
The base closure reportedly put 59 jobs at risk, Elsen told Belga News Agency. On social media, Elsen pointed out 
that Charleroi was Ryanair's second most profitable airport after Dublin Int'l in 2019/20. "Ryanair had a profit margin 
of 27.6% at Charleroi in 2019-2020. They made over EUR100 million profit there alone. More than 1/10 of their 
profit figure. All this at the expense of the taxpayer (passenger tax that is nine times lower than Brussels 
Zaventem), staff and climate. Good job, government!"

Ryanair CEO Sees High Single Digit Air Fare Rise In 'Very Strong' Summer
Ryanair CEO Sees High Single Digit Air Fare Rise In 'Very Strong' Summer

Jan 12, 2023( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair is expecting a very strong summer season with a reasonable prospect of average European short-haul air 
fares rising by a high single digit percentage, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters on Thursday. 
Ryanair hiked its profit forecast for the year to end-March earlier in January after a strong Christmas season, 
meaning it is set to easily top the 1 billion euro ($1.08 billion) annual profit it made before two years of COVID-19 
losses. 
"The outlook for the summer at the moment is very strong, strong booking, strong pricing," the CEO of Europe's 
largest airline by passenger numbers said in an interview after announcing new routes from Italy. 
O'Leary said bookings over the first weeks of 2023 were strong as well as for the February mid-term and Easter 
holidays, although pricing for the first three months of the year will be a "little bit softer" than pre-COVID levels 
before picking up. 
"I think there is a reasonable prospect that this summer again we will see high-single digit price increases, certainly 
for short-haul European air travel," he said, despite risks from new variants of the coronavirus and adverse 
developments in Ukraine. 
Ryanair's summer plans will also be boosted by hopes that by the end of May it will receive 40 to 45 of 51 Boeing 
737 MAX aircraft due for delivery, O'Leary told Reuters. 
He had previously said the airline would be lucky to get 40 by June. 
BORDERS OPENING 
Asked about the impact of China's border reopening on the European aviation and tourism markets, he said it was 
"uncertain", noting a speedy recovery in Chinese travel would be good for bookings and fares but could also drive 
up oil prices. 
He said high post-COVID demand was unlikely to weaken in the coming weeks. 
"What is definitely happening this summer is we've got a very strong number of American visitors to Europe, 
because of a strong dollar and a weak euro, and you see the beginnings of a recovery of Asian traffic coming to 
Europe," he said. 
He added Ryanair's growth in the next 5 years would mostly be in central and eastern European economies, like 
Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, where incomes are rising and people are increasingly willing to travel. 
Ryanair CEO Sees High Single Digit Air Fare Rise In 'Very Strong' Summer
O'Leary sees no repeat of last summer's staff shortages at airports and airlines, but he was still worried about air 
traffic control, especially in Germany and France. 
"We don't worry too much about recession or consumer spending because that would drive more and more people 
to low cost airlines like Ryanair," he added.

SUMMER 2023 could spell additional trouble for the UK travel industry, with over half of rail and airline operators 
worrying about future staffing shortages - and almost 40 per cent blaming Brexit.
Data published yesterday by software company SAP shows that 55 per cent of industry decision makers believe 
staffing challenges will impact customers' travel plans this year, with 34 per cent saying issues will peak in the 
summer months.
It comes after the UK aviation industry was plagued by severe delays over the summer due to a boom in travel 
demand combined with staff shortages.
Airlines and airport executives blamed each other for the chaos, with each side arguing the other didn't hire enough 
staff to cater to the post-pandemic surge of air travel.
Yesterday's figures confirmed the trend, with 40 per cent of senior executives agreeing that the issues were caused 
by "an inability to forecast supply and demand".
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary called on the government in July to implement post-Brexit immigration rules with 
"more common sense".
The chief executive said it was easier for the low-cost carriers to recruit extra-EU nationals to work in Britain than to 
get visas for "Portuguese or Italian youngsters".
Warnings of summer of discontent 2.0 as rail and airline operators forecast further staff shortages
To address labour shortfalls, around 35 per cent of respondents believe they will have to sacrifice their 
environmental, social and governance targets in favour of staffing.

Ryanair to shutter Brussels Zaventem base

Highlight: Irish ultra-low-cost carrier Ryanair has decided not to reopen its Brussels Zaventem base over the 
airport's move to raise prices.
Body
The airport is set to increase prices by 11% from April this year. According to the Irish carrier, this decision by 
Zaventem Airport could make it more uncompetitive than other Belgian and European Union (EU) airports. It added 
that many EU airports are reducing the prices or freezing charges to help air traffic recover from the impact of the 
Covid-19 pandemic. 
However, Ryanair said that it will continue to operate 12 routes to/from Brussels Zaventem on aircraft based outside 
Belgium. The airline noted that its flights to/from Charleroi will not be impacted by the decision to shut its Zaventem 
base. It expects to operate 109 routes to/from Brussels Charleroi. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said: "Despite 
recent rumours, we will not be re-opening our Brussels Zaventem base in S23 due to Zaventem Airport's decision 
to increase prices by 11% for airlines and passengers from April 2023. "However, customers can still book 
Ryanair's low fares on 12 Zaventem routes that will continue to operate to/from Brussels Zaventem for S23 on 
aircraft based outside Belgium. "Ryanair's flights on 109 routes to/from Charleroi will be unaffected by this decision 
and we look forward to welcoming millions of Belgian customers/visitors onboard our flights to/from both Brussels 
Charleroi and Zaventem Airports this summer." According to Belgian press agency Belga, the decision to close the 
Brussels base could risk 59 jobs. Denouncing the decision, ACV Puls union secretary Hans Elsen told Belga that 
the move is a 'bizarre form of competition between Charleroi and Brussels Airport'. He further stated that "Ryanair is 
cleverly exploiting them to make a profit."

Everyone's got their hot takes on the US CPI number and what it will mean for markets. Here's another (better) way 
to think of it  
Via Morgan Stanley's Iliana Bouzali[3] "You can't prove (a) hard landing right now... but it might be easier to prove 
falling inflation" There's a massive disconnect between where we are right now and where 'everyone' thinks (and 
history suggests) we're heading.  
But you can't get to a hard landing without first passing though the 'soft landing' phase. Or maybe neither of those 
apply. Aircraft analogies are tricky.  
Imagine yourself sat on a plane. Doesn't matter if you're uncomfortable on a Ryanair flight with your knees up round 
your ears or living it up in first class luxury.  
Just imagine yourself in that big metal tube 30,000 feet in the air...  
Suddenly, the plane starts plummeting towards the ground. Everyone's screaming, your life flashes before your 
eyes, call your family, say your goodbyes, it's over. That's a crash landing. (Like March 2020) 
There's only one bet to make in that scenario. Back the pilot to pull off a last minute miracle and regain control of 
the plane before it 'lands'.  
The plane might not pick up speed any time soon, but death is avoided (and betting on the end of the world is 
negative EV[4] in any case).  
So that's one scenario. Then you've got your soft or hard landings.  
Thinking The Right Way About CPI
Which is where the analogy falls apart. Because nobody really wants to 'land' an economy. It's supposed to remain 
in perpetual motion, more like the common swift[5] (airborne 99.5% of a 10 month migration, insane!) than a 
passenger plane.  
So, we don't actually want to land, we just want to stay in this Goldilocks zone for as long as possible.  
At some point later in the year, we'll probably trade the hard-landing fears (the overshoot). However, all that matters 
right now is the dominant theme.  
It's often said that markets can only focus on one thing at a time, and inflation is that theme right now. Back to Iliana 
and... The better way to think about it 
"This is not an email to forecast the exact CPI but rather to say, in the short term, it is easier to trade inflation falling 
than it is to trade growth falling""Inflation expectations are coming down faster than growth expectations. This 
sequencing matters for risk. The market got giddy on signs that inflation is moderating - over the last 12 months the 
SPX has rallied 2.8% on average on CPI misses versus sold off 1.3% on CPI beats."So are we supposed to buy the 
market here? No...A  low CPI might lull people into a lazy long. But I think to a large extent it's been pre-traded. We 
can agree on that... More importantly, as Mike Wilson pointed out, the recent CPI prints trapped people in bad 
trades. In October you got your face ripped off on a higher CPI and in December you got smoked on a weaker 
number. Couldn't agree more with the above. More detail here  
A savvy take on CPI by Iliana Bouzali at MS - she's among the very best. My 2c: the feeling that stocks are going 
higher is hard to shake. Being short is so tough with CTA buying and inflation moderating. But scarcity is what can 
give value to a short and why I think she's right. pic.twitter.com/xtBRNzICN0[6] — boaz weinstein (@boazweinstein) 
January 12, 2023[7]; 
There's so much nuance to the inflation data too. Is the service sector still strong? What about core services ex 
shelter? Is the recent 'Goldilocks' jobs report a sign of things to come? More workers return to the labour force sees 
wage pressures declining, but a resilient economy continues to grow and keeps hiring? 
That last one doesn't seem like the best bet...  
For now, it's all about inflation and wages. Another soft print today could see a continued risk rally. But how much is 
already in the price?  
My read is that we're not done with this Goldilocks theme just yet, but who really knows? Volatility around the event 
is assured. Beyond that, anything can happen, and it probably will.

Jan 11 (Reuters) - Ryanair RYA.I is closing its Brussels Zaventem base because of the airport's decision to 
increase prices from April, it said on Wednesday.
Europe's largest budget airline said the airport's decision comes at a time when most European airports are 
reducing prices to recover traffic lost during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Despite recent rumours, we will not be reopening our Brussels Zaventem base in summer 2023 due to Zaventem 
Airport's decision to increase prices by 11% for airlines and passengers from April 2023," Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary said in a statement.
"However, customers can still book Ryanair's low fares on 12 Zaventem routes that will continue to operate to/from 
Brussels Zaventem for S23 on aircraft based outside Belgium."
Belgian press agency Belga, which first reported the news quoting local union ACV Puls, said Ryanair's move puts 
59 jobs at risk.
The Irish airline, which operates two aircraft out of Brussels Airport, did not mention any impact on jobs.
Ryanair also operates 17 airplanes out of Belgium's Charleroi airport, south of Brussels, which it said will be 
unaffected by its Zaventem decision.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) is permanently shuttering its Brussels airport base as a result of the airport's decision to 
raise prices by 11% for both airlines and passengers from April, multiple media sources reported on Wednesday, 
citing the company's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
The airline initially decided to end operations from Brussel's Zaventem base in late October for the winter 2022 
season and has now reportedly decided against resuming operations this summer. The two aircraft that operate 
from Zaventem were relocated to other bases, according to a report.
O'Leary said in September 2022 that his decision to end operations at Zaventem resulted from the Belgian 
[government's] "decision to increase its 'eco' taxes."
Ryanair will still operate 12 Zaventem routes to and from Brussels for the summer of 2023 on aircraft based outside 
of Belgium, Reuters quoted O'Leary as saying.

Jan 09, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - January 9, 2023 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], Gol Linhas 
GOL[2], Delta Air Lines DAL[3] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[4]. Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Airline 
Stock Roundup: DAL, GOL, RYAAY and More In the past week, European carrier Ryanair Holdings lifted its profit 
after tax view for fiscal 2023 (ending Mar 31, 2023), owing to upbeat traffic in the Christmas season. Latin American 
carrier, Gol Linhas expects net revenues to be around R$20 billion for 2023, higher than the 2022 expectation of 
R$15.2 billion. 
Delta Air Lines was also in the news when it announced free Wi-Fi service on quite a few of DAL's domestic routes. 
JetBlue Airways was also a newsmaker in the past week, courtesy of the decision to tweak its New York-to-London 
flight schedule. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 For the fourth quarter of 2022, Gol Linhas anticipates[5] the 
EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, while it expects the EBIT margin to be 11%. GOL estimates the average 
fuel price per liter to be R$ 6.05. GOL anticipates a loss per share of $1.20 for the fourth quarter. The Zacks 
Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share. The unfavorable forecast is mainly due to high fuel 
costs. 
Fuel unit costs are anticipated to grow almost 42% year over year, backed by a 45% increase in the average jet fuel 
price, partially offset by a reduction of nearly 2% in fuel consumption per flight hour due to the higher number of 
737-MAXs in the fleet. For 2023, GOL anticipates earnings of 20 cents per share. 
To meet the expected domestic air-travel demand of nearly 100 billion revenue passenger kilometers for 2023, GOL 
aims to operate 120 aircraft on average during the year. GOL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), 
anticipates[6] to end 2023 with 53 Boeing MAX aircraft in its fleet. These Boeing MAX jets should boost productivity, 
reduce unit costs and lower carbon emissions.

2. Ryanair expects its third quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022) performance to have been boosted by the 
surge in traffic witnessed during the peak Christmas/New Year periods. Riding on the stronger-than-expected 
passenger volumes, profit after tax in the third quarter is anticipated to be nearly €200 million. Detailed third-quarter 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Ryanair , Gol Linhas, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue Airways
results will be out on Jan 30. Riding on a strong Q3, profit after tax for fiscal 2023 is now expected to be in the 
€1.325 billion - €1.425 billion range (earlier guidance was in the €1 billion to €1.20 billion band). 
RYAAY was also in the news recently regarding an enquiry by antitrust authorities in Italy over allegations of price-
fixing. That story was covered in theprevious week's write-up[8]. 
3. In a bid to make air-travel more attractive, Delta's management announced that free Wi-Fi will be available on 
more than 500 DAL planes operating on its most popular routes from February. This facility is expected to be 
available on all DAL flights across the globe by 2024-end in partnership with T-Mobile. 
4. JetBlue's management has reportedly[9] decided to add a new flight departing in the mornings from John F. 
Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to London Heathrow Airport from Mar 25. The new flight was added as JBLU 
got access to an additional pair of slots. JBLU has also decided to trim its schedule on the JFK - Gatwick Airport 
route. Only one flight will operate daily on the route from Mar 25, instead of the current two. The current daily 
schedule of three flights from JFK and London's two airports will remain unchanged. Performance All airline stocks 
traded in the green over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased 7.1% to $56.02 over the past 
week. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 0.8%. What's Next in the 
Airline Space? For the airline space, Delta will kickstart the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season on Jan 13. Upbeat 
air-travel demand is expected to have aided DAL's fourth-quarter performance. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks'

German air travel recovers more slowly from pandemic than EU peers
German air travel recovers more slowly from pandemic than EU peers

Air travel in Germany is recovering more slowly than in other European countries, an industry association said 
on Friday.
For the first half of 2023, the number of seats on offer looks set to reach around 78% of the 2019 figure before the 
pandemic broke out, according to the German Aviation Association (BDL).
However, other European countries are already offering 94% of the pre-pandemic level, the group said.
That is partly due to a lower level of domestic air travel, at 56% of pre-pandemic flight capacity, the group said.
But it is also because low-cost airlines are giving most German airports a wide berth as they ramp up their offerings 
elsewhere. Current flight plans show that the number of connections from German airports are down more than a 
third compared to before the pandemic.
However, some low-cost point-to-point airlines such as Ryanair or Wizz have significantly expanded the number of 
flights they are offering since the pandemic in the rest of Europe outside of Germany, with 114% of the 2019 level.
Of all Germany's larger airports, only four - Dortmund, Hahn, Karlsruhe and Memmingen - will have more flights 
available than in the same period in 2019. All are used by lower-cost airlines.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had criticized German airports in the past for their high fees and announced plans to 
grow in other markets.

Safety has always been an important factor when choosing an airline and that won't change in 2023.
Fortunately, airline safety and product rating website AirlineRatings.com has announced its annual list of the world's 
Top 20 Safest Airlines. Editors analyzed a whopping 385 different carriers and looked at a variety of key factors 
such as crashes over five years, serious incidents over two years, audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead 
associations; fleet age, expert analysis of pilot training and COVID protocols, among others to determine the safest 
airlines around the world.
Familiar names feature in the top 20 this year, including top-ranked Qantas. Australia's flag carrier climbed six spots 
from seventh in 2022, edging out second-place Air New Zealand, which ranked first a year ago. Meanwhile, Etihad 
Airways, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines remain firmly in the top five in 2023, with TAP Air Portugal falling 
one spot to sixth.
Emirates, Alaska Airlines, EVA Air and Virgin Australia/Atlantic round out the top 10 safest airlines this year. 
Coming in at eighth overall, Alaska ranks as the safest U.S. airline in 2023. However, four other domestic carriers 
made the cut, including Hawaiian Airlines (12th), United Airlines (14th), American Airlines (19th) and Delta Air Lines 
(20th).
Other airlines ranked among the top 20 safest include Cathay Pacific Airways, SAS, Lufthansa/Swiss Group, 
Finnair, British Airways and KLM.
"All airlines have incidents every day, and many are aircraft or engine manufacture issues, not airline operational 
problems. It is the way the flight crew handles these incidents that determines a good airline from an unsafe one," 
says AirlineRatings.com Editor-in-Chief Geoffrey Thomas. "Our top 20 safest airlines 2023 are always at the 
forefront of safety innovation, operational excellence, and the launching of new more advanced aircraft like the 
Airbus A350 and Boeing 787."
For budget-minded travelers not looking to sacrifice on safety, AirlineRatings.com also released its list of the top 20 
safest low-cost carriers for the upcoming year. They include (in alphabetical order) Air Arabia, AirAsia Group, 
Allegiant, Air Baltic, easyJet, FlyDubai, Frontier, Jetstar Group, JetBlue, Indigo, Ryanair, Scoot, Southwest, 
SpiceJet, Spirit, Vueling, Vietjet, Volaris, WestJet and Wizz.

German air travel slow to recover from COVID-19 pandemic
German air travel slow to recover from COVID-19 pandemic

Jan 07, 2023( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex)  
 Germany is lagging behind other EU countries in terms of seats sold on flights to and from the country, figures 
show. Domestic air travel is showing the slowest recovery from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Air travel to 
and from Germany in the first half of 2023 is likely to reach just 78% of the rate before the COVID pandemic broke 
out in 2020, according to figures released by the German Aviation Association (BDL) on Saturday. 
This means Germany is lagging behind its EU peers in the sector, with air travel in other European countries at 94% 
of the pre-pandemic level. 
The figure does, however, represent 20% growth compared with the first half of 2022. 
What are the reasons for the slow recovery? 
The BDL said the lower level of domestic air travel, which has reached only 56% of the pre-pandemic rate, is largely 
responsible for the slow recovery. 
"Here, a shift in traffic to road and rail is noticeable, among other things" it said. 
However, the drop in domestic flying can also be attributed to the fact that low-cost airlines are avoiding most 
German airports, while increasing their services elsewhere. 
This is reflected by statistics showing that the number of connections from German airports are more than a third 
lower than before the pandemic. 
Only four of Germany's larger airports — Dortmund, Hahn, Karlsruhe and Memmingen — will be offering more 
flights in the first half of 2023 than in the same period in 2019, largely owing to the presence of lower-cost airlines. 
The boss of the economy airline Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, has in the past criticized German airports for their high 
fees. His carrier and the cut-price airline Wizz have raised the number of flights they are offering outside of 
Germany. 
Long-haul flights, on the other hand, have made a better post-pandemic recovery, with trips to and from North 
America as the biggest factor.

Investors in British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) will be waiting for 
quarterly results, though data analysis by UBS points to supportive ticket prices.
The Swiss bank, in a research note, highlighted that economy airfares for the fourth quarter 2022 and first quarter 
2023 periods are "buoyant" whilst premium fares for fourth quarter 2022 have shown improvement.
UBS added that based on price data it believes the pricing environment has continued to improve and there's some 
evidence that the booking window (the time between booking and the journey) starting to lengthen, which would be 
a bullish signal for the sector as it gives greater visibility and denotes greater consumer confidence and longer-term 
travel planning.
In the European fare tracker report, UBS said recent observations suggest fourth quarter economy  fares are up 
31% and premium fares are up c26% year-on-year, whilst for the first quarter of 2023 they were 27% and 30% 
respectively.
For IAG, the bank reckons economy fare were up around 25% in the fourth and 19% for the first quarter, whilst 
premium fares are similarly estimated to be up 19% for both quarters.
"The next catalyst will be the 4Q22 results season but share price performance in the short term will likely be 
impacted by investor sentiment to risk in the new year," UBS analyst Jarrod Castle said in the note.

German air travel recovers slower from pandemic than European peers
German air travel recovers slower from pandemic than European peers

(Alliance News) - Air travel in Germany is recovering more slowly than in other European countries, an industry 
association said on Friday.
For the first half of 2023, the number of seats on offer looks set to reach around 78% of the 2019 figure before the 
pandemic broke out, according to the German Aviation Association (BDL).
However, other European countries are already offering 94% of the pre-pandemic level, the group said.
That is partly due to a lower level of domestic air travel, at 56% of pre-pandemic flight capacity, the group said.
But it is also because low-cost airlines are giving most German airports a wide berth as they ramp up their offerings 
elsewhere. Current flight plans show that the number of connections from German airports is down more than a 
third compared to before the pandemic.
However, some low-cost point-to-point airlines such as Ryanair or Wizz have significantly expanded the number of 
flights they are offering since the pandemic in the rest of Europe outside of Germany, with 114% of the 2019 level.
Of all Germany's larger airports, only four - Dortmund, Hahn, Karlsruhe and Memmingen - will have more flights 
available than in the same period in 2019. All are used by lower-cost airlines.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had criticized German airports in the past for their high fees and announced plans to 
grow in other markets.

Strike to cause 152 Ryanair flight cancellations in Belgium

(Alliance News) - A fresh strike by Ryanair Holdings PLC aircrew in Belgium will result in 152 flight cancellations 
this weekend at the country's second airport, Charleroi, the airport boss told AFP on Friday.
The stoppage by the 400 flight attendants based in Belgium for the Irish low-cost carrier – the biggest in Europe in 
terms of passengers transported – follows on from one over the New Year last weekend.
That caused around a hundred flight cancellations at Charleroi, which Ryanair uses at its main hub in the country.
The fresh strike on Saturday and Sunday is expected to lead to 76 outgoing and 76 incoming flights being 
cancelled, affected "some 20,000 passengers", Charleroi airport boss Philippe Verdonck said.
He said all those affected passengers had been notified by Ryanair.
The airline runs 15 aircraft out of Belgium, and the strike was only to affect those planes, and not ones it operates 
out of other European countries.
The head of the CNE union covering Ryanair staff, Didier Lebbe, said the employees would gather early on 
Saturday at Charleroi airport.
Ryanair employees staged several strikes in 2022. 
They notably accuse the airline of illegally pressuring some of them to fill in at bases in other European countries, 
especially in Dublin.
And they allege Ryanair is not correctly declaring them in the Belgian social security system and sometimes pays 
wages below the national legal minimum.
Ryanair on Wednesday said it forecast a higher post-tax profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, citing stronger-
than-expected travel demand and revenues over the end-of-year holiday period.

Ryanair upgraded its earnings forecasts after a bumper end to the year that saw stronger than expected demand 
for flying over the Christmas and new year holidays.
The low-cost airline's shares closed up 6 per cent yesterday after it said it expected to report profit after tax of 
between (EURO)1.3bn and (EURO)1.4bn in its current financial year ending in March, up from a previous guide 
range of (EURO)1bn-(EURO)1.2bn.
Ryanair enjoyed a bumper festive season, carrying more passengers than expected and it was able to charge 
comparatively high prices.
"Strong pent-up travel demand over the holiday season for the first time in three years, with no adverse impact from 
Covid or the war in Ukraine, stimulated stronger than expected peak Christmas/new year traffic and fares," the 
airline said. Ryanair forecast profit after tax of "close to" (EURO)200mn for the final three months of the year, its 
fiscal third quarter.
Analysts, industry executives and shareholders have been watching for any signs that demand for flying might fall 
amid the economic uncertainty gripping Europe.
So far people's taste for travel has withstood the cost of living crisis and runaway inflation, despite many airlines 
raising ticket prices.

Ryanair did warn that its new guidance was "heavily dependent upon avoiding adverse events" in the first three 
months of 2023, such as any potential worsening of the war in Ukraine, new developments in the coronavirus 
pandemic or poor economic conditions. Philip Georgiadis

Jan 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] lifted its profit after tax view for fiscal 2023 (ending 
Mar 31, 2023), owing to upbeat traffic in the Christmas season. Latin American carrier, Gol Linhas GOL[2] expects 
net revenues to be around R$20 billion for 2023, higher than the 2022 expectation of R$15.2 billion. 
Delta Air Lines DAL[3] was also in the news when it announced free Wi-Fi service on quite a few of DAL's domestic 
routes. JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] was also a newsmaker in the past week, courtesy of the decision to tweak its New 
York-to-London flight schedule. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 For the fourth quarter of 2022, Gol Linhas 
anticipates[5] the EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, while it expects the EBIT margin to be 11%. GOL 
estimates the average fuel price per liter to be R$ 6.05. GOL anticipates a loss per share of $1.20 for the fourth 
quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share. The unfavorable 
forecast is mainly due to high fuel costs. Fuel unit costs are anticipated to grow almost 42% year over year, backed 
by a 45% increase in the average jet fuel price, partially offset by a reduction of nearly 2% in fuel consumption per 
flight hour due to the higher number of 737-MAXs in the fleet. For 2023, GOL anticipates earnings of 20 cents per 
share. To meet the expected domestic air-travel demand of nearly 100 billion revenue passenger kilometers for 
2023, GOL aims to operate 120 aircraft on average during the year. GOL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), 
anticipates[6] to end 2023 with 53 Boeing MAX aircraft in its fleet. These Boeing MAX jets should boost productivity, 
reduce unit costs and lower carbon emissions.

2. Ryanair expects its third quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022) performance to have been boosted by the 
surge in traffic witnessed during the peak Christmas/New Year periods. Riding on the stronger-than-expected 
passenger volumes, profit after tax in the third quarter is anticipated to be nearly €200 million. Detailed third-quarter 
results will be out on Jan 30. Riding on a strong Q3, profit after tax for fiscal 2023 is now expected to be in the 
€1.325 billion - €1.425 billion range (earlier guidance was in the €1 billion to €1.20 billion band). 
RYAAY was also in the news recently regarding anenquiry by anti-trust authorities in Italy over allegations of price-
fixing. That story was covered in theprevious week's write-up[8].

3. In a bid to make air-travel more attractive, Delta's management announced that free Wi-Fi will be available on 
more than 500 DAL planes operating on its most popular routes from February. This facility is expected to be 
available on all DAL flights across the globe by 2024-end in partnership with T-Mobile. 
4. JetBlue's management has reportedly [9]decided to add a new flight departing in the mornings from John F. 
Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to London Heathrow Airport from Mar 25. The new flight was added as JBLU 
got access to an additional pair of slots. JBLU has also decided to trim its schedule on the JFK - Gatwick Airport 
route. Only one flight will operate daily on the route from Mar 25, instead of the current two. The current daily 
schedule of three flights from JFK and London's two airports will remain unchanged.

The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
increased 7.1% to $56.02 over the past week. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 0.8%. What's Next in the Airline Space? For the airline space, Delta will kickstart the fourth-quarter 
2022 earnings season on Jan 13. Upbeat air-travel demand is expected to have aided DAL's fourth-quarter 
performance.

After Golden Cross, Ryanair (RYAAY)'s Technical Outlook is Bright

Jan 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 After reaching an important support level, Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) could be a good stock pick from a 
technical perspective. RYAAY recently experienced a "golden cross" event, which saw its 50-day simple moving 
average breaking out above its 200-day simple moving average. 
Considered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed 
when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common 
crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts. 
Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that 
eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average 
and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices. 
This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish 
price movement. 
Shares of RYAAY have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 11%. Plus, the company is currently a #3 
(Hold) on the Zacks Rank, suggesting that RYAAY could be poised for a breakout. 
Looking at RYAAY's earnings expectations, investors will be even more convinced of the bullish uptrend. For the 
current quarter, there have been 1 changes higher compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate has moved up as well. 
Given this move in earnings estimates and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on 
RYAAY for more gains in the near future.

Retailers, airlines and banks rise, Next gains 7.5% on strong trading  
•
Standard Chartered rises and falls on Abu Dhabi interest and denial
4.39pm: FTSE closes higher again
FTSE 100 closed ahead again as traders appeared to shrug off falling European markets and yesterday's Fed 
minutes, which showed no slowdown in the desire to lift interest rates.
Britain's premier share index closed up by around 57 points, or 0.76%, at 7,642.
"The FTSE 100 ended 2022 as one of the best-performing indices, and it has started 2023 well too," said Chris 
Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
"Today has seen retailers at the head of the charge as Next pulls its usual trick of beating cautious estimates. This 
has seen Associated British Foods, Frasers Group and JD Sports make gains, although Next remains at the top of 
the pile with a 7% bounce.
"Investors, it seems, are keen to find havens away from the carnage in tech stocks, and the FTSE 100 is a prime 
candidate for this, given that only Ocado would really be accorded the moniker of a 'tech stock'."
3.45pm: FTSE continues strong start to the year
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders turn to index to avoid tech stocks
Heading to the close and it has been another busy day of news, broker comment, rumour and denial with London's 
blue chips enjoying another strong session.
The FTSE 100 is up over 50 points continuing its strong start to the year shrugging aside further losses in the US 
where the Dow fell over 300 points as strong jobs data and comments from Esther George, president and chief 
executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (see 2.54pm update), that interest rates would continue to 
rise to above 5% dented the mood.
Retailers led the way with upbeat trading statements from Next PLC, B&M European Value Retail SA and Greggs 
PLC although the latter fell slightly as the day progressed.
Next rose strongly after raising guidancefor the current, as did B&M, while Christmas cheer was also in evidence at 
Greggs where sales rose strongly.
And with Boots adding to the upbeat mood (see 1.05pm update)retailers moved higher across the board with 
Primark owner, Associated British Foods plc, JD Sports Fashion plc and Frasers Group plc amongst those on the 
rise.
Airlines were another positive feature as Irish carrier, RyanAir, upgraded its guidancefor the current year sending 
shares higher across the airline sector (see 12.40pm update)with International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, the 
Anglo-Spanish company which owns British Airways, rising 3.2%, while Hungarian company Wizz Air Holdings plc 
soared 9.64% and easyJet plc flew 6.6%.
The banking sector also enjoyed an eventful day. In what must be one of the quickest rumour and denial stories in 
stock market history, shares in Standard Chartered soared over 20% on reported bid interest from Abu Dhabi Bank.
But within 20 minutes of the reported interest came an official denial (see 1.52pm update).
Abu Dhabi Bank said in a statement: ""First Abu Dhabi Bank confirms that it had previously been at the very early 
stages of evaluating a possible offer for Standard Chartered, but as of the date of this announcement, is no longer 
doing so."
The shares lost some of their froth but settled around 8% to the good.
Elsewhere in the sector, HSBC Holdings PLC gained over 3% (the Standard Chartered rumours helped too) as 
Jefferies upgraded to buy, hiking its price target by 42% in the process (see 9.15am update)while Lloyds Banking 
Group PLC was also in favour at the same broker which said the high street lender could showinvestors close to 
60% upside.
"Quality at a reasonable price" the broker declared.
An upbeat note on the travel European Lesiure sector from UBS aided Whitbread PLC and InterContinental Hotels 
Group plc, while positive comments from JP Morgan supported food retailers, Tesco PLC and J Sainsbury PLC 
ahead of their trading statements next week (see 10.04am update).
"Despite headwinds of inflation, a stretched consumer and slowing economic activity, we expect that the travel 
recovery will continue" UBS said on the European leisure sector.
"While leisure travel and margins are likely to be impacted (occupancy vs price trade-off), we forecast profitability to 
grow" analysts added.
But a downgrade by Bank of America sent Pearson PLC lower. The broker moved to underperform with an 865p 
price target.
3.30pm: Silvergate Capital to axe 40% of workforce
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders turn to index to avoid tech stocks
Cryptocurrency bank Silvergate Capital has revealed it faced mass withdrawal requests totalling over US$8bn, in 
the aftermath of the collapse of FTX.com, and is cutting its workforce by around 40%.
Silvergate reported that its total deposits from digital asset customers declined to US$3.8bn on the last day of 2022, 
down from US$11.9bn on September 30, 2022.
Silvergate says the digital asset industry has undergone "a transformational shift, with significant over-leverage in 
the industry leading to several high-profile bankruptcies".
Having hired staff during 2022, Silvergate is now reducing its headcount by approximately 200 employees, or 40%, 
to "account for the economic realities facing the business and industry today".
2.54pm: Strong US jobs data sends sterling lower
The pound has slipped back against the US dollar following the strong jobs data in the US which suggested that the 
US interest rates will continue to rise.
The strong ADP report and lower than expected weekly jobless claims numbers followed the release of December's 
FOMC meeting yesterday in which Fed officials repeated their commitment to tackling inflation.
Echoing that sentiment today, Esther George, president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 
City, told CNBC that she favoured holding rates above 5% for some time.
""I'll be over 5% and I see us staying there for some time until we get the signals that inflation is really convincingly 
starting to fall back towards our 2% goal" she said.
In reaction sterling dipped 1.1% to US$1.192.
2.42pm: US opens lower after strong ADP report
US stocks slipped at the open on Thursday as private sector payroll data for December has indicated that the labor 
market remains strong.
ADP reported a 235,000 increase in private payrolls, well above the consensus analyst expectation per The Wall 
Street Journal of 153,000.  
The release of the Fed's December meeting minutes yesterday may have dampened sentiment according to 
OANDA market analyst Craig Erlam.
"The narrative from the central bank is very much in line with what we should expect," he said. "Policymakers are 
desperately trying to convince markets how serious they are about defeating inflation, to the point that investors are 
seemingly paying less attention."
Tech layoffs, with Salesforce and Amazon the latest industry giants to announce cost-cutting measures, are also in 
focus.
"The economic cycle has turned rapidly leaving those companies over-staffed and while that would ideally not result 
in mass lay-offs, it was always likely to," Erlam commented.
"While other sectors may also gradually start laying off staff in response to the economic downturn, I don't expect it 
will be on the same scale, not unless the outlook worsens considerably."
Just after the market opened, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had shed 299 points or 0.9% at 32,971 points, the 
S&P 500 was down 33 points or 0.9% at 3,820 points, and the Nasdaq Composite had lost 112 points or 1.1% at 
10,347 points.

Meanwhile, meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond Inc had tanked about 20.7% following a warning from the struggling 
company that bankruptcy is on the table.
2.30pm: Strong ADP number points to upbeat non-farm payrolls number
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics has upped his forecast for tomorrow's non-parm 
payrolls in the wake of the strong ADP report which he noted was consistent with the robust Homebase 
employment data.
He accepted that ADP has published only four previous payroll numbers using its new methodology but pointed out 
three of the previous four readings have undershot the official private jobs number, and the median error has been -
95,000.
"This is nothing like enough to prove definitively that the ADP's number is systematically biased to the downside, 
but it does make us more comfortable in our forecast of an above-consensus payroll print tomorrow" he said.
"We are nudging up our estimate to 275,000 from 250,000; the consensus is 200,000" he wrote.
1.52pm: Standard Charered jumps on bid talk
Shares in Standard Chartered have leapt following reports - subsequntly denied - that First Abu Dhabi Bank was 
looking at bidding for the FTSE 100 listed lender.
Bloomberg News reported that Abu Dhabi Bank was preparing to bid for the City stalwart, which was set up in 1853 
in South Africa before opening its first branches in India a few years later sending shares up over 20% initially.
But in a roller coaster few minutes reports soon followed that the bank was no longer in talks to buy the bank.
In a statement the bank said "First Abu Dhabi Bank confirms that it had previously been at the very early stages of 
evaluating a possible offer for Standard Chartered, but as of the date of this announcement, is no longer doing so."

1.40pm: US futures reverse after strong jobs data
US futures went into reverse as yet again the US jobs market showed its resilience with a strong ADP jobs report 
followed by lower than expected jobless claims data.
The ADP report showed that private employers added 235,000 jobs in December against 127,000 in November and 
ahead of Street forecasts for a rise of 150,000.
"The labor market is strong but fragmented, with hiring varying sharply by industry and establishment size.
Business segments that hired aggressively in the first half of 2022 have slowed hiring and in some cases cut jobs in 
the last month of the year" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.
Meanwhile weekly initial jobless claims were 204,000, below forecasts of 225,000, and last week's revised figure of 
223,000.

US futures which had been higher are now sharply lower - Dow futures are down 175 points, S&P 500 futures are 
down 22 points and Nasdaq futures are 75 points lower.
1.05pm: Boots sales up as jabs boost footfall
More positive news from the UK's high streets with Boots UK reporting sales were up around 15% in December, 
compared with a year earlier.
The health and beauty retailer and pharmacy chain, part of the Walgreens Boots Alliance, said gifting, beauty and 
fragrance lines all performed "extremely well" while there was also an uptick in sales of over-the-counter medicines 
for "colds and immunity."
Footfall at its stores rose by about 8% as it administered more than 1.4mln flu vaccinations and over 220,000 Covid 
jabs while a further boost came as city centre stores benefitted from the return to the office, the group said.
Boots UK also reports a "record-breaking Black Friday" with boots.com recording its biggest ever day of sales.
Like-for-like sales in the September-November quarter were up 8.7% year-on-year.
Sebastian James, managing director of Boots UK & ROI, said it was "another positive quarter" for the group.
12.40pm: Airlines lift off as RyanAir lifts profit forecast
Shares in UK listed airlines airlines took off taking heart from news that Ryanair had increased its profit forecast for 
the year.
The Irish carrier celebrated a strong Christmas, the first with no hit from Covid-19 in three years, with the number of 
passengers rising by more than a fifth to 11.5mln in December.
The strong trading prompted the company to raise its March 2023 forecast for net profit to be between 
(EURO)1.325bn and (EURO)1.425bn, 25% better than the previous guidance range.
This sparked gains across the airline sector with International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, the Anglo-Spanish 
company which owns British Airways, rising 3.2%, while Hungarian company Wizz Air Holdings plc soared 9.64% 
and easyJet plc flew 6.6%.
12.00pm: Modest gains seen across the pond
Wall Street is expected to open higher as traders continue to digest minutes from the latest Federal Open Market 
Committee meeting, while Republicans remain deadlocked over the election of a speaker for the US House of 
Representatives.
Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% in Thursday pre-market trading, while those for the broader 
S&P 500 index also gained 0.1% and contracts for the Nasdaq-100 added 0.2%.
Minutes of the December meeting show Federal Reserve officials remain committed to fighting inflation and expect 
higher interest rates to stay in place until more progress is made. After initially declining on the release of the 
minutes, stocks turned around to end Wednesday higher.
At the close the DJIA was up 0.4% to 33,270, the S&P 500 rose 0.8% to 3,853 while the Nasdaq Composite 
advanced 0.7% to 10,459.
As well as the Fed's hawkish stance, traders are also contemplating the possibility of another upbeat set of non-
farm payrolls tomorrow, commented James Hughes, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.
"However, the literal elephant in the room here is the ongoing tussle by Republicans in Washington to elect a house 
speaker," Hughes said. "Whilst common consensus may be that political gridlock is good because it prevents 
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders turn to index to avoid tech stocks
businesses being blindsided by policy change, the US debt ceiling needs to be lifted again by the summer so 
lawmakers need to get down to business."
House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has sufferered defeat in six rounds of voting across two days, with the House 
approving a motion to adjourn until noon today. The House can't kick off the new Congress or swear in new 
members until a speaker is elected.
Hughes noted that ADP Payroll data is due before the opening bell today, while two Fed policymakers are due to 
give speeches later in the session.
"Any nuance here over the extent of policy tightening is likely to be closely followed, with risk potentially on the 
upside if any dovish tones emerge," he added.
11.45am: RWE and Equinor in hydrogen push
Germany has made another push to reduce its dependency on Russian gas by signing a deal to build new 
hydrogen power plants.
The energy giant RWE has agreed with its Norwegian rival Equinor to make joint investments in hydrogen-ready 
gas-fired power plants in Germany, which will have a total capacity of 3 gigawatts by 2030.
 The German and Norwegian energy companies @RWE_AG and @Equinor just announced to jointly develop 
large-scale value chains for low-CO2 hydrogen. They aim to replace German coal-fired power plants with hydrogen-
compatible gas-fired power plants: https://t.co/kUGKzwR5up - AHK Norwegen (@AHKNorwegen) January 5, 2023
The agreement also includes the construction of a pipeline to carry hydrogen from Norway to Germany together 
with the joint development of offshore wind farms that will enable production of renewable hydrogen as fuel for 
power and other industrial customers in the future.
The project will initially focus on low-carbon "blue" hydrogen, with a target of generating fully-renewable "green" 
hydrogen in the future.
"The collaboration has the potential to develop Norway into a key supplier of hydrogen to Germany and Europe" 
said Anders Opedal, Equinor's CEO and president.
"In order to make progress in the conversion from fossil fuels to hydrogen, there is an urgent need for a rapid ramp 
up of the hydrogen economy. Blue hydrogen in large quantities can make a start, with subsequent conversion into 
green hydrogen supply" said Dr Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE.
11.20am: UK hiring outlook positive but slowing according to Manpower
Global recruiter ManpowerGroup has found that the net employment outlook for UK employers - a measure of hiring 
optimism - remained positive for the first quarter of 2023 at +19%.
The survey of 2,030 UK employers did show however that the overall intention to hire is slowing down for a third 
quarter running, with many UK employers currently recruiting just to retain talent and maintain position in the 
context of today's challenging economic circumstances.  
"Talent retention is going to be a battle for most employers this year" said Chris Gray, director at ManpowerGroup 
UK. "We're seeing hiring cool for the third quarter running, but the demand for skilled talent is still outstripping 
supply."
"This situation can be likened to a leaky bucket - employers have to keep hiring at pace just to maintain position 
and not lose out amidst an ongoing skills shortage" Gray added.
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders turn to index to avoid tech stocks
In terms of sector demand,  IT led the pack with a net employment outlook of +34%, level with the last quarter, as 
80% of IT firms struggled to find talent, and 58% of tech firms reported IT and data skills are the most difficult to 
find.
10.45am: One in six UK companies affected by strike action
One in six UK companies have been hit by the industrial action currently engulfing the country.
The latest survey of British firms from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that 16% of businesses had 
been affected by strikes with a quarter of those firms unable to obtain necessary goods for their business.
One in 20 companies with at least 10 employees are planning to make redundancies over the next three months, 
the ONS found, with two-thirds taking action to cut staff costs.
Yet, almost a third of businesses with 10 or more employees reported they were experiencing a shortage of 
workers, including half of firms in the human health and social work activities industry.
And looking ahead to this month, more than one in five businesses reported energy prices were their main concern, 
followed by input price inflation (15%) and falling demand of goods and services (14%).
10.04am: JP Morgan upbeat on food retailers
JP Morgan has made bullish comments on the UK food retailers ahead of their trading updates next week.
"Following yesterday's stronger than expected Christmas performance of the traditional grocers published by Kantar 
and supportive UK consumer survey results over the key festive weeks we believe both Tesco and Sainsbury to be 
well placed to over-deliver on current market expectations into their upcoming trading updates" the broker 
commented.
As a result JPM has upped its expectations for this year top-line and earnings by 1% for Tesco, reitered its 
overweight rating with an unchanged price target of 270p.
On Sainsbury, the broker has raised its price target by 3% to 213p although it has kept an underweight rating.
"We continue to see in Tesco a safer way to play the theme given the markets' more realistic expectations into next 
year and its cheaper valuation vs Sainsbury" it said.
9.55am: Pearson hit by Bank of America downgrade
Plenty of broker comment moving stocks today as analysts come back from the Christmas break full of fresh 
thinking.
One share heading downwards is Pearson which has fallen 4.9% following a downgrade by Bank of America to 
underperform from neutral with a 865p price target.
But shares in Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC rose 1.1% as analysts at Citi revised their net present value (NPV)-
based price target to £19.20 with a £28-£11 bull-bear valuation range for the stock.
Analysts pointed out: "The launch of gXyrem this week and further expansion of the MENA biosimilar collaboration 
with Celltrion are incremental positives. Updated forecasts reflect upgrades at US Generics, though note we remain 
extremely conservative, as well as better margin resilience at Injectables. Higher net financial charges and FX 
provide a partial offset."
9.45am: UK service sector PMI improves in December
The UK service sector remained inside contraction territory, but only just as 2022, with the PMI rising to 49.9 in 
December from 48.8 in November.
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders turn to index to avoid tech stocks
Although the best reading since September, and indicative of a broad stabilisation of activity, the latest survey data 
from S&P/CIPS and anecdotal evidence from panellists nonetheless painted a picture of a difficult operating 
environment.
 ???????? UK Services #PMI rose to 49.9 in December (Nov: 48.8), indicating a near-stabilisation of services 
activity at the end of 2022. #Employment levels were unchanged though, ending a run of growth going back to early 
2021. Read more: https://t.co/STRLQbhIBR pic.twitter.com/PPiXpbMXYr - S&P Global PMI(TM) (@SPGlobalPMI) 
January 5, 2023
On the bright side new business fell at its weakest rate for three months and cost pressures also showed signs of 
weakening, with inflation rates down for both operating expenses and charges.
Nonetheless, price pressures remain elevated, and the business environment challenging.
Firms subsequently exhibited a cautious attitude to hiring staff, which overall were left unchanged compared to 
November.
9.25am: New car sales at 30-year low
New car registrations in the UK fell last year to their lowest level in three decades, new figures from the Society of 
Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show.
Despite a recovery in the second half of 2022, a continuing parts shortage hit production lines.

Meanwhile, demand for electric vehicles continued to grow and they accounted for almost a fifth of new car sales.
But charging infrastructure is not being built quickly enough to cope with growing demand, warned the Society of 
Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
Across the whole of 2022, 1.61mln new cars were registered in the UK, the lowest level since 1992.
"It's still the long Covid effect," said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. "The key issue is global disruption to 
supply chains," he added.
"The demand we know is there... manufacturers have just really struggled to be able to make vehicles in sufficient 
quantities."
9.15am: HSBC in favour at Jefferies
Away from the high street and another stock on the move today was HSBC Holdings PLC which advanced 2.1% as 
Jefferies added the company to its buy list and hiked its price target by 42% to 770p from 574p.
"We believe the China/HK re-opening and capital return prospects of HSBC are underappreciated attributes which 
create positive return/risk asymmetry" the broker said.
The broker suggested a re-opened economy would drive higher loan demand and general activity which should 
benefit the FTSE 100 listed lender.
Upgrading the stock to buy from hold analysts estimated that the sale of the bank's Canada business can unlock 
US$14bn of buybacks and special dividends across 2023 and 2024.
As a result it sees "see credible re-rating potential given estimated 13% ROTE in 2024."
9.00am: Retailers confound expectations with strong sales
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders turn to index to avoid tech stocks
Retailers lead the way today with the strong trading statements from Next, Greggs and B&M giving a lift to the likes 
of JD Sports Fashion plc, Frasers Group plc, ASOS plc, Marks & Spencer Group plc and Primark owner, 
Associated British Foods PLC amongst others.
Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon pointed out the news painted a picture that doesn't fit narrative 
of doom and gloom.
 First few UK festive trading updates (Next, B&M, Greggs) painting a picture that doesn't fit narrative of doom & 
gloom. In our 2023 outlook we noted regressive nature of staples inflation would generate some incredibly difficult 
hardships - but may not be reflected at macro level - Simon French (@shjfrench) January 5, 2023
He suggested this may reflect strong aggregate household balance sheets, behavioural adaptations and high 
vacancy rates.
Next remained the star performer, up nearly 6%, after better-than-expected Christmas trading figures.
Stifel analyst Caroline Gulliver believes Next's Christmas performance, particularly in stores, "will make it one of the 
retail clothing & home winners this Christmas," and its forecast fiscal year 2023 pre-tax profit decline of only 8%, 
 "will make it one of the most resilient retailers in calendar 2023."
She pointed out the guidance for the current year of £860mln was around 3% above consensus of £835mln and 
Stifel £837mln forecast, while the estimate for fiscal year 2024 of £795mln was around £12mln ahead of consensus.
The broker recently upgraded the retailer to buy.
ON B&M, which is trading 1.8% higher, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves 
Lansdown commented "''The appetite for bargain hunting has increased sharply amid the big cost-of-living squeeze 
with shoppers flooding into discount stores."
"B&M European Value retail is benefitting from this trend with its cut-price products piled high in baskets during the 
pre-Christmas period."
Stifel analyst David Hughes agreed. He said the performance "reflects the draw of B&M's strong price position at a 
time when the rising cost-of-living crisis continues to put pressure on household budgets."
Greggs, up 0.8%, was also seen as benefiting from its value offering.
"Essentially, Greggs has a lot going in its favour because it exists at the end of the value spectrum, and the group is 
capitalising on this" noted Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown noted.
She pointed out the bakery-chain's pricing is also being held as a "key area of strength in current conditions, and 
has meant that together with cost savings, margins have held up for the full year."
8.15am: FTSE 100 lifted by retail cheer
Trading in London got off to a better than expected start as a batch of upbeat trading statements across the retail 
sector confounded expectations for a weaker start.
At 8.15am the FTSE 100 was up 5 points at 7,590 while the FTSE 250 fell slightly, down 29 points, to 19,362.
Next PLC gave investors a late Christmas present as it reported better-than-expected Christmas sales, up 4.8%, 
which compared to previous guidance for a fall of 2%.
This prompted the clothing retailer to raise its pre-tax profit forecast for the current year by £20mln to £860mln 
although it expects Inflation in essential goods, particularly energy, rising mortgage costs and continued price 
inflation would dampen demand in the coming year with profits seen falling to £795mln.
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders turn to index to avoid tech stocks
But as Peel Hunt pointed out this guidance was still £30mln ahead of its current forecast and £12mln ahead of 
consensus estimates.
"Overall, a more positive tone than autumn, which we expect to feed into the shares" the broker said. They were 
right with shares up 5.8%.
Greggs also rose in early trading, up 1%, as it held full year guidance as strong sales of seasonal goods such as its 
festive bake, sweet mince pies and salted caramel lattes pushed fourth quarter sales up 18.2%.
The retailer, famed for its value sausage rolls, said sales for fiscal year 2022 were £1,513mln, up 23.0%, compared 
to last year with like-for-like sales in company-managed shops 17.8% higher than sales seen in 2021.
B&M European Value Retail also rose as it reported strong momentum across its "golden" third quarter despite a 
challenging macroeconomic environment.
In the 13-week period from September 25, revenue grew by 12% year-on-year to £1.57bn with a very good 
performance across all B&M UK categories as well as solid momentum in B&M France and Heron Foods.
As a result, it forecast full-year earnings between £560mln to £580mln, above current analyst outlook consensus of 
£557mln.
The group also expects to pay a special dividend of 20.0p per share and the shares responded by rising 2.3%.
 
7.50am: Cable goes bearish, Fed sticks to its guns, EUR responds to surprisingly cool inflation data
In further proof of a cooling UK housing market, mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since June 2020 in 
November, according to yesterday's reading.
Today's services and manufacturing output data will likely add to all-round proof of a cooling economy.
Economic cooling was the trend on both sides of the Atlantic- In the US, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 
minutes released yesterday showed the committee expects growth this year to be below trend, but that is needed to 
bring supply and demand into balance and reduce inflationary pressures.
Yet as Pantheon Macroeconomics noted, "FOMC members remain focussed on current inflation and inflation risks, 
with fear of overkill on monetary policy receiving very little attention".
Amid these data points, Cable closed the Wednesday session 0.75% higher at 1.205, effectively recouping 
Tuesday's losses.
But the pair went bearish this morning, cutting back to 1.202 in the Asia trading window.
GBP/USD hits low note after Wednesday surge - Source: capital.com
Advance Eurozone inflation data is throwing out some surprises. Headline inflation in December is expected to read 
below 9% tomorrow (although core inflation is likely to stay constant).
The downward revision follows yesterday's single-digit German inflation surprise, sparking renewed hope for a 
gentler central bank policy and improvement in the Eurozone bond market.
On that note, bund yields, despite edging higher this morning, have dipped to 2.3% from 2.57% on December 30.
EUR/USD closed 0.6% higher yesterday, and has so far remained flat at 1.060 today.
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders turn to index to avoid tech stocks
EUR/GBP closed slightly lower yesterday, but the pair has added 0.3% to 88.21p in this morning's Asia trading 
hours.
7.40am: Strong Christmas at Next but profits to fall next year
Next PLC (LSE:NXT) gave investors some good and bad news as it updated on trading today with strong Christmas 
sales offset by a warning that profits would fall in 2023/24.
Trading in the nine weeks to 30 December was strong with full price sales up +4.8% versus last year which was 
around £66mln better than the retailer's previous guidance of -2.0% for the period given in November.   
As a result the FTSE 100 listed group has increased its full year profit before tax guidance by £20mln 
to £860mln, up +4.5% versus last year with EPS seen at 567.2p, up +6.9% versus last year.
Retail sales were particularly strong in the period, up 12.5%, while online sales rose 0.2%, while the end-of-season 
sale is progressing well and clearance rates are ahead of our expectations.
But the clothing seller was cautious as it looked ahead to the coming year expecting full price sales to fall 1.5% 
taking pre-tax profits down 7.6% to £795mln.
7.05am: FTSE seen lower
FTSE 100 is expected to open lower after two days of gains following the release of the FOMC minutes which 
showed Fed officials remain steadfast in their commitment to tackling inflation.
Spread betting companies are calling the lead index down by around 19 points.
US markets broadly shrugged off the minutes but closed off earlier highs with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 
133 points, or 0.4%, to 33,270, the S&P 500 up 29 points, or 0.75%, to 3,853 and the Nasdaq Composite up 72 
points, or 0.69%, to 10,459.
Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank noted "The FOMC minutes were hawkish enough to get the 
S&P500 erase early gains, but not hawkish enough to get the index to close in the red."
"Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data 
provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2%, which was likely to take some time," 
the meeting summary stated.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics noted "FOMC members remain focused on 
current and inflation and inflation risks, with fear of overkill on monetary policy receiving very little attention."
"In other words, don't expect them to soften their inflation line until it becomes blindingly obvious that a serious shift 
in the data is underway."
In London, retailers will take centre with a batch of Christmas trading updates due from B&M European Value Retail 
SA (LSE:BME), Greggs PLC and Next PLC (LSE:NXT) (Next PLC (LSE:NXT)).
Another batch of PMI surveys are also due in the UK and the US while initial jobless claims figures in the US will 
give a further guide as to the health of the US jobs market ahead of tomorrow's non-farm payrolls numbers.

Strong pent-up demand over the holiday season has prompted Ryanair to post a more optimistic outlook with the 
group now indicating that it expects to earn more yearly profit than previously anticipated.
The low-cost carrier indicated that it was the first time in three years that holiday season traffic was not affected by 
external factors such as COVID-19 or the war in Ukraine. As such, strong pent-up travel demand resulted in a 
"stronger than expected peak Christmas/New Year traffic and fares".
The group now estimates that its Profit After Tax (PAT) in FY2023, which ends on March 31, 2022, will be between 
(EURO)1.325 and (EURO)1.425 billion ($1.4 and $1.51 billion). Its previous PAT guidance estimated year-end 
results between (EURO)1 and (EURO)1.2 billion ($1.06 and $1.27 billion). Ryanair emphasized that its passenger 
number estimate of 168 million remained unchanged.
In December 2022, the group, which consists of Ryanair, Buzz, Lauda, and Malta Air, carried 11.5 million 
passengers, 21% more than in December 2021. The average load factor was 92%, an 11% growth Year-on-Year 
(YoY). In total, throughout the past 12 months, 160.4 million passengers flew with the low-cost carrier group, as the 
load factor averaged 92%.
Ryanair's shares on the NASDAQ stock exchange rose 10% following the news on January 4, 2023, while the 
Dublin-listed company's stock opened 3.6% higher on January 5, 2022.
On December 7, 2022, the group extended its current CEO Michael O'Leary's contract until July 2028, giving the 
Irish executive a four-year extension. O'Leary will oversee Ryanair's development as it tries to achieve its goal of 
carrying 225 million passengers by 2026 while also developing the group's strategy until the end of the current 
decade.

Do cabin crew have a favorite aircraft? Cabin crew can be trained on up to four aircraft types at a time (as long as 
two are of the same family), so we may get some variation of aircraft during our careers. Some cabin crew only 
work on one type their whole careers, while others will collect a few different types. Do cabin crew have favorites? 
In general, yes!
Types
When cabin crew do their initial training, they are trained on the specific aircraft type or types that the airline uses. 
So, someone working for Flydubai or Ryanair, for example, will only train on the Boeing 737, whereas if they were 
working for British Airways or Etihad Airways, they may have three or four different types. These can be from the 
same family, for example, the Airbus A319, A320, A321, and A350. Alternatively, there could be a mix of aircraft like 
Airbus A319, A320, and Boeing 777 and 787.
Training
It all starts with training. The aircraft-specific training encompasses safety features on the aircraft, door operations, 
emergency equipment location and much more. All aircraft types differ and have different variants, so a Boeing 737 
could also be a 737-400 or 737 MAX - in total, there have been 23 variants of the Boeing 737 over the years.
The configuration may be different on the same type of aircraft, the safety equipment might be different, as well as 
the operator's safety procedures. Therefore, even if qualified on one type and you move to another operator, you 
still have to repeat the aircraft-specific training. Often, one of the aircraft learned during the first initial training will 
become a favorite.
Experience
Aircraft experience on type is also a factor, some cabin crew are more comfortable with the aircraft type that they've 
flown on the most. Obviously, the more hours you work on the type, the better knowledge you have of the safety 
equipment, locations and procedures, so that may become a favorite. Certainly, the A320 is a very popular aircraft, 
many cabin crew have been trained on it, and many airlines use it. Many cabin crew like the A319 (or the 'baby bus' 
as it's nicknamed) and A320 for those reasons.
Which aircraft do airline cabin crew love to work on?
Issues
Sometimes, crew members may not like an aircraft. It can be due to the door operation, which is crucial for cabin 
crew to get right. An inadvertent slide deployment is certainly not good! On the old 737 types, the girt bar and slide 
had to be attached manually to the floor brackets. This seems very 'old school' now, along with the red strap across 
the window, signifying that the door was in automatic.
Most aircraft have power-assisted doors and more visible signage to show that door positioning is correct. Some 
doors are just 'uncooperative' and we've all got bruises from a door at some point. Some doors have unusual door 
operating systems, like the Embraer 190, which can be difficult to get used to at first.
Memories
Personal memories of working on an aircraft can also make it a favorite type. Some crew may have had a fantastic 
trip and remember the aircraft because of this. Sometimes, it's about the crew you worked with that made the 
aircraft fun. Some crew have been lucky enough to have sat in the cockpit for landings and seen amazing views 
outside.
Now, with some types rarely used or no longer being made, there is some nostalgia to it as well. Any cabin crew 
who flew on the Boeing 747 will never forget it! Working on a huge aircraft with an upper deck, traveling far and 
wide, watching the wings flex in flight - it is an incredible aircraft. A380 crew will no doubt say something similar - it's 
an experience.
Favorites
In conclusion, cabin crew have their favorites for a number of reasons. The Airbus family are very popular with 
cabin crew as a whole, along with Boeing 777 and 787. Any standouts? The A319/320 for its familiarity and ease to 
work on, and the Boeing 747 and 767 for being unique and knowing that you were flying somewhere a long way 
away. simpleflying.com

Do cabin crew have a favorite aircraft? Cabin crew can be trained on up to four aircraft types at a time (as long as 
two are of the same family), so we may get some variation of aircraft during our careers. Some cabin crew only 
work on one type their whole careers, while others will collect a few different types. Do cabin crew have favorites? 
In general, yes!
Types
When cabin crew do their initial training, they are trained on the specific aircraft type or types that the airline uses. 
So, someone working for Flydubai or Ryanair, for example, will only train on the Boeing 737, whereas if they were 
working for British Airways or Etihad Airways, they may have three or four different types. These can be from the 
same family, for example, the Airbus A319, A320, A321, and A350. Alternatively, there could be a mix of aircraft like 
Airbus A319, A320, and Boeing 777 and 787.

Why Ryanair Holdings Flew Higher This Week

Jan 05, 2023( The Motley Fool: http://www.fool.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 What happened 
Ryanair(NASDAQ: RYAAY) flew more passengers than anticipated over the holiday season, leading the European 
discount airline to up its forecast for the year. Shares of Ryanair enjoyed their own "Santa Claus Rally" as a result, 
up as much as 12% for the week, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence[1]. 
So what 
While the travel focus over the holiday season in the U.S. was on weather-related delays, it was apparently smooth 
skies over Europe. On Wednesday, Ireland-based airline[2] Ryanair upped its yearly earnings forecast, saying 
strong demand over Christmas and New Year's would boost its results. 
Ryanair said it expects to report a profit of between 1.325 billion euros and 1.425 billion euros in its current fiscal 
year ending in March, up significantly from previous guidance for a profit in the range of 1 billion euros to 1.2 billion 
euros. 
"Strong pent-up travel demand over the holiday season for the first time in three years, with no adverse impact from 
COVID or the war in Ukraine, stimulated stronger than expected peak Christmas/New Year traffic and fares," 
Ryanair said in a statement. 
Ryanair flew 11.5 million passengers in December, up 21% year over year. In the past 12 months the airline has 
flown 160.4 million passengers, up 121% from the prior period. 
Now what 
Investors will learn more on Jan. 30, when Ryanair is scheduled to release full results from its recently completed 
fiscal third quarter. But it appears after a pandemic-related lull, air travel is finally recovering in Europe. 
If so, there could still be room for Ryanair to fly higher. Even after this week's rally the stock is still down 22.9% over 
the last year. The first attempt at a European "reopening rally" was thwarted by the war in Ukraine. If Ryanair is 
correct, the European travel industry might finally be back to business as usual after years of issues.

Analysts at Liberum Capital have upgraded their rating for Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) to 'buy' from 'hold' 
after "strong holiday season demand" for the budget airline led to a better-than-expected December 2022 quarter.
In a note to clients, the analysts said: "Management now expects March 2023E net profit to be between 
(EURO)1.325bn and (EURO)1.425bn, 25% better than the previous guidance range.
"We raise our forecasts accordingly. The higher base from 2023E and favourable fuel and FX movements see our 
2024E estimates rise to a level that makes the valuation no longer appear stretched."
"Consequently," they added, "we increase our target price to (EURO)16 from (EURO)13 (CY2023E EV/IC / 
ROIC/WACC 1.0x) and upgrade our recommendation."
In early trade on Thursday, Ryanair shares were trading at (EURO)13.51 on Euronext Dublin, up 5.1%.

Ryanair splits opinion in City despite busiest December since pandemic

Analysts remain cautious over Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) as passenger stats for December fell slightly short 
of market expectations despite reaching levels last seen prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Traffic numbers were some 2.6% higher than December 2019, at 11.2mln passengers, spanning some 65,500 
flights. Year-on-year comparison makes more impressive reading, as the monthly number comes in 21% above last 
December which was impacted by the Omicron variant of Covid.
Nevertheless, compiled with October and November volumes it leaves the low-cost airline short of analyst 
expectations for the final calendar quarter of 2022, and, looking into the airline's fourth fiscal quarter it now has 
some catching up to do if it is to reach its own targets for the year.
"The passenger figures for the quarter were slightly light of our forecast at 38.4mln (vs. our 40.5mln estimate), 
although that could imply a stronger fourth than we had assumed to reach management's 168mln target for the year 
to March 2023," Liberum Capital analyst Gerald Khoo said in a note.
"We retain a cautious stance with current consensus implying a double-digit percentage average fare improvement 
next FY, which strikes us as challenging in a likely recessionary environment.
Peel Hunt analyst Alexander Paterson, meanwhile, said: "This [target] should be achievable as long as there are no 
travel restrictions or sustained periods of bad weather."
At (EURO)12.475, Ryanair shares are down by slightly in Wednesday morning's dealing, and, remain off some 4% 
since early December.

Liberum retains a 'hold' rating for the airline's shares with its target price set at (EURO)13, whilst Peel Hunt by 
comparison is more bullish with its target pitched at (EURO)18 per share and its recommendation set as 'buy'.

A rise in passenger figures from Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) for December were actually lower than expected 
and imply the need for a "cautious stance" on the airline's shares, according to analysts.
The low-cost airline flew some 11.5mln passengers in December, a 21% increase on the 9.5mln carried in the last 
month of 2021.
November saw passenger numbers increase by 10%, according to an update released today.
But rather than an impressive resurgence, analysts at Liberum suggested the figures were lighter than expected, 
reflecting a comparatively weaker month a year earlier.

The figures from the same month in 2021 were impacted by the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID and a 
resurgence in international travel restrictions, said Liberum, adding that Ryanair's third quarter figures of 38.4mln 
were below forecasts.
The broker had anticipated 40.5mln passengers would travel with the airline during the quarter but suggested "that 
could imply a stronger fourth quarter than we had assumed" given Ryanair's traffic guidance of 168mln passengers 
for the full year.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC late on Wednesday raised its full-year profit guidance on a strong 
performance over the Christmas and New Year's Eve period.
The Dublin-based low-cost airline said that it expects a stronger-than-expected third-quarter performance, due to 
strong pent-up travel demand over the holiday season. 
The company noted that no damage from Covid or the war in Ukraine lead to strong Christmas and New Year traffic 
and fares. Ryanair's third quarter ends on December 31.
The firm now expects full-year post-tax profit in the range of EUR1.33 billion to EUR1.43 billion, up from an initial 
forecast of 1 billion to 1.2 billion euros.
For the third quarter that ended on December 31, it expects to report post-tax profit of as close to EUR200 million. 
However, the budget airline noted in a statement that the reassessment was "heavily dependent" on avoiding 
further fallout from "adverse events" such as Covid or the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Earlier on Wednesday, Ryanair said its December traffic rose 21% to 11.5 million guests from 9.5 million in 
December 2021.
The load factor improved to 92% from 81% a year earlier.
On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers more than doubled to 160.4 million guests from a year ago and 
load factor the load factor rose to 92%, from 81%. 
It will publish its third-quarter results on January 30.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday reported it carried more passengers in December 
compared to a year earlier.
The Dublin-based low-cost airline said its December traffic rose 21% to 11.5 million guests from 9.5 million in 
December 2021. 
The load factor improved to 92% from 81% a year earlier. 
On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers more than doubled to 160.4 million guests from a year ago and 
load factor the load factor rose to 92%, from 81%. 
The announcement came days after Ryanair cabin crews launched a three-day strike over the New Year holiday, 
grounding dozens of flights and hitting thousands of passengers. 
The industrial action came as the cost of living crisis spurs growing labour strife across Europe that has disrupted 
the festive period.
Charleroi airport Chief Executive Philippe Verdonck told AFP that the strike action would set to halt 30% of the 
airlines' flights through its Belgium hub. 
Overall, some 22,000 passengers were expected to be affected over the three days, he said. 
In early December, Ryanair said it carried 11.2 million passengers in November 2022, up 9.8% from 10.2 million a 
year earlier, and up 2.8% from 10.9 million in November 2019.

Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair is expecting a higher annual profit than expected after a surprisingly strong 
third quarter.
After taxes and adjusted for special items, the company announced on Wednesday that it expects to post a profit of 
(EURO)1.325 to 1.425 billion ($1.5 billion) if no negative events follow.
Previously, Ryanair had assumed a figure of (EURO)1 to 1.2 billion.
The company still expects 168 million passengers for the financial year ending on 30 March.
A profit of just under (EURO)200 million is likely to have been achieved in the third quarter, the Irish firm added. A 
strong pent-up demand from customers was noted in the holiday season as the majority of coronavirus restrictions 
in Europe were abolished.

3.1 million flights up on 2021, but still 1.9 million down on 2019, Eurocontrol says in its 2022 analysis paper[1]. The 
organization sees further recovery in 2023, but that won't come without issues. Air travel Europe recovers but 
punctuality suffers. 
Eurocontrol[2] notes that the recovery of the number of flights from 70 percent at the beginning of 2022 to on 
average 83 percent at the end is in some way remarkable, given that the first months were dominated by the 
downturn caused by the Omicron virus. And then, at the end of February, Russia started the war in Ukraine, which 
affected airspace in some parts of Europe. But the effects of both crises were rather limited and traffic already hit 86 
percent in May and remained between 86-88 percent for the rest of the year.

European airlines carried a combined two billion passengers last year. The busiest carrier by the umber of daily 
departures and arrivals was, as in 2019, Ryanair, with 2.536 daily flights. This is up nine percent on 2019 or 77.000 
flights over the full year. easyJet was runner-up with 1.335 flights, but this is twenty percent down on 2019. Turkish 
Airlines came third with 1.245 flights (-7 percent) and outpaced Lufthansa, which operated 158.000 fewer flights 
largely due to strikes last summer. Air France is in the fifth spot, ahead of KLM, whereas British Airways dropped 
two places in the listing, behind Wizz Air ahead of subsidiary Vueling and SAS. Wizz saw a fourteen percent 
increase in the number of flights, or 30.000 extra. 
'Lufthansa, Air France, and KLM, as traditional mainline carriers reliant on a hub model, have recovered slower than 
their low-cost counterparts. In particular, Lufthansa (-29 percent versus 2019) has seen a very weak recovery in 
German internal demand, with a rise in alternative methods of travel or reduced business travel by air', the 
Eurocontrol report notes.

Delays 
But as the year progressed, the more serious became staffing issues at airports and air navigation services 
providers across Europe. Flights departed on average 17.6 minutes late by the end of the year, up from 13.1 
minutes in 2019. 'Arrival schedule delay (actual arrival time compared with scheduled arrival time) increased to 16.9 
Air travel Europe recovers but punctuality suffers
min/flight from 12.7 min/flight in 2019 (+33 percent). Departure schedule delay was also up to 19.6 min/flight in 
2022, rising from 15.3 min/flight in 2019.' 
As a result, punctuality suffered: arrival punctuality was on average 71.7 percent, down 6.4 percent from 2019. 
Departure punctuality dripped by even 6.8 percent to 65.9 percent. During the summer peak, punctuality dropped to 
between 50-60 percent. Of the delay, on average 2.17 minutes was caused by air traffic management issues 
andATM inefficiencies.[3] 
In the top ten of most punctual European airlines, Vueling is in the top spot, followed by SAS (despite or maybe 
even thanks to the long summer strike), KLM, and Ryanair, while Wizz Air is in the top ten position with punctuality 
between 50 and 60 percent. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-02-4.png?ssl=1 
The busiest airport in Europe was Istanbul, which saw 1.156 daily flights. Despite the capacity cap that has been in 
place since June, Amsterdam Schiphol is closely behind with on average of 1.140 daily flights, which is just 
eighteen flights more than Paris Charles de Gaulle. 
Eurocontrol also looked at the status of carbon dioxide emissions. Between January and November 2022, these 
were 19.6 percent lower compared to 2019 at 15.1 percent fewer departures. Excess fuel burn was between 3.1 
and 6.1 percent, well below the seven to eight percent in 2019. The report notes that long-haul flights, which 
account for 5.5 percent of all flights, are responsible for 43.9 percent of all emissions. Short- to medium-haul flights 
(share 43 percent) cause 23.2 percent of emissions. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-02-3.png?ssl=1 
Outlook 
In its outlook for 2023, Eurocontrol expects air travel in Europe to further recover to 92 percent but not return to full 
pre-Covid levels until 2025. This is one year later than it the June forecast and takes the weak economic growth, 
inflation, and the continuation of the war in Ukraine into account. 
'However, 2023 is set to be the most challenging year of the last decade. Keeping summer delays down will be an 
immense task for all actors, with airspace issues due to the Ukraine war, new aircraft delivered, possible industrial 
action, system changes and the progressive reopening of Asian markets all asking real questions of the system.'

Supply squeeze extends to used aircraft

Airlines and lessors are facing supply chain delays for used aircraft as demand soars from airlines responding to a 
rebound in bookings, according to a panel at Airfinance Journal's Dublin 2023 event. 
"The placement market for used equipment is not immune to supply chain issues," says Steven Udvar-Hazy, senior 
vice president and chief procurement officer of Aviation Capital Group.
"We've experienced challenges, especially as we've transitioned an airplane out of an operator, and when we 
needed to make some interior modifications for the next operator. You can hit bottlenecks in getting components, 
MRO slots and even engineering work can be challenging in this environment.
"These bottlenecks in the supply chain are holding up our ability to transition the airplane as efficiently and quickly 
as we like," he says.
The increase in demand for used aircraft means airlines can no longer rely on their supply to meet evolving flight 
schedules.
"As an airline, we try to enter opportunistic deals available on the market, and used aircraft used to be the platform 
that was relatively easily available. That's no longer the case," says Maciej Dziudzik, director of fleet LOT Polish 
Airlines.
Steve Mason, former head of OEM relations at Avolon, stresses the importance of aircraft supply for airlines in a 
post-pandemic operating environment.
"European airlines are in a really competitive environment. If you think of some of these airlines, such as Ryanair, if 
you don't have your aircraft, they will come and eat your lunch. You have to get seats and protect your markets.
"Airlines are in a fight. They will lose market share and that will ultimately have a long-term effect on their business."
Flybe, which collapsed into administration for the second time in two years, previously blamed an aircraft shortage 
for a series of disruptions over the summer months. 
Supply squeeze extends to used aircraft
In July, the airline's chief executive, Dave Pflieger, noted that two leasing companies were responsible flight 
cancellations. The move, he said in a statement, would affect schedules from 28 July until the end of the summer 
season on 29 October.
He said at the time: "We were planning to increase flights...However the two aircraft leasing companies who were 
contracted to provide our additional airplanes have now told us that they will be unable to fulfil their commitments 
until after the summer."
He added: "We were able to find and rent aircraft from two separate airlines in Greece and Spain, but those planes 
are not enough, and the lack of additional aircraft needed for new flying means we need to adjust our future flight 
schedule.
"As a result, we are reducing our planned increase in flying for the period."
Avolon has also weighed in on supply chain constraints in a recent white paper, saying delays have become 
"endemic" and an aircraft shortage is emerging given the lost production of 2,400 aircraft (1,700 single-aisle, 700 
widebody) that had been planned but were not built due to the pandemic.
"As traffic flows rebound, the absence of new aircraft is increasing supply tension, supporting long-term residual 
values," Avolon said.
Airbus and Boeing plan to produce a combined 140 narrowbody and 24 widebody aircraft per month by 2025. 
However, Avolon believes the manufacturers will need to delay production increases for a year to focus on 
"delivering to schedule and quality versus aspiration".

Ryanair may see $200m profit boost

Ryanair is guiding for a stronger than expected third quarter, to 31 December 2022, as a result of strong pent-up 
demand over the winter holiday season.
The European low-cost airline group is predicting profit after tax of (EURO)200 million ($212 million) for the three-
month period.
As a result, the company has raised its fiscal-year 2023 profit after tax guidance from a range of (EURO)1 billion to 
(EURO)1.2 billion to (EURO)1.325 billion to (EURO)1.425 billion, although this remains dependent upon avoiding 
adverse events, Ryanair said in a statement.
Ryanair still expects Q4 to be loss-making due to the absence of Easter from March, and a recent softening in 
pricing.
In November 2022, Ryanair said it aimed to repay (EURO)1.6 billion of maturing bonds while returning its balance 
sheet to a broadly zero net debt position over the next year.
In the same month the carrier reported total liquidity of (EURO)4.6 billion, including (EURO)1.7 billion of cash and 
cash equivalents, (EURO)2.8 billion of financial assets convertible to cash after three months, as well as (EURO)23 
million of restricted cash.
Net debt was reduced to (EURO)546 million at the end of September versus (EURO)1.5 billion at 31 March, despite 
(EURO)900 million of capital expenditure in the first six months of fiscal-year 2023.
Gross debt increased by (EURO)60 million to (EURO)5 billion, primarily due to the extension of operating lease 
terms on 24 Airbus A320 aircraft until 2028 at lower rentals, offset by debt repayments during the period.

Ryanair Group recorded a net profit of (EURO)211 million ($230 million) for the three months ended 31 December 
2022, swinging from a loss of (EURO)96 million in the prior-year period and up from the (EURO)88 million profit in 
the October-December period in 2019 on the back of strong demand and fares.
Revenue increased 57% year-on-year to (EURO)2.3 billion, outpacing a 36% rise in operating costs to (EURO)2.2 
billion.
Fuel costs rose 52% to (EURO)900 million, offset by the introduction of Boeing 737 Max 8200 aircraft improving fuel 
efficiency. Ex-fuel operating costs rose by 26%, marginally ahead of traffic with year-to-date unit costs at (EURO)30 
per passenger.  
The company achieved a nine-percentage point increase in load factor to 93% for the third quarter.
Ryanair is expecting a "reasonably strong" Easter and summer season in 2023 but expects the fourth quarter of 
fiscal-year 2023 to be loss making due to the absence of Easter from March.
"Absent any negative news flows around Covid or Ukraine, it is very reasonable that we will have a second summer 
of rising fares because we will have materially higher oil prices," said Ryanair Group chief executive officer Michael 
O'Leary on an earnings call.
"Where do I think yields will be this summer? I honestly don't know but they will be stronger, up mid-to-high single 
digits from where they were in summer 2022 but it is still too early to say," O'Leary continued.
He noted that the strength of the balance sheet differentiates it from other European competitors.
"We'll be very busy over the next 12 months repaying the (EURO)1.6 billion of maturing bonds this year but we will 
use cash resources to pay that down."
"We will not refinance those bonds. Were we to try to refinance them, even with our strong investment grade rating 
and balance sheet, we would be looking at financing costs of 4.5-5% in the current environment.
Ryanair posts $230m net profit
"We have the resources to pay down that debt and fund capex - many of our competitors have exited Covid doing a 
lot of sale and leasebacks. The cost of those operating leases will go up meaningfully this year as interest rates go 
up whereas we will be paying off debt and 98% of our fleet is unencumbered.
"That will be a significant differentiator on the unit cost side between us and everybody else," O'Leary concluded.
Net debt at 31 December 2022 was (EURO)1 billion, down from (EURO)1.5 billion as of 31 March 2021, while cash 
amounted to (EURO)4.1 billion at the end of the quarter.

On the back of Ryanair Group's strong third-quarter results, chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said the 
company would still consider future Boeing 737 Max 10 or even Airbus deals as it looks to widen its cost advantage 
versus its European competitors.
"It's entirely down to pricing and whether there is a material cost per seat advantage," O'Leary said during an 
earnings call.
"We would buy whichever aircraft has the cheaper cost per seat. I would always take a bigger aircraft as long as I'm 
getting a better price per seat."
He noted the company would be willing to look at the Max 10 when it gets certified and when Boeing is able to 
deliver it, and as long as it offers a reasonable discount on the additional 30 seats that come with the extended 
narrowbody.
"We're back talking to Boeing on new aircraft orders but not in any serious way and don't expect anything significant 
to occur for at least a few months.
"Would we look at an Airbus order? Yes, we would, but it again comes down to being opportunistic. Airbus has a 
much longer orderbook than Boeing and have capitalised on Boeing's 737 Max delays and Airbus is a beneficiary of 
trade wars between China and the US.
"The Boeing orderbook is much weaker... so Airbus is pricing up materially which is good for us since most of our 
competitors are Airbus operators and are paying much higher prices for aircraft than we are for our Boeing orders."
O'Leary said the vast majority of Ryanair's growth will come from its Boeing orderbook rather than temporary 
leases. The carrier is looking to take delivery of at least 45 new 197-seat 737 Max 8200s by this summer.
"We're not usually searching for second hand aircraft, given that the Boeing 737 Max aircraft are coming in at a 
more predictable rate right now," O'Leary continued.
"We're not out actively looking for additional leased aircraft. We are receiving offers though and if they are 
financially and opportunistically interesting we will follow up on them up.
Ryanair to be opportunistic on future orders: O'Leary
"At the moment we have more than 120 aircraft to deliver over the next three years and so most of the growth will 
come from these fuel-efficient aircraft."

Ryanair is looking to incorporate another 50 Boeing 737 Max 8200s for fiscal year 2024, Thomas Fowler's director 
of sustainability and finance has said on the sidelines of Airfinance Journal's Dublin 2023 conference.
The company expects capital expenditure of around (EURO)2 billion ($2.2 billion) for the period, with Fowler noting 
that the company will rely on strong liquidity that it maintained during the Covid-19 pandemic for Capex.
"Our cash position put us in good stead during the pandemic," Fowler says. "We'll mostly be using cash to finance 
deliveries."
"Our focus over the next year is the repayment of (EURO)1.6 billion of maturing bonds, including (EURO)850 
million maturing in March and another (EURO)750 million in August," Fowler adds.
The carrier reported total liquidity of (EURO)4.6 billion as of 30 September, including (EURO)1.7 billion of cash and 
cash equivalents, (EURO)2.8 billion of financial assets convertible to cash after three months, as well as (EURO)23 
million of restricted cash.

Malaysian-based World Cargo Airlines has incorporated a third Boeing 737-800 converted freighter.
The aircraft is currently in storage at Kuala Lumpur's Subang airport.
The 2005-vintage aircraft is managed by BBAM and was acquired by Incline Aviation from Ryanair in 2021, 
according to Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker.
World Cargo Airlines operates another two 737-800 Boeing converted freighters (BCF), both also managed by 
BBAM, as well as one 747-400C, according to Fleet Tracker.
Last August, Incline Aviation and BBAM supported the launch of dedicated Vietnamese cargo carrier IPP Air Cargo 
with one 2004-vintage 737-800 converted freighter also acquired from Ryanair.
Three additional 737-800 freighters for IPP Air Cargo are expected to be delivered over time.

Airlines have been the perennial recovery stocks of the past three years.
Since the start of 2021 pundits have confidently been calling that this would be the year in which the carriers finally 
got over their Covid hangover and start growing again.
Alas, the reality has been a lot trickier and come the start of 2023 investors in airlines are still yet to see a return to 
anywhere near the share price levels of 2019.
Timing though is critical in investing hence airlines again are featuring heavily in many tips of the year lists.
A reason is that while share prices might be lagging behind pre-covid levels, at the operational level things are 
looking much brighter.
All of the listed airlines IAG (British Airways,) Ryanair, EasyJet, Jet2 and WizzAir have issued bullish updates in 
recent months driven by better passenger numbers and higher capacity levels but also pricing.
Ryanair is the European leader and posted a pre-tax profit of (EURO)1.4bn (£1.2bn) in the six months to the end of 
September following a net loss of (EURO)48m in the same period last year.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said "Concerns about the impact of recession and rising consumer price inflation 
on Ryanair's business model have been greatly exaggerated."
Hope springs again for British Airways , easyJet , Ryanair as passengers return
O'Leary added he expects the airline "to grow strongly in a recession as consumers won't stop flying, but rather 
they will become more price sensitive."
Ryanair flew 95mln passengers in its first half, up from 39mln a year earlier and 11% more than the 85.7mln in the 
same period in 2019 before Covid grounded almost all air travel.
While the Irish carrier is ahead of its rivals in getting passenger numbers back, the trend is consistent.
British Airways' owner IAG said fourth-quarter capacity is expected to be approximately 87% of 2019 with the first 
quarter of 2023 expected to be approximately 95% of pre-Covid levels.
"Leisure demand is particularly healthy and leisure revenue has recovered to pre-pandemic levels," noted chief 
executive Luis Gallego.
"Business travel continues to recover steadily," he added, though this was before the US "bomb cyclone".
All encouraging, especially with new more efficient planes on the way and fuel prices starting to turn down, but like 
Ryanair ((EURO)11.22), IAG's share price (129p) has refused to go anywhere this year.
Possibly it's due to caution after the previous false dawns but TUI gave a clue as to why it might still be a little early 
to back the sector.
In an update in December, the travel group said it expected a "solid and a good year in 2023" with prices for the 
winter season up 28%.
Sebastian Ebel, the group's new chief executive, even went as far as to say "We have surmounted the existential 
crisis [Covid], it's behind us."
Maybe, but some legacies remain and in almost the same statement TUI confirmed it was planning a rights issue in 
the New Year to raise between (EURO)1.6-1.8bn.
That will clear the bailouts received from the German government at the start of the pandemic.
And there's the rub. TUI is unlikely to be an exception and there is a nagging feeling that as soon as share prices 
allow other airlines won't be shy about raising funds.
IAG, for example, has net debt of around (EURO)11bn even though its boasts "strong liquidity" while easyJet's 
debts are £700mln.
Even Ryanair, seen as the strongest of the airline bunch, was carrying debt of (EURO)500mln at its last showing.
Perhaps the best bet for the sector, therefore, is consolidation. WizzAir has already approached easyJet about a 
potential merger and possibly as a defensive measure.
EasyJet has also reportedly attracted the attention of IAG and at a conference earlier in the year Gallego hinted that 
the BA, Vueling and Iberia owner was mulling its expansion options.
"We are a platform for consolidation. We will only do what makes sense but we see there are opportunities to be 
stronger. We are a group that wants to consolidate the industry," he said.
Ryanair too is expected to be involved as a buyer if, or more likely when, any shake-out occurs.
So for those looking for an airline sector recovery story this year, the angle might be to overlook the strong and go 
for the least obvious as that's where the takeover action could be.

(Alliance News) - Belgian-based Ryanair Holdings PLC cabin crews on Friday launched a three-day strike over the 
New Year holiday, grounding dozens of flights and hitting thousands of passengers. 
The industrial action comes as the cost of living crisis spurs growing labour strife across Europe that has disrupted 
the festive period.
Charleroi airport CEO Philippe Verdonck told AFP 48 outgoing and incoming Ryanair flights had been cancelled on 
Friday, with the action set to halt 30% of the airlines' flights through its Belgium hub. 
Overall some 22,000 passengers were expected to be affected over the three days, he said. 
The low-cost Irish carrier has 15 planes in Belgium and the strike was not due to impact its aircraft based in other 
countries. 
Ryanair employees in Belgium have already gone on strike several times this year to demand that the country's 
labour laws be fully applied, grounding aircraft.
The unions notably accused Ryanair of illegally pressuring staff in Belgium to work from time to time in other sites 
across Europe, particularly in its home base Dublin, where the airline suffers employee shortages.
They also allege Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline in terms of passengers transported, is not properly declaring 
salaries to Belgian social security authorities and sometimes paying wages under the national legal minimum.
The unions are also planning to strike over the weekend of January 7 and 8 at the end of Belgium's traditional 
winter break.
Ryanair shares fell 0.7% to EUR12.10 each in Frankfurt on Friday afternoon.

Dec 30, 2022( The Hindu Business Line: http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 STATES Full recovery. 'India is top among 5 markets closest to achieving 2019 capacity' Indian carriers operated 
2,919 domestic flights, over 93.14 per cent of the approved schedule, on December 29, highest since the re-start 
post-Covid , according to Network Thoughts' analysis. 
According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation's (MoCA) data, over 4,15,314 passengers flew on 2,919 flights. The total 
flight movements were 5,833. 
Load factor 
Air India's flights were 90.5 per cent full. SpiceJet's were at 89.9 per cent, Vistara's at 88.8 per cent, Go First 86.7 
per cent and Air Asia India's was 85.9 percent. IndiGo's passenger load factor was 81.4 per cent and Akasa Air's at 
81.8 per cent. 
Cumulatively they carried 4,35,500 passengers post-Covid on December 24, 2022. This was the highest number of 
passengers travelled in a day post-Covid. 
Interestingly, Indian carriers are the second in line to add scheduled capacity back since 2019. According to 
aviation consultancy OAG's data, at the top twenty country markets, not surprisingly, the US leads the chart with 
just over 1 billion seats this year, a staggering 56 per cent up on 2021 capacity although still 7 per cent below the 
2019 high tide mark. 
Low-cost sector 
'There are in total five country markets that are within touching distance of their 2019 capacity, the closest is India 
at -5.7 per cent and the market certainly has room for further recovery with new aircraft orders being placed and a 
resurgent low-cost sector growing demand (although several operational challenges remain around aircraft spare 
parts and resources),' it said. 
In 2019, Indian airlines had 211,423,887 seats, which dipped to 127,490,029 in 2020. In 2021, airlines in India 
increased their total seat capacity to 153,419,332. This number has reached close to 199,474,691 in 2022, 
recording a 30 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) rise and a 56 per cent rise since 2020. However, it is still lagging by 5.7 
per cent to reach the pre-Covid levels. 
According to OAG, IndiGo is among the three global airlines that are now operating at higher capacity than in 2019. 
Ryanair is at +12 per cent of pre-Covid, Indigo, too, is at +12 per cent and Spirit Airlines is at +17 per cent. On a y-
o-y basis, IndiGo added a capacity of 37.7 per cent and a 77 per cent rise since 2020.

Dec 30, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belgium-based Ryanair cabin crews have started a three-day strike, resulting in dozens of the low-cost Irish 
carrier's flights being grounded and affecting thousands of passengers. 
The strike came on Friday as the cost of living crisis continued, increasing labour strife across Europe that has 
disrupted the festive period. 
Ryanair employees in Belgium have already gone on strike several times this year to demand that the country's 
labour laws be fully applied, grounding aircraft. 
The labour unions have notably accused Ryanair of illegally pressuring staff in Belgium to work from time to time in 
other sites across Europe, particularly in its home base Dublin, where the airline suffers employee shortages. 
They also allege Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline in terms of passengers transported, is not properly declaring 
salaries to Belgian social security authorities and is sometimes paying wages under the national legal minimum. 
Charleroi airport CEO Philippe Verdonck said 48 outgoing and incoming Ryanair flights had been cancelled on 
Friday, expecting the strike to halt 30 percent of the airlines' flights through its Belgium hub. 
Overall, about 22,000 passengers were expected to be affected over the three days, he added. 
Ryanair has 15 planes in Belgium and the strike was not due to affect its aircraft based in other countries. 
The unions are also planning to strike over the weekend of January 7 and 8 at the end of Belgium's traditional 
winter break.

Dec 29, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Southwest Airlines LUV[1]was the chief newsmaker, albeit for wrong reasons. The Dallas-based 
carrier was the worst affected U.S. airline in terms of flight cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions 
during the Christmas holiday weekend. Meanwhile, United Airlines UAL[2] management decided to resume 
operations to Tokyo from Denver. This route was suspended when the pandemic was wreaking havoc. Recap of 
the Latest Top Stories 1Southwest Airlines canceled 62% of its flights on Dec 27. What is worse is that LUV's rivals 
have seen their operations being disrupted at a much lower scale. We note that LUV is the biggest carrier serving 
Buffalo, NY, the hardest-hit urban area by this natural catastrophe. Management has apologized to passengers for 
the harassment they had to face due to the disruption in operations. The disruption is likely to hit LUV's fourth-
quarter 2022 performance. Many market watchers believe that it will take around a week for LUV to recover from 
this fiasco of gigantic proportions. 
LUV was also in the news recently when the union, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 
covering its customer service employees, ratified a pay-related deal. That story was covered in the previous week's 
write-up[3]. 
2. UAL will resume operating non-stop flights from Denver to Tokyo from Mar 4, 2023. Return flights from Tokyo's 
Narita International Airport to Denver International Airport will start taking to the skies from Mar 5, 2023. Initially, the 
service will be available three times a week. Flights will depart from Denver to Tokyo on Monday, Thursday and 
Saturday. Return flights to Denver will take to the skies on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Flights on the route will 
operate daily from Mar 25, 2023[4]. UAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3. Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] along with the likes of Wizz Air and easyJet, will reportedly[7] face an inquiry by anti-
trust authorities in Italy over allegations of price-fixing. The allegations surfaced for flights operated by the airlines in 
and out of Sicily. The enquiry is expected to be completed by 2023-end.A complaint of price-fixing lodged by 
consumer group Codacons has led to the investigation. 
4. With COVID-19 cases on the rise in China, the United States has announced that passengers coming to the 
country from China, Hong Kong or Macau are required[8] to show negative COVID-19 test reports. The requirement 
will come into force from Jan 5, 2023 and is applicable to passengers above two years. Per the new rule announced 
by the Biden administration, passengers traveling to the United States directly from China and also those who were

in thecountry 10 days beforetheir departure to the United States will have to take a COVID-19 test (no more than 
two days before travel) and furnish a negative report before boarding the flight. Performance The following table 
shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
inched down 3.1% to $51.16 over the past week. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 10.3%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual updates in the space.

 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

 European shares were subdued on Wednesday, while UK's FTSE 100 outpaced peers after a long Christmas 
holiday weekend as investors assessed Beijing's steps towards reopening its COVID-battered economy. 
The region-wide STOXX 600 was flat as of 9:31 GMT, while the FTSE 100  <.FTSE > advanced 0.7% as 
commodity-linked and China-exposed stocks jumped in early trading. The UK market, which was closed for 
holidays since its half-day trading on Friday, is playing catch-up, analysts said. 
The FTSE 100 index has benefited this year from its exposure to commodities as prices of oil and base metals have 
rallied amid the Russia-Ukraine war. 
"The UK index could end the year in positive territory despite the broad pressures on global equity markets, 
weighed down by rising interest rates, inflation, and the threat of recession," said Victoria Scholar, head of 
investment at Interactive Investor. 
Miners jumped 1.0% as copper prices rallied on hopes of a demand recovery in the world's second-largest 
economy after China further eased its stringent COVID curbs on Monday. 
London-listed financials exposed to China such as insurer Prudential and HSBC added 2.6% and 1.3%, 
respectively.  
Meanwhile, STOXX 600 was headed for an annual loss of 12.2% as concerns about an economic recession due to 
aggressive monetary policy tightening by central banks globally weighed on the European index. 
The technology sector weighed on STOXX 600 on Wednesday, tracking the overnight fall in U.S. peers as rising 
yields pressured the interest rate sensitive shares, a recurring theme this year.  
Tech shares have fallen nearly 28.4% so far in 2022.  
Germany's Infineon fell 1.1% amid broader tech moves and after Chief Executive Jochen Hanebeck said it is ready 
to spend several billion euros on the right takeover target as it searches for acquisitions. 
Ireland's stock market  <.ISEQ >, which was also closed since its half-day trading on Friday, slipped 0.1%.  
Traders and analysts said thin trading volumes also influenced market moves. 
China-exposed luxury firms extended gains, with Kering and Richemont rising 0.2% and 0.8%, respectively.  
Italy's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it had opened an inquiry into possible price-fixing for flights in and out of 
Sicily by airlines including Ryanair, Wizz Air and easyJet. Shares of the airlines fell between 1.2% and 2%. 
European Shares Muted, UK Outperforms As China-exposed Stocks Jump
"2022 was meant to be the year of the comeback for international travel with a major pick-up in demand post 
pandemic," added Scholar.  
"However there have been serious challenges with baggage handling, cancellations, the war in Ukraine, strikes and 
general disruption which have prompted these stocks to slide year-to-date, resulting in another difficult year for the 
airline industry." 
EasyJet denied any wrongdoing in a statement to Reuters.

Italy's antitrust authority (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato - AGCM) has opened an investigation 
into a possible distortion of competition, claiming that some airlines had deliberately raised airfares on routes linking 
mainland Italy with Sicily, the institution revealed on December 23.
The AGCM said it was acting on a complaint from the Sicily branch of the consumer group Codacons, which had 
alleged that flights to the island operated by Ryanair, Wizz Air, easyJet, and ITA Airways from Rome (Rome 
Fiumicino and Rome Ciampino), Milan (Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, and Milan Bergamo), Bologna, and Turin had 
been raised for no apparent reason during the Christmas holidays.
Codacons Sicilia had made its allegations on December 13, deeming that any deliberate price distortions "would be 
particularly serious in the context of the current crisis, of difficulties for consumers and households' declining 
spending power," as quoted by the newspaper l'Eco del Sud.
The investigation will have "a particular reference to economy-class flights" to Palermo or Catania, in violation of 
Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), an article prohibiting trade practices 
which could prevent, restrict, or distort competition.
To reach Sicily, Codacons claimed, a passenger must pay the most expensive prices within Italy - from Bologna or 
Turin to Palermo at least EUR300 euros (USD320), EUR400 (USD426) from Milan, and up to EUR500 (USD533) 
from Rome.
The opening of the investigation has also been welcomed positively by Assoutenti, another consumer rights group, 
which had found in its own survey in mid-December that a one-way ticket from Rome to Palermo departing on 
December 21 cost EUR370 (USD394), EUR254 (USD270) on December 23, and as much as EUR511 (USD544) 
on December 20 - more than Rome-New York JFK, which cost EUR459 (USD489) on the latter date.
"Spending on airline tickets is particularly high this Christmas, and not only because of the very heavy price 
increases in the sector, which have risen on an annual basis by 80% for domestic flights," said Furio Truzzi, 
president of Assoutenti. "In fact, there is a suspicion of speculation and anti-competitive phenomena that exploit 
most of the departures of citizens during the holidays to increase the earnings of the airlines. For this reason, we 
hope that the antitrust investigation will clarify and punish any unfair practices to the detriment of users."
Rome probes Ryanair , EasyJet , Wizz, ITA on Sicily flights
The airlines have rejected the insinuations, with easyJet for example telling the business daily Il Sole 24 Ore: "We 
are aware of the investigation launched by the AGCM against some airlines operating in Italy, including easyJet. 
We firmly reject these disputes, confirming that we have always operated in compliance with the laws and 
regulations on the matter. [easyJet] will collaborate in full transparency with the authorities in order to demonstrate 
that it has always acted lawfully in compliance with the rules of competition and in the best interests of consumers."
According to the ch-aviation capacities module, easyJet currently operates 11 domestic Italian routes, of which two 
are to Catania (29x weekly from Milan Malpensa and 10x weekly from Naples Capodichino) and two from the same 
airports to Palermo (22x and 6x weekly, respectively). Ryanair operates 103 routes within Italy, with 14 to Catania 
(among them Fiumicino 42x weekly, Malpensa 26x, Bergamo 24x, Bologna 23x and Turin 12x) and 16 to Palermo

Italy's antitrust authority (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato - AGCM) has opened an investigation 
into a possible distortion of competition, claiming that some airlines had deliberately raised airfares on routes linking 
mainland Italy with Sicily, the institution revealed on December 23.
The AGCM said it was acting on a complaint from the Sicily branch of the consumer group Codacons, which had 
alleged that flights to the island operated by Ryanair, Wizz Air, easyJet, and ITA Airways from Rome (Rome 
Fiumicino and Rome Ciampino), Milan (Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, and Milan Bergamo), Bologna, and Turin had 
been raised for no apparent reason during the Christmas holidays.
Codacons Sicilia had made its allegations on December 13, deeming that any deliberate price distortions "would be 
particularly serious in the context of the current crisis, of difficulties for consumers and households' declining 
spending power," as quoted by the newspaper l'Eco del Sud.
The investigation will have "a particular reference to economy-class flights" to Palermo or Catania, in violation of 
Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), an article prohibiting trade practices 
which could prevent, restrict, or distort competition.
To reach Sicily, Codacons claimed, a passenger must pay the most expensive prices within Italy - from Bologna or 
Turin to Palermo at least EUR300 euros (USD320), EUR400 (USD426) from Milan, and up to EUR500 (USD533) 
from Rome.
The opening of the investigation has also been welcomed positively by Assoutenti, another consumer rights group, 
which had found in its own survey in mid-December that a one-way ticket from Rome to Palermo departing on 
December 21 cost EUR370 (USD394), EUR254 (USD270) on December 23, and as much as EUR511 (USD544) 
on December 20 - more than Rome-New York JFK, which cost EUR459 (USD489) on the latter date.
"Spending on airline tickets is particularly high this Christmas, and not only because of the very heavy price 
increases in the sector, which have risen on an annual basis by 80% for domestic flights," said Furio Truzzi, 
president of Assoutenti. "In fact, there is a suspicion of speculation and anti-competitive phenomena that exploit 
most of the departures of citizens during the holidays to increase the earnings of the airlines. For this reason, we 
hope that the antitrust investigation will clarify and punish any unfair practices to the detriment of users."
Rome probes Ryanair , EasyJet , Wizz, ITA on Sicily flights
The airlines have rejected the insinuations, with easyJet for example telling the business daily Il Sole 24 Ore: "We 
are aware of the investigation launched by the AGCM against some airlines operating in Italy, including easyJet. 
We firmly reject these disputes, confirming that we have always operated in compliance with the laws and 
regulations on the matter. [easyJet] will collaborate in full transparency with the authorities in order to demonstrate 
that it has always acted lawfully in compliance with the rules of competition and in the best interests of consumers."
According to the ch-aviation capacities module, easyJet currently operates 11 domestic Italian routes, of which two 
are to Catania (29x weekly from Milan Malpensa and 10x weekly from Naples Capodichino) and two from the same 
airports to Palermo (22x and 6x weekly, respectively). Ryanair operates 103 routes within Italy, with 14 to Catania 
(among them Fiumicino 42x weekly, Malpensa 26x, Bergamo 24x, Bologna 23x and Turin 12x) and 16 to Palermo 
(including from Fiumicino 23x weekly, Bergamo 20x, Malpensa 19x, Bologna 15x and Turin 8x).
Wizz Air operates 18 domestic Italian routes, six of which go to Catania (including 21x weekly from Milan Malpensa, 
14x from Bologna, and 10x from Turin) and two to Palermo (12x weekly from Malpensa and 6x from Venice Marco

 Budget airlines Ryanair (RYA.IR), Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) and EasyJet (EZJ.L) are facing an Italian antitrust 
investigation into accusations of potential price-fixing for flights operating through Sicily, Italy, Reuters reported

collusive will."
The probe is scheduled to close on Dec. 31, 2023, the report added. 
Shares in Ryanair were down almost 2%, Wizz Air gained over 2% and EasyJet's stock rose nearly 1% on

Ryanair strike in Belgium adds to year-end travel woes
Ryanair strike in Belgium adds to year-end travel woes

(Alliance News) - Belgian-based cabin crews of Ryanair Holdings PLC will strike on and around New Year, unions 
said Friday, adding to growing labour strife in Europe that threatens a rocky holiday period for many passengers.
Most of the 450 flight attendants based in Belgium for Ryanair, the low-cost Irish carrier, have been called to stop 
work on December 30, 31 and January 1 – over a New Year's weekend that is expected to be very busy.
They also plan to strike on the following weekend, on January 7 and 8, the CNE and AVC Puls unions said.
The strike will mainly hit Ryanair's Belgium hub at Charleroi airport, south of Brussels, and is likely to cause several 
flight cancellations.
It will affect the 15 planes Ryanair bases in Belgium, CNE permanent secretary Didier Lebbe told AFP, predicting 
that it would halve the number of flights the airline runs into and out of the country.
Ryanair planes based in other countries won't be affected, he said.
Ryanair is Europe's biggest airline in terms of passengers transported.
The announced strike adds to promised travel chaos in Britain and France, where rail workers stopped work on 
Friday and over this Christmas weekend to demand higher wages to offset high inflation. 
British Border Force officers manning passport booths went on strike for the rest of the year, except December 27, 
including up to and including New Year's Eve.
Ryanair employees in Belgium have already gone on strike several times this year to demand that Belgium labour 
laws be fully applied, grounding aircraft.
Ryanair strike in Belgium adds to year-end travel woes
"We want Ryanair to respect Belgian law and stop its aggressive and awful policy towards its own staff," Lebbe 
said, also urging the Belgian government to sue the Irish airline.
The unions notably accused Ryanair of illegally pressuring staff in Belgium to work from time to time in other bases 
across Europe, particularly in Dublin, where the airline suffers employee shortages.
They also allege Ryanair is not properly declaring salaries to Belgian social security authorities and was sometimes 
paying wages under the national legal minimum.
Ryanair shares fell 1.3% to EUR12.59 each on Friday afternoon.

for the airline to abide by domestic laws. 
"We want Ryanair to respect Belgian law and stop its aggressive and awful policy towards its own staff," CNE 
permanent secretary Didier Lebbe told AFP on Friday. 
The strike will include majority of the company's 450 flight attendants, and it is expected to be followed by another 
strike action on Jan. 7-8, 2023.

Ryanair Holdings PLC - Dublin-based low-cost airline - Signs a four-year pay deal with the Forsa union and its Irish 
pilots under which Ryanair's Irish pilots will receive a restoration of pay cuts agreed during the Covid-19 pandemic 
in this month's payroll. Says the deal also includes three years of pay increases over four years to March 2027. 
Ryanair People Director Darrell Hughes says: "We welcome this pay restoration agreement with Forsa and our Irish 
pilots which will see pay cuts previously agreed during Covid restored in the Dec payroll in time for Christmas. This 
agreement which includes annual pay increases for the next 4 years now brings our Irish pilots into line with similar 
pay restoration deals concluded with our other pilot unions across Europe over the past 9 months."
Earlier this month, Court of Appeal found in favour of the UK Civil Aviation Authority against Ryanair, deciding that 
strike action by airline staff did not absolve Ryanair of liability for delays and cancellations. As a result, the Court of 
Appeal said Ryanair should provide compensation to passengers affected by a Ryanair pilot strike in 2018.

UK's Civil Aviation Authority slams 'unacceptable' Wizz Air behaviour
UK's Civil Aviation Authority slams 'unacceptable' Wizz Air behaviour
Alliance News UK

(Alliance News) - Wizz Air Holdings PLC has been slammed by UK's aviation regulator for "unacceptable" 
behaviour as its passengers are far more likely to make escalated complaints than those of other airlines.
The Civil Aviation Authority said it has "significant concerns" about the Hungarian airline, which is also delaying 
paying money owed to passengers.
Some 811 grievances per million Wizz Air passengers on UK flights were brought to independent bodies between 
July and September.
With the exception of Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd which had 555 escalated complaints per million passengers, 
the rates for all other airlines were fewer than half of Wizz Air's.
Escalated complaint rates per million passengers at other airlines included easyJet PLC at 245, Ryanair Holdings 
PLC at 235 and International Consolidated Airlines Group SA's British Airways at 166.
The figures relate to complaints taken to either Alternative Dispute Resolution, or ADR, schemes or the CAA by 
passengers unhappy with an airline's response to their initial report of a problem.
Many airlines and airports are members of ADR bodies, which are independent third parties that consider facts and 
make binding decisions.
CAA Head of Consumer Policy & Enforcement Anna Bowles said passengers have "every right" to expect their 
complaints and claims to be resolved "quickly and efficiently", and to be "treated fairly" by airlines.
Wizz Air's delays in processing and paying claims, combined with the "large number" of county court judgments 
made against it, has "raised significant concerns for the CAA", she explained.
UK's Civil Aviation Authority slams 'unacceptable' Wizz Air behaviour
Bowles went on: "We have made it clear to Wizz Air that its behaviour is unacceptable and that we expect overdue 
complaints and claims to be resolved in advance of Christmas.
"We understand the payment of county court judgments may continue into January, but we are encouraging Wizz 
Air to ensure that the payment of these is also prioritised.
"We will continue to monitor the situation."
She added the CAA "won't hesitate to take further action" where it has evidence that an airline is "letting 
passengers down".
Wizz Air said in a statement: "We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience we have caused our customers and we 
are working hard to put things right and resolve all outstanding claims as quickly as possible.
"The major disruption we navigated last summer meant that we have been dealing with an unprecedented number 
of claims.
"Despite this, 91% of claims have already been processed.
"We have recently doubled the size of our customer services team and are working continuously to process all 
outstanding customer claims, Alternative Dispute Resolution claims and settle all county court judgments."
It added that customers pursuing claims should check the spam folders of their email accounts for messages from 
the airline as "this has held up settlement being made in a number of cases".
Wizz Air operates short-haul flights from 10 UK airports including Belfast International, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Gatwick 
and Luton.
Analysis by the PA news agency published in August found that it was the worst airline for flight delays from UK 
airports last year.
The carrier's UK departures were an average of 14 minutes and 24 seconds behind schedule in 2021.
Wizz Air shares fell 4.6% to 2,141.00 pence each on Friday afternoon in London.

easyJet flies lower as Deutsche Bank cuts its rating to 'Sell' from 'Hold'
easyJet flies lower as Deutsche Bank cuts its rating to 'Sell' from 'Hold'

Analysts at Deutsche Bank have downgraded their rating for easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) to 'Sell' from 'Hold' and 
reduced their target price for the budget airline to 330p from 415p in a review of the European transportation sector.
In early trading on Tuesday, easyJet shares were 1% lower at 376.10p.
In the note to clients, the German bank's analysts said: "We think that 2023 could be a volatile year for share prices 
with y-o-y earnings growth likely to bottom in 2Q23 and our DB economists and strategists forecasting a 27% fall in 
the Stoxx 600 in 3Q vs 2Q23.
"Feedback from our annual BLT Conference in London on 22nd November was that investors are generally 
positioned cautiously into the first half of 2023, with the potential to become more bullish in the second."
The analysts pointed out that in March 2022, they downgraded the airlines and freight & logistics sectors from an 
overweight to a neutral/underweight stance.
They said in their latest review: "We remain cautious on the EU Transport sector for the first half of 2023 and our 
top buy picks focus on quality names that we think will emerge from the downturn stronger, those that are able to 
hedge inflation (Vinci), those with flexible costs bases (DSV) and strong balance sheets (Deutsche Post DHL and 
Ryanair)."
"Conversely," the analysts added, "our top sell recommendations easyJet and IDS (International Distributions 
Services PLC) are geared to the UK consumer and have a high degree of operating leverage."

For Royal Mail owner IDS, the Deutsche Bank analysts, however, upped their target price to 160p from 120p while 
reiterating their 'Sell' recommendation.
Among other changes in the note, the Deutsche Bank analysts raised their target price for International Airlines 
Group PLC to 155p from 140p, maintaining a 'Hold' rating on the owner of British Airways and Aer Lingus; they 
upped their target for Wizz Air PLC to 2,550p from 1,950p, also maintaining a 'Hold' rating; and they hiked their 
target price for Ryanair to (EURO)16.0 from (EURO)14.5, while retaining a 'Buy' rating.

Ryanair to compensate passengers for 2018 strikes after dropping appeal

RYANAIR is set to compensate travellers for strikes that took place over four years ago as it dropped a UK 
Supreme Court appeal yesterday.
"Ryanair's decision to discontinue the Supreme Court appeal of the Court of Appeal judgement means that affected 
passengers will now be able to make a claim for compensation," said Paul Smith, consumer director at the Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA).
Passengers across Europe and the UK were hit by delays and disruption over the summer of 2018 after pilots and 
cabin crew members walked out in a dispute over pay and conditions. Despite calls for compensation, the low-cost 
carrier refused to pay customers back citing the disruption had been caused by "extraordinary circumstances." This 
led to a legal battle with the UK aviation regulator, as the CAA undertook enforcement action against Ryanair. The 
row went through two levels of judgement, the
High Court and the Court of Appeal, which reiterated that strike action didn't qualify as an "extraordinary 
circumstance." Nevertheless, Ryanair pressed ahead with its appeal to the Supreme Court until yesterday.
An airline spokesperson said the agreement was reached last month at the end of November.
Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer champion Which?, called on Ryanair to make sure the 
refund was sent to passengers as quickly as possible.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) has decided not to appeal an earlier regulatory decision and will compensate passengers who 
were affected by a strike by its pilots in 2018, the UK Civil Aviation Authority said Monday.
The regulator said that in January, after it took action against the airline, the Court of Appeal decided that the strike 
wasn't an "extraordinary circumstance" but Ryanair was allowed to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
"The Civil Aviation Authority undertook enforcement action against Ryanair due to the belief that strike action by 
airline staff does not constitute an 'extraordinary circumstance' and, as such, affected passengers should be entitled 
to compensation," said the Civil Aviation Authority's Consumer Director Paul Smith.
A Ryanair spokesperson told MT Newswires in an emailed statement that the "Civil Aviation Authority and Ryanair 
reached a settlement on [Nov. 30] to end a legal dispute concerning passenger rights arising from flight 
cancellations caused by union-led strikes in the summer of 2018."
"The resolution reached between Ryanair and the CAA is consistent with a recent ruling of the Court of Justice of 
the EU on union led strikes, ensuring a uniform level of passenger rights across the EU and the UK," the Ryanair 
spokesperson said.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has said it will pay out compensation to consumers hit by strike action in 2018 
after deciding not to appeal a court ruling made earlier this year, according to the UK's Civil Aviation Authority 
(CAA).
In January, following action by the CAA against Ryanair, the Court of Appeal decided that strike action by airline 
staff was not an 'extraordinary circumstance'.
Ryanair had secured permission to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court but said it has decided not to pursue 
this.
In a statement Paul Smith, consumer director at the UK Civil Aviation Authority said: "The Civil Aviation Authority 
undertook enforcement action against Ryanair due to the belief that strike action by airline staff does not constitute 
an 'extraordinary circumstance' and, as such, affected passengers should be entitled to compensation where this 
results in the delay or short notice cancellation of their flight. The judgment by the Court of Appeal supported this 
view."
"Ryanair's decision to discontinue the Supreme Court appeal of the Court of Appeal judgment means that affected 
passengers will now be able to make a claim for compensation from Ryanair if they were impacted by strike action 
taken by Ryanair pilots in 2018 and we would encourage all passengers on flights that were affected to claim the 
compensation they are entitled to," he added.
Ryanair plans to pay compensation after dropping appeal to court ruling
At the time of the disruption, passengers whose short-haul flights to or from UK airports were cancelled within 14 
days of the departure date were entitled to up to (EURO)250 of compensation based on the timings of alternative 
flights offered.

Ryanair decided to drop its attempts to appeal a decision that the pilot strike in 2018 was an extraordinary 
circumstance, paving the way for affected passengers to claim compensation for any flights that were disrupted.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) began enforcement action against the Irish low-cost carrier in December 
2018, as the authority argued that the airline's decision to not pay compensation for its pilots' industrial action in the 
summer of 2018 was illegitimate.
In the end, the CAA announced on December 12, 2022, that affected passengers were now able to claim 
compensation for the period.
Four-year legal proceedings
While the airline attempted to argue that the strike by its flight crews in 2018 did not warrant compensation 
according to European Commission's (EC) regulations, it ultimately lost the case.
The latest development came in January 2022, when the UK Court of Appeal ruled that the industrial action was not 
an extraordinary circumstance. While Ryanair was yet to lose the case as it could have still gone to the UK 
Supreme Court, it decided against it.
"The UK Civil Aviation Authority and Ryanair reached a settlement on 30 November 2022 to end a legal dispute 
concerning passenger rights arising from flight cancellations caused by union-led strikes in the summer of 2018," 
said a Ryanair representative in a statement to AeroTime. "The resolution reached between Ryanair and the CAA is 
consistent with a recent ruling of the Court of Justice of the EU on union-led strikes, ensuring a uniform level of 
passenger rights across the EU and the UK," they added.
Meanwhile, the UK CAA's Consumer Director Paul Smith noted that the authority took on the airline's decision as it 
believed "that strike action by airline staff does not constitute an 'extraordinary circumstance', and as such, affected 
passengers should be entitled to compensation where this results in the delay or short notice cancellation of their 
flight."
"Hell will freeze over before Ryanair unionizes"
Ryanair will pay compensation for 2018 pilot strikes
Ryanair recognized unions for the first time in its corporate history in December 2017, only three months after 
Michael O'Leary, the current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) famously declared that "hell will freeze over before 
Ryanair unionizes".
In July 2018, the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA), a branch of the Ireland-based union Fórsa, went on 
several one-day strikes, stating at the time that they had no "transparent system for the determination of important 
matters, including voluntary/involuntary base transfer/allocation, command upgrade, allocation of annual leave and 
promotion."
Following month-long discussions, a letter from Ryanair's then-Chief People Officer (CPO) Eddie Wilson to Fórsa, 
dated July 30, 2018, noted that the union's strikes the following month would "cause further damage to Ryanair's 
Irish business and jobs." Wilson pointed out that if a fifth strike is called before the two parties' meeting and if the 
union's committee is again going to spend 4 of seven hours "outside the room consulting with Aer Lingus pilots," the 
meeting would not take place.
The two reached an agreement in August 2018. However, before they did, Ryanair's pilots in Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden joined the Irish pilots' industrial action. The 24-hour walkout resulted in around 
400 canceled flights, affecting more than 74,000 passengers.

 Three boys aged eight, 10 and 11 have died and another boy remains in critical condition after they fell into an icy 
lake near Birmingham, central England, police said Monday. 
"Three boys have tragically died after falling into the lake at Babbs Mill Park in Solihull yesterday afternoon," West 
Midlands Police said in a statement. 
The boys suffered cardiac arrest and were rushed to hospital after being pulled from the water. 
"Sadly, they could not be revived and our thoughts are with their family and friends at this deeply devastating time," 
said police. 
"A fourth boy, aged six, remains in a critical condition in hospital." 
Witnesses reported seeing other children on the lake, which froze during a cold snap that has hit swathes of the 
country.  
"Searches of the lake are continuing as we seek to establish exactly what happened and if anyone else fell into the 
water," added police. 
The incident came as the UK was hit by heavy snow and freezing conditions, causing major travel disruption, on the 
eve of a national rail strike Tuesday that was already expected to bring the country to a grinding halt. 
The UK has been experiencing a cold snap for several days, with temperatures dropping to -10 Celsius degrees (14 
Fahrenheit) in some areas, although the Met Office said the temperatures were "not unusual for this time of year".  
The service has issued yellow alerts for snow, fog and frost in several areas, including southeast and southwest 
England, and the north of Scotland. 
London Stansted airport warned of disruption.  
"Our runway is temporarily closed whilst we undertake snow clearing," it said late Sunday, with many flights 
cancelled early Monday. 
The airport later said that the runway was open and fully operational, but that travellers should still brace for delays. 
The airport is a main hub of budget airline Ryanair, which also cautioned about disruption to its flights at Gatwick, 
south of London. 
"Due to ongoing severe snowy weather across the UK, runaways at both Stansted and Gatwick have been 
temporarily closed tonight (11 December), disrupting all flights scheduled to depart Stansted/Gatwick during this 
temporary closure period," it said. 
Three Boys Die After Falling Into Frozen Lake In UK: Police
Dozens of stranded passengers posted videos on social media showing snow-covered runways and planes stuck 
on the ground. 
More than 50 flights were also cancelled on Sunday at Heathrow, the UK's largest airport, due to freezing fog.  
Train and bus services in London were also severely affected after the dump of around four inches (10 centimetres) 
of snow overnight, which also forced the closure of parts of the M25 orbital road around the capital, the country's 
busiest motorway. 
Some schools were also shut.

Ryanair won't appeal Supreme Court decision on passenger compensation
Ryanair won't appeal Supreme Court decision on passenger compensation

(Alliance News) - The UK Civil Aviation Authority on Monday said Ryanair Holdings PLC has decided not to appeal 
a Supreme Court decision on passenger compensation in the case of a pilot strike back in 2018.
The Dublin-based low-cost airline decided against an appeal after initially securing permission to appeal the 
decision by the Court of Appeal in January, according to the regulator, meaning affect passengers now can claim 
compensation.
The Court of Appeal found in favour of the UK CAA's action against Ryanair, deciding that strike action by airline 
staff did not absolve Ryanair of liability. As a result, the Court of Appeal said Ryanair should provide compensation 
to passengers affected by Ryanair pilot strike action in 2018.
"The Civil Aviation Authority undertook enforcement action against Ryanair due to the belief that strike action by 
airline staff does not constitute an 'extraordinary circumstance' and, as such, affected passengers should be entitled 
to compensation where this results in the delay or short notice cancellation of their flight. The judgment by the Court 
of Appeal supported this view," said UK CAA Consumer Director Paul Smith.
Smith continued: "We would encourage all passengers on flights that were affected to claim the compensation they 
are entitled to."
Shares in Ryanair were quoted at EUR13.11 on the Deutsche Borse Xetra exchange on Monday afternoon, down 
0.8%.

Dec 12, 2022( The Dawn: http://www.dawn.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Four children were fighting for their lives on Monday, after being pulled from an icy lake as an Arctic blast sent 
temperatures tumbling across the UK. 
'Four children have been taken to hospital in critical condition after being rescued from an ice-covered lake,' West 
Midlands Ambulance Service said, adding that they had been called to the lake in Solihull, central England, on 
Sunday afternoon. 
Emergency services said the children went into cardiac arrest when they were rescued and were taken to hospital 
in critical condition and reminded people to take care in potentially hazardous conditions. 
The incident came as the UK was hit by heavy snow and freezing conditions, causing major travel disruption, on the 
eve of a national rail strike on Tuesday that was already expected to bring the country to a grinding halt. 
Meanwhile, while two coal plants have been put on standby in case of a power crunch over winter. 
The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning on Monday for snow and ice in London and southeast England, 
with ice and fog warnings in other parts of England and the whole of Northern Ireland.

The snow caused issues for commuters and holidaymakers at the start of a fortnight where rail workers and border 
officials plan industrial action. 
Operations in many parts of London's underground network were either suspended or faced delays, while 
motorways witnessed gridlocks due to snow. 
London's Gatwick and Stansted airports warned that the conditions could disrupt flight schedules. 
'Our runway is temporarily closed whilst we undertake snow clearing,' the Stansted airport said, with many flights 
cancelled early on Monday. 
The airport is a main hub of budget airline Ryanair, which also cautioned about disruption to its flights at Gatwick, 
south of London. 
'Due to ongoing severe snowy weather across the UK, runaways at both Stansted and Gatwick have been 
temporarily closed tonight (11 December), disrupting all flights scheduled to depart Stansted/Gatwick during this 
temporary closure period,' it said. 
4 children 'critical' in hospital as UK hit by Arctic weather; heavy snow disrupts travel
Both airports were open on Monday, but passengers were told to brace for delays. 
Dozens of stranded passengers posted videos on social media showing snow-covered runways and planes stuck 
on the ground. 
More than 50 flights were also cancelled on Sunday at Heathrow, the UK's largest airport, due to freezing fog. 
Train and bus services in London were also severely affected after the dump of around four inches of snow 
overnight, which also forced the closure of parts of the M25 orbital route around the capital, the country's busiest 
motorway. 
Southeastern, which operates rail services into London, advised passengers not to travel due to severe disruption 
caused by snow and ice. 
 https://twitter.com/Se_Railway/status/1602203088085032960  
Some schools were also shut. 
Meanwhile, Britain's National Grid on Monday issued a notification to warm two winter contingency coal plants. 
'This measure should give the public confidence in Monday's energy supply,' the National Grid said, adding it was 
not confirmed the plants would be needed, but they would be ready. 
The UK has been experiencing a cold snap for several days, with temperatures dropping to -10 Celsius degrees in 
some areas, although the Met Office said the temperatures were 'not unusual for this time of year'.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) decided to no longer appeal a UK Civil Aviation Authority action in January 2022 and the 
succeeding Court of Appeal ruling that a protest by its pilots in 2018 was not an "extraordinary circumstance" that 
would excuse it from paying compensation to affected customers.
Affected customers can now make a claim for compensation from the Irish ultra-low-cost carrier, according to a 
Monday release from the aviation authority.  
Shares of the airline company rose nearly 3% late afternoon Dec. 9.

 A meeting between Germany's and Britain's top diplomats was canceled after a build-up of ice prevented Annalena 
Baerbock's plane from taking off on time.Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock had to cancel a meeting 
with her British counterpart after her airplane was grounded in Ireland due to ice. 
Baerbock said she was "very sad," she could not meet British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly. 
"But you can't do anything about force majeure — and certainly not about unexpected ice and snow in Dublin," the 
minister said. 
She was due to fly back to Berlin after the aircraft was de-iced. 
Baerbock met her Irish counterpart Simon Coveney in Dublin on Thursday. 
She was keen to travel to the UK too to underline the importance of Germany's partnership with Britain despite the 
problems caused by Brexit. 
"We are close partners and friends," the minister said in Berlin before departing for a visit to Ireland and Britain on 
Thursday.

resigned and the second time due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September.

depart due to a problem.

RYANAIR's boss has seen his contract extended until July 2028, in a deal that could make him an extra 
(EURO)100m (£86.3m).
Chairman Stan McCarthy said late on Wednesday the extension was reached following "extensive engagement 
with large shareholders and proxy advisors," but will still be subjected to shareholder approval.
As part of his 2019 package, Michael O'Leary was given the option of buying 10m Ryanair shares at around 
(EURO)11 per share if he increased the company's annual profit after tax to (EURO)2bn - or (EURO)21 per share. 
This would have led to a (EURO)100m bonus.
The 2019 terms have now been extended to the summer of 2028 and are dependent on the chief executive 
reaching a (EURO)2.2bn profit target.
"If these targets are not achieved then these share options will lapse and Michael O'Leary will receive nothing other 
than his basic salary," the carrier said in a statement.
Ryanair's shares were up 0.73 per cent yesterday afternoon.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) boss, Michael O'Leary has agreed to extend his contract to 2028 in a deal that 
will also extend a bonus scheme that could earn him close to (EURO)100mln.
The flamboyant 61-year-old has repeatedly said in recent years that he had no plans to retire and in September 
said he hoped to soon reach a deal on extending his contract beyond its expiry in 2024.
He has led the airline since 1994.
"The Board are ... pleased that Michael O'Leary has agreed to extend his leadership of the Ryanair Group to July 
2028," the airline's chairman Stan McCarthy said in a statement.
The decision followed "extensive engagement" with large shareholders and proxy advisors.
The extension of the contract and bonus scheme will be subject to shareholder approval, he said.

AIRLINES such as Ryanair and Easyjet yesterday called on the EU Commission to include long-haul flights within 
its environmental regulation.
The comments come on the heels of the Commission announcing that intra-EU airlines will pay for their CO2 
emissions starting next year.
Under the current legislative framework, airlines that operate intra- European flights have to submit permits to the 
bloc's carbon market to cover their emissions. Usually handed out for free, these permits are not needed by those 
operating longhaul flights.
The European Commission was approached for comment.

Dec 08, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Southwest Airlines' LUV[1] management decided to start paying quarterly dividends after a 
pandemic-induced hiatus of more than two years. With air-travel demand buoyant in Brazil, Gol Linhas GOL[2] 
reported a 28.5% year-over-year increase in November traffic. European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] 
reported a 9.8% year-over-year increase in passenger volume for the month of November. JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] 
was also in the news owing to its environmentally-friendly attitude. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[5]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. In November, RYAAY flew 11.2 million 
passengers, higher than 10.2 million flown a year-ago. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in November 
2022 was 92%, compared with 87% a year-ago. Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Ryanair was also in the news when it inked an environmentally-friendly deal with oil company Shell SHEL[6] for 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The MoU will see Shell supply SAF to more than 200 Ryanair airports across 
Europe, with the primary focus on the airline's major hubs in Dublin and London Stansted. Per the agreement, 
Ryanair will be able to access 360,000 tons (120 million gallons) of Shell's SAF between 2025 and 2030. This will 
help the airline cut its carbon emissions by about 900,000 tons. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7] 
2. At Gol Linhas, consolidated traffic for November increased 28.5% year over year. To match the increased 
demand situation, the company is expanding its capacity. During the same month, capacity grew 29.7% year over 
year. GOL carried 26% more passengers in November from the year-ago levels. Upbeat traffic in its domestic 
markets is leading to a rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In November, domestic traffic and capacity improved 
18.7% and 19.6%, respectively. On the domestic front, 21.7% more passengers boarded GOL's flights in November 
2022. 
3. Following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act, which prohibited airlines from paying dividends till Sep 
30, 2022, Southwest Airlines' management reinstated its quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share. With the carrier 
returning to profitability in March 2022 and expecting to be profitable for full-year 2022 as well, the decision was 
hugely-expected. The dividend will be paid on Jan 31, 2023 to its shareholders of record at the close of business on 
Jan 10. 
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV Reinstates Dividend, GOL Reports Rosy November Traffic
On its investor day, LUV also gave projections for some items for first-quarter and full-year 2023. Capacity 
(measured in available seat miles) is expected to increase 10% and 15% year over year, in first-quarter and full-
year 2023, respectively. Fuel cost per gallon is expected in the $3-$3.10 range in the March quarter. The same is 
expected in the $2.85-$2.95 range for full-year 2023. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be either flat or increase 
up to 2% year over year in first-quarter 2023. The metric is expected to be down in the 1-3% range for the full year. 
Interest expense is expected to be roughly $65 million and $250 million in first-quarter and full-year 2023, 
respectively. Capital spending for full-year 2023 is anticipated in the $4- $4.5 billion range. LUV expects to end the 
next year with 841 planes in its fleet. 
4. JetBlue's management stated that it aims to reduce emissions pertaining to jet fuel by 50% per revenue tonne 
kilometer by 2035 from 2019 levels. In accordance with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, JBLU aims to 
boost investments in lower-carbon solutions within its operation and evaluate future sustainability investments. 
JBLU aims to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040,10 years ahead of broader airline industry targets. 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
has decreased 4.4% to $58.18 over the past week. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
declined 17.8%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Delta Air Lines' DAL[8] management is scheduled to provide a 
financial outlook and provide a strategic update at an event in New York on Dec 14. With air-travel demand soaring, 
we believe that this Atlanta-based carrier's management will present a rosy picture with respect to the top line. 
With oil price still high the bottom-line growth is being restricted. As a result, market watchers will keenly await the 
steps outlined to reduce costs and dive growth. Stay tuned for other usual updates in the space.

THE GOVERNMENT will not create aviation-specific visas to address chronic staff shortages across the industry, 
the government confirmed yesterday.
Aviation minister Baroness Vere told journalists yesterday it was up to everyone working in the sector to establish a 
"sustainable and secure UK workforce that meets our needs, [and] that is diverse and skilled".
"Working with the sector, I think we can get through staffing challenges," she added. Post- Brexit labour rules have 
often been highlighted as one of the main issues affecting the UK travel and tourism sector, leading to issues such 
as this summer's travel chaos.
Industry stakeholders like Ryanair and Easyjet have repeatedly called on the UK to implement post-Brexit labour 
laws with a bit more common sense. Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary said this summer that it was easier getting a 
visa for an extra-EU labourer than for a EU one.
An emergency visa scheme has been put in place for hauliers after numbers fell post-Brexit and the pandemic.
Nevertheless, the government has always maintained that Brexit did not play a part in disruption at airports.
"I'm sure many saw what happened to the aviation sector in Europe and in the US, as they also struggled 
significantly," Baroness Vere commented.
"What happened at Schiphol was way worse than anything we saw in the UK."
Vere's comments come as Mark Tanzer, chief executive of trade body ABTA, called on ministers to consider 
extending the Youth Mobility Scheme to individual EU countries on a bilateral basis.
Sort yourselves out, minister tells aviation bosses
The Youth Mobility Scheme is a visa that allows young people from specific countries to live in the UK for up to two 
years. As of now, only a handful of countries take part in the scheme - including Australia, New Zealand and India.
"This would be a pragmatic move, in the absence of our negotiating a wider mobility chapter within the UK-EU trade 
deal, which is not due to be opened until 2025," Tanzer said.

Dec 07, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shell plc SHEL[1], the oil supermajor, entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Irish airline 
Ryanair RYAAY[2]. The MoU will see Shell supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to more than 200 Ryanair airports 
across Europe, with the primary focus on the airline's major hubs at Dublin and London Stansted.  
Per the agreement, Ryanair will be able to access 360,000 tons (120 million gallons) of Shell's SAF between 2025 
and 2030. This will help the airline cut its carbon emissions by about 900,000 tons. 
SAF, which is considered the key facilitator of aviation decarbonization, accounts for a trivial portion of worldwide jet 
fuel usage. Both parties resolved to advance the supply and use of SAF, with Ryanair committing to powering 
12.5% of its flights with SAF by 2030 and Shell aiming for renewable fuel to account for 10% of its global jet sales 
by the end of the decade. 
The MoU was signed at Aviation Sustainability Day, an event held at Trinity College Dublin's Sustainable Aviation 
Research Centre. 
Shell Aviation's president, Jan Toschka, stated that the prospect of building on Shell's existing relationship with 
Ryanair is fantastic. He further said that the initial agreement demonstrates that both firms recognize that SAF is the 
key to unlocking a net-zero future for the aviation industry. 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company Ryanair, which commenced its 
flight operations in 1985 and is based in Swords, Ireland. This ultra-low-fare carrier offers scheduled-passenger 
airline service in Ireland, the UK, Continental Europe, Morocco and Israel. 
Shell is one of the primary oil supermajors, a group of U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with 
operations spanning worldwide. The company is fully integrated as it participates in every aspect related to energy, 
from oil production to refining and marketing. SHEL operates as an energy and petrochemical company. 
Shell currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the energy space that warrant a look 
include Murphy USA MUSA[3] and Liberty Energy LBRT[4], each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[5] 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Murphy USA's 2022 earnings stands at $25.34 per share, which suggests an 
increase of 69.8% from the year-ago earnings of $14.92. 
MUSA beat the consensus mark for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average being approximately 51%. 
Shell ( SHEL ), Ryanair Collaborate for Sustainable Aviation Fuel
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Liberty's 2022 earnings is pegged at $2.02 per share, which implies an increase 
of about 298% from the year-ago loss of $1.02. 
LBRT beat the consensus mark for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being around 58.4%. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double" 
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

 British Airways[1] can finally realize its low-cost aspirations after its subsidiary BA Euroflyer has received its own 
Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) and Operating Licence (OL). BA Euroflyer will now gradually take over the parent 
airline's international short-haul network at London Gatwick. BA Euroflyer gets ready to stand on its own feet. 
BA announced in 2021 that it intended to establish BA Euroflyer as a separate entity with a lower cost structure[2], 
in its quest to fight competition at Gatwick from easyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air. Since it stopped international short-
haul services from Gatwick at the beginning of the pandemic, BA had left this market share unprotected. easyJet in 
particular has been strengthening its base at Gatwick, while Wizz entered the market by basing five aircraft there. 
Although officially just a paper airline until it would receive the AOC in the autumn of this year, BA launched 
Euroflyer on March 29, 2022 by operating under the British Airways AOC. Now that the CAA has approved the 
certificate and license, BA will transfer twenty Airbus aircraft to Euroflyer in the coming six months. One A320 is 
already registered with BA Euroflyer, but ten more will join as well as nine A321s. Crew will be (re)trained to comply 
with the airline's AOC requirements. 
BA Euroflyer will operate under the same principles as BA Cityflyer, the regional subsidiary that is based at London 
City Airport with a fleet of Embraer aircraft. But it has a different cost structure to make it more competitive with rival 
airlines. It took BA many rounds of negotiations to secure union support for its low-cost initiative. Cabin crew union 
Unite initially strongly opposed the plan, but approved the terms and conditions in November last year. This was a 
few weeks after the pilot union BALPA had agreed. In both cases, keeping as many jobs as possible at a time when 
BA had slashed some 10.000 positions during the pandemic was the main reason for the union's support. 
Euroflyer operated on over thirty routes this summer, including Amsterdam, Marrakech, and Santorini. The 2023 
summer schedule includes 29 destinations, many in the Mediterranean region like Italy, France, Croatia, Greece, 
Spain, Portugal, but also Turkey.

ITA Airways (AZ, Rome Fiumicino) has launched cooperation with Itabus, a privately-owned bus company, to 
operate bus services from two Italian cities to Rome Fiumicino under the carrier's AZ flight code.
Itabus will run 2x daily between Fiumicino and each of Pescara and Perugia. Connections launched on December 
1, 2022, and are scheduled to fit the airline's Rome connecting banks.
Pescara, a city located on the Adriatic coast, is currently served by ITA Airways up to 2x daily, albeit exclusively 
from Milan Linate. The airport also sees scheduled flights operated by Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) and Wizz Air (W6, 
Budapest). In turn, Perugia, the regional capital of Umbria, is not served by the flag carrier. Scheduled flights out of 
the city are operated by Ryanair, Wizz Air, AlbaStar, and Albawings. Neither of the cities has direct air connections 
to Rome at this point, the ch-aviation schedules module shows.
Other airlines operating aircraft/bus intermodal services include Lufthansa (services from Frankfurt Int'l to 
Strasbourg and from Munich to Nuremberg and Kempten) and American Airlines (services from Philadelphia Int'l to 
Atlantic City and Allentown).

Wizz Air flew 3.7 million passengers in November, up 70% from 2.2 million a year ago and 24% higher than 3.0 
million in November 2019. Wizz Air's load factor also grew annually, to 88% from 76% a year ago, but stayed below 
93% three years ago. Its capacity rose 47% to 4.2 million seats, from 2.9 million seats, while beating November 
2019's 3.2 million seats by 30%.
The Budapest-based airline said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Vienna-based OMV AG, for the 
supply of up to 185,000 metric tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel between 2023 and 2030. 
Wizz also expanded its Larnaca base in Cyprus as it allocated two more A321Neos from Airbus SE to grow the 
base to a total of four aircraft, which will operate 32 routes in 18 countries. 
Ryanair shares were down 1.6% at EUR12.99 each on Friday morning, while Wizz Air shares were down 0.4% to 
2,292.00p each.

RYANAIR is set to buy sustainable fuels from Shell between 2025 and 2030 as part of its green push.
The low-cost carrier yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding, pledging to purchase as much as 360,000 
tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by the end of the decade.
According to Ryanair, the agreement will save up to 900,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions - or the equivalent of 70,000 
flights between Dublin and Milan.
"SAF plays a key role in our 'Pathway to Net Zero' strategy, and also our commitment to a target of 12.5 per cent 
SAF by 2030," said Ryanair's sustainability director Thomas Fowler.
"Today's agreement with Shell helps Ryanair secure access to circa 20 per cent of this ambitious goal."
Christopher Surgenor, editor of trade publication Greenair News, told City A.M. the move, "while significant", might 
not be enough.
"By 2030, airlines have set a goal of having 10 per cent of their jet fuel coming from sustainable sources but given 
SAF is currently around 0.1 per cent of total sup- ply, a big ramp up will be required over the coming decade," he 
said.
Surgenor's words were echoed by Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary, who told journalists the airline's target 
could be too ambitious.
Ryanair to buy green fuel from Shell until 2030
"I'm not sure we'll get there but by signing up more partnership agreements with Shell, with Neste and with the 
other fuel suppliers, I think that gives us our best chance of maybe getting to 8, maybe 10, maybe 11," O'Leary said 
yesterday.
The low-cost company has struck deals with Finnish biofuel producer Neste as well as Australian oil and gas group 
OMV. "Who knows, hopefully we will get to 12.5 per cent by 2030," O'Leary added.
"But that will not happen unless we have a dramatic revolution in supply of production of SAFs and availability at 
our airports."
The Irish businessman is not the first to call for higher investment into SAF, with both airline veteran Willie Walsh 
and Rolls-Royce boss Warren East also having called for increased production.
It comes as the aviation industry welcomes a rebound in travel demand, with O'Leary noting Christmas bookings 
are running ahead of pre-pandemic levels.

Dec 02, 2022( Biofuels Digest: http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In Ireland, Ryanair and Shell signed a Memo of Understanding (MOU) to advance the supply of sustainable 
aviation fuel (SAF) at over 200 Ryanair airports across Europe, with particular focus on SAF supply at RYR's 
largest bases like Dublin and London Stansted[1]. 
While SAF is a key enabler of aviation decarbonisation, it currently accounts for just a small fraction of worldwide jet 
fuel usage. This agreement with Shell gives Ryanair potential access to 360,000 metric tons (120 million gallons) of 
SAF between 2025 and 2030, saving over approx. 900,000 tons in CO2 emissions (equiv. to over 70,000 flights 
from Dublin to Milan). The SAF that is covered by this MoU could potentially be produced from multiple different 
technology pathways and a broad range of sustainable feedstocks. 
This agreement, which was signed at the Sustainable Aviation Research Centre in Trinity College Dublin (TCD) this 
morning (where Ryanair and TCD held an Aviation Sustainability Day), demonstrates both Ryanair and Shell's 
commitment to work together to invest in SAF supply fuels. Ryanair has set itself ambitious targets of 12.5% SAF 
by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) is in talks about launching flights to Egypt and Libya, Ryanair Holdings Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary said without providing any further details.
The Irish LCC is focused on serving Europe and has a much narrower African and Middle-Eastern network 
compared to rivals Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) and easyJet (London Luton). While Ryanair's total capacity to the 
MENA region trumps its rivals at 93,663 weakly scheduled seats, the ch-aviation capacities module shows it is 
concentrated in Morocco (where Ryanair and Ryanair UK proffer 68,022 weekly seats, making the holding the 
second-largest carrier in the country after Royal Air Maroc (AT, Casablanca Int'l)) and Israel (17,892 seats). The 
Irish holding also serves Jordan.
In turn, Wizz Air serves Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates through its 
European AOCs, proffering 45,530 weekly scheduled seats to these markets. In addition, the Hungarian LCC is a 
JV partner in Wizz Air Abu Dhabi (5W, Abu Dhabi Int'l), whose weekly scheduled capacity adds another 40,504 
seats. easyJet serves Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia through its various AOCs, proffering 37,580 
weekly seats.
While Egypt is well-served by both scheduled and charter carriers on European routes, Libya currently sees an 
extremely limited network to Europe. The only carrier operating scheduled flights from Misurata to Malta Int'l is 
MedSky Airways, a virtual carrier currently chartering an A320-200 from Malta MedAir (MT, Malta Int'l) for its 2x 
weekly services. While all Libya-certified carriers are currently banned from the EU on safety grounds, there is no 
prohibition on services to Libya by EU-certified operators.

Ryanair and Shell have signed a Memo of Understanding (MOU) to supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at over 
200 Ryanair airports across Europe.
There will be a particular focus on SAF supply at the low-fare carrier's largest bases like Dublin and London

2030. Today's agreement with Shell helps Ryanair secure access to c.20% of this ambitious goal. Shell is a key 
sustainability partner for Ryanair, and we look forward to building on this collaboration with Shell as our Group 
grows sustainably to carry 225m passengers annually by FY26."
President of Shell Aviation, Jan Toschka, added:
"It is fantastic to build on our existing relationship with Ryanair to now look at what we can achieve together on 
sustainability. This initial agreement demonstrates that both companies recognise that SAF is the key to unlock a 
net zero future for aviation. We share the same ambition to enable Ryanair's passengers to fly lower carbon."

sustainability partner for Ryanair, and we look forward to building on this collaboration with Shell as our Group 
grows sustainably to carry 225m passengers annually by FY26." President of Shell Aviation, Jan Toschka, added: 
"It is fantastic to build on our existing relationship with Ryanair to now look at what we can achieve together on 
sustainability. This initial agreement demonstrates that both companies recognise that SAF is the key to unlock a 
net zero future for aviation. We share the same ambition to enable Ryanair's passengers to fly lower carbon. 
Leadership and bold actions are needed to accelerate the decarbonisation of flight, and today's announcement is a 
great example of this."

Ryanair will be lucky to receive 40 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft by the end of June from the 51 due for delivery, Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday, potentially impacting the airline's planned growth for 2023.
"We're contracted to get 51 aircraft from Boeing before the end of April. We will be lucky to get 40 aircraft by the 
end of June next year and that's critical to our continued growth," O'Leary told a Eurocontrol event.
Ryanair plans to grow from a record 168 million passengers this financial year to 185 million next. O'Leary said 
earlier this month that he was concerned Boeing might fall 5-10 aircraft short, knocking 1 or 2 million from that 
target.

Ryanair boss accuses French controllers of 'recreational' strikes
Ryanair boss accuses French controllers of 'recreational' strikes

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC boss Michael O'Leary has accused French air traffic controllers of carrying 
out "recreational" strikes during the summer months.
During a committee appearance before Irish politicians, the budget airline boss suggested that air traffic controller 
strikes happen on a Friday so that workers can get a three-day weekend.
Among the various charged comments he made during a three-hour committee appearance, he called on the 
European Commission to change laws so that only domestic French flights would be affected during air traffic 
controller strikes and that overflights would be protected.
Mr O'Leary also called on the proposed single European sky to be implemented, but said the European 
Commission "lacks the bottle" that earlier commissions had "to challenge the vested interests of the national 
governments".
In July, flights from French airports faced disruption as airport workers went on strike to demand salary rises to 
keep up with inflation.
They also called for a recruitment drive to deal with resurgent travel demand, which has put both airports and 
airlines under pressure this year after jobs were cut during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Speaking during an appearance before an Irish transport committee on Wednesday, Mr O'Leary accused French air 
traffic controllers of "recreational" striking.
"Many times, French air traffic controllers go on strike not because they want more pay, it's because they don't like 
(French President Emmanuel) Macron, or they didn't like the result of the football match… it's recreational striking.
"All the strikes generally take place on Fridays, and then they don't show up to work on the Saturday so they have a 
three-day weekend."
Ryanair boss accuses French controllers of 'recreational' strikes
He said that when French air traffic controllers go on strike, the French government uses minimum service 
legislation to protect French domestic flights.
"So, the French are all happily flying around the place. But it's the poor Irish, the Spanish, the Italians and the 
Germans who are taking all of the cancellations.
"Our people, our citizens, our visitors are being completely screwed over while a bunch of French air traffic 
controllers go on strike – and we fully respect their right to go on strike – but let the French take the hit.
"It shouldn't be Irish, Germans, Italians and Spanish who are not travelling to France (who) take the hit."
He added: "It is bizarre that Europe's free movement of people across Europe in a single market is allowed to be 
threatened by the French every time they have these recreational strikes, which they have frequently in the 
summer."
Mr O'Leary then called for a single European sky to be implemented – a proposal from 2001 – and accused the 
European Commission of not having the courage to implement it.
"The technology now exists to allow us to fly straight, we should be allowed to fly straight, we would burn less fuel, 
we would reduce our impact on the environment and we would pass on enormous savings to our customers."
"In other words, they move to the same air traffic control system as America has, one system operate by all."
"The difficulty is that it's opposed by every single air traffic controllers' national union because it means less jobs for 
them, and therefore they can't get national governments to agree to it."
He added: "The European Commission lacks the bottle that those earlier Commissions had to challenge the vested 
interests of the national governments."
"Nobody will European Commission wants to challenge the French government or the German government, even if 
it's in the interests of the vast and overwhelming majority of European citizens and passengers."

ASYJET seems to be better equipped than most of the legacy airlines when it comes to weathering the next few 
months.
First of all, the carrier's £700m net debt is one of the lowest in aviation while cash and money market deposits 
amount to £3.6bn.
Secondly, the low-cost airline is expecting strong demand for peak periods such as Christmas, with ticket yields up 
18 per cent, as well as the winter ski season.
"We do see in general that people gravitate towards value, which clearly is going to benefit us," chief executive 
Johan Lundgren told journalists yesterday. "Easyjet has always done well in times of economic uncertainty."
Nevertheless, Easyjet's bubble could be burst by low-cost rivals such as Ryanair, which has said several times it 
would perform better than rivals in times of peak inflation.
Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary said in October that people in a recession become more price-sensitive and "when 
they want to fly, they fly with Ryanair."
The two rivals may well try to one up each other, offering the lowest fares possible. How they will manage with 
soaring energy prices is another story.

Nov 30, 2022( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 EasyJet is to increase fares by more than 20 per cent and even higher at peak Christmas holiday times as the 
airline attempts to claw back losses totalling more than 2 billion. 
The bid to repair the fortunes of Britain's busiest short-haul airline and avoid big seasonal losses will mean easyJet 
flying 17 per cent fewer seats this winter and 11 per cent fewer as a whole for its financial year through to next 
September. 
While the airline expects to return to profitability next year, at this stage forecasts are for about 250 million, which is 
less than half that reported before the pandemic. The uncertainty surrounding the fortunes of the airline industry in 
general during this winter's expected recession in the UK and Europe, and the impact on easyJet in particular, sent 
the stock lower again in trading yesterday. 
After a four-week, 40 per cent rally from a ten-year low of 285p last month, the shares fell 2.6 per cent, or 10p, 
yesterday to close at 383p. 
The pan-European airline, which does half its business in and out of the UK, reported a summer trading quarter 
better than any other in its 27-year history with profits of 674 million. But after a heavily lossmaking winter last year 
and a chaotic post-pandemic restart to business last spring hampered by staff shortages, easyJet still managed to 
make losses in its financial year to the end of September of 178 million. 
Analysts believe that a recovery to profitability will be slow, with profits of no more than 250 million in its current 
financial year. That is in stark contrast to Ryanair, its big rival in the European short-haul market, which is on track 
to report profits back above 1 billion. 
EasyJet expects to fly 94 million seats this year[1] on which it might reasonably expect to carry 85 million 
passengers, down 11 per cent on pre-pandemic levels. For comparison, next year Ryanair expects to carry 186 
million passengers, 24 per cent above its pre-pandemic levels. 
EasyJet's capacity, as in the number of seats it will be flying over the next year, as a percentage of its pre-
pandemic flying schedule will sequentially be 84 per cent in the current Christmas quarter, 82 per cent in the 
traditionally slow months of January to March, 93 per cent in the Easter and spring quarter, and 99 per cent in the 
high summer peak season. 
The airline is deliberately targeting near-term capacity at Christmas and new year and the half-term skiing holidays, 
while paring back its schedules in between. 
EasyJet bumps up its ticket prices by 20 per cent as losses soar to 2bn
It reported that with two months gone of this quarter and Christmas holiday season bookings in place, revenues per 
seat — a reasonable proxy for ticket prices — are on average up 20 per cent on top of the 33 per cent increase 
over the past year. 
Asked if rising fares were sustainable during a cost of living crunch, Johan Lundgren, chief executive, said: 'We are 
seeing strong demand at peak times, and that is reflected in these numbers. But outside the peak we are having to 
stimulate the market.' 
That indicates that with having to cut fares to get people flying during the slow weeks this winter, peak fares are 
rising well in excess of 20 per cent. 
Asked about the City's forecasts of profitability of just 250 million in the current year, Lundgren, 56, said: 'If we were 
not comfortable [with the forecasts] we would have to say so. 
'There is uncertainty around macroeconomic factors and we respect that people need to see more clarity around 
those factors. But we are making progress on productivity and our transformation of the business, and demand 
remains strong for people wanting to go on holiday.'

Court of Appeal rules against EasyJet again on flight delay claims
Court of Appeal rules against EasyJet again on flight delay claims

Nov 28, 2022( Legal Futures: https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/EasyJet.jpg EasyJet: Airline could pay compensation without 
requiring claims 
EasyJet's latest effort to cut out solicitors from flight delay claims has failed, after the Court of Appeal found 
shortcomings in its automated system. 
Though the court upheld[1] the role of automated systems for flight claims in principle, it said EasyJet's failure to 
allow a customer to see what data had been entered so they could correct errors put a material obstacle in their 
way, in breach of the relevant regulation. 
Lord Justice Males also observed how EasyJet could pay flight delay compensation without needing passengers to 
claim but chose not to in the hope that some would not. 
The two claimants had valid claims for €250 each subject to the question of whether they first applied for the 
compensation directly to Easyjet, using its online dispute resolution system. 
EasyJet's terms and conditions required passengers to submit claims 'directly' and give it 28 days to respond to 
them before engaging third parties to claim on their behalf. 
In July 2019, the claimants' solicitors, Surrey law firm Lovetts. wrote a letter before action to EasyJet. The airline 
replied by taking the point that no claim had been submitted via the online portal. 
This was finally done in April 2021 by an employee of claims business Flightright and the system generated an 
automatic email response which stated that the airline had been unable to find the booking and asked the 
passengers to resubmit their claim. 
Giving the lead judgment, Lord Justice Birss observed that the email did not identify any particular error in what had 
been entered or set out what had been entered; it simply asked them to start again. The system did not allow 
customers to see what information had been entered previously. 
Only after the decisions at first instance and on first appeal - which went in favour of the airline - did it became clear 
that the booking references of the two passengers had been erroneously transposed, meaning the names entered 
did not match the booking references. 
Birss LJ agreed with the ruling in Bott v Ryanair that 'airlines are entitled to require the use of a well-designed online 
dispute resolution portal for those passengers who are capable of using them'. 
Court of Appeal rules against EasyJet again on flight delay claims
He continued: 'However, this dispute has shown that even people who are experienced in using such systems can 
make mistakes, and the automatic email response in this case was not helpful because it did not spell out what data 
had actually been entered in the first place. 
'Had it done so, the submitter could have rechecked and correctly entered the data, and this litigation would likely 
have been avoided. No doubt the airline would rather not go to the effort of coding the system to do that, but I 
cannot imagine that it would be difficult to do.' 
The system here risked 'itself amounting to a material obstacle in the way of passengers making claims', contrary to 
the regulation. 
Snowden and Males LJJ both agreed, with the latter saying 'we need not have too much sympathy for EasyJet'. 
He explained: 'Its computer knows which flights have been subject to delay and knows the identities of the 
passengers on those flights. 
'Although there was no evidence about this, it ought not to be difficult for it to contact passengers (or at any rate, 
those who have made the booking for passengers) who are entitled to compensation, but no doubt it suits EasyJet 
that a certain percentage of passengers will never bother to claim. 
'So, although EasyJet is not required to contact passengers in this way, in a sense any costs incurred in handling 
the claims of those passengers who do claim can be set against the savings achieved as a result of deciding not to 
pay compensation unless a claim is made.' 
But he accepted that easy-to-use automated online systems for handling flight delay claims was 'strongly' in the 
interests of passengers so they could receive 'prompt payment without incurring legal fees or needing to pay claims 
companies'. 
They were also in the public interest 'because such claims should be capable of resolution in this way and court 
proceedings should only be necessary where there is some issue which only a court can decide'. 
He laid out four conditions for such a system: 
The airline's terms and conditions must make clear to the passenger that the use of the online system is 
compulsory, and must be used before court proceedings are commenced; The passenger should have the ability - 
and be strongly encouraged - to save the submitted claim; The system should explain that certain details incorrectly 
entered lead to the claim being rejected; and If a claim is rejected on the ground that the claim details have not 
been correctly entered, the automated response sent by the airline must make this clear. EasyJet's system 'did not 
satisfy any of these requirements', Males LJ said. 
He agreed with Birss LJ's comment that costs should not necessarily follow the event in this case. 
'I would urge the parties, in this low-value claim where the costs far exceed the amount claimed, to reach some 
sensible agreement about costs in order to avoid yet further expense,' Males LJ said. 
The court also rejected EasyJet's complaint that, as the claimants had not made their online claims themselves, 
they had breached its terms and conditions. 
Birss LJ: 'Even if the matter was free from authority, I would hold that passengers are entitled to have someone else 
access the online portal on their behalf and thereby make a claim in their name. 
'That other person could be a friend or family member, or it could be a claims handling company or solicitor 
engaged for that purpose. A claim made that way would be 'direct' as that word is used in the conditions of carriage. 
'Furthermore if the true construction of the word 'direct' would not permit this activity, then it would be a material 
obstacle in passenger's path and would be unlawful and ineffective. 
'The fact that an airline may prefer it for passengers not to engage a claims handling company at that early stage to 
use the online portal is irrelevant.'

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has announced it will reopen its bases at Lanzarote and Tenerife Sur in the Canary 
Islands for the Summer 2023 season, three years after the COVID-19 pandemic forced their closure.
The airline said it would deploy four aircraft in total to the two airports. The development will be accompanied by 
network expansion comprising three new routes from Lanzarote (Cologne/Bonn, Knock, and Paris Beauvais) and 
the same number of added services from Tenerife Sur (Bordeaux, Eindhoven, and Nuremberg).
Ryanair made no mention about the reopening of its third Canarian base closed in 2020 - Las Palmas. However, 
speaking during the press conference, the President of the Canary Islands autonomous government, Ángel Víctor 
Torres, said the airline was evaluating not just Las Palmas but also Fuerteventura and Santa Cruz de La Palma. 
Local authorities are now trying to attract carriers to launch or restart services to La Palma following the 2021 
eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano, which destroyed a substantial amount of infrastructure on the island.
The ch-aviation capacities module shows that even with no base at Lanzarote and Tenerife Sur, the Irish LCC is still 
their largest carrier by capacity in the current winter season, with a 25.5% and 23.0% market share by scheduled 
departure seats, respectively. The carrier has a 16.2% market share out of the entire Canarian archipelago, trailing 
only local specialist Binter Canarias (NT, Las Palmas).

Budget carrier Ryanair is to retrofit split scimitar winglets across more than 400 Boeing 737-800s in its fleet, in order 
to trim fuel consumption.
The retrofit programme will commence during the winter season, the airline states, and represents an investment of 
more than $200 million.
Manufactured by Aviation Partners Boeing, a joint venture, split scimitar winglets are an evolution of the blended 
winglet on the 737, and incorporate curved aerodynamic tips and a ventral strake.
Ryanair says the agreement covers 409 aircraft and will cut fuel burn by 1.5%.
It referred to the agreement in a half-year briefing in which ­Ryanair Group revealed a net profit of €1.37 billion 
($1.37 billion) for the six months to 30 September, higher than its last pre-crisis figure. This included €4.9 million 
from Malta Air and €22.4 million from other group airlines.
Ryanair attributes the performance to “record” traffic in the second quarter and “robust” summer fares, along with 
“strong” ­operational reliability.
The carrier had introduced a total fleet of 73 737 Max jets across its group fleet by the summer peak, rising to 77 by 
the end of September, but it is irritated by delays in deliveries.
Ryanair is expecting only 10-12 additional Max arrivals before the Christmas holiday period, out of 21 contracted, 
and chief executive Michael O’Leary claims growth is “being hampered” by the “inability” of Boeing to meet the 
third-quarter timetable.
He adds that Boeing has assured the airline that it will complete all 51 of the Max deliveries scheduled before 
summer 2023 – pointing out that 2023-2024 growth plans are based on these fleet additions – but states that there 
is a “risk that some of these deliveries could slip”.
No Headline In Original
While O’Leary says the carrier remains dependent on Boeing meeting its delivery commitments, it is “modestly” 
raising its full-year 2022-2023 activity forecast to 168 million passengers from the ­previous 166.5 million.
This would equate to a 13% increase over pre-pandemic figures.
O’Leary says he hopes that ­full­year fares will remain ahead of pre-crisis levels, but cautions that yields could still 
be affected at “very short notice” by events in the second half.
But if such setbacks are avoided, O’Leary says the airline could ­“minimise” winter losses and ­deliver pre-
exceptional net profits of €1-1.2 billion for the full year.
“This cautious guidance will remain hugely dependent on not suffering adverse events this winter – as we did last, 
which were clearly beyond our control,” he states.
Additonally, O’Leary insists that concerns over rising inflation and recession on Ryanair’s business have been 
“greatly exaggerated”.
“As the lowest-cost producer in Europe, we expect to grow ­strongly in a recession as consumers won’t stop flying – 
but ­rather they will become more price­­sensitive,” he says.
“Our very strong [post-pandemic] recovery shows that price will continue to drive market-share gains as we add 
low-cost, more fuel-efficient, aircraft to our fleet over the next four years.”
O’Leary argues that, over the course of the pandemic, short-haul capacity has undergone a “considerable 
contraction” and claims that much of this “will not return in the medium term”.
“Consumer propensity to travel remains high in Europe as a result of full employment, rising wages and two years 
of pent-up-demand and accumulated savings,” he says.
“We expect these strong ­fundamentals will continue to ­underpin robust traffic and average fare growth for the next 
18 months at least.” ◗

 Italian media speculate thatLufthansa[1] is looking for a new partner to acquire a majority stake in ITA Airways. The 
name that is mentioned most often is that of the Italian railway company Ferrovie Dello State Italiane[2], or FS for 
short. ITA Airways' future now seems to depend on Lufthansa and Italian railway company FS. 
The privatization ofITA Airways[3] continues to surprise observers as potential buyers are constantly changing. 
After the initial interest of Lufthansa Group at the beginning of this year following a joint offer from Lufthansa and 
shipping company MSC Group. They seemed in pole position until a consortium led by US investor Certares, Delta 
Air Lines, and Air France-KLM entered the scene. 
The Italian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance entered exclusive negotiations with Certares that were 
expected to result in a firm agreement. But the new Meloni Administration opted not to extend the period of 
exclusivity after October, which reopened options for Lufthansa and MSC for new negotiations. The German/Swiss 
consortium was given exclusive access to ITA's data room until MSC Group caught many by surprise by 
announcing early this week that it would withdraw from the bidding process. MSC stated it did no longer recognize 
conditions in the current bidding process, an indication that things have become blurred. 
The MSC decision has left privatization in turmoil. Certares seems out of the picture altogether now, which would 
make Lufthansa the sole candidate. The German airline group is keeping its lips tight and isn't sharing its cards with 
the media. Italian newspapers report that Lufthansa might have three options now: go it alone and make an all-out 
bid for ITA Airways, forgo the opportunity and close the book on ITA, or find a partner. 
This is where FS comes into the picture again. The Italian rail company has been touted as the buyer of ITA's 
predecessor Alitalia in 2019, when it teamed up with Atlantia, Delta Air Lines, the Ministry of Economic Affair and 
Finance, and initially easyJet to acquire eighty percent of the ailing airline. Although this bid failed, some, including 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, have always believed that Fs would eventually buy ITA Airways. 
La Corriere Della Sera[4]reports that a joint offer could leave Lufthansa with a 51 percent share of ITA for €250 
million, with FS buying 29 percent for an undisclosed amount. The Italian state would retain twenty percent of the 
airline. This compares to just twenty percent for Lufthansa in the offer with MSC, in which the shipping group would 
take a sixty percent share. The Certares consortium was offered a 50.01 percent share, with the Italian state 
retaining 49.99 percent. 
ITA Airways' future now seems to depend on Lufthansa and Italian railway company FS
For the government, it is key that ITA Airways finds itself 'a solid industrial partner to guarantee a certain future for 
the airline', Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, Giancarlo Giorgetti, reportedly saidin a press conference[5] 
on Tuesday. And this needs to be done quickly, as according to media reports in Italia, ITA is running out of cash 
quickly. Despite securing another €400 million in state support recently, its cash is set to be reduced to just €100 
million in the coming months. The carrier can count on a final €250 million installment of the original €1.35 billion 
that was provided in 2021. Earlier this month, ITA said that it had secured the finance for theacquisition of 39 new 
aircraft[6] in 2023.

 Fitch Ratings on Wednesday affirmed its long-term issuer default and senior unsecured ratings on Ryanair 
(RYA.IR) and unit Ryanair DAC at BBB and changed the outlook to positive from stable. 
The revised outlook reflects the Irish budget airline's expected improvement in leverage in the fiscal year ending 
March 31, 2025, following a strong recovery and solid operational performance due to pent-up demand and 
additional capacity. 
Meanwhile, the rating is backed by the company's strong traffic recovery in the first half of financial 2023, alongside 
adequate fuel and foreign exchange hedging, coupled with its improved market share.
Ryanair's stock fell nearly 3% on Wednesday's close.

Ryanair may prolong Boeing 737NG service due to MAX delays
Ryanair may prolong Boeing 737NG service due to MAX delays

Ryanair Holdings is considering prolonging its use of the B737-800 workhouse due to delayed B737-8-200 
deliveries, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said during the group's half-yearly earnings call.
"We're growing faster than we originally thought we would at this time because we're not retiring older aircraft. In 
fact, one of the aircraft we returned off an operating lease two years ago has now been offered back to us at a very 
significant discount. And we will opportunistically add B737NGs in ones and twos where there's a financial incentive 
to do so," he said.
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that the LCC owns its entire fleet of one B737-700, 409 B737-800s, 
and seventy-eight B737-8-200s operated across its four AOCs (Ryanair, Ryanair UK, Buzz (Poland), and Malta Air). 
However, the twenty-nine A320-200s operated by Lauda Europe are all leased.
O'Leary stressed that the MAX 200 delivery delays were hampering the LCC's ambitious post-COVID growth plans. 
The group was due to take a further 21 of the type by the end of 2022 but currently expects only 10-12. Ryanair 
Holdings hopes to receive 46 by the summer 2024 peak and has been assured by Boeing that this schedule will be 
met, although O'Leary conceded that some of the aircraft could slip to a later date.
He emphasised that despite the delays, the airline was not looking to a second-hand market to add more B737s.
"There isn't much of a second-hand market out there at the moment on B737NGs. A lot of those aircraft have gone 
back into cargo conversion programs, et cetera," O'Leary pointed out.
The group currently has 132 MAX 200s on order. O'Leary said the current backlog was sufficient to fuel the airline's 
growth for the next three years, although it already foresees a need for a new commitment.
"Sometime in 2024, 2025, we would like to be back at discussions with Boeing on a new aircraft deal, but Boeing 
have to sort out their own manufacturing challenges at the moment, and they're going to deliver what they've 
committed to first before we can actually start negotiating new aircraft orders with any sense of confidence. In the 
meantime, Airbus is moping up huge amounts of Boeing's market share. They're now converting a lot of Boeing 
customers in China and the UK. Jet2 (United Kingdom) has gone to Airbus from Boeing. I have no doubt that once 
they sort out the current production problems, Boeing will want to recapture market share," he said.
Ryanair may prolong Boeing 737NG service due to MAX delays
In the meantime, the Irish LCC outlined plans to invest around USD200 million in retrofitting all of its B737-800s with 
split scimitar wingtips which should begin later this winter season.

Can EU Travel Stocks Keep Their Peak Amid Sky-High Inflation

Nov 15, 2022( ValueWalk: https://www.valuewalk.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 European shares have been headlining a seven-week high, as stocks in travel, leisure and technology helped 
close the benchmark STOXX 600 higher[1] than expected on November 7, ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. 
Against the backdrop of stubbornly high inflation[2] across the European Union, which hit a record 10.7% in 
September[3], investors remain hawkish over the prospects of European shares as the continent battles an 
impending energy crisis on the back of a looming recession. 
Q3 2022 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[4] 
Sentiment in the market has been perplexed, to say the least over the last few weeks, even as European shares 
have been able to make a steady recovery. 
It's been a boisterous start to November, but experts predict that the coming weeks will see European shares 
closing lower than expected on the back of U.S. inflation data, jobs report and Biden's Inflation Reduction Act[5]. 
Stocks surged on November 10, after the U.S. consumer price index[6] climbed by 0.4% for October, and 7.7% 
from a year ago. This marked the lowest annual increase since the start of the year. 
Though the outcome of the results will guide the Fed's expectations concerning its interest rate outlook, investors 
are still treading lightly despite seeing better-than-expected inflation data. 
Looking past the politics, European investors are hopeful that with inflation deep diving into consumers' disposable 
income, the ongoing market growth will help drive the performance of travel and leisure stocks[7] as it makes a 
steady rebound after more than two years of tumultuous performance due to the COVID-pandemic. 
Will EU Travel Stocks Keep Their Current Trajectory 
So far this year, EU lawmakers have been toiling with immense challenges, all of which have played down the 
continent's post-pandemic recovery. 
Though these challenges are often more politically driven than they ought to be, some are seeking guidance on 
whether their illustrious travel stocks will keep their current trajectory despite the ongoing economic point of 
concern. 
The best performers so far have been European-based airline groups including Ryanair[8] (NASDAQ:RYAAY[9]), 
France - KLM (EPA:AF[10]), and Lufthansa (ETR:LHA[11]). Other operators including British Airways holding 
Can EU Travel Stocks Keep Their Peak Amid Sky-High Inflation
company, International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG[12]), and trans-European domestic airline EasyJet 
(LON:EZJ[13]) have all posted above-average earnings throughout much of the year. 
On the stock market, prices have been steadily climbing on the back of positive earnings. Ryanair, Air France - 
KLM, and Lufthansa climbed by 24.29%, 2.31%, and 20.50%, respectively. 
Airliners have had a particularly above-average summer performance, as pent-up travel demand surged[14] in the 
wake of countries lifting their border and quarantine restrictions. 
Originally experts suggested that airlines will only see full recovery by late 2023, or early 2024. 'Travel has never 
been more in demand than right now, despite higher prices and soaring travel costs. Even if consumers are making 
their trips shorter, and spending less abroad, they're still eager to travel, regardless of the seasonality,' says David 
Stewart, CEO of the European-based travel platform, Guide to Europe[15]. 
Even with positive guidance, it's been a hard ball to throw for investors who remain hawkish over the future of travel 
and leisure on the continent. 
It's not only the cost of travel that has consumers reaching deeper into their pockets, but also political tension 
between Russia and Ukraine, and higher-than-expected interest rate hikes by the European Central Bank (ECB). 
A member of the ECB recently told CNBC[16] that peak inflation could be within reach if the ECB continues with its 
monetary tightening. This could be a hard pill to swallow for investors, as the Governing Council raised its 
benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points in both September and October. 
We could see investors keeping steady on travel and leisure and a potential safety net, but with so much volatility in 
the market, many could soon be parking their cash somewhere else. 
Noting how European consumers have been making several inflationary adjustments, Stewart shares that although 
domestic tourism[17] won't experience a stratospheric boom over the coming months, consumers in other regions 
will continue to take advantage of the weaker euro. 
'We've already seen it this past summer, where Americans took to the skies in droves, landing in Europe with their 
stronger forex, and hoping to get the best bang for their buck,' says Stewart. 
Investors will need to factor in not only economic uncertainty, but also political upheaval that's causing more 
damage than resolving some of the continent's post-pandemic problems. Despite the uptick performance of travel 
and leisure stocks in recent weeks, the coming months might show a different picture, and it could leave Europeans 
right in the middle of the crossfire.

 We've already seen how handy it's been in all the usual places you'd use a digital wallet — plus some others, like 
attending concerts with friends. Let's look at four different ways you can use Google Wallet around the world. 
Make quick, secure payments from your watch: Last month we added Wallet to the Google Pixel Watch[1] so you 
can easily make contactless payments. And starting today, anyone with a Fitbit Sense 2 or Versa 4[2] can pay with 
just a tap of their wrist. Tap and pay on public transit: If you're one of the millions of people who commute by public 
transportation, you can use Wallet to tap and pay in hundreds of cities around the world. In Japan, we recently 
added support for PASMO[3] on mobile devices and launched Suica[4] on the Google Pixel Watch. Save mobile 
tickets for events and shows: We're partnering with many companies — including Ticketmaster, Thaiticketmajor in 
Thailand, Cinemaxx in Germany and Ticketek, Humanitix and Oztix in Australia — so Android users can add mobile 
event tickets to their Wallet. My daughters are big Taylor Swift fans, so I'll be trying out this feature for her tour next 
year. Access boarding passes: There's so much to keep track of before a flight. So we partner with airlines like 
AirAsia, Air France, China Air, Ryanair and United Airlines to help travelers easily save and access their mobile 
boarding passes in Wallet. You can even save multiple boarding passes if you're traveling with family or friends. Pro 
tip: To quickly add your boarding pass, just take a screenshot of it on your Pixel phone and tap 'Add to Google 
Wallet.' 
These are just some ways you can use Google Wallet throughout your day. As Wallet expands to more places 
around the world, look out for even more features to easily access what you need.

Ryanair loses legal challenge against Croatia Airlines aid
Ryanair loses legal challenge against Croatia Airlines aid

Europe's second-highest court has dismissed a case Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) brought last year against a European 
Commission decision to approve EUR11.7 million euros (USD14 million at the time) in state aid to Croatia Airlines 
(OU, Zagreb), court records show.
The judgement of the European General Court of November 9 in Case T-111/21, "Ryanair DAC vs European 
Commission supported by the Republic of Croatia", disagreed with the Irish low-cost carrier, which had lodged its 
complaint in May 2021 against a decision in Brussels in 2020 to approve the bailout, provided to the state-owned 
flag carrier to compensate for pandemic-related travel restrictions that Croatia and other countries introduced 
between March 19 and June 30, 2020.
As with similar legal action it has instigated during the crisis, Ryanair had argued that EU regulators should have 
opened an investigation before approving the assistance. It also claimed that the aid to the flag carrier, which 
already had a dominant share, had distorted the market in particular against Ryanair as "the only real challenger of 
Croatia Airlines' market position."
The court ruled, however, that "the arguments put forward by the applicant [...] are very general and hypothetical, 
insofar as they do not specifically concern its position on the market in which it competes with the beneficiary of the 
aid." These "arguments are inadequately substantiated, with the result that it is not in a position to demonstrate that 
the aid at issue is liable to have a substantial adverse effect on its market position."
It added: "Its line of argument is based, in reality, on the mere fact that it is a competitor of Croatia Airlines and that, 
unlike Croatia Airlines, it does not benefit from aid granted by the Croatian State, which constitutes a competitive 
disadvantage for the applicant. Such a general line of argument is not sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant's 
market position was substantially affected."
Ryanair had also said that Croatia Airlines received additional Covid-related state aid, which the court in its ruling 
revealed to have been EUR79.7 million (USD81.8 million), granted in December 2020. However, "as that new aid 
was granted after the adoption of the contested decision, the Commission cannot, in any event, be criticised for not 
having taken it into account in the contested decision, since [...] facts subsequent to the adoption of the decision at 
issue have no effect on its legality."
Ryanair loses legal challenge against Croatia Airlines aid
The court ordered Ryanair to bear its own legal costs in relation to the case and to pay those incurred by the 
European Commission, while the Croatian government was also instructed to pay its own court costs.
Ryanair did not immediately respond to ch-aviation's request for comment and Croatia Airlines declined to 
comment.

District Court Decision Brings New Life to CFAA to Combat Unwanted Scraping
District Court Decision Brings New Life to CFAA to Combat Unwanted 
Scraping

Nov 11, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 On October 24, 2022, a Delaware district court held that certain claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 
(CFAA) relating to the controversial practice of web scraping were sufficient to survive the defendant's motion to 
dismiss. (Ryanair DAC v. Booking Holdings Inc.[1], No. 20-01191 (D. Del. Oct. 24, 2022)). The opinion potentially 
breathes life into the use of the CFAA to combat unwanted scraping. 
In the case, Ryanair DAC ('Ryanair'), a European low-fare airline, brought various claims against Booking Holdings 
Inc. (and its well-known suite of online travel and hotel booking websites) (collectively, 'Defendants') for allegedly 
scraping the ticketing portion of the Ryanair site. Ryanair asserted that the ticketing portion of the site is only 
accessible to logged-in users and therefore the data on the site is not public data. 
The decision is important as it offers answers (at least from one district court) to several unsettled legal issues 
about the scope of CFAA liability related to screen scraping. In particular, the decision addresses: 
 the potential for vicarious liability under the CFAA (which is important as many entities retain third party service 
providers to perform scraping) how a data scraper's use of evasive measures (e.g., spoofed email addresses, 
rotating IP addresses) may be considered under a CFAA claim centered on an 'intent to defraud' clarification as to 
the potential role of technical website-access limitations in analyzing CFAA 'unauthorized access' liability 
To find answers to these questions, the court's opinion distills the holdings of two important CFAA rulings from this 
year - the Supreme Court's holding in Van Buren that adopted a narrow interpretation of 'exceeds unauthorized 
access' under the CFAA[2] and the Ninth Circuit's holding in the screen scraping hiQ case where that court found 
that the concept of 'without authorization' under the CFAA does not apply to 'public' websites[3]. 
Ryanair's complaint advanced multiple claims under the CFAA including, among others: 
 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(2)(C), which prohibits 'intentionally access[ing] a computer without authorization or exceed[ing] 
authorized access, and thereby obtain[ing] . . . information from any protected computer,' 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(4), 
which prohibits 'knowingly and with intent to defraud, access[ing] a protected computer without authorization, or 
exceed[ing] authorized access, and by means of such conduct further[ing] the intended fraud and obtain[ing] 
anything of value.'; and 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(5)(A), which prohibits 'knowingly caus[ing] the transmission of aprogram 
and as a result of such conduct, intentionally caus[ing] damage without authorization, to a protected computer.' 
[1][4] 
District Court Decision Brings New Life to CFAA to Combat Unwanted Scraping
The defendants argued that Ryanair's complaint must be dismissed for several reasons: (1) that the CFAA does not 
permit claims to be brought on a vicarious liability theory; (2) that Ryanair has not alleged that the defendants have 
caused the requisite harm for a viable CFAA claim; (3) that Ryanair did not sufficiently plead its CFAA claim based 
on an intent to defraud; and (4) that Ryanair's CFAA 'without authorization' claim fails on the merits in light of the 
principles of Van Buren and hiQ. 
Vicarious liability under the CFAA 
According to the plaintiff's amended complaint, the defendants entered into numerous contracts with non-party 
scraping providers to bypass the technical and non-technical barriers on the Ryanair site and perform the scraping 
at issue. Ryanair's complaint asserts that 'Defendants cannot avoid CFAA liability by engaging agents and third 
parties to exceed the Defendants' authorized access to the Ryanair Website on their behalf.' 
The defendants argued that Ryanair could not rely on a theory of indirect or vicarious liability in bringing a civil claim 
under the CFAA, contending that the statute permits a civil action 'against the violator,' that is, the individuals who 
actually take the actions at issue. Ryanair contended that CFAA liability extends beyond the persons who directly 
access a computer unlawfully and to those who direct, encourage, or induce a third party to commit such violation. 
In finding Ryanair's vicarious civil claims were cognizable under the CFAA, the district court pointed to a bevy of 
decisions that have recognized that vicarious or indirect liability under the CFAA extends to parties who direct, 
encourage, induce, or conspire with others to commit acts that violate the statute. While the court conceded that 
there is a body of case law that stands for the more limited proposition that a principal is not vicariously liable for an 
agent's CFAA violation if the principal had no knowledge of or involvement in the agent's conduct, the court found in 
the instant case that Ryanair alleged that the defendants directed third parties to access the myRyanair portion of 
the Ryanair website without authorization, and therefore would have had the requisite knowledge. Moreover, the 
court noted that Ryanair allegations that defendants 'entered into written agreements with their agents and certain 
third parties who access the Ryanair Website without authorization (or alternatively, in excess of their authorized 
access) on behalf of the Defendants' supported a plausible vicarious claim. As such, the district court found that a 
vicarious liability claim under the CFAA was adequately pleaded at this stage. 
CFAA 'Intent to Defraud' Claim Based on Evasive Scraping Practices 
Ryanair's complaint alleges a violation of 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(4), which prohibits 'knowingly and with an intent to 
defraud access[ing] a protected computer without authorization.' Examining the issue of whether the federal Rule 
9(b) heightened pleading standards for fraud claims apply to this type of CFAA claim, the court declared that 'the 
law on this issue is a mess.' Sidestepping the question, the court found Ryanair's CFAA 'intent to defraud' claim to 
be sufficiently pleaded under any standard, concluding that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the defendants 
'engaged in fraudulent conduct by misrepresenting themselves, for example by 'lying about [their] email address[es] 
or anonymizing [their] IP address[es],' when creating accounts on the Ryanair website' and using fake user names 
to avoid detection from Ryanair's anti-bot programs. 
Access 'Without Authorization': Clarifying Van Buren  
Contending that Ryanair's 'unauthorized access' claim should be dismissed on the merits, the defendants argued 
that the Ryanair website is a public website, to which the CFAA's concept of 'authorization' or 'authorized access' 
does not apply; Ryanair countered that the portion of its website where tickets may be booked is not public and 
requires a customer login and that, regardless, the defendants were not authorized to access the that portion of the 
Ryanair website. 
Citing the Supreme Court's Van Buren decision and the Ninth Circuit's hiQ opinion, the Delaware court stated that 
'recent case law interpreting the CFAA makes clear that the CFAA's concept of authorization focuses heavily on 
technological barriers to access'[2][5], an interpretation bolstered by the hiQ court's differentiation of a public 
website and one 'protected by [a] username and password authentication system.' As the Ryanair court summed 
up: 
'The above cases make clear that in order for the CFAA's 'without authorization' and 'exceeds authorized access' 
elements to apply, some sort of authentication mechanism (e.g., the use of usernames and passwords) must be 
employed to limit access to the website. If the information on the website is publicly available without requiring 
users to authenticate themselves, a violation of the terms of use or the defiance of a cease-and-desist letter will not 
give rise to liability under the CFAA. 
Thus, for a website to fall under CFAA protections, the court said, it must have erected limitations on access 
(whereas, if a website is made available to the public without any authentication requirement, the concept of 
'without authorization' is inapplicable).[3][6] 
District Court Decision Brings New Life to CFAA to Combat Unwanted Scraping
Applying these principles, the Delaware court noted that Ryanair alleges that users must login to the myRyanair 
portion of the Ryanair website using a username and password. Further, Ryanair alleged and that it used technical 
measures to attempt to block software bots engaging in scraping of the site (measures which were allegedly 
bypassed by the defendants). Ryanair's amended complaint further alleged that the defendants circumvented code-
based authentication mechanisms designed to limit access to the myRyanair portion of the website, in violation of 
the terms and even after receiving cease-and-desist letters revoking access. As the Ryanair court concluded: 
'Although those allegations would be insufficient to establish liability under the CFAA if the contents of the 
myRyanair portion of the website were accessible to the public without authentication, courts have found cease-
and-desist letters to withdraw authorization to access a protected portion of a website when an authentication 
mechanism protected access to that portion of the website.' 
Thus, the Delaware court allowed the 'unauthorized access' claims to go forward as Ryanair had raised a plausible 
claim as to whether the myRyanair portion of its website was non-public, thus making the defendants' continued 
access to those pages unauthorized for purposes of the CFAA. 
Final Thoughts 
There are a number of specific and important observations to discern from the decision: 
 The ruling in the Ryanair case suggests that a cognizable vicarious liability claim under the CFAA is certainly 
possible in certain circumstances where the commissioning party has the requisite knowledge and control over the 
scraper's actions or a party induces another to commit violations of the CFAA. The ruling also suggests that this 
would be true even in the absence of an agency relationship or, as the Ryanair court stated about the defendants' 
alleged relationships in the instant case, even if an agency relationship is expressly disclaimed in any side 
agreement between the commissioning party and the data scraper. The court's ruling is notable in that it suggests 
that a CFAA 'intent to defraud' claim might be pleaded based on actions taken by data scrapers to avoid anti-
scraping technologies, such as rotating or anonymizing IP addresses, changing user agent information, employing 
CAPTCHA solvers, or entering false user login information. It remains to be how future courts would characterize 
specific anti-detection measures under the CFAA. The Supreme Court's Van Buren decision left some issues to be 
further litigated, specifically regarding its description that the clauses of the CFAA should be seen as a 'gates-up-or-
down' inquiry focusing on whether the 'gates' of the computer system were open (i.e., the user in question was 
permitted access), or whether the 'gates' were closed (i.e., the user was not permitted access). But what closes or 
opens the gates? The Ryanair court stated that the inquiry should focus on technical limitations. In the future, if this 
line of reasoning is followed, CFAA authorization questions may be litigated over what specific technical measures 
limiting access are sufficient to lower the gate. In the instant case, the court found that Ryanair's allegations that it 
required a username/password login before access was granted to certain airline ticketing pages was sufficient to 
make a colorable 'unauthorized access' claim under the CFAA. Under this rationale, the onus is on the website or 
database operator to place material that it does not want to be deemed 'public' and beyond the reach of the CFAA 
behind an appropriate technical 'wall.' 
_________________ 
[1][7] In quickly dismissing this claim, the court found that while Ryanair did allege technical interference caused by 
the defendant's scraping, the complaint did not allege that defendants specifically intended to cause any 
interruptions to the site or damage Ryanair's system. 
[2][8] The Delaware court stated: 'Although the Court [in the Van Buren case] declined to expressly decide whether 
that inquiry 'turns only on technological (or 'code-based' limitations) on access, or instead also looks to limits 
contained in contracts or policies,' the Court's ultimate holding—that a police officer did not violate the CFAA when 
he accessed police records for an improper purpose—strongly suggests that the operative question is whether a 
technological or code-based limitation exists to prevent access to a computer by those who do not have proper 
authorization.' 
[3][9] Indeed, in Van Buren, the Supreme Court stated that liability under both the 'without authorization' and 
'exceeds authorized access' clauses stems from a 'gates-up-or-down' inquiry—one either can or cannot access a 
computer system, and one either can or cannot access certain areas within the system. When the 'gate' is up or 
down, however, was not fully clarified by the Supreme Court, as it dropped the semi-notorious Footnote 8 in the 
Van Buren opinion, stating: 'For present purposes, we need not address whether this inquiry turns only on 
technological (or 'code-based') limitations on access, or instead also looks to limits contained in contracts or 
policies.' For further discussion of these issues, please see our prior post[2].

Low-cost airline Ryanair has also entered into a cooperation agreement with Amadeus, the booking system 
provider used in many travel agencies.
All Ryanair connections will be bookable on the Amadeus travel platform from the end of 2022, the Irish airline 
announced on Friday. A corresponding contract was signed on the same day.
"We are pleased to announce this partnership with Amadeus, the world's leading travel technology company, 
further expanding Ryanair's offering and enabling corporate customers in particular greater access to our unrivalled 
network of connections, high frequencies, on-time performance, and unbeatable low fares as they return to 
collaborating with colleagues face-to-face," Ryanair's Dara Brady said.
The partnership expands Ryanair's offering and gives business customers in particular better access to the route 
network, it said. Lufthansa had already announced a cooperation with Amadeus in mid-September.
Amadeus belongs to the so-called global distribution systems that travel agencies in particular use for organizing 
and managing air travel and customer data.
"This partnership illustrates the value of our platform for low-cost carriers, offering the airline access to the widest 
network of travel sellers worldwide and the technology to help them get the most out of the indirect channel," Jose-
Luis Aragon, regional vice-president of the air distribution Europe department at Amadeus said.

 Article By Jeffrey D. Neuburger[1]  
Proskauer Rose LLP[2] New Media and Technology Law Blog [3]  
On October 24, 2022, a Delaware district court held that certain claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 
(CFAA) relating to the controversial practice of web scraping were sufficient to survive the defendant's motion to 
dismiss. (Ryanair DAC v. Booking Holdings Inc.[4], No. 20-01191 (D. Del. Oct. 24, 2022)). The opinion potentially 
breathes life into the use of the CFAA to combat unwanted scraping. 
In the case, Ryanair DAC ('Ryanair'), a European low-fare airline, brought various claims against Booking Holdings 
Inc. (and its well-known suite of online travel and hotel booking websites) (collectively, 'Defendants') for allegedly 
scraping the ticketing portion of the Ryanair site. Ryanair asserted that the ticketing portion of the site is only 
accessible to logged-in users and therefore the data on the site is not public data. 
The decision is important as it offers answers (at least from one district court) to several unsettled legal issues 
about the scope of CFAA liability related to screen scraping. In particular, the decision addresses: 
 the potential for vicarious liability under the CFAA (which is important as many entities retain third party service 
providers to perform scraping) 
 how a data scraper's use of evasive measures (e.g., spoofed email addresses, rotating IP addresses) may be 
considered under a CFAA claim centered on an 'intent to defraud' 
 clarification as to the potential role of technical website-access limitations in analyzing CFAA 'unauthorized access' 
liability 
  
To find answers to these questions, the court's opinion distills the holdings of two important CFAA rulings from this 
year - theSupreme Court's holding inVan Burenthat adopted a narrow interpretation of 'exceeds unauthorized 
access' under the CFAA[5]and theNinth Circuit's holding in the screen scrapinghiQcase where that court found that 
the concept of 'without authorization' under the CFAA does not apply to 'public' websites[6]. 
Ryanair's complaint advanced multiple claims under the CFAA including, among others: 
District Court Decision Brings New Life to CFAA to Combat Unwanted Scraping
 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(2)(C), which prohibits 'intentionally access[ing] a computer without authorization or exceed[ing] 
authorized access, and thereby obtain[ing] . . . information from any protected computer,' 
 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(4), which prohibits 'knowingly and with intent to defraud, access[ing] a protected computer 
without authorization, or exceed[ing] authorized access, and by means of such conduct further[ing] the intended 
fraud and obtain[ing] anything of value.'; and 
 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(5)(A), which prohibits 'knowingly caus[ing] the transmission of aprogram and as a result of such 
conduct, intentionally caus[ing] damage without authorization, to a protected computer.'[1] 
  
The defendants argued that Ryanair's complaint must be dismissed for several reasons: (1) that the CFAA does not 
permit claims to be brought on a vicarious liability theory; (2) that Ryanair has not alleged that the defendants have 
caused the requisite harm for a viable CFAA claim; (3) that Ryanair did not sufficiently plead its CFAA claim based 
on an intent to defraud; and (4) that Ryanair's CFAA 'without authorization' claim fails on the merits in light of the 
principles ofVan BurenandhiQ. 
Vicarious liability under the CFAA 
According to the plaintiff's amended complaint, the defendants entered into numerous contracts with non-party 
scraping providers to bypass the technical and non-technical barriers on the Ryanair site and perform the scraping 
at issue. Ryanair's complaint asserts that 'Defendants cannot avoid CFAA liability by engaging agents and third 
parties to exceed the Defendants' authorized access to the Ryanair Website on their behalf.' 
The defendants argued that Ryanair could not rely on a theory of indirect or vicarious liability in bringing a civil claim 
under the CFAA, contending that the statute permits a civil action 'against the violator,' that is, the individuals who 
actually take the actions at issue. Ryanair contended that CFAA liability extends beyond the persons who directly 
access a computer unlawfully and to those who direct, encourage, or induce a third party to commit such violation. 
In finding Ryanair's vicarious civil claims were cognizable under the CFAA, the district court pointed to a bevy of 
decisions that have recognized that vicarious or indirect liability under the CFAA extends to parties who direct, 
encourage, induce, or conspire with others to commit acts that violate the statute. While the court conceded that 
there is a body of case law that stands for the more limited proposition that a principal is not vicariously liable for an 
agent's CFAA violation if the principal had no knowledge of or involvement in the agent's conduct, the court found in 
the instant case that Ryanair alleged that the defendants directed third parties to access the myRyanair portion of 
the Ryanair website without authorization, and therefore would have had the requisite knowledge. Moreover, the 
court noted that Ryanair allegations that defendants 'entered into written agreements with their agents and certain 
third parties who access the Ryanair Website without authorization (or alternatively, in excess of their authorized 
access) on behalf of the Defendants' supported a plausible vicarious claim. As such, the district court found that a 
vicarious liability claim under the CFAA was adequately pleaded at this stage. 
CFAA 'Intent to Defraud' Claim Based on Evasive Scraping Practices 
Ryanair's complaint alleges a violation of 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(4), which prohibits 'knowingly and with an intent to 
defraud access[ing] a protected computer without authorization.' Examining the issue of whether the federal Rule 
9(b) heightened pleading standards for fraud claims apply to this type of CFAA claim, the court declared that 'the 
law on this issue is a mess.' Sidestepping the question, the court found Ryanair's CFAA 'intent to defraud' claim to 
be sufficiently pleaded under any standard, concluding that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the defendants 
'engaged in fraudulent conduct by misrepresenting themselves, for example by 'lying about [their] email address[es] 
or anonymizing [their] IP address[es],' when creating accounts on the Ryanair website' and using fake user names 
to avoid detection from Ryanair's anti-bot programs. 
Access 'Without Authorization': ClarifyingVan Buren 
Contending that Ryanair's 'unauthorized access' claim should be dismissed on the merits, the defendants argued 
that the Ryanair website is a public website, to which the CFAA's concept of 'authorization' or 'authorized access' 
does not apply; Ryanair countered that the portion of its website where tickets may be booked is not public and 
requires a customer login and that, regardless, the defendants were not authorized to access the that portion of the 
Ryanair website. 
Citing the Supreme Court'sVan Burendecision and the Ninth Circuit'shiQopinion, the Delaware court stated that 
'recent case law interpreting the CFAA makes clear that the CFAA's concept of authorization focuses heavily on 
technological barriers to access'[2], an interpretation bolstered by thehiQcourt's differentiation of a public website 
and one 'protected by [a] username and password authentication system.' As the Ryanair court summed up: 
District Court Decision Brings New Life to CFAA to Combat Unwanted Scraping
'The above cases make clear that in order for the CFAA's 'without authorization' and 'exceeds authorized access' 
elements to apply, some sort of authentication mechanism (e.g., the use of usernames and passwords) must be 
employed to limit access to the website. If the information on the website is publicly available without requiring 
users to authenticate themselves, a violation of the terms of use or the defiance of a cease-and-desist letter will not 
give rise to liability under the CFAA. 
Thus, for a website to fall under CFAA protections, the court said, it must have erected limitations on access 
(whereas, if a website is made available to the public without any authentication requirement, the concept of 
'without authorization' is inapplicable).[3] 
Applying these principles, the Delaware court noted that Ryanair alleges that users must login to the myRyanair 
portion of the Ryanair website using a username and password. Further, Ryanair alleged and that it used technical 
measures to attempt to block software bots engaging in scraping of the site (measures which were allegedly 
bypassed by the defendants). Ryanair's amended complaint further alleged that the defendants circumvented code-
based authentication mechanisms designed to limit access to the myRyanair portion of the website, in violation of 
the terms and even after receiving cease-and-desist letters revoking access. As the Ryanair court concluded: 
'Although those allegations would be insufficient to establish liability under the CFAA if the contents of the 
myRyanair portion of the website were accessible to the public without authentication, courts have found cease-
and-desist letters to withdraw authorization to access a protected portion of a website when an authentication 
mechanism protected access to that portion of the website.' 
Thus, the Delaware court allowed the 'unauthorized access' claims to go forward as Ryanair had raised a plausible 
claim as to whether the myRyanair portion of its website was non-public, thus making the defendants' continued 
access to those pages unauthorized for purposes of the CFAA. 
Final Thoughts 
There are a number of specific and important observations to discern from the decision: 
 The ruling in theRyanaircase suggests that a cognizable vicarious liability claim under the CFAA is certainly 
possible in certain circumstances where the commissioning party has the requisite knowledge and control over the 
scraper's actions or a party induces another to commit violations of the CFAA. The ruling also suggests that this 
would be true even in the absence of an agency relationship or, as theRyanaircourt stated about the defendants' 
alleged relationships in the instant case, even if an agency relationship is expressly disclaimed in any side 
agreement between the commissioning party and the data scraper. 
 The court's ruling is notable in that it suggests that a CFAA 'intent to defraud' claim might be pleaded based on 
actions taken by data scrapers to avoid anti-scraping technologies, such as rotating or anonymizing IP addresses, 
changing user agent information, employing CAPTCHA solvers, or entering false user login information. It remains 
to be how future courts would characterize specific anti-detection measures under the CFAA. 
 The Supreme Court'sVan Burendecision left some issues to be further litigated, specifically regarding its 
description that the clauses of the CFAA should be seen as a 'gates-up-or-down' inquiry focusing on whether the 
'gates' of the computer system were open (i.e., the user in question was permitted access), or whether the 'gates' 
were closed (i.e., the user was not permitted access). But what closes or opens the gates? TheRyanaircourt stated 
that the inquiry should focus on technical limitations. In the future, if this line of reasoning is followed, CFAA 
authorization questions may be litigated over what specific technical measures limiting access are sufficient to lower 
the gate. In the instant case, the court found that Ryanair's allegations that it required a username/password login 
before access was granted to certain airline ticketing pages was sufficient to make a colorable 'unauthorized 
access' claim under the CFAA. Under this rationale, the onus is on the website or database operator to place 
material that it does not want to be deemed 'public' and beyond the reach of the CFAA behind an appropriate 
technical 'wall.' 
  
_________________ 
FOOTNOTES 
[1]In quickly dismissing this claim, the court found that while Ryanair did allege technical interference caused by the 
defendant's scraping, the complaint did not allege that defendants specifically intended to cause any interruptions to 
the site or damage Ryanair's system. 
[2]The Delaware court stated: 'Although the Court [in theVan Burencase] declined to expressly decide whether that 
inquiry 'turns only on technological (or 'code-based' limitations) on access, or instead also looks to limits contained 
in contracts or policies,' the Court's ultimate holding—that a police officer did not violate the CFAA when he 
District Court Decision Brings New Life to CFAA to Combat Unwanted Scraping
accessed police records for an improper purpose—strongly suggests that the operative question is whether a 
technological or code-based limitation exists to prevent access to a computer by those who do not have proper 
authorization.' 
[3]Indeed, inVan Buren, the Supreme Court stated that liability under both the 'without authorization' and 'exceeds 
authorized access' clauses stems from a 'gates-up-or-down' inquiry—one either can or cannot access a computer 
system, and one either can or cannot access certain areas within the system. When the 'gate' is up or down, 
however, was not fully clarified by the Supreme Court, as it dropped the semi-notorious Footnote 8 in theVan 
Burenopinion, stating: 'For present purposes, we need not address whether this inquiry turns only on technological 
(or 'code-based') limitations on access, or instead also looks to limits contained in contracts or policies.' For further 
discussion of these issues, please see ourprior post[5].

 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - November 11, 2022 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], Gol Linhas 
GOL[2], Frontier Group ULCC[3], American Airlines AAL[4] and Copa Holdings CPA[5]. Here are highlights from 
Thursday's Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Roundup: Earnings, Traffic and More In the past week, Ryanair Holdings 
reported lower-than-expected earnings per share for second-quarter fiscal 2023 due to high costs. 
Gol Linhas posted a 40.9% year-over-year increase in consolidated traffic, reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand. 
Hurricane Nicole was the latest weather-related disruption to hurt airline operations. An expansion-related update 
was also available at Frontier Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Frontier Group, in the past week. Recap of 
the Latest Top Stories 1, Ryanair's second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Sep 30, 2022), earnings of $5.32 per share 
(excluding 55 cents from non-recurring items) missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.43. Revenues of 
$4,046.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,023.8. Revenues surged 92.3% year over year driven by 
upbeat passenger volumes. 
On the back of a buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €1371 million in first-half fiscal 2023 against 
a net loss of €48 million incurred a year ago. In the same time period, operating costs surged 126% to €4.98 billion, 
due to a 205% increase in fuel expenses to €1 billion. 
Average fares in the first half of fiscal 2023 were up 7% from the corresponding pre-COVID level. The same was up 
14% in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Net debt at RYAAY declined to €0.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second 
quarter from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
In first-half fiscal 2023, RYAAY's revenues surged 207% year over year to €2.15 billion on the back of buoyant 
traffic. Scheduled revenues in the same period increased 250% to €4.42 billion. 
The number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes were 95.1 million in the first half, up 143% from the same 
period's level in the last fiscal year. The traffic was 11% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load factor in first-half 
fiscal 2023 was 94% compared with 39% in the previous fiscal year's comparable period. 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Ryanair , Gol Linhas, Frontier Group , American Airlines and Copa Holdings
Ryanair upped its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 168 million from 165 million. The new guidance indicates a 13% 
growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. Management expects profit after tax in fiscal 2023 in a range of €1 
billion to €1.20 billion. The guidance is dependent on RYAAY not experiencing any adverse events this winter. In 
fact, management has warned that recovery for the remainder of fiscal 2023 may be impacted by new Covid 
variants or adverse geopolitical events. 
RYAAY was also in the news recently, when it reported upbeat traffic results for October. The story was reported in 
detail in the last week's write-up[6]. 
2. In October, Gol Linhas' consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 2.9 percentage points 
to 81.4% with traffic growth (40.9%) lagging the capacity expansion of 46% year over year. The upbeat traffic in its 
domestic markets is leading to a rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In October, domestic traffic and capacity 
improved 30.2% and 26%, respectively. On the domestic front, 26% more passengers boarded GOL's flights in 
October 2022. Domestic load factor was 81.6%. The volume of departures and seats on the domestic front 
increased 30.9% and 31.1%, respectively. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
.3. To expand its network, Frontier Airlines reportedly[8] announced new routes serving Phoenix and Dallas-Fort 
Worth. Last Friday, Frontier launched its base at Phoenix. Following the launch, the carrier is operating daily flights 
connecting Phoenix with Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Detroit and Orange County, California. Frontier will operate 
flights to Cincinnati four times a week.ULCC also aims to expand its presence in Dallas-Fort Worth this spring. 
4. With Nicole strengthening from a tropical storm to a hurricane, American Airlines has decided to waive change 
fees for flights connected to 20 airports in Florida, Georgia, the Bahamas and Providenciales in the Turks and 
Caicos Islands. Due to hurricane Nicole, multiple flights connecting the Charlotte Douglas international airport and 
the airports mainly in Florida and Georgia were cancelled. This is causing untold harassment to passengers and 
deals a blow to airlines, already suffering labor woes. Performance Even though most airline stocks have traded in 
the red over the five trading days, the losses were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
increased, albeit marginally, to $58.79 over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index has plummeted 20%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keenly await the third-quarter 
2022 earnings report of the Latin American carrier Copa Holdings, scheduled to be out on Nov 16. 
We expect CPA's performance to have been aided by the improving air-travel demand in Latin America. However, 
high fuel costs are likely to have impeded the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Why Haven't

Nov 10, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported lower-than-expected earnings per sharefor second-quarter 
fiscal 2023 due to high costs. Gol Linhas GOL[2] posted a 40.9% year-over-year increase in consolidated traffic, 
reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand. Hurricane Nicole was the latest weather-related disruption to hurt airline 
operations. An expansion-related update was also available at Frontier Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Frontier Group ULCC[3], in the past week. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1, Ryanair's second-quarter fiscal 2023 
(ended Sep 30, 2022), earnings of $5.32 per share (excluding 55 cents from non-recurring items) missed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $5.43. Revenues of $4,046.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,023.8. 
Revenues surged 92.3% year over year driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
On the back of a buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €1371 million in first-half fiscal 2023 against 
a net loss of €48 million incurred a year ago. In the same time period, operating costs surged 126% to €4.98 billion, 
due to a 205% increase in fuel expenses to €1 billion. 
Average fares in the first half of fiscal 2023 were up 7% from the corresponding pre-COVID level. The same was up 
14% in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Net debt at RYAAY declined to €0.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second 
quarter from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
In first-half fiscal 2023, RYAAY's revenues surged 207% year over year to €2.15 billion on the back of buoyant 
traffic. Scheduled revenues in the same period increased 250% to €4.42 billion. 
The number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes were 95.1 million in the first half, up 143% from the same 
period's level in the last fiscal year. The traffic was 11% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load factor in first-half 
fiscal 2023 was 94% compared with 39% in the previous fiscal year's comparable period. 
Ryanair upped its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 168 million from 165 million. The new guidance indicates a 13% 
growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. Management expects profit after tax in fiscal 2023 in a range of €1 
billion to €1.20 billion. The guidance is dependent on RYAAY not experiencing any adverse events this winter. In 
fact, management has warned that recovery for the remainder of fiscal 2023 may impacted by new Covid variants 
or adverse geopolitical events. 
RYAAY was also in the news recently, when it reported upbeat traffic results for October. The story was reported in 
detail in the last week's write-up[4]. 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Q2 Earnings Miss, GOL 's October Traffic
2. In October, Gol Linhas' consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 2.9 percentage points 
to 81.4% with traffic growth (40.9%) lagging the capacity expansion of 46% year over year. The upbeat traffic in its 
domestic markets is leading to a rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In October, domestic traffic and capacity 
improved 30.2% and 26%, respectively. On the domestic front, 26% more passengers boarded GOL's flights in 
October 2022. Domestic load factor was 81.6%. The volume of departures and seats on the domestic front 
increased 30.9% and 31.1%, respectively. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
.3. To expand its network, Frontier Airlines reportedly[6] announced new routes serving Phoenix and Dallas-Fort 
Worth. Last Friday, Frontier launched its base at Phoenix. Following the launch, the carrier is operating daily flights 
connecting Phoenix with Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Detroit and Orange County, California. Frontier will operate 
flights to Cincinnati four times a week.ULCC also aims to expand its presence in Dallas-Fort Worth this spring. 
4. With Nicole strengthening from a tropical storm to a hurricane, American Airlines AAL[7] has decided to waive 
change fees for flights connected to 20 airports in Florida, Georgia, the Bahamas and Providenciales in the Turks 
and Caicos Islands. Due to hurricane Nicole, multiple flights connecting the Charlotte Douglas international airport 
and the airports mainly in Florida and Georgia were cancelled. This is causing untold harassment to passengers 
and deals a blow to airlines, already suffering labor woes. Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that even though most airline stocks have traded in the red over the five trading days, the 
losses were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased, albeit marginally, to $58.79 
over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 20%. 
What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keenly await the third-quarter 2022 earnings report of the Latin 
American carrier Copa Holdings CPA[8], scheduled to be out on Nov 16. 
We expect CPA's performance to have been aided by the improving air-travel demand in Latin America. However, 
high fuel costs are likely to have impeded the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

Strikes Flare In Europe As Cost Of Living Spirals

Nov 09, 2022( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 European workers squeezed by the soaring cost of living went on strike in Belgium and Greece on Wednesday, 
with stoppages threatening to paralyse parts of Britain, France and Spain in coming days. 
Spreading industrial unrest poses a problem for governments which are already spending billions trying to blunt the 
worst effects of rising prices, at least for the most vulnerable. 
Europe is acutely affected by the fall-out of the war in Ukraine, which is exacerbating a global energy crisis, inflation 
and a scarcity of some food products. 
The onset of winter, when energy bills spike, and repeated predictions of a looming, continent-wide recession are 
souring the labour mood even further. 
Belgium and Greece saw general strikes on Wednesday, disrupting transport in their respective capitals, impacting 
businesses. 
In Brussels, home to the European Commission and other EU institutions, workers were protesting inflation running 
higher than 12 percent -- well above the 10.7 percent average across the eurozone. 
The country's biggest union, the FGTB, is demanding greater leeway to negotiate pay rises.  
But the Belgian government counters that Belgian salaries are already indexed to inflation -- an arrangement not 
seen in most other countries. 
The strike cut train services by 75 percent and closed the airport in the southern city of Charleroi, the main hub in 
the country for Europe's leading airline Ryanair. 
In Greece, ferries serving its many islands were among the transport lines halted by a general strike, the second to 
hit the country since September. 
Greek unions are insisting on salary rises to cope with inflation which nationally has risen to 12 percent. 
"The cost of living is untenable," read a large poster for the country's biggest union, the GSEE, calling for "social 
protection for all". 
Stoppages were to be felt on Thursday in Britain and France, with the underground urban rail networks and busses 
in London and Paris to be severely affected. 
A French union leader, Celine Verzeletti of the CGT confederation, predicted up to 200 "demonstration points", 
roughly the same as the last national strike in France, on October 18, when more than 100,000 people protested. 
Strikes Flare In Europe As Cost Of Living Spirals
France is not as badly affected by inflation as its European peers, as the state holds stakes in the main energy 
companies and has minimised how far energy bills can rise. 
Inflation in France is just over six percent -- better than elsewhere -- but with economic activity across the eurozone 
nosediving, hatches are being battened for what looks like a period of stagflation. 
In Britain, where inflation is above 10 percent, worker protests over not being able to make ends meet are coming 
to a crescendo. 
The Bank of England predicts the country is headed for a two-year recession, even though it was forced to hike 
interest rates, making it even tougher for UK households. 
On top of Thursday's stoppage in London's Underground, British nurses are to hold the first strike in the 106-year 
history of their RCN union at a date yet to be announced. 
Late next week, hundreds of workers at Heathrow airport are to down tools for three days, between November 18 
and 21, to demand better pay. 
Their action could force the cancellation of flights to Qatar, which is to host the World Cup football tournament that 
kicks off on November 20. 
British dockers, university staff, postal employees and the legal profession have all held, or threaten to continue 
strikes over pay eaten away by inflation. 
In Spain, truck drivers have called an indefinite strike from next Monday. Their last stoppage, in March, led to empty 
supermarket shelves. 
With labour protests mounting, the EU is looking at ways to take some of the sting out of energy prices. 
The European Commission and member states are working on proposals to promote the joint purchase of gas and 
possibly impose a mechanism to cap the price of wholesale gas within the EU. 
Details are not expected to be finalised until late this month, but the steps -- and unseasonably warm weather last 
month -- contributed to a fall in gas prices, though they are expected to rise again as winter bites. 
The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last week a "mild" eurozone recession looked 
likely -- but warned it would not be enough to bring down record-high inflation.

Two well-received acquisitions pushed Viatris to the top of the S&P 500 index with the healthcare group announcing 
that it was buying Oyster Point Pharma and Famy Life Sciences for a combined price of between $700mn and 
$750mn.
Viatris, which plans to create an ophthalmology franchise with these purchases, said the two companies had the 
potential to add at least $1bn in sales and $500mn in adjusted core profits by 2028.
Ophthalmic diseases specialist Oyster Point Pharma also rallied off the back of this news, having accepted a $11 
per share upfront bid - a 32 per cent premium on Friday's closing price.
Oyster stockholders were eligible for a further $2 per share from Viatris contingent on the group achieving certain 
metrics based on full-year 2022 performance.
Facebook owner Meta rallied in anticipation that it would be reducing its overheads by cutting thousands of jobs.
Budget airline Ryanair, which delisted from the London Stock Exchange last December, climbed on Wall Street 
after reporting half-year profits of (EURO)1.37bn against a loss of (EURO)48mn a year earlier.
Ryanair benefited from "record" second-quarter traffic and "robust summer fares" that were 14 per cent up on pre-
Covid pricing, it said. Ray Douglas

Highlight: British firm Eagle Aviation has purchased the business and assets of Groundcare Solutions, a UK-based 
luggage handling agent. Groundcare Solutions currently repatriates around 1000-1500 bags every day with 90% of 
baggage returned within 24 hours.
Body
The acquisition secures 80 jobs - taking Eagle Aviation's headcount to beyond 200 - with plans to continue growth 
through new hires planned across the network in both London and Scotland. Operations manager for Eagle 
Aviation, Samuel Milne, said: "Groundcare Solutions shares our commitment to customer experience and service 
while understanding how frustrating problems with luggage can be. We work in a highly fraught environment - and 
these values resonate with our own, which made the acquisition a perfect fit. 
"The move will welcome many dedicated staff members to our team giving us the scale and resources to expand 
and grow as the industry recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic while providing a service our customers and 
partners can rely on." Eagle Aviation now provides daily service to 33 airports and 120 airline groups, handling and 
returning more than 800,000 bags per year for clients including Emirates, British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Virgin 
Atlantic, Etihad, and Ryanair. The firm sees the acquisition of Groundcare Solutions as a perfect solution to build a 
robust service recovery for Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, further boosting the company's presence after its 
acquisition of Wey Group International in 2018. Milne added: "Eagle Aviation has been able to adapt aspects of 
business quickly throughout recent challenging times. With unpredictable fuel prices and fallout from Brexit and the 
pandemic still playing a major part in our operations, this acquisition will give us the stability to delve into all the 
possibilities the current market conditions present. "We're proud to play an even bigger role in the repatriation chain 
across the country following the acquisition of Groundcare Solutions and feel very pleased that our airline partners 
trust us with this work on their behalf". Launched in 2020, Eagle Aviation covers all of the main English, Welsh, and 
Scottish regional airports as well as Belfast and Dublin.

Ryanair has given further evidence of its strong recovery from the pandemic, swinging to a first-half profit and 
raising its full-year passenger forecast.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline yesterday reported a pre-tax profit of (EURO)1.42bn for the six months to 
September 30, against a (EURO)100mn loss in the same period last year.
It also forecast a return to full-year profitability for the first time since the start of Covid-19 restrictions. It is expecting 
post-tax profits of between (EURO)1bn and (EURO)1.2bn for its 2022-23 fiscal year, with losses in the quieter 
second half of the year cancelling out some of the first-half profits.
The shares closed up 14 cents - just over 1 per cent - at (EURO)12.30.
Ryanair has been relatively unaffected by the operational problems and the Heathrow airport passenger restrictions 
that hit some rivals during the summer.
Its revenues for the half-year were (EURO)6.62bn, three times the (EURO)2.15bn for the six months to September 
30 last year, when airlines were still affected by coronavirus restrictions. The figure is 23 per cent higher than for the 
same period in 2019.
It has also increased its forecast for passenger traffic for the year to March 31 to 168mn, from 166.5mn.
Carrier swings to profit and raises outlook Ryanair uplift
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair was experiencing "surprisingly strong bookings" for the current, third 
quarter.
He told the Financial Times he thought booking levels reflected a mixture of gains from rivals such as easyJet that 
have cut back operations, and trading down by travellers. Robert Wright Angel Garcia/Bloomberg

RYANAIR yesterday remained cautious about its future despite posting record half-year earnings.
Driven by exceptional summer traffic, the low-cost carrier's after tax earnings jumped to (EURO)1.37bn (£1.20bn) - 
up from a (EURO)48m net loss last year.
While slightly below analysts' consensus, this was the firm's highest half-year results ever, as it surpassed the 
record-making (EURO)1.29bn of 2017.
Ryanair passenger numbers rose 143 per cent to 95.1m for the six months ended 30 September, while load factor 
increased by 15 percentage points.
"We're going into the second half of the year to December and March operating at 110 per cent to pre-Covid 
capacity [while] all of our competitors are running at less than their pre-Covid capacity," chief executive Michael 
O'Leary told analysts.
Over the last few months, Ryanair capitalised on its ability to provide a more reliable service to passengers during 
this summer's travel chaos, while expanding its network and maintaining lower fares.
O'Leary added that Christmas continued to look strong in both passenger volumes and average fare level. 
Nevertheless, the carrier was cautious about future profitability as it was expecting its winter season to be loss-
making, in the range of between (EURO)100m and (EURO)200m.

Airborne Russia domestic air travel returns to near pre-Covid levels but safety worries grow
Airborne Russia domestic air travel returns to near pre-Covid levels but 
safety worries grow

Russia's aviation industry has defied predictions it would grind to a halt after western sanctions barred access to 
spare parts and maintenance expertise.
Domestic air travel has rebounded close to levels last seen before the Covid-19 pandemic, triggering concerns 
among western executives that safety may eventually be put at risk.
Since Russia lifted all pandemicrelated travel curbs in the summer, domestic flights have surged and were up 4 per 
cent on 2019 levels in October, according to data from IBA, an aviation consultancy.
International travel is far below 2019 levels as most western countries banned Russian airlines from their airspace 
following the invasion of Ukraine. Travel has continued to countries such as China, Turkey and former Soviet Union 
states.
The domestic rebound, however, has triggered fears about long-term safety. Airbus and Boeing in March 
suspended the supply of spares and services and removed regular maintenance support, as did engine makers 
including Rolls-Royce.
Before the start of the war, the two aerospace groups accounted for 70 per cent of Russia's commercial fleet of 
roughly 880 aircraft, according to data from Cirium, a consultancy.
Airborne Russia domestic air travel returns to near pre-Covid levels but safety worries grow
The market is dominated by western lessors that provided domestic airlines with more than 500 planes but have 
retrieved few of them.
Guillaume Faury, chief executive of Airbus, said last month: "We are worried about the conditions for maintenance 
as actually the planes are flying a lot.
"Because of the sanctions, we cannot really monitor and support as ... in normal times. And that's ... creating some 
concerns on the safety side." Phil Seymour, president of IBA, said most western-made aircraft can operate without 
too much maintenance in the short term, but Russian authorities "would not want planes to fly in an un-airworthy 
condition".
For those due a "major six-year or 12-year check, then the operator will have a problem. Spare parts, tooling and 
equipment are all quite specialist," he said.
As time runs on, Russian airlines would have to cannibalise some aircraft or source components from other 
countries, executives said.
Moscow's decision to deregister the western-owned aircraft has complicated their future. Under western 
regulations, each aircraft has a servicing guide that details every modification made and needs to be kept up to 
date. "There is a difference between whether the aircraft can still fly OK and whether it meets international safety 
standards," one executive said. Ryanair uplift page 14

One low-cost airline is sitting on a pot o' gold that could grow even bigger this holiday season thanks to some 
unmagical economic headwinds. Begorrah! 
Irish budget airline Ryanair reported a profit of €1.4 billion from April to September on Monday thanks to record 
numbers of passengers paying higher prices than ever. CEO Michael O'Leary said in August Ryanair planned to 
hijack sales from more expensive airlines as the shadow of recession looms, although he warned growth was "still 
very fragile and prone to falling over" - unlike their planes, we hope. 
Austerity Holidaying 
Inflationary pressures and staff shortages have driven up airline tickets across the board, and Ryanair is no 
exception. Passengers flying with the inspiration behind the internet-famous Irish ballad "Cheap Flights"[2] now pay 
14% more for tickets than pre-pandemic. Airlines including Ryanair have forecast strong demand over the 
Christmas period, as two years of covid restrictions means even cash-strapped consumers are willing to pay for a 
holiday -- they'll just shell out less than in a usual year. Remember those? 
Flush with cash, Ryanair seems to be taking an evil leprechaun approach to its competitors. O'Leary said the 
company sees EasyJet and Wizz Air as potential acquisition targets over the next few years, declaring they are "not 
able to compete with us on cost or pricing." EasyJet and Wizz Air have also benefited from the recent surge in 
demand for cheap flights, but they're way behind Ryanair on their balance sheets: 
EasyJet's CEO said its Q3 is "one of the best quarters in easyJet's history" generating up to 685 million in profits, 
but it still expects to chalk up its third annual loss in a row. Parvenu Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air widened its 
H1 losses between this year and last year by €11.9 million. The airline's CEO claims its financials are now 
stabilizing, however, as the second financial quarter saw a profit, and its H1 revenues have ballooned from €880 
million to €2.19 billion. 
As rivals play catch-up Ryanair is looking to add to its advantage, claiming it will offer more seats to vacation-
starved Europeans than its competitors. "Most of our EU competitors have cut capacity by up to 20% this Winter 
while Ryanair will offer 10% more seats than pre-COVID," Ryanair said in its earnings release. 
Budget Airline Ryanair Posts Record-Breaking Profits
Back in the Former USSR: The Russian domestic flight market has remained robust, which could leave passengers 
playing Russian roulette. The industry is flying high despite being largely cut off from Western suppliers who sell the 
parts it needs to maintain its planes, prompting fears that safety on Russian flights will deteriorate along with its 
aging aircraft.

Analysts at Peel Hunt have picked the numbers of Joules and placed forecasts under review after the clothing 
retailer announced yesterday that trading conditions and retail margin had fallen behind expectations following a 
few difficult months. At the end of October, net debt was £25.7m, which left headroom of £11.4m. The £5m short-
term extension to the RFCA is unlikely to be repaid.
Ryanair exceeded analysts' expectations when it posted its half-year results. Following a record summer traffic, the 
low-cost carrier raised passengers' forecast to 168m, while revenue per passenger was at (EURO)80.94 - 2.5 per 
cent ahead of Peel Hunt's expectations of (EURO)78.95. Ryanair now expects its full-year profits to be between 
(EURO)1bn and (EURO)1.2bn assuming there is no recurrence of Covid lockdowns.

Ryanair bullishness lifts easyJet and Wizz AIr
Ryanair bullishness lifts easyJet and Wizz AIr

Ryanair give the airline sector a lift today as it reported a swing back into profit at the interim stage and forecast it 
would make at least (EURO)1bn for the full year.
Shares in the Amsterdam-listed airline jumped 7.7% to (EURO)12.99 with its rivals also getting a healthy tailwind 
from the Irish carrier's bullish tone.
Wizz Air shares were up 7%, easyJet by 3% and British Airways owner IAG by 1.7% as investors looked ahead to a 
complete recovery from the sector's Covid nightmare.
Ryanair posted a pre-tax profit of (EURO)1.4bn (£1.2bn) in the six months to the end of September following a net 
loss of (EURO)48m in the same period last year.
Full-year profits will be between (EURO)1bn and (EURO)1.2bn, it said after the traditional winter loss, adding that it 
did not expect to be affected by the cost-of-living crisis.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said he hoped the sector would avoid a repeat of last year's lockdowns caused by 
the omicron variant, "which damaged last Christmas at such short notice.
"Concerns about the impact of recession and rising consumer price inflation on Ryanair's business model have 
been greatly exaggerated."
O'Leary said he expects the airline "to grow strongly in a recession as consumers won't stop flying, but rather they 
will become more price sensitive."
Ryanair bullishness lifts easyJet and Wizz AIr
That will mean a fierce battle for passengers with people shopping around for the best deals.
Ryanair said it flew 95mln passengers in its first half, up from 39mln one year earlier.
That was 11% more than the 85.7mln in the same period in 2019 before Covid grounded almost all air travel.
Revenue hit (EURO)6.62bn in the six-month period, up from (EURO)2.15bn in 2021.
Dublin-based Ryanair added it will increase its seat numbers by 10% this winter and predicted annual passenger 
numbers would hit 168mln, which would be a new record by some distance.
O'Leary said another Covid outbreak might derail its forecasts, while longer-term it is reliant on Boeing delivering 
more than 50 new planes by next summer but otherwise he was upbeat about the future.

Airlines face fragile winter Ryanair CEO says after record summer profits

Ryanair on Monday reported record summer profits, but CEO Michael O'Leary warned that the winter is likely to be 
"very fragile."
"We look set for a strong winter but I'm conscious last year we had omicron at the end of November which crushed 
Christmas and the Ukraine invasion crushed Easter," O'Leary told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday.
The Irish airline posted its largest ever after-tax profit for the six months to September at 1.37 billion euros ($1.37 
billion) on Monday.
There was an expectation that demand could shrink as the cost-of-living crisis takes its toll on household budgets 
across Europe, but appetite for travel is still there, he said.
"We've been waiting for demand to tighten up but we've not seen it yet - but there is a fragility there," O'Leary told 
CNBC. "[People] were locked up for two years [during the Covid-19 pandemic], travel is one of the things they're 
going to keep doing," he said.
Future of European air travel
Looking ahead, O'Leary said the "real overhang" for the next two to three years will be higher financing costs as 
interest rates have soared, which will likely cause the disappearance of airlines that can't keep up.
"I think we're going to see in the next four to five years the final consolidation when Europe moves to four large 
airlines, three big connecting carriers and one large low-cost carrier," O'Leary said, with Ryanair filling the "low-cost 
carrier" spot.
Price will be the tipping point for determining which airlines survive in the next decade, according to O'Leary.
"The real barrier to entry to Europe in the next four to five years is going to be 'can you compete with Ryanair at 
£9.99?' and if you can't, then don't try," he said.
Seismic change
Airlines face fragile winter Ryanair CEO says after record summer profits
Ryanair committed to being carbon neutral by 2050 in March, but supplies for sustainable aviation fuels remain 
small, according to O'Leary.
The airline is adding more Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to its fleet, which are capable of carrying 4% more passengers 
and burn 16% less fuel, although production has been delayed due to supply chain issues.
New engine technology is another way the sector will eventually improve its environmental credentials, but engines 
that could cause "seismic change" in the industry won't be available "before 2030, 2040," O'Leary added.

       Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its profit attributable to equity holders of parent for the half-
year ended September 30, 2022 was 1.26 billion euros or 1.1101 euros per share compared to a net loss of 47.6 
million euros or 0.0422 euros per share in the previous year.
 Pre-Exceptional profit after tax for the period was 1.37 billion euros, compared to a pre-Covid half year profit of 
1.15 billion euros, due to record in the second quarter traffic, strong operational reliability and robust summer fares 
which in the second quarter were 14% up on pre-Covid pricing.
 Total operating revenues for the quarter grew to 6.62 billion euros from 2.15 billion euros in the prior year.
 Ryanair said, while it remains dependent on Boeing meeting their delivery commitments, especially for Christmas 
extras and Spring mid-term, the company modestly raised its fiscal year 2023 traffic guidance to 168 million  
passengers from prior outlook of 166.5 million  passengers.
 Looking ahead for fiscal year 2023, Ryanair expects that it will minimize its  winter losses which would enable the 
company  to deliver an profit after tax (pre-exceptionals) in a range of 1.00 billion euros to 1.20 billion euros.

       Irish ultra low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings reported Monday a strong growth in second-quarter profit with 
strong demand and increase in average fares. Looking ahead for fiscal year 2023, Ryanair expects an adjusted 
profit, and also raised traffic view.
 For fiscal year 2023, Ryanair expects that it will minimize its winter losses which would enable it to record pre-
exceptionals profit after tax in a range of 1.00 billion euros to 1.20 billion euros.
 Ryanair modestly raised its traffic guidance to 168 million passengers from prior outlook of 166.5 million 
passengers. The outlook remains dependent on Boeing meeting their delivery commitments, especially for 
Christmas extras and Spring mid-term. The outlook reflects growth of 13 percent on pre-Covid traffic.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said, "The recovery for the remainder of FY23 remains fragile and could yet be 
impacted by new Covid variants or adverse geopolitical events such as Ukraine. However forward bookings (both 
traffic and fares) remain strong over the Oct. school mid-terms and into the peak Christmas travel period. We hope 
to avoid any repeat of last year's Omicron lockdowns which damaged last Christmas at such short notice."
 In the second quarter, profit before tax surged to 1.22 billion euros from last year's 224.6 million euros.
 Profit attributable to equity holders of parent was 1.08 billion euros or 0.9456 euro per share, compared to 225 
million euros or 0.1975 euro per share in the previous year.
 Pre-Exceptional profit before tax was 1.36 billion euros, and pre-exceptional after tax profit was 1.20 billion euros. 
The results reflected significant growth in traffic, strong operational reliability and robust summer fares.
 Total operating revenues surged 125 percent to 4.01 billion euros from 1.78 billion euros in the prior year.
 Scheduled revenues increased 163 percent to 2.85 billion euros, as traffic recovered strongly. Customers surged 
60 percent to 49.5 million from prior year's 31 million. Average fares were 65 percent higher, while the growth was 
14 percent on the same quarter pre Covid-19.
 Ancillary revenues also climbed 66 percent from last year to 1.17 billion euros.
 In the first half, profit before tax was 1.42 billion euros, compared to loss of 99.9 million euros last year. Total 
operating revenues surged 207 percent to 6.62 billion euros, Scheduled revenues increased 248 percent and 
Ancillary revenues climbed 149 percent.
 Customers surged 143 percent to 95.1 million with strong recovery in summer traffic. Load factor was 94 percent, 
up 15 percentage points from 79 percent a year ago.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday posted half-year results that showed profit, revenue and 
passengers carried all exceeding pre-pandemic levels. 
The Dublin-based budget airline said that, in the six months to September 30, revenue trebled year-on-year to 
EUR6.62 billion from EUR2.15 billion. The recent figure was 23% higher than EUR5.39 billion three years ago, 
meaning before the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Ryanair swung to an interim pretax profit of EUR1.55 billion from a EUR99.9 million loss in the first financial half of 
2021. This beat pre-pandemic profit of EUR1.26 billion. 
Earnings per share rose to EUR1.11 from EUR1.02 three years ago and swung from a loss of EUR0.04 a year ago. 
Ryanair carried 95.1 million customers during the recent six months, more than doubled from 39.1 million a year 
before and exceeding 85.7 million three years ago. The load factor improved to 94% from 79% a year prior but was 
below 96% three years ago. 
Ryanair raised its traffic guidance for its current financial year, which ends on March 31, to 168 million passengers, 
up 13% from 148.6 million three years ago and up 71% from 97.1 million in financial 2022. 
Looking ahead, Ryanair said bookings are strong but the economic situation is "fragile". It also noted that the key 
Easter holiday will be on April 9 and so fall into financial 2024.
"The recovery for the remainder of financial year 2023 remains fragile and could yet be impacted by new Covid 
variants or adverse geopolitical events such as Ukraine. However forward bookings, both traffic and fares remain 
strong over the October school mid-terms and into the peak Christmas travel period. We hope to avoid any repeat 
of last year's Omicron lockdowns which damaged last Christmas at such short notice," Ryanair said. 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair half-year profit surpasses pre-pandemic figures
"As is normal, at this time of year, we have almost zero visibility into the fourth quarter which is traditionally our 
weakest quarter and which this year doesn't have any Easter benefit."

Budget airline Ryanair announced a return to profit for the half-year period which ended on September 30, the 
company reported on Monday.
The Irish airline said its profit was (EURO)1.26 billion ($1.25 billion) or (EURO)1.1 per share, compared to a net 
loss of (EURO)47.6 million or (EURO)0.04 per share in the previous year.
Pre-exceptional profit after tax for the period was (EURO)1.37 billion, compared to a pre-Covid half year profit of 
(EURO)1.15 billion, due to record in the second quarter traffic, strong operational reliability and robust summer 
fares which in the second quarter were 14% up on pre-Covid pricing.
Total operating revenues for the quarter grew to (EURO)6.62 billion, up from (EURO)2.15 billion euros in the prior 
year.
While it remained dependent on Boeing meeting their delivery commitments, Ryanair modestly raised its fiscal year 
2023 traffic guidance to 168 million passengers, up from prior outlook of 166.5 million passengers.
Looking ahead for fiscal year 2023, Ryanair expects that it will minimize its winter losses which would deliver a 
profit after tax (pre-exceptionals) in a range of (EURO)1 billion to (EURO)1.20 billion.

 Climate change is a subject that few needan introduction[1] to. The world is continuing to seelong-term changes in 
temperature and weather patterns, some of which are being driven by humans. The prevalent use of non-renewable 
energy has increased this shift in climate, forming new issues in other markets. One industry that is seeingnew 
obstacles due to climate change is thetravel industry[2].  
Specifically in Europe, rising temperatures make traveling to specific areas in the summer less appealing[2]. Europe 
is home to many of the most visited travel destinations[3] in the world, accounting for two-thirds[4] oftotal 
international arrivals with bothLondon and Paris in the top-ten[3] most visited cities. Travel is also important for the 
European Union's (EU)economy, making up10% of its GDP[5]. In 2021, travel and tourism were responsiblefor 
around 34.65 million jobs[6] in Europe. As the world is reopeningand the pandemic diminishes, the number of 
people traveling to Europe is increasing annually[7], indicating a bright future for this important sector of Europe's 
economy. 
Western Central Europe is one of theregions in the Northern Hemisphere that has faced extreme heat, water 
shortages, and dry soil conditions in thesummer of 2022[8]. Forest fires[9] in France[10], the worst droughts[11] the 
EU has seen in centuries, and record-breaking temperatures are all signalingclimate change in the area. While 
Europe is working through an energy crisis[12], amenities such as air conditioning[13] are regulated by the EU. 
Some popular European destinations such as London do nothave air conditioning[14] due to the historic 
architecture not needing it in the past, making it difficult to support travelers in need of this amenity.European flight 
companies including easyJet[15], Wizz Air[16], and Ryanair[17] are all having to cancel flights due to runways being 
too hot at the London Luton Airport[18]. As the temperatures in the continent continue to get harsher, tourists and 
the companies serving them have started to shift their ways of thinking about international travel. 
Shifts in the travel industry can be seen at many levels. For one, the period when people are traveling is becoming 
wider[2]. Theshoulder season[19] is the month right outside the main window for travel that is becoming more 
stretched every year, and this used to consist ofMay and September. As people are planning their vacations for less 
intense temperatures, the shoulder of the usual tourism season[19] is shifting towards April and October. When the 
temperatures rise, research shows[2] that people do less retail shopping while traveling, adding yet another 
consequence for the local businesses depending on these shoppers. 
While some people are choosingto travel at different times of the year, others are seeking different countries[19]to 
visit.One example is Iceland[20], which has seen a steady increase in tourism[21] in the past 20 years. Jóhannes ór 
Skúlasyn, the director of the Icelandic Tourism Association, says thatmore large hotels[22] are needed to match the 
European Travel is Being Held Back by Climate Change
tourism growth. Iceland's hotel industry is a mix[23] of independent and chain hotels, making a change like this 
have varying impacts on these hotel operations. Companies like Keahotels[24] have received American investment 
during Iceland's tourism boom[25], assisting the brand in keeping up with capital and construction necessary to 
serve this tourism sector.Other countries are also following Iceland's path, withSweden[26], Norway[27], and 
Ireland[28]also seeing increased tourism over the last decade[29]. 
While Europe is working on becoming carbon neutral, climate change will not stop without drastic change. Although 
the patterns in the European travel market are small at the moment, they are predicted to continue increasingover 
the coming years[19]. Whether it is Iceland creating more hotels or England working around the unusual 
temperature increases, the changes in European travel will be more prevalent[19] as the years and changing 
weather goes on.

Ryanair 's FY23 guidance depends on Covid and Boeing

 Ryanair[1]is buoyant that its total number of passengers carried in FY23 will reach a record-high 168 million and 
net profit reach between €1.0 and €1.2 billion. The airline expects to build on a strong HY1, although it takes a 
cautious eye to what happens with Covid and Ukraine this winter. And if Boeing is able to deliver on its promises 
Ryanair's FY23 guidance depends on Covid and Boeing. 
In the March-September period, Ryanair produced a pre-exceptional net profit of €1.263 billion compared to €-47.6 
million in the same period of FY22. The result includes a €-107.4 million loss on jet fuel caps. The carrier generated 
€4.424 billion in passenger revenues and €2.191 billion in ancillary revenues or €23 per passenger. The combined 
€6.616 billion in revenues compares to €2.155 billion last year. Ryanair, Malta Air, Buzz, and Lauda carried a 
combined 95.1 million passengers, up from 39.1 million last year. The load factor was 94 percent, nearing 96 
percent of FY20. 
Looking at HY1 revenues, Italy continues to be the strongest single market, with €1.5 billion earned there, ahead of 
Spain with €1.2 billion and the UK at €980 million. Ireland contributed €377 million and other markets with €2.7 
billion. Total expenses of €5.1 billion include €2.3 billion in fuel costs compared to €713.1 million last year, but as it 
flew more, all other costs were also higher. Costs per passenger were €31. The net profit was €1.515 billion, up 
from €-50.5 million last year. 
In Q2 (June-September), Ryanair benefitted from higher fares, up fourteen percent of FY20, and more than 
offsetting the weak Easter period in Q1 that was affected by lower bookings after the war in Ukraine started. 
Operating at 115 percent capacity over the summer, Q2 revenues jumped to €4.015 billion €1.784 billion in the 
same period last year. Expenses were up by over a billion euros this quarter to €2.739 billion, producing an 
operating profit of €1.276 billion (2021: €254 million) and a net profit of €1.076 billion (€225 million). 
CEO Michael O'Leary was keen to stress that Ryanair didn't suffer from operational or staffing issues of its own 
during the summer, although it suffered from ATC problems and a number of strikes. He claimed a cancelation rate 
of just 0.02 percent of all flights, but these were for the UK flights only. That Ryanair escaped problems has to do 
with crewing up early for this summer and not cutting on crew training and recruitment, 'as we knew there would be 
a recovery.' It caused huge gains in market share, up fourteen percentage points to forty percent now in Italy and to 
thirty percent on Wizz Air's home ground in Hungary (up thirteen percent). For its future growth, the airline needs 
6.000 new staff and is already training over 1.000 pilot cadets right now and recruiting new maintenance staff. 
Ryanair 's FY23 guidance depends on Covid and Boeing
'Impact inflation is exaggerated' 
O'Leary repeated that the coming winter season will be loss-making, as it is its weakest season and another 
Omicron situation or effects from the war in Ukraine could be on their way. However, he isn't somber about the 
economic outlook and downplayed the effects of inflation on his airline. 'Concerns about the impact of recession 
and rising consumer price inflation on Ryanair's business model have been greatly exaggerated in recent months. 
As the lowest-cost producer in Europe, we expect to grow strongly in a recession as consumers won't stop flying, 
but rather they will become more price sensitive. Like (supermarket discounters) Aldi, Lidl, Ikea, and other price 
leaders our very strong post Covid recovery shows that price will continue to drive market share gains as we add 
low-cost, more fuel efficient, aircraft to our fleet over the next four years.' 
O'Leary thinks that Ryanair will benefit more than others from the contraction in short-haul capacity that has 
happened in Europe since the pandemic. 'Most of our EU competitors have cut capacity by up to twenty percent 
this winter while Ryanair will offer ten percent more seats than pre-Covid.' Based on strong bookings in October 
and for the upcoming Christmas period, the airline is optimistic about the current Q3 but says it has 'zero visibility 
into Q4' (January-March) when it trims back capacity to 110 percent. Yet, Ryanair has modestly raised its guidance 
for FY23 and now expects to carry 168 million passengers, up from 166.5 million in its previous guidance and 165 
million in July. Reaching 168 million would be up thirteen percent over pre-pandemic levels.

Worries about MAX deliveries 
If Ryanair succeeds, depends on the arrival of 51 more Boeing MAX 8200 aircraft until next summer. The airline 
currently operates 73 of them but expects only ten or twelve more before the end of the year instead of the planned 
twenty. 'Boeing assures us that they will deliver all scheduled 51 Gamechangers ahead of peak S.23, although 
there is a risk that some of these deliveries could slip,' said O'Leary. This could affect deliveries in Q4 and Q1 in 
FY24, which is the first quarter of the upcoming summer season.  
There is uncertainty if five to ten aircraft are being delivered on time, which would leave Ryanair at 41-45 MAX 
8200s by next summer. 'We are planning FY24 growth based on 51 extra aircraft for peak S.23 and we continue to 
recruit and train substantial numbers of pilots, cabin crew and engineers.' He added: 'Even if Boeing leaves us 
slightly short of aircraft, we have a reasonable chance of getting to 185 million passengers in FY24.' 
Reaching 225 million in FY26 remains the target and is possible without extra aircraft, so there is no pressure the 
order the MAX 10 that Ryanair is keen to have. O'Leary said that he thinks it is vital that US Congress gives Boeing 
an exemption on the December 31 deadline and have it certified without the need for a cockpit systems update: 
'There are thousands and thousands of jobs across North America relying on that extension. We also think it is a 
critical safety issue: we don't want to see two different cockpit types on the MAX.' 
Ryanair's current 409 737-800s will be looking a bit more like the MAX as they will be fitted with identical scimitar 
winglets from the coming winter period. The airline will invest €200 million in a wingtip retrofit as the new version will 
give a 1.5 percent fuel burn improvement per aircraft. In September, Ryanair signed an uptake agreement with 
OMV for 160.000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at airports in Austria, Germany, and Central Europe. This 
complements the uptake agreement with Neste at Amsterdam Schiphol. 
Long-term labor agreements 
The airline says that it has now reached new long-term agreements about pay and rosters that cover ninety percent 
of pilots and cabin crew through 2026-2027. The pay restoration, which was brought forward from 2025 to April next 
year, has been further advanced to the coming December on the back of the strong HY1 results. This restores the 
pay cuts that were agreed upon in 2020 following the Covid crisis. O'Leary called on the remaining ten percent of its 
pilots in Belgium and Ireland to resume negotiations and sign the new agreements. 
Ryanair ended September with €4.6 billion in cash, up one billion from March. Net debt was reduced by a billion to 
€0.5 billion. 'Our focus over the next year is the repayment of €1.6 billion of maturing bonds (in March and August) 
while returning our balance sheet to a broadly zero net debt position' by March 2024. Over ninety percent of its 
current fleet is unencumbered. Capital expenditures for FY24 will be around €2.2 billion, with aircraft purchases 
financed from its own resources and hedged through 2026. The airline has hedged 81 percent of fuel this FY23 and 
currently fifty percent for FY24, with currencies hedged at eighty percent this financial year and twenty percent next 
year.

 In the classic marketing book, The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding, authors Al Ries and Laura Ries state that a 
successful branding program is based on the concept of a singularity.  
It creates in the mind of the prospect the perception that there is no product on the market quite like yours. 
Furthermore they argue that you should strive to own one word in the mind of the consumer - a word that defines 
your brand and what is special about it. 
For example Volvo built its reputation and brand positioning on one word; safety. Volvo became successful first in 
Europe and then in the USA by owning the word 'safety' in the mind of the car buyer. Similarly Mercedes 
represented 'prestige' and BMW, 'The ultimate driving machine.' Once these brands became successful they made 
the common mistake of expanding the brand and therefore weakening its single differentiating property. Volvo 
introduced a sports car. Mercedes launched cheaper models and BMW brought out a staid station wagon. 
Broadening the base and moving into other markets can look attractive but it can fatally weaken the brand. It is 
better to introduce a new brand than to damage the perception of your winner. 
People associated the word Xerox with copiers. They even said 'take a xerox copy of this.' When Xerox launched a 
range of Xerox computers it flopped. The brand is not what the people in the marketing department want it to be. It 
is the perception that exists in the mind of the customer - and once that is established it is hard to change and 
dangerous to meddle with. 
Fedex focused on a single message - overnight delivery. Ryanair positions itself as the cheapest airline. Apple 
represents cool design. Once the positioning is established each new product or line extension should support and 
reinforce the message. If not it is better to start with a separate brand name. Holiday Inn was clearly positioned as 
an inexpensive, value for money hotel chain. It wanted to move upmarket so it launched a range of more expensive 
hotels under the banner, Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza hotels. Expanding the brand with sub-brands is a common 
tactic and is often a mistake. In this case the market was confused. Were the new hotels expensive or were they 
Holiday Inns? Eventually the company got the message and changed the brand name to simply Crowne Plaza. 
By all means innovate but any new product or service which deviates from the single key message of your 
established brand should have a different name or else it might do more harm than good.

Inflation again hangs over the coming week like an unmoving black cloud with the next update on prices in the 
US to dominate the mood at the end.
Companies, too, will have plenty to say on rising raw materials costs, staff wages, the impact of the weak pound 
and the spending mood among customers generally (read the full preview on inflation here).
Monday 7 November
Monday, though, should kick off well enough with the ever-ebullient Michael O'Leary likely to be in good heart if 
some of the recent bullish updates from rival airlines are an indication of how things have been going at Ryanair.
Consolidation is also becoming a watchword in the sector and whether O'Leary sees any value in buying rivals will 
be worth listening out for (for the complete Ryanair preview click here).
Tuesday 8 November
Associated British Foods will be unlikely to be as upbeat. It is in the teeth of the inflation storm at both Primark and 
its food-related businesses.
Clive Black at Shore Capital expects of profits of £1.35bn but advises investors to look through the current 
inflation storm to the longer-term potential for ABF.
Marks & Spencer , AB Foods and Persimmon top next week's agenda
Persimmon kicks off a week of hopeful reassurance from the housebuilders in the face of rising mortgage rates and 
predictions of a major house price correction on the way.
In the US, meanwhile, it's meme stock day as cinema chain AMC (full preview) updates while streaming numbers 
will be the focus at Disney (read the Disney preview in full). 
Wednesday 9 November 
Marks & Spencer also releases interim numbers and inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze will be to the fore.
Shore Capital expects market share gains in food and clothing and household, with like-for-like sales growth of 
6.0% and 10.0% respectively.
The forecast for underlying profits is £199mln (for the complete Marks and Spencer preview click here).
Thursday 10 November
It's a big day for GSK spin-out Haleon. An overhang from the combined 45% stake owned by former parents GSK 
and Pfizer could start to come into play.
When Haleon was spun out as a separately listed company earlier this year, Pfizer held a 32% stake and GSK 
around 13.5%.
They are prevented from selling under a lockup agreement that will be lifted whenever Haleon publishes third-
quarter results or 10 November, whichever happens first (though they happen to be on the same day). The Haleon 
preview in full can be read here.
US inflation numbers are due today and will be watched for any sign that some of the pressure might be easing and 
the Fed can take its foot off the monetary tightening brake (full preview here).
Friday 11 November 
Insurer Beazley brings the company week to a close. Brokers see losses of US$125mln, while French weather 
events seen at the tail end of the second quarter are likely to produce a loss of US$20mln. 
UK GDP numbers meanwhile are predicted to see a further slowing of the economy with shrinkage of between 
0.1% and 0.5% predicted (read the full preview now).

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) will release its latest quarterly results on Monday, 7 November, with UBS 
analysts predicting the airline will see increases in revenue and net income as passenger numbers continue to rise.
UBS analyst Jarrod Castle forecasts Ryanair's quarterly revenue to be roughly (EURO)3.9bn, up from 
(EURO)1.8bn last year, alongside an increase in net income to (EURO)1,218mln from (EURO)225mln. He also 
predicted earnings before tax of (EURO)1,326mln.
In recently published traffic results, Ryanair reported increased footfall of 15.7mln passengers in October 2022, up 
from 11.4mln a year earlier, with the airline consistently seeing increased passenger figures year-on-year.
The October traffic figures represented 94% of seats being filled on its aircraft during the month.
With the aviation industry generally operating below pre-pandemic levels, Ryanair has said: "While we remain 
hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and tourism industry to fully recover and 
finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in Autumn 2022.
Despite this, it added: "Ryanair plans to grow 2023 traffic to 165m (+11% on pre-Covid traffic) and will pursue its 
load active, yield passive strategy to achieve this growth."

Nov 04, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1] reported a wider-than-expected loss per share for third-
quarter 2022 due to high costs. Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] posted upbeat traffic data for October, driven by the 
buoyant air-travel demand scenario. Mirroring the labor woes for U.S. airlines, United Airlines' UAL[3] pilots voted 
down the tentative deal that its union had inked with the airline. 
Read the last Airline roundup here[4]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Allegiant Travel reported a third-quarter 
2022 loss (excluding $2.04 from non-recurring items) of 54 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of a loss of 47 cents. Operating revenues of $560.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $556.6 
million and increased 21.9% on a year-over-year basis. 
Passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk (92.2%) of the top line, rose 21.9% on a year-over-year basis. The 
upside can be attributed to improved air-travel demand. Air traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles or RPMs) 
for scheduled service climbed 15.7% in the quarter under review. Capacity (measured in available seat miles or 
ASMs) inched up 0.1% year over year. Load factor increased 1190 basis points to 88.5% in the reported quarter as 
traffic surge outweighed capacity expansion. 
Operating cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel and effects of Hurricane Ian, for the total system 
escalated to 7.81 cents from 6.18 cents a year ago. Average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) shot up in excess of 
75% to $3.84 in the quarter. Total scheduled service passenger revenue per available seat miles rose 21.2% to 
12.60 cents. ALGT exited the September quarter with 116 planes in its fleet. Fleet size at the end of 2022 is 
expected to be 123. 
For fourth-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon is expected to be $3.75. Total operating revenues are likely to increase 
in the 26.5-28.5% band from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to increase in the 13-15% 
range. Capacity for scheduled service and total system are likely to increase 13.5% and 15%, respectively, from 
respective fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. 
2. In October, RYAAY flew 15.7 million passengers, the highest-ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. 
Last October, only 11.4 million passengers were transported by RYAAY. Load factor increased to 94% from 84% in 
October 2021. The number of passengers attracted by RYAAY in October 2022 was 14% higher than the 13.1 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALGT's Q3 Loss, RYAAY 's Rosy Traffic in October & More
million passengers flown in October 2019 (pre-coronavirus era). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
.3. Pilots at United Airlines, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, voted against a pay-related tentative deal 
inked a few months ago. 9,980 UAL pilots participated in the voting procedure with an overwhelming 94% casting 
votes against the deal. They believed that the terms fell short of their expectations. Pilots will now commence a 
series of informational picketing events to convince UAL to resume talks to finalize an agreement. 
4. In a similar development, American Airlines' AAL[6] pilots reportedly[7] voted down an offer by the company as 
they believe, the current offer does not match their expectations. Per the Allied Pilots Association, the union 
representing the pilots, its board voted down the offer 15-5. The turned-down proposal included pay raises of 19% 
in three steps over a two-year duration. The rejection highlights labor problems for U.S. airlines as they grapple with 
pilot shortage in the face of a strong rebound in air-travel demand. 
 Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months.

The table above shows that even though most airline stocks have traded in the red over the five trading days, the 
losses were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased, albeit marginally, to $58.35 
over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 23.2%..

The ch-aviation capacities module shows the Latvian capital is currently dominated by local carrier airBaltic (BT, 
Riga), which has a 58.7% market share by scheduled weekly capacity. While Norwegian is the third-largest carrier 
at the airport (also behind Ryanair), its share is a meagre 3.4% (split between the Norwegian and Norwegian Air 
Sweden AOC).
The airline currently has bases in the Nordics (Bergen, Billund, Oslo Gardermoen, Stavanger, Stockholm Arlanda, 
Trondheim, Copenhagen Kastrup, and Helsinki Vantaa) and Spain (Alicante, Barcelona El Prat, and Malaga), the 
ch-aviation PRO airlines module shows.
Norwegian's growth will be fuelled by its ambitious fleet ramp-up programme. The carrier said it secured an 
additional eleven new B737-8s "at competitive terms" for delivery ahead of the Summer 2024 season, on top of 
fifteen aircraft of the type signed from AerCap with deliveries by 2023 and fifty ordered directly from Boeing with 
deliveries between 2025 and 2028. Net of returns of older B737-800s, the airline plans to grow to 82 aircraft in 2023 
and to 87 in 2024.
"It's not like we are growing massively, but keep in mind that since last year, we have grown by 40% going from 50 
to 70 aircraft. And then through the next 24 months, we are growing by approximately 25%," Karlsen said.
He underlined that Norwegian has scheduled its fleet changes such that new deliveries take place in spring, ahead 
of the peak season, while phased-out B737-800s head out in autumn, after the end of the busiest period.
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that Norwegian's current fleet comprises forty B737-800s placed 
with Norwegian Air Shuttle AOC and twenty-eight B737-800s and two B737-8s placed with Norwegian Air Sweden 
AOC.
Thanks partially to strong demand from business travellers, Norwegian posted a NOK910 million Norwegian kroner 
(USD88.8 million) net profit in the third quarter of 2022.

Latvia's airBaltic has commenced its first-ever scheduled service to Africa, with two weekly flights to Marrakesh, 
Morocco.
Launched on October 31, 2022, airBaltic plans to serve the route from its hub in Riga during the 2022/2023 fall and 
winter season, with its fleet of Airbus A220-300 aircraft.
The airline first announced plans to launch scheduled services to Marrakesh in a statement released in June 2022.
"We are delighted to announce the first scheduled route to Africa. We are the leading airline company in the Baltic 
States, we continue to expand our network and add more interesting leisure destinations for the winter season," 
Martin Gauss, CEO of airBaltic said in the statement.
The airline favors Marrakesh as a "popular foreign tourist attraction in Morocco."
While airBaltic is the only airline to operate between Riga and Marrakesh, the carrier joins other traditional and low-
cost airlines, such as Ryanair, Wizz Air, EasyJet, Eurowings, Vueling Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA), 
Iberia British Airways and TAP Air Portugal which also operate flights to Marrakesh.
Founded in 1995, airBaltic's main shareholder is the Latvian state with 97.97% of the shares. The airline's operation 
model combines practices of both traditional airlines and low-cost carriers.
Based in Riga, Latvia, airBaltic is currently the world's largest operator of the Airbus A220-300.
By 2024, the airline expects to have a total of 50 A220-300s. In addition, airBaltic has options to purchase an extra 
30 A220-300 jets.

Wizz says days of flight disruption are over Airlines

Low-cost carrier Wizz Air has reported widening losses in the first half of the year but has said its operations are 
starting to "normalise" after months of disruption.
In the July to September quarter the London-listed group returned to profit, but over the six months to September 
30 it made an operating loss of (EURO)63.8mn, according to results published yesterday. This compares with a 
(EURO)51.9mn loss for the same period in 2021.
Revenue over the period more than doubled, from (EURO)880mn to (EURO)2.19bn.
Severe disruption because of staff shortages and problems at airports pushed Wizz to an operating loss of 
(EURO)284mn for April to June, the first quarter of its financial year.
Chief executive József Váradi said the carrier, a fast-growing rival to low-cost operators such as Ryanair, was now 
in a position to become profitable.
"Our operational performance has recently normalised and we are now back in line with our historically low levels of 
cancellations and flight disruptions," Váradi said.
Váradi added that the problems over the summer had been predominantly a result of issues such as shortages of 
air traffic controllers and delays at airport security. But he said the issues were now resolved.
Wizz says days of flight disruption are over Airlines
"If you look at the last months of operation of the airline, we're back to our standards," Váradi said. "We're operating 
our flights with no significant disruption."
The airline filled 86.9 per cent of its seats in the first half, against a 75.3 per cent load factor for the same period of 
2021. Low-cost airlines typically aim to fill more than 90 per cent of their seats.
Váradi said Wizz had not yet reached the levels of fleet utilisation and load factors of before the pandemic.
But he expressed confidence that any remaining problems would be resolved by the end of Wizz's financial year on 
March 31. "We're quite confident we're going to get there by the end of the financial year, by the start of the next 
financial year," he said.
The company has been hit hard by rising energy costs after abandoning fuel price hedging during the pandemic. 
However, it has said it expects to have similar hedging strategies to competitors in place by April.
"Today we're at a competitive disadvantage," Váradi said. "As of April, we won't have that competitive disadvantage 
versus our competitors."
Wizz said it expected to limit the rise in its non-fuel cost per available seat kilometre (CASK) - an industry standard 
measure of costs - for the October to March half of the current financial year to a single-digit percentage rise above 
pre-pandemic levels.
The company has announced expansion plans in the Middle East and has a joint venture in Abu Dhabi.

On Sunday, October 30th, the first Ryanair flight to Alicante took off from Lodz Airport with a set of passengers on 
board. On Monday, October 31st, the carrier launched regular service from Lodz to Milan Bergamo Airport, and on 
Tuesday, the 1st of November, the first plane took the passages from Lódz to Brussels.
The passengers of the first inauguration flight to Alicante were welcomed with a delicious cake with a photo of our 
new destinations on it and original drinks from the "Spaleni Sloncem" pub.
This is the largest Ryanair schedule from Lodz Airport for many years, also, for passengers, it is the chance to 
extend the summer, have attractive city breaks with a backpack or go skiing in the Alps or Dolomites.
In the winter season, which started on Sunday at all airports and will last until the end of March, Ryanair offers 28 
flights a week from Lódz on 5 routes, including 3 new ones to major European cities.
"This year our offer will be the richest in the history of Lodz Airport. Together with Ryanair, we have a great offer for 
the residents of Lodz and the region to escape the winter where palm trees grow and the sun shines."- says Anna 
Midera, Ph.D., President of the Board and CEO of the Lodz Airport.
"After the best summer charter season in a decade, when we served more than 41,000 passengers, the next 
months look very optimistic. According to our forecasts, next year we will serve 335 thousand passengers, of which 
290 thousand are in regular traffic, and the rest are in charter traffic. This will be the best result in a last decade. It is 
the reliable calculations made on the basis of the offer of seats in the planes of two low-cost carriers: Ryanair and 
Wizz Air and the plans of travel agencies for the summer of 2023. In December, Wizz Air will launch a new route to 
London Luton, serving 35,000 passengers a year. We hope that we will meet the expectations of passengers" - 
says Artur Fraj, General Director of the Lodz Airport.

Ryanair will continue to focus on reducing its net debt and retiring (EURO)1.6 billion ($1.6 billion) of bonds maturing 
next year while it envisages "peak" capital expenditure over the next two years.
During an investor presentation, Ryanair chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said the carrier had made a "significant 
reduction" in net debt despite (EURO)900 million of Capex during the six months ended 30 September. Net debt 
was (EURO)546 million at the end of September versus (EURO)1.5 billion at 31 March.
"We aim to have a broadly zero net debt position by the end of fiscal year 2024," Sorahan added. "We own our 
737s and over 90% are unencumbered which gives us a huge advantage over our competitors in a rising interest 
and lease rate factor environment."
"We're generating very strong cash flows and the fact that we're able to pay down debt is a testament to our 
balance sheet and our ability to recover from seismic shocks like the Covid-19 pandemic," Ryanair Group chief 
executive officer Michael O'Leary added.
"That's very important at a time when interest rates are rising. Ryanair's balance sheet is insulated from rising 
interest rates which will inflate the lease rates and borrowing rates of our competitors and widen the cost advantage 
we have over every other airline in Europe."
O'Leary ruled out paying a shareholder dividend for "at least" the next 12 months while it pays down debt.
Ryanair held total liquidity of (EURO)4.6 billion as of 30 September which will be used to repay (EURO)1.6 billion of 
bonds maturing between March and August 2023 as well as to fund aircraft deliveries over the coming years. The 
carrier estimates around (EURO)2.3 billion capital expenditure for fiscal year 2023 and up to (EURO)2.2 billion for 
2024.
"Some of that could move if Boeing are delayed but the next two years are our peak Capex years," said O'Leary.
Sorahan said that the company will be "opportunistic" around funding aircraft deliveries.
"Thanks to the strong balance sheet we can access the bond market, our banks are usually underrepresented both 
secured and unsecured.
Ryanair targets zero net debt by end of fiscal 2024
"Leasing companies have very little exposure to Ryanair; we'd love to get more," he continued.

Ryanair has signed on with Citi to become the first European airline to deposit funds in the bank's new sustainable 
deposit solution, launched earlier this year.
The agreement will allow the carrier to invest excess cash to support different sustainable financing projects across 
Citi's portfolio, such as renewable energy, water conservation, healthcare and education in emerging markets.
Funds invested are allocated to finance or refinance assets in a portfolio of eligible green and social finance 
projects, based on the criteria set out in the Citi green bond framework, social finance framework and social bond 
for affordable housing framework, and support Ryanair's sustainability agenda.
"Ryanair is proud to be leading sustainable aviation in Europe, which is further evidenced by our partnership with 
Citi to deposit funds in their new Sustainable Deposit Solution," commented Thomas Fowler, Ryanair director of 
sustainability.
"This will not only help us manage our finances more sustainably but will further drive our sustainability agenda in 
whole as we support several sustainability projects across Citi's portfolio, from water conservation to affordable 
housing and beyond."
"Citi is helping our clients to progress their own ESG priorities by providing the opportunity to support eligible 
environmental and social projects in Citi's portfolios," said David Tsui, Citi's global sustainability head of deposit and 
investment products.
"We are delighted to partner with Ryanair as the first European airline to deposit funds in our recently launched 
Sustainable Deposit Solution. We have committed to financing and facilitating $1 trillion in sustainable finance by 
2030 as part of goal to further the acceleration to a sustainable, low carbon economy," Tsui added.
Citi's new deposit solution, first launched in Asia Pacific in August, follows a number of sustainable finance products 
introduced by Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions in the region last year, including sustainable supply chain financing 
and sustainable trade loans.

Ryanair Group's operating profit pre-exceptional items surged to (EURO)1.4 billion ($1.4 billion) for the three 
months ended 30 September, from a (EURO)254 million operating profit in the same period of 2021 due to the 
strong recovery in traffic over the summer period.
Revenue increased 125% year on year to (EURO)4 billion in the July-September quarter while operating costs 
increased 70% to (EURO)2.6 billion.
The European low-cost airline group recorded an exceptional unrealised mark-to-market post-tax loss of 
(EURO)125 million on the company's jet fuel call options as of 30 September. Fuel costs more than doubled to 
(EURO)1.1 billion during the third quarter due to increased production and higher fuel costs.
The carrier said it is raising its fiscal-year 2023 traffic guidance to 168 million passengers, versus 166.5 million 
carried pre-Covid-19.
"If we are fortunate to avoid such negative events like Covid and Ukraine in H2 then, thanks to our very strong 
traffic recovery, our advantageous fuel and currency hedges and our widening cost and market share leadership 
over competitors, we are hopeful that we will minimise our winter losses which would enable us to deliver an FY23 
profit after tax pre-exceptionals in a range of (EURO)1 billion to (EURO)1.2 billion," Ryanair stated.
The carrier reported total liquidity of (EURO)4.6 billion, including (EURO)1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, 
(EURO)2.8 billion of financial assets convertible to cash after three months, as well as (EURO)23 million of 
restricted cash.
Net debt was reduced to (EURO)546 million at the end of September versus (EURO)1.5 billion at 31 March, despite 
(EURO)900 million of capital expenditure in the first six months of fiscal-year 2023.
Gross debt increased by (EURO)60 million to (EURO)5 billion, primarily due to the extension of operating lease 
terms on 24 Airbus A320 aircraft until 2028 at lower rentals, offset by debt repayments during the period.
Net finance expenses decreased 19% to (EURO)36 million due to lower net debt, at mainly fixed interest rates, 
offset by higher cash balances and rising deposit interest rates.
Ryanair profit soars to â,¬1.4bn
"Almost all of the group's fleet of 737s are owned and over 90% are unencumbered which widens our cost 
advantage at a time when interest rates and leasing costs of our competitors are rising," Ryanair stated.
"Our focus over the next year is the repayment of (EURO)1.6 billion of maturing bonds while returning our balance 
sheet to a broadly zero net debt position."
Ryanair has taken delivery of 77 Boeing 737 Max aircraft as of 30 September with around 50 due for delivery ahead 
of the summer 2023 season.

Boeing narrowbody delivery activity increased in October with 22 Boeing 737 Max units handed over to customers, 
up from 18 units in October last year, according to Boeing data.
Air Lease, BBAM and 777 Partners accounted for five 737 Max deliveries and two units went to business jet 
customers, with Alaska Airlines, Gol, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, Copa Airlines, Ryanair and Lion Air 
making up the remainder.
Boeing 787 deliveries continued to ramp up with six units delivered, including one 787-10 each to Air France-KLM 
and All Nippon Airways, one 787-9 each to Lufthansa and Air Lease and one 787-8 to American Airlines.
Jefferies estimates that Boeing ended the third quarter of 2022 with roughly 115 787s in inventory, with production 
to increase to three per month on average during 2023, increasing to five at the end of 2023 and into 2024, with 
higher demand supporting production rate of six in 2025.
Year-to-date deliveries stand at 363 aircraft, including 299 737 Max units and 15 787s.
The manufacturer booked strong sales activity during October with 122 orders, mainly owing to large 737 Max 
orders placed by Alaska Airlines and International Airlines Group (IAG) for 52 and 50 737 Max aircraft, respectively.
Emirates placed an order for another five 777Fs while Fedex added one 767-300F to its orderbook.
Ten 787-9 aircraft orders were placed with an undisclosed customer.
Boeing has received 550 net orders in the first 10 months of the year, with 114 conversions/cancellations and none 
of these during October.
Its commercial backlog rose from 4,354 to 4,441 orders.

Ryanair outlook turns positive
Ryanair outlook turns positive
AirFinance Journal

A strong recovery in air travel, accelerated deleveraging and a large unrestricted cash position has prompted Fitch 
Ratings to revise Ryanair Holding's outlook to positive from stable.
The agency has also affirmed the company's long-term issuer default rating (IDR) and Ryanair's senior unsecured 
rating at BBB.
Ryanair forecasts air traffic demand to last until the peak Christmas travel period, based on forward bookings. The 
airline has also modestly increased its traffic guidance for fiscal-year 2023 to 168 million from 166.5 million, 
equating to a 13% increase on pre-Covid-19 traffic.
The agency expects Ryanair to deleverage to within funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage of below 
1.5x in 2023, one year ahead of Fitch's previous forecast.
"Strong deleveraging capacity results from strong traffic recovery and solid financial performance in 1HFY23 that 
we expect to continue in 3QFY23, albeit hampered by a tougher macroeconomic outlook," Fitch stated.
Earlier this month Ryanair confirmed plans to aim for broadly zero net debt by the beginning of fiscal-year 2024.
Fitch noted that Ryanair has also taken advantage of many carriers' bankruptcy and legacy carriers' capacity 
reduction to deploy its new fleet of 71 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
Ryanair expects its fleet to grow to about 620 aircraft at the end of fiscal-year 2026 from 466 units as of the end of 
2020.
Ryanair held total liquidity of (EURO)4.6 billion ($4.8 billion) as of 30 September, which will be used to repay 
(EURO)1.6 billion of bonds maturing between March and August 2023 as well as to fund aircraft deliveries over the 
coming years. The carrier estimates around (EURO)2.3 billion capital expenditure for fiscal year 2023 and up to 
(EURO)2.2 billion for 2024.
"Some of that could move if Boeing are delayed but the next two years are our peak Capex years," Ryanair 
Holdings chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said earlier this month.
Ryanair outlook turns positive
Fitch's outlook adjustment is also based on Ryanair's unencumbered asset base, with over 90% of its 737 fleet 
unencumbered as of 30 September, which Fitch says "increases its financial flexibility and funding options, 
especially considering its current environment of high interest rates."
The agency noted that Ryanair is one of its highest-rated airlines, together with Southwest Airlines, both of which 
profit from their low-cost business model with comparable pre-pandemic net leverage and operating margins.
"Wizz Air is considerably smaller than Ryanair, but also benefits from a low-cost position and solid liquidity. It has a 
strong market position in the growing central and eastern European market," Fitch continued.

Nov 01, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 A new month and an opportunity to look back. What do we see for new delivery estimates through October 2022? 
Here are some notes from our delivery tracker. Official OEM numbers will be published around the 10th of 
November.  
The duopoly remains out of balance. This is a concern for the entire commercial aviation sector.  
Airbus is out delivering Boeing by 1.3 to 1 and Airbus has hardly any freighter business YTD Airbus has a 53.3% 
delivery market share to Boeing's 39.3% 
This is despite the top delivery customers for Boeing being Southwest, Ryanair, Alaska, and United, respectively 
The most delivered new aircraft are MAX8 (216), A321neo (193), A320neo (159), and MAX9 (45) - 33 new MAX8-
200s have been delivered through YTD October  
The disparity between Airbus and Boeing is writ large - Boeing needs the MAX10 ASAP The threat of cancellation 
is a double-edged sword for Boeing - Boeing needs the MAX10 and cancellation weakens the MAX family where it 
needs the most support 
In terms of twin aisles, Airbus delivered 40 A350-900s, 8 A350-1000s, 16 A330-900s, and 2 A330-800s. Boeing 
delivered 19 777Fs, 13 767Fs, 11 787-8s, 4 747Fs 3 777s, 2 787-10s and one 787-9 
Airbus is coming to the freight business late. The freighter (and military) business has been a savior for Boeing. 
Embraer remains primarily a regional-focused OEM. It delivered three times as many E-175s and E2s.

Got bitten by the aviation bug and ended up an Avgeek. Then the data bug got me, making me a curious Avgeek 
seeking data-driven logic. Also, I appreciate conversations with smart people from whom I learn so much. 
Summary: I am very fortunate to work with and converse with great people.
